economy,Can someone explain the U.S. Federal debt to me?,I recently read an article on reddit about how the U.S. national debt is majorly owned by entities and individuals within the U.S. If the debt is owned by the U.S. how can we owe ourselves? Also they were talking about how the debt consists of bonds we have not paid back. Why do we keep selling bonds if we cannot pay back the ones we have already sold? I assume it it has something to do with nationwide economic collapse but that is just an assumption. Please help.,finance,1388536825
Bitcoin,"I'm beginning to think the U.S. either created Bitcoin, or merely wants it to thrive","You don't have companies like Fortress, who have $55 Billion under management, announce things like a Bitcoin trust without knowing they can do it and a 'thumbs up'.

The US govt knows that long term the Dollar in it's current form is fucked. You can't deny mathematics.

As interest rates rise on Treasuries, Bitcoin will be one of the few flights to safety, in my opinion.

Bitcoin,The real and imagined problems with Bitcoin[part1],"The more you read about bitcoin, the more patterns will emerge as to what people think will be the reason bitcoin cannot succeed. Many of these concerns are silly... and others are worthy of further thinking. So in no particular order I shall list them

Perhaps the worst argument of all against bitcoin is that it's creator is a mystery. This is a bad argument. It's like saying that your software calculator is evil or bad because you do not know the name of the programmer who wrote it. Bitcoin is just a program and a program is just a tool. The source code is open and transparent. Everyone involved knows the rules and there is no mystery. So why would no one want to take credit then for the creation of something so important? I can think of one glaring reason among others.... you will notice that bitcoin investors will typically not answer questions about how many bitcoin they own. That's the smart thing to do. It's estimated that satoshi has somewhere between 1-2 million bitcoins. If his identity was known people might try to steal it from him. They might kidnap members of his family or people that he loves. Having that many bitcoins and letting it be known is simply dangerous. 

Another silly argument against bitcoins is that it is a ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is no more a ponzi scheme than a stock is. If  someone buys a stock and that company starts to go south the stock price will fall and the latest ones to buy in to the stock will lose the most. In a way that resembles a ponzi scheme... but that's all. The only way you could even claim that bitcoin resembles this is if you assume that it's going to fail. So right away anyone who calls it a scheme is telling you that it is going to fail and that they can predict the future.

Another problem frequently cited around bitcoin is its volatility. It has been claimed that bitcoin can't be used as a currency because it is too volatile. The problem with this theory is that reality proves it wrong. Even during the times of its greatest volatility there are still transactions happening. People still use it as a currency. A merchant who accepts bitcoin can tie in with a company like coinbase and immediately convert to cash and assume no risk holding it. Things that are sold for bitcoins can be tied to the price of anything quite easily with simple programs. You could have an online store and have everything priced in bitcoins and have the amounts tied to something like dollars or even gold.  This doesn't mean volatility isn't a problem. It can make things pretty inconvenient , but it isn't as big of a deal as some people make it out to be. The reason why is because the volatility of bitcoin is linked to it's userbase. The userbase cannot increase (or decrease) exponentially forever. The amount of people joining or leaving bitcoin won't continually be changing by large amounts in short periods of time. Bitcoin is still in it's infancy so for the time being you can expect volatility. If all of the sudden you had 2 or 3 or 4 times as many people using the dollar as there was days before you would probably be seeing volatility with it too (despite how fast the Fed seems to be at creating new ones) . Just like a stock, the deeper the markets are the less volatility there is.

Intrinsic value is another often cited problem with bitcoin. Some theorists claim that bitcoin needs an intrinsic value to enforce that it will always be worth something. Gold if not used as money can still be used as jewelry. Dollars, although not backed by gold, are backed by men with guns. Some people claim that bitcoin isn't just a currency but rather it is a network and that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is this network.   What someone is really saying when they say that money needs intrinsic value is that it needs to be good at something besides being money to be good at being money. That's pretty unnecessary. All that intrinsic value does for gold as a store of value is create a psychological effect. It adds a price floor. But that price floor isn't the actual price and therefore it is only creating a psychological crutch. I'm not saying that it is entirely useless. A psychological crutch adds confidence and confidence is good. But it also adds burden. A money that is backed by something like gold is burdened by gold. Can you still instantly transport it across the world? Could you drop an empty safe in the ocean and then send it into the safe while it was sinking at a depth of over a mile? You can send bitcoins in that fashion. You could keep all the gold in some centralized place and send the money but then... that introduces storage costs and centralization and counterparty risks. Bitcoin obviously has value to some people and it is already used as a currency so to say it can't be a currency because of this reason or that is kind of ignorant.

Many economists claim that bitcoin is doomed because it will lead to deflationary spirals. Why spend something now when you know it's going to be worth more tomorrow? is the oft-cited question. The problem is that economists have certain ideas and they try to fit reality to those ideas rather than their ideas to reality. There are three main counterpoints to this. THe most popular one is that there is a cost in deferring payment. Why buy a computer now when in a year you know you can get a more powerful one for the same price or cheaper? Because you need it now. Another counter point is that with bitcoin a deflationary spiral is essentially impossible because you will never get the whole market to agree that the price is going up. In any market... especially bitcoin you have bulls and you have bears. If the price suddenly rose 10 times you can bet that a lot of people would be trying to get rid of their bitcoins by ""buying"" goods or dollars with them. Nothing only goes up in value. If it did then it's chart would look like a straight line. Bitcoin doesn't have such a chart.  Economists tend to look at bitcoin in isolation when they talk about deflation. But can the sudden and shortlived bubbles that bitcoin experiences harm the economy? If bitcoin was the only currency to exist then you could make the argument that merchants would suffer during these times because there was less spending. But we don't exist in such a world (and nor will there ever likely be a world where the only currency is just 1 digital cryptocurrency) . And even if we did ..... those periods of rapid deflation are not sustainable and short lived.",cryptocurrency,1388539457

This server is used 24 hours a day and needs a CONSTANT uptime (no downtimes no lag, no DCs NOTHING) and Shrapnet cant quite cover that.

Over the past 6 or so months after a few hours of users being in a channel it will start to get a delay. (Words will be cut off and lag will eventually appear in channel until all affected users reboot the client/connection to server)

Along with that every now and then (once a month or so) it will get random lag spikes (4000ms ping to server for every user, all users affected) causing massive lag and distortion. Rebooting client and logging back into server, channels slowly populate over the course of 30 seconds... Its horrible.

personalfinance,Just wanted to share my financial kung-fu that I pulled off this month. Maybe some of you can get some ideas.,"If you havent heard of Uber, go Google it, along with Lyft.  Basically, you become a (in California) legal cab with the push of a button.  People hit a button on their phone and it calls the nearest car, you get the summons, accept, and go pick them up.  You drive them wherever, and then it charges their credit card and pays you 80% of the total fair, NOT BAD!  You get to turn on and off the phone at will, basically choosing your hours on the spot.  It's pretty nice so far.  Only problem  it requires a 4 door car due to insurance issues. Then there's me.

Im a grad student with around 15K in credit card debt, not to mention nearly 100K in student loan.  I make 24K a year as a grad student and have barely been scraping by.  I also drive a paid off two door car. I'm almost done with grad school and will move on to greener pastures, but things were getting tight when I heard about Uber.  I wanted in.  It sounded perfect for my lifestyle.  I do experiments, and when they're incubating I can do this while I wait, or while I have writers block.

My first move was to go see about a new (to me) car.  I knew I needed a four door, so I went to the dealership. They valued my car at only 3200 and then tried to sell me a 35K car, or at least lease it, you know, because of the 'burden of ownership'.  Dicks.  Side note, the guy texted and bugged me for over a week.  I had to tell him sternly ""no thank you""  and he actually got mad at me.  Then apologized when he realized I could get him in huge trouble.  I hate buying cars.  Anyway...

So that didnt seem like a good idea.  Instead I started hunting autotrader.com.  After some digging I found a 2009 Toyota Corolla with only 28K miles for 11500 after tax and tags.  I got a used car loan at 2.39% and bought the car right away.  I immediately got signed up with Uber (took about a week, no in person interview, just filling out stuff online) and started driving after Christmas.  In 4 days I've made 550 dollars, 400 just tonight, and the rest in less than 5 hours.  This is really getting me out of a jam.  Now the gravy.

Because I didnt trade my car in, and am instead selling it third party, I'm going to take what I get (low would be 6500, high is 8500 according to Kellie Blue book and some other sources as well as my own digging) and pay off debt.  I'm *not* going to use this money to pay off the car loan, however.  That interest rate is really sweet.  No need to rush that one.  Instead I'm going to use it to pay down the highest interest credit card debt and keep Ubering to make up the difference.  That means I get to take around 4K of debt at 14% interest, 1K of debt at around 11% and the rest around 6.4%, and turn it all into 11500 of 2.39% secured loan debt.  I now have a new source of income to close the gap in the value of my car (which is also much nicer than my old car and has half the miles on it)  I figure after I net  the difference then it's all profit, which should only take a few more months.  

Assuming I can sell the car for a decent price, this makes a lot of sense from where I'm sitting.  I do have to hurry up and sell my old car because I'm paying the insurance on it, but I should be able to get rid of it this month.  When I do, I'll have spent one month, a little creativity, and some frustration to have totally fixed my financial troubles. My interest payments will be rock bottom low, and I'll have extra income and a fun new hobby that MAKES me money.  Tonight was a great way to start a new year.

About Ubering/Lyfting:  For Lyft and the cheapest Uber (UberX) you just need a good working, great looking 2007 model or later 4 door sedan with no salvage title (I think). I dont know what the nicer Ubers require, Uber black and Uber SUV.  I know they have to be luxury cars, I dont know which ones and I dont know the pay scale.  You must be able to pass a background check and have a clean driving record and show proof of insurance for the car and registration with your name on it.  Then you do some online training, wait about 4 days, and then a phone shows up and you can just get started.  You kinda have to live in a big city. I think Uber is only in 50 cities around the world.  The business model doesnt hold up in more rural areas so far.  The pay is hit and miss, you have to time it right, like Friday nights, but it's definitely a viable way to finance a new car and make some extra money.  Lots of working families around here suddenly have SUVs and luxury cars because they're all getting in on this Ubering thing.  Uber drivers have been known to clear 1000$ in a night.

Bonus value.  Because so many people are Ubering in LA, the streets were really empty tonight.  I gave around 20 rides.  That's 20 cars that were not on the streets tonight, and if that's even 1 drunk driver, well, yeah.  But now multiply by the thousands of other Uber drivers, and suddenly the streets are totally empty and almost everyone out there is stone cold sober.  I love technology.

Hope there are some useful ideas in here for other people.  Happy New Years!

EDIT:  I do not advertise for Uber or Lyft.  This is my own personal story.  I'm excited by the change I've made and I wanted to share.  Sorry if you think otherwise.  I have a long comment history and no financial incentive to get MORE drivers on the road to compete with me.  Also, it's a rather personal 'advertisement' if you ask me.  I was more focused on the car buying/selling and the debt rearrangement than the actual job.  It came out a win/win/win.

personalfinance,Contribute to 401k/403b or pay off student loans?,"Suze Orman's book Young, Fabulous, and Broke has a mini section that answered a question I've had about my own situation. I have $14,000 in student loans @ 4.75%. After 24 on time payments, the interest rate will dip to 4.25%. My plan for 2014 calls for me to get the employer contribution on my 403b (job doesn't start till August), max my Roth IRA that I have in Vanguard, and assuming I get an HDHP max out my HSA. After other expenses including paying about $250 minimum on my student loans, I will have a couple hundred dollars left over which I could either put towards the balance of my student loans or towards my 403b to go above and beyond the employer match. 

Suze Orman says that if your student loan rates are under 8% you should only pay the minimums and put anything extra towards retirement. While 8% seems a bit high to me for this, I'm well below at 4.75%. I understand the reasoning behind both: 1) pay only the minimums because you will likely get a better investment on the market in 2014, the interest rate will dip to a level not too far above inflation, and it's better to invest early and often for retirement, but paying off student debt is good in this situation because 2) you are getting a guaranteed 4.75% return on you money and no one ever regretted paying down debt. 

What does /r/personalfinance think of Suze Orman's advice? It seems sound to me, and I plan on following it. But am I missing anything else?",finance,1388590406

investing,What are your thoughts on mREITs?,"So I've been looking at NLY.  mREITs inherently high dividend yeild (12% for NLY) and low P/E ratio (~3) makes them an attractive investment.  This past year was a tough one for NLY, reducing its price by nearly 50%, but I'm thinking this may be a good opportunity to jump in.  With the FEDs promise to keep short term interest rates near zero and the increase in the long term interest rate the margin between the two will benefit mREITs mortgage backed security (MBS) purchases.

Also, many of the reported losses for NLY this past fiscal year was a factor of repositioning, from selling MBS that were squeezed from poor yield spread. This should improve for the reasons stated above.

Finally, NLYs fiscal year revenues and EPS has risen annually over the past 3 years.

My first question is, how do I set up my finances in order to reduce my ""Expected Family Contribution""? I have been saving to go back to school for a long time (3 years at a full time job) keeping my expenses low and budgeting as good as I can. As a result, I have saved up about $11,000 ($10,000 savings, $1,000 checking) and I've got around $12,000 invested with Vanguard in Index Funds. About $7000 of the money invested with Vanguard came from a different investment that my grandfather set up for me when I was born and the rest I have contributed on my own. 

I'm considered ""independent"" since I am 24 so I don't have to include any information about my parents finances or income. Will the money I have saved up effect how much I might be eligible for significantly? Or is my income level ($27,000 adjusted gross income) low enough where I'll still get a decent amount?

personalfinance,I opened a credit card and of course created a whole lot of debt that I don't have the time or money to pay back. I don't know what to do.,"I know that it was irresponsible, and I'm in dire need of help, not lecture. So I'll start from the beginning.  
  
I'm a full time college student and I'm currently double majoring. Besides that, I am in a sorority and I have a VERY SMALL part time job, which is currently all of the time I can afford to spare. It's 6 hours a week cleaning for a friend. That's it. I get $50 a week.  
  
Now my debt, I have on a credit card which I've used to buy supplies for school. I am in graphic design and ceramics. These can both be expensive money-wise. For example, I had to buy paper for a project that cost $70 for FOUR sheets of large black paper.  
  
When I took out student loans, I've always requested that my parents allow me to take out a little extra for supplies considering I don't poop money, but they never allowed it, and they cosign so I had to oblige. So two years I opened a credit card and it all went downhill from there. I currently owe $8,500. This is admittedly not all supplies. I have purchased Christmas, birthday etc presents, as well as food in-between classes many a time. I realize how irresponsible I've been and I have been running from this problem and just letting it build and build and build with a mindframe of ""screw it, it's never going to get any better"", but I've decided that it can and it will and it HAS TO.  
  
Now I don't know what to do. I'm totally and utterly lost. All I currently know is that I should probably call my bank and try to get them to lower the interest and somehow freeze the account so the interest stops building, but I really don't think I can do that. I don't think I can stop the interest. The minimum payments due are $220 a month. I make maybe $200 a month. Like I said, I make $50 a week. I already put all of that towards the card but yet I only see the debt growing. My interest rate is maybe 15%? If that's what APR is. I honestly don't even know. I wish I had learned these things in high school.  
  
I am planning on working my ass off in the studio to try to sell as much ceramics as I can through Etsy, and at least that's a start. It goes towards my education and debt. The biggest problem here is that I DON'T HAVE TIME. Every hour is precious, and I spend a lot of it doing school work or sorority events. I CAN drop the sorority, but I really prefer not to considering the connections and friendships are very valuable to me and will continue to be so after graduation.

Bitcoin,New Year's Resolution: improve the zero-trust world!,"Bitcoin opponents often say that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  That is completely wrong.  Bitcoin's great contribution to the world is the ability to perform zero-trust transactions with absolute certainty, without the involvement of a trusted third party.

The legal/fiat system was designed to make sure that contracts can be enforced.  The cost of the system - our implicit trust of the third party - has been great.  During its existence, the Federal Reserve has plundered 99% of the assets within its reach.

With zero-trust payments and contracts, these criminals will lose their lucrative scam.  We no longer need the police, the courts, the banks and the lawyers to enforce agreements and perform transactions.

As I write this, I am watching my MtGox account.  I made a bitcoin withdrawal many hours ago (and my account is at 0), but nothing has posted on the blockchain.  I had to trust them, and they will probably eventually give me my money.  

I would like to live in a world where MtGox could not exists simply because a  company asking for your trust would get laughed out of business immediately.  We have to come up with some form of a distributed exchange so that MtGoxes can be put out of their misery.

I would like to live in a world where corporations no longer use accountants, auditors, transfer agents and investment banks.  Instead, zero-trust systems and blockchains absolutely guarantee the veracity of their reporting and both authenticate ownership of stock and act as the distribution mechanism.

A world where the authenticty of any document is a simple and irrefutable fact, not subject to 'factfinding' by a bunch of highly paid liars and deliberatly ignorant juries.

Between January and June, the price of gold dived from about $1,675 to less than $1,200 an ounce. In the second half, gold staged a partial recovery, rising to the $1,400 level, before dropping back to and finding some support at $1,200 again.

Admittedly, we had expected a much better performance. At the beginning of 2013, our forecast was that gold would rebound to a record high of $2,200 by the end of the year, helped by a renewed escalation of the eurozone crisis. We had anticipated some weakness as the US Federal Reserve gradually scaled back its asset purchases, but still thought gold would hold up well.

In the event, pretty much everything that could go wrong did go wrong, for gold, that is. First, our fears that the eurozone crisis would re-escalate in 2013 proved unfounded thanks in part to the continued calming influence of the European Central Bank. What's more, when problems worsened in Cyprus, the threat of gold sales to finance the bailouts for banks further undermined sentiments toward the precious metal.

Second, the gold market initially reacted more negatively than expected to the Fed's move to the end quantitative easing. The combination of rising real yields and fading inflation fears has proved a toxic mix. The strength of the US economic recovery has also maintained confidence in the dollar despite another round of brinkmanship in Congress over the debt ceiling.

Third, the strong performance of equities in developed markets has made it hard to make a compelling investment case for gold. Huge outflows from gold exchange-traded funds have dominated the headlines for much of the year. The demand from households and central banks in emerging economies has been relatively resilient, but sales in India have been hit hard by import restrictions.

The consensus is that these factors will undermine the price of gold further in 2014. Indeed, other headwinds may build. The swing from central banks selling to buying could be complete. Producers are reportedly starting to sell their output in the futures market to lock in prices that are still historically high.

But taking each of these factors in turn, we think that the balance of risks to prices lies on the upside. The eurozone's fundamental problems have still not been fixed and another difficult year lies ahead. Deflation is also a growing threat. The conventional wisdom is that deflation is negative for the price of gold, but in the context of the eurozone it may simply exacerbate the debt problems of the weaker economies and force the ECB to loosen monetary policy further. And if pushed to the edge, governments seem far more likely to default than to sell the nations' gold reserves.

Also, the Fed has announced the first, small reduction in its asset purchases, removing one uncertainty hanging over the market. US monetary expansion is likely to continue through most, if not all, of 2014, and US interest rates are set to remain low for a significantly longer time. Other globally important central banks will also keep their policies loose, or even ease them further, led by Bank of Japan.

Finally, demand from emerging economies should pick up again. Restrictions on the Indian market are likely to be lifted this year, which is one of several potential catalysts for a rebound in prices. Producer hedging may be a negative but prices have already fallen to levels that are not far above marginal costs, raising the prospect of a shortage of newly mined supply.

Overall, we see plenty of scope for gold to bounce back this year. Indeed, the poor performance in 2013 has left the precious metal looking attractive again compared to other assets, including equities. The bursting of the Bitcoin bubble may even make gold look more appealing to Chinese investors. We will review all our commodity forecasts, but now we are happy to reiterate that the price of gold will revisit $1,400 this year, and probably go higher. 
The consensus is that the price of gold will, at best, grind lower this year, as the support from loose US monetary policy gradually weakens.

personalfinance,Should I sell my 'investment' property to save for a larger deposit on a house to live in? - Seeking advice,"Hi,

I am a 28 year old, living in Australia. After graduating from university I took a job in a city a great distance from where my family lives. After 2 years, i got a position which paid $110,000.

In 2012 I brought a small apartment to live in and went 50/50 with my parents. The apartment cost $350,000 overall and so my mortgage was $175,000 (no deposit required). The interest rate on the loan is 5.2% which makes my monthly repayments $1062 per month.

Also in 2012 I ended up needing major surgery, after toughing it out for almost a year i decided that it would be best if i left my job (became too tough on my body after the surgery) and move back to my home town. I also decided to make a career change so that i could work from home, this however meant that i needed to take a massive pay cut. I am now on ~$65,000. 

I Currently live with my girlfriend and we pay $880 a month for rent. We are looking at buying a house together (along with getting married) in the next few years. We are both good at saving/budgeting and she earns about $80,000. We are living comfortably and saving $1000 each a month for a house deposit, however i am also paying off my mortgage by my self, while she saves for the wedding.

What I would like to get some advice on, is.. Should i look at selling my apartment (should break-even). It is currently bringing in ~$1,000 ($500 goes to me, the other to my parents) a month on rent. So it is paying for half the mortgage. If i where to sell, i would then be able to save for a deposit on a house to live in faster, and also pay it off quicker. Or would it be a wiser decision to just keep the apartment?

Please let me know what you guys would do in my situation, or maybe raise some points to think on!

Thanks.",finance,1388657853

personalfinance,"Facing a decision to refinance my car and build credit, or leave it at the fantastic rate it currently has an not build credit.","My sister moved out of the country about a year ago and left me her car, a 2012 Honda Civic with 15k left on the loan (starting out at 19k). I took over paying for the car just by changing the bank account funds are removed from, she is still technically the owner and all financial information is in her name. We decided to not put it in my name for two main reasons: 


1.	Her departure was very sudden, and subsequently we didn’t really have time to nail down all of the details of getting me added to the loan, or transferring it into my name before she was gone.  

2.	Her interest rates are insane because her credit is stellar and she got some great one-time deals. The monthly payment is $339.18, on average $8.00 of that is interest.


Now, the loan is down the 10k and I am starting to feel like I am missing a great opportunity to build credit. All of the payments are paid on time every month; I have never missed or been late on a payment and it is well within my means to maintain this for the remaining 30 payments. If my sister adds me to the loan, it will require getting a full refinance, which will absolutely increase the interest rates. If I take it entirely in my name I am sure it would tank them as well. I can easily afford to pay higher rates, but obviously it’s nice to know the majority of the money I am putting into the car is staying in the car.


My credit score is currently 668, and the only thing I have building it is a small credit card which I also pay off entirely every month (I frequently dip past the 50% mark though, so it’s not a perfect credit generator). My husband and I own a home we are paying off as well, and I could be placed on that loan soon which could also help. 


So: should I refinance and take the hit on interest in favor of building my credit for the next 2.6 years, or is that really not a big enough deal to justify rocking the boat and paying more in interest?",finance,1388680447
Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's a pyramid scheme right? So is every other social construct- traditional currency, government, religion. But what does bitcoin 'give back' to society?","I'm genuinely interested- I'm trying to wrap my mind around it. I think I'm beginning to understand the technology and the economics and it's clear that bitcoin provides people with some utility. However, that utility seems to have primarily fallen into two categories: (1) the profit that comes from being at the top of a pyramid scheme and (2) doing illegal things (whether they're noble, like moving money out of a repressive country or less noble, like evading taxes).

A third utility seems to have fueled the latest expansion of the bitcoin network: the possibility of reducing the costs of online transactions. However, it mainly reduces costs for those doing the selling, both because of the difference in the volume of transactions and because they shoulder supply costs (I assume that bitcoin is easier from a developer's standpoint- although, at the moment, it's foolish for businesses to not accept traditional payment, so really it currently INCREASES supply costs). But I don't currently pay anything for the purchases I make online: I entrust my money's security to a Federal Credit Union and I'm very happy with it.

So, please: explain to me why I (and other non-early adaptors with an open mind like myself) should buy into this scheme.",cryptocurrency,1388682785
personalfinance,What to do with $20k?,"Do we put money towards equity in our house, our car, or invest in our 401k?

This summer, we will have saved about $20,000 in addition to our emergency fund.  We will also be buying a vehicle in the ballpark of $35,000 (we buy quality and keep for a very long time.)  Our credit union will loan us money at 2%.  Our mortgage is at about 4%.  We will need to put $8,000 more dollars towards our mortgage to have 20% equity in order to shed our $45 a month PMI charge (which I believe is tax deductible still?).  These interest rates are relatively low and I feel as though it may be best to put most of the money into our 401k (we're 30).

Well there is the laundry list. I have been researching consolidation (based on the fact the larger amount private loans are my highest interest rate). I understand the minuses of increasing my overall debt, but I am figuring it will loosen the tight grip on my financial position at the moment. Right now, my ends are meeting and working paycheck to the paycheck with around 5k credit card debt and a 13,000 car loan. On the plus side, I have a descent job that pays around 500 a week.

I am here pleading to reddit for some good advice. I will provide any other information if I can.  

EDIT:
I started at this current position last March have made large strides in skill set and significance to the department. The car debt is currently on loan with a bank. I bought the car in my name with my dad cosigning (he encouraged me to buy the because he dealt with the car dealership before and the car was at a good price, $13000 for a 2010 mazda 6 with 27,000 miles). What could I do to trade in? How does that work?

During the busy season, it can be upwards of 8k/month, but during the slow season it can be nothing (but that's when I'm busy meeting with clients to book for the busy times, so I'm still working then).

We live very frugally, with total monthly expenses being about $1600 for the two of us. No cable, cars are paid for, etc. Our pocket money is about $100 a month each.

Bitcoin,"Happy 5th Anniversary Bitcoin, lets give a political voice to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Bomb!","Our Federal Government’s political power is based on the ability to control money.  The ideals of freedom are based on the liberty of money and trade. Establishing a competing currency to the U.S. Dollar is a primary issues for individuals to regain the wealth of their production.  The fiat currencies of governments around the world have stolen decades of wealth from the people and it is time to phase out government fiat. To change the way things are done, the money power must be shifted to the people. Bitcoin allows individuals the liberty to bypass the control and destructiveness of government fiat currency.  With every transaction, vendor, and service that uses Bitcoin as a means of exchange in the Bitcoin economy, the end of government control over money becomes closer to a reality for those involved.

As a digital currency, Bitcoin brings a unique spin on an old idea of sound money.  There are several properties of money and Bitcoin fits them all well, but the value is clear to everyone exchanging Bitcoins; it is the money of the people. Each day Bitcoin becomes more and more legitimate in different sectors of the economy. The one sector that will put a damper on Bitcoin’s future growth is government.  Government will try to put regulations and barriers around the use of Bitcoins in the future, this is because it is a threat to government control over money. I purpose that Bitcoiners push early and often to break into the halls of government to show that Bitcoin and other competing currencies are not going anywhere.

I am currently running for State Senate in Nevada in the 2014 election cycle, and I want to do something completely unique and pioneering in the political process.   I intend on running a campaign heavily financed with Bitcoin contributions.   My goal is to have 80% of my funding to come from the Bitcoin economy and 20% from USD. I want to reinvest all Bitcoin contributions into the Bitcoin economy where and when I am able.  Putting Bitcoins back into print shops, contractors, web services, and whatever else is possible in the Bitcoin economy. This will grow the use of Bitcoin and new vendors will push to enter the market.  It is vital that Bitcoiners show that they are politically active and involved in setting policy.  Soon after my campaign has a successful outcome with the use of Bitcoin, more political types will start to listen and follow our lead.  I predict that Bitcoin will establish leverage in the political process very quickly.

I am organizing my campaign to conduct a Bitcoin Bomb on January 3rd, 2014 and beyond, which is the fifth anniversary of the founding of Bitcoin.  Every fraction of a Bitcoin donated to my campaign will bring more and more attention to Bitcoin as a viable and usable currency by the people for all things. My campaign budget for victory in my primary against an establishment Republican is $175,000 USD or around ฿ 213 BTC at $823 per BTC.  With our 80% goal of BTC funding, at the current exchange rate it is around ฿170 BTC that we want to raise from the Bitcoin Economy to promote, bring awareness to Bitcoin, and elect a pro-Bitcoin candidate to state office in Nevada and give the Bitcoin economy a political voice.

personalfinance,New job - 401k &amp; High Interest Debt,"I asked this in the ""Moronic Monday"" but didn't get a reply, so here goes a new post...

I'm making headway toward my huge consumer debt (see post history for background; I've since developed a budget and have been better about my spending!). But I'm still paying some pretty high interest rates on my consumer debt. Here's where I'm considering doing something that is probably ""moronic.""

I will be leaving my current job for a job that pays ~20% more so my wife can stay at home with the kids (this is actually more than she brought home working once daycare costs were factored in, so I'm gaining income even though she won't be working). So, I'm going to have to do something with my 401k.

I'm considering taking a cash payout for my 401k and paying off the high interest credit cards, several of which are above 20% interest.

The new job is helping with relocation (paying costs to sell old house and to buy new house).  I'm not sure how depleting the 401k (but paying off debt) will affect my credit when buying the new house.  I've been preapproved for much more than I'm going to spend on the new house by the relocation company's mortgage broker.

The 401k balance currently sits around $24k, so I figure I'd net about $14k. Combined with the signing bonus I'm receiving, this would pay off a huge portion of my high interest debt. New job matches up to 6% (same as old job) but also has a pension system.

The reduction in monthly payments by closing these accounts would be &gt;6% of my pay.  My plan would be to contribute 10% of my paycheck (4% more than I contribute now) to my 401k and using the remaining &gt;2% toward paying off the remaining consumer debt. I'm planning on working for another 25-30 years, so I realize the early withdrawal/penalty is going to be costly in the long run in terms of compounding my money, but I'm certainly not earning the 20+% interest that I'm paying on the debt!

I'm extremely confident I won't go back to my old spending habits. We were both haphazardly spending without actually looking at where our money was actually going.  Tracking every penny has been a rude awakening. We've both since developed much better spending habits (well, NOT spending habits), have been good about sticking to my budget though YNAB and I've closed all but one credit card account (one of the lower interest cards with good rewards). Spending my 401k and accruing the debt again simply WILL NOT happen.

I'm asking for advice because what has made financial sense to me in the past...hasn't exactly turned out to be sound financial decisions.  I've made a big turnaround in the past few months but still don't trust my gut instincts yet.  

P.S. If the answer is ""ABSOLUTELY NOT!"" on cashing out the 401k, some advice on what to do with it when I leave my current position would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance, pf.",finance,1388688623

I also have a loan from a car lease with about $10k (a little over 2 years left on lease)

Please understand that getting rid of my CC debt is my number 1 priority.  I had some dumb spending habits and made much less after graduating college.   My living expenses have been cut in half starting today as my girlfriend has moved in with me.  The extra money will be going towards paying off debt.

What I'd like to do is sign up for a card or two with signup bonuses to start accrue mileage.  With the information above, would a CC company more likely turn me down for a card?  I realize I may have a high interest rate, but as long as I pay off in full, that won't matter.",finance,1388698213
personalfinance,$300K in student loan debt-- help me come up with a budgeting plan please.,"I've posted on here before about my situation.

**Brief background:** Ivy league undergrad and Ivy league law school. Currently owe close to $300K in student loans when you take into account the interest that accrued while I was in school. Currently, employed and my salary is $150K (about $85K in NYC after taxes, insurance, etc.).


I'm currently enrolled in Income Based Repayment called IBR (since I made very little as a student in 2012 and 2013), so my payments are extremely low ($300 per month). However, I want to pay more than the IBR minimum obviously each month, which is why I'm here. Under IBR, the government pays the interest on my Stafford loans ($25K loan and a $65K stafford loan) so I don't really have to worry about interest on those for the next 2 years.

Let's say I plan to put $3100 towards loans each month (I'll increase this amount next year or later in the year). Based on the interest rates below, what is my best course of action? I know it's always best to attack those with the highest rates first, so how should I allocate funds for these loans:


**Grad PLUS (35K)- 8.25%**

Monthly Interest Charge: $250

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $470



**Grad PLUS (150K)- 7.65%**

Monthly Interest Charge: $1100

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $1920
 

**Stafford  (25K)- 6.55%**

(under IBR, interest rate is basically 0% for the next 2 years before going back to 6.55%)
Monthly Interest Charge: $130 

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $270

Monthly IBR minimum: $25

 
**Stafford (65K)- 6.55%**

(under IBR, interest rate is basically 0% for the next 2 years before going back to 6.55%)

Monthly Interest Charge: $350

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $770

Monthly IBR minimum: $70



Also, is there benefit to consolidating the Stafford loans since they have the same 6.55% interest rate and are both covered by IBR?

personalfinance,Please help me and give me advice.,"I need help and guidance of what to do next, I'm not even certain who to turn to for advice except for the conglomerate of people here in the hopes that someone can give me some advice. 

Some background information about me: I came from a chaotic abusive childhood all the way up until graduation. I was not taught monetary skills or life skills, I was not taught to budget, or how to survive in the adult world. When it came time for college, being an artist I was sucked into and pushed to join a for profit school; the art institute. I had no financial aid, I had zero support for help and I didn't even qualify for FAFSA because my father had not paid taxes one year and I was not yet 24 to claim independence. (Mother was out of the picture) Yet I was not advised to avoid joining a 85k program, in fact the school told me I would graduate minimum a 45k a year salary! Right out of college! (This was before the market crash of 2008) I was also told private school loans were no big deal, that I could consolidate and pay based on how much I made. I was also kicked out of my house right as I turned 19. I was only working part time and also had to use my school loans to survive and pay rent.

I was lied to repeatedly by my own finical aid ""counselors,"" as I was called in every so often for a new quarter to sign up for more money, it was always a high pressure situation, ""You'll be kicked out if you don't do this!"" I was told I could consolidate federal and private loans: False. I was told private loans had income based repayment plans: False (At least in my experience they refused) I was told I could do forbearance if I couldn't make payments: False! You have to be current on your school loans to qualify for hardship (which is another way of them saying, you're screwed, if you needed hardship forbearance and were current you wouldn't be experiencing hardship)

These are all the things I have learned thus far, and they might not even be accurate or true as they are from the bank source and researching. (Chase bank for example in the very beginning of paying back my school loans told me if I gave them my tax return, 1.8k, they would allow me to enter into hardship forbearance. I did, they took my money and then told me I had to be current and didn't allow me to have forbearance. )

I do take personal responsibility, I was over the age of 18 and I should have done the research, I should have learned what the consequences were for everything I was being rushed into signing and I didn't. In hindsight I don't know how I graduated throughout the abusive relationships and hardships I went through during that time, only my desire to be better than my upbringing and to use my talents to have a better life got me through. 


Chase is the issue once again at hand.  I had no way of making the required payments on my school loans. I went with the only option I thought I had, I allowed all of my school loans to default and go to collections, I then called and set up payments I could afford every month and hoped that I could save a lump sum to settle what I originally took out. (Interest has increased what I initially took out from 145k to around 200k)

I made around $150 a month payments to Chase debt collectors for almost two years (More than any of the others). Then a few months shy of a year ago I lost my job. I had to stop payments, move out of my apt, etc. and find new work. I did find new work but I am still being underpaid, roughly $22 an hour for 7 years of experience and a BA degree and a mountain of student debt.


Here's the part where I need guidance:

I called the debt collector who had my chase loans to reset up my payments. She told me they had been, ""Recalled,"" which I had never heard of and was unaware they would do as they supposedly had sold them to a debt collector. I called Chase and they told me that they were going to report my full school loan with them, 83k to the IRS and send me a 1099 form for my taxes. She said I can no longer make any payments to them, that they will send me the form and the only way I can pay them is to call and settle with them. They made me a generous settlement offer of 7.1k and 13.8k, but again I am a middle aged 20 year old with zero assets, no credit and no financial backers.


I don't fully understand what the consequences of this will be.. I don't know if I will now owe the IRS a ridiculously large amount of money this coming year or next, I don't know if what she told me was true or false.  I don't go on vacations. I don't buy expensive things, I buy my clothes at Goodwill. I don't own a fancy car. I have learned from my mistakes and escaped the pitfall cycles a bad childhood will bestow upon you, but I have to pay for my mistakes, but I don't fully know how.

Bitcoin,"Happy 4th Anniversary Bitcoin, lets give a political voice to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Bomb!","Our Federal Government’s political power is based on the ability to control money.  The ideals of freedom are based on the liberty of money and trade. Establishing a competing currency to the U.S. Dollar is a primary issues for individuals to regain the wealth of their production.  The fiat currencies of governments around the world have stolen decades of wealth from the people and it is time to phase out government fiat. To change the way things are done, the money power must be shifted to the people. Bitcoin allows individuals the liberty to bypass the control and destructiveness of government fiat currency.  With every transaction, vendor, and service that uses Bitcoin as a means of exchange in the Bitcoin economy, the end of government control over money becomes closer to a reality for those involved.

As a digital currency, Bitcoin brings a unique spin on an old idea of sound money.  There are several properties of money and Bitcoin fits them all well, but the value is clear to everyone exchanging Bitcoins; it is the money of the people. Each day Bitcoin becomes more and more legitimate in different sectors of the economy. The one sector that will put a damper on Bitcoin’s future growth is government.  Government will try to put regulations and barriers around the use of Bitcoins in the future, this is because it is a threat to government control over money. I purpose that Bitcoiners push early and often to break into the halls of government to show that Bitcoin and other competing currencies are not going anywhere.

I am currently running for State Senate in Nevada in the 2014 election cycle, and I want to do something completely unique and pioneering in the political process.   I intend on running a campaign heavily financed with Bitcoin contributions.   My goal is to have 80% of my funding to come from the Bitcoin economy and 20% from USD. I want to reinvest all Bitcoin contributions into the Bitcoin economy where and when I am able.  Putting Bitcoins back into print shops, contractors, web services, and whatever else is possible in the Bitcoin economy. This will grow the use of Bitcoin and new vendors will push to enter the market.  It is vital that Bitcoiners show that they are politically active and involved in setting policy.  Soon after my campaign has a successful outcome with the use of Bitcoin, more political types will start to listen and follow our lead.  I predict that Bitcoin will establish leverage in the political process very quickly.

I am organizing my campaign to conduct a Bitcoin Bomb on January 3rd, 2014 and beyond, which is the forth anniversary of the founding of Bitcoin.  Every fraction of a Bitcoin donated to my campaign will bring more and more attention to Bitcoin as a viable and usable currency by the people for all things. My campaign budget for victory in my primary against an establishment Republican is $175,000 USD or around ฿ 213 BTC at $823 per BTC.  With our 80% goal of BTC funding, at the current exchange rate it is around ฿170 BTC that we want to raise from the Bitcoin Economy to promote, bring awareness to Bitcoin, and elect a pro-Bitcoin candidate to state office in Nevada and give the Bitcoin economy a political voice.

personalfinance,How much did your house REALLY cost?,"My wife and I are preparing to buy our first home. We both have solid jobs, we don't have any debt with outrageous balances or interest rates, and we have a $12k emergency fund saved up.

We live in Upstate NY and plan on spending between $175-$220k on our first home, which is reasonable for the area. We'll be putting 20% down to get the best rates and best peace of mind longterm.

I'm trying the best I can to prepare for any financial scenario that may come up in the buying process. My question is this: when you bought your home, how much did you really have to spend? Beyond the 20% down? I know I'll have to pay closing costs -- but I can't seem to find a straight answer on how much those typically are (I've read everything from 3% to $10k).

personalfinance,Can someone please clarify an issue I have regarding my student loans?,"Hi,

I've recently subscribed to r/personalfinance and I'm really learning a lot.  So, thanks for that!  The question I have for this post is in regard to the interest rate and how much money from each payment is being applied to the interest, and how much is being applied to the principal.

For reference, I'm 27, have about $14,000 (6%) in student loans, just started a new job and made just north of $60,000 this year.  About a year ago, through my bank's online bill pay, I setup automatic monthly payments for my loan and figured it would take care of itself over time.  Tonight, I decided to take a look at the progress I'd made and was more than a little appalled by what I saw.  

Despite the fact that the loan's interest is at 6% my monthly payments of about $225 are being applied to the loan in a roughly 65% principal / 35% interest ratio!!!

Am I just totally missing the boat on how interest works?  Would a larger monthly payment have a higher percentage applied toward the principal? 

And the real question on my mind:
I work in sales and have a very unsteady income.  Should I use the majority of the $4,000 I have saved up on beating this loan?

Thanks so much for any advice.",finance,1388707970

personalfinance,I'm moving in 10 months and wondering if I should sell my Jeep or take it with me.,"I need some advice because I am not sure what route to take. I have a 2002 Jeep Liberty with about 92k miles. I currently owe $5,580 on it and its worth about $5500. The interest rate on the loan is 4.24%. In October I will be moving to Atlanta and I don't see the need for a 4x4 vehicle over there. Also it gets pretty poor gas milage, about 14-15 mpg.

Anyway, the options I am considering are:

1. Pay the car off and take it with me and just driving it until it turns to rust(hopefully 200k+ miles).

2. Selling it and buying a better more fuel efficient car in Atlanta.

3. Take it with me and drive it in Atlanta until I find a new(used) car to replace it.

 As of now the Jeep is in good condition and is not giving me any issues. The cost of ownership so far has been low except for the gas.

Looking at these rates and assuming the 401(k) performs similar in 2014 as it did in 2013, if option 1 is to put $X more in my 401(k) and option 2 is to put $X towards my mortgage instead, option 2 would net (23-5)% more than option 1, correct? Obviously I wouldn't be able to touch it until I retire, but as long as I'm okay with that, I can expect an extra 18% if I put it in the 401(k) and just make the minimum payments on my mortgage? It sounds strange that keeping the mortgage debt longer would make more sense financially than paying it off.

personalfinance,Need Advice on Building Credit and Loans Straight Out of College (USA),"Hi r/personalfinance, 

I don't frequent here very often but I have seen you guys mentioned many times by r/frugal (which I do frequent), and I figured there is no one else better to ask a question about credit cards and loans other than you! 

A bit of a background: I am currently a senior in college who is due to graduate in June. I have never had a credit card and due to some things that happened in the past, my family and I are currently not in close contact. I used to attend college with my mother's help but because of what happened I have had to get a loan through someone I know to finish my final year of school. Luckily, it's only one year of college so there's not that much I would have to pay off. 

The loan interest rate is at 4%, which is a lot lower than if I had to get a loan through banks or private institutions/providers (which can be anywhere between 6-11%). And yes, I can only get a private loan since I do not qualify for anything else. 

I know having a good credit is very important out in the real world, but I am glad that I have no credit rather than having bad/terrible credit. I have been thinking a lot about what to do about the no-credit-issue since graduation is slowly creeping upon me.

SO, here's my question: would it be smart of me to finish paying off my loan FIRST and THEN apply for a credit card? Or would it be alright if I apply for a credit card for but keep a tight rein on it in terms of the spending? Also, any suggestions on what kind/type of credit card to apply for for someone like me who has never applied for a credit card and who has no credit at all? 

Of course, all this would only be followed through if I am able to find some sort of job straight out of college (we all know how difficult that is). But, just in case I do, I'd like to have the knowledge/information beforehand.

Sorry for the lengthy post, and if anything doesn't make sense or need further explanation please don't hesitate to let me know!

personalfinance,Starting a portfolio with more money than experience,"Let me give the details of my situation.

I'll be graduating in May 2014, accepting a job in the ~50k/yr range (not given specifics).

I have no debt, $73k in a savings account, and will receive an additional $10k in stipend (scholarship) by my graduation. I will have just turned 21 when I graduate. Also of note is I have a low risk tolerance (rooted in a dislike of uncertainty and general lack of financial/stock market expertise)

I visited my parents financial adviser and was generally unsatisfied with his advice. He recommended an actively managed mutual fund with a 1% expense ratio and a 4.5% load, managed by a company affiliated with his own.
 
I decided if I could not trust a family friend, I probably couldn't trust anyone, so here I am for my DIY investing. I've read a lot of material here, and on the Bogleheads wiki and I generally subscribe to all the philosophies. I only have a few specific questions:

What should be my investment vehicle priority? As my emergency fund is obviously taken care of, I can open a Roth IRA now and contribute the $5.5k. For FY14 I will then contribute up to my employer match in a Traditional 401(k), and $5.5k to the Roth IRA. Following this, what do I do? I presume I want to manage short term investing by simply opening a taxable investing account, correct? Or should I completely forgo short term investing and haul it all away to the 401(k), rebalancing in favor of short-term investing later in my career if I feel the need?

Further, although the financial adviser had nothing good to say about Vanguard, I tend to like it a lot. Should I pick one of the LifeStrategy funds or attempt to manage my own portfolio? I like the 60/40 stocks/bonds fund, but I think I would prefer a little higher percentage of international stocks to US.

Also, the (very successful) financial adviser cautioned against buying bonds right now, citing that interest rates are on a rise, breaking a long-standing downward trend.

Any advice would be great. Here's what I'm currently leaning toward:

1) 15k Emergency Fund

2) 5.5k Roth FY13

3) Up to 401(k) Employer match

4) 5.5k Roth FY14

5) The remaining of the 73k into taxable investment account (I can grab this at any time...right? That sounds safe.)

With all investments going into Vanguard's LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund until I get a better grasp on the stock market.

Thought? I'd love any and all input. Very very insecure about my decision making here.

EDIT: Also, my monthly expenditures (without any big purchases) are around $1000. Could be less if I was in an emergency, so my emergency fund is super generous.

As far as short term purchases, my next car in about 12 years, a used motorcycle (~$3000) in the next year, and the earliest I would buy a house would be in 5 years. Nothing else I can think of.

Bitcoin,Asked my friend biggest questions for bitcoin and this was his response.,"I'm sure this has been debated much throughout this reddit but I'll send it in anyways.  Heres what he said:

""1. Its a deflationary currency. The supply of bitcoin is capped. It will appreciate tremendously if the system ever gains more than marginal acceptance. The only outlet for growth in a bitcoin economy is for the currency itself to appreciate. If there's deflation in USD, the federal reserve can increase the number of dollars in circulation. The problem is that if people expect deflation they will hoard the currency instead of spending it.
2. There are two characteristics money should have to be successful: a medium of exchange, and a reasonably stable store of value. I think it's completely unclear how bitcoin should be a stable store of value. For example, underpinning the value of gold is that if all else fails you can use it to make pretty things. Underpinning the value of the dollar is a combination of the fact that you can use them to pay ur taxes to the US government, and that the federal reserve has promised to buy them back if their real value begins to sink at (like 2%+ deflation per year). Bitcoin people always talk about how it's a great medium of exchange but can't seem to explain why bitcoin is a reliable store of value.""

economy,"China's FDI is set for a comeback, after months in the dolddrums","International investors, after wrestling with economic woes at home, have regained their appetite
In the middle of every month the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, Shen Danyang, addresses a news briefing at which he announces the foreign direct investment figures.
After the announcement, one of his signature remarks is along these lines: the drop in China's FDI is temporary and will eventually rebound.
He has said that since November 2011, when FDI fell, on a yearly basis, for the first time since the end of the 2008-09 financial crisis.
In fact, China's FDI continued its losing streak in the 12 months to the end of November in 2012, except for negligible growth of 0.05 percent in May.
So it seems that Shen has had to eat his words for more than a year. But hopefully not for much longer, because China's lure as a world top investment destination is showing signs of recovery.
First, the recovery of economic growth in the world's second-largest economy will renew global investors' confidence in the market.
Economic indicators published over the past two months have confirmed that recovery is on the horizon. Clearly, the Chinese economy is emerging from its three-year trough and is beginning to gain solid footing once again.
The recovery is sustainable because it was achieved without the government introducing huge stimulus on big projects or support for the export sector.
As economic growth recovers, new opportunities will present themselves, and international capital will no doubt flow back to China. 
Second, some overseas investors who parked their money at home as they wrestled with domestic economic problems have gradually regained an interest in international investment as their businesses have ridden out the storms that have buffeted them.
Among them are investors in the United States. The worst for the US economy is essentially over, especially now that the so-called fiscal cliff has been averted. In addition, US investors, with the country's ultra-low interest rate and loose monetary policy, have not exactly been short of capital. But they have been hamstrung by a loss of confidence, having nowhere to invest their money as the economy has ailed.
Now, as the US economy gains momentum, these investors will have regained their confidence in investing, whether it be at home or abroad. The fact that US investment in China has grown over the past few months is the best evidence of that trend.
Third, the foreign exchange advantages that China has offered are becoming clear as its currency renews its trend of appreciation. That trend stalled as the Chinese economy struggled in the second and third quarters.
But the currency has begun to appreciate again in the past few months, widening the foreign exchange profit margin. Coupled with the fact that China's interest rate is far higher than those in many other countries, the lure of investing in China again becomes all the more apparent, especially for short-term speculative investors.
Finally, a group of big Hong Kong investors has large plans to invest in the Chinese mainland over the coming months.
Hong Kong is the Chinese mainland's largest FDI source, accounting for 60 percent of it. This is because many international investors invest in the mainland through their Hong Kong subsidiaries. The Hong Kong branches of mainland-based companies account for a great many of them.
This group of companies, many of them subsidiaries of state-owned mainland conglomerates, will invest in the mainland more aggressively in the coming year now thatChinahas completed its leadership transition.
These companies tend to be conservative with expansion plans before any major leadership transition. This is understandable as a transition will usher in changes in policies and leadership style, even if those changes are minor. State companies, used to following policies drawn up by the top leadership, do not invest heavily when policy changes are taking place.
But they will surely be keen to renew their expansion plans now that the transition is done and after new policy orientation is hammered out. That will result in a spree of investment from Hong Kong to the mainland.
In all, 2013 will be a good year for China's FDI, but of course it will not all be plain sailing.
China's slow progress in market opening, partly in response to rising global protectionism against it, will dampen the confidence of a few international investors.
In addition, efforts by developed economies to lure back investment will result in the loss of FDI into China.
But as the positives outweigh the negatives, Shen of the Ministry of Commerce should be able to tell the monthly news briefing in the coming fortnight: ""You see, China's FDI is on its way back. I told you so.""   ---http://www.abcsources.com/",finance,1388739293
personalfinance,Have a lot of student loan debt and need help deciding what to do regarding my major,"[Current Debt](http://i.imgur.com/tVoXTdW.jpg)

I am currently going to a 6 year pharmacy school. I did ok in the first two years of pre-pharm. The first professional year (PY1) started off alright enough but I had trouble adjusting and didn't really learn how to seriously study (at least what worked for me) until the very end of the first semester. At the beginning of the second semester of PY1, I was doing ok but work took up more time than I thought it would and I found myself falling behind. Eventually I ended up quitting but my quit date was not until directly before finals and quitting left me feeling unmotivated and defeated and my grades suffered as a result. 

PY2 semester 1 began and I went in determined to do well and I did initially. PY2 in my program throws the hardest courses in the entire curriculum at you. You start off with no exams for the first few weeks and after that period is over, you are hit with multiple tests (1 to at most 3) every week until a break for thanksgiving and then you jump into finals the week after returning. Every final is cumulative and while only 1 class's individual tests are cumulative, you must have a good understanding of the material covered previously as well as PY1 in order to do well. I started off well enough, acing 3 of the first round of exams, doing poorly on one C (although that was the class average) and getting a C+ on the exam that the majority of the class failed. After this I cut back a bit from my strenuous and constant studying which set me up for trouble for round two of exams. I resumed my old study methods for round three but the pace at which the classes move and the accumulation of material caused me not to do as well. I fell back into that habit of not studying as strenuously during break which really hurt me for finals. 

My professional GPA (from PY1 and 2) dropped from required minimum 2.7 to a 2.61 which means I will be on probation this upcoming semester. I'm not sure whether I should stick with this program (if I can handle the workload, which I could this semester if I didn't cut back from studying but I'm not sure exactly how well I would have to do in each class to not be kicked out of the program this upcoming semester, **which is the hardest semester in the entire 6 year program and quite a bit harder than the previous**) or If I should switch to nursing.

This would bring up another problem, nursing school here is quite expensive and I am almost at my limit for federal loans. I feel terrible for putting my parents in the position with their loans taken out for me and while they would take out more for nursing, I don't want to put them into more debt. They don't make much and this is a heavy load for them. Also, none of my credits would transfer to the nursing program (which is bullshit but it's the policy for some reason), despite the courses I took the first two years being mostly the same as what nursing majors would take. My debt is all in federal (non-private) loans thankfully and I would prefer to keep it that way in order to take advantage of the federal programs that exist for nurses to pay off loans. 

I'm not sure if I should stick with pharmacy or switch to nursing. I'm not sure if I should remain at this expensive private school or attempt to transfer to a cheaper public school and if I would even be accepted due to my poor professional GPA and just decent non-professional GPA. Could I apply with only my high school transcripts? Am I eligible for more federal loans if I switch? I'm aware of the 30k cap but is it on a per major/school basis (allowing my to take out enough to cover nursing at the cheaper public school) or is it overall?",finance,1388741295
stocks,The Fed has Created Yet Another U.S. Stock Market Bubble,,finance,1388743839
Bitcoin,Dear Mr. President,"Dear President Obama,   
   
I am writing you because I am deeply concerned that Bitcoin and alt-currencies are a threat to our national security, and I am providing the agencies with a potential solution in case outlawing anonymous crypto-currency transactions or attempting to regulate the internet do not work.    
   
First, allow me to express why I do not believe Bitcoin is in a destined-to-pop bubble.  The tulip, baseball card, and beanie baby-like bubbles collapsed when the buyers realized that the suppliers had begun flooding the market and could continue to do so without limit.  It became pointless to collect those things.  That won't happen with Bitcoin unless you intervene.  How are people going to make the oversupply connection with Bitcoin when we cannot point to any suppliers beyond an algorithm?     
     
Meanwhile, the backers will echo the message that the rate of supply and maximum number of units are fixed.. only adding an extra layer of smokescreen to the layman's confusion.  And, why would the rate of demand fall anytime soon if ""investment"" in bitcoins leads to year-over-year gains of 1000% or more? Exactly who benefits if Bitcoin values decrease?  Miners? No. Investors? No. Sellers? No. Merchants? No. The US Government and the US Dollar? Yes.  And let's say that diminishing returns set in for investors.  If by that time people around the globe have become convinced by emerging merchant services, like SnapCard, that Bitcoin is a store of value.. then IT IS a store of value and there is no longer a speculative bubble to be burst.  
     
The case for Bitcoin's valuation will only grow as Silicon Valley, India, and Russia build value-adding applications atop the open-source platform.. Do you really think that national banks can compete with that pace of innovation?   
    
As a consumer and investor, I see Bitcoin as an opportunity to pay off my school debt, car debt, credit card debt, and all the debt I am strapped with because I followed the way of our society (which sadly, your laws and regulations exacerbate).  When it works for me, I'm going to post it to Reddit and tell my friends to do the same.  As a good friend, I would advise them to dollar-cost-average and diversify into other promising crypto-currencies.     
    
Therein lies the most concerning security threat.. We aren't going to know who has created new crypto-currencies and mined the first 20+% of them.. Was it Russia, Kim Jong-Un, or terrorists?  All they have to do is pump crypto-returns into news stories like the Bitcoin early-adopters have.     
     
Undoubtedly, the NSA and Homeland security can use forensic accounting to figure out who owns the current stashes of Bitcoins (I hope they already have).. but can they continue to keep track of digital currency owners as these currencies divide down into lower decimal places, new owners come on board, and alt-currencies begin to flourish?  What if the cute and fun ""Dogecoin"" is a Russian Trojan horse?    
    
I don't know, and I don't want to find out.   
     
Solution:  I propose that the US joins the crypto-currency competition by creating US government crypto.  Certainly the number of pro-government citizens in the US outweighs the number of anti-government types that participate in Bitcoin, so we (the US) would have a much faster adoption rate if the US can launch its crypto-currency ASAP.  The US government could promise stronger encryption, safer accounts, more consumer protections and support, less money laundering risk, and traceable transactions.  The IRS might even be able to devise and implement an automatic tax calculator for tracking sales and income taxes.  The best part is that you can pledge the first 10 million units (of however many units you decide to create) to the US debt, thereby convincing the citizens that our use of the US digital currency will benefit them more than any shady, potentially terrorist-created, crypto-currency out there.  Consider me the first in line to buy your digital currency (The Federal ""Stars"").    

You could also consider giving Stars to each citizen and allow them to be released for approved expenditures (education, down payment on house, etc.).

It may seem as though I am suggesting uncontrollable deflation and some (minimal) redistribution of wealth.. and maybe I am.  Maybe I'm starting to think that crypto-currencies are our way out of debt-inducing materialism, and into the augmented reality (AR) promised land.   
    
Please bear with me as I explain this:   
     
For example, I believe I could comfortably survive if I just had an earth-suit for shelter (climate controlled, weather protected, long-term battery power, etc.), an augmented reality helmet for work and entertainment (Google glass encased in a custom fit, 3d-printed, sound-proofed helmet.. w/ interchangeable parts to swap in and out of different hardware),  a refillable supply of great tasting and nutritious cereal, and a camel-back for water.  

As augmented reality ramps up in the next 15-25 years, I expect to also be able to wear gloves that limit my full arm mobility to recognize AR objects.  For instance, if I go to pick up a box, the arm-wear should restrict where I can place my hands (not beyond the box's surface), and the armor should add resistance to my movement when I go to pick up that box (imitating weight).  I should essentially look like a mime as I explore the world that designers and developers have created for me (by cashing in their deflationary currency to invest in projects), and requiring less and less resources (beyond time) to do their jobs.  

I might look silly to non-adapters, but they would look silly to me: putting on makeup, dressing up in random flimsy clothing, mowing lawns to pretend they still own farms, and doing all that other non-sensical stuff of yester-year. 
     
The difference is that I would be anonymous to them, whereas I would see their face.. and be able to know too much about them for them to not adapt (because of facial recognition).
   
To make the conversion to this AR realm, we need a digital currency.  We don't need to convert from fiat into crypto overnight, but we just cannot let some anti-government criminals beat the United States to the punch.     
    
Some people who are spreading the word about Bitcoin are saying that it's for freedom from the government.  These people take everything that you do for us for granted and seem to think we should be living in a country of gangs and anonymous crime.  Perhaps we can have a national awareness month for what it's like to live in a warring African tribe or living among real thugs.

personalfinance,Income tax effects,"Staff could possibly make additions on the 401(k) using a pre-tax or perhaps post-tax basis, dependent upon the plan allows for. Along with frequently pre-tax or perhaps after-tax input, earnings out of investments in a very 401(k) account (in the form of interest, dividends, or possibly investment capital increases) usually are tax-deferred. Typically the resulting compounding interest together with past due taxes is often a big benefit from the particular 401(k) plan any time organized more than extended periods of time. Starting in the 2006 tax yr, personnel may tend to designate contributions to provide a Roth 401(k) deductions. Just like the terms of an Roth IRA these kind of efforts are fashioned upon an after-tax time frame and everything earnings regarding these kinds of money besides are tax-deferred but will end up being tax-free when an experienced submission. Though the plan, sponsor has to fix the plan to build the choices.
With regard to pre-tax contributions, employees doesn't pay for federal income tax about the amount of today's salary she or he defers to a 401(k) account. For instance, a what person usually generates $50,000 in a very particular yr and also defers $3,thousand to a 401(k) account that will yr just recognizes $47,Thousand for income with that year's tax return. At the moment this will characterize a near term $750 benefits throughout taxes for just a particular employee, if it turns out the worker continued inside the 25% marginal income tax bracket where there weren't any various other modifications (e.g., breaks). The employee at some point pays income taxes within the dollars while or perhaps this lady withdraws any capital, ordinarily for the duration of pension. There for any acquires (such as tax-favored funds gains) are usually transformed into ""ordinary profits"" at the moment this money is actually withdrawn.
In case the personnel produced after-tax contributions towards non-Roth 401(k) account, these kinds of amounts will be commingled with all the pre-tax capital and merely add to the non-Roth 401(k) basis. Whenever distributions are made this after tax part of the distribution are going to be calculated as the proportion in the non-Roth contributions towards the complete 401(k) basis. The rest of the distribution is tax-free without having to included in income for the yr.
For accumulated after-tax contributions in addition to cash gains in a specified Roth account (Roth 401(k)), ""certified distributions"" can be made tax-free. For you to are eligible, distributions need to be developed more than Five-years following on from the first designated Roth contributions and never until the calendar year the place that the account proprietor gets age Fifty nine?, only if any exception can be applied when detailed in IRS code sections Seventy two(t). When it comes to designated Roth contributions, any contributions staying produced upon an after-tax basis is the reason why your after tax income that year of contribution isn't decreased which is with the help of pre-tax contributions. Roth contributions usually are permanent and should not become changed into pre-tax contributions later on. Administratively, Roth contributions must be created to an independent account, along with records data has to be held that will differentiate the amount of contribution and also the related earnings which are to acquire Roth treatment.
Contrary to the Roth IRA, there is absolutely no upper income limitation capping qualification intended for Roth 401(k) contributions. People that end up disqualified from your Roth IRA may well contribute to his / her Roth 401(k). Individuals that entitled to both equally can easily contribute the maximum statutory numbers towards both equally plans (including equally catch-up contributions if applicable).",finance,1388769617

- Do bond FUNDS react differently than the general bond market?  (Active and indexed)

I am also curious about VWAHX (muni-bond), which remained constant all last week while other funds dropped.

- Hypothetically rates go up 2% in a day.  The NAVs would drop instantly, but how long would it take for those fund's yields to increase 2% and begin the slow healing process for an investor?

Bitcoin,"Friday Fun: Pot, Porn &amp; Bitcoin","It’s Friday of a short week.  Want to talk about pot and porn?  So do I.  

Regardless of your personal values, marijuana and pornography are now massive legal industries in the United States. On January 1st, dispensaries in Colorado began selling marijuana legally to recreational users.  Over 20 additional states have at least decriminalized pot if not legalized it for medicinal purposes. Almost immediately redditors began clamoring to use Bitcoin at dispensaries. Not to be outdone, the porn industry made its first first foray into bitcoin when Porn.com (and all of its affiliates as one expert redditor pointed out) announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin for its monthly premium subscriptions.  

Bitcoin could be a godsend (satansend?) for these industries.  

When it comes to weed, it is still against federal law to possess and distribute the drug.  With the delicate balancing act that exists between federal restrictions and state blessings, dispensaries are bound to be extremely cautious about their sales.  Already there were rumors that Colorado shops were refusing credit and debit card payments.  Today, marijuana is a cash only business.  So how about digital cash?  It makes perfect sense for dispensaries (and dealers) to accept bitcoin due to the anonymized nature of the transactions, and the real-time settlement options.  Moreover, in a closely scrutinized industry, these merchants could at least create a better digital paper trail to assist with their sales and income tax reporting.   

On the other hand, porn accounts for approximately 1 in 8 websites and up to 30% of all web traffic.  And yet the business of porn has struggled.  (Links are safe for work.)  Many think the major issue confronting the adult industry has been piracy and the widespread availability of “free” porn.  But an equally problematic issue is the proliferation of fraud and credit card scams, not to mention privacy concerns.  Bitcoin could address those issues and become a financial Viagra for the industry.  I actually met not one, but two, producers in the adult industry who attended the Inside Bitcoins conference.  Aside from being the middle-aged, pot-bellied ruffians I had fully expected to produce adult movies, they were savvy about the business side of things and downright gleeful about Bitcoin’s potential in porn.  

Both industries could use merchant tools like Coinbase’s and BitPay’s, but those companies are batting away customers left and right and not likely to touch anything which would attract additional regulatory headaches.  But tools like BitPay’s real-time currency conversion could help streamline tax accounting for dispensaries.  And paywall solutions like BitMonet's seem custom made for industries like porn. 

The result is likely to be one or more bitcoin startups that focus near exclusively on these and other gray market merchants.  Some will call them Silk Road Lites, but expect them to be major money makers, probably soon.

I posted here about 5-6 months ago to get your advice on buying a home (long story short: can't afford it. thanks!), and my debt (i think i posted here about that, anyway).

I have $1,000 in credit card debt (down from $5,000) that will be paid off on 1/24/2014.  After the credit card debt, I plan to do snowball payments on both student loan and my car loans.  Many of my student loans are at 6.8% fixed interest, so I will snowball those first since they are at the highest interest rate.

I was getting everything in order, and realized I may qualify for a better interest rate on my car loan.  I have some questions that I will outline below

Owed: $12,343.80
Current: 2.99% APR
Likely approved: 1.99% APR

I have 3 more years if I pay the minimum payment every month.  Since I will be paying all additional funds towards student loans at this time, I will likely NOT pay much more than minimum here (I usually round up to to nearest hundred every month, but that's not much extra!).

My questions are:
1. Is it worth it to apply for a loan with only 1% lower interest?
2. Will the application/approval for this new loan affect my credit score?  (I'm currently in the low end of the ""excellent"" range)
3. Would you advise on staying away from the online only banks that we have likely never heard of before?  (I have had a few suggestions using Credit Karma for banks or institutions I have never heard of before, is there anything wrong with these?)

Thanks again for all your help. :)  

PS- I know some of you might take the Dave Ramsey approach and say ""sell your car!  don't have a loan until you pay off your debt!,"" and while I think that is a great solution for some people - it doesn't make sense in my situation for many reasons. I  have given it serious thought, though.",finance,1388781301

If you have a contradictory opinion, please share it.  We would all benefit from an educated discussion of this issue.   

Keep in mind this post is intended for a layman audience.  If you are a tax professional or want a detailed examination of this topic, you find this post lacking.  Please don't nit pick this post with technicalities or narrow exceptions, I purposely excluded such nuances for the sake of readability. 

I should note that this post does not address aggressive tax planning strategies.   Such strategies are a lot of fun to discuss, but they do not belong in this type of post.  If you are interested in such strategies, perhaps we can make a follow-up post on another day.

**Topic 1: Realization**
***********************************

**#1: Are gains on Bitcoins taxable?**  
Yes.   This is one of the only unequivocal answers you'll find in this post.   All income is taxable, regardless of source or form, unless the Internal Revenue Code specifically states otherwise.  Bitcoins present a lot of interesting tax questions, but whether gains are taxable is not one of them.    


**#2: When do my gains become taxable?***

Gains are taxable in the year they are realized.  Realization occurs when you exchange bitcoins for any type of other property; such as cash, merchandise, or services.    This includes everything from haircuts to yachts.  Essentially, any transaction involving Bitcoin is a realization event and triggers taxable gain.  *Note:  IRS Notice 2014-21 expressly confirms this treatment.*
 
Because I've seen a lot of misinformation on this point, I want to make myself perfectly clear.  If you own bitcoins that have appreciated in value, you cannot use them to purchase goods or services without realizing gain.   Such a purchase is an accession to wealth.  It puts you in the same position as if you had first sold the bitcoins for cash and then used the proceeds to purchase the goods or services directly.  Yet, one would be a taxable transaction while the other would not?  The IRS would never tolerate such a blatant loophole, and neither would the courts.   In fact, this exact argument has already been rejected for other types of assets.  The outcome for bitcoins will be the same.
 
Unfortunately, this has some serious implications for the future of bitcoin.  I have to question the effectiveness of bitcoin as a medium of exchange when the user has to calculate his or her tax liability on every single  transaction.  As the saying goes, the power to tax is the power to destroy, and this is no exception.    
 
*Note:  There is a code section that might provide some relief here, but only if bitcoins are categorized as a foreign currency.  Under this code section, the use of bitcoin to buy goods and services would be tax free as long as the transaction was personal (i.e. not for business or investment) and did not generate more than $200 of gain.  Unfortunately, the IRS ruled in Notice 2014-21 that bitcoin is not a currency for tax purposes.  So, this code section is inapplicable unless the IRS changes its position sometime in the future.*


**#3:  What if I sell my bitcoins but do not withdraw the proceeds from the exchange?** 

It doesn't matter, your gains were realized the moment you sold them.  It is irrelevant whether the proceeds from the sale are kept in your bank account or your exchange account, you still have a realized gain for tax purposes.

**#4:  What if I exchange my bitcoins for altcoins?** 

This is a fair question and implicates what is known as a ""like kind exchange.""  Like kind exchanges do not trigger realization, and therefore are tax-free.  Although it's technically possible for bitcoins and altcoins to qualify for-like kind treatment,  I think it's exceedingly unlikely.  The regulations for like kind exchanges require the two property types to have the same rights, characteristics, and obligations.    Whether altcoins and bitcoins meet this test is uncertain, but I would tend to think not.  ~~Additionally, if characterized as a foreign currency, bitcoins would be automatically barred from like-kind treatment anyways.  Thus, there are two significant legal hurdles that must be overcome before bitcoin and altcoins can qualify as for like-kind status.~~  Although nothing is for certain when it comes to bitcoins, I'm fairly confident that like-kind treatment will fail at one or both of these hurdles.  Thus, I would not suggest that you try to qualify such a transaction as a like kind exchange until further guidance on this issue is given by the IRS. 

*edit:  IRS Notice 2014-21 concluded that bitcoins are not a foreign currency, therefore it is possible that bitcoin can qualify for like-kind treatment if the ""rights and characteristics"" test is met.* 

**#5: So how can I avoid realizing gains on my bitcoins?** 

The only way to avoid realization is to hold your bitcoins without selling or exchanging them.  If you were hoping for a different answer, I'm sorry.  Whether you decide to actually report you realized gains is of course a different matter, but as far as the law is concerned, you have realized gains upon any sale or exchange of your bitcoins.

**#6: How does the IRS know about my gains?** *

The IRS only knows what it is told.  This means that it has no knowledge of your bitcoin transactions unless someone tells them.  Here are four way that can happen (others may exist).  
 
First, your bitcoin exchange or payment processor may report your transactions to the IRS.  This would be done with a Form 1099, which you’ve probably encountered at one time or another in a different context.   However, it does not appear that bitcoin transactions are currently subject to the 1099 reporting requirements (although that will probably change).   Thus, unless they voluntarily file a 1099 against you, it is unlikely that the IRS will receive a report of your bitcoin transactions.  Note that they would need your social security number to file a 1099 in your name.  *Edit:  IRS Notice 2014-21 clarifies that ""payment settlors"" who convert bitcoin payments to cash for merchants will have to file 1099s.  IF you are not a merchant, than this does not impact you.* 
 
Second, your bank or bitcoin exchange might file a Suspicious Activity Report (""SAR"").   US banks and bitcoin exchanges are required to file SARs for wire transfers that are “suspicious” and larger than $5,000 ($2,000 in the case of bitcoin exchanges).   The meaning of “suspicious” is very vague and highly discretionary.  Out of an abundance of caution, many banks automatically treat all international transfer as “suspicious.”  So, if you’ve sent or received a wire transfer of more than $5,000 to/from an international bitcoin exchange like Mt. Gox or BTC-e, you can be pretty sure that your bank has already filed a SAR against you (although they are prohibited from telling you if they did, so you'll never know for sure).   The larger and/or more frequent you SAR filings, the more likely they will become a legitimate red flag and trigger an investigation.  Although FinCEN is generally concerned with money laundering activities, the IRS does have access to FinCEN filings and it is common for IRS special agents to participate in FinCEN investigations.

Third, someone can rat you out to the IRS, which happens far more often than you might think.   The simple fact is that people get jealous, and if they've heard that you've made lots of tax free money with bitcoin, they might get tempted to make sure justice is served.  There's also that nice reward the IRS will pay them for snitching.  
 
Fourth, you voluntarily and accurately report your gains on your tax return.   That might sound ridiculous to some people given the inherent anonymity of bitcoin, but there are some very rich people in prison right now who used to think the same thing about their Swiss bank accounts.  The fact is that penalties for failing to report income are significant.  This includes the possibility of criminal prosecution.   You can also add to this the additional penalties for failing to report foreign financial accounts (discussed below), which can be even more severe. 
 
At the end of the day, you have a decision to make.  You can comply with the law and pay taxes just like everyone else, which is admittedly unpleasant.  Alternatively, you can violate the law and hope that you don't get caught.  Maybe you will, maybe you won't.  If you are caught, though, the amount of money you'll be forced to pay in penalties and interest will drastically exceed the amount you saved.  That's not to mention the possibility of a felony criminal conviction and a prolonged stay at Club Fed.   Personally, I have seen the havoc wreaked on people's lives by tax crimes and I would never want to be in their shoes.  Neither should you.    

**TL; DR:** Gains on bitcoins are taxable income.  They become taxable when you sell bitcoins for cash or exchange them for goods or services. The IRS does not receive any direct information regarding your bitcoin transactions, but it has other ways of finding out.  The monetary and criminal penalties for failing to report gains are not worth the taxes you'd save.

Bitcoin,A typical person in Bitcoin Doesn't WANT the Wall St Vultures in Bitcoin or Bitcoin businesses,"here is why.

1. they are savvy and awake to the games of wall st manipulation whether weekly options, fake etf's like slv/gld that capture premium from people vs the underlying, the endless derivatives BS being gamed

2. they realize a new paradigm cannot be created from the consciousness that created the old. Einstein said you cannot solve a problem from the same consciousness that created it.

3. Wall St destroys anything good in the end with constant focus on profit and greed to the extreme. They rig everything basically and that has been confirmed 100s of times including several world class articles by Matt Taibii let alone 100s of articles up on zero hedge.com , market-ticker.org etc

4. Wall St is in BED with the government.  They and the bankers and the largest corporations all work to maintain their monopolies and parasitical sucking of the 0% rate TIT of the FED

I could go on and on....but the last thing bitcoin needs is people creating more derivatives, or leverages, or monetizations of bitcoin

if they want to create real businesses, FINE, go ahead..but honestly, all one needs to do is accept bitcoin and you are already IN

if Wall St wants to do good they will figure out how bitcoin can Bankrupt or render USELESS law firms, trusts, the stock market/DTC ( patrick byrne nailed that one with naked shorting) , etc to USHER in real transparency and change. and to do it in a way that the end users always maintain control and as much ANON ability that they can. I 

until i see that I will continue to point out that these creeps have little ethics in the end. What are the chances they will go after their lawyer brothers charging ridiculous fees? What are the chances they will work with the government to remove privacy features with this programmable crypto currency in the end and move towards completely trackable currencies?  LOL. we know them and what they do. we know about the NSA, backdoors, overt lying by wall st and corporations, the patent stealing and blackmailing available via NSA tech networks. etc, etc

dogecoin,The biggest threat to Dogecoin,"Hey Shibes,

We all love dogecoin and want to see it go to the moon. But I think over the past few days, I've seen a shift in perception that threatens to kill dogecoin.

When we were the first ""joke digital currency"" we were getting a lot of attention because of the price spike, and because people were finding it a fun and easy alternative to bitcoin. The reddit community grew, and with the addition of the tipbot, we were in a pretty good position. The power of dogecoin is the strong community around the coin, and the sense of fun we all have.

The problem is that the influx of new ""joke coins"" like fedora coin, catcoin, and ""conye"" the kanye themed coin, is threatening to overrun us. Right now, the general public doesn't know much about dogecoin except that we're a coin based on a meme. They don't know the market cap, the huge community, etc. As the news keeps covering the huge new influx of joke coins, it's possible that we will be lumped in the same category with all the other crappy knockoff coins. It's a huge threat we are facing right now, I'm sorry to say my shibes =/ People are looking to ride the wave, and that means making their own coin and mining it, hoping the value increases a few satoshi over the launch and making tons of money in the process. 

What can we do? We need to differentiate dogecoin from the other joke coins. We need to show the world that shibes are united and strong. The joke is wearing off, but a fun loving, accepting community will always be popular.

The first thing is to stay strong, not panic, and contribute to the community. The resources around dogecoin have grown a ton in the past few days, and I hope that continues. You shibes are all doing amazing work :) The second thing is to make dogecoin the official tipping currency of a significant website. We've talked about it becoming the official currency of reddit, that would go a huge way to us being differentiated from the other coins, and taken seriously. Finally, we need to improve the press coverage. The press needs to talk about significant milestones with dogecoin, and not lump us in with every other new cyrpto. This means new huge purchases (like the car) solely with dogecoin. This means spreading the shibe love. This means getting celebrities involved. This means more marketplaces, exchanges, etc. 

There can only be a few coins that are successful. People aren't going to want to hold multiple different types of currencies to pay for goods. Bitcoin is a store of value, maybe lightcoin or digitalcoin will be successful, but dogecoin can be the coin of the internet. 

We can do this fellow shibes. The crypto gold rush has only just begun, but only one coin has the backing of the internet. Let's make it happen!",cryptocurrency,1388802834

personalfinance,Should I get a car? Budget and income details inside.,"A little about me:
I'm a 23-year-old female living in the Dallas area with a roommate. I currently use the DART bus/train system to get around. I used to have three jobs, but that was killing me, so now I just work front desk at a hair salon for 9/hour plus commission. I only have 15 hours/week guaranteed, but I pick up an extra shift or two once every pay period. 

The bus situation is fine when I'm just going home or don't have to get anywhere by a certain time, but I feel like I'm always going to be late to work if I take the bus there because I need to take 2 buses, and if the first one is late, I won't make the transfer in time. Usually I can con my roommate/before/mother into taking me to work, but I don't want to keep doing this long-term. I don't want to be a leech.

I have an two-year degree in general studies from Collin County Community College and am still taking online classes that will transfer to UTD toward an accounting degree.

I was recently offered a full-time job that would pay in the vicinity of 15/hour, but I had to decline it due to not having a car. The commute would be 2 hours and involve two buses and a train. Because I would have to be there at 7:30 in the morning, there would be a good chance that I would be late (and then fired).

The lady that interviewed me really liked me, and said she would keep my info on file. I'm supposed to alert her if or when I get a car. I've got a friend who works there vouching for me and my scores on the pre-interview tests were good. Job is 90% guaranteed.

Okay, onto my information:

Monthly Expenses:
Rent: $435
Utilities: $31
Minimum credit card payment: 40 (I usually pay at least 55 toward the card, though)
Cat food/litter: $30
Bus pass: $80 

Electricity is covered by my roommate in exchange for me doing all the dishes. Food expenses are covered by food stamps. I get 189/month.

Monthly income:
$566 after taxes from the Hair Bar. Hourly plus commission. Commission is usually between 40 and 100 (before taxes) per two week pay period.
~$120 freelance editing work. I re-write market analysis documents for roughly 5/page.

Other income:
On February 12th I'll get $3,350 in student loans. Classes and fees will be $354 and I'm estimating about $200 for books based on past expenses. This will leave me with about $2790 after school expenses.

Current Debts: 
$15,500--Student Loans. Interest rates between 3.86% and 6.8%
$1,500--Credit Card APR 19.99%
$344--Care Credit APR 19.99%. Currently balance will not have interest until May.

So, do I get a car?
As you can see from the above information, I'm in quite a fucking pickle with my currently income vs. debt ratio. And just income in general. I think the car would help me get that better job.
Do I suck it up and keep using the bus?
Do I take out a loan and use some student loan money for the down payment?
Or do I just take a couple grand and by the cheapest car I can find?

Help would be much appreciated. Thanks so much.

Bitcoin,any thoughts on my idea for bitcoin Leverage-Only platform..,"http://www.strikingly.com/kryptonproject

how it works:

1. Lend USD at a daily interest rate to trader
2. Trader deposits 100$ and gets upto 1000$ for a long-position on BTC 
3. Funds cannot be withdrawn so there is no counter party risk for lending
4. If BTC price grows by 10% in a month, trader earns upto 100$ on top of his deposit. If BTC falls, the margin can be set to withdraw before full loss of deposit.

Its only for a leveraged position, not dealing with short position.

I am aware of Bitfinex and other platforms but Krypton project will be BTC Leverage-Only platform, because I believe limiting to a few moving parts will be easier to scale. 

Its just an idea right now",cryptocurrency,1388837773

economy,Is gold / silver a good investment at the moment?,"A family member is busy putting all of their money into physical silver, as well as physical gold (but less gold). This person expects to make major returns, but I am concerned that they are wasting their money and will take major losses.

This person is an avid follower of Mike Maloney, GATA and the like, and they expect the federal debt ""bubble"" to burst presently, forcing the collapse of the US and then world economy, and then a massive spike in the value of gold, and silver.

According to Mike Maloney and GATA, there has been massive fraud and price manipulation on gold, with the stated ""paper"" gold supply outstripping the physical gold stocks through mechanisms like gold leasing.

They also expect the BRICS nations to stop using the dollar, and create their own currency, backed by gold.

This seems a bit on the conspiritard side of the fence to me, and I would like to find some *reputable* sources where I can educate myself as to the real state of:

- How much paper vs how much physical gold is out there?
- Is there any proof of price fixing on gold?
- How much debt is the US economy really in, and how will it be paid back?
- Will BRICS create their own currency? If so, would it be backed by gold?
- What is the long term forecast on Silver? What are the underlying factors in the silver price?

personalfinance,(21yo) Looking for some financial advice for budgeting and credit debt.,"Hey Personal Finance! I have been a long time subscriber and this is my first post.

I am a 21 year old male. I am unfortunately in some credit card debt. It all happened when I moved out to a new place on my own and unexpected expenses came, along with some immature spending habits. As far as debt this is what I am looking at.

Card 1: $3100. I just settled with the company. I closed the account and set up a low monthly payment of $56 at 2% interest. I am planning on paying hopefully double the amount each month. 60 month payment plan. 

Card 2: $1900. I am planning on calling them and doing the same as the first card.  

Card 3: $750. This is my oldest credit card. I am planning on using my tax return to pay it in full. I want to keep it open. It only has a $750. I plan on cutting the card and just keeping the account to help my credit score. 

Card 4: $300. Low monthly payment. Plan on paying it off quickly. Not a big issue. 

Car: $9000 with 8% interest. 


Basically my plan this year is to get as much out of debt as possible. I have recently been promoted at my work, and it is allowing me to get out of the whole I am in if I handle my finances properly. I am looking for some sound advice from people who have gone through the same thing and succeeded or people who are just really good with budgeting.

I recently got promoted at my job. I went from making 11.19 an hour to making 13.44. I went through my last 5 pay stubs and averaged out what was being deducted each check. 

Income Monthly: 

Gross: $2150.40
401K (5%): $107.5
Federal Tax (Avg 12%): $245.14
Fed Medical: $30
OASD: $132

Net Income after tax: $1562


Expenses:

Rent: $400 (Will most likely be going down to $300 in February with a new roommate)  
Car Payment: $200 ($9000 car with 8% interest)
Car insurance: $226 (Expected to go down to approximately $180 in the next month) auto deducted from my paycheck. 
Utilities: $75 (Expected to go down a a little when the new roommate moves in. 
Spotify: $10
Game subscription: $8
Gas: $100 (more or less depending on the month. My commute to work is less than 5 miles. My girlfriend lives 50 miles away when she goes to school and my family lives 50 miles away as well. $100 is just an average)
Food $200 (As of right now this is just a budget. I am planning on buying food more smart. This is an area where I would like some advice to handle spending properly.)

Credit card 1: $56 set payment with 2% interest
Credit card 2: Currently about $50. Planning on calling and canceling the card and setting up a payment plan. 
Credit card 3: $20. Planning on paying off completely when I receive my tax return. 
Credit 4: $25. Hoping to have this payed off in a month or two. 

So after all my current expenses, it looks like I will have approximately $370 extra a month. When the new roommate moves in I will have approximately $520 a month. Like I said. I do have a girlfriend and I do like to have a good time with her every now and then. We don't do a lot that requires money and we split cost a lot. 

I don't have a lot of bad habits that require money. I don't smoke or do any drugs. I drink occasionally. I have had a problem in the past with impulse buying. I have done better lately. 

Basically I want advice on what to do with my extra money. I am hoping to get my “Card 2” down to around a 2% interest rate like my “Card 1” That would leave me with generally low payments and interest would not be killing me. Considering that my car has higher interest should I focus as much as I can towards that every month with my excess cash? Or should I divide it up. 

I would also like to save cash for emergencies. Considering the debt I am in. How much should I save every month instead of putting it towards debt. Any other general advice would be appreciated. 

Some good advice for meal planning would be awesome as well. Grocery shopping is an area I really need help.",finance,1388885479

personalfinance,Is this a bad time to invest in index funds?,"Hi, I recently hit a personal savings goal and I'm looking to put some of my saved money into a better place than holding it as cash. I have more than enough for a six month emergency fund, have already maxed out my Roth IRA for 2013 and 2014, and contribute the maximum amount to my 401k. I'm currently holding about $40k in cash.

I'd like to put my extra cash into index funds, since I don't have any short-term items I'm saving for and don't plan to need the money soon. However, the market seems to be at a historical high, and the Federal Reserve beginning its ""tapering"" of asset buying seems likely to cause a dip. This leads me to think it might not be a great time to get into the market.

Additionally, I'm unsure of how to allocate my potential investments. I'm already following a ""lazy portfolio"" for my Roth IRA, consisting of about 40% in the S&amp;P 500, 40% in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, and 20% in the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund. If I were to do the same funds in my non-IRA account, I feel like I'd be doubling my risk...but I also feel like my risk is diversified enough to be essentially a ""total market"" risk, so I don't know if that can be avoided?

tl;dr: I want to reduce my cash holdings and I think index funds might be a good way to do this, but I'm not sure if this is a good time to buy into the stock market or which funds to choose. Any thoughts?",finance,1388889815

I'm working on tax estimates now, and trying to decide whether I should use some of my cash savings to make retroactive 2013 contributions to a traditional IRA, which would increase my state+fed tax refund by about 50%, and then I could replenish the savings account with the refund (I am not worried about the possibility of needing to use the cash between now and receiving my refund). **First question: is this legitimate/a great idea/dumb?**

Whether or not I do the above, I plan on taking about half of whatever refund I get (minus whatever needs to go back into savings) for discretionary spending. With the other half, would I be better off reducing my student loan debt (95% federal, and I'm on IBR) or just getting a headstart on this year's retirement contributions? **Second question: best use for the small tax refund windfall?**

I will have no problem paying the minimum(194.25) with my current temp job, and hope to repay in 2-4 years as I transition to a long term job this spring. My degree is in CS so hopefully in the next 3 months I will be able to find a job that pays reasonably well. I plan to keep living as I am now and put any extra I make towards the loans.  

I want to run my repayment plan by everyone to make sure its the most efficient way, as there seem to be a few gotchas people run into when paying extra. I also have one question about the loans I can't figure out.   

I don't understand how one of the loans has accrued interest while the other 3 haven't. Since it's a subsidized loan shouldn't the government be covering all interest until repayment? If there was some gap where I wasn't considered full time wouldn't I have accrued interest on all the loans? It doesn't make sense to me that I accrued interest on only one of them and that it was the most recently dispersed. Anyone have any ideas about how this is possible? I will call them Monday if I can't figure it out.

Here is my plan to repay, please point out anywhere I can improve or anything to watch out for.

Sign up for autopay on all 4 loans, this will give me a .25% cut on the interest rates. 2 weeks after the autopay I will pay as much as possible that month towards the loan with the highest interest rate. I will select ""do not advance due date"" as that seems to force the extra payment to be applied to principal.

I am trying to pitch my GF's 403b plan to her and want to make sure I have everything down.,"My GF started working as a nurse 24 hrs a week with the likelyhood of it becoming a full time position. They automatically enrolled her into a fedelity 403b at 1% of her biweekly base pay. She is currently paying of 30g or so in student loans as well as a 15g car loan. 

I am trying to convince her to contribute at least 5% because her employer will match 3% (which is the max match.) I don't want to talk out of my ass, so my question is what does this mean?

If she contributes 5% of her biweekly pay, what does the employer actually contribute? I googled it but the answers aren't clear to me.

Also reading through the plan, there is a vested table. She has to work 5 years to be vested 100% of the plan. 4 years is 75% 3-50% 2-20% and 1-0%. If she plans on leaving before 5 years, should she even bother making contributions? or should she start a roth IRA?

I'd love for any insight above. If anyone is whilling to take a look at the next part god bless you. 

The other end of this, is how will her retirement fit mine if we happen to stay together.

I currently have a 457 plan maxed out with 105k in it after 6 years, as well as a pension (as long as it isn't lost in negotiations between now and retirement.)

If her and I stay together and she stays at her employer, would it be more beneficial for her to max out her 403b and for me to throttle back my contributions to my 475 if money gets tight with kids and such?

Would it be better for one of us to just start a roth instead of the 403b/457k and the other max out a employee plan?

I know I have asked a lot of questions, advice on any of these would be beneficial. 

Thanks in advance!


Edit: heres what the 403b faq says for employer matching as well as vesting. 

""Does my employer contribute to my account?""

If you are making tax deferred contributions, you are eligible to receive employer matching contributions right away. 

1% of biweekly base pay - employer match 1%
2%- 1.5%
3%- 2%
4%- 2.5%
5% or more- 3%

You must be making tax deferred contributions to receive matching contributions. 

Also her is the ""When am I vested?""

You are always 100% vested in your contributions to the (company name) matching TSA 403b plan, as well as any earnings on them. Your employer's matching contributions and any earnings vest according to the following schedule:

years of service-1 - 0%
2 - 20%
3 - 50%
4 - 75%
5 - 100%

You earn one year of vesting service for each plan year in which you complete 1000 hours of service. You earn credit for vesting whether or not you participate in the TSA if you leave before you vest in your emloyer's matching contributions, your forfeit any non vested contributions. Forfeitures are used to reduce your employers future contributions to the plan.",finance,1388942337

I'm not entirely sure I know how to interpret this data from year to year, as I keep hearing about using ""yield"" AND ""capital appreciation"" to determine it. 

If I have $10k in GS10 bonds in Year 1900, what would they be worth in 1901, assuming the interest rate was 3.15% (for January 1900, it was). Is it simply $10000 * 1.0315 = $10,315?",finance,1388949391

* 23 Years old  
* 3K income after taxes  
* 1.5K available for bills  
  
I pay 1.5k in credit card debt first, highest interest first. After this I'll pay off the student loan but also start an emergency fund since when I pay on the student loan the next payment due date is pushed further down the road and the interest rate isn't as high as the credit card interest I'd have to use should I lose my job or mind.  
  
Near future goals:  
* Working on getting some side gigs going (suggestions?)  
* Get a new used car, budget 5 - 8k (mandatory as current will fail)  
* Vacation  
  
Distant future goals:  
* Get a house  
* Rather nice savings saved up

Its depressing and its a rat race as I've come to hear it called. If I saved up $500 each month and put it into a 401K or IRA, in years I will have put a total of $60,000 into the 401K and if the stock market doesn't screw me over I'll probably be sitting on around $100,000 if things are very good. However I'd have to do that non-stop until I was able to retire to actually pull from it (age 64).

personalfinance,Questions on repayment priorities,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am currently 24 and in the process of paying of $120,000 of student debt.

I am currently living with my parents and commuting to work using public transportation. I have a Honda Civic (which is being paid off by my parents), on the condition that I treat it as my own. This means that my automotive expenses tally around **$1400** a year (maintenance, insurance, gas). My total commute costs for the year are **$1200**.

Aside from that, I pay the internet and cable bill which is **$780** a year. I set aside a budget of **$200** a month for leisure, but really spend about **$90** a month.

I've been job hopping since graduating, when I started making under $30,000 and am currently making **$60,000** a year. At my old job, I saved up **$5,000** in a savings account and started my 401k (not much, I have just $200 in there). Currently, my debt is **$68,200** worth of loans, of which **$19,630** are federal loans.

I'm paying off the highest interest rate loan first, while paying a bit more than minimum on all the other loans.

My question is: should I keep on putting in most of my money towards my _private_ student loans first, as they are the ones with a higher interest rate? Also, I was wondering if I should perhaps start investing (whether it be stock market or in property -- my father keeps on suggesting that we co-sign on a foreclosure)?

personalfinance,20 y/o Male Needing Advice and Help,"I moved back in September from a small town to a large city in an attempt to get a job and while I did get a job the move itself ended up destroying any possible long-term safety net/ emergency budget that I had built up to that point. I’ll give you a quick outline of my financial information.

I ended up getting screwed over on a car loan back when I was around 17 y/o and I pay around $ 258 and some change a month and along with that the law requires insurance so I pay about $ 97 for that as well; after that the most important of all is rent which costs me $ 300 a month. This pretty much sums all of my expenses to the dime however this 9th I will also have to start paying student loans (mind you I’ve applied to have my federal student loans to be deferred but am still waiting to see if it goes through or not.) and got some medical bills that went unpaid from a couple months ago that I didn’t know about and both are $ 65.

I got my job back in the middle of November and was told during training that when I started I would be getting 4 hours of work every night for the whole week but when I finished training they didn’t just cut hour hours but literally whole days of work and it went down to 4 hours a week. Now I’m making $ 260 a month so a full $ 395 short of what I need. Also take in mind that the situation is even more grim because I’ve missed 4 weeks of work because the holidays just happened to land on the two days I work and my employer claims he can’t shift my current schedule.

I have nothing against picking up a second job and a matter of fact I’ve been looking for second work for quite a while now however every time I get a hit it seems to flop. I just need… help, I’ve got like $ 27 to my name right now. I’m getting desperate by this point and losing all hope at any way of recovery or way to get through this. Any advice is appreciated and I just need to know of the different opportunities I have that I possibly wouldn't know about or if I’m doing anything wrong. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

TL;DR: Hours at work got cut, no idea what to do, no emergency fund because of move back in September.

economy,2014 will answer this huge question about the U.S. economy,"The United States is poised for its strongest year of economic growth since the recession began. Signposts for the economy are generally pointing up. A recovery that seemed tentative and halting a year ago now appears to be durable and more deeply entrenched.

Sound familiar?

It should. Those are all phrases from an article that ran in The Washington Post on Dec. 31, 2010, projecting how the economy would fare in 2011. I know because [I wrote it](http://koyalgroupinfomag.com/).

If your memory is shaky, here’s what actually happened in 2011. There was a disruptive earthquake in Japan, an oil price spike caused by the Arab Spring, and a euro-zone crisis that was so severe as to endanger the entire global financial system, and a confidence-shattering debt ceiling showdown in the United States, and austerity by state and local governments that sapped growth. The U.S. economy kept growing, but at the same kind of sluggish, uneven rate it had in 2010 and, for that matter, 2012 and 2013.

One lesson of that is to view any predictions for what will happen in 2014 through a lens of skepticism. Year after year, forecasters have viewed better days as being just around the corner, only to see the U.S. economy disappoint. (Read more on that [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/03/2014-will-answer-this-huge-question-about-the-u-s-economy/)).

Here’s the case for optimism in 2014. The forces that have held back growth for the last half a decade are abating. Fiscal policy will be less of a drag in 2014 than it was in 2013. The recoveries in housing, consumer spending, and business investment show all signs of remaining underway. And threats from abroad look to have dissipated, with scant evidence that the euro-zone crisis will recur or that China or other emerging markets will fall into recession.

So the case for better U.S. economic growth in 2014 — something more in the 3 to 4 percent range rather than the 2 to 2.5 percent range which has been underway for nearly five years — is that all the forces that might keep strong growth from happening are in abeyance. That should allow the natural regenerative power of the capitalist economy to spring forth and return to something closer to full employment.

That’s the theory, anyway. Whether things work out that way will depend on how resilient that underlying growth turns out to be. This year should provide an answer to one of the biggest questions to haunt the U.S. economy over the last half-decade: Has the recovery been crummy because of bad luck, or because something was fundamentally broken about the U.S. economy?

The first possibility is that the economic recovery has been so sluggish simply because of bad luck mixed with some bad — but identifiable — policy choices. In 2011, for example (as mentioned above) there were a string of geopolitical events and natural disasters that held back growth, particularly the euro-zone crisis that kept financial markets on the verge of coming unglued for much of the year. In 2012 and 2013, it was the federal government tightening its purse strings.

If this story is correct, then the fundamentals of private demand have been increasingly strong. Housing has been recovering steadily for more than a year, but home construction remains well below historical trends and so should still have room to go. Businesses have been reluctant to invest for years, but could finally start to pick up the pace as the world’s economic luck improves and the outlook starts to appear sunnier; consumers, buoyed by rising stock and home prices and an improving job market, will do the same. All these trends will create a positive feedback loop. More confident consumers buy more stuff, leading businesses to invest and hire more to satiate the demand, in turn creating more jobs and higher wages.

That’s the way we could end up with a long-awaited year of above-trend growth, the 3 or 4 or 5 percent expansion that would go a long way to ending the long economic doldrums.

Unless, of course, the other theory of why growth has been so disappointing turns out to be true. Maybe weak growth has been caused not by bad luck, but by something more fundamentally broken in America’s economic machine.

Why is it, advocates of this theory, would observe, that growth was unimpressive even in the first years of the last decade, even before the crisis — even as an epic housing and credit bubble was underway? Could the crisis have represented not a short-term aberration, soon to reverse, but exposed the nation’s economic potential as being lower than it had seemed? (For a thoughtful examination of this possibility, see Larry Summers’s presentation at the IMF on the idea of a “secular stagnation.”)

If this is the real story, then maybe the weak growth of the last few years hasn’t been a simple story of a financial crisis followed by a string of bad fiscal policy choices and bad luck, but rather the broken U.S. economy returning to its previous form. 

Forecasters are complacent about the risks facing the United States in 2014, seeing little reason to fear that a new global financial crisis or new wave of fiscal tightening or oil price spike is looming. Assuming they are right, and none of those risks materialize, 2014 is the ultimate test of the two theories.

In other words, no more excuses: If we don’t finally see strong growth this year, it’s time to admit that maybe we don’t understand what ails the economy as well as the crisp models used by forecasters would suggest.",finance,1388986334

- $1,011 - AMEX Credit Card from USAA - 21.90% APR, I pay about $30 a month which obviously isn't making much of a dent in the balance. :(

Now, as far as income, I average about $3,000 a month of take-home money. Monthly bills are listed below : 

* Rent - $889
* Car/Renter's Insurance - $115
* Gym - $30
* Cell Phone - $200 (I pay for both myself and my fiancee's phone, and I require large data amounts for work. =/)
* Storage Unit - $30
* Natural Gas - ~$70
* Electricity - ~$75
* Water/Sewage/Pest - ~$60
* Internet/Cable - $71

I am a recent college graduate who somehow landed a decent paying job. I was wondering what could I use that I would be able to put money in every paycheck or so to try and get decent returns over time. Savings accounts have horrible interest rates; but they are nice as I can pull money out of them at any time if needed (car breaks - need repairs or to buy a different car; etc). I have been trying to read up on mutual funds and index funds, but it is hard to tell what most are like as they seem to vary a lot.

I come from an extremely poor family (first college graduate, etc.) so I do not have a lot of financial security to back myself up in the event of losing a needed function (such as my car). With that in mind, what would you recommend as the best thing to invest in that I could dump biweekly or monthly paychecks into over time to hopefully build up money; that I would still have the ability to get out of if needed? I already have a decent 401k started and all that jazz.

If you do recommend mutual funds or index funds, what are the fees commonly associated with those or what should I look for to not get screwed out of money?

I just want to get out of this hole and never look back. I obviously will never drive intoxicated (I hit no one luckily).

I moved to a new area of the states for work as a contractor guaranteed for 1 1/2 years that started 9/2013 because it payed more than my previous job and provided more opportunities. I bought a bed for that reason. I pay $300 to share insurance with my brother, but my brother won't let me use it to fix my car.

Luckily, I am able to walk to work. I get free coffee at work. I cook for myself usually and occasionally get lunch that is around $5-$7.

Any advice would help. I'm not sure what my next step should be, but I need to pay for my car damage immediately to the mechanic shop. It is a chain store, so they prob wouldn't do anything super shady, but I've spoken to my family and I'm not sure if they would want to help, which is fine I knew I would have to take care of this on my own. The car shop wants me to apply for a credit card to finance, but I highly highly doubt I would even qualify.

Can I take out a personal loan for $10,000 to pay for the car repairs, the student loan at 8.25%, and the bed? Or am I just crazy and will need to find some way to pay for my car immediately. I can pawn my guitar and Nintendo 2DS, which might bring me $250-$300 extra.

personalfinance,Paying for College?,"I'd rather not have my family's financial situation connected to my main account, so yes, this is a throwaway.

 I'm currently a year and a half from matriculating. Most colleges I'm planning to go to have a Cost of Attendance in the ballpark of 60k, and according to the rough results of financial aid calculators, these colleges will give me ~10k in grant money. I can't expect much, if any, merit aid because these are top colleges, and Ivy League schools don't offer any. Are living expenses (clothes, food, entertainment, etc.) included in the CoA? If not, how much would I roughly expect to pay on top of the CoA for these, assuming I live moderately and don't get too crazy with clothes and drinking?

My family of four (my sibling is a younger sister) has an income of ~135k a year (should be near 200k this year due to one-time capital gains), and has ~200k in non-retirement savings and investment accounts. Our home's mortgage is all but paid off, and it's comparable value is sitting at 185k, approximately the price it was bought at. 

I personally have no assets, and no job. My parents have said that they can contribute 25k a year to paying for college. I'm not sure about what federal loans will be available for me, but I am definitely not eligible for a Pell Grant. 

So for one, would it be too late for my parents to set up and contribute to a 529 plan? I'll check out the copious threads on /r/PersonalFinance regarding 529s if it is not too late. 

I haven't been able to make sense of what federal loans I would be eligible for. However I do understand that those loans hold many benefits (interest deferring until after graduation, lower interest rates). With these loans, would it be me, my parents, or both who are supposed to pay them back?

After the grant aid and my parent's contribution, I have a remainder of 25k. Some common numbers I've found for federal loan limits is near 5k, so that leaves 20k for me to make up with private loans.
For these student loans, will I be the only one responsible for them, or will it be just my parents, both, or does it depend on the firm giving the loan and its policies? 
If I were to take a private student loan out today, (considering I can't expect you guys to forecast what interest rates would be in the future) if my parents have a FICO credit score in the high 700s, what interest rates could I expect on a 20k a year principal (100k total)?
What firms offer the most competitive rates and additional benefits for private student loans? Would my parent's credit score affect student loan rates if I took them out individually? If I start building my credit score now (likely by just piggybacking on my parent's credit cards and becoming an authorized user), would that affect interest rates on my loans?

economy,Four reasons why the economy will take off in 2014 and four reasons why it might not.,"The economy abounds with hopeful signs as the New Year arrives, enough that the Federal Reserve will begin to put its easy-money punch bowl on a higher shelf by trimming its bond purchases this month. But after five years of crisis, recession and an aren't-we-there-yet recovery, we don't fully trust the signs.

And that's why Mesirow Financial economist Diane Swonk sums up the outlook in a nutshell:

""[2014 could be the breakout year](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/01/03/2014-us-economy-outlook/4030901/),'' she says. ""This is the year when we're going to find out.''

Find out what?

• Whether young adults who have put off forming households finally move out of Mom and Dad's, giving housing construction a needed boost.

• Whether the economy can really grow at an annual pace of 3% to 3.5%, generating 250,000 jobs a month and pushing unemployment to near 6% of the workforce, once freed of the drag from higher federal taxes and spending cuts that depressed 2012 and much of 2013.

• Whether the torpor of the last few years, in other words, was simply a bad hangover from an especially nasty, debt-fueled recession — or whether the economy has entered a sluggish New Normal, where 2% to 2.5% annual growth and a 7%-ish unemployment rate are as good as it gets.

**2014 STOCK OUTLOOK:** Can mighty Wall St. bull keep charging in the New Year?

**5 RISKS:** Potential problems that could derail the bull market

For the first time in years, forecasters got the U.S. economy basically right in 2013. The consensus outlook said the private economy would grow 3% or more, while a shrinking government would cut as much as 1.5 percentage points off growth, either directly or indirectly, leaving the overall economy growing 2% or so.

That's what has largely happened, at least until a fall surge in spending and hiring raised hopes before the final numbers are calculated.

November data were better-than-expected across the board, with hiring and retail sales beating forecasts and unemployment dropping to 7.0% for the first time in five years. And a big upward revision in data on the economy's third-quarter growth, announced Dec. 20, to 4.1%, suggests the push began sooner.

The optimism, as always, is qualified. The bull case depends on a sustained upturn in housing, as prices that are rising, if more slowly than in early 2013, spur significantly more construction to match the ongoing surge in auto sales. That's an especially big factor in the South, where half of new homes are built. But to get there requires better wage gains to support home payments and consumer confidence as interest rates rise to more normal levels — and those wage gains have only recently begun.

Here are four reasons to expect growth to pick up — and four more to worry that it won't.

**1. The housing recovery seems real this time.**

The top reason the recovery feels different this year is that housing is on more solid footing. The big question is, exactly how solid is it?

The biggest missing gap in the job market is that construction employment is down 1.9 million from 2007, including 1.4 million in home building and related categories. With total private-sector employment only about 700,000 below the peak — and manufacturing output back to setting all-time highs — the importance of housing is clear.

2014 forecasts for housing starts run from just under 1 million to as high as 1.35 million, up from about 950,000 in 2013. Moody's Analytics estimates each extra start is worth about 4.5 jobs, though rival consulting firm IHS says it's closer to three (Moody's includes more of the workers in ancillary industries, such as home-improvement stores). A housing market near the high end of forecasts could generate a million new jobs, pushing unemployment down by 0.7 of a percentage point or more.

**2. State and local governments have healed.**

One of the biggest changes in 2013 was that state and local governments went from firing people to hiring again, adding 127,000 workers through November on a base of about 19 million. That's because their spending turned slightly higher in the second and third quarter, the first two-quarter gain since the recession. Coming out of the last three recessions, state and local governments added 150,000 to 200,000 jobs a year, on a smaller base.

The state and local government recovery has room to grow more. Outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke pointed to one reason in his final press conference Dec. 18 — in the last three recessions or their immediate aftermath, government employment actually rose. This time, governments have shed about 1.1 million workers since 2010.

**3. Falling energy prices and slower increases in health care costs are keeping inflation low.**

The collapse in medical inflation since 2007, and the containment of total health spending it helps to enable, is one of the best things the economy has going for it. Medical inflation is at a 50-year low, with prices rising just 2.2% in the last 12 months. With the most important cost-containment measures in the Affordable Care Act just beginning to be implemented, it stands to stay low. That lessens a key cost pressure on businesses — and may free up more money to pay higher wages. Also, energy prices have fallen 4.8% in the last year, the government says, helping both household budgets and corporate income statements.

**4. Washington has shut up — mostly.**

[Economist](http://koyalgroupinfomag.com/) Joel Naroff's favorite political joke is that ""the only thing we have to fear is Washington itself.'' And Washington's actions did cut growth nearly in half in 2013 by many estimates. But budget cuts coming this year are much smaller, shrunk even farther by the budget deal reached in December that reworked automatic spending cuts mandated by a 2011 law. Plus, no major tax increases are planned. Compared with 2013, less Washington drag on the economy could mean an additional percentage point or more in growth.

[Four reasons why the economy won't break out:](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/01/03/2014-us-economy-outlook/4030901/)

**1. Washington is not that good — and we still have the debt ceiling.**

Federal spending cuts will still shave a few tenths of a point off GDP growth this year — reducing the growth rate about 0.3 percentage points, Naroff said. The main risk from D.C. early in 2014 is that there may be another showdown over the debt ceiling. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said Republicans want concessions for raising the borrowing limit before March — but haven't decided what.

**2. Capital investment is low.**

Growth in spending on business equipment, the category of investment most closely tied to boosting productivity, plunged to near zero by the third quarter from a double-digit pace in 2010 and 2011, helping to fuel a $2.2 trillion ""investment gap,'' of money not spent since 2007, according to the Progressive Policy Institute. Next year, it's expected to grow just 3.1%, the Equipment Leasing &amp; Finance Foundation says. That's versus double-digit percentage gains in 2010 and 2011.

This problem may evaporate by the second half of the year, especially if consumer spending sustains its recent pickup into early 2014, Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius argues. Historically, capital spending has depended on consumer spending and credit availability — and both are improving, he says.

**3. Interest rates will rise this year, which may slow the housing recovery.**

As the Federal Reserve reduces and eventually ends its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases, mortgage rates are likely to rise — just as they did in the summer, when the Fed first hinted at the so-called ""taper.'' In 2013, that blip caused momentum in the housing recovery to stall briefly.

With the average rate for 30-year mortgages now 4.48%, up from 4.1% in late October, and the National Association of Realtors projecting that they will rise another percentage point next year, it's too soon to know whether higher rates will slow the hoped-for construction boom. New-home sales and construction data from the fall suggest not. But it's a risk that bears watching.

**4. Wage growth is still tepid, and a recent improvement is not well-established.**

After a long decline, wages and personal income have turned higher in late 2013. The hope is that workers will get better raises as unemployment falls toward 6%. But the average gain in the last 12 months is just 2% — enough to offset the expiration of the payroll tax holiday last January, but no more than that.

If employers keep the upper hand in wage talks, that hurts consumer spending and home buying — and risks another year of sluggish growth. Goldman's Hatzius says consumer spending can sustain its recent gains with inflation-adjusted wage gains around 2%, because rising household wealth and an improving jobs market let consumers save less without taking a risk.

If wages rise faster, that would be the icing on the cake, Hatzius says. Higher wages and more plentiful jobs might also prove key to people forming more households, buying more homes, and even having more babies and spending more on diapers and clothes, Swonk said. The recession and its aftermath didn't just change how people shopped — it changed how they lived, she said. A lot depends on whether young people who have struggled to build careers and begin families amid the post-2008 mess move on with their lives, she says.

I found out after I graduated about the loan, and also, very quickly, that my certificate was useless. I was actually told by several people that I applied with, that they would have hired me if I HADN'T gone to that school.

So, now it's 10 years later. I have 2 kids, I currently am not working (daycare cost are significantly more than I would make) and my husband brings home right around 25k a year. My credit is so bad that we're having trouble moving to a new apartment because my score is so low that they don't want us. I don't know what, if anything I can do.

I have lots of small debts, a couple really old credit cards (they should be nearing the 7 year mark now) and some $100 or less charges for things like medical bills or cable providers. The huge giant thing dragging my credit down is the student loans. I was paying on them before my kids were born, for I think 3 years or so, but now we just simply don't have it. The last time I spoke to the loan company (sallie mae), they told me that they were going to send me to collections unless I gave them 3k right then and there and made 500 a month payments. They refused to even discuss my federal loans unless I did something with the private loan.

We bring home 1800 a month or so, and of that 750 goes to rent, 150 to utilities, 90 to cell phone, 100 to a bus pass for my husband, 90 for car insurance and renters insurance, about 60 for gas, 60 for internet, with the rest going to household items (diapers, clothes, dish soap ect) and food.

I'm not sure if bankruptcy or undue hardship is an option for us. I have talked to one or two attorneys and the first said that we probably wouldn't qualify, and the second said we would, but he wanted 250 dollars up front to keep talking about it. 

At this point, I don't see me honestly being able to pay of the loan ever. Last I checked the interest rate was over 16% and I owed like 30k or some outrageous amount.

Forex,Deutsche Bank's Quarter-by-Quarter 2014 Outlook for Currencies,"To see the images below that would put this all into context:  http://freevestor.com/deutsche-bank-forecasts-for-2014/

Deutsche Bank released currency forecasts and the Chief U.S. Economist at Deutsche Bank AG has made comments going forward into 2014 and the message bucks trends of the past and even seems a tad contradictory.  So let’s review the Deutsche Bank Forecasts for 2014 and see where the murkiness lies.

Currency Forecasts

Deutsche Bank put out their currency forecasts for each quarter below.

(missing image)

Deutsche Bank expects that the United States Dollar will strengthen against all majors and mid-major currencies.  Some of the highlights to note.

EUR/USD sits at around 1.36 now and a drop to 1.35 would indicate that by March 31, 2014 there would likely be ranging market activity.  It would be an extraordinarily flat quarter compared to the past 8 quarters.  Quarters 2-4 are expected to show much more activity to the downside.  The expectation here is that the taper, possible equities sell off and rushes to cash positions, and France’s new sickman of the Euro Zone role will be felt between April and June.

USD/JPY sounds about right for what most expect.  With a likely strengthening of the U.S. Dollar and a Japanese Yen that the Bank of Japan along with Prime Minister Abe’s efforts to end deflation at any cost, these rises are to be expected.  However, it is surprising that the 1st Quarter is so modest compared to Quarters 2-4.

GBP/USD makes more sense given the strength of the British economy and overall strength of the British Pound for Q1, GBP/USD falls more in line with other currencies against the United States Dollar for Quarters 2-4 in terms of expectations. The Bank of England has not been vocal about debasing their currency.

AUD/USD falls down to .88 in Q1, which would make RBA Governor Glenn Stevens none too pleased.  AUD/USD would eventually hit the so-called target of .85 at the end of 2014 according to Deutsche Bank.  Remember, Stevens is out of bullets to bring down the Aussie because he does not want to acknowledge nor bring about the possibility of a housing bubble.  All Stevens can do is jawbone right now.  Deutsche Bank appears to be counting out the possibility of a future interest rate hike.

NZD/USD will be hiking interest rates by June 2014, but yet the Kiwi will weaken?  Is the Kiwi just getting wrapped up in perceived future U.S. Dollar strength mania?  New Zealand’s economy is strong and growing and the RBNZ is the only major or mid-major central bank that is openly promising interest rate hikes.


U.S. Equities Predictions

Joseph LaVorgna, Chief U.S. Economist at Deutsche Bank, made five notable predictions.

Economic Growth Rate of the United States in 2014 will be 3.5% or better.
Unemployment Rate below 6.5%.
Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2%.
1o Year Treasury Yield to be 4%.
Quantitative Easing is put to an end in the Fall.
These economic predictions indicate economic strength and bullishness.  LaVorgna even stated, “the risk to growth is to the upside, not the downside. Beyond this, the primary downside risk in 2014, as it is in most years, is geopolitical, meaning we get some sort of negative exogenous shock such as an oil price spike.”

So there’s no bubble, apparently according to LaVorgna.  In fact, the markets will keep strengthening.  No corrections… no flat market… just straight growth and bullishness.

An unusual message

LaVorgna and the currency analysts at Deutsche Bank have interestingly contradictory messages as U.S. Dollar strength typically correlates with weakness in equity markets.  There is a negative correlation as those that wish to exit the equity markets hold onto cash (U.S. Dollars).  This is also the case because of credit rates rising in a post-boom environment.

NZD/USD vs DJIA (missing image)

AUD/USD vs. DJIA (missing image)

2013 bucked an overall trend of the strength of the U.S. Dollar against the Australian Dollar not being correlated negatively with the equity markets.

EUR/USD vs. DJIA (missing image)

Can the historical and overall trend of a weaker U.S. Dollar being negatively correlated to equity markets continue?  Will new taxes, increased health care costs, increased regulations, and the slow cutoff of Quantitative Easing lead to economic growth in the United States?  Cheaper dollars, lower taxes, and lessened regulations go together with economic growth.

We have conflicting messages here and it is possible that the currency analysts at Deutsche Bank believe that there is a great deal of uncertainty in the 1st Quarter and they couldn’t necessarily punt in terms of projections going forward in the year.  It will be interesting to see if they are both right, which is still possible.  2014 for equities though is going to be a year where profits and top-line growth will be thoroughly analyzed because companies cannot maintain margins by just cutting costs like they did in 2013.

My main priority is to make sure that this opportunity is not thrown away, to make sure I can keep it's monetary value stable for the mean time.

So, when I turned 18 years old, I 'unlocked' just over £500,000 from my father, which came out of a trust, which I only found about on my birthday, that I am very thankful for. My father has been ill for many years and this was done by his power of attorney. He is the only person that I feel would give me sound advice, but due to his condition, he cannot.

At the time I acquired the money, I put it into a savings account, where I can dip in and out of it when need be. The money has only really been used for living expenses, with no large expenditures at all. Nobody knows about the money, just my dad. I currently live with my girlfriend and a friend, so I rent out a small 2 bedroom apartment with him &amp; her.

As I am going to university soon, I need to start thinking about what I should do with this money, as I want to avoid it's value depreciating as much as possible, or if possible, at all. 

My initial thought was to buy an apartment and rent it out. Where I live, house prices are increasing at a desirable rate, which is much superior to that of bank interest rates. Most of the income being generated from the tenants would be put into some sort savings account, as I will hopefully get a job pretty quickly around my Uni, so I won't have to dip in to my savings too much. Another sort was putting the money in various bonds.

I am planning to see a financial adviser soon, but I would like to know what you guys would do if you were in my shoes? I feel quite lost.

My company has closed my branch office in Atlanta and is relocating our staff to HQ in San Francisco. For relocation expenses, we are each given a $5,000 lump sum. Our team was given an option:

* Accept $5k during December 31st, 2013 paycheck
* Accept $5k during January 15th, 2014 paycheck

Many of us elected for December 31st, thinking that we'd get the taxes over with in April 2014. HR contacted us all before holiday and asked us if we wanted a check FedExed after break because we'd be ""taxed by the state you are relocating to,"" and we'd have to file 2 tax returns for 2013, but would only have to file one return if we got it in 2014.

This seemed sensible, so I said just to include the lump sum in my January 15th payout instead. I now realize that this was probably stupid, because wouldn't I have to file 2 returns either way, 2013 or 2014?

Anyway, HR ignored my request to include it in the January 15th deposit paycheck, and FedExed the checks. I received it today. It is classified as a ""Bonus,"" and is taxed (heavily) by the state of California. I haven't even moved there yet. I haven't even signed a lease yet.

dogecoin,"My wife learned about Dogecoins before I did, but...","Hopefully little stories like these aren't too much off-topic.

My wife likes to visit Reddit a lot, she's more a regular frequenter than I am. However, she's not a tech specialist and generally doesn't follow tech news, crytpocurrencies, devices, etc. When I came home yesterday, I said, ""I started learning how to mine Dogecoins"" (last night, I downloaded minerd and tried getting some hashes computed at a cool ~~30~~ 12khash/s on my Macbook Air).

She said, ""Hey, I've seen the Dogecoin tip bot around. I thought that it was a Reddit thing like the /u/fedora_tip_bot. They're actually a thing?""

""Yeah, people accumulate them, mine for them, give them away, and even pay money for them.""

""WOW""

She was amazed that Dogecoin was an actual REAL currency and not just some kind of made-up money.

I encouraged her to get a Dogecoin wallet but she didn't see the point (yet). However, we did spent a bit of time reading about the details of crytocurrencies (especially learning where the Dogecoins miners earn from mining come from) as well as looking at what people are buying and selling with Dogecoins (the market has some remarkably real and tangible objects that aren't just trading one currency for another).

Long story short - some people who don't follow crypto currencies and tech news are picking up on the fact that Dogecoins are a thing - even if many of them think it's ""play money"".

Of that 3% of my portfolio it's about 2/3 LQD (corporate investment grade) in my Roth and 1/3 TRRMX (not sure what type of bonds this invests in) in my 401k.  My question is, with the impending rising interest rates, does it make sense to think about bonds right now?

I was reading [this](https://www.fidelity.com/insights/investing-ideas/bond-playbook-for-2014) article and I generated a a few ideas, some from the article, some looking at fidelity commission free ETFs (they are my brokerage).

* FLOT - Floating Rate Bond Fund - Backed by adjustable rate loans.  As interest rates increase, this fund should rise accordingly (one would hope)

* IGOV (or EMB)- International (or emerging market) Government Treasury Bonds - (not from the article) - I would assume that international bond funds would not as be susceptible to interest rate increases since only 3 or so governments are engaged in QE.  Would buying diversified international bonds accomplish this?

* ISTB (or SHY) - Short-term government bond funds - Bonds currently held in these funds should mature soon, not as dependent on interest rates.

* Then there are always the aggregate bond funds like AGG or BND - (not from the article) Low expense ratios, well diversified.

Any thoughts?  Would it be prudent to just hold off on my bond component for a while until the interest rate landscape becomes a little more certain?  I should mention that I still have about 14k of student loan debt at an average rate of like 4.25%.  I will be putting most of my savings towards that for the time being.  However, I still have about 3k of my Roth unfunded for 2013, so I'd like to fill that up and do something with that 3k (half BND half BTC? :D).

* A general question about bond funds vs stock funds.  Does excessive market interest (many buyers) drive up the price of bond funds, as it does with stock funds?  i.e. short-term and floating rate bond funds must be very popular in this climate, does that not mean these funds will be comparatively expensive?

Currently I'm a stay at home mom but I might go back to work later if I can. My husband and I both have maxed out Roth iras and he's maxed out his ira with matching contribution at work.  In the past few years we've managed to get about 100,000 in a regularly taxed brokerage account with (I think) reasonably diversified admiral shares of vanguard funds in addition to what's in the retirement accounts.  We also own our current house outright with a paid off mortgage.  We're lucky my husband has a good income but we are also careful and live relatively simply.

So we do not have an emergency fund as such which worries me. I've tried to convince the husband but he thinks the 100k in the taxable account is sufficient.  It is relatively liquid but is this a reasonable amount of risk?  It is definitely more than enough for our base expenses for 6 months if it doesn't lose half its value or something.

To further complicate the issue we want to buy a better house in the next year or 2.we agree that we should put at least a quarter of the value in a down payment for better interest rates on a mortgage.  We don't want to rely on selling our current house before we move out though so we'd probably have to use our investments that are currently also our emergency fund.  Most of the houses we're looking at are in the 300k-450k range.

**Edit: for anyone who doesn't want to view the imgur link here are a few of the main concepts**

&gt;""HERE ARE 5 IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT INVESTING IN THE 401(k) PLAN:

&gt;• You get FREE MONEY! That’s right. For every dollar you save in the 401(k) — up to the first
3 percent of your eligible compensation —
Best Buy contributes another dollar. In addition, Best Buy contributes $0.50 for each dollar of the next 2 percent of pay you save in the Plan.

&gt;• It’s convenient. Automatic payroll deductions make it easy to save. Unless you want to make a change, you set it and forget it. Plus, it’s out of sight, out of mind. You don’t see the money, so you may not even miss it.

&gt;• You pay lower taxes. Your contribution comes
out of your paycheck before federal and most state income taxes are deducted. This means you pay lower taxes now because your income is reduced by the amount you save. Plus, you don’t pay income tax on your contributions, the Company matching contributions, or your investment earnings until you withdraw funds from the Plan.

&gt;• The choice is yours. You decide how much to save — anywhere from 1 percent to 50 percent of your eligible compensation, up to the 2013 IRS maximum amount of $17,500*. Plus, you get to choose from many different investment options.

&gt;• The money in your account is yours to keep — even when you leave Best Buy. You are always 100 percent vested in your own contributions to the Plan and Company matching contributions.

&gt;* If you will be celebrating your 50th birthday this year (or already have),
you can make pre-tax contributions that exceed the 2013 IRS dollar limit for pre-tax contributions and the Plan’s maximum pre-tax contribution rate. Once you sign up for this “catch-up” feature, you will be automatically enrolled each year.""",finance,1389139331

economy,The 4 Major Challenges The U.S. Economy Faces In 2014,"During the year that is just starting the U.S. economy will face major challenges.  The pressures built in health care, monetary, and immigration policies are likely to lead to decisions that can have a major impact on economic growth.  There are always chances for additional positive and negative shocks.  A faster move to freer trade with Europe would be a positive shock.  A liberalization of North American energy markets, including the approval of the Keystone pipeline and continued progress in Mexico is another. [Negative shocks](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrochafuen/2014/01/01/the-4-major-challenges-the-u-s-economy-faces-in-2014/) can come not only from the economic arena, but also for national or international security threats, such as acts of terror or wars affecting the U.S. or its major allies.  Think Tanks are playing an important role in most of these battles.

The implementation of “Obamacare” or the “Affordable Care Act,” expanding government control of citizen’s health, will again be the major battle.  The US health sector is approaching 3 trillion dollars, or over 17% of total GDP.   Any major change in that market has huge implications. [Research](http://koyalgroupinfomag.com/research.html) focused think tanks that have been at the vanguard in proposing market oriented solutions include the National Center for Policy Analysis, NCPA, Dallas, Texas, and the Pacific Research Institute, PRI, California.  NCPA, led by John Goodman, started as a health policy center with the University of Dallas. It was thirty years ago this month when NCPA published a plan to use individually owned “medical IRAs” to tackle Medicare problems.  Goodman and Richard Rahn, then chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal describing the proposal, focused on the much needed personal ownership and portability.  Sally Pipes, President of PRI, uses her outstanding knowledge of the weaknesses of the Canadian socialized model to promote alternatives for the US health care market.  The Manhattan Institute, the only market oriented think tank to endorse the expansion of Medicare under President George W. Bush, also remains very active in the field, especially promoting the public/private solutions of Medicare Part D.

Those who study economic history understand that few things are more damaging to an economy than unsound money.  Germany in the 1920’s and Argentina are often mentioned as examples.  Smaller think tanks that cherish their independence from the banking elites have led the fight against the destruction of the dollar and the manipulation of money and credit.   Some are old like the Committee for Monetary Research and Education, CMRE, which has championed sound money for half a century, and the Lehrman Institute.   Others are of recent founding, such as the American Principles Project, which like Lehrman, promotes a gold standard.  The Mises Institute, in Auburn, Alabama, has stayed faithful to sound money since its founding in 1982.  Their work will be complemented by an enhanced effort by the Cato Institute to monitor the Fed and monetary policy.  Cato’s latest 2013 monetary annual monetary conference presented a solid program with renowned speakers describing the economic and political pitfalls of paper money.  The battle for sound money also includes efforts by editorial boards, Forbes comes to mind, as well as scholars, such as Nobel Laureate Robert Mundell and Allan H. Meltzer, President of the Mont Pelerin Society.  Meltzer is scheduled to testify next week in Congress where he will repeat his warnings about the dangers of the current monetary policies and propose better anchors.  A few free-market [economists](http://koyalgroupinfomag.com/) are more concerned by potential deflation.  They argue that the “fundamentals” have changed pointing to a higher demand for cash-balances from the new emerging middle class in China, India and others.  This higher demand neutralizes some of the monetary expansion.

Immigration reform is another battlefront with major economic implications.  The “Red Card” proposal based on two year work permits handled by the private sector, with the government performing an oversight for security purposes, should offer enough common ground.  The proposal comes from Helen Krieble, an intellectual entrepreneur working from her private foundation, rather than from think tanks.  In some of their papers, Heritage and Cato, which produced studies with widely divergent estimates of the cost and benefits of immigration, have endorsed relevant aspects of Krieble’s proposal.

Free trade is a great engine for growth.  The most important treaty under consideration is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, an effort to liberalize trade between the European Union and the United States.  While the effort to approve NAFTA counted with large network of free-market think tanks led by the Fraser Institute which worked to support its passage, no similar effort exists to promote TTIP.  The potential for wealth creation of these pacts hinge upon agreeing to build them around the best possible common denominators, the lowest tariffs, and the simplest and less burdensome regulations and non-tariff barriers.  Conservative and free-market leaders have been lukewarm in their support as they fear that the current administration favors the European welfare state and regulatory models and that the deal might end up promoting more interventionism.   A TTIP agreement which truly enhances free-trade would send a very positive signal and would likely spur further liberalization.

A 2014 with market-based health care and immigration reform, with freer trade and a sounder monetary policy would lead to a very happy new economic year.  But I am not so optimistic.  I expect that president Obama and his administration will try to make their health proposal work at all costs.  I doubt that think tanks will be able to make much progress against the Fed and the powerful interest that rely on their policies.   Immigration remains so contentious, that progress will be difficult.  The US-EU trade treaty has more chance for progress.  Let’s celebrate anyway a new year and join the effort of think tanks trying to liberate the entrepreneurial spirit from so many government shackles.",finance,1389142813

**Brief background:** Ivy league undergrad and Ivy league law school. Currently owe close to $300K in student loans when you take into account the interest that accrued while I was in school. Currently, employed and my salary is $150K (about $85K in NYC after taxes, insurance, etc.).

I'm currently enrolled in Income Based Repayment called IBR (since I made very little as a student in 2012 and 2013), so my payments are extremely low ($300 per month). However, I want to pay more than the IBR minimum obviously each month, which is why I'm here. Under IBR, the government pays the interest on my Stafford loans ($25K loan and a $65K stafford loan) so I don't really have to worry about interest on those for the next 2 years.

Let's say I plan to put **$3200** towards loans each month (I'll increase this amount next year or later in the year). Based on the interest rates below, what is my best course of action? I know it's always best to attack those with the highest rates first, so how should I allocate funds for these loans:

**Grad PLUS (35K)-** 8.25%

Monthly Interest Charge: $250

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $470


**Grad PLUS (150K)-** 7.65%

Monthly Interest Charge: $1100

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $1920

**Stafford (25K)-** 6.55%

(under IBR, interest rate is basically 0% for the next 2 years before going back to 6.55%) 

Monthly Interest Charge: $130

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $270

Monthly IBR minimum: $25

**Stafford (65K)-** 6.55%

(under IBR, interest rate is basically 0% for the next 2 years before going back to 6.55%)

Monthly Interest Charge: $350

Monthly Minimum on 10-year plan: $770

Monthly IBR minimum: $70



Also, is there benefit to consolidating the Stafford loans since they have the same 6.55% interest rate and are both covered by IBR?

personalfinance,Pay off loan or begin saving for retirement?,"Hi all,

I've posted here before asking for advice on credit cards and I lurk a lot on my main. I'd like to ask a question about paying off a high interest loan vs. saving for retirement.

In a few months, I will be starting a job that pays around $10,000 per month gross. I'm estimating a take home of around $7,000 on my current visa status (no FICA tax, yay!), and I live in a high cost of living area (SF bay).

I owe around $32,500 on a student loan which has a whopping 13.5% interest rate. This loan was taken in another country, which has such high interest rates, because I'm not an American citizen and I have my family home in said country.

I'm considering two potential budgets for myself. One will enable me to pay off the loan really quickly, while one will enable me to save for retirement, but spend two-three years paying off the loan.

**Option 1**

Monthly take home (No 401k contribution, no IRA contribution) = ~$7000

Rent + utilities	                 $1,400.00 

Loan Repayment	                 $3,500.00 

Car payment + insurance + gas	 $700.00 

Misc	                                 $500.00 

Saving for emergency fund (exactly 1/10 of gross)	 $958.33 

**Option 2**

Monthly take home (401k maxed upto $17500, IRA maxed upto $5500) = ~6000

IRA	 $458.33 

Rent + utilities	 $1,400.00 

Loan Repayment	 $2,000.00 

Car payment + insurance + gas	 $700.00 

Misc	 $500.00 

Saving for emergency fund (exactly 1/10 of gross)	 $958.33 


My main concern is to get rid of the high interest student loan debt before I have to pay FICA and see my take home pay drop lower. Which is the better option out of these two?

personalfinance,I turned my finances around in 2013 and paid off $28k of my $110k in student loans! Here is how I did it.,"http://imgur.com/a/IJBjN

I decided at the beginning of 2013 to try and do something about the dire straights my finances were in. I graduated in 2011 with about $115k in debt and up until January was only making the regular payments on these loans. Today, my debt stands at $81k! I hope to be entirely debt free within three to four years. 

Here are some of the main things I did in 2013 to increase my cash flow in order to funnel more money towards my student loans:

1.	Cut Cable! I saved over $1,100 in 2013 by cutting cable and have rarely missed it. Most of the sports I watch I get through an over the air HD tuner and the other games I go to friends places (sometimes bars though). Perhaps some of my increased bar spending could be attributed to this. I rarely watch movies and use red box when I do (only twice in 2013).
2.	Stopped shopping so much and getting cash out of the ATM! I had a bad habit of taking $40 or $60 out of the ATM every few weeks and before I knew it, it was gone. Well, in 2013 I cut my ATM habit by $650 and my shopping by $550, total savings of $1,200!! Biggest way I cut my shopping habit was going to the library instead of logging on to Amazon. 
3.	Decrease travel costs: I mainly did this by not going on any trips in 2013 where I had to fly! Instead I went on cheaper camping and hiking trips that were just as fun and significantly cheaper! Saved over $500 here.
4.	Changed from Roth 401(k) to regular 401(k). This had the simple benefit of decreasing my tax liability thereby increasing my take home pay.
5.	Sold off PTO days. I am pretty lucky that I can sell off some PTO days each year at my company. I get a total of 23 days so they weren’t really missed, in fact I actually lost a few days in 2012 because I didn’t sell them or use them!
6.	Consolidated my federal student loans. This decreased my overall monthly payment on these loans which allowed for more cash to be used as extra payments on my Private Loans.
7.	Promotion and Raise! All of the hard work I put in at the job did not go unrecognized and I got a promotion with a 13% raise, I then got another raise six months later! Woohoo!

Some general areas where I was already saving a lot of money:

1.	I don’t own a car! I walk to work and use zip car when I need a car for something. Other trips I take the bus or train. It’s actually freeing to dump your ride because you get to dump the cost of car payments, gas, insurance, and maintenance! These costs alone would have forced me to cut my student loan extra payments by one-third to one-half in 2013. 
2.	My grocery bill averages $161 per month. I eat low cost but healthy. Lots of rice and chicken. Use your crock pot!

-------------
Again, a HUGE thank you to this subreddit for being an awesome community. I couldn’t have kept it going without you guys. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have and I will do my best to answer them. Also, if you have any further suggestions on how I can do even better in 2014, let me know!

Bitcoin,Why the feds should sell their DPR bitcoin to institutional investors,"After nearing the $1000 threshold once again, the price of bitcoin corrected yesterday and now trades around $815.  But with the spate of recent positive news re merchant adoption (Overstock, Zynga, maybe Netflix), institutional interest (Fortress / Pantera), and regulatory wins (India, US - see Tid Bits), it’s hard not to like Bitcoin in 2014.   

There is only one piece of news that seems to be applying downward pressure on Bitcoin prices.  And I believe that news is being wildly misinterpreted.  Yesterday, TechCrunch broke a story on the arrest of another one of the Silk Road moderators in Ireland, but buried the lead: 

*In related news, the millions of dollars in bitcoin seized by the FBI from Ross Ulbricht and the first Silk Road, currently stored in a set of online wallets, appears to be on the move. A source in the U.S. Justice Department said that “authorities” have access to the Ulbricht’s bitcoin cache and may be selling it off for less volatile currencies in the next few weeks. Ulbright has given the U.S. government the private keys to the bitcoins.

“The reason for selling is that the Government has lost faith in the value of bitcoin and does not want to deal with the volatility of the currency,” the source said.*

The prospect of a government firesale spooked many people within the Bitcoin community, and rightly so.  Yet while a rapid wholesale of the seized Silk Road assets would overwhelm the market and send the price of bitcoin crashing, it’s hard to imagine the government acting so foolishly.  Say what you want about our dear leaders, but you can bet your ass that they will be careful when cashing in $115 million worth of found money (market rate for the ~144,000 seized bitcoins).  They have two much better options.  The first obvious solution is to wind down the position gradually…maybe 1000 BTC per day, and deal with the ensuing near-term volatility.  Within less than six months, they could take their gains without breaking the market.

There is also a second, better option that has been neglected: if the federal government has indeed lost faith in the value of bitcoin (which is an insanely ironic claim given QE 1-infinity) and desires a quick disposal of its assets, it might do well to consider an institutional sale.  If 2014 proves to be the year of the institutional investor in Bitcoin, the feds are a big seller in a sellers market.  There could already be plenty of interested parties with the liquidity to make such a large scale asset purchase.  Dan Primack at Fortune broke news before New Year’s about the $150 million bitcoin-related fund that Fortress Investment Group is forming with Pantera capital.  Is it really that unlikely that a trading desk at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, BofAML, Citi, Morgan Stanley, etc. buys a similar stake?  If that is a possibility, then Wall Street is in the complementary “buy” position to the feds’ ”sell” position.

Moreover, you have have to believe that in the event of an auction like this, the feds would be tipping their hand when it comes to their anticipated regulatory stance on Bitcoin.  ”It’s a legal commodity, Wall Street…fire away!”  The enormity of a federal asset sale to institutional investors cannot be understated from a legislative perspective, either.  If Wall Street starts making money within the Bitcoin ecosystem, they could call off the lobbying dogs that would otherwise work to impede Bitcoin’s progress within the existing regulatory framework.",cryptocurrency,1389199594

Bitcoin,Wall Street and How we can use it to Help Bitcoin,"There are many benefits about increased Wall St. interest in BTC.

I'm surprised at the level of anger at Wall St. on this sub by a few.

Please allow me to give some food for thought for those who are cautious about the investment business:


- **Wall Street/ the investment business is not monolithic**- it's not all comprised of the top bankers at the 5-10 firms people list off when they speak of bad guys --- there are thousands of firms, hundreds of thousands of professionals and the overwhelming majority did no to harm others.  It is most fair to judge people by what they themselves have done.

- **Yes, the bailouts sucked and were evil...but they were not the fault of everyone in the business.**.  Bailouts took money from citizens by force and threat of force (more accurately from future generations) and gave it to people to buy mansions and yachts as a REWARD for failing with incredibly stupid decisions in buying sub-prime debt.  This is terrible.
*1) not all of us participated in the bailouts*.....in fact many of us were vocally against them, the bailouts benefited only a tiny number of those on the inside -- it's especially unfair to criticize members of the investment profession who received no benefit for something they were against *2) even having said that, lets be fair*....does PRIMARY blame really go to the bankers or to Congress who seized the money in the first place?   Do you know anyone who would turn down a huge check which could make themselves wealthy and save their business?  (By the way, some banks did not even want the bailout but were forced to accept it, look it up)

- **Most people on Wall St. understand QE and many are not fans of the Fed policy** - carful about lumping the Fed in with Wall St. yes, at the very very top levels it's closely connected....but we are talking about 20 people ....not the other one million of us who don't even work for those 20.

- **There are many very good and positive aspects of Wall St. like VCs** / if we are defining this as the investment business in general then ""Wall St."" includes venture capital firms (some of which are physically located on the street called Wall St., most of which are obviously not). -- VCs bring a good deal of talent and money to companies and they help them grow -- business is very complex these days and VCs are some of the smartest people around: they have the know how and connections to help Bitcoin companies get in the door at huge and valuable partners, avoid pitfalls, hire the right staff etc.

- **Later stage Wall Street provides additional capital to help industries mature**:  Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon etc. ALL went public using Wall St. and all saw a benefit of that being the next growth stage.

- **Some people on Wall St. actually know what they are doing** -- yes, there are scumbags and greedy people (not nearly as many as the movies like to portray) but in such a highly competitive business there are many really brilliant minds -- people who have excelled all their life and who work very hard and very smart -- they get new concepts and can indeed add value (some are fools of course)

- **Even the greedy don't see money as a zero sum game** - the most successful, even notoriously ruthless bankers really DO want to make those around them rich....taking the cynical view maybe they do it only because its good business....but nevertheless most (especially people like VCs and PE funds and hedge funds) want nothing more than to own a (big) chunk of your thing and make you the next Zuckerberg.

- **If Bitcoin is to grow it needs real capital and Wall St has that capital....right now every Bitcoin on planet earth is worth less than the clothing store for teenage girls called The Limited and it's worth less than 5% of Nestlé**.   I love Bitcoin and believe in it, but sorry, with those current small numbers is a FAR way from being the serious piece of global economy I and everyone who believes in it knows it can be...In order to even start to get there it needs 10, 20, 40 times it's current market cap.....getting to the $100-400 billion range.   At that rate one BTC is worth $10,000-40,000 and we are STILL not even as large as a top 20 company or even 1% of Internet transactions / a real currency.   TO GET these levels of capital, Bitcoin needs real investors, real commitments -- that means lots of participation from institutional investors who make Winkelvoss sized commitments.....ATMs and store POS adoption simply can't add up.

- **Increased trading and investment also stabilizes the price**-- traders trade on inefficiency -- the BTC markets are very inefficient right now -- as they grow and more investors, particularly large institutions participate then the price will grow and stabilize which means more merchants can accept without fear of wild swings.

- **Wall St. / institutional money has already helped Bitcoin a great deal** --- if you think that investment and growth in companies like Coinbase is a good thing and you are happier with a price of 700-900 versus 100-300 then part of that thanks goes to Wall St.  A huge amount of the growth last year was from institutional buying such as Winkelvoss and many OTC official and unofficial trades..... the number of early adopter economic techno geeks with over $1 mil is very small..... the mass of small investors just don't move the market like large ones. (10,000 $1000 people equals one $10 million person)

- **Bitcoin may change the world but it's extremely unlikely to obliterate old models without integrating with them first and changing them from within** --   *1). Disruptive technology typically changes and integrates old tech*-- some is killed off, most remains and adapts.   IBM changed its model many times, old print media generally changed to adapt to the Internet -- for Wall St. It will be the same.....if Bitcoin is globally transformative it may kill a Western Union or two,  it will create a few new Google sized companies and it will integrate with most old-school banks etc, transforming them --- old structures are too established to just disappear *2) for Bitcoin to have that kind of impact we are not just talking about the five year target of $100-400 billion that Winkelvoss (and me!) have.....we are talking about* several trillion and a price per BTC of $3-4 million --- that may happen, I hope it does....but to think it will happen in five years is overly optimistic I think.....and IF IT DOES go to $4 million per coin (especially somehow doing so my magically bypassing where all the capital resides) guess what?  Even at $4 million it STILL is not large enough to replace Wall St. ....it's about the size of the assets of one or two large banks, or about the market cap of the four largest companies....huge but still not the reset button on the world kind of huge.


**FAIR BALANCE:  the bad side of Wall Street**

Will Wall Street people lie to you and rob you?  Almost never....but **they WILL stick it to you and squeeze every penny they can from you** and, if your lawyer isn't smart enough to understand dilution clauses etc. they will whipsaw you.

**Wall Street in general doesn't get Bitcoin and doesn't care about it** some of us are very passionate believers, others see it as a quick buck and don't even care if it has a real future as long as they can make a buck.

Personally I'm looking at some Bitcoin related stuff and I plan not to deal with Wall Street much, by choice. ** I'd rather deal with Bitcoiners.  Not because Wall St. is full of bad guys but because so few ""get it"" yet.**  and I like both communities but I generally like the BTC community a bit more.


(Written by Bruce Fenton a Bitcoin fan who comes from a career in the investment business)


**TL: DR:**    Wall St. should be dealt with cautiously, offers many great advantages and is here to stay and will bring a net benefit to Bitcoin.  Be realistic about how things change and grow historically, even the most disruptive technologies our world has ever seen.",cryptocurrency,1389213038

personalfinance,"23m Renting and making it, but have collectors chomping at me.","I'm 23, live in Illinois (ouch), and rent my place for $825 starting in February (currently $990 for monthly/last months split into 5 payments). Utilities run from $125-$175 monthly and I have a car payment of $155 every month.

Take home pay after taxes is approximately $1550 depending on the month, shorter months a bit less.

I'm still young and spend some money on extra curriculars, but in a given month no more than $125 on booze/fun stuff.

My parents take care of car insurance/cable bills, but I've been going the last three years paying taxes and owing about $300 to federal and ~100 to the state. I don't know why that is, seeing as they take nearly $200 from my paychecks bi-weekly.

I had four teeth pulled about two years ago, and long story short ended up going to the emergency room, then back to the same dentist to sew it all up again, all in all costing me about $1200 dollars that I have just refused to pay seeing as he botched it in the first place.

But also have had some other dental work that wasn't covered through insurance with about $400 left on the balance as of November. I've been trying to pay this off but more often than not can't part with my emergency money to cover it.

Just today I got a letter from a lawyer/collection saying I owe over $1200 to the state and they are coming after me for it, whereas I thought whatever I owed they would just take from this year's tax return.

personalfinance,private loan default question,"Hoping this is a good place to ask:

Atop my many student loan repayment/underemployed issues, I have this one private loan on which I had been paying interest while still in school (from Chesla, originally managed by FirstMark Services, if that helps).

After I graduated, of course, the monthly payments increased from around $50 to $155. I'd been on top of both this and my federal loans until about a year after graduation (Feb 2011), when I was laid off from my job.

Most of my loaners understood and have been working to help me get back on my feet since then, but this private lender told me that since it was a private loan, they had no deferment/forebearance/etc. options for me, and essentially said ""Aww, poor you. We'll see your payment come next month.""

Since then, it's been a constant struggle to play catch-up on everything, but especially this private loan. As of this time last year, the loan has been in default.

Now, when one of my federal loans went into default (I'm working with them directly on recovery), I got a statement saying that I could dispute the validity of it going to collections. I'm not so worried about that one because the lenders themselves are working with me to recover payments.

But it made me wonder about the private loan, and if there was any possibility to dispute that one. Prior to collections, I had still been maintaining the minimum $155 every month, adding whatever extra I could when I could, so even though there's 6 months of ""back-payments"" I owed, I was still, in fact, making regular payments, and brought the 16k down to roughly 13k. Because of it being transferred to collections, however, it seems they added a $2k ""fee/coll cost"" to the balance, so all the time/money I put into paying it down basically equates to a waste at this point.

Is this a situation where I could have disputed, had I known it was an option? Is it too late, since such a dispute must be claimed within a certain time period?

I just want to get my finances under control. I've been trying hard to stand on my own two feet again since that layoff, and I feel overwhelmed by it all and resentful toward my toxic co-signers for not properly helping me figure out college funding in a reasonable/responsible way and instead stuck me with a bunch of debt that they legally agreed to help pay for by co-signing, but never had any intentions (or funds themselves) of actually doing so.

I need actual insight--from people NOT trying to force me to feel a constantly dependent financial need--to help me straighten things out. I'm trying to budget and save, but nothing ever feels like enough, and I hate not having money to build up any sort of savings or emergency funds for actual emergencies.",finance,1389218727
personalfinance,I dun goofed. I got a loan for a car beyond my means in 2012. I need to fix my mistake. Please help me. Mama drama inside (optional read).,"Hello all. Here's my story. I hate to say it, but I wish I didn't rely on my mom for big decisions like this. Skip the story if you want, the skinny is on the bottom, the part titled ""THE SKINNY"".

In 2012 I had just graduated from my undergraduate with a bachelor's in Env Science. I got a research assistantship for my master's. It was the first time I was getting steady income and despite my deep reservations (I almost walked out of the dealership because I felt it was a bad choice, but my mom stopped me) and against my better judgement, I followed my mom's guidance and bought a new car. I got an auto loan with maintenance. At the time it seemed like a good idea (after all, I was naive and had no idea on how to shop for my first car) so I let my mom 'guide' me .

I bought it under one condition: She promised me that she would help me with half of the monthly payments until I had a full time job after I graduate with my MS. I thought, okay maybe I can do this. I took her word for it. She is my mom, after all.

On top of that she said: ""I am doing this because I love you. You deserve to have a good working car. Used cars are a drain of money and look ugly"".

She helped during the first three months. After I got settled in school in a different state (I was with her during the first three months during summer break), the excuses came in. Oh I am short on money, I can't help this month. Oh grandma's meds cost a lot this month, so I can't help. Mind you, she just sold one of her houses and fully paid for a new condo (in cash) to move into. I thought, okay she just bought a condo and has to fix it up, maybe if I scrape by a little longer she will help me. She just had a divorce 2 years ago, maybe she is having a tough time adjusting.

Nope. The promised help didn't happen.

It's really hard to accept that someone like mom, who seemed like the epitome of financial savvy when I was growing up (I reasoned, well....she's a loan officer and supported me and my grandma as a single mother) has given me terrible financial advice.

**I am not blaming her for this mistake. This loan is my fault. It is my fault because I took bad advice. SO now I have to own up to my mistake.** 

TURNING POINT/AHA! MOMENT:
Fast forward to this past Christmas. I have become more responsible with my spending, and I have realized that having $1500 in your savings/chking account and paying for something that is 23% of your income (and this steady source will end in 6 months if I graduate and I don't find a job by the time I graduate) is not a good idea. I know, I am pretty slow. I have moved into a pretty cheap place (450-500 tops rent utilities and internet) for my second year that is more affordable for my income (last place was 650 for utilities+rent). I am not taking any classes this last semester, and I can easily go to campus on a bus in my new place. 

I told my mom ""hey I think given that I am graduating in 6 months and I can't guarantee I will have a job, maybe I should sell the car and save up to buy one within my means"". 

Her response: ""WHAT?! YOU WANT TO GIVE UP?!? YOU WANT TO BE A **LOSER!?**""

First gen-college student who is getting paid to do her M.S. is a loser...because she is okay with not having a car for a couple months to shop around for a cheaper one and to save money for after graduation.

 I said, ""no, you are wrong. It's about living within my means. I need to start saving money because I may have to move for a new job and to start life post grad"".

She then said that I am making her feel like a bad parent. She talked about how I would brag about my friend's parents getting them cars and their family trips to vacation houses (*note: I never DID!Gah!*) and would proceed to say that having debt is good, it pushes you to work harder.

I then reminded her that I have 28K in student loans (government, thank GOD) and she flipped out. ""Didn't I say that I was going to pay for those"" she contested.

And then I realized that I was played again, and I sang the same old song. She would always puts me through an emotional roller coaster and I somehow end up apologizing in the end.

Today I am not apologizing to her but to my past, present and future self. **I know that this is just a loan, but I feel as though this is an important step as a young adult for self-empowerment in my life. Most importantly, resolving this problem will be my first step in healing after growing up in an emotionally abusive household** 

Other notes:
i) She convinced me that lying about my income (she told me to tell the financing office that I made 25 K a year) was a good idea 

ii) Right after graduation, she tried to convince me to co-sign a mortgage. Glad I kept saying no (I have awesome friends). She said that I ""owe"" her because she made so many sacrifices for me. 

iii) She is about 30K in credit card debt, and is probably lying about it. 

She finally paid me back my $250 I lent her...and I asked if she can help with the car this month. Nope. Proceeds to tell me how she spent $600 fixing her BMW. OK fine It's her money, I just wished she hadn't made that broken promise in the first place. Oh well, I must move forward.

So here I am. I am not here for mom or dad, but I need someone that can give my some solid advice for the following:

**THE SKINNY**
I bought a new car outside of my means. What can I do for damage control?

Bank: Ally

Contract date:	06/09/2012

Scheduled payment amount:$340.67

Term :60

Payments remaining:42

Finance Charges paid (year-to-date):$0.00

Finance Charges paid (previous year): $746.53

Remaining balance: 13,046.90

Car Details

Mazda 3 White

Account type :	STD RETAIL FFPF

18500 miles

It was always taken cared of in the dealership. I used synthetic oil. It only has a couple of dings in the back. 

My Finances:

Income from December 29th to May 17th: $7,922.00

I will be given ~$2000 at the end of May as part of the deal of the TA-ship I did last semester. 

Rent:350-400 all utilities + rent in warm months, 450-500 all utilities + rent cold months

Cell phone: Don't have one

Car Insurance: Already paid.

Credit Cards: $1800 ( I am an impulsive buyer, but I am working on this. Most of the credit card is on food eating out and presents for family for Xmas)

I plan to apply to jobs this semester as I am completing my manuscript, but to be sure I want to save as much as I can. Moving back with my Mom would be bad. To put it simply, I don't like FL and she is just plain mean. 

Possible options, from googling:
1) Refinance the loan (smaller monthly payments)
2) Sell the car privately (KBB: 11-13000)
3)Sell to dealership (~$9000-9500)

Other questions:
Where can I go to see if credit cards have been opened in my name, or mortgages?
How do I file my taxes? My mom said that if I used her accountant she would have to put me as a dependant, but I told her to not claim me as a dependant this year. Even though I am a full-time student, I have an income. 

Second job? I have considered but I say no. I make enough to scrape by but my second job should be applying to jobs for life after graduation. My primary job is getting my Masters manuscripts done.

business,JP Morgan Chase Franklin and International Companies Blog: 2014 Financial Tips,"9 simple financial tips for 2014 and beyond

Happy 2014, Foolish readers.

I trust you had a wonderful investing year in 2013. Given the S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 15.1%, its best year since the 30.9% rally in 2009, it should have been a good one for you. It certainly was for me.

Looking ahead to 2014, with interest rates still at historically low levels, many fund managers are again tipping a year of good gains.
As quoted in The Australian Financial Review, Legg Mason chief investment officer Reece Birtles said…
“… the local market is still trading of an average price-earnings ratio of 14.5 times which is quite attractive… Especially when you consider that on average the S&amp;P/ASX 200 benchmark index is still delivering a fully franked dividend yield of about 6.3%, compared to average returns of 2.6% from cash and 4.2% from bonds.

So domestic equities still look like good value as compared to other asset classes.”
In 2014, having just added another ASX small cap to my portfolio, I’ll continue to put money to work in the market, whilst also keeping a decent cash buffer so I can take advantage of those inevitable market wobbles.

I’ve got my beady eyes on a couple of good prospects, and just as importantly, I’m keeping a close eye on the stocks already in my portfolio.
As I said before Christmas, I will make more investing mistakes in 2014, just like my Lynas (ASX: LYC) horror show.
Try as I might to avoid it, one or more of those future mistakes is likely sitting in my portfolio right now, staring me in the face.
Is this my portfolio’s big winner in 2014?

Hopefully it’s not Buru Energy (ASX: BRU), the company in late June I called “My stock for ‘the next great resources boom‘.
On Christmas Eve I wondered aloud whether Buru could be my portfolio’s big winner in 2014, and beyond.
Seems I might have been a few days early, given the stock jumped 8% on December 30th after a well received operational update. Still, I’ve no complaints — it doesn’t matter to me whether the gains came in December 2013, January 2014 or indeed January 2015. I’ll take them when they come, thank you very much.
Long-time readers will know Buru Energy was trading at around $1.20 when I first highlighted it in these pages. It closed out 2013 at $1.75, a very healthy 46% gain. I’m hopeful of another good year, although I’m also conscious that it’s never all plain sailing for unprofitable emerging oil producers.

9 Simple Financial Tips for 2014 and Beyond

“Boy, if only I had found you guys 20 or 30 years ago. I would be all set!”

I hear some variation of that comment all the time from members of our Motley Fool community. Sadly, we can’t turn back the clock and do things right. We can, however, teach the younger generation to avoid making our mistakes.

With that in mind, I created a handy, one-page financial checklist that will allow everyone to build their wealth over the long term. If you follow this simple advice, you’ll be on the road to financial freedom. Best of all, you’ll have no regrets in the future about your financial condition.
1. Pay yourself first.
That’s a fancy way of saying you need to get in the habit of saving a portion of your earnings early on in life. It’s probably the biggest single predictor of financial independence for you in the future.
2. Invest your savings smartly. 

(A) First, make sure you set aside about three to six months of living expenses. Keep it in cash for unexpected events.
(B) Consider salary sacrificing to your superannuation fund.

(C) If you still have money left, open a discount brokerage account and start making investments directly into individual shares.
3. Create a portfolio for all seasons. 

Your plan for portfolio allocation shouldn’t change with the investing environment. You will want a plan that you can stick to through thick and thin.
(A) A good rule of thumb for deciding what percent should be in stocks is to subtract your age from 110, the remainder should be in cash or bonds. If you’re 40 years old, that means you’d have 70% in stocks and 30% in cash or bonds. Depending on your individual tolerance for portfolio volatility, you may deviate from this rule, but it’s a good starting point.

(B) Only invest in stocks if you DO NOT need to touch that money for at least five years. If you need the money before, then you can opt for term deposits or just plain old cash.

(C) If you aren’t interested in managing your investments, consider choosing an index tracking fund.
(D) Avoid high-fee funds.
(E) High-yielding fully franked dividend stocks are good candidates for superannuation funds.

4. Be an educated shopper of financial services. 
Before acting on any advice ask your financial professional these two questions:
(A) How do they get paid for the advice they provide?
(B) Are they personally invested in whatever they’ve suggested?
If you’re uncomfortable with the answers to those two questions, seek help from someone else, preferably a fee-only financial advisor or from a referral from someone you respect.

5. Avoid McMansions. 
Don’t buy a home unless you plan to spend at least seven years in that area. And you don’t want to be house poor, so don’t mortgage yourself up so much that you don’t have any money left over to save, invest and spend each month.
6. Be responsible and check your beneficiaries. 
Make sure you have an up-to-date beneficiary listed on your superannuation.

7. Spend a few hundred bucks on these three important documents.
If you’re an adult with substantial savings, you need to have a professional draft these two documents. These are really important, so we don’t recommend using an online form:
(A) A will.
(B) An enduring power of attorney.
8. Start your own business early in life. 
This may seem like an odd suggestion. The reality is that most people will learn far more about life and investing if they’ve operated their own business. It doesn’t need to be a huge financial success in order for you to learn a set of skills that will benefit you for a lifetime.
9. Create a diversified, self-reflective portfolio.

(A) A basic portfolio should contain somewhere around 15 to 25 positions. We like the idea of buying in thirds. If a full position is 6% of your portfolio, you’ll buy 2% at a time. Be sure to keep your trading costs below 2%.
(B) Consider 10% as the maximum position size when buying a stock. And no more than 30% of your portfolio should be in a single sector.
(C) Your portfolio should say something about you. A great place to search for potential investments is to track where you like to spend your discretionary money.

A new year is a great time for all of us to get our financial houses in order. Hopefully, the above list provides some helpful guidance. Here’s to a safe and prosperous 2014. Happy investing!",finance,1389247045

I'm a reddit member for sometime now but I just created a new reddit account for this post because I don't want my close family to found out yet that I'm a scamming victim.

2 days ago a guy contacted me trough IRC with an ebay link to a miner: http://www.ebay.com/itm/251420125784 Since I was looking for a miner sometime now (and he might had seen that in some IRC chat) we talked. He said he was the owner of the rig and wanted to sell it. But he preferred to sell it to someone on IRC / the existing bitcoin community. We worked out the details and he mailed me a signed document with the terms we both agreed on and Pennsylvania drivers license trough e-mail. Then I printed the document, signed it and resend my ID. His story matched with everything I asked (about his rental apartment for example etc). I had a good feeling about the transaction and I paid 2 BTC (minus fee) to: 18TWdJKYwYAMLEyFW2P5UZ2jU9uY7mnKeU

After 2 confirmations the guy said he was off to FedEx to mail me the miner. One hour half later I received a track &amp; trace number that isnt working on the FedEx site for 2 days now (trackingnumber: 421892541792113). 

I mailed him yesterday with the question why the trackingnumber didnt show up yet and he actually responded with mail trough his iPhone: ""It may take a few hours before it shows up in their system. It's normal"".

But now I don't hear anything anymore from him. 

I paid 2 BTC in front and would pay the rest on reception. I really can't miss the money but I thought it was a good short-term investment because I thought I could earn it back easy within a month. The problem now is I lost my 2 BTC and really need it for my mortgage since I just bought a new house (moving in in 2 months). I will get in serious problems now because of this...

After investigation further I noticed (afterwards) the user was connected trough VPN on IRC.
ip: 128.97.228.106
host: vpn-128-97-228-106.host.ucla.edu

His nickname is MrBlaine and the 'real name' he used is Aaron Blaine. I tried sending the eBay seller a message but he isn't responding.

Bitcoin,Huobi playing a very dangerous game - thoughts from a Chinese guy,"I am from mainland China. I thought I would offer my perspective to the English-speaking world regarding the rise of Huobi and how I see things going in the future.

Recently, the trading volume of bitcoin in www.Huobi.com has passed the 100k gate. On Jan 9th, the 24 hours volume is 145615, which is three times more than okcoin and ten times more than that of btcchina (฿13,780). If these numbers are true, Huobi accounts for more than 60% of all trading volume. Let's assume it is real. How could Huobi.com attract so much volume? I checked their site and discovered that Huobi.com is taking very risky methods to stimulate the transactions on their site.

First, Huobi.com asks registered users to remit/deposit money on the website owner's personal bank account if relevant users want to charge their account. This is to circumvent the regulation recently issued by the Chinese government which has banned any banks to provide banking services to bitcoin/or other crypto-currency business. So business bank accounts and 3rd party money service companies are not allowed to be involved in bitcoin trading. The purpose of this police is to prevent money laundering and capital flowing out the boarder. Using a personal bank account for this purpose is certainly illegitimate money-raising and will soon catch the policy-maker's eyes if the volume is big enough. I can imagine the mighty fist of the government will soon smash this site.

Secondly, Huobi.com allows users to borrow money/bitcoin at an astonishing interest (annualized 207.36% ). Such interest rate is surely against Chinese regulations. The law basically says interest rate should not be more than 4 times of the base interest rate of the central bank which ranges from 5.60% to 6.55 % for different maturity periods.

Both these two methods are extremely unconventional in Chinese culture and very risky too. The owner of the website is risking his career and even life. If the government noticed this site, the owner will probably be arrested for illegal fund raising. In fact, if the volume is true, I guess soon the site will be closed and owner will be thrown into the jail.",cryptocurrency,1389264964

personalfinance,Selling vehicle in an upside down situation.,"I owe about $18,750 on my minivan and it is worth about $16,250 - total liability difference would be $2500 that I would have to come up with. We do not have that kind of money right now.

My question is this - Do I sell the vehicle now and try to get a signature loan to continue paying on the rest or do I wait to sell the vehicle when the loan and value are closer together?

I've done a little figuring and have come up with this: If I wait until about May to sell the vehicle then the difference would be closer to around $1750 and that would be more manageable. We already pay $220 every two weeks and the monthly payment is supposed to be around $366 w/ an interest rate of 4.99%. I could have the $1750 paid within about 4 months. After that I could continue to save the $220 every two weeks and then after about 6 months of saving I would have a nice amount of money (approx. $2860) to get another vehicle that I would no longer be upside down. 

Is this something that would be possible or should I just keep the minivan for now and keep paying down the loan?

Bitcoin,Wrote this to explain Bitcoin's potential in a mostly neutral and easy to understand way. Comments and criticisms welcome,"Simply Bitcoin

Ponzi scheme, tulip bubble, no government backing, no intrinsic value, deflationary, too complex, and only used to buy illegal drugs are just a few of the buzz words/phrases produced by the mainstream media in reference to Bitcoin.  If what these news agencies say can be trusted, people’s first impression of Bitcoin should be skeptical.  But if one turns off their TV and does their own research, what will be found is an internet community dedicated to supporting what they claim to be the most revolutionary invention of our lifetime.  I have been following Bitcoin’s progress toward mass-adoption since March 2013 and what I have witnessed makes me comfortable to say that it could very well live up to these expectations.  I believe Bitcoin has the potential to have as large of an impact on our way of life as the invention of the automobile and the internet.  The automobile greatly freed the individual’s transfer of physical location, the internet freed the individual’s transfer of knowledge, and Bitcoin will free the individual’s transfer of wealth.  This will be a global revolution, it will shake up a lot of industries, and it will not be welcomed warmly by the status quo.

So what is Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is a five year old currency whose fundamental characteristics make it very unique compared to any other currency that has ever existed.  Bitcoin is the first successful implementation of a digital currency that has recently grabbed headlines as its exchange rate has exploded from $13 to over $1000 in 2013 alone.  Bitcoin is best described as cash for the internet because it can be transferred like physical cash, directly from one person to another, in varying amounts.  What makes Bitcoin different is it can be instantly sent anywhere the internet exists and each individual Bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal places.  Anyone with a device connected to the internet can essentially become their own bank by simply downloading a program that acts as their digital wallet.  Bitcoin’s next big difference is in its infrastructure and what makes it work.  Bitcoin is said to be decentralized because its payment system and the issuance of the currency are not governed by any single entity.  Instead, Bitcoin is managed by individuals who voluntarily use their computers to run the system as a network.  This allows transactions with Bitcoin to occur without the need of a trusted third party, e.g. VISA.  The final characteristic of Bitcoin is its limited supply. The rate at which new Bitcoins are created is set in digital stone meaning it can not be counterfeited and there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins total.  In order to fully understand why Bitcoin’s properties give it such potential, it is important to understand the properties of traditional payment systems.

The US Dollar, Euro, and Yen are the three most popular currencies in the world and are what I refer to as traditional payment systems.  These currencies are also known as fiat currencies.  Fiat means the currency is issued by an authoritative figure who declares it as a legal medium of exchange.  In the case of the US Dollar, this authoritative figure is the US government and its central bank, the Federal Reserve.  Fiat currencies have no intrinsic value but instead derive their value from the authoritative figure combined with the basic market forces of supply and demand.  The central bank has the ability to adjust the supply of fiat currencies and demand is produced by everyone who uses the currency to value things.  When supply of a fiat currency increases faster than demand, the currency experiences inflation which causes it to lose value and purchasing power.  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, the US Dollar has lost ~97% of its value due to inflation.  Many economists view Inflation as a feature of fiat currencies that encourages people to spend their money, rather than save.  Because of this, people tend to save their money in things that are protected from inflation.  One of these things that acts as a true store of value, free of supply manipulation, is gold.  People have used gold for thousands of years and give it value because its supply is limited, it can be stored without a trusted third party, it’s transportable, and it can be divided into almost any amount.  Sound familiar?  How valuable as a medium of exchange would gold be if it could be instantly transported across the planet?

This is where Bitcoin comes in.  With its gold and cash like properties, I believe Bitcoin has the potential to greatly disrupt the status quo of how value is exchanged and stored in our society.  The speed at which transactions occur over any distance and the fact that anyone can use Bitcoin means people can do international sales without having to deal with multitudes of different currencies.  Being divisible up to eight decimal places allows Bitcoin to be used for transactions of any size.  Being decentralized gives Bitcoin several advantages over traditional payment systems, both economically and politically.  The fee for all Bitcoin transactions is a fixed amount and it is orders of magnitude less than traditional fees that usually charge a percentage.  Having low fees incentivizes people to use Bitcoin since the money that would be used to pay the higher fees instead gets directly translated into either more profit for the seller or a cheaper price for the buyer.  Being decentralized also means Bitcoin will never “go down” since there is no one central point of failure.  The political bonus of this is that a government would not be able shut it down, even if they wanted to.  Bitcoin’s predetermined and limited supply means it can not be counterfeited by criminals and it allows Bitcoin to act as a store of value like gold.  These are the advantages that Bitcoin has over traditional payment systems.

Without even diving too far down the political rabbit hole, it is clear to see why I think Bitcoin will continue to grow into a mainstream currency and change our way of life.  Bitcoin is a currency that shines light on the fundamental characteristics of our fiat currencies and it will usher in a new age of value transfer.  An age where people will be free from the archaic financial institutions that are too big to fail and too big to jail.

investing,Emerging Markets in 2014,"I am trying to diversify my portfolio with an emerging markets ETF and wondering if this is really a good time to step in.

- There are quite some uncertainties/risks: FED tapering, Chinas economy, general liquidity and volatility
- On the other hand, most EM market indices are quite cheap (usually P/Es below 15)

So, to counter the risk of another year of declining stocks, I was thinking about an income oriented ETF.

As an European investor, I have selected some ETFs which are easily available to me:

- iShares Em Mkts Dividend UCITS ETF
- EGShares EM Dividend High Income ETF

Or should a general market index be more appropriate?
- FTSE Emerging Markets ETF

My horizon: 5-10 years and I hope for an annualised return of at least 5% over that period.",finance,1389291862

gaming,My Autogameography,"Just a few hours ago, I tried to answer a question asking about what has been the most emotional thing I experienced in a game. Not being able to choose a clear winner, I decided to just write down my autogameography.
(I thought I had made a new word there until I googled it)

The idea is to share my experience of games and see if it triggered any disputes, or similarities with other gamers, or even trigger some other autogameographies.

This is basically me, listing off things I distinctly remember about games in the my past (to date). A nostalgic trip for me and perhaps a few of you. Note: Many of my 'per-game' comments will only make sense for those who played the games. I've tried to somewhat organise the list. Also, instead of an exhaustive list, I've just called out the ones that I remember meaning something to me (as opposed to just being an enjoyable game).

(There may be 2 reasons why games are not here, A. I didn't play them. B. For me, they just didn't stand out)


Commander Keen - My first gaming memory (I think). Mind you, I have of course played older games since than.

Frontier Elite II - Manually docking into a spiraling station, finally trade profits and managing to actually kill a pirate. (I was quite young, so this was an achievement)

Homeworld 1 and 2 - What a great experience these games were, both offline and online

Eve Online - Many enjoyable memories, massive game. (Still playing)

Master of Orion II - Great ship configuration. For those interested, Gratuitous Space Battles (I think that's it) do a pretty good remake (if you could say that) of the combat side.

Command &amp; Conquer - Kane

Total Annihilation - Those Artillery buildings...

Age of Empires - The weeks spent designing levels, castles and scenarios

Star Craft 2 - An example of a well balanced game. Very few games have that feeling of ""anything can happen"" within the first 2-3 minutes of every online match.

DOTA 2 - I don't recall any game before where I don't mind replaying the same level over and over.

Wolfenstein 3D - Dual Miniguns

Doom - Rotten Tomatoes

Doom 2 - Serial linking two computers with hardest difficulty. 

Quake - ""You're not supposed to be here!""

Duke Nukem 3D - When the door slammed on your enemy, their guts would stick to it as it opened again.

Thief - ""Who.. the hell.. are... you?""

GoldenEye 007 - Facility, toilets.. proximity mines.

Half Life - The Black Mesa Research Facility

Unreal - Such an under-rated game.

Unreal tournament - Those blue balls

Battlefield (series) - For when you want to have gameplay options and not just the practical choice between and shotgun, a machinegun or a sniper rifle.

Battlezone - Would I be wrong in saying that this was the first single player version of Battlefield (but with resource management)? I doubt I'd be far off.

Dead Space - Terrifying... I think I just get too 'into' games and immerse too much for my own good. I taught me that for games, tension can be built up so nicely using light and noise and little else.

Mass Effect (series) - The last (controversial) 5-10 minutes doesn't bother me, I enjoyed the hours and hours of gameplay here. A great universe was built and enjoyed by many

Deus Ex : HR - A well designed game that combines great gameplay, art and music while having a story with substance. Another majorly under-rated game. ""the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long""

Bioshock - To me, is very similar to Deus Ex : HR in the way that it mixes gameplay, art and music in a great, memorable way.

Morrowind - This is how to immerse your player base.

Skyrim - This is how you continue to immerse your player base. (Bonus to this and Morrowind providing the ability to create mods. Teach a man to fish...)

Left 4 Dead - Nothing makes you love/hate your friends more.

Team Fortress 2 - Nothing makes you hate people you don't know more.

Theme Hospital - Bloaty Head.

Theme Park - Trapping people so that they p*ss and sh*t everywhere and can't escape. Still makes me chuckle.

Rollercoaster Tycoon - That addictive theme tune. (and, honourable mention, catapult rollercoasters)

Dungeon Keeper - Good guys keep interruptin' me

Simcity 2000 - Finally... after weeks, a city that isn't bankrupt

Civilisation II, The Test of Time - It's one of those games where you wonder... why did I even play that for so long?

Spore - Whatever you think about this game, few can argue that it certainly proves that your imagination is the only real limitation of game design. (That, and money/time)

GTA (series) - For me, these games have lead the way in showing us how to create open worlds. 

Baldur's Gate - Boo, the space hamster. Oh, and that first wizard outside the Friendlyarm Inn. What a w*nker!

Neverwinter Nights - Allowing for players to create their own worlds and servers and mods etc, is something quite special. I spent a lot of time with player created communities and worlds with years of fictional history. I'm pretty sure the people their knew more about the fictional history than actual history.

The Secret of Monkey Island - I was pretty young, so I remember just using a bash approach to get through those verbal fights.

Lemmings - Pure frustration as the stair case is short by one or two little steps.

Syndicate - After playing for a solid day without saving... I learnt lesson I have yet to forget.

The Sims (series) - It's the guilty pleasure for many people. For me, I just cheated and built the biggest place, then got bored super quick. Try again without the cheat, get bored doing it the hard way and cheat again. A vicious cycle! Although I didn't get hooked enough to buy expansion packs and micro transactions to acquire new items... it still taught me that there are plenty of people that enjoy pretending to have a virtual life. (be it shittier or better than reality). I did enjoy allowing sims to kill themselves. What does that say about me?

Commanche (Helicopter) - I remember being awarded an oddly early and significant promotion for running out of fuel but sending the other helicopters in the team back home to complete the mission, at this point, I assumed I had failed the mission, this was for a personal ""well I know I was right"" kind of victory. It recognised that I sacrificed myself for the mission. To this day, I'm still quite surprised of the code behind that, it was a very satisfying moment to be honest since it was so unexpected and the motivation behind my actions, wasn't to unlock something but I guess I was role-playing that of a commander and did what I thought was best for the sake of it. But what makes this important to me is that, I don't know of any games today that reward you for something similar to this, without some achievement available to you which hints you to act in a certain way. And today, if the game allowed such events to occur, it's spoon fed to the player, killing initiative (comment doesn't apply to all games obviously, but just the trend). Maybe someone can correct me here.

Forsaken - That level that warped into itself, it's quite tricky to describe, the level was a large sphere and inside the sphere was a smaller cube (hovering in the middle, not connected to any surface. You could fly around it and then into it (one open face), fly around some tunnels and emerge back into the sphere as if you were outside the sphere, and you're facing the cube you already entered again... see.. tricky to explain, but those who played know what I'm talking about. I hope.

Blast Chambers - The Frustration when my friend controlled the rotation switches and laughed for the entire round. Thinking about it still irritates me.

Ballistics - This (probably mostly unknown) game was the fastest racing game I played.

Mario Kart - That cursed blue shell and the times people would physically knock controllers out of their opponents hands. I'm perhaps guilty of that.

Super Meat Boy - It takes quite a skill to make the player enjoy losing.

Worms - Throwing grenades like a pro.

If you got this far and agreed or more interestingly, strongly disagreed, let me know. Thanks for reading.To end, I suppose I should reach back into my mind and choose a wildcard game....

Halo - It's a wild card for me because it's similar to Call of Duty where it thinks it's sh*t don't stink. Before you attack, I say that because they treat the image of their relative games like a franchise rather than focusing on the game itself (like Bethesda I feel). If you get my drift... But the ONLY reason I chose this game was for the co-op. Not quite the dependable interaction of left 4 dead, but when I play co-op and return to single-player, it's just not quite as fun. It made me think that every ""single-player"" FPS should have a co-op mode. Hmmmm co-op Desu Ex : HR...",technology,1389294332

personalfinance,"$180,000 student loan debt. I need some serious consult.","Long post here, I'm just going to spill it all out and try to be as organized as possible with my thoughts. 

**About me:**

* 27 years old : Still living with parents.
* Single
* Went to 2 ""for profit"" colleges getting a useless associates and a 3D art bachelors.
* Moved out of state for 2nd college, and lived entirely off of loans for 3ish years.
* Over those 3-5 years, the gaming / film industry has started seeing corruption in outsourcing majority of their jobs across seas. Rendering me with a useless degree until my skills are at godsend level or I get really lucky while networking. (Don't ask to see my portfolio, I'm going to get enough shit from my bad financial decisions to get shat on more on my work)
* It's been roughly 2 years since I graduated, spending about 10 months unemployed and looking for work.
* I work at a job that's ""Somewhat"" related to my field making around $34,000/year. I also do part time 3rd shift at a job at a hospital making about $12 an hour. 
* I'm trying to find a 3rd source of income and I keep jumping around between ideas. Do I code an android app and hope for the best? Do I make funny youtube videos and hope for the best? Do I write a shitty book and hope for the best? I am constantly trying to learn new skills that could help me knock out a good portion of these loans. 


**My Debt**

Everything should be summed up in these screenshots. 

http://imgur.com/a/REz2Y

* The first 3 images are from Sallie Mae and the last is from Wells Fargo.
* As you can see, a majority of these loans are private. 
* I'd really like to know what is going on with all these different little interest rates for little loans on the Sallie Mae side. 
* As you can see, it is literally impossible for me to make even reach a minimum payment. 
* My parents Co-Signed most of my way through these loans. 
* I'm not in default status, but at one point I have received a threat letter for almost being set in default. My parents once again came and saved the day and made a generous donation to them.

**My Bills**

* About $330 / month on my leased car
* About $100 / month on car insurance
* I currently have no health insurance, I NEED to get it by march though due to the ""affordable"" health care act.
* About $50 / month on phone
* About $150 for gas &amp; random expenses
* The rest of what I got is split evenly among Sallie Mae and Wells Fargo, maybe $500 each a month?
* I'm obviously not reaching the minimum payments required by them, but I'm literally clearing out my bank account monthly to these companies in good faith to show that I'm at least making an attempt.


**Yes, I get it**

* I'm dumb for spending so much on an art degree
* I should move out of the country
* My parents should be ashamed of me for dragging them into this hell with me.
* I suck at budgeting 
* Death is the only way out

I've contemplated suicide too many times over this, so I guess that's a plan B. I just want serious, constructive feedback on what I can do to start tackling this monster. I've been in very high spirits the past month and I'm motivated to come to a reasonable solution. I knew right from the beginning that I would be in a lot of debt, I think I am just running in horrible luck as far as the job market goes. I'm working on that. 

**Future Plans**

* I want to get a cheap apartment, being 27 and single for over 6 years because of this ordeal is chipping away at my sanity.
* I want to save
* That's basically it, I can worry about my retirement plan later in my 30's or 40's.....I have to....


**Options I'm Considering**

* Consolidation - This may not be an option for me, I think it's mainly for federal loans and not private. I also believe that consolidating would require me to take out another loan, requiring a co-sign again. I do not wish to dig my parents in the hole more than I already have.
* Bankruptcy - I don't know enough about how this works, I think I would need to speak to a lawyer.
* Repayment change - I considered this, but I figure that this would double my overall balance by the time its done.
* Deferment due to economic hardship - This just delays the inevitable.
* Forbearance - This I believe would require me to bring the balance to current, which is kind of impossible for me at the moment. Again, this just delays the inevitable. 
* Income Based Repayment - If I do this with Sallie Mae, I'd have to do the same with Wells Fargo separately, I'd imagine that to still take up as much money as it does now with what I pay (shrug).


I wish I never went to college. I'd rather be broke than be in debt. It's already said and done though, so I'm ambitious to find out what I can do to both please my needs, and the needs of the puppet master.

Thank you for reading my sob ass story, and thank you in advance for your advice. :)


**Edit:** I'd like to add to the ""I get it"" portion. I get it, I'm spending too much on my car. Just add that to my list of dumb mistakes to which I'm now aware of and will remember this rude awakening I got from you guys to buy used. My main reason for this post is to try and get options on how to deal with these loan companies so I don't end up dying a debt slave. Apparently Income Based Repayment is only for federal loans, and that only takes up about 1/4 of my total loans, what can I do about the rest?

**Edit:** I'm trying to respond to each of you guys, I didn't know this post would blow up to this extent lol. Thank you all so much for all of your input, I'm so grateful I discovered this website because my solo research on this matter has been quite slow. You guys are so awesome!

Lots of questions.","So I am basically just starting my life of being financially dependent, and I am excited but also kind of scared. I have been trying to educate myself on the world of finances but I have a handful of questions and I am hoping some kind people out there might be able to point me in the right directions.

I have $18,000 that has been in my parents' joint savings account to accrue more interest for several years. I am planning to take this and put it into accounts under my name. I'd like some advice on how to most wisely invest this nice little start-up sum.

I will owe my university just under 30K and I will not need to start paying until 6 months after I graduate. I do not have any other debt. Can I or should I start paying before then? I am planning to pay this back with a standard repayment plan of about $300/month.

I currently have a checking account (~$1000) and saving account ($100) with Bank of America. From my $18,000 I am thinking of putting at least $5,000 in my savings account and the rest in my checking account, although I'd like to invest some of it. I am debating switching to a more internationally friendly bank as I am not planning to stay in the US for very long after I graduate. I am also toying with the idea of moving that money to a credit union. My reasoning is that I would have a checking and saving account with one big international bank that would be my main bank, as well as some savings locked up in a credit union with a high interest rate. Is this a good idea?

I am planning to move to South Korea to teach English after I graduate, where average jobs typically pay about $2,000/month with room and board covered. I foresee my monthly budget being something like this:

$2000

$300: college loans

$1000: savings

$700: food, traveling, fun things, investing


My next questions are about the investing...

I'd like to start investing in a retirement fund. What would be a good choice for someone like me with a decent amount of saving but relatively low income? Also how would this work while living abroad?

I'd also like to start investing a percentage of my income in stocks &amp; bonds but I really have no idea where to begin. I would like to get myself set up with a job, savings, and retirement investments before I start worrying about these investments.

personalfinance,"33 yr old, new career, new start - but where? (LONG)","Hey guys, I've been a lurker for a long time but decided it's time to lay my info out on the table and ask for direction on how to start forming responsible financial habits now that I have my head above water for the first time in ages.  There are many reasons I am posting – for this post, I would very much appreciate any  advice in starting an appropriate budget that would allow me to begin building an emergency fund and paying off my student loans in the most advantageous manner, as well as possibly beginning to rebuild my credit. 

**THANK YOU IN ADVANCE for taking the time to read all of this! You guys are great.**

I am 33 years old, unmarried, with no children and no pets.  
In late 2006/early 2007, a series of personal life disasters (ended relationship, job loss) turned into me juggling late payments to many accounts (credit, utility, etc).  Eventually, I ended up closing all of my credit card accounts in order to arrange payment plans (I know it’s better to leave accounts open, but I felt stuck.)  **I no longer have any credit card debt.**

I was a homeowner for almost 10 years and, when accepted into my degree program, dropped my hours at work and moved into a house with friends in September of 2011.  I moved because it would be impossible to both carry full time work hours and full time school hours (as required by my program), so  I made a (very) tough decision to stop making mortgage payments altogether and put the house on the market.  In February of 2013, just 4 months before graduating, I finally closed a short sale on my house.  **I have no associated debt remaining with my old house.**

I have had my (used) car for about 10 years.  It is about 15 years old and thus far, pretty reliable.  I do not know crap about cars, and as much as I love the *idea* of a shiny new thing, I plan to drive it into the ground.  **I do not owe any money on my car.**

**My total student loan debt is $25,838.01. ** 

It is comprised of three separate loans, all of which are already set to begin auto-pay from my checking account in mid-February.
1)	 Direct Loan Stafford – Subsidized
Principal balance: $4,500
Interest rate: 4.5%
Monthly minimum payment:  $46.80

2)	 Direct Loan Stafford – Subsidized
	Principal balance: $8,000
	Interest rate: 3.4%
	Monthly payment:   $79.70

3)	 Direct Loan Stafford – Unsubsidized
Principal balance:  $12,000
Interest rate:  6.8%
Monthly payment:  152.34

**Total monthly student loan payment(s):  278.84**

Now that I have finished school and started a career in my new field, I have gone from making about $16/hr to about $35/hr.  I work 4 days a week, and bring home approximately $3000/month after taxes.    I have JUST started depositing 10% of my paychecks into my savings, and am already contributing to retirement and an HSA (had a mentor at work help me choose these plans; no access to info on them at this moment – please let me know if you have questions; I would be happy to answer them).

I currently have **$970 in my checking account** and **$595 in my “silver money market” savings account** and get paid every two weeks.

**My rent is** $840/month starting in March (**$1100/month** until then, as a security deposit is being split between Dec, Jan and Feb). 

My (first and only) **electric bill was $120**. I am expecting this bill to be one of/the highest of the year.

I do not pay for cable or internet.

I foolishly sprung for a shiny new phone with my first “real” paycheck, and am locked into a contract with a **phone bill of about $115 a month.**

I pay **$78.50/month in car insurance.**
 
I spend approximately **$60/month on gas.**

I have a **gym membership**  that costs **$25/month.**

My spending for food/groceries varies WILDLY.  I have gone overboard consistently in the past with going out to eat, etc as a “treat”/way to spend time with my boyfriend alone (we both had roommates for the last two years).  I have recently been trying to stock my kitchen well so that I don’t have excuses to go out to eat.  This has been quite expensive.  I am unsure of an appropriate food budget for the month – seriously, clueless.  Because I’m stocking up my kitchen, I think any money I would have been “saving” from drastically cutting down on dining out has been negated, as I probably spend around $120/week, at least, on food.  That’s about $480/month.  Holy crap, that’s ridiculous.  

For February, these “fixed income/expenses” will work out to:
IN:  $3000
OUT:   Without including an auto 10% to savings or any amt to food 
	Student Loans: 280
	Rent:  1100
	Electric:  120
	Phone:  115
	Car ins:  80
	Gas:  60
	Gym:  25

Leaving my total expenditures at approximately $1780.

**$3000 in - $1780 out = $1220 of wiggle room.**

1) we will have to sell 50% of our IBM stock to use as a down payment 

2) we will have to pay fees/tax on the money from IBM stock

3) the final monthly cost will be $150 less than what we pay in rent (not taking into account the future increase in rent)

4) the house is in fairly good condition, no major problems

5) the neighborhood where the house is located is an up-and-coming part of the city, a lot of renovation is being done in the area (we currently live in this neighborhood and love it. not many houses go on sale in this area in our price range)

6) we have been pre-approved and got good interest rate

7) we will only be in the area for about 3 more years (This is our biggest concern)

8) either sell the house when we leave the city OR rent it out for additional income

9) we make a steady income and i just got a promotion!

10) we are scared to make the next step and are not sure if it is worth it or if we should just keep renting

personalfinance,SOL On Debt; Can I Buy A House?,"PHEW!  Took me a while to get the courage to type all of this.  I'm not proud of my financial status but there is nothing I can do about the past so I need to look to you all for advice.

To start, my family is a total blue collar family.  My dad worked seven days a week but never made the most sound financial decisions so we have always been what I would consider broke.  I have had to work since I was young to provide myself with things any kid wants beyond the basic needs (food, shelter, clothes, etc).

I did well in high school but not well enough to earn a scholarship but still decided to go to college.  While in college, I racked up about $55k in student loan debt between federal loans and private loans.

Also while in college, my family experienced some financial hardships which required me to ""buy"" our family's home off of my dad in order to refinance it essentially at a better rate than my father would have had because he always had bad credit.  So now I have a house with about $70k mortgage worth roughly $160k.  During this time of financial hardship, I also was forced to rack up a ton of credit card debt for my family and eventually filed for the dreaded bankruptcy.

In hindsight I realize I should have searched for other solutions but I was so bothered by the creditors calling and threatening my family that I just took the easy way out.  On top of everything, when I graduated college with a good amount of experience and good grades from a good school with a good degree; I couldn't find a job because of the recession.  

Fast forward a few years.  I now make over $80k and have a very promising career with a great Fortune 500 company.  Also, I found out that some of the debt that I had from the personal student loans is beyond the statute of limitations.

TL;DR SUMMARY
- $80k salary ($4500/month)
- $70k mortgage on a house worth about $160k (taxes/insurance/mortgage is $800/month)
- $27k low interest federal student loans ($300/month)
- Bankruptcy
- Private Student Loans beyond SOL (but still on my credit report)

But now I need another house and plan to put about $70k down payment.  Is this possible?  Sorry if I didn't follow the appropriate format for these questions.  This is my first post.

EDIT
I also forgot to ask; is it better to settle with my private student loan company to have that removed from my credit report or should I keep that money to be used on a down payment?",finance,1389366990

personalfinance,"Please for the love of god, help me with my car loan.","Okay folks this is a long story so please read it, if it just comes down to ""unfair"" then my back is against the wall, if there is ANYTHING i can do PLEASE HELP ME. okay here we go:

2 years ago, I was going through a divorce, my car at the time had 185K miles on it, and was dieing. The heads were bad, was the main thing, oil burning, etc. Before the divorce I was 15k in debt already from sending my now ex wife to a rehab for her alcohol abuse, which my health insurance did not cover.

So I was screwed, i was living in an apartment still under a lease, paying other bills, and if I didn't get car I would be fucked. I had no savings due to my ex not working for years, so I was basically living pay check to pay check.

So what happened was my credit score was in the shitter, and I went to a dealer for a car to try to get a low loan. I was there for SEVEN HOURS, until NIGHT FALL looking for a car. They offered me this one car: a 2007 Hyunda, it had 15K miles on. The guy at the dealer called 14 different banks to approve me for a loan, the only one that approved me was Exeter Financing Corp.

Now folks remember: I was in a shitty place, I was depressed, I was in a psych ward for trying to kill myself, and wasn't thinking straight all, I even have the psych papers if you want proof of it. This was the loan:

$420.06 a month, 26% interest rate, and 6 years.

The guy at the loan company said ""don't worry about you will be able to refinance it after 2 years.""

Come to knowledge that, no one will take my loan because after 2 years the loan has devalued so much that I can't refinance it, and the Loan company I am with doesn't do refinancing. (again I was told by the dealer that they DO refinance.)

My girlfriend who has perfect credit tried co signing a refinance, with HER OWN BANK and they won't even take the loan. So I KNOW i am fucked.

SO basically, the cars worth now is about 8K dollars, I purchased it at 15K. So by the end of the loan I will be paying nearly 40K for a 7 year old car, that's only worth 8K, and was financed at 15k. It now has 50K miles on it because of me driving to and from work.

I am fucked, if I lose my job, or I miss even one payment I WILL get the car taken away from me, I am living in stress everyday from that stupid mistake I did.

I don't know what to do, this loan is destroying me mentally, and physically. I can't get a brake from it, What the hell do I do? I can't even pay over what I owe do to all my bills just making it each month with her.

I KNOW THIS sounds like a sob story. But I am in tears nearly every week from this, it's stressing me out, I don't know what to do. In the two years I have been paying for this EVERYTHING has gone toward interest. It's ridiculous, I am so desperate at this point I don't know what to do. I am throwing my money away that I nearly work 40-45 hours a week for.

On top of that the normal wear and tear on the car is GOING to catch up to it, and then I will be paying double for car parts, as I do most of my own car work, and the loan. WTF do I do THERE IS NO WAY that will be possible.

Please folks, I am asking for help and advice not to be yelled at.

My previous unsub loan interest was near 7% and sub near 4%. If you have been paying attention to the school loan interest rate, it has been going down. So I took out all my sub loan (3% this year)  and paid off unsub and some previous sub. This helped me save over 2k just over a couple years. It will save me even more until I pay off the loans.

personalfinance,Quick question from a recent grad(loans vs savings),"Hey r/personal finance, glad I found you, I have a quick question that I don't think is terribly difficult, just looking for some advice. 

So I just graduated from college and during college I had to deplete my savings. Now that I've graduated, I have an okay job that allows me to pay my bills and live comfortably for someone in their early twenties. Now that I have some extra money coming in, I was thinking about starting a new savings account, nothing major probably just going to throw 100 or 200 bucks a month in it so that I can have some sort of untouchable ""rainy day"" fund or something.

But then I got to thinking, wouldn't it be better in the long run to NOT do this and instead apply the extra 100 or 200 bucks to my student loan payment instead of saving?

I don't feel like figuring it out to future value in 2023 or whatever, but just thinking very basically, assume the average interest rate for a savings account is 4% and my loans interest is 10%, if I have $200 one month, wouldn't it be wiser to apply that to my loan principal saving approx $20 vs. putting it in savings and earning $8? Obviously its WAY more complicated than that, but cutting it down to the very basics, shouldn't I get out of debt BEFORE saving?

Is the best option maybe somewhere in the middle? Alternate one month to saving next month to loan? My other idea would be to aggressively put into savings and get it to about $2000 in 2 or 3 months and then just let it sit as emergency funds, that can also gain a bit of interest. And at that point focus all my extra income on repaying loans.

Bitcoin,"Your coins may be mined in Iceland, but the natives can’t touch them","**Some background:**

Iceland has had restrictive capital controls in place since the Icelandic banks failed in 2008. This means people cannot move capital out of the country, buy or hold foreign currencies such as dollars, or even invest in foreign assets. (http://redd.it/1t8zf3)

The Icelandic Central Bank (has an equivalent role to the Fed) has previously stated that it is illegal in its view to trade bitcoins.

The following is correspondence between me and legal counsel at the Central Bank [translated from Icelandic].

It basically boils down to this:

* Icelanders are not allowed to accept payment in bitcoin for goods or services provided.
* The Central Bank has not taken a position on whether Bitcoin is considered a currency according to the Foreign Exchange Act no. 87/1992. 
* The Central Bank does however not consider Bitcoin to be e-money [EU legal term] in the meaning of Act no. 17/2013.
* The Central Bank does not yet have a position on whether domestic parties can trade in bitcoin among themselves.
* Questions relating to Bitcoin are actively being examined within the bank.
So Icelanders trading in bitcoin with foreigners, or accepting bitcoin as payment, are subject to fines or up to two years’ imprisonment according to law.


**Correspondence with the Icelandic Central Bank:**

&gt; Good day,
&gt; 
&gt; I read a news article in Morgunblaðið the other day about bitcoin trading.
&gt; 
&gt; A few questions popped to my mind:
&gt; 
&gt; * What article banning capital movements and foreign exchange trading does the bank think applies to bitcoin trading?
&gt; * Does the bank consider bitcoin to be a foreign currency according to law?
&gt; * Does the bank consider bitcoin to be subject to mandatory submission to a financial institution, for example if goods or services are sold from a domestic entity to a foreign entity in exchange for bitcoin? [See Article 13 l below for clarification.]
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Friðrik Rossmann

&gt; Hello Friðrik.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the Icelandic Foreign Exchange Act general restrictions apply on foreign exchange trading and capital movements between countries. It does not appear that the provisions of the Act that exempt goods and services from the aforementioned restrictions can be applied to trading in Bitcoin or that other exemptions from restrictions of the Act apply to such transactions. In other words, it is the position of the Central Bank of Iceland that there is no authorization in place for buying foreign currency from a financial institution in this country or for the movement of foreign currency between countries, in relation to Bitcoin trading.
&gt; 
&gt; To my knowledge the Central Bank of Iceland has not taken an official or public position on whether BitCoin can be classified as a currency or e-money according to Act no. 17/2013. However it is the position of the Department of financial infrastructure at the bank that Bitcoin is likely not e-money according to that Act.
According to temporary provision II of the FX Act payments for the exporting of goods and services shall be made in foreign currency. It is the view of the Central Bank of Iceland that the mandatory submission rule of Article 13 l is breached if the proceeds of goods or services sold are received in Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; [CB lawyer]

&gt; Hello again.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to what I previously stated I should add that restrictions on capital movements are to be found in &gt; Article 13 b and restrictions on foreign exchange trade in Article 13 c.
&gt; 
&gt;  Regards,
&gt; [CB lawyer]

------

&gt; Hello.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for the reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I wrong in thinking that temporary provision II of the FX Act only states in what currency trade in goods and services shall be made? I.e. domestic currency or foreign currency?
&gt; 
&gt; The purpose of the provision seems to have been to ban trade in Icelandic krónur, cf. the commentary in the legislative bill:
&gt; 
&gt; “The weakening of the exchange rate indicates that some exporters get paid for goods domestically with Icelandic krónur and that the buyer pays, either directly or through a proxy, in foreign currency to an entity outside of the country. Thus the effect of the foreign exchange rules are severely diminished.”
&gt; 
&gt; “About para. 1.
&gt; 
&gt; In this paragraph it is proposed that until November 30th 2010 transactions should be denominated in foreign currency on the export declaration. Up to now, people have had the discretion of what currency they do business. When listing the currency denominating the trade in the export declaration, the currency listed on the exporters’ bill of sale should be used although trade may not be denominated in Icelandic krónur. The article also stipulates that if it is not clear from the bill of sale which is the currency of the export transaction or if the transaction is conducted in local currency transaction shall be recorded in euros or U.S. dollars in the export declaration.”
&gt; 
&gt; Since bitcoin is not a currency according to law, how can this provision apply to it? You could hardly denominate the export price in bitcoins on the export declaration?
Is it the position of the bank that bartering is prohibited? For example if I sell Icelandic belts in exchange for Danish suspenders?
&gt; 
&gt; I am also curious in which rules govern bitcoin trading between domestic parties. Are domestic parties free to trade in bitcoin between themselves? I would like to draw attention to the fact that bitcoin can “come into existence” domestically and actually do so, there is for example a significant bitcoin “mining” operation in Reykjanesbær. The purpose of mining is to lend the computational power of computers to the bitcoin network in order to secure it and process transactions in exchange for “new” bitcoins and transaction fees from the bitcoin network.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;

&gt; Hello Friðrik.
&gt;

&gt; Thank you for the reply. It would be interesting to hear about the domestic parties, whether they can trade between themselves in bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I to understand that I am prohibited from providing internet related services from Iceland to foreign parties in exchange for Bitcoin (as Greenqloud think of doing)? Is there no way for me to do it and also meet the mandatory submission of foreign currency or the goals that you have with these restrictions?

personalfinance,"College Student.. Working on getting finances in order, but ... health insurance?? (Wall of text)","Hi there! I have been lurking on this sub for a while to get advice on getting my finances together/budget etc. This is my first post.. I'm not sure if I am in the right sub for this, but everyone here seems knowledgable and helpful, so I thought I would give it a shot! 

My background: 

* I am a 21 year old college student.  

* I am in my third year (took a year off and worked as a birth doula - no I do not have any money saved from this because it doesn't pay well and was more about the experience)

* I am currently married (yes, I married young. There were many reasons that factored into this)

* Up until the time I got married, my parents paid for everything.  I took out student loans my first two years, and after tuition was covered, the rest was essentially spending money for me. My parents paid for all of my rent, bills, textbooks, and gave me one of their credit cards to pay for groceries, gas, etc. 
I HATE that they did this. Yes, I understand that they didn't want me to have to worry about money, but I essentially LEARNED nothing about handling my finances because of this. My parents also are not good with finances, but think that they are because they can pay for things; they constantly want to give me advice and I honestly just take everything in a respectful manner and with a grain of salt. They live off of what I think is a trust fund, and they have never had to work, but my mother did for a few years before I was born, and then recently started working again to have something to do. 

* Despite never having to handle my own finances, I have been doing ok with them.  I don't have a ton of credit card debt, I don't spend money on things I don't need, I have been working on setting up a budget, etc. 

My current situation: 

* I am starting school next week. I received a grant and federal student loans, and have realized that I will not be able to live off of my student loans (like the majority of my friends do). I will need to get a part-time job. I plan to apply for scholarships, but these would not take effect until the fall 2014 semester. 

* My husband also came from a family that doesn't handle their finances well (&amp; actually thought it would be good for him to know what it's like to have his own debt like they do). He spent a few years out of high school taking out student loans and did not finish his degree. He also did not make good decisions that left him with a hefty amount of credit card debt. When I met him, he had been working full-time for a few years, trying to pay down his debt. This is a whole other story &amp; I have encouraged him to post here for advice. 

* Husband is also going back to school this semester, but is taking the majority of his classes online so he can work to pay off his credit card debt at the same time. He will be contributing to half of our bills/living expenses as well. He also received a grant and federal student loans. 

We have been putting together our budget, and we are essentially just going to be getting by for the next few months.  We will have very little extra money. I am planning on trying to build up my savings as much as I can, while we have agreed that any extra money my husband earns should be going to his credit card debt. 

We plan on moving into a cheaper apartment when our lease is up at the beginning of March. We will be closer to campus and I believe there are more job opportunities there than where we live now. 

**My main question is:** I have been looking at health insurance.. &amp; more and more, I am thinking it would be better to pay the fine next year at tax time than to get health insurance.  Am I wrong?  

I have never had to purchase health insurance before. My mom paid for me to have Aetna when I was in school (and I never used it).  When I got married, my husband was working at Trader Joe's, and I was put on his health insurance plan. He no longer works there anymore, however. 

I honestly don't really understand how health insurance works. I understand that you purchase it, and then have to pay yourself until you reach the deductible and then your insurance will start paying a percentage of your costs. &amp; if that is wrong, then I really understand nothing. 

Our school offers health insurance through Aetna, with a separate dental plan (13/14 Aetna Dental PPO) which costs $135 for each of us for spring semester.  The general plan would cost $1,500 each semester per person and doesn't include dental. 

My husband and I hardly ever get sick or need to go to the doctor. 
The two main health related worries are that we both need to get our wisdom teeth taken out, and we have decided my husband needs to go to therapy.  The wisdom teeth could wait (although my bottom two have broken the skin and I have gotten cavities because of this on one side).  

Therapy however... My husband needs this. He recently has gone no contact with his family.  There is a long history of substance abuse, neglect, manipulation. His mother has diagnosed borderline personality disorder, and we suspect his father has undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder (if you have ever been over in /r/raisedbynarcissists ... that's us).  We have worked through many issues together, but he has a lot to work on as far as communication, stress management, plus just a bunch of guilt and general bs that comes with going through what he's been through. We have really gone to the limit of what we can work on together, and he needs to see a professional.

Our school offers free counseling services, but their therapists are grad students who have very little or no experience ... and my husband has some deep issues that I think require someone who really understands BPD, NPD and trauma. I would be willing to try them, but I honestly think that my husband's issues are beyond what they can offer. 

We are currently looking for therapists who have experience with BPD/NPD and work on a sliding scale. Some of these therapists may take Aetna, but whoever we decide to try may not. Would it be better to just pay out of pocket, going as much as we could afford per month?

**Ok so after all of that..**

* Any general advice for finances would be appreciated.

* What should we do about health insurance? Is it even worth it for us?

* What are some other options that we may not have thought of as far as therapists/ dental?

I really am just feeling like I'm drowning, and I want to take hold of our situation before we really ARE drowning. We are going into this with no guidance and are just trying to figure it out, so please go easy on me! :)",finance,1389400477

Bitcoin,How to profit if you believe that ASICMINER's stock price will crash.,"Explanation: Asicminer has dropped a lot in value and now only makes up 1% of the network's hashrate. Some of you may believe that Asicminer is currently overvalued, and want to profit from an upcoming correction.

What you can do is short sell Asicminer. Shortselling stock involves borrowing stock, selling it, waiting for the price to fall, buying it back and keeping the money that's left as profit. To do this you need to have bitcoin as collateral.

These are the steps you have to follow:

Step 1:

Register at http://796.com. Deposit Bitcoin into your account. Please be aware, you will have an interest rate of 1% per week you will pay, and will pay a withdrawal fee of 0.30% when you're done. In other words, only bother to do this if you expect a large decline (10% or more I'd guesstimate) in a period of less than 4 weeks. 

Step 2:

Check the price of Asicminer by going to securities and clicking on Asicminer. The price is currently 0.0037 to sell a 1/100th share of a full Asicminer share. On Havelockinvestments in comparison, the price for a 1/100th share is currently 0.00310000	. This means that the share is currently about 20% overvalued on 796.com. There are multiple ways to profit from this. 

One way is arbitrage. Havelockinvestment shares can be converted into direct shares, and http://796.com will take over those shares and credit 100 of their passthrough shares to your name. There should be a delay of about one to two weeks, but this is outside the scope of this post, as we will focus on short selling.

Step 3:

Go to Financing and Margin Lending, click on Securities lending, and go to page 2 to find Asicminer. There are different periods that you can borrow, ranging from 1 week to 4 weeks. Rent is 1% per week. Upon borrowing, your Bitcoin balance is reduced, as part of the money is kept as collateral. The amount of collateral required differs greatly between different contracts, so if you find that you can borrow too little stock in a contract, pick another contract.

Step 4:

Important, you're not done yet! Go to securities and click on Asicminer again. Now sell your stock. You now receive more money in your balance again, which you will use at a later point to buy back your stock.

Step 5: (Optional)

Use the money you received from selling the stock short as collateral to borrow more Asicminer stock. This is not per definition as risky as it sounds. When you are planning on buying back your stock, you will first need to liquidate the contract you entered first. This will give you back your collateral, which you will use to buy back stock for your earlier entered contract, thus handing you back the rest of your collateral.

Step 6:

Go about your daily business and wait for the price to collapse.

Step 7:

Has the price gone down enough? Buy back and close your contract to get back your collateral. If the price went up instead of down, you will have to explain to your wife that your salary went to using virtual money invented by a Japanese guy to sell stock that you don't own of a company that solves mathematical problems on a website in China.

personalfinance,Looking for advice with our current financial situation,"This is a throwaway account because I’d rather not be identified by family that uses reddit.

My wife and I are looking for advice on our current financial situation.  We are both full-time college students starting next week and will be on a limited budget.  She’s returning after a year off, while I am returning after a 5 year break.

Currently our monthly expenses are more than what we can afford per month (using student loans).  So, we both need to get jobs.  Neither of us is currently working but once our lease is up at the beginning of March, we are planning on moving into a cheaper apartment complex and looking for part-time jobs in that area.  Our agreement is that each one of us pays half of our living expenses while we each pay off our respective debts separately.

In addition to moving into a cheaper apartment complex, we are looking for an apartment that does not have a gas bill.  We are also cancelling Comcast after this month (we will rely on University internet, free public Wi-Fi, and phone hotspots).  We’ve never had cable TV or a phone landline, only internet, through Comcast.  Virgin Mobile’s $35/month plan is the cheapest I have been able to find for a cellphone.  As far as groceries and household items, in large part we shop at Costco (wife has a household card for membership belonging to a family friend).

My wife and I have different goals for any money earned when we get jobs.  I want to use any extra money (after living expenses) earned from work to pay credit card debt.  My wife wants to put any extra money earned into savings.  

I learned awful spending habits from my parents and have been racking up debt since I got my first credit card years ago.  My current credit card debt is at $11,310.  I also have $25,674 in student loan debt.  I am planning on paying my Citi card off first (making minimum payments on everything else), then focusing on the NFCU card.  My loans are in deferment but I would like to get to a place where I could pay off the interest on them, maybe more.

My wife currently has $2367 in credit card debt, and $15,731 in student loan debt.  She is currently making more than the minimum payments on her Discover card.  Her parents however have agreed to pay her student loan debt (at least for now).  They are also paying for her car insurance and phone bill.

personalfinance,Wife's car - should we pay it off?,"I'm wondering if my wife and I should pay off her car. It is a 2006 Toyota Corolla  S with roughly 104,000 miles. It has zero issues and runs fine. She bought the car in January of 2009, and owes $4,000. The payment is $300 per month. Her interest rate is 11.5% (I know, she had poor credit back in the day).

As for our financial situation - I finished college with 0 debt thanks to some generous inheritance from my grandparents, and a full time job that paid for the majority of my schooling. 

My wife was not so lucky. She currently has her bachelors and masters - at the cost of a 104,000k student loan balance. We pay about $1,100 per month on these loans. The average interest rate of these loans is 6.63%.

We are both 28, almost 29. We have no children, and no credit card debt.

We currently have about 13k in savings, of which we contribute 1k per month to. We rent an apartment for $1,000 per month.

personalfinance,Require credit card companies to notify promotional interest changes close to actual date of change,"As per the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, banks must give customers 45-day notice of changes to terms of their cards, including interest rate increases. However, most banks do not follow this rule for the introductory promotional rates. These rates typically increase after a period of 12-, 15- or 18- months. Credit card companies notify customers of these terms when the account is opened. However, there is no notification closer to the actual date of interest rate increase which could be as much as 18 months later. Since the rate increase is part of the original account terms, this practice adheres to the word of the law. However, it is against the spirit of the law.

The least the banks could do is notify customers 30-45 days before the rate change. Ideally, the date on which the rate will increase should be constantly available on the card company's online portal and published in every monthly statement. Most banks do not do this today so that the interest rate increase sneaks up on customers and they get caught by surprise. There must be hundreds of thousands of customers who fall for this fairly regularly.

personalfinance,Should I touch emergency funds to pay off grad school loan,"Last year I decided to take out a student loan of $12k since I was doubling up in school load to graduate in Fall of 2013.

I was able to negotiate down my medical debt, pay a lot out of savings/emergency funds and currently owe $4400, with minimum payment of $200.


Now that I am done with grad school its time to repay my student loan and want some suggestion how to pay down my debt.


Emergency Funds: $30k in bank
I am not touching my Roth IRA, investments and 401k for debt payment.


Net Paycheck: $4083/month

 Medical - 4,400.00 - 0.00% ($200/month)

 Sallie Mae - 2,595.17 - 1.62% (undergrad) ($23/month)

 Best Buy - 800.00 - 0.00% (promotion) ($40/month)


I am thinking using $12.7k out of emergency funds and pay off grad school loan. Of course I will slowly recoup the $10k through tax returns (after contributing to Roth IRA) and try to slowly save. I have a very stable job and so far my mid year review got positive praise so I feel safe on security this year, 100% sure.

Honestly I never had a big school loan because I was fortunate to have scholarships, and good jobs to pay out of pocket. I do regret getting this loan but last year I did not want deal being broke paying double tuition cost (went part-time to full time) since I had a lot on my plate managing school and work, and in a way allowed me to have funding to pay my medical bills since I was put to collection due to incorrect address, this helped me negotiate my bill down :)

2) $12,000 Parent Plus loan
3) $72,000 Federal Loans

I currently am paying interest only on my private loan ($304 a month), $156 a month on my PLUS loan (on pace to be repayed in 8 more years), and $99 a month on my Federal Loans as I am on a IBR plan.

I started a new job in September where I am now making $38,500 a year, up from the $24,000 I was making before. This means my IBR will go up but I'm worried I won't be able to afford the increase. I also work a job that I believe falls under the public service forgiveness plan.

A couple questions:

1) It seems that there is no flexibility on private loans. Is there anything at all I can do to either pay less of what I owe or to stop the interest from accruing? It makes me sick that Im paying $304 a month and not making any ground at all.

2) Is there a number I can call or talk to who can walk me through the public service forgiveness plan as well as assuring that my monthly payments will be as low as possible? My federal loans are serviced through Sallie Mae and I'm not sure if calling them would help because they may not give me all the information I need.

I intend to purchase approximately 100 STY (S&amp;P 500) ETF shares in the near future. I'm however rather uneasy about the much talked about Fed tapering, mostly because I can't seem to find any place that would explain to me in layman terms what exactly it's all about, what effect it is likely to have on the stock market - index funds in particular, what the implications are, etc.

This lack of information tends to create a rather irrational fear of unknown in my mind, putting me in a position whereby I don't know what to do next?

Could someone who understands tapering explain to me what exactly it's all about, what it means and what it is likely to do to index funds.

Would I be wiser to put off buying SPY shares until later in the year, after the supposed tapering, or will it make no difference? Would I just miss out on a few months of being in the market and collecting dividends if I needlessly put the purchase off?

I'm wanting to increase my overall retirement savings rate, but I'm not sure if it makes sense to bump the 401k to the federal max or open an IRA and do a backdoor Roth (we aren't eligible for a direct Roth b/c of income limits). My gut tells me that the 401k is better because of the obvious up-front tax benefits, but I'm not sure if there's a benefit to the Roth (or traditional IRA) that I'm not considering.

personalfinance,"[UK] I have the cash to pay of my student debt early. Should pay it off, or am I right to hold onto the debt since it is low interest?","Please note, I am talking about student debts in the United Kingdom.

My student debt is currently sitting at £24,000.

I have the free cash in a current account to pay this off in full.

The interest is currently 1.5%. This is calculated based on the bank of England rate (currently 0.5%) plus 1%.

(interest may also be based on the rate of inflation. It is either the bank of England rate plus 1% **OR** the rate of inflation, whichever is lower)

The reason I am thinking of NOT paying off the debt is that in 2015 I may get a mortgage and i'd rather put the £24,000 towards paying off that, which will have a much higher interest rate.

To put it simply, although I don't need a loan right now, I think that keeping my £24,000 debt is good since I will never be able to get a 1.5% loan in the future.

In case if i've explained this badly, here's a quick example with numbers: if I need a £100,000 mortgage at 4% it will be better to keep this cash I have now and use it for the house thus only needing a £76,000 mortgage at 4% and keeping my £24,000 student debt at 1.5%.

This seems logical to me, but I just wanted to double check.

If it is right then what is the best thing to do with the £24,000 cash for now?

I guess the best thing is to put it in a savings account rather than have it in my current account where it is now. But I would want a savings account that I could get the money from easily and would pay at least 1.5% interest, covering the cost of the interest on the debt.

I spoke to Nationwide (who I have a current account with) and the savings accounts they offered only paid 1.5% or above if I locked the money away for 2+ years, which doesn't really help. Or they were fixed rate, which meant that if the Bank of England rate changed and thus my student debt changed, I would wind up making a loss.

So yeah, i've never really invested, I have a stocks and shares ISA which is doing well but I realise there is risk to that sort of thing so I don't really know what best to do with a large lump sum like this. Paying of my student debt seems the easiest solution, but it's probably not the best.",finance,1389472071
personalfinance,"26, taking time away from work, am I screwed?","I have a history of mental illness that peaked a few years ago while I was working a very demanding, unhealthy job. I quit that job and took another one, my dream job, which I still struggled with and had to quit after developing more mental health issues. I now feel I need to take an extended break from work, see a therapist and deal with my issues before working again. I have no idea how long it will take, but imagine it will be more than 6 months as my issues have not responded well to medication and the side effects end up being much worse than the cure.

The good news: 

- no debt except for ~$11,000 in federal student loans which I have received an adjustment for, so I am currently only paying $10 a month
- perfect credit
- I have $8,000 in savings
- I have a place to live, free food &amp; access to transportation as long as I need it
- free, excellent health insurance with very low copays, and therapy is free

So I dunno what I'm looking for exactly. Maybe some reassurance that I'm not totally fucked, or some advice for coping from somebody who's been in a similar situation. Or even advice about studying programming on my own and finding a career that way in the long term would be welcome. Anything at all. Thanks guys.",finance,1389476042

personalfinance,Should I get a credit card?,"I apologize if this seems like too common of a question, but the other threads I looked at were a bit overwhelming.

I am a 21 year old college student about to finish school in May. I plan on moving abroad in June to teach English in France. I currently do not have a job, nor have I ever had a credit card (thus, no credit score). I will most likely graduate with just under 14k in student loans. 

I was wondering if it would be beneficial for me to get a credit card. My primary bank account with all my savings (about 3k) is with my local federal credit union, although I also have a secondary account with Chase with minimal money in it.

But I'm not sure if I should go for these, or something by Chase, or not at all since I don't have a job (I would be using the CC to pay for what I use it now, so ideally I would pay it off with the money I normally use on debit).

Are they calculating the interest rate daily? hourly? by the minute? by the second? by the nano-second?  I can only assume it's for this reason that my calculation is off by a few cents.

Is this figure universally agreed upon?  Assuming tax-advantaged accounts are not yet maxed out, it seems to me that there are additional advantages to putting more into the IRA - reduction of MAGI via retirement contributions and longer time to deduct student loan interest (up to 2k per year).  10-yr return on VTSMX (or S+P500) is 7.8% (7.5%).

personalfinance,The real strategy to pay down debt,"So I often read there are two competing strategies for paying down debt.

1) Pay down the debt with the smallest balance first, which is the snowball method that is psychologically rewarding and keeps you motivated as you knock off debts one by one, but mathematically inferior to #2.

2) Pay down the debt with the highest interest rate, which reduces the interest the greatest in the short term, but monthly payments remain high and the benefits are really experienced more later on.

Anyways what I have not seen is option 3) which seems to be the truly mathematically superior option.  This option is to pay down debts where considering BOTH interest rate and REMAINING term on the loan. Even if your interest rate is low, if your term is long, then you are paying that low interest rate year after year on a balance that is very slowly decreasing.  Consider the example:

$10,000 balance

Loan 1) 5%, 10 years, total interest = $2,728

Loan 2) 10%, 5 years, total interest = $2,748

Loan 3) 7.5%, 10 years, total interest = $4,244

Notice #1 and #2 if you multiply loan by term, you end up with the same result and also the same total interest paid (within $20).  Now in this case I'd give the advantage to the lower interest rate because of inflation and so on....better to pay the exact same amount over a longer term.

But comparing #2 and #3 is where conventional wisdom goes out the window.  Conventional wisdom says you pay down #2 (10%), but #3 (7.5%) costs you $1,500 more in interest.  You should pay down #3 first.  With option #3 though the math is more complicated to get right, but I think it should be considered beyond simply what the annual interest rate is.

Am I wrong or why does nobody ever talk about the loan term?


EDIT: Ok I think the flaw in my logic has been exposed.  The total interest isn't relevant unless the entire loan is payed as scheduled.  In other words, Loan #2 is a better deal than Loan #3 if you are paying the minimum.",finance,1389493775
personalfinance,A bit short on funds for school next year - thoughts?,"Hey, personal financiers. I'm a nineteen-year-old freshman in college, majoring in computer science. My parents have recently announced that they're not willing to pay for any more of my education, since as a computer scientist, I'm _supposedly_ able to gainfully employ myself for the rest of my life without a degree. I can't get federal grants due to my parents' high income (they're spending a lot on repaying debts, and have a house that's way too expensive, but that's another story).

I have a student loan that will cover tuition and on-campus housing for the remainder of this school year. But, starting fall 2014, I'm on my own. I don't have to start paying off my portion of the loan ($5,500) until I graduate (2016 or 2017).

Thankfully, I've landed a Silicon Valley summer internship that'll pay around $19,000 before taxes, plus $1,200/month for living expenses. I crafted a spreadsheet that takes out the appropriate CA and US income tax, and combined with my $10/hr day job, I'm set to make $26,898 this year after taxes. This would be great, if I weren't in school. Taking into account rent ($11,520), tuition ($9,696), furniture, food, transportation, and repaying my student loan, I'm short about $4,000 for next school year.

I have about $1,200 in a Coverdell ESA that my parents set up for me ten years ago. From my research, there's no way I can contribute any more to the account now that I'm over age 18--is it safe to withdraw the funds and apply them toward my expenses?

Getting into more debt scares me, but assuming I can get a well-paying job after I graduate, it shouldn't be too hard to pay off. Of course, I'm going to apply to all the scholarships I possibly can before resorting to more loans. Is it wise to take out another student loan to cover the rest of my expenses?",finance,1389496851
personalfinance,"$10-12 k savings, Canadian student loan forgiveness for RNs, $40k gov loan, &amp; confusion around interest terms. Please help me! (CA)","This is my first post to reddit so be nice plz.. :)

When I graduate school in 1 year, I'll likely have ~$12,000 cash saved.
This is excess cash, I already have a $4,000 savings cushion for emergencies. (so $16,000 total) Side note: is 4k enough cash to keep on hand?

 I'll also have ~$40,000 in student loans (that's the total but they're at the same interest rate, payable in one payment that goes towards total balance - it's actually 2 loans, one provincial and one federal loan). It's roughly 2/3rds ($26,600) federal and 1/3rd ($13,400) provincial.

The loan interest is prime + 5% for fixed and prime + 2.5% for variable (so that's currently 8% and... something). I'm trying to inform myself about how interest works on loans, (like how often the interest is squished in with the principle of the loan, and new interest is calculated off that new balance... I don't even know what that's called). The information showed to me isn't really specific like that. There's just a ""loan repayment estimator"" on the gov website that says i'll pay $12,127.77 in total interest payable over the life of my loan, if i pay it off in 10 yrs, and $ 5,761.13 if I payed it off in 5 years (assuming equal monthly payments). I only calculated my federal loan, for the reason see the next paragraph. 

But as a future Registered Nurse, I'm eligible to have both my provincial and federal loans forgiven. The federal loan is forgiveness is $4,000 per year, for a maximum of 5 years (so maximum of $20,000 forgiveness in total). During this time, I'd only have to pay the interest on my Canadian portion. The provincial loan is forgiven at a rate of 33.3% per year (leaving a balance of $0 after 3 years). I wouldn't have to pay anything during the years for this. 

So I'm fairly certain I can land a job that will qualify me for both loan forgivenesses. Whether it will be casual, part time or full time is more up in the air. I'll work whatever job I can get and adjust my living and rent so I can to get by without going into debt over monthly expenses while out of school.

THE QUESTION - should I pay the $12,000 to my student loans directly after being done school? While working for the first 3-5 years, should I pay more than the minimum (just the interest on the federal loan)? Should I pay as much as possible? 

I'm leaning towards paying this dam thing off ASAP, because debt scares me, but idk. My mother is really the only one giving advice on the matter (but she has $50k consumer debt and is pretty much unemployed atm and has been under so, so much stress because of tight finances for my whole childhood pretty much. She thinks debt, esp. student debt is ok. But she can barely afford food, can't ever go on vacation, etc. I don't want to end up here.). 

I'm thinking so emotionally about this I can't even make a well thought out decision. I'm confused :( I wish I can more information on the specifics of the loan interest. Good thing is I have 1 year till I graduate to figure this out.",finance,1389503888

What does  Nicholas Nassim Taleb and Paul Krugman have in common? A tendency to make a lot of wrong predictions and not own up to them. Second, a moralist tendency to blame certain people (the 1%, bankers, Wall St., the fed, economists) for societies problems.  But mostly bad predictions and lots of them. 

The problem with moralizing is that if the empirical data doesn't agree then you're just falling victim to your own confirmation bias; this is bad for yourself and your readers. Another problem is that it leaves little grey area such as how much firm XYZ should be punished for taking a bailout Taleb mentions numerous times that bailout banks should forfeit bonuses and officers should be paid a 'civil servant' salary but he never specifies for how long. What if a bailed-out bank only took a tiny bailout and has reformed? When would it shed its scarlet letter.

If you watched the taleb videos his investment strategy boils down to buying stuff that benefits from disorder (like OTM options ) versus stuff that contingent upon remaining stable (long equities for example). Taleb's approach is to take many small bests in the hope one of them will payoff so that the loss of any one trade is very small. The problem is there is no evidence this is actually a viable trading strategy. Events like 1987 crash will never happen again and can be relegated as anomalies that can be discarded for all practical purposes.

dogecoin,I talked about DOGE and Cryptocurrencies for one of my education courses. WARNING - Wordy!,"This one's addressed to any social studies, mathematics, and computer technology people out there, but I'm sure there are a ton of ways to adapt this concept to be relevant in other content areas.

I recently  became interested in cryptocurrencies.  Anyone who even casually browses the internet or who keeps up with current events has likely heard of Bitcoin.  Though I do not own any Bitcoins, when I first heard of the idea, I was intrigued.  Bitcoin is a digital currency which some say exists as the internet's approximation of gold.  Anyone can use their computer's processing power to ""mine"" Bitcoin, though as time progressed, just like real gold, Bitcoins became more and more difficult to ""mine"".  To ""mine"" a Bitcoin is to have your computer solve a rather difficult math problem.  Over time the math problem becomes increasingly difficult, which allows Bitcoins to become more difficult to acquire over time, increasing their value.

When I first heard of Bitcoin, I was skeptical that it could ever become something truly valuable.  I thought of it much like the real estate bubble that led to the economic depression of the past several years.  I thought, ""People say this is worth something, but how can something that cannot be redeemed for something useful carry an intrinsic value?""  At one point, when Bitcoins were valued at $200 each, I half jokingly considered investing what little savings I had in the currency because I had seen it reach much higher values, crash, and rebound in the past.  I definitely regret my decision not to invest in Bitcoins as they are now valued at over $900 each.

The last weeks of December 2013 brought a new cryptocurrency.  It is called Dogecoin.  Apparently there is an internet meme based on a cute looking dog that some motivated people created a new form of currency themed around.  Its unofficial catch phrase goes something like, ""Such coin, very currency, wow!""  I knew nothing of the ""doge"" meme, but I was intrigued by a currency that was nearly identical to Bitcoin, yet highly accessible to anyone who wanted some.  Because, unlike Bitcoin, the currency was new and still relatively easy to ""mine"" when I became interested in it, I was able to use the CPU of my personal laptop to produce nearly 1000 DOGE over the course of several weeks.  How much is 1000 DOGE worth in USD? About 33 cents (which is far less value than the energy my processor used to produce them).  When Bitcoins came into existence they were nearly worthless because nobody accepted them.  Now it is possible to not only exchange Dogecoins for valuable Bitcoins, but many Dogecoin supporters have began accepting the currency for goods and services.

Learning about Dogecoin has taught me not only about cryptocurrencies but also about regular fiat currencies like the USD.  In my opinion, and barring any intervention from governments (like we saw when China more or less banned the use of Bitcoins, and when the US arrested the operator of the Silk Road, a website that took advantage of the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions to facilitate worldwide trade of illicit products up to and including heroin and murder-for-hire), these types of currencies are here to stay.  This is because of the fact that currencies derive their value from the people who adopt them... Despite the fact that Bitcoin has no governing body manipulating interest rates or adjusting for inflation like the Fed does with the USD, it has become clear that there is a strong demand for a decentralized currency that can be transferred quickly and anonymously between any two persons in the world with an internet connection. 

Though there are countless types of currencies in the world, US Dollars and the Euro are two of the world's favorite ways to express value.  In order for people to accept and trade in a given currency, people must not only be able to exchange goods and services for a certain amount of it, but they must also be able to exchange the currency for goods and services themselves with ease.  Bitcoin became valuable not only because of its built in rarity, but also the ease of its transmission.  Cryptocurrency transactions are generally much faster than standard ""ACH"" (Automated Clearing House) transactions that banks use to transfer funds from one account to another.  Instead of a centralized institution like a bank determining an individual's rights to a certain amount of digital currency, the entire network of computers participating in this great experiment provides validation for whether or not any particular user has any claim to a valuable ""solution"" to the Bitcoin algorithm and verifies when Bitcoins are transferred from one user to another. Though I do not own any Bitcoins, I could easily convert my Dogecoins to Bitcoins (though I would own a very small fraction of one), and with minimal effort I could convert those Bitcoins to US Dollars. 

Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which means that I do not need to go through a bank to transfer my valuable currency to another person.  I need only to know that person's ""wallet address"" and I can send them as many ""coins"" as I want.  Many banks charge a fee when a merchant accepts a transaction via credit or debit card.  Many merchants, most notably Overstock.com, are beginning to accept payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  Accepting cryptocurrencies not only allows transactions to be processed more rapidly, but also payments are received in a currency that has a higher level of liquidity than the USD, as transactions can be processed nearly instantaneously.

Bitcoin was introduced in 2009.  It took several years for it to reach mainstream status, but in that time, many early adopters became millionaires.  The value of Dogecoins is currently quite low, so it is difficult to view it as a serious investment, however one cannot predict the future.  To me, Dogecoin is simultaneously a satire and something real.  Accepting that a currency that was made up on a whim has real and tangible value really amounts to a huge leap of faith, but taking this leap has been strongly influential on my thoughts about US Dollars and other more widely accepted currencies.  The message I got from re-examining money in this way is that currencies are only as valuable as PEOPLE determine them to be based on what they can exchange them for. 

My interest in Dogecoin led me to join the online community, Reddit, which is the community where the cute picture of a Shiba Inu dog spawned a new form of currency.  Complete strangers walked me through the rather complicated process of setting up my computer to ""mine"" a digital coin that costs more to produce, due to the cost of electricity it takes for my computer to operate, than it is currently worth.  Currently, the most active sector of the Dogecoin market is ""tipping"" members of the community.  When someone posts something particularly insightful, useful, funny, or cathartic on Reddit, some Dogecoin enthusiasts ""tip"" them in Dogecoin.  When Bitcoin first came around, Reddit users would often ""tip"" one another by sending them these coins.  Today, a tip of a full Bitcoin would be a truly generous act, as giving someone a BTC would be the equivalent of nearly $1000.  Currently,  ""mining"" Bitcoins requires high end computing power, particularly the power possessed by top end graphics cards produced by companies such as NVidia and ATI.  Interestingly, as the value of Bitcoins rises, so do the prices of top of the line video cards - an annoyance to gamers who seek the slick, hyper-realistic look that using such hardware provides.

 Litecoin, like Dogecoin, is basically a copy of Bitcoin's concept with a few tweaks.  For example, if savvy miners discovered every Dogecoin possible, there would be over 100 billion in circulation.  However, the mathematics that provide rarity to Dogecoin make it so that as more coins enter circulation, new coins become increasingly difficult to acquire.  Though, when first conceived, Litecoin was expected to be just another fad with values similar to those currently held by Dogecoin, in the past few years its value has soared to nearly $25 per Litecoin.  In fact, many mining ""pools"", which are groups of people who combine their processing power, have progressed from mining Bitcoins, to mining Litecoins, to finally mining Dogecoins (which are then sold for Bitcoins which can be potentially exchanged for US Dollars).  Of course, most of these pools sell their Dogecoins for Bitcoins because they are the most liquid form of digital currency available, I can imagine marketplaces that deal in Dogecoins alone (as we speak, markets that exchange DOGE to USD and vice versa are developing and are having difficulty keeping up with demand) giving this currency,  based on a silly picture of a cute dog, tangible value. 


As far as classroom application, I don't think that it would take a computer genius to design and implement a ""Classcoin"" that students could ""mine"" or acquire using different methods, though it would certainly take a person more technologically savvy than myself.  Not only could students use processing power to generate new ""Classcoins"", but they could do things like trade them for extra points toward a test, develop services that other students might be interested in paying for such as tutoring.  Also, the teacher can ""mine"" ""Classcoins"" and distribute them to students for any number of reasons.  Instead of merely a process undertaken by a computer program, the system could be enhances so that students could be rewarded with increasing numbers of ""Classcoins"" because their classroom performance (grades, behavior, etc.) might directly correlate with the processor speed that their particular ""Classcoin"" mining program is capable of utilizing.  Due to the design of cryptocurrencies in general, students could develop and participate in markets that trade them, develop unique ways and fresh markets for buying and selling these currencies, and use them as a lens to examine the way that fiat currencies like the USD gain, lose, and maintain value.  If students mined and traded in a currency that is currenly relatively easy to ""mine"" with consumer hardware, such as Litecoin (which is considered by many to be the ""silver"" to Bitcoin's ""gold""), proceeds could be easily converted to USD and spent on rewards and supplies to benefit students (at least until school supply companies begin to accept cryptocurrencies - Overstock.com is planning to soon!).  Using cryptocurrencies makes it easy for parents and other interested parties to donate funds to schools, classrooms, teachers, and specials programs that directly benefit children without the need to interface with banks, checking accounts, or credit cards.

personalfinance,"The Emergency Account, Predicting Expenses, and The Month of Not Spending [warning: storytiem]","Last year was a series of finance and life mistakes and me not having a plan. I struggled a lot and eventually realized the following damaging notion was what was guiding my actions: ""I make X salary, therefore I **should** be able to have Y.""

I ""should"" be able to have a decent size apartment near down town. I ""should"" be able to have a nice car with the sport package. I ""should"" be able to go out eat and out to bars every week. I ""should"" be able to get a new flatscreen, have a sweet gaming computer I never use, buy people expensive xmas gifts, and go on vacation. After all, I make more than my parents' combined salary all by myself, and they have a house and a hobby farm and 4 cars and 3 kids and shop at Whole Foods.

Even the use of ""should"" implies some omnipotent, omniscient moral arbitrator that says engineers get to be middle class with a house and a car and a swimming pool. I already decided I don't believe in God a long time ago, so why is this worldview still so deeply rooted in my brain? I'm not any smarter or more deserving of this life than any starving kid in india, I just got a helluva lot more lucky with my birth circumstances and the opportunities presented to me. 

Time to start acting like it.

I had a wicked impulse amazon habit ($200 - $800 a month...). I *was* eating out every day at work, but fortunately my boss is the kind of person I got really sick of hanging out with on my lunch breaks 5 days a week which pushed me to stop that. I was driving 2 hours almost every weekend to go visit old friends (who do nothing but drink at house parties with townies) when all I wanted was to be outside in the hills. I had an addiction to my local chinese place. Every Friday (or after a particularly stressful work day), $23. Oh, and I had a weed habit to the tune of 150/month. At one point I picked up an REI membership and I was seeing this girl and the route to her house (an hour away) took me RIGHT past it. Man what an awesome weekend, go get laid and on the way back pick up a shiny new pair of crampons. For all that mountain climbing I'm not doing because I'm driving 2 hours to get drunk with people I don't actually like.

Anyway, I started to change all that because I was fat and unhappy. I got on a good lifting program and started training indoor rowing and rock climbing. This cleaned up my diet and had me bringing lunch every day. Restaurants simply couldn't provide the amount of protein I wanted in few enough calories (and dollars), I had already become a regular at every restaurant in a 15-minute radius so the food wasnt a treat to me any more, and I really couldn't stand another hour listening to my boss complain about his wife while eating greasy food that made me feel sleepy for the next 3 hours.

I finally really got on top of my spending and wrote out (in a real, actual spreadsheet) what I had been spending on. This is how I came to really grok the impact of the amazon habit, the weed, the eating out, the REI, the driving everywhere. I spent so much money, barely realized when I was doing it, and still wasn't happy.

I'm really paranoid about losing my job. Again, boss issues. I swear, the REST of the work environment is fantastic, but I got stuck with this guy as my supervisor. Luck of the draw, or maybe they matched us together because we were both fat goatee-men with unhealthy ways of dealing with stress. A match made in hell. I saw in him what I was destined to become (a fat, OLD goatee-man with unhealthy ways of dealing with stress), decided I really really didn't want that to be my life and that is probably why I dislike my boss so much now. I'm not gonna change jobs because in a year or two I'll be promoted and won't have to report to him.

Because of this, I am obsessed with the Emergency Fund. I can never have enough, and this pushed me to the idea of Financial Independence. That is like having an Emergency Fund big enough to sustain, well, a **lifetime** of unemployment.


So I've been at it about 6 months, with the eating well and the not smoking weed all the time and the fitness thing and the learning what in the world was going on with all these bank accounts that had my name on them.

Then Xmas hit just as I was trying not to spend. And it made me really look at shopping. So, apart from the gifts I bought, I havent bought anything but groceries in a month. I'm gonna go til the end of january and see how it affects me.

I want to set up a budget. The reason they have failed is because I could never predict my expenses, my categories would be all wrong, I didn't know how to predict my bills, and I couldnt SEE where the money was going. and I had no plan for any extra, other than i get to buy more useless shit on amazon.

So, I am embarking on a Month of No Spending. By paying ONLY my Bills (obligations I can't get out of), I'll be able to see how much I have left at the end of the month. then I can make an intelligent budget. Along the way, I'm attempting to predict how much I'll have left. If I'm right, it means I finally have a decent mental grip on my own money. If I'm wrong, I'm missing something.


It's alright so far. I've used up old beer to bring to a friend's place instead of buying a new 6 pack on the way. I've dealt with not having a pea coat and use my ski jacket (which I think looks ridiculous in an office, but I don't think engineers actually care. It's just me.) I've not bought any weed, just using a little bit here and there on weekends with friends, and I still have a bunch left over. I've not eaten out or driven anywhere except work and the grocery store.


There is a TON of shit I want to buy. I'm into ""extreme"" outdoor sports. Previously it was just backpacking but now I realize I have the skillset to get into alpine climbing. Which has a lot of gear costs. I want a real Squat Rack (~2-400 craigslist) which I am planning to get once I can hit a 315x3 squat. I want a lifting belt ($90) which I think will happen at a 405x3 deadlift. I need a few more clothes ($400) but these should last me a good long while. There's some kitchen tools I want and some climbing courses I want to take. My phone is on its last legs and will need to be replaced. And a document scanner would go a long way towards making this finance thing a lot easier. And I'll need a backup harddrive... and to rent a steam cleaner for my carpets (they are gross). And some soldering equipment because I want to sell stereos on ebay (my old hobby in college).

But before any of that happens, I need a budget. I need to figure out how much I can spend on ""fun"" while still meeting my savings goals for reaching Financial Independence.

If I can figure out my Fun budget, then I can know how long it will take me to save up for these things and I can prioritize them.

After my 401k contributions, health insurance, and tax withholding, I take home $1980 per paycheck (2 a month, and sometimes 3). This coming week all my bills hit, I should be left with about $800 after saving 650 to my emergency account. I get one more paycheck of 1980 and must pay rent out of it (750) and another 650 contribution to the savings account. This leaves me with a predicted $800 + (1980-750-650) = 580, which gets eaten by next month's student loan payments. so I'll have about 700 surplus dollars this month to budget.

**$700** All from just trying not to buy shit and spend money. For a MONTH. Think about it. I am.

what do I want to do with that 700?

Well, my ""Emergency Fund"" is strictly for job loss or some other nuclear problem. It's kind of like [""fuck you money""](http://jlcollinsnh.com/2011/06/06/why-you-need-f-you-money/), just not invested (yet) as I want a cash reserve. I think the standard Emergency Fund recommendation of 3-6 months has the intent of also covering other problems (car and home repair, for example). No. I want separate accounts for that. I want to be able to up and leave my job for 6 months and not have to change a thing (though I certainly would). So I have lots of ""emergency funds"" for different things.

- 6 months in the Unemployment Fund
- Auto Insurance Deductible Fund (keep my deductible on hand in cash)
- Health Insurance Deductible Fund (I have an HSA but want to use that as a retirement vehicle, so I want my deductible available in taxed cash)
- Auto Maintenance Fund - $500 plus a little for scheduled maintenance visits (the 100k tune up for example)
- next years Xmas gifts (I budget per family member and save that amount over the course of the year)
- Equipment repair - stuff like my computer, phone, or washing machine breaking down. also covers saving for a new phone every 3-4 years. I don't upgrade often and make them last as long as possible. The tech of 4 years ago still shows me emails and youtube, but the hardware literally starts to break from being in a pocket for that long.
- ""Funsies"" - the fund for that giant list of shit I want to buy

I have a current amount in each account, and a desired amount. Once the Desired Amount is reached, the savings rate towards that account can go towards something else, decreasing its timeframe. It's like the [avalanche debt paydown](http://www.unbury.me/) method, for my savings accounts. Instead of prioritizing by interest rate, I'm prioritizing by Risk of actually needing the money in that category.

Once all these funds are full, I'll increase my Funsies budget to something reasonable that supports my lifestyle and send the rest into maxing my 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, and then some savings for myself (property down payment, then FI investing).

I want to buy a piece of land for about 30k and live in a trailer to reduce my living expenses. Off the grid/homesteading has been something I've always wanted to try, and I'll probably start building my house on the property once things are in order (approaching FI predictably and my career stabilizes out).

personalfinance,Balance transfer - fee or reduced apr,"I recently made a large purchase to be used in my freelance work. At the time, I put it on the credit card I had been using for business expenses, though I knew that it didn't have the best interest rate.

Now I've received one of those convenience checks from another credit card that I have (which currently carries no balance) 

The option on the checks is to either transfer funds with a 3% transfer fee and no interest until July 2015 or no transfer fee with a 2.99% apr.

I have gigs scheduled through the end I 2014 that if all goes according to plan, I will have it paid off by the end of the year  from an equipment fee alone (not even tapping into what I'm earning from the gig, as I'm using that to build my emergency fund)

So my question is, which is better? By my guess, the no transfer fee with 2.99 apr seems like the better option but I am finding it hard to take that option over the other, which I think is psychological. I do worry that if for some reason this gig falls through, that the no interest would be better as it would give me time with no interest to figure it out.

For the record, it's not actually a huge amount, the transfer fee would be about 60, I just want to pay as little as possible obviously and have an idea going forward how to calculate this when needed.",finance,1389545453

I also have savings for 12 months of living expenses and a bunch of non-liquid investments such as a 401k I'm maxing out. Also my credit is pretty good.

I would simply pay off the student loans, except I'm considering buying my first home in the next couple years and due to some rewards cards I've opened more recently, my average age of revolving credit lines is only 2 yrs and 8 months, with the oldest being 5 yrs and 7 months.

I'm concerned that if I pay off my student loans in full, my average age of credit lines will go down even further. And since this has a non-trivial effect on my credit score, perhaps it's not the best course of action.

The loans average around 6% interest rate and there's an outstanding balance of ~$15k.

Is it worthwhile to pay those way down or off completely? I'm not really doing anything productive with my liquid savings so I feel a little dumb paying the 6% interest on those loans. On the other hand, the absence of those loans could have implications to my credit score.

Please critique my current financial standing and future plans.

**About me:**

* 23 years old, NO debt whatsoever.
* Recent college graduate – Engineering (2013), no student loans or anything, thanks Mom and Dad!
* Currently living at home with parents (paying them $200/month for basic expenses including food)
* Own a car with 160,000 miles (Worth approx. $5,000), still running great but planning on running it into the ground. Therefore I plan on purchasing a new car within 5 years, once the maintenance costs exceed the value of the car.
* Still on parents car insurance for $100/month


**Income/Accounts/Expenses:**

* Employed as of January 2014, making $50,000 gross, with overtime so realistically up to $60k depending on hours. 15 minute commute twice each day, fairly low gas usage.
* Savings (0.01% interest) and Checking accounts with Bank of America. Total cash = $5,000.
* Cash Rewards (1-3% cash back) Credit Card through BoA as well, I pay it off in full every month.
* I own 4 shares of Apple and 30 of LNCO in Etrade for a total of $3,000. I just play with stocks in this account, and have been doing this since 2007 in high school, making a little money here and there.
* I have opened a Roth IRA online through Etrade and have already put in the max $5,500 for 2013, currently zero for 2014. However, I have not yet invested in any ETFs/stocks/etc because I am a little skeptic about the current standing of the market. I’m looking for a long term, high-risk but high yield investment. I need to put my money to work soon!! (This is one of my main short term goals)
* Planning on maxing out $5,500 for 2014 Roth IRA ASAP (after my first couple paychecks), as well as utilizing my employer match of 2% in or company’s 401(k), which will be ~$1,000 free money for the year.
* Also planning on putting a decent chunk of my income into the 401(k) up to $17,500. I talk to my parents’ financial advisor about the different funds I am offered and how to distribute the contributions.
* Company pays for my cellphone and majority of health/dental/life/disability insurance (May be 100-150/month, have not yet enrolled in the plans)
So after some basic math assuming I make $55,000 and contribute the maximum $17,500 to my 401(k) before taxes….after 25% tax is taken out and after contributing the max $5,500 to the Roth IRA, I will have $22,600 per year.
After the $300 (rent and car insurance) per month to the parents and the company health insurance, that is about $1,500 cash per month. In my current situation, I do not see myself spending more than $500 per month (gas, entertainment, clothes, etc.)


**Major financial events in the near future:**

* I plan on moving out into my own apartment within the next year. It is really nice saving that extra $800-1,000 each month on rent, but I don’t want to live at home forever. I have a few friends nearby that already rent their own places and would want to split a 2-4 person apartment or rental house.
* New car. I am assuming I will buy/lease a new car within the next 5 years, not depending on how long my current one will last. I could always sell it for $3,000-5,000 a couple years down the road when I buy a new one.
* There’s not enough time in life to only have one income, therefore I am definitely planning on using my money to make more money, whether its rental properties or investing in a short-term (non-retirement) basis. I really like the idea of having a secondary and eventually tertiary passive income that isn’t held up in retirement accounts, and that’s what I will be working towards a couple years from now when I have a decent amount saved up.

Please critique and give me suggestions on my current financial standing. I’m happy to give any additional information if asked, but I feel like this is a pretty good overview for starters. Thanks!!!

**EDIT:** Wow guys, thanks for all the great suggestions! I've read through pretty much every comment, lots of helpful information below for not just me, but for anyone else in a similar situation. I'm going to bed now but I plan on summarizing all of the ideas into one solid financial plan.",finance,1389567284
Bitcoin,"In response to ""7 things bitcoin can't do""","""Though Bitcoin payments are fast, they are not instantaneous. It typically takes over 10 minutes to clear a transaction, which must be recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain""

Bitcoin is a protocol for money... it's a platform meant to be built on top of. That means in the future you will see things being built on top of it that will take transactions off the blockchain. For instance an exchange does this. When you buy dollars on mt gox you don't have to wait 10 minutes. The transaction is off the blockchain... it's instant. Additionally transactions can happen near instantly it just depends on the risk you are willing to take. A transaction will propagate across the network faster than 8 minutes but it won't be included in a block yet. If you are a company like newegg you can accept the transaction instantly because you aren't shipping the item immediately anyway . So many transactions could be done fast even without a layer on top of the protocol. One last thing....... when you buy with a credit card even though the transaction seems instantaneous the funds don't actually arrive to the merchant for a week or more later. When a bitcoin transaction is included in the block chain the funds have arrived. For merchants that is a clear win.

""Consumers can't unilaterally undo a Bitcoin transaction like they can a credit card payment. However, the Bitcoin protocol is being updated to better facilitate refunds initiated by the merchant.""

The answer to this is related to my previous answer. A transaction is irreversible but that doesn't mean something can't be built on top. For instance if ebay wanted to accept bitcoins they could have users upload bitcoin funds and do transfers internally off the block chain. In this way they could control and reverse transactions. And as a side note.... it is in a merchants best interest to act in an honest manner. It is in a consumers best interest to act in a malicious manner. It makes more sense to have the burden of trust placed on customers rather than merchants because of these natural signals. A merchant has reviews. They need to keep a positive image to retain customers. Customers don't have reviews. It is in their best interest to defraud merchants. Why do people think that is okay?  Also irreversible transactions allows for new business models that really couldn't be viable before. For instance the sale of virtual goods. If you tried to sell something like WoW gold on ebay the merchant easily gets scammed so it is not a viable business model. With bitcoin... transactions are irreversible and you can build things on top of the blockchain that can do reversals so it is the best of both worlds.

""
Governments typically do not accept taxes in anything other than the official currency, but there are efforts to introduce bitcoin into the mix. E-Gov Link, for example, accepts bitcoins for parking tickets and other fees.""

Well I don't see this one changing any time soon unfortunately. In a truly free market currencies would be allowed to compete with each other and a government should simply accept currencies at their current exchange rate and not give special privileges (the dollar is created by the Fed who are private).


""Though there are concerns about criminals using bitcoins to launder funds, the digital currency is a bad way to cover one's tracks. Since each transaction is recorded publicly, Bitcoin users are establishing a trail that anyone can follow""

For the average user this is probably true. However things are in the works like darkwallet... zerocoin. If bitcoin is allowed it essentially allows all alt coins so if there is an alt coin that is completely anonymous you would be able to buy it easily with bitcoin. Also there are ""mixing"" services where you can try to launder your coins but it is still somewhat traceable. The only way to move significant amounts of money into or out of bitcoin is through exchanges so if those are regulated then money laundering isn't exactly easy (I think that is a good thing right?) .

"" Mortgages

A few homes have been listed for sale in bitcoins, but buyers must have the funds on hand. Regulatory issues and the volatility of Bitcoin's value preclude mortgages priced in the virtual currency""

Notice the keyword here ""priced in the virtual currency"" . You can simply not price it in the virtual currency but pay with it. Also to be technical bitcoin is considered a ""digital currency"" not a virtual one. I have also read real estate offers where bitcoin could be used as partial payment which means you don't need to have the entire funds.

""Lend Money into Existence
 
Because there is a fixed supply of bitcoins, it's impossible to simultaneously store a bitcoin in a blockchain address and lend it out, as banks do with deposits. However, firms could issue IOUs for bitcoins, which could then be used as a method of payment.""

Is Creating money from nothing and lending it out at interest something we want? A better criticism would have been ""you can't make loans in bitcoin because it is a deflationary currency and the borrower may inevitably default on their loan"" . 

Anyways to answer this question... you could create money with bitcoin. You can color a coin. You could take a single satoshi and color it and call it new money that is worth some large amount, then lend it. So the question is not if you can loan money into existence..... the question is actually why would the market accept that money?

""Avoid Infringement Claims
 
Many digital currencies have been built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, including the infamous Kanye West-themed Coinye. West sent a cease-and-desist letter to Coinye's developers, prompting Coinye to change its mascot to a ""half-man-half-fish hybrid"" that still bears a passing resemblance to the celebrity who inspired it. (Image: Bloomberg News)""

Patent troll companies are really the scum of the earth. Who knows what they will try to come up with in relation to bitcoin. On the plus side.... the bitcoin ecosystem is full of intelligent people who will ardently defend it. Also decentralization helps.",cryptocurrency,1389567780
personalfinance,High yield savings vs CDs interest rate question [US],"I wanted to do something with an emergency fund of 20k other than sitting in a generic savings account slowly wasting away.

personalfinance,I'm almost there! Finish off student loans or defer to support other goals?,"First, my thanks! I posted here around this time last year to figure out how to tackle my loans and got some great advice. 

My current student loan balance (total ~$36,000) looks like:

| Amount  | Rate |
|:----------|:-------------|     
|$8,500|2.8%|
|$9,300|2.75%|
|$18,000|2.6%|

**Income**

I am going to take home roughly $50,000 after tax this year (in total). 

**Spending**
 
My total outlays are fairly low at their minimum ($800/month = $9,600/year). 

This leaves me with about 50,000 - 36,000 - 9,600 = $4,400 of disposable income for the year if I put all of my money towards the loans. 

**Investing**

I have $5,000 in an emergency fund. My Roth IRA is maxed out for 2014.

My company does not match 401k contributions, so I haven't been making any. Considering the interest rates on my loans are fairly low (although they are variable), I'm thinking it may be wise to max out the 401k as well. However, that means prolonging this lingering debt (despite the likely profits I would make for my retirement given the market as of late). 

**Life**

I live in an area with a high cost of living and I've been taking advantage of home life, but I'm starting to overextend my stay and need to think about my future as an independent as well.

I really want to get rid of the debt for good, but I also want to boost my retirement, and I also want to set myself up for when I move out. These goals seem conflicting in the sense that I can't complete all three at once.

gaming,"generational terms in reference to consoles, IMO, should be changed","I am of the opinion that we (as non marketing people) should altogether drop the next gen/this gen/current gen terminology due to the fact that it's just marketing talk. It's the crap that marketers and advertisers attempt to feed us in the hopes that it will fuel our consumerism. I think we should refer to the console generations by their numerical value. So instead of saying something like ""Oh man, that game will look great on next-gen hardware!"", we should replace it with ""Oh man! That game will look great on eighth-gen hardware!"" Admittedly it doesn't sound as snappy as the term ""next gen"" but then again, i'm not a marketer, as I said earlier. 

Also I am hearing too many people still referring to PS4/XBO/WiiU as next-gen consoles. That bugs me. We are **IN** the ""next gen"" that people are mostly referring to right now. We are likely SEVERAL years from the true ""next gen"" so when people say ""next gen"" now they could be causing confusion to those that might not be up on their terminology as some us might be. If you say something like ""That game looked good on 7th gen, but the sequel is going to look AWESOME on 8th gen!"" there is no mistaking what anyone is talking about. 7th gen refers to Wii/PS3/Xbox360 and 8th gen refers to WiiU/PS4/XBO. There is no confusion and people can't be fed any crap by marketers that way either. Well, I guess it lessens the crap they try to feed us anyway.

I'm moving into a new place with my partner and my half of the rent shouldn't be more than $750. I'm not much into eating at restaurants and I don't spend too much at bars, so my total expenses can probably be rounded to $1000/month. I'm sure I could find a nice 100K job when I graduate in 4 years, but I'm hoping to find a startup idea I really believe in to invest some money in it (once I graduate around 2018).

Right now I'm looking to just safely invest my money to grow with inflation. I have no illusions about being able to beat the stock market and just want a low risk, diversified portfolio. Does anyone have advice on how to go about this for someone with my finances?

One more thing: my partner made some credit card-based mistakes in the past and now has ~$3,000 in debt. Now he's slowly but steadily paying it off and is always great with paying his fair share of things. If we're still together after a while, I wouldn't mind paying off his debt. I'm sure he's paying horrible interest rates and hurting his credit score. Does anyone have experience with situations like this? it seems silly for him to struggle while I have money sitting around if we'll eventually be entangling finances anyway.

investing,Requested thoughts on a goal I have.,"Hello all,

I live in New Zealand which is a different financial landscape from a lot of countries, especially America, but am still keen to get some advice from any and all.

I am currently in a decent job that pays $100,000NZD, about $83,000 USD a year before tax. I am 25 years old with no debt and about $100k of mixed savings, mostly shares. I am single.

My job is very secure and I don't have a lot of desire for travel as I do that with my job, thus I have a lot of disposable income/savings potential.

My goal is to have $2mil USD in cash/assest by the time I am 55 (30 years).

I have looking at a few calculators, based on inflation of ~3% (big assumption I know) I could get there by averaging 7% in funds and putting away $2000 a month or so.

This seems like a solid option, obviously love, kids etc may change my ability to do so.

Another option is real estate. The market in New Zealand is very different I think from America. The cost of building a new house is around $260,000 USD for just the basic house, and land obviously ranges from nothing in a small rural area to mega dollars in a city.

I currently live in Auckland, the biggest city, and it has what a lot of people say is a bubble, while others say the new norm with so much immigration and expats coming home now that our economy is set to have a booster year.

The average house price is 7x the average income or more in some areas. You are paying $500k Min for a very average house in a bad area or a very small townhouse in a semi decent area. This is about %15 growth a year over the last couple years.

The reason I bring this up is my other thought of buying 4-5 properties over the next 10 years and having the rent pay for the houses. I know this comes with other catches and effort. The rents here are not rising anywhere near the house prices, which leads me to believe its mostly investors. Interest rates are set to rise 1-3% over the next few years.

My questions are:

What is the best way to achieve my goal, anything to add to the above points?

Is there something I am missing or other options?

Does anyone know anything about the Auckland, NZ property market, and their thoughts on a bubble?

Bitcoin,A native Chinese' interpretation of latest TV program from China,"http://v.baidu.com/kan/tvshow/?id=1650&amp;site=&amp;n=20140111&amp;url=http://tv.cntv.cn/video/C10329/61f395422e384964b13e7d3140930cbb#frp=v.baidu.com/v

My interpretation of how Bitcoin was portrayed in the program coming from a native Chinese speaker:

Bitcoin is a high stakes game. That's all it is. They highighted a few individuals. One was someone who bought at the top with all his savings and capitulated and sold at the bottom - citing many others who did the same. Wretched impact on these families. A businessman got into selling Bitcoin mining machines and after the price collapse, many customers returned or cancelled their orders forcing this businessman to lose his entire year of profits that he had made on Taobao from his main cosmetics business. OKCoin saw their customer base double from 60,000 to 120,000 during the boom and then saw volumn collapse after the government laid out their measures. Lastly they cited how many students and young people lacking in life experiences and trading experiences had borrowed money from their friends and put it in Bitcoin, and now cannot get the money out from the exchanges to return to the other students. This supposedly led to life threats and violence. This is especially bad, as we are approaching Chinese New Years and so many people have suffered from this wild game.

Almost no mention during this video about anything to do with the lower transaction fees and how it can help merchants save. They also did not mention the technological innovation that is the blockchain. Of course, the program did not mention the ability to send money privately to anyone and anywhere in the world.
As for the government's own measures taken, they tried to play it off as the government doing it's job to protect its people's interests. To support their position, the program cited that Thailand had banned it, South Korea heavily warned against it, and India had taken measures against it.
A fascinating can't keep your eyes off of it game they called Bitcoin and it was the mania of 2013 because of its extreme volatility and tempting price action. We should feel sorry for the people's losses and the state is doing the right thing to prevent such tragedies in the future. No mention of anything other than this is one big game. Bitcoin buyers were described as 'players' of this addictive game but that the real consequences were tragic. 

TL;DR: In the states at least the media joke about whether it can replace the USD or make the Fed nervous. In China, the preferred strategy seems to be to make it seem like a virtual game.",cryptocurrency,1389597771

personalfinance,Clearing up a couple tax misconceptions,"Hey all, I'm sure most of you know this already and this may have been posted here before, but a few of my coworkers and friends have been complaining about taxes when they don't actually know how it works, so I'd like to explain a couple things. (The bolded statements are the truth).

1. **Bonuses are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.**

 It is hard to convince people that this is true, because they just take out their paystub and go ""See!? You're wrong."" However, the fact is, while your bonus check probably gets *withheld* at a higher rate, that check won't be taxed differently than your other checks. **There is no difference in taxes paid between someone who makes $150k/year and someone who makes $50k/year with a $100k bonus.** The reason your check is withheld differently is because of the way your employer calculated how much to withhold. There are 2 ways to withhold, both of which are explained [here](http://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/2011/12/09/bonus-time-how-bonuses-are-taxed-and-treated-by-the-irs/). TLDR: Your bonus is either withheld at a flat 25% or is withheld from the table using an income of your normal monthly pay plus your bonus. The short thing to understand is, withholding will probably more than you're used to, but any overpayment will be refunded at return time.
 
 For example, a lot of people say that bonuses are taxed at 40% instead of their normal 20-30%. So here's a quick calculation using the 25% method. You're going to have 25% withhold just for federal taxes. Then add 6.2% for Social Security (for income under,$117k), 1.45% for Medicare, and 5.75% for Virginia State Income Tax (I'm in VA). After all of these, you have seemingly paid 38.4% on your taxes! This is the number people like to use when complaining about bonus tax, but federal income tax is only part of it. And, this tax number is the smaller of the two ways to calculate bonus check withholding. If your employer used the aggregate method, your withholding will most likely be even higher! However, if your effective tax rate is below 25% (or the federal tax bracket used with the aggregate method), then you will see some of this money back when you file your return.

2. **A bonus or raise to the next tax bracket *almost* never nets you less money.**

 This is a simple misunderstanding of how marginal tax brackets work. I always hear stories about getting bumped up to the next tax bracket being bad, and how they get less after tax money overall because they got bumped up a bracket. **The fact is, only the extra money that puts your over the bracket line will get taxed at the higher rate.**

 Say you are single and make $87,800. This puts you in the 25% tax bracket, and only $50 away from the next tax bracket. Then you get a bonus of $100. $50 of your bonus will get taxed at 25%, and $50 will be taxed at 28%. The rest of your $87,800 is still taxed the same way as it would have been had you not gotten your bonus. The only way declining the bonus would be beneficial is - oh wait there is no way.

**TLDR: Don't complain about getting more money!**

* $50K in checking account. No savings account (never made sense to me because of interest rates being so low). $30K is in my brokerage account in cash and with I'm guessing another $20K in securities.
* Never had a credit card (I actually applied two years ago to the bank where I had my checking account. They denied me, despite all the savings I had with them. Haven't reapplied since.)
* Basically no credit history at all.
* Cell plan is $50 / month prepaid plan with T-Mobile. Considering switching to Straight Talk.

personalfinance,Overwhelming student loans,"Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place for this but I have some questions regarding my student loans.

I just graduating from school with a degree in engineering and around ~85k in student debt. About half of my loans are federal loans and the other half are at varying interest rates with a private company. On top of that I have one loan with an absolute awful interest rate that is ~10k that I had to get one semester when I didn't have a cosigner. 

I just started working and will be making around ~65k plus performance based bonuses. I am currently living with a long term girlfriend that doesn't make nearly as much as I do but still will be pitching in with day to day costs. 

I am just overwhelmed with the magnitude of my loans and don't know where to start. Should I consolidate my private loans and leave my federal loans alone? Should I sit down with a professional to discuss my options? 

I really just want to get started and get these paid off before I retire :). I know I need to make some sacrifices and keep living like I am a poor college student but otherwise I am just lost. It is so hard to try and calculate things out with all my private loans at different amounts and interest rates. 

EDIT: Also should I prioritize putting some money into retirement/savings starting right away or should I focus on my loans?

EDIT2: It is probably important to mention that besides my loans the only other notable expenses I have are rent, utilities, groceries, and car insurance. I do have a few hundred dollars on my credit card but will be paying that off after my first paycheck. I am completely broke at the moment but my monthly expenses shouldn't exceed much more than ~$600-700 dollars (rough estimate, I am trying to actually budget things out so hopefully I will have a better idea soon). 

EDIT3: So after looking most of my federal loans are a fixed rate at 6.8% since I started school 5 years ago. It looks like since then new federal loans have dropped to three point something. Would it be possible to consolidate these at a lower rate? My private loans are at even worse rates but I don't know if there is anything I can do about that.",finance,1389633172

Bitcoin,Simply Bitcoin,"Ponzi scheme, tulip bubble, no government backing, no intrinsic value, deflationary, too complex, and only used to buy illegal drugs are just a few of the buzz words/phrases produced by the mainstream media in reference to Bitcoin. If what these news agencies say can be trusted, people’s first impression of Bitcoin should be skeptical. But if one turns off their TV and does their own research, what will be found is an internet community dedicated to supporting what they claim to be the most revolutionary invention of our lifetime. I have been following Bitcoin’s progress toward mass-adoption since March 2013 and what I have witnessed makes me comfortable to say that it could very well live up to these expectations. I believe Bitcoin has the potential to have as large of an impact on our way of life as the invention of the automobile and the internet. The automobile greatly freed the individual’s transfer of physical location, the internet freed the individual’s transfer of knowledge, and Bitcoin will free the individual’s transfer of wealth. This will be a global revolution, it will shake up a lot of industries, and it will not be welcomed warmly by the status quo.

So what is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a five year old currency whose fundamental characteristics make it very unique compared to any other currency that has ever existed. Bitcoin is the first successful implementation of a digital currency that has recently grabbed headlines as its exchange rate has exploded from $13 to over $1000 in 2013 alone. Bitcoin is best described as cash for the internet because it can be transferred like physical cash, directly from one person to another, in varying amounts. What makes Bitcoin different is it can be instantly sent anywhere the internet exists and each individual Bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal places. Anyone with a device connected to the internet can essentially become their own bank by simply downloading a program that acts as their digital wallet. Bitcoin’s next big difference is in its infrastructure and what makes it work. Bitcoin is said to be decentralized because its payment system and the issuance of the currency are not governed by any single entity. Instead, Bitcoin is managed by individuals who voluntarily use their computers to run the system as a network. This allows transactions with Bitcoin to occur without the need of a trusted third party, e.g. VISA. The final characteristic of Bitcoin is its limited supply. The rate at which new Bitcoins are created is set in digital stone meaning it can not be counterfeited and there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins total. In order to fully understand why Bitcoin’s properties give it such potential, it is important to understand the properties of traditional payment systems.

The US Dollar, Euro, and Yen are the three most popular currencies in the world and are what I refer to as traditional payment systems. These currencies are also known as fiat currencies. Fiat means the currency is issued by an authoritative figure who declares it as a legal medium of exchange. In the case of the US Dollar, this authoritative figure is the US government and its central bank, the Federal Reserve. Fiat currencies have no intrinsic value but instead derive their value from the authoritative figure combined with the basic market forces of supply and demand. The central bank has the ability to adjust the supply of fiat currencies and demand is produced by everyone who uses the currency to value things. When supply of a fiat currency increases faster than demand, the currency experiences inflation which causes it to lose value and purchasing power. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, the US Dollar has lost ~97% of its value due to inflation. Many economists view Inflation as a feature of fiat currencies that encourages people to spend their money, rather than save. Because of this, people tend to save their money in things that are protected from inflation. One of these things that acts as a true store of value, free of supply manipulation, is gold. People have used gold for thousands of years and give it value because its supply is limited, it can be stored without a trusted third party, it’s transportable, and it can be divided into almost any amount. Sound familiar? How valuable as a medium of exchange would gold be if it could be instantly transported across the planet?

This is where Bitcoin comes in. With its gold and cash like properties, I believe Bitcoin has the potential to greatly disrupt the status quo of how value is exchanged and stored in our society. The speed at which transactions occur over any distance and the fact that anyone can use Bitcoin means people can do international sales without having to deal with multitudes of different currencies. Being divisible up to eight decimal places allows Bitcoin to be used for transactions of any size. Being decentralized gives Bitcoin several advantages over traditional payment systems, both economically and politically. The fee for all Bitcoin transactions is a fixed amount and it is orders of magnitude less than traditional fees that usually charge a percentage. Having low fees incentivizes people to use Bitcoin since the money that would be used to pay the higher fees instead gets directly translated into either more profit for the seller or a cheaper price for the buyer. Being decentralized also means Bitcoin will never “go down” since there is no one central point of failure. The political bonus of this is that a government would not be able shut it down, even if they wanted to. Bitcoin’s predetermined and limited supply means it can not be counterfeited by criminals and it allows Bitcoin to act as a store of value like gold. These are the advantages that Bitcoin has over traditional payment systems.

Without even diving too far down the political rabbit hole, it is clear to see why I think Bitcoin will continue to grow into a mainstream currency and change our way of life. Bitcoin is a currency that shines light on the fundamental characteristics of our fiat currencies and it will usher in a new age of value transfer. An age where people will be free from the archaic financial institutions that are too big to fail and too big to jail. An age where families can save their money without worrying about a rogue central bank silently destroying its value. An age where anyone in the world can go online and have immediate access to an entire global economy. An age of financial freedom. As the famous futurist Buckminster Fuller once said: “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”",cryptocurrency,1389638246

personalfinance,25 with a nice income. Need some advice on allocation,"Hey everyone, I am a long time reader of PF but I really wanted some opinions on my current allocation of income. My wife and I are 25 years old, with income levels of 30k and 100k, respectively. Right now, we have no credit card debt, about 10k in savings, 10k in my 401k. I am contributing the federal maximum to my 401k, along with an employer contribution for up to 5k for a total annual 401k contribution of 22,500. 

We have a few debts that I would like to eliminate, 31k of student loan with interest rates between 6-6.8% and our vehicles, which are 25k at an interest rate of 2.25%. 

With some smart budgeting, my wife and I are confident we can pay off the student loans in 2014. My biggest concern is that we also would like to purchase a house in the next year or two, and are a bit concerned we are putting all our money into long term saving and not doing enough to prepare ourselves for a down payment. Does anyone have any advice on diversifying our savings into something a bit more liquid?

personalfinance,Could you all check my budget and give any other starting advice?,"First off, thanks for helping me out with this.  I've been reading r/PF quite a bit for the past six months and I've learned a lot.  I've always been a naturally frugal person (thanks to my Mom), but I've never really taken charge of my finances.  I've had a job of some sort since I was 14 or 15 and I've always had enough money for what I wanted to do, but I never thought ahead.  Last Christmas, someone got me ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" and it opened my eyes to the fact that I needed to take a more active role in my finances.  

I'm a 23 year old grad student graduating with a STEM Master's in May.  I'll be getting married and moving to the DC metro area.  I'll be starting a job making $70k a year with the potential for a yearly bonus of 10% of my salary.  From talking to the other people there (I worked there this past summer), almost everyone gets 90% or greater of that bonus.  However, I'm not factoring that into my budget since it's not guaranteed.  Also, since I'll only be working for half of the year my first year, I'll only be eligible for half of the bonus (it's 5% twice a year).  My fiance will be doing a required internship for her profession (kind of like clinicals for nurses), so she won't be making any money the first year.  However, once she does the internship and gets her certification, she will probably make anywhere from $45k to $70k, depending on what job she takes.  Neither of us have any undergraduate loans (thanks to scholarships and in state schools!), but i will have ~$60k in federal grad school loans at around 6.5% interest.  They will be in deferment until November, but we're going to start contributing right away.

I've come up with the proposed budget below, but I'm open to any suggestions!  I tried to overestimate a little.

    	                            Monthly   	Yearly
    Rent	                        $1,500.00	$18,000.00
    Electricity/Water	            $200.00	    $2,400.00
    Internet	                    $70.00	    $840.00
    Cell Phone	                    $80.00	    $960.00
    Renter's Insurance	            $15.00	    $400.00
    Car Insurance	                $75.00	    $900.00
    Health Insurance	            $0.00	    $0.00
    Food	                        $600.00	    $7,200.00
    Transportation	                $500.00	    $6,000.00
    Entertainment	                $150.00	    $1,800.00
    Student Loan Payments	        $800.00	    $9,600.00
    Safety Net	                    $250.00	    $3,000.00
    Before Tax Expenses	            $4,240.00	$50,880.00
    Taxes	                        $1,060.00	$12,720.00
    Traditional 401k Contributions	$350.00	    $4,200.00
    Total Expenses	                $5,650.00	$67,800.00

I'm figuring a tax rate of 25% (that includes Social Security, state witholdings, and all of that; I got it from the ADP Payroll Calculator).  We'll both be staying on our parents' health insurances for now.  Since we both have siblings and their bills won't go down if they drop us, they both agreed we don't have to pay them anything.  We'll also both be staying on our parents' cell phone plans and paying them a negotiated amount.  As far as the transportation expense goes, I'll be taking public transportation and will most likely get rid of my car.  She has a paid off, 27ish mpg small car.  It should last for at least 3 to 5 more years with minimal repairs.  However, as part of internship, she'll be traveling different places every few weeks, so it's hard to rely completely on public transportation and to determine how much our transportation expense will be.

My company matches 25% of the first 6% you contribute, so I plan to contribute the 6% until I get my student loans paid off.  Then I'll start increasing it.  I think Fidelity manages our 401k.  I know to pick a target retirement fund with the lowest expense ratio.  Does anyone have any particular suggestions?  I seem to remember reading some negative comments about Fidelity on here.  Also, I'll be taking public transportation to work (DC metro) and I know there is some sort of commuter benefit program for public transportation mentioned in the company literature.  I'm not sure on the details yet, but it basically seemed like they take the money out of your check pretax.  Does anyone have any experience with that?

I'll also be getting ~$2500 (post tax) as a relocation bonus, plus another ~$3500 my parents had planned to give us as a wedding/starting our life present.  Some of that will go to help with moving costs, but we're hoping a large portion of that will start as our emergency fund.  I've left some wiggle room in the budget ($2200) in case I didn't account for something correctly.  If we really end up with any amount left over and with whatever bonus I get, we plan to contribute to our emergency fund (depending on where we're at) or make extra payments towards the student loans.  

Once my wife (I haven't referred to her as this yet!) gets a full time position, we plan to minimize lifestyle inflation and live the same way for a year or two so that we can pay off our student loans. From there, we'll probably start saving for our other goals.  Those include saving more for retirement (6% of my income isn't even close to as much as I want to save), travel, and maybe some fun items (new bike for her, kayaks, more backpacking equipment), etc.  We're not really in any hurry to own a house, especially in the expensive housing market of DC.  We also don't know that we'll be staying there long term, so we don't have much incentive to buy any time soon, even if we are in a better financial position to do so.

I think I've covered everything, but please point out anything that you see missing.  Am I forgetting anything?  Do any estimates seem unrealistic?  Is there anything I could do better?  Should I put my extra money towards my student loans (6% interest) instead of retirement?  Psychologically, I like knowing that my debt is paid off, so I'll most likely focus on that for now, but is there any reason it might be better to contribute extra towards retirement instead?

investing,Considering investing $100k with Edward Jones. Looking for your opinions.,"Considering investing $100k with a financial adviser at Edward Jones. The FA seems talented and we are similar in our outlook (typical since we're both in our very early 30s). I'd rather take a passive role and hoping for a low risk scenario. So he's suggesting a portfolio of Blackrock funds: High Yield Bond Fund / World Income Fund / Int'l Opportunities Fund / Equity Dividend Fund / Global Allocation Fund / Health Sciences Opportunities Fund / Multi-Asset Income Fund. Any red flags before I pull the trigger? 

Goals: Beat the laughable interest rate I'm currently earning from Bank of America. Passive with low risk tolerance. Fairly liquid (meaning I can pull out in 2-3 years without penalties should I choose to).

Edit 1: Quick update to thank you for your responses. I'm overwhelmed by both the turnout and quality of advice given here. I'm going to bed now but hope to have some coherent thoughts to respond with in the morning.

Edit 2: I will say this of the FA, he claims to be salaried (non-commission) and that EJ is paid 40% of the Blackrock funds' cost. Other than that there are no charges (unless I pull out within the first year). Anyways, at the end of the day he was saying I could expect around $1,200 in dividends per year as well as 6-8% fund growth per year (assuming a healthy market). I would be happy with that for a few years... That being said, I am looking into the Vanguard option now, as suggested by many. Thanks again for all the sage advice!",finance,1389643818

My paychecks will be in US dollars, deposited to my bank account here in the states. I'm thinking about getting a Chase Sapphire Preferred due to the fact that it has no forex charges on purchases overseas. I would use that for most of my purchases, as I think it would be my cheapest option. I'm very certain that many local establishments will be cash only, so I will need to pull out local currency on a regular basis. I won't be carrying a balance at any point, so don't worry about interest rates on purchases.

I will keep my current debit card at my credit union and use it 12 times per month, as that is required to earn interest on my checking account and have overseas ATM charges reimbursed. That card has only 1% forex charges on all overseas purchases and cash withdrawals. Because I will need to withdraw local currency on a regular basis, it is fairly important to keep the fee free withdrawals, and the interest I earn on my checking should cancel out the 1% forex fee on withdrawals and purchases.

Does this seem like a sound approach, and is the Chase card a solid bet for me in this case?

Got married, got divorced, went back to grad school, got a job that paid enough to start with (44,000).  It's a small, growing healthcare company with a good benefits package and my position has good potential to move up.

I'm not as well informed about personal finance as I thought I was, but I'm doing my best to learn and make lifestyle changes to better manage my finances.

Please critique my budget and provide suggestions.  I would really appreciate it.

Debts:

* Health care credit card - $1400, 0 APR if I pay it off before July, 25% if I don't pay it off first.  (Had this card for years and have never been hit with the accumulated finance charge.  Not worried, since I will pay it off with year-end bonus soon)
* 2 active credit cards - $11,000 between, 12.99-14.899%
* 3 closed credit cards in active debt management - $4400 left, 6.00-9.90%. (I save more in interest per month than their fees, and I have 3 years left on my contract.)
* Car loan- $6000, 2.9%
* Student loans - Undergrad, private, $20,000, 2.38-3.25%.  My parents said they'd pay for school, but I'd like to start paying for this once life gets more stable.
* Student loans - Grad, federal, on IBR, 75,000, 5.45-6.25%

Assets - 
Not much to speak of.  Roughly $1200 in emergency fund, $2500 in Vanguard Roth IRA.  Actively contributing to a Roth 401k, enough to get the company match (100% of first 5%), ~2200 in there now.

Budget -
Roughly $2000 in income monthly after taxes, 401k contributions, health insurance, emergency fund savings, and flex health savings account (which I need for reoccurring prescriptions)

* Rent - $165 (moving in with roommates next week)
* Utilities - $40
* Phone - $85 (Will be swapping to Ting when I get a little closer to my contract date)
* Car payment - 236.50
* Grad student loans - 350
* Credit cards - 524
* Car insurance - 65
* Pets - 90
* Gas - 75
* Food - 100
* Incidentals - 50

Roughly 1800

That gives me about $200 extra to put towards my debts.  Starting with the health care credit card first, then on down the line.  Once some of the revolving, unsecured debt is cleared up I'd like to take over the undergrad loans from my parents.  I know my situation is not awesome, and I worry about waiting until all of that is cleaned up to start putting *anything* in my Roth IRA.  

Most of all, I'd just like to be stable.  Suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks, PF.

personalfinance,Calling anyone with Direct Student Loan Consolidation/Pay as you Earn/Public Service Loan Forgiveness experience,"I have just graduated school and got a job at a non-profit institution. I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about paying off my student loans. I currently have around $63k in total loans. $3k is a Federal Perkins Loan and $7.5k is an unsubsidized stafford loan. The rest of my loans are direct (mix of sub/unsub).

My plan is to wrap up these loans into a direct consolidated loan, then use Pay as you Earn (PAYE) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). PAYE means I'll be paying the absolute minimum monthly payment possible, and I'll qualify for the entire loan to be forgiven after 10 years of employment at any public/non-profit institution under PSLF. As a result, I'd only make about $40k in student loan payments over 10 years, despite currently owing $63k. There are very few enticing jobs for me in the private sector, so I'm not worried about missing any PSLF-eligible payments.

I'd just like to know if this is doable or not, and if anyone else has done or thought about doing anything similar. Questions:

1. The PAYE states that only direct loans are eligible. Is a direct consolidation loan into which my Perkins and unsub Stafford loans been wrapped still eligible?

2. Since the PAYE payments will be very interest-heavy, I'm curious the interest still be written off for federal taxes.

3. Since the monthly payment will be exactly the same regardless of loan balance (10% of discretionary income), is there any point to paying more than the minimum or paying interest during my deferment period? 

PS. I do qualify for PAYE; first loan was in 2008 (phew)",finance,1389688768

personalfinance,How to fund your Roth IRA with your emergency fund,"ETA: Can't tell if people aren't reading this post, or aren't understanding it. I'd be interested to hear dissenting opinions.

tl;dr:

* You should only use your Roth as part of your emergency fund as an interim measure while you build up emergency funds in a regular savings account.
* Building up that regular emergency saving account should be a priority.
* As long as your Roth is considered part of your emergency fund it should not be exposed to market risk.
* Once you have a regular emergency fund you should then invest your Roth funds for retirement.

---

*This post is not necessarily to encourage funding Roths from emergency funds, but explaining the right way to do it if you want to.*


It often comes up in this sub people who are just starting out and need to build up an emergency fund but are thus short on cash to invest in a Roth IRA. Often these people are likely to have enough cash flow to be maxing their Roth IRA yearly in a couple years along with having a fully-funded emergency fund, but it takes some time to build up that foundation. Then the idea is circulated that they could fund their Roth IRA from their emergency fund to reserve the space. Some people react negatively to this, often (though I'm sure not always) because they think that putting money in a Roth IRA fundamentally requires assuming market risk or that someone might do this in lieu of creating a regular emergency fund. I just wrote this up as a comment, but figured at this time of year, with the 2013 IRA contribution deadline approaching, it was worthy of a top level post:

A Roth IRA is just a type of account that subjects to whatever is held in it to a certain tax treatment. The benefit of a Roth IRA is that the limited amount of money ($5500/year currently) that you put into it, and any investment gains that money creates, is not subject to taxes when you withdraw it during retirement (and other certain other circumstances). Usually you'd have to pay long-term capital gain tax on your earnings (though there is currently a 0% ltcg bracket for some people, but that's new). Along the way your investment would also probably pay out dividends, and those would be subject to tax every year, even if you reinvested them. Dividends paid out within a Roth account are not taxed.

So, you have this Roth IRA account. You then have to choose how you are investing the money you put into that account. A ""Roth IRA"" is not an investment in and of itself. Putting money into a Roth IRA does not inherently carry any risk. You can put your Roth IRA money in CDs (earning a fixed, low, but insured, interest rate) or hold it as cash in a money market. Or you can invest it in a blend of stock and bonds. I generally suggest starting with a Target Retirement Fund like https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0699&amp;FundIntExt=INT. If you go to the ""portfolio"" tab for that you'll see it's made up of a set of stock/bond index funds. Once you have enough to meet the minimum investment (generally $3k) for multiple funds you can start investing in those component index funds yourself (www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). The Target Date fund costs a little more, but it does the rebalancing and changing risk to match your age for you.

But once you've invested the money help in your Roth IRA in stocks and bonds, you start to risk losing money. Your emergency fund needs to be 1) accessible and 2) not subject to market risk. Given you can withdraw your Roth principal, putting your emergency fund in a Roth it is still accessible. Then by keeping that money in a money market you are not subjecting it to market risk, but you are taking advantage of that $5500 worth of ""space"" in your Roth and ""reserving"" it for later.

Thus if you wanted to use money from your emergency fund to fund your Roth IRA you could do that and put it in a money market, so it'll still be there in an emergency. Then build your emergency fund back up outside your Roth IRA, and once the money in your Roth is no longer budgeted as part of your emergency fund, invest it in a Target Date fund (or other desired retirement allocation).

finance,An American Tourist in Mexico....,"An American tourist was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The tourist complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

The Mexican replied, ""Only a little while.""

The tourist then asked, ""Why didn't you stay out longer and catch more fish?""

The Mexican said, ""With this I have more than enough to support my family's needs."" 

The tourist then asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""

The Mexican fisherman said, ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life.""

The tourist scoffed, "" I can help you. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you could run your ever-expanding enterprise.""

The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But, how long will this all take?""

The tourist replied, ""15 to 20 years.""

""But what then?"" asked the Mexican.

The tourist laughed and said, ""That's the best part. When the time is right you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.""

""Millions?...Then what?""

The American said, ""Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.""

personalfinance,Initial plan failed.,"So, Chase opened up a credit card for me with a $900 credit limit. My plan was to have it increased and transfer my outstanding credit card debt (or some of it), snowball method them down and be debt free. However, Chase declines the credit limit due to how high my credit limit is on my other card and also probably due to how much debt it has. 

That card has ~$16,000 of debt at 29.95% interest.

I have not used my cards in a while and really plan on tackling these, but with this interest rate, it would take a long time for me to get this down.

personalfinance,Took out a car loan 3 months ago. Now I want to pay it off. Will this hurt credit score?,"I took out a 36 month car loan about 3 months ago and I could pay it all off right now if I wanted to.  One of the reasons I took the loan out was to build my credit history because my history was limited.  I made a down payment of ~$15,000 on the car.  The loan has a balance of $5,000 with a 2.5% interest rate (no prepayment penalty).

Now that I have had the car loan for a few months, I am now realizing that I miss the feeling of being debt-free.  I am willing to keep the loan open for a while longer (8-12 months) and pay the interest if in the end it will greatly improve my credit score or would hurt my credit score by paying it off this early.  

I am wondering if I screwed myself by now wanting to pay off the loan when I purposely took out the loan to improve my credit score?  If I pay it off, how will this affect my credit score and history?  Will it help my score/history at all for having a closed installment loan on my history (even if it was open for only 3-6 months)? - or would it hurt it?  Would it be beneficial to have the loan open for at least a specific amount of time (I have heard at least 6 months)?

personalfinance,On the verge of losing my job... checked my savings account... Thanks PF!!,"Wall of text inboud!: I am a contractor/consultant.  This is my first time being in this type of role.  Previously, I've been a full time employee without clients and contracts to worry about.  Some BS legal crap went down and my company got rolled of the contract (we are sub-contractors) and I was giving 1 month to find another contract within the company.  I freaked out for the first few days and got really depressed.  I contacted my talent advisor and started working with her to find a new role. Well, it has been 14 days and nothing...

My wife and I have been preparing for the worst - unemployment.  She does not make enough to keep us afloat for even a week.  I have child support and rent payments that I need to make.  Her income can pay the bills, but she has a lot of student loan payments and a car payment to make.

Through being a lurker here at PF, we picked up a lot of good tips and methods to manage our money.  We live a pretty frugal lifestyle because of PF.  

She handles the accounts and bills for us and I honestly have not looked at our savings account in about a year - shame on me.  

We sat down last week and made several changes to our spending and our debts to manage our money if the worst came.  We looked at our credit card bills and were delighted to see that they was very little on the 3 we have together.  Total was slightly more than the minimum payments!  And we did put quite a bit on them during the end of November and for the holidays.  We had been making double payments on her student and car loans for a while so we knew we could pay the minimums to save money in the short term.  Finally, the dreaded ""what do we have in savings?"" 

Much to my delight and relief, we have 4 months of savings to cover rent, child support and basic bills.  If we stick to our plan of optimizing our spending this month, we can stretch another month.  

The job market here is good, so I am not too worried about finding another job.  I just cannot take a large pay cut, but if that is all I can do, then we'll deal with it.  

For me, the stress of potentially being unemployed and *thinking* I have little savings was so bad that I felt like I was going to have panic attacks.  When I have time with son (7 YO) on the weekends and parts of the week, I have to put on the smile that nothing is wrong and everything is okay.  

If you are reading this please take the time to search throughout PF for any topic on savings and debt management.  We did and it helped keep our sanity for the worst scenarios.  

Here are some of the things we changed and implemented because of PF:

-  BUDGET, BUDGET, BUDGET!!!  Track all your expenses for the last 6 months or more.  Use Mint.com or other similar services to **assist** (not a full proof method).  Find where your deficiencies are and fix them.

-  CREDIT CARDS!!  We try to use our rewards cards when we can and when we know it aligns with our budget.  Groceries, gas, Amazon, etc.  We use the points to either pay on our cards or redeem them for gift cards.  We keep ZERO balances on them whenever possible (pretty much 100% of the time).  We did have one card that my wife had before we met that had $10k on it with a 26% interest rate.  We paid that one off very quickly after budgeting and paying it down to $0 within 14 months.

- BILLS!!  We also put our static bills (amount never/hardly changes - Internet, cellphone, etc) on our rewards cards as well.  We know the amount every month and we would normally pay it out of our checking account, but 1% on points adds up after a year and averaging $400~$500/month in bills alone.  If I could pay my rent on it, I would!  Secondly, we setup automatic payments through our bank and budget out those amounts every month. Never a missed bill.  

-  MISC EXPENSES!!  Shit happens and when it does, its good to be prepared financially.  Medical bills are a thing in my family and for the most part, they are predicable so we do HSA, but somethings it goes over and we can handle it.  Entertainment and ""nice-to-haves"" are budgeted, but we try hard not to use it.  What we don't, we move to savings at the end of the month.

-  SAVINGS!!  We use Mint to track most of our spending, but we do the nitty gritty with a spreadsheet.  Part of it involves contributing a percentage of our leftover income to the account.  Any extra we find, gets skimmed off there.

- RETIREMENT!!  I failed in this department for YEARS.  I sacrificed a lot of retirement being a single dad for many years.  I needed all the money I could get to survive.  I am 32 and have a GRAND TOTAL of $4000 in a Roth IRA and several thousand in my 401k w/ max contributions and company matching.  The plan is to get our savings up for 6 months of survival and then both of us putting in the maximum amount we can every year.",finance,1389734012

I'm 25 years old. I graduated in 2010 and did a term of service for AmeriCorps before joining the workforce. I had no financial assistance whatsoever during my time in college so I paid for it all on my own. I used a credit card to cover books and worked as an RA to cover housing and food. The first thing I did when I graduated and started making money was pay off the credit card because it had the highest interest rate. My loans were in forbearance during that time, and I'm now in a position where I've been paying them down (started at $30K).

Unfortunately, I live in one of the most expensive places in the country (AmeriCorps brought me here) and the cost of living is quite high, even in bad areas. My current living situation is as cheap as they come out here (so cheap, in fact, that my bike got stolen from our storage locker and my shared apartment has been broken into once already). So, unfortunately, as you look at my budget, please know that I can't move to a cheaper place, at least not any time soon. My job is also incredibly location specific in nature and isn't really transferable to other parts of the country. But almost anything else is on the table.

Here's my budget:

* Rent: $575.00
* Food &amp; Dining: $170.00 - Groceries $135, eating out/bars $35
* Bills &amp; Utilities: $65.00
* Shopping / entertainment: $60.00 (clothes, music gear, video games, etc.)
* Health &amp; Fitness: $45.00 (discount gym membership + monthly prescription
* Gas/Car: $40.00 (varies because I usually ride my bike to work; luckily, stepdad pays for car insurance)
* Gifts &amp; Donations: $30.00
* Student Loans: $415.00

Total expenses: $1400

Student Loan Debt: -$24,475 at 6.5% interest (recent grad)

Savings: $300

I was making around $1400 a month when I made this budget. My income just went up to $2,100 a month after taxes. I have no credit card debt (thank goodness). Where should that extra $700 a month go? Into student loans? Savings? Split between the two?

personalfinance,Set me straight on withholdings please...,"I'm relocating to a new area for a new job in June, and I'm trying to budget. Put plainly, I'll be working in MO, and living in KS (Kansas City shenanigans). This is a sanity check post.

I am making 60k, paid biweekly. Employer matches 50% up to 6.5% of salary for 401(k). Since I start halfway into the year (June 30th), I need to double my pay period contribution in order to get the maximum employer match for this year: 

.065 * 60k / 26 * 2 = $300 must be contributed per pay period.

60k / 26 = 2307, so before any taxes happen, I'm starting at approximately a $2000 paycheck, right? Now for the goofiness.

[Here](http://dor.mo.gov/pdf/biweekly.pdf) is the 2014 MO income tax witholding table.

If I am reading it correctly, MO is skimming (2000 - 1900) * .06 + 80 = $86 per paycheck, yes? I have also read that MO has a flat 1% tax rate simply for working or living in the state. Does this mean I'm just starting at 1980 instead of 2000, and that they're really witholding roughly $85?

Similarly, [this](http://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/whtables2014.pdf) is what I found for those living in KS. 

It looks like they're going to withhold another $77 or $78, depending on how the 1% MO tax works, right?

I know that SS and Medicare total up to another 7.45%, which is $148. Using a quick-and-dirty online calculator, it looks like federal withholding will be around $315, does that seem right?

All in all, 1980 - 85 - 77 - 148 - 315 = $1355 per pay period. Does this seem correct? Is this accurate enough to try to budget with?

personalfinance,"For student loans, is it always better to pay off highest interest rate loans first?","I'm a little embarrassed this is throwing me for a loop because I pride myself on being good at math and problem solving, but here goes:

Let's say you have two loans at different interest rates. Anecdotal wisdom always says that you pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first. But what if you have a much higher principal amount on the lower-interest-rate loan so that the total interest accrued is higher? Shouldn't you be paying that down first?

For example:

Loan 1: $3,000 loan at 10% interest rate

Loan 2: $1,000 loan at 20% interest rate

Am I wrong to assume that, in a year loan 1 would accrue $300 in interest and loan 2 would accrue $200 in interest, so you should pay down loan 1 until the interest it generates is equal to the interest generated on loan 2? i.e. You should pay down loan 1 until the principal amount is at $2,000?

personalfinance,"Shifting personal funds into new accounts, and what is my outlook for buying a house?","So here is where I am at:

Enlisted in the Army when I was a college student. Ended up becoming an officer. No college debt, good first job as a young Lieutenant out of school.

Did two deployments to Afghanistan, amongst other deployments and stints in training. It was not fun. The only good thing was that it forced me to save money. A lot of money. Now I have a civilian job earning $85,000/yr before taxes, plus reserve pay = about 95k-100k a year before taxes. No kids, no spouse. I am 28 years old.

Long story short:
$83,000 in a Vanguard money market account (currently acting as rainy day fund, real overkill at the moment. This money needs a new home)
$42,000 in Morgan Stanley mutual funds (money needs a new home as well, Morgan Stanley is charging a lot for fees.)
$16,000 in a Roth IRA (I am maxing this out every day so long as I can afford to)
$11,000 in an Army investment account, that will end in about 60 days and the money will have to find a new home.
$11,500 in an E*TRADE account, because I am just messing around. After August 2014, I plan to find a new home for this money.
TOTAL: $163,000

Only debt I have is $30,000 left on my car (I kinda splurged on a 2014 Audi S4 when I got back from my second time in Afghanistan) interest rate is 1.74% so I am not in a hurry to pay it off.

Credit score is good. No other debts. I do not currently own a house or have a mortgage, I am thinking of buying one.
So here are plans:
Vanguard funds need to be moved into something different. Right now it is sorta in a holding pattern until I figure out what to do with it.
Morgan Stanley is charging me something like 2% fees, it has earned something like 7% in the last few years. I am likely going to move those finds into a no-load mutual fund account, probably with Vanguard.
Roth IRA is going to stay where it is. I have already maxed it out for 2014, I plan to continue to max it out as long as I can afford it.
The money in the Army investment account is a temporary thing that was only available for the time I was deployed overseas. That money is going to become liquid cash in the next 60 days, I need to find a new home. Likely going to be no-load funds with my Vanguard account.
Some of this, maybe 12-15k, will be staying in Vanguard moneymarket funds as my rainy day fund.
MY BIG QUESTION:

Bitcoin,Difficulties Spreading to Credit Unions Now...,"Recently I have made quite a profit in altcoin mining and traded to BTC and sent the funds to my fiance. We both have CoinBase accounts and I've done a good amount of business and my fiance a fair share of consistent buys each pay check. I've cashed out through their services with my CU and have had no issues. Because I didn't want to flag my account, as a preventative, I sent her the BTC and had her cash out for us. I simply wanted to get out less than $5,000 cash to purchase a vehicle to replace my old clunker that my fiance took over when her highly engineered German vehicle bit the dust. Her CU is not the same as mine, but I've read reports that others had not had issues, or so it seemed. We, more specifically me, was accused of trying to scam my fiance and they (the CU) was quite certain the deposit would bounce a few days after posting. I called them out on this BS as they claimed CoinBase was known for defrauding. I stood my ground and stated I have been doing frequent business with CoinBase as I not only invest, trade, but mine (and explained).  The CU spoke to me still as if my hard earned money was a result of a card scam I was pulling online on ""some unwitting, young female"" simply because of the inherit nature of the internet behind BitCoin (not like all other currencies aren't wired too). We explained that we live together and I demanded my money. The CU said it was their money and they ""might"" release it to me and that it is my fiance's money, not mine now. They say this as if I am defrauding her online and am trying to do a charge-back scam. They had nothing but legitimate proof of transactions but made up a story to support their ignorance. 

After being fed up with this treatment, my temper was released before I hung up, told the banker to to fuck himself. Some time passes and they ""determine"" they can release it in 10 days. ""Might"" release it my butt, I win.

I just walked out of the dealership and have a decent offer of $286/month (72mos) for a 2012 Ford Focus. I really like how this car drives and it is what I want, but I don't need a new car at this time. 

However, I would like to eventually trade in my Saturn, rather than running it to the ground. My current payment is $140/month with about $4800 left. 

I'm getting some advice that the trade-in value will go down after it surpasses the 100,000. This is coming from my brother and the dealership. Yes, I know the dealership probably wants me to ""buy now"", but I want to know if there is some truth in it. 

Also, I am about to enter my repayment period for my student loans and am applying for a lower payment plan, and do not know how much it will be (Currently, it states it will be $1022, but I do not make enough to support myself with that payment so I am applying for the federal payment plans...waiting to hear back because I have to wait until 60 days of my payment due date to apply...).

dogecoin,A poem for my fellow doges - The History behind Dogecoins,"My fellow shibes,

Let me tell you...

The story about

How Dogecoin grew.



It was started one day,

As an old rusty penny.

Nobody knew,

Well only a few.





Not many knew about the Shibe crew.

But people knew about the doge, and this meme.

And a few talented gents decided to build a cryptocurrency.

There was now the small Dogecoin team.




And one day, people discovered this ""dogecoin"",

And saw the adorable face of the doge.

""Hey, would you mind if I would join?""

The future of the coin was still foggy.




Alas, another day, a tip bot was made.

At the time, the dogecoin was a bit lonely.

The tip bot became the shibe's aide.

People were tipped, and more people now knew.




""Wow, very wow,"" /u/ ummjackson said.

The community was growing, more people were knowing!

The currency slowly grew, and out shadowed a few,

Like the Fedoracoin which became practically dead.




Soon there were thousands of shibes.

Very popular, the coin became.

The creators surprised at the support,

And Doge became a household name.




But there still is plenty of room to grow,

For we still need to get to the moon.

So let us hope for the growth of our Doge,

And for a intelligent interested tycoon.",cryptocurrency,1389764863
personalfinance,Advice Needed - Student Loans,"Long story short, my parents are in a bit of a bind being now 50 with nearly no retirement, and they need me to start taking out loans for school.

I'm a second semester sophomore now, so five semesters left (damn the 120 credit requirement straight to hell) at a total of $12,212.00 per semester. I get $2,000 per year from the Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan with another $3,500 from the Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan, half of each per semester brings my per-semester total to $9,490. (The school financial aid payment site says $1,732 from the subsidized Stafford and $990 from the unsubsidized loan last semester, not really sure what happens to the $56 a year I'm apparently missing from that. Maybe processing fees or something.)

I want to rid them of the financial burden my education is placing them under, so I'm looking at taking out the full amount for my education for the remaining time I have in school. Discover just approved me for a loan for this semester's total cost, at a fixed interest rate of 10.49%, and I have yet to take the offer.

Feel free to check this, but it looks like after 2.5 years of $9,490 being added biannually at 10.49%, followed by a 4 year period of graduate school (I'm on track for a Ph.D program) with no addition to the principal (woohoo grants), I should be sitting at around $120K in outstanding debt.

Given that I'm hoping to move into quant finance shortly after grad school, is it reasonable to take out these loans or should I be looking elsewhere?",finance,1389765602

I know live in a nice 80k EUR worth apartment for 300 EUR rent monthly. 

So here it goes. The 20 k interest I would have to return to the bank means 20.000/300 = 66 months of rent ≈ 6 years. Living in a rented place I have no concerns of roof leaking, piping... care free.

Bitcoin,I think my dad just single-handedly destroyed Bitcoin because I had no answer for his question.,"So I was explaining to my dad the entire concept of Bitcoin and he seemed skeptic and was giving me the ""Wow, still have a lot to learn"" look and told me the following almost verbatim:

""Okay. Lets say this fantasy plays out. Bitcoin continues to grow, more people begin to obtain it. More of it is mined. So, lets say the rate of growth of adoption is exponential as you expect it to be - great. You said Bitcoins can be split up into fractions, and we can distribute those tiny fractions to people. Okay. And since you own half a Bitcoin, I'm assuming that half would be worth a lot.""

Me: Yes.

""Okay. That makes perfect sense. Now, imagine the following: You said the number of available Bitcoins is limited. What, 15 million of them? Okay. And you obtain them by mining, which is just borrowing your computer essentially and letting the computer do the work. It processes the transactions, and people's incentives to do this is that they might or might not get a Bitcoin, or if they're in a group, they get a part of the reward. Correct?""

Me: Yes.

**""Well, son, what happens when every single Bitcoin has been mined and Bitcoin is global? How do the transactions get processed at that point? There is no more incentive to mine, and so a vast majority of these miners will simply stop. Sure, maybe a sucker or two will continue to mine for the sake of the system - but do you honestly think the last remaining suckers will be able to handle the disgustingly enormous amount of transactions that Bitcoin will receive everyday should it become global? There is no chance that they will.""

Me:Uhhhhhhhhhh.... I'm sure the miners would think of a solution.

""No, no. We're already here. Lets think of one ourselves. Let us see, oh I have a great idea, lets increase the number of Bitcoins that can be mined when we get to that point. Say, another 15 million of them?""**

Me: I guess that could be a solution.

""But at that point, hasn't Bitcoin become what it doesn't want to be? It would be no different than the federal reserve of the United States. Bitcoin is destined to become what it hates and that is why it is destined to fail.""**

**TL;DR**: If all Bitcoins are mined and Bitcoin becomes global, miners have no incentive to mine any further. Thus, number of miners will collapse. Thus, causing the last remaining miners to not be able to handle all of the global BTC transactions. A possible solution to this would be to increase the number of BTC mineable, but then Bitcoins fall prey to one of the key problems which makes it attractive to some people",cryptocurrency,1389769131

But I have $200 taken out for health, dental and vision insurance taken out of my paycheck every month. It hurts to have that much taken out. It covers both of us. 

Back in June of 2011 our car died. We did  not have thousands of dollars in our savings and really bad credit due to the bankruptcy that was finalized the year before in 2010. It was mostly due to medical bills not credit cards. 

So in July of 2011. We walked into a car stealership and walked out a few hours later with our 2008 Mazda Tribute and a car loan. I really really really wish did not do that. But we weren't sure what to do. No money in savings, we couldn't get anyone to let us borrow their car. We actually were surprised that we got approved for a car loan.  

Here are the harsh details of the car loan: 
14.4 interest rate. We still owe $12,000 on it. The car is valued at the low end $5,000 and at the high end $8,000 dollars. The car loan is through Capital One Auto Finance. 

Capital One Auto Finance WILL NOT let us refinance through them. Oh by the way if the finance manager at the stealership tells you that you can refinance a year later with a better interest rate and a lower monthly payment. It's  LIE!!! I won't be making that mistake ever again. Because our next car WILL NOT have a car loan attached to it. 

We did try to refinance with our credit union about six months ago. Due to our bad credit but mostly because the car loan was upside down.

I have been paying off private student loans for about a year now, and have two completely paid off, four still to go. I was going through them highest interest rate first. BUT, and hear me out on this.



This is what I'm left with for private loans (still have about ~30k in federal loans, but they are set up on IBR and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, at the moment with a $0 payment..I just re-submitted certification for those, and haven't heard about if this year I will have a payment, or if it will still be $0)

Anyway:

* Wells Fargo @ 6.65% 50.03 Min. 5,266 ten day payoff
* AES @ 3.92 51.22 Min. 7,903 ten day payoff
* AES2 @ 5.67% 170.54 23,011 ten day payoff


With minimums included I am making a total payment of $1315 per month. This is almost 75% of my take-home pay. But, I want to get rid of these things as quickly as possible. 


Using unburyme.com, whatsthecost.com and mint.com, all say I will be debt free by October of 2016. 


My thinking was of course, pay highest interest rate first, rinse and repeat. I got my 9.25 loans paid off, and now the part that seems to make sense to me, but not sure if it makes sense in the long run.


I work for a grant run program, we re-write our grant every five years to see if we get funded (from US. Dept. of Ed.). Our program has been funded successfully for ~ 30 years. I wasn't here when they wrote last, but they didn't hear word until two weeks after our last funds ran out. So, they went two weeks without pay. And this has never happened before to any of the TRiO funded programs before. 
We were re-funded....but we write again next year (2015). I'm worried that we might not get re-funded...so I want to pay off loans as quickly as possible and with the interest rates on all of them pretty similar...over the course of my repayment I will only pay ~220 more in interest, but still pay them off the same month I would have by doing interest order. This way, if I lose my job...and can't find one quickly I only have the one payment to make instead of two. And our grant funds run out Oct 1, 2015. So...I'd just have one more payment to go either way...but I think more or less...it would make me feel better to pay off two loans this year. One next year, and the big one in 2016. If I do interest order, two this year, none in 2015, and two the last year...going a whole year without paying one loan off...it would not feel good.


Does this make sense to you guys at all? Am I over-thinking this whole thing?

Our offer was for $349,000 and we're planning to put 10% down with a traditional 30 year mortgage. Our lender gave us two options for PMI, we can take a slightly higher interest rate (my brother used the same lender and it was .125% higher), or pay normal PMI which will make our payments higher up front until the loan is at 78% of the value.

Doing some research, the nice thing about the higher rate is that it's all counted as a mortgage payment so we can deduct it - we can't deduct PMI. We also don't plan to stay in this home for more than 5-7 years, so my thought was that having the lower monthly payments would benefit us over that time span.

I'm posting this more as a discussion than for specific advice. I don't know what our rates would be (can't lock anything in until the bank approves our offer).

January 15, 2014

I was surprised how much I enjoyed the book, and how I agree with many (not all) of Jim Cramer’s discussions. I gave this book a 10/10 rating. I rate each book I read, and am up to 271 books read since I started tracking. I have read quite a few books more than once and some more than twice. Please let me know if you would like my spreadsheet of the books I have read.

These notes are hardly all inclusive. I merely am identifying several of the sections, which I will perhaps refer to in the future, or will use as a reminder of sorts. I have occasionally put in my own explanation or thoughts after citing what Jim Cramer wrote. Please excuse any unintentional errors.


1. If there is just one conference call to listen to it would be Caterpillar. CAT gives you the entire view of the world economy. If CAT can’t sell their wares, then perhaps no one is buying. He writes, “CAT works as the perfect “tell” of the world economy, because it makes the world’s best product and it is acknowledged globally.” I am certainly going to try this in the future. I monitor world economies and freight loadings. I primarily do this via subscriptions at aar.org, daily readings and Barron’s.

2. He also likes to read about the electricity usage in China. He does this via Joy Global. JOY is CAT’s biggest mining equipment competitor. He likes to use it as a proxy to China’s economy, especially since many do not trust the Governmental releases of China.

3. Alcoa also gives a fantastic read of how the world is doing.

4. Four other companies to judge the global economy are General Electric, Honeywell, 3M and United Technologies. These companies fill in the blanks from the others previously mentioned.

5. Of course he likes to pay attention to UPS and FedEx. I say of course, because we pay close attention to shipping and freight loads. We also pay attention to electricity usage.

6. He proceeds to build a large list of companies you could follow. Basically he mentions the leaders of each industry.

7. Measure a company’s growth with that of its own sector and the rest of the world.
8. You can buy a company after analysts cut estimates. Not all earnings estimate cuts are a signal of bad things to come. Some cuts signal market bottoms.

9. Don’t touch that core holding. He has learned often from his mistakes, whereas he has strategized that he would keep a company through thick and thin, and then often violates that rule. He claims it is almost always a mistake. I concur on all counts. Yet, sometimes a sale of a core holding is done to make room for other holdings. Most of our holdings are intended to be held “forever,” yet of course that is impossible for all holdings.

10. Buy the best of breed.

11. Be opened minded.

12. If your thesis changes, sell the stock. Yet, I ask, what if it is a core holding (see above)? Don’t create a new thesis. I always try to practice this. Yet, you need to invert and always question potential subconscious internal bias or unknowingly kidding yourself (remember Aesop and ‘The Fox and the Grapes.’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes . We use a checklist and always check to see if the thesis is changing.

13. Watch for ETF induced volume and hence price swings. You can take advantage of that.

14. Sector woes = Sell

15. Retailing: Bad comparable store numbers mean sell. The exception to this is when the entire sector reports negative numbers. “I can count on one hand the retailers that were able to pull out of extended periods of negative comps.” Watch out for sudden deceleration of from a high comparable sales level to a low one. One month can be explained, extended periods are concerning. Another thought of mine is that same store sales are sometimes masked with different methods of computing or the determination of same store sales when the retailer is in the midst of many stores opening during the year. Just something to watch.

16. Keep your emotions out of investing.

personalfinance,Interesting student loan situation,"I have a few student loans with different interest rates. I also have about $12,000 saved up. I had a college fund that I was using to pay for school, in combination with loans. I chose to keep the money and borrow instead in case I didn't get a job right after I graduated because being 22 and homeless with a college degree would suck. In the event that I got a job after graduation (which I did), I planned to pay off the loans I took before they accrued much interest (which I did for a few of the highest interest ones.)

I was trying to quantify how good of a decision it would be to spend that money on my loans rather than keep it invested. I ran some calculations today, and got an interesting result. Here are my assumptions:

Invested money makes 5%/year (conservatively invested, mostly fixed income, all investment-grade funds or assets.)

Loan budget: $700/month

Length of study: 120 months

Assume $700/month is off limits for spending on anything but loans or investments.

Assume monthly compounding.

$3500 principal, 5.35% interest, 10 year term, $38.49 minimum

$4500 principal, 4.25% interest, 10 year term, $47.04 minimum

$1000 principal. 4.25% interest, 10 year term, $10.45 minimum

$5500 principal, 3.15% interest, 10 year term, $54.60 minimum

$5500 principal, 3.15% interest, 10 year term, $54.60 minimum


Scenario 1: Put $12,000 towards the 7.9% interest loan. Then prioritize payments on the highest interest loans first, all the way down to the lowest interest. Do not invest until loans are completely paid off. This allows me to be debt free in 39 months, after which I would invest $700 per month. Balance after 120 months: $68,225.

Scenario 2: Keep the $12,000 investment balance. Pay down all loans before adding to investment account. Debt free after 59 months, then put away $700/month for the remaining 61 months. Balance after 120 months: $69,099.81.

Scenario 3: Keep $12,000 investment balance. Pay down the highest interest (7.9%) and second-highest interest (5.35%) loans. This is done by month 44. Then only pay the minimums on the remaining loans, and put the remainder away in the investment account. This would mean that for the remaining 76 months, I'd be paying $163.32 in minimum payments and putting away $536.68 per month. Balance after 120 months: $67,564.87

Scenario 4: Keep the investment balance. Pay off the 7.9% loan first, then the 5.35% loan, then both the 4.25% loans (highest principal first). This is done by month 47. Remaining minimums amount to $106.98. Divert remaining $593.02 into my investment account for the remaining 73 months. Balance after 120 months: $70,087.21.

____________________________________________________________________________________


So as I understand it, the conventional knowledge would align with Scenario 1. Put all your ""extra"" money towards your highest interest loan, even if you won't be able to pay it off in one go, because you'll ""save"" the most money in the long run. But that's obviously not optimal in my case. Also, it's surprising that it's more optimal to pay off loans that have an interest rate that's *lower* than the assumed return on invested money, but not optimal to pay off all loans before investing. Basically, because this is a non-linear optimization problem, it's A LOT more complicated than just paying off highest interest loans first. And my model used a very simple logic for which loans to pay off and when.... 

I'm interested to hear what people think of this, because it seems to fly in the face of most advice given on this subreddit regarding student loans vs. savings.",finance,1389809745

personalfinance,Took out a car loan 3 months ago. Now I want to pay it off. Will this hurt credit score?,"I took out a 36 month car loan about 3 months ago and I could pay it all off right now if I wanted to. One of the reasons I took the loan out was to build my credit history because my history was limited. I made a down payment of ~$15,000 on the car. The loan has a balance of $5,000 with a 2.5% interest rate (no prepayment penalty).

Now that I have had the car loan for a few months, I am now realizing that I miss the feeling of being debt-free. I am willing to keep the loan open for a while longer (8-12 months) and pay the interest if in the end it will greatly improve my credit score or would hurt my credit score by paying it off this early. 

I am wondering if I screwed myself by now wanting to pay off the loan when I purposely took out the loan to improve my credit score? If I pay it off, how will this affect my credit score and history? Will it help my score/history at all for having a closed installment loan on my history (even if it was open for only 3-6 months)? - or would it hurt it? Would it be beneficial to have the loan open for at least a specific amount of time (I have heard at least 6 months)?

Please note that I have no other debts, have an established emergency fund, and am making retirement contributions.

Bitcoin,Partial transcript of Andreas Antonopoulos' presentation at the LA Bitcoin Meetup - This dude's spoken words need to be circulated in writing more often.,"One of my favorite people in Bitcoin is Andreas Antonopoulos. He has a rare combination of CS brilliance, eloquence and authenticity that makes him IMO Bitcoin's greatest evangelist and champion. 

I took the time to write-up a partial transcript of Andreas' recent presentation on Bitcoin at the LA Bitcoin Meetup, because the full presentation with Q&amp;A is 90 minutes long.  I've included what I thought were his most eloquent and concise points because it's important to get some of his spoken words on paper, and because I'm going to use a lot of his points when educating others about Bitcoin.  I would vote for Andreas in a heartbeat if he ran for any type of public office, and have an enormous amount of professional respect for the dude, although I've only met him in passing.  I have edited for clarity and length.  Mistakes/omissions are my own, brilliance is attributable to Andreas.

Enjoy!

On the Irrelevance of Bitcoin's Flaws:
""Bitcoin is not perfect, but it's good enough.  And when you have a tech that achieves network scale and can be distributed over a large network, good enough suddenly becomes perfect, not because it is perfect, but because it enables the kind of innovation that makes it sticky, that starts accelerating the network effect.  And Bitcoin has some of the strongest network effects ever seen.  Why?  Because it's money.  The literal value of the network can increase exponentially."" 


On the Superiority of Decentralized Systems:  
""Nature doesn't do hierarchical systems, humans do.  And normally we create hierarchical systems to solve the problems of scale.  Bitcoin solves one of the main problems of hierarchical systems, which is that the people who rise to the top become corrupted and gradually subvert the hierarchical system to serve their own needs.  Hierarchical systems don't scale and they don't deliver equality for very long.  Decentralized systems scale and as long as the rules they are based on operate, they can level the playing field for all participants.  If you can put a decentralized system next to a hierarchical system and people have a choice to choose between the two, the decentralized system will always deliver more value to every node within the network, and it will do so with better accountability, better predictability, less uncertainty, less risk, and it is much harder to corrupt and coopt, and now we're doing it to money for the first time in history.  That's a very big deal."" 


On Bitcoin as a Global Reserve Currency: 
""In North America, we have the world's reserve currency.  It's a good, stable currency.  A lot of libertarians and Austrian economists will say: ""The dollar sucks."" Yes, the dollar sucks, but it sucks 193 times less than the other 193 other currencies.  So when we ask why does Bitcoin matter in North America, the answer is: it doesn't.  It matters far more in every other place in the world.  You go to Argentina; their currency is devaluing at 30% per year.  People's savings are disappearing before their eyes. Their futures are being stolen by a central bank.  For these people, Bitcoin is a choice that allows them to achieve economic independence. We would love to have economic independence here, because our financial system is f***ed up and corrupt, but compared to the rest of the world, it's easy.  It's great.""  


Bitcoin as a Force for Social Good:
""Bitcoin is really all about the other 6 billion people.  About 3 billion people have no bank accounts.  About 1 billion people have ample access to credit and large pools of liquidity, so they can start businesses, buy homes, etc. They have access to international finance, transferring money and conducting international trade without many restrictions.  The middle 3 billion may have bank accounts, but those bank accounts have currency controls, and those people don't have the ability to do international trade. They are stuck in a currency controlled by a central bank that uses inflation as a means to steal from the people.  Essentially inflation becomes a form of taxation. 

This stolen money usually goes to buy guns and tanks and bombs, which is why I'm in Bitcoin.  In the state of human affairs, if you ask a nation to divest its wealth in order to fund war, the only way you can do that is by stealing, by lying, by cheating. If you ask for the consent of the governed to fund war, they will say no.  They would rather fund healthcare, education or development.  So when you have a currency that is not subject to central bank control, you achieve separation of money and state. You take away the power of state to use money as a means of control and enrichment. Until now, each government was able to apply control through money, by issuing it, taxing in that money and controlling the flow of money into and out of that country. Bitcoin is not the 194th currency, it is the first global currency.  It is the first algorithmic currency.  We can trust mathematics because we can predict exactly what will happen on the Bitcoin network.

We have the opportunity, not to bank the other 6 billion, but to unbank all 7 billion of us.  We have the opportunity to allow the developing world to leapfrog directly from cash-based societies to digital cash societies and bypass the entire failed experiment of central currencies from the western world.  They will take the opportunity just like they leapfrogged landlines and went directly to cellphones.""


On Governments' Inability to Stop Bitcoin:
""You cannot stop money that is information.  Stopping bitcoin would involve shutting down the internet.  I truly believe that Bitcoin is absolutely unstoppable from external perspectives today.  That doesn't mean that it will survive.  It means that if we f*** it up, it will fail from the inside.  There are certain failure modes that bitcoin could exhibit today, probably the most serious would be a bug that allows someone to subvert the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm in a way that wouldn't be noticed for a long time, in which case you wouldn't know who owns what.  That could crash bitcoin."" 


On Global Remittance Innovation:
One of the most exciting financial solutions is the ability of the payment networks to do peer-to-peer payments, the most important of which is global remittances. Global remittances are a $510bn market, where migrant workers send that money back home to support families in the poorest nations in the world.  Today, Western Union and similar companies extract $74 billion in fees for those services.  Even as the developed world provides $150 billion in direct foreign aid to the top of the pyramid in the hopes that it trickles down, we steal $74 billion from the base of the pyramid.  That money could go to sanitation, clean water, healthcare, food.  This is not our money, it's theirs, and it just means we need to take it away from Western Union.  And that couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of crooks.""


On whether 51% attacks are something to worry about:
""The 51% attack is an interesting theoretical experiment with limited practical uses.  If you were to take over 51% of the network you would be able to successfully issue a double spend attack, but you could really only affect the next couple of blocks.  [So the economics of a 51% don't really make sense.]  Besides that, Gavin Andresen (the lead core Bitcoin developer) would make changes to the core protocol in the event that the integrity of the block chain was threatened."" 


On whether we should worry about SHA-256 Failing (the underlying security algorithm on which Bitcoin is based):
""The hashing algorithm can be replaced, with a minimal impact on the blockchain, but very big impact on the miners.  But practically speaking, if SHA-256 were to break, we would have much bigger problems.  Because it underlies security of all financial systems, and all of our communications networks...and the tomahawk cruise missile codes.""",cryptocurrency,1389814642

Oh the joy and exhilaration that occurred when the first GUI-based miner program fired up and started flashing text across the window.  Then that moment passed.  And then another.  When finally it was realized that nothing was happening and that all hope is lost.


In the bitter mire of despair a quick sideways glance at this ""lighter"" coin, Litecoin, provided a ray of hope.  Upon finding easier to read instructions on how to mine, the curious one set out to make his smaller fortune.  The mining computer was setup overnight and a peaceful rest and a future of joyous coin danced in his head.  Before the sun could chase this dreamer away, he was up with a jolt, as he ran for the treasures.  But those who have traveled this fateful journey before already know the end of this troubling tale.  The screen flickered on and before his eyes, stood the number zero-zero, in all their bold glory.


With two failed stabs at lightning in a bottle, our curious one found an online site with many, many others.  There were coins for the bettors, coins for the rappers, and coins for some dude named Fedora.  Coins that were Lucky and coins for the Hobos, and one little coin that smiled through its fur.


Our curious adventurer dove down the rabbit trail and found a new site that showed him to mine.  Quicker than he could look up from his monitor but 14 little Doge coins stood beaming back at him.  From that moment on he ran forward with gusto as he joined the community that supported the coin.


Fast forward to now and we see our doge addict, loving the chase of more doge for his wallet.  But the chase doesn't end with a plink of deposit but the constant opportunity to show others the joy of the Doge.  The fun had with others while shopping with Doge and the knowledge once learned must be passed on to others.  And thus ends the story of the curious one who drives on ahead with his addiction in tow.

personalfinance,Credit considerations buying first house - FHA and CC piggyback Q's,"Hi PF

I am looking to buy our first home in Washington State (central WA area), and looking for a bit of advice or suggestions.

Quick stats:

* 30 years old 
* 75k/yr Income (~4600 monthly take home)
* 10k savings
* Just under 4k debt (1k cc, 3k used car)
* House price range - 150k-215k 

Long story short, we had been happily renting and saving - and the homeowners needed the house back. We moved in temporarily with my parents to pay off debts, improve our credit, and buy a house - over about 8 month time frame. We worked with a lender to get us on track for buying a house, and found that our credit was trashed (our stupidity/negligence of how credit works, almost entirely from late notices) - into the 500's and would need to improve it before we could get qualified. We worked on our terrible credit, and got up it to 'ok' (~675), paid off all of our debts except 1 car, 1 cc (we are on track to have the CC paid off before we leave). We are getting close to the end of the 8 months and spring is almost here, so its time to get started on this again.  We are interested in the FHA 3.5% down loan. From what I have read online the minimum FICO to qualify for this loan seems to be 620-640ish. 

I am extremely happy and stable in my job, in a good industry, with great people. I have a solid, steadily rising salary and I can see myself retiring from this organization easily. I have no plans or interest in leaving the area, and have always wanted to own a home. Renting *is* an option for us, but more of a last resort - I would really like to see us get into a house. We are looking at the FHA, 3.5% down loans. There are some USDA rural loans in this area but they seem to be very farm-focused (large farm/ag industry area). 

I would really like to get advice or suggestions on:

* Is the FHA loan going to be our best bet as first time buyers with a low down payment? Does your FICO score have any determination on the interest rate you get with this loan?

* Would it be advantageous to piggyback on a good standing, long history, credit card of a friend or family member? (both with FICO scores over 800 and great credit history) I heard the effectiveness of this had been reduced or eliminated.

* If yes to above, is it helpful to add multiple cards? (i.e have someone add me as an AU to all 10 of their cards as opposed to 1)

* If yes above is it possible to raise your FICO score any significant amount over the course of 2-3 months?

The short story:

-30/M/USA

-$110k/yr income.

-$30k credit card debt on one card @ 15%.

-$22k in a 401k.

-$10k in an investment account.

-$2k in liquid savings.

This credit card debt is killing me.  I know my problem is spending but I've cut down a lot.  I still somehow spend $2k on it/mo since it's the only card I use for everything but I am paying down $2500/mo.  Given the interest rate, around $300-400/mo adds on in interest which means I'm not really chipping away at it.

I want to get it out of the way before making my next big life choice.  (I want to propose to my gf.)  Would it be best to wipe it out with my 401k and investments?  Or given my ability to handle maybe $1k/mo more in bills, should I consolidate it?  If so, with who?  Lending Club is offering me a loan around 12% for a $26k loan.

Any advice appreciated.  Thank you.

edit:  Thank you to everyone who is taking their time to give me advice.  It's greatly appreciated.  As I mentioned in the comments, I realize that spending is problem #1.  Much of it is due to the fact that I'm a functioning alcoholic and another personal health issue leads me to be impulsive and unable to control myself at times.  It looks like there's no easy out with the ideas I came up with and I will need to first solve the root issues.  Thanks again.",finance,1389827774

personalfinance,I paid for 25k of my federal college loans with a USAA loan @ a lower interest rate. Bad idea? How to move forward?,"Long story short, when I was a freshly commissioned military officer, I was barely financially literate and getting paid a whole lot of money (way more than my parents, anyway) for the first time. I didn't do anything wildly bad; I bought a car out of my price range with a loan, and spent way more than I should have in general, etc. The usual. 

But the worst I think I did was pay off my school loans with a private loan. I had read and heard that paying for my higher interest rates loans with a lower interest loan would be a good idea, so I went ahead and paid for my ~$25k in federal school loans (which were at around 6-8%) with the USAA ""Cadet Starter Loan"", which at the time was $25k @ 2.95%. I figured that this was a sweet deal in the long run, since I had a pretty secure job...but let's just say that I was wrong, and it's far from guaranteed that I'll be an officer until I repay this loan (in 2018, or whenever in the far-flung future).

So what I'm worried about now is that if I'm separated from the military for whatever reason,  USAA will be much less understanding about my inability to pay for my loan than the government would have been (forbearance/income-based repayment was pretty sweet!). In addition, I've heard that in the fine print (which yes, I should have read closer) it says that the interest rate could go up to as much as 20% if I leave the military! 

Any advice for how I can get as financially secure as possible given my current position is very much appreciated! Specifically: Where can I look to save more money? And should I put more money towards loan repayment?

investing,Questions on liquidity and peanlties of a Roth IRA,"I've been a little slow on the investment thing and am just getting started. I've zeroed out all my CC's, car loan, and have a nice nest egg of cash and want to make my money work for me a little.

I currently do not have a Roth IRA. I would like to set one up through Vanguard tomorrow and invest my max $5,500 in a couple ETFs.

My question is this: How liquid is the money in my Roth IRA?
The $5500 that I stick in there tomorrow, I see that I do not pay penalties on my contributions, so that's good; but I pay a 10% federal penalty tax on any earnings that I withdraw?

The reason I am asking is because I am saving to buy a house soon.


**Scenario 1**: I put $5500 in a roth IRA, 8 months from now, it's worth $5700 (yay!). I decide to buy a house, withdraw my $5,700. Would the 10% penalty I'd be paying on the $200 earnings be more or less than if I had just invested in the same ETFs through a Vanguard brokerage account and paid tax on it (15%?) Or am I penalized AND taxed (this would suck).

**Scenario 2:** Same as above, I put in my $5500, it goes up to $5,700, but now I only withdraw $5,500. Is there any penalty? (ie. Did I just withdraw my $5,500 contribution, or did I just withdraw my $200 earnings + $5,300 contribution?)",finance,1389836980

**Bitcoin Bubble or Bitcoin Breakthrough? How about both?**

by Elliott Prechter

December 20, 2013 in the Elliott Wave Theorist


EWT discussed Bitcoin for the first time in August 2010, when the currency traded at six cents. As far
as we know, EWI was the first financial publisher to discuss it. Bitcoin was unknown to the general public
and off private investors’ radar. Even the earliest adopters did not take it as seriously as they should have. The most
notable example of this is the man who paid 10,000 BTC for a pizza. This pizza purchase is now famous
(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=l37.0), and many continue to track its price in USD terms via the
“Bitcoin Pizza Index,"" which recently hit an all-time high of over S12 million.

Fast forward to today, and the currency is regularly featured in financial news and social media. Bitcoin
Magazine has become popular, Congress is holding hearings on the currency, Germany has defined its role
in finance, China is ruling on its legality, and the business world is adopting it. The most prominent business
to embrace Bitcoin is Virgin Galactic, one of the many creations of billionaire Richard Branson (http://www.cnbc.com/id/101220710).

EWT readers were prepared for all this. When Bitcoin was still in the shadows, the August 2012 issue
said,

&gt; Presuming bitcoin succeeds as the world’s best currency-and I believe it will-it should
rise many more multiples in value over the years. -EWT, August 2012

The big question on the minds of investors is not what Bitcoin has achieved, but should they buy Bitcoins
now? It’s amusing that so many people ignored Bitcoin upon hearing about it in 20 1 0, but now that its price
has gone up 20,000 times, they want to invest. Notwithstanding the currency’s potential, this shift in attitude
is a signal saying now is not the time to buy. Let’s look at four areas of evidence:

1) Optimism is off the charts. Past issues of The Elliott Wave Financial Forecast discussed people
selling their homes and borrowing money to invest in Bitcoins. That was near the peak of wave Now
the desire to buy has grown even more extreme. Bloggers are calling for Bitcoin to reach S1 million. . .soon.
One young investor borrowed a million dollars from his father and without his knowledge invested it in
Bitcoin (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=359228.0). The other day I walked into a convenience store
wearing a Bitcoin T-shirt, and the owner asked me if he should invest now. I felt like I was living in 1929.

2) Investors have recently been rushing to buy a rash of 95 (at last count; see https://bitcointalk.
org/index.php?topic=l34179.0) new clones of Bitcoin that have recently emerged: Litecoin, Namecoin,
Zerocoin, BBQCoin, PPcoin, PrimeCoin, NovaCoin, FeatherCoin, TerraCoin, Devcoin, Megacoin, Mincoin,
DigitalCoin, Anoncoin, Worldcoin, Freicoin, IxCoin... and more. (That they are clones is obvious from
the lack of imagination in naming.) This rush of clones is reminiscent of the South Sea bubble of 1720 and
the dot-com mania of 1999, when shares of zero-profit, copycat companies (and even fake ones) sold like
hotcakes. Virtually every week now, the Bitcoin code is forked into a new coin that investors bid up. lt’s
as if buyers feel the world will run out of cryptocurrency, which in fact is infinitely and freely duplicable.

3) The Elliott wave pattern from Bitcoin’s inception shows five waves up. The December ll Short
Term Update noted that a major top was potentially in place:
The peak [in Bitcoin] came 10 days after U.S. officials, ranging from an assistant attorney general

virtual currencies."" So, here again, the government is getting on board at the very tail end ofa long rise.
Since we posted that comment, Bitcoin has fallen an additional 40%, bringing it down nearly 60% from its
all-time high.

Will this prove to be just another brief, sharp correction or something larger? Take a look at the completed
impulse pattern shown in Figure 3. The structure begins very near the inception of the currency three-plus
years ago, when it was selling for a penny. Notice that wave @ is a triangle (see text, p.49), which typically
comes in the fourth-wave position. Wave a thrust, carried to the all-time high of S 1242 on November 29.
The reversal from that point should mark the start of the largest bear market to date in the currency.
This forecast is in tune with the anticipated bear market in the broader stock averages, which have
strongly correlated with Bitcoin’s pattern.

The chart is in log scale to show the returns one would have achieved in each impulse leg of the pattern.
Wave Q) achieved a stunning 3 19ox gain. Wave ® achieved 59.3% (a Fibonacci 3/5) of the gain of wave Q).
Wave ® (measured from the low of wave @) achieved 39.3% (a Fibonacci 2/5) of the gain of wave (D
and 66.3% (a Fibonacci 2/3) of the gain of wave Therefore, while each upward move has been large,
each successive wave has been decelerating in log terms relative to past waves, in each case by a Fibonacci
multiple. Also notice that Bitcoin trades more like a commodity than a stock, with its blow-off tops and
extended fifih waves. Most of the gain since early 20 12 has been within (5) of ® and the final wave all
of which is probable retracement territory.

4) Most people involved in this mania seem oblivious to Bitcoin’s fundamentals. In my experience, raising
these issues publicly earns scorn for spreading “FUD.” But there is a good reason-now widely ignored-that
Bitcoin is beta software. Our August 2010 piece explained how Bitcoin operates,
but it’s worth revisiting some details to understand just how out-of-touch investor
expectations are with the reality of Bitcoin technology. Specifically, let's examine
the limitations of Bitcoin’s blockchain.

The blockchain is the heart of Bitcoin. In its simplest form, the blockchain is
a public ledger of all transactions that happen in the Bitcoin network. Each block
is composed of individual records that track the ownership of each coin. The transactions “fit” together
cryptographically. A block is created about once every 10 minutes by the network. Each block is then
cryptographically linked to the previous blocks in the chain, forming a history of all transactions that-to
Bitcoin’s credit-cannot be forged. To the extent that Bitcoin currency is real, it could be said that the
blockchain is the Bitcoin currency.

Yet the core problem with the blockchain is that it grows over time and must be shared by every fiill
Bitcoin node. Today it is nearing 13 GB in size. Now, 13 GB doesn't sound too large, but at the current
rates of exponential growth the blockchain is projected to become over a terabyte in size in just three years.
What's more, the amount of accompanying data required to handle just a fraction of Visa-level traffic would
overwhelm even the fastest Internet connections. This technical hurdle makes the “Bitcoin is going to a
million” commentary seem premature.

The hope for Bitcoin’s future lies in its open-source nature, allowing it to be improved, and Moore’s
Law. Moore’s Law is colloquially used to signify the exponential increases in computer-hardware efficiency
over time, including network capacity. But Moore’s law-which calls for a doubling of computer speed
every two years-has hit a snag in recent years: the rate of improvement in performance has dramatically
slowed, causing many experts to call for the end of the operation of Moore’s law. (For the
record, Moore’s Law was never intended to refer to computer hardware performance, but the media have
confused the term to the point where it is now generally used in this context. Originally, it was intended to
refer to the increase in the number of transistors that are packed into microchips.)

The past four years have been an exciting ride for Bitcoin. But the evidence says the Bitcoin bull
market is done for now. It would be best to put Bitcoin out of your mind for the duration of the deflationary
wave that is curling toward the financial world. Due to the psychology surrounding Bitcoin, as well as its
correlation with the stock indices, it is too risky to buy now. Due to its open-source nature, however, Bitcoin’s
infrastructure should continue to improve over the years.

For the long run, I agree with Roger Ver, the CEO of memory dealers and one of Bitcoin’s earliest
adopters, who recently said, “It is just getting started."" But one could have said that about the U.S. stock
market in 1966. It would have been visionary only if you were patient and willing to hold through a very
deep valley. Our position is that Bitcoin will never again sell for 6 cents, as it did when EWT first wrote it
up. But there will be another time to buy it for relative peanuts alongside stocks, real-estate, gold and silver.
When the time comes, no one will be interested.

I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit and you guys seem very helpful at providing advice.

Here are my outstanding student loan (not exact values, but very close). Loan are currently in deferment (wife started working a few months ago) and trying to decide the best course of action - Wife and I are both mid/late 20s.

personalfinance,Questions about understanding tax brackets and retirement accounts,"I'm trying to determine whether I should open an IRA or a Roth IRA. I'm not lazy, I've done a lot of research myself but am still confused and need someone to hold my hand while I walk through what I think I know.  

To make this decision, I first need to know what percentage of my income I am currently paying in taxes, right? (I live in New York State) Do I simply look at my paycheck stub and do the ol'   is/of = %/100   ? If so, then it looks like I am paying a total of 19.98% of my income to state and federal.  

How do tax brackets work into this, are they only used to determine how much you're taxed when you're withdrawing money in retirement? Or am I missing something about the tax bracket I'm currently in?  

I shouldn't have a problem maxing out the $5,500/yr contribution. I'm 25 years old and make $48,000/yr, and currently paying 20% of that to taxes. The current tax bracket in 2014 is 25% on taxable income between $36,900 and $89,350. So if I'm living the same lifestyle and want to keep my income the same after I retire and withdraw $48,000/yr that means that I will then be charged 25% on that money vs. 20% that I could pay on the same money right now. Meaning that I'd rather pay the taxes now rather than later, so a Roth IRA *would* be better, correct?  

But this doesn't account for how much money I'll be making 10, 20, 30 years, I don't know if I'll have a spouse and what her contributions might be, and as far as I know, we don't know for certain what the tax brackets will be in about 35 years.  

I get the feeling that it might be better to just max out that $5,500/yr in a Roth IRA, pay the taxes now, and have the *ability to possibly* avoid a higher tax bracket. If I were to do that what are the chances that it would end up being a bad move and I would end up paying significantly higher taxes on that money now than I would in retirement?

Let's say it cost $170,000 (and appraised for the same at the time) and the mortgage is currently $152,000.  I have the lowest interest rate possible so refinancing is out of the question.  The appraised value is well under the average home value for my neighborhood because I got a great deal due to the fact that it was bank owned and formerly owned by a hoarder.  I've cleaned up the yard, cleaned up the house, painted etc.  Now I want to do some more work but don't have the money.

In order to get a HEL I would have to get a reappraisal.  Problem is that I need the money to finish the kitchen, which I've already torn out.  

So, my questions are:

Will the current state of the kitchen have a huge effect on the outcome of the new appraisal (i.e. is it even worth spending the money for the appraisal?)?

If I can't get an appraised value high enough for a HEL what are my other options?

Is it worth it to put the renovations on a credit card for now and get a HEL to pay off the CC once the renos are finished? (because I can get a more favorable appraisal after completion of the kitchen)

Is a HELOC an option in this case?

personalfinance,25 y/o starting a new job -- advice for my state of finances?,"I hope this isn't against the rules, but I'm reposting this because I didn't get much feedback last time. I'm just looking for any general criticism or advice for my current state of finances and what goals I should be working toward. 

To give you some context on the numbers, I just moved to a new state to start a new job at the end of this month. I am 25, single, live in VA, no kids, and in good health.

##Assets

- ~**$1,500** cash

- ~**$4,900** HP stock (purchased when I was younger and dumber, total value is 40% less than what I purchased it for)

- ~**$5,800** Vanguard Roth IRA (target year fund), of which $5,000 I put in last year

- 2014 Honda CRV (can't get a market price for this online, I could only find new purchase price estimates)

- **$500** Accounts Receivable - leftover from my business, which I closed for my new job.

##Liabilities

- Credit Cards: **$3,500** (this is high because of a one-time $2,500 down payment on my car, furniture purchases, and paying my 6-month auto policy in full)

- Car Loan: **$20,000**

- Personal Loan: **$27,000** (owe this to my parents for school) and **$1,500** (borrowed for rental deposit). I have flexibility with these in terms of monthly payment and loan length.

###Income

- **$68,200** per year starting at the end of this month.  The net pay I estimated after taxes and deductions is **$4,130** per month (based on this calculator: http://www.paycheckcity.com/cokronos/netpaycalculator.asp). This income is fairly safe and I can expect a regular progression of raises. I will also receive free housing after a few years and possibly move to a country with a lower cost-of-living.

###Mandatory Expenses

The paycheck-related expenses don't start until the income starts, of course.

- Rent: **$1,500** per month

- Car payment: **$350** per month (0.9% interest for 60 months)

- Federal TSP (Retirement): **$284.29** per month (5% of gross, matched by employer)

- Health insurance (FEHB): **$104.18** per month (went with one of the cheaper options since I am young and in good health)

- Cable/Internet: **$97** per month (no contract, will rise to $117 next year)

## Budgeted expenses

- Transfer to emergency/savings fund: **$413** per month

- Groceries: **$350** per month (trying to be conservative)

- Gas: **$130** per month

- Dining out/coffee: **$210** per month

- Personal property tax: **$40** per month (I have to pay tax for having a car each year, not sure how much it will be yet so I estimated)

###My Goals

Although I don't have as urgent a need for an **emergency fund** as most people (who would need it at a time of job loss), I would still like to build one up for **6 months of expenses**.

I also have a goal of **$10,000 in liquid savings by July 2015** (arbitrary number, let me know if you have a better suggestion) to absorb big expenses like moving, which I will be doing very frequently over the course of my career.

As you can see, I have a big gap between assets and liabilities until I get my first paycheck. I am loath to borrow more from my parents, as I already owe them so much money. I was considering dipping into my Roth IRA contributions (up to $5,000 without penalties) to cover the shortfall. Since I can expect a pension and my 5% matched retirement savings, I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. Thoughts?

personalfinance,Finally got my first big boy job and filing taxes. Pleading ignorance. Please help,"Like expressed above, started a job in late April, making about 30K. November when my loans became active, my job started paying $833/month(before taxing it) for my stupid amount of loans. Overall, they have payed a little over 1K. I have a few questions about all of this stuff. 

1) Do people normally get money back, or should I be saving money to actively pay these taxes? 

2) Will I be able to claim my loan payments, since they are technically included in my pre-tax income? I have a 1098-E printed out, but don't know what I'm supposed to do with it.

4)Should I be looking for any deductions, or does that just create a clusterfuck? 

I appreciate the help and look forward to any advice to prepare for next year. 

edit: Regarding the loans, technically my contract is ~30K+10K that automatically goes to my federal student loans. All of it gets taxed, so instead of $833(10,000/12) going to my loans, only like $500 and some change goes to it. Due to this, I get quite a bit less in hand, due to all that money I never actually see getting taxed, but I guess I should be thankful my loans are getting considerably payed.",finance,1389898065

I just turned 27 earlier this week. I am currently funding a 403B through my employer, where the employer matches an additional 5.14%. On total amounts, I contribute 8.14% (3% is required, 5.14% of it is voluntary) of my own paycheck to my 403B every two weeks. Since I am a government employee, that is the maximum amount I can contribute. My employer matches 5.14% of it.

I also have a Roth IRA which I had rolled over from my old employer's 401(k) plan. It is currently in Vanguard's system. 

I have the option to contribute more, up to $17,000 per year in an additional 403B or 457 plan through my employer, as an optional retirement plan. This would be pre-tax, I believe? There are many places to put funds as well, with many different prospectus I need to read. For the most part, the average expense ratio of these funds are between .40 up to 1.00+ across the large vast amounts of funds. Edit: It looks like Vanguard's target funds are located in a ING Account and Jefferson National has some individual Vanguard stocks.

So I'd like to ask a few questions instead...

* Should I contribute to another plan through my employer? If not...
* Should I contribute to my Roth IRA versus paying down my student loan debt?
* If so, I currently have it set on a target retirement year fund. Should I change that?

I have some student loan debt I'd like to clear ASAP and should have most of this large $14,000 loan with a 7.25% interest rate cleared by the end of the year.

I was wondering if anyone had any starting advice for getting this under control, paying it off someday, and hopefully achieving some financial security. Any stories from people in similar situations would be incredibly helpful as I've been beyond stressed by this for a long time and don't know if it will ever get better. 

The details:

* **Loans:**  Originally took out around 90K in private and 40K in federal, but with the private loan currently in default and a high interest rate due to me being the only signer, it's probably ballooned an exceptional amount. I would just say to go with 200k in loans at this point, 160k of that being private. It might be even more, but I am honestly afraid to look.

* **Income:** Currently between jobs, but hoping to find one soon in the 35-45k range. That is about as much as I can expect with my skill set at the moment.

* **Living Expenses:** I'm single and live alone. When my lease is up I'm hoping to move someplace much cheaper, hopefully in the $300-400 a month range (probably a shared living space to get that low of a rent). Monthly expenses total about $700


I understand it's my job to pay this off, and I'm not making excuses for loans I took out, but I feel so trapped by decisions I made as an inexperienced 18 year old from a very poor family, with no financial literacy at all, being told college was my only option to escape being poor myself. I would do a million things differently now if I had the chance, but this is the set of circumstances I am currently dealing with.  I honestly feel like I should never have gone to school at all.

But what many don't realize it's that a certain amount of inflation is  beneficial to an economy as it encourages people to spend or invest instead of letting their money just sit and devalue and boosts money circulation. In addition, it makes trade more competitive when our currency and labor and cost of making goods is not ridiculously high. For example, Japan has had trouble over the last few years with deflation and the cost of Japanese goods and their government had to actively work to inflate their currency. So, while the money in your pocket may be less, I believe that controlled inflation helps the economy enough that it actually benefits you.

I'm gonna try to keep this a short as I can, but I could probably write a book on this one subject. 

I go to URI. Just finished my first semester there as a freshmen. Next semester starts on Tuesday. 

Most, if not all, of my friends have already enrolled in classes for the next semester. I can't, as I have a term bill hold. 

I'm maxed out on federal loans. Can't get a private loan because MY ENTIRE FAMILY HAS ADVERSE CREDIT. Credit so bad, it's like it's not even there. My dad declared bankruptcy thrice for example, and is homeless. 

My term bill for URI is ~$13500 for the fall 2013 semester. I got ~$11600 covered. The next semester I actually WILL be able to cover because I won't have to pay for health care. So I'm just behind on this semester. 



Basically the purpose of this goddamn question is to see if you guys think there's anyway URI will be able to like provide sympathy for me and lift my hold temporarily to at least let me enroll in classes. 

I mean, from their perspective, I've already paid 92% of my bill. Like, for example, they make $2700 per year per dorm (three kids to a dorm, 900$ each). The dorm is a simple 12ft by 10ft cell. Yea, they cover utilities, but no way does it cost $2700 to rent out a single room. Hell, you can rent out an apartment with utilities covered for $1000,and raise an entire family there. 

Point is, they are obviously profiting. Severely. They wouldn't want to LOSE ANOTHER $11,600 for the next semester from me/the government just because I'm a mere $2,000 short. And, I can pay it back. I have a job and I'm saving up money. I just don't have enough AT THE MOMENT. 

Do you think they could lift the hold to give me more time? Seriously. I can't believe they would do this. It just does not make sense to me, from either perspective of the spectrum. If they don't lift the hold, they are simultaneously losing money and destroying my dreams and aspirations. 

Dunno what to do here, seriously. 

Please don't suggest trying to get more federal loans or grants. I'm truly maxed out. I even have work study. 



Once again, do you think it is possible for them to temp. lift my hold so I can enroll in classes? Any advice of how I should speak to them? Should I like sob and cry? Be logical and reasonable? Beg? Be persistent? They're gonna say ""no"", but that's literally an answer I cannot accept. Should I request to speak from someone in enrollment services with higher power?

 Assume that this mortgage is amortized over 25 years. 
 
a) What are the monthly payments over the 5-year term of the mortgage? 
b) How much do you still owe three years after you took out this mortgage (i.e., immediately after you 
made the 36th monthly payment)? 
c) What is the principal portion of the 37th mortgage payment? 
d) What would be the bi-weekly payments (you would make payments once every two weeks) if you 
switched to bi-weekly payments right after you made the 36th monthly payment. Assume there is no 
penalty for switching and that the effective interest rate remains the same. Also assume that you 
would make bi-weekly payments for the remainder of the term, i.e., 22 years, and that a year has 
exactly 52 weeks. 
e) Suppose your bank offers you a car loan with a monthly compounded APR of 5.34%. Which of the 
two loans is “cheaper:” the mortgage or the car loan? Or are you paying the same effective interest 
rate on both?

OKAY so I suppose I have to find the Effective Annual Rate (EAR) then use it in a typical annuity formula to 1: convert the APR that accommodates for monthly compounding and 2: divide by 12 to find the monthly payments for question 1 A. After that, I'm puzzled on how to approach the next questions.",finance,1389920612

personalfinance,Retirement savings vs. student loan payments,"I'm not sure how to prioritize my retirement savings and student loan payments. The conventional wisdom is that you should preferentially pay down debt at an interest rate higher than 7%, and my student loans are 0.2% below that. Currently I'm only paying the minimum, on the theory that any more than this is throwing money away since I'll never be able to pay them off anyway--I'd be paying debt that will ultimately be forgiven anyway. I want you guys to tell me why I'm wrong about this. 

The deets: 

Income: $27,000/year gross at my primary job, with an annual cost-of-living adjustment of ~2%. No other raises or bonuses. I work a second job when possible but for the past few years I've only made an extra $2000 or so. 

Debt: $45,000 of student loans at 6.8%, all federal. No other debt. On the IBR plan I currently pay $170/month, which covers the interest and not a whole lot more, so the principal is just kind of hanging out. I can make voluntary payments above this amount, of course. Currently I'm 38 payments into the 120 I need for public service loan forgiveness, but if I have a chance to make more in the private sector I'll leave in a heartbeat--I have decent health insurance but I'm probably never going to make more than $14/hour here, I'm not learning any transferrable skills, and there's no possibility for advancement (requires a graduate degree in a field with awful prospects). Making $27,000/year for the next 6+ years--until I'm 43--sounds terrible, even if it makes my student loans go away. 

Retirement savings: At 35 I have $12,500 saved across a couple of retirement accounts (403b offered by my employer and a Roth IRA, and maybe a few hundred in various old PERS/401k accounts that I haven't rolled into something else). The IRA is through my credit union and was just re-invested at 0.7%, and I've temporarily stopped putting money into it, partially because I'm not 100% sure how IRAs work regarding the rate of return etc. Currently I contribute 22% of my gross income to the tax-deferred retirement account, and my employer matches 3%. 

The amount of money reaching my bank account after taxes/health insurance/403b is &lt;$19,000/year. This is very close to my fixed expenses, so I can't make higher student loan payments without directly stealing from my retirement. Because my income is on the low side, if I only contribute up to my 403b match, I'd be saving $810/year ($1620 with the match) which seems like dangerously little. 

What should I do?

EDIT: checked my accounts and the total is currently $12,500.",finance,1389921227

worldpolitics,THE 7th OF FEBRUARY IS THE DAY OF KURIL ISLANDS,"Prime minister of Japan is about to take part only in the closing ceremony of Sochi Olympic Games, as japan mass media says. He won’t be able to present at the opening because at that time in Japan the commemorating of so-called “The day of Northern Territories” is holding, where Sidzo Abe will address a meeting with ministers of the Cabinet and sitting members of Parliament.
As is known, from the 7th of February 1982  japans every year commemorate “The day of Northern Territories”. This day of all others the Treaty of Shimoda was consolidated  in 1855 the first Russian-Japan treaty, according to which Kuril Islands: Hump, Kunashire, Habomai and Shikotane were of Japan.
“The day of Northern Territories” – is not a holiday in Japan, it will be better to say that it is another reason to remind of territory problems with Russia. This day of all others full of information about territorian claims of Japan to Russian Federation which falls on ordinary civilians all over the world. All Japan political parties through the mass media agencies and streets contest in patriotic slogans.
In that day traditionally holds “national meeting for giving back northern territories”, in which Prime Minister and other politicians of all parties including opposition, former civilians of South part of Kuril Islands, take part. At those streets of Japan capital is full of ornament spiel trucks with slogans and militarist flags of radical groups with high-power dynamics plying between Japan parliament and Russian embassy. They broadcastwith maximum acceptable volume old military marches and claims to give back “Northern Territories” on broken Russian.
Among this, according to history and international right point of view these claims are absolutely illegal. In that way, professor of Russian Academy of Natural Science Koshkin A. consists that even in Japan believe that the first discovering, mapping and reclaiming of south Kuril Islands was made by Russians. At that time Japan was closed atate and even Hokkaido island was not Japan’s territory. In this context logic of  some Japan historians and politicians stays unclear who claim that Kuril Island is original Japan territory, when Hokkaido had not been Japan territory till the middle of the 19th century moreover territory to the north of Hokkaido anyway couldn’t belong to Japan. 
Indeed Japan historian Matsunaga T. wrote: “In 1643 Russians came to Kamchatka and  discoverTisim Islands and called them Kuril Islands”, and after Bering expedition “Russians occupied closest 21 island” so the all Kuril Islands, because the 22nd had name  Hokkaido.
Thus priority of Russia in discovering Kuril String from the second part of 17th century including its south part is historical fact. The central government of Japan announced the policy of strict isolation of Japan enclosing its territory with main islands of Japan Archipelago. It is important fact that the main part of Hokkaido Island was not included into the state till the middle of the 19th century, not to take account islands to the north.
More importantly the accessory of Kuril Islands to Russia as assign of Soviet Union include Hump, Kunashire and Little Kuril String based on a number of international right acts, which were accepted during and after World War the Second. Fundamental of them are Cairo Declaration 1943, Yalta Agreement 1945, Potsdam Declaration 1945, San-Francisco peacekeeping Treaty 1951, and Soviet-Japan modern Declaration 1956. When Japan joins the UN organized by winner states agreed with the documents just cited.
It is  noteworthy that the most important document among said is Potsdam Declaration, where noted strictly that Japan sovereignty would be limited by Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Sikoku Islands and other small islands which would be pointed  by the co-belligerent counties – without islands of Kuril String. Only on these conditions Japan capitulated and accepted them as the only possible. Thus in developing of this term on the 29th of January was signed memorandum №677 to Japan government by commander in-Chief of co-belligerent States general Douglas McArthur, where noticed that all of the Kuril Islands were excluded from Japan territory.",technology,1389956814
dogecoin,Dogecoin will be more profitable than bitcoin in the long run. Laugh now. Cry later.,"Now, of course by the title of this thread, you would think I was an avid supporter of dogecoin. You would be right. Even though I have a doge bias, if you're still unsure about dogecoins, I think it is worth your time to fancy this. Come, let's delve into the speculate world of speculation where speculators find satisfaction in speculating all day.

Ok, dogecoin daily transaction volume in the past two weeks has equated to over a million GREENBACKS twice. We are talking US dollars here. Those worthless little things that have value because that's what the law says. You gotta lay down the LAW! GREENBACKS! One of them for the loaf of bread. Exclude tax. Suckas!

We might as well even be stating that the daily transaction of dogecoin exceeded 1 million individually packaged loaves*(Shibe edit) of bread. It sounds better anyway.

There is no dogecoin to USD. If you happen to find someone that you trust and do some sort of wire transaction or paypal thing thats great, there are many trustworthy shibes around here. But some of us say we are Shibes and are not Shibes, but rather the Anti-Shibe. You need to be much aware. Very concern. Im a trustworthy Shibe, but I can tell you right now though, I am not coming off my dogecoins for the USD price they are at right now, that would be such not smart.

That million dollars that was traded twice in those 24 hour intervals was done all in btc or ltc, because cryptsy sets the standard right now for daily volume in doge and thats all they deal in. If dogecoin were available in USD, more people would rush to buy dogecoins. As it stands they are still such confuse about getting their hands on even a bitcoin. Now we have to tell them to convert that btc into doge. Its enough to make the masses head explode. They will catch on eventually. It already appears they are. However, USD to doge on exchange sites would dramatically increase the demand for doge which would get him to the moon a lot faster.

Right now doge wants to take off so bad. But, he is still a puppy. Very patience, Shiba Inu. Such reward. So future. Let me explain.

Dogecoins are being mined in crazy numbers right now because that is what the algorithm (correct me if Im wrong) was set to. We have already gotten an entire quarter of coins distributed about the internet right now. You would think this amount of creation would cause an incentive to sell because of the increased supply. You would be right.

However, the demand is so high, even still, despite the fact that there is no exchange site with USD to doge, that doge the miners are selling to create all that sell pressure is not enough to stop its increase. Right now it looks like we are holding very near .0000005 btc/doge

If doge could be traded into USD right now on exchange sites, sell wall would be smashed to pieces. At my university, everyone is talking about dogecoin, but no one knows how to get them. Thats the biggest question I get asked. All these people want to get their hands on doge. This is a lot more than a few million dollars here if you think about all the other major schools all across the country. These are millennials. Millennials are going to be buying into this like crazy because growing up all they experienced was financial ruin all around them which was a direct result of the Federal Reserve Banking system. They do not trust banks, but they do trust math geniuses, apparently (cough, satoshi. cough cough)

Dogecoin is literally blowing up right now and it could be much greater. It will be much greater. Doge so low right now. Such buy. Much reward. When all of the coins are mined and doge can be traded into USD on exchange sites, things will become very interesting. The formula will be set to lift-off on full blasters. Some greedy shibes may lose their shirts because of trying to buy and sell to the moon. But remember Shibes, this is a trip to space. We don't have time to stop and pee. You should have done that on one of the legs of the launch pad. If you try to stop and pee, you will burn yourself on the rocket boosters. WOW

I really dont know where dogecoin will be in a year. I can only speculate that value. Its going to be close to exiting Earth's atmosphere though you can take that to the bank.

Oh, and if you laughed when you read this post because you think doge wont moon, sit and stay, go ahead and cry a little bit now too so you dont have to deal with all the overwhelming amount of feels you are soon to experience. 

Such concern. How not such buy? Come wif to moon?
None of this is possible by ourselves. This community is so strong and such growth too. WOW almost 30k Shibes in just over a month.

Im going to end on this. You can keep your bitcoin. Ill take my 2.2 million dogecoins over that any day.
Edit: The reason I said 2.2 million is because thats what one btc equals right now. Im mining them. I don't have that much. I do have 100k from mining the past week and a half., though :)",cryptocurrency,1389957963

Bitcoin,Can we have some common sense here regarding Fed auction of SR Bitcoin?,"There is so much irrational fear and baseless speculation here. 

1) Seized assets are sold at government auctions open to the public. They will be announced well in advance of the auction. It won't be a 30 second warning then it hits the auction block. 

2) Regarding #1, The central bank, the CIA, a government official, wells fargo &lt;insert ominous entity here) aren't going to have some secret back room deal to buy the coins. That's just not how seized assets are liquidated and why in the hell would they wait for a seized asset auction to begin with. Just makes no sense at all. 

3) Seized assets often have reserves set at auction, reserves set by the federal agency responsible. 

4) Seized assets are often broken into smaller lots. Why? Faster selling at prices closes to market value. The auction portion is outsourced to auction companies who have incentive to ensure property is auctioned for the highest value possible because they get paid on some transaction fee % 

5) Regarding 3+4 above, the likelihood of all the bitcoins selling for far below fair market value is extremely low. The parties involved, do seized asset auctions for a living and know how to get the most for an item at auction. They will treat this as any other valuable item with a market and base their reserve prices and auction style decisions on that market.

6) This will effect the price regardless of who buys them and what they do with them afterward.(hold or dump) minimally and only in a very short term time frame. Yes even if they are immediately all dumped on open market. 

7) This liquidation of assets won't happen any time soon. The assets will be researched and the market value determined. This will drive the decision to split it into lots or keep it whole. Then They have to give public notice of the auction. This process could realistically(considering how slow the government is) take months into years!

**Turbo Tax Free Software Requirements:** 

* $30,000 or less Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

  * Your AGI is your 2013 gross income after you have subtracted allowable adjustments, such as moving expenses, IRAs, and alimony paid. You can find your AGI on line 37 of Form 1040 (or line 21 of the 1040A).

  * If you are filing using the Married Filing Jointly filing status, the $30,000 Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation applies to the AGI for both you and your spouse combined. This is the AGI that will appear on your return based on how you file.  

**H&amp;R Block Free Software Requirements:**  
 
* $58,000 or less adjusted gross income.  
* 52 or younger (as of December 31, 2013).  
* You may also qualify for FREE state filing from H&amp;R Block if you lived or claimed income in the following states: AR, AZ, DE, GA, IA, ID, IN, KY, MI, MN, MO, MS, ND, NC, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, VA, VT, WV, DC. 

[Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Frequently-Asked-Questions)  

&gt;* TurboTax was on there last year but I ended up using H&amp;R Block's software because it let me file free in my state while TurboTax wanted some money for my state filing. Once it's opened up you can see what each company offers in their free version and if you have to pay anything. 

&gt;* It begins this Friday (Jan 17th), but you don't have to fill it out immediately. If you do fill everything out early the companies will then hold your filing until Jan 31st which is when the IRS will begin accepting tax returns for 2013. 
  
&gt;* Keep in mind that most will force you to buy the ""better"" software if you're self-employed or even made any money via contracting. I saw a deal on Slickdeals on H&amp;R Block for free Federal and State filing but I don't qualify for the free version because I'm self-employed. I haven't looked through the others yet but I'm sure it will be more of the same.

&gt;* So if you are up for a challenge, you can actually use TurboTax online to help you out and then file for free using the Free Fillable Forms or whatever on the IRS website along with online filing of your state taxes from the state's site--assuming all states are like PA and offer free filing. You don't actually pay TurboTax until you file. Buried in the options is a preview of your 1040 form. Go through all the questions and you'll be able to see the final version of the 1040. As long as you can figure out the Schedules yourself and come up with the same numbers that are transferred over to the 1040, you are golden. Again, this requires a little bit of work because the Schedules can be challenging, but you'll learn something as a bonus! No filing fees with a bit of extra work.

**User Comments:**  

/u/just_for_da_lulz  : Protip: Look at reviews of the different programs before you decide!
I normally use TurboTax (which has been terrific) but I decided to use TaxSlayer last year for a reason I don't remember. It got the federal taxes fine but messed up my state taxes so two months later I ended up having to pay back about $400 which I really couldn't spare at the time. Turned out that something that qualified as a deduction on my federal taxes did not qualify for a state tax deduction under Minnesota law but TaxSlayer messed it up. Never had that issue with TurboTax and don't expect to this year, either.  

/u/Jazzy_Josh : Remember to check your state's Department of Revenue site to see if they have the same program for preparing and filling your state taxes

/utripshed :  Or if you make any amount, just do the webfile. It's free. Just verify the numbers in turbo tax but file for free!  

/u/hells_cowbells :  Also, be sure to check with your bank/credit union. I use a local bank, and lay year, they had a deal where i could use TurboTax through their banking site for free.  

/u/siphontheenigma : If you buy the cheap version of TurboTax (around $20) they will insure you against an audit and you can deduct the cost on next year's return. Although If your taxes are as simple as mine, you don't need audit protection (income - standard deduction - student loan interest).  

/u/auto_pry_bar :  The Turbotax free edition doesn't allow you to import information from your Brokerage account so if you re-invest dividends it becomes a huge hassle.  

/u/money_hard  : For Canadians check out [CRA website for programs](http://www.netfile.gc.ca/sftwr-eng.html). Usually they upload ~10 programs to use and at least a couple of them being freeware. (Becareful and check the dates for correct tax year before downloading!)",finance,1389973000

I have been trying to run the math on this but it is too complex for me to understand. I hope one of the more math savvy members of PF can help. Personally I think it will be very close and I may side with killing PMI as it is a sure thing (as well as the 3.75% return).",finance,1389978209

personalfinance,Owe a little federal tax.

Since I do not have an IRA open, i'd have to put up $1000 to do a Vanguard fund.

Bitcoin,Can someone explain what is the theorized steady state of bitcoin is?,"Right now Bitcoin is relatively new and there's a lot of speculation about what could happen to bitcoin. I'm guessing people who regular this subreddit and are invested in Bitcoin would speculate that Bitcoin and crypto currencies will eventually overtake fiat currencies due to decentralization. I'm not going to speculate one way or another. I simply have a question about the end-game or steady state of Bitcoins. 

Suppose bitcoins (or some other crypto-currency) becomes the defacto currency for most transactions (groceries, hair cuts, online goods, etc). Right now most fiat currencies are inflationary, with a small but noticeable inflation rate. This leads to holding currency become less valuable over time because more and more currency is printed. With a 2% inflation rate, it is unfavorable to hold currency if there is an investment you can make over 2% rate of return.

However, with Bitcoin there is no steady state inflation. With a fixed total cap, and supposedly more people constantly entering the market (due to population growth), and coins being lost for good, there will necessarily be some level of deflation for the currency. 

How do you see a deflationary currency being for an economy? I would argue that deflationary currency hurts poorer people, as poor people cannot hold currency. Poor people spend a majority of income on essential goods like food and shelter. Rich people right now spend a tiny fraction on these items, and must invest the rest to beat fiat currency inflation rates (or become poorer). 

Another major downside to deflationary currency is inability to get loans. Right now loans can carry high interest rates (4-18% depending on term and equity), but since this beats inflation banks still benefit from giving out loans. If currency is deflationary, what incentive do banks have to give out loans? They would have to charge massive interest rates to beat out deflation.

Also, right now currency inflation causes employers to be able to establish a fixed wage for employees. There's no risk for Mc. Donalds to fix a wage at $8/hr because that will only become cheaper with inflation. The only way deflationary currency could benefit the poor is if they held fixed wage jobs in that currency, but I seriously doubt any employer would agree to a long term fixed wage in a deflationary currency.

All of this seems to suggest that Bitcoin would only benefit the richest people, who can hold currency. In fact, in the worst case scenario this leads to a currency holding / deflation spiral. 

I'd appreciate good arguments and civil discourse about why this is right or wrong. Thanks.",cryptocurrency,1389983977

Options for consolidating private student loans have been sparse... WellsFargo offers it, but the rates aren't much better and my wife was denied a year ago (we had just refinanced mortgage).  Other banks had better rates, but required certain degrees (Law, Medical, etc) or that you went to a certain university - neither of which were applicable.  Citizens Bank got into the game a couple of days ago with an education refinance program with terms that look decent and comparable to some of the better programs we saw out there (that had requirements about degree, etc).  Here is the info about their program: http://www.citizensbank.com/student-loans/education-refinance-loan.aspx

My wife has $73k of high rate loans (~9%) currently set to a 25 year repayment with Sallie Mae, 21 years remaining to pay.  The best variable rate through Citizens are calculated as 1 Month LIBOR + 2.65% vs. their best fixed rate of 5.24%.  **If she were hypothetically approved at these rates, should she go with a fixed rate or the variable and why?**



Some additional info if it helps:  While we have high student loan debt, we have decent jobs and are paying between $1800-$2500 extra on student loans each month with a debt snowball approach.  So if we stayed put, we wouldn't intend to take the full 21 years to pay the high rate loans.  While we like the debt snowball approach, psychologically, it's hard to reconcile with the high interest rate loans - hence why we are looking to refinance so we can continue our plan without seeming like total idiots.  Goals are to reduce total interest paid, and to reduce monthly payments so we can continue to with the snowball plan (as most interest rates will be within same basic ballpark)",finance,1389994348

personalfinance,Senior Citizen parents are drowning in credit card debt,"My wife is the last surviving child of her parents.  Her parents come from a small Texas college town, and her father taught at the university for 25 years, and retired with a modest University pension and insurance.  He also ran an audio-video installation business on the side, which he ran full time after retiring from teaching.  He ran his business for roughly 20 years, always as a sole-proprietorship (no LLC, or real company structure).  His record-keeping was abysmal, and he had no real system of inventory management.  It took two full 16 hour days to clean out his workshop when moving.  Her mother is an uneducated woman who worked minimum wage jobs on and off (library, front desk work).  They are both in their 60s and have started to draw social security, though her mother's SS is less than 300$/mo.  

A year and a half ago we sold their small home, and they did a one-time-gift of a portion of the proceeds to go towards buying them a home around a mile from our house.  We bought the house, pay the mortgage, and do the upkeep on this home, while they live there and pay for the utilities.  We knew that her father had (in his words) ""some credit card debt"", which he accumulated while running his business, but we weren't told the physical dollar amount.  He intimated that the money left over from the sale of their home would be enough to handle his credit cards.   After moving he got a part time job working at a local retailer, and has also been picking up work with a neighbor that runs an A/V business.  We noticed that they always seemed very strapped for cash, and that he seemed to be working more and more hours recently.

Early last week my mother in law told my wife that they had been contacted by a telemarketer offering ""Debt Settlements"", and that this person would be coming over the next day to sign paperwork.  We immediately put that on hold and asked what was going on, asking that they at least let us read over the documentation that this company had provided to make sure that it was on the up and up. This company was promising to settle debt for 35c on the dollar, and as the old adage goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it is.  In reading over the paperwork we finally got a direct look at the debt, and found that they have $52,000 in credit card debt, spread across the total of six credit cards.  They are paying out $1300 every month just servicing credit card debt, plus another $800 in car payments.  Between the work he has been doing, social security, and pension, he has an income of a little less than $4000 monthly.  Her mother has no income, and doesn't work.  She does watch my kid 3 days a week, but we don't pay her to do it.

I researched the company, as well as the debt settlement business in general and quickly came to the decision that this isn't a good option for anyone.  They are fully current on all of their debts, but with $52,000 in balances the lowest a minimum payment could be on that amount is around $1000.  I don't yet know exactly what the interest rates are on the cards, but at a fairly good rate of 15% we are still talking somewhere around $650/mo in only interest.  The bottom line is that at their current debt level they can't possibly pay down the balances.  It is just a matter of time before he is no longer able to work as much as he currently is, or a new debt is accumulated (medical), which makes them unable to meet their obligations.

What recourse do they have?  Is bankruptcy it?  Surely ""debt settlement"" isn't a good idea.  My understanding is that those companies have you stop paying any of your debts in favor of paying them for a period of 4 years, after which point they attempt to negotiate a lump sum settlement with the creditor.  I have spent some time researching debt counseling options, and found a local non-profit debt counselor that I am going to have them talk with.  They aren't trying to avoid their debt, and would much rather pay off the debt than declare bankruptcy, but at the current balance and interest rate their monthly payment doesn't impact the balance.  Debt consolidation seems like the best option, but now that they don't have a home they don't have the assets to get a loan for that amount.  $52,000 is more than their home was worth, and had we known they had that kind of debt we never would have pressured them into moving in the first place.  

We want to help them, but the largest chunk of money that we could afford to give them right now without destroying our rainy day fund (around $15,000), I don't feel would reduce their burden enough to be worthwhile, not to mention that we have our own retirements and a child's college to save for.  We could pay it off completely, but we would have to reach into retirement funds to do it which would cost us hundreds of thousands in compound interest by the time we are retirement age.

Does it make sense to contact the credit card companies directly and attempt to negotiate a payment plan?  Does something like that need to go through a lawyer or a debt counseling company?  Is my best recourse to sell the house they are living in, pay off their debts, and move them in with me?  I just built a house with an extra bedroom and en-suite bathroom that is designed to accommodate someone with mobility issues, figuring that one or both of them would end up living with us within the next 20 years, I just didn't imagine that I would entertain that idea so soon.  

My wife and I both have very good jobs, we each make over $100k a year, and we just built a $360k house.  Before building that house we lived in a much smaller home that cost less than $150k and could have afforded to give them ~5k a month to pay off their debt quickly.  Now the max we could afford to give them monthly in assistance is ~2k.  But doing that would mean we couldn't contribute more than about 5% monthly to our own retirements.

Any and all advice would be appreciated.  Anyone that has dealt with a parent's debt would be especially helpful, as this is all very new and daunting for me.  Her mother is very emotionally fragile, and her father is a proud man, so the last thing I want to do is force them into doing anything they aren't comfortable doing, but their financial situation is simply not something that can be sustained.

TLDR;  Father racked up 50k$+ in credit cards running a business as a sole proprietor, now ""retired"" and on a never ending hamster wheel of minimum payments.  Almost got swindled by a debt settlement company, but now that we know the extent of the damage we need a solution.",finance,1390002657

personalfinance,Looking for some feedback on my plan of attack for paying down student loans.,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I just wanted to get some feedback about my plan of attack for paying down my student loans and future investing. I think I have a pretty solid plan for my goals, but I'd appreciate any suggestions for improvements that you all might have. 

My Current Loan balance is 29.5K @ 5.75% interest 


*Here's my current plan for repayment* - 

**Student Loans** Goal - Pay off Loans by end of 2020

* I started by enrolling for automatic withdrawals, to reduce my interest rate from 6% to 5.75%. 
* I am currently paying approximately 2x the minimum payment. On a monthly basis, I am also planning on taking any extra money above my ""emergency fund"" balance to add to the next payment. 
* If/when I get any future increases in income, I'll increase my automatic recurring payment per the correlating wage increase.

Basically, my thought here is that I'm basically guaranteed a rate of return on my money now by paying off the loans early. If I am able to pay my loans off early, I will be able to accelerate my future savings (see below).


**Savings/Investing**

* On a monthly basis, I am planning on setting aside a small amount ~($75-100) into a separate savings account for a trip abroad that I might be taking in a few years. 
* Currently, my employer offers a 4% match for my 401k. I am currently only contributing 4% to get the full company match. Once my student loans are paid off, I plan on re-allocating my previous loan payments towards my 401k (upto the $17.5k max - pending future salary - etc). 
* If I have anything extra funds available afterwards, I am going to look into opening an IRA account and contributing upto $5500 each year (again - pending future circumstances). 

That's pretty much it. Do you guys/gals have any suggestions for improvement? I've been thinking of increasing my 401k contributions in the short term (so I can max out my company match earlier in the year - therefore giving the full amount more time for interest to be earned).

personalfinance,Refinancing Considerations,"I've been considering refinancing my home to lower the interest rate and to ultimately make it more profitable if I choose to purchase another home within the next year and begin renting out the current town home.

I've built myself a spreadsheet to monitor the costs of my mortgage and to see how I've reduced the amount of interest the bank will earn off of me.  Ideally, I'd buy another house this next year and rent out this one to generate passive income mostly in the form of equity in the town home.  The town home is located in an area that would be very easy to rent out and I believe the price range will typically exclude those that would do lots of damage etc and would be more of a pain to manage.  I have also rented it out while I was deployed and the experience was great.

I'm surprised to find out in my research that refinancing won't likely save me money in the long run, but can reduce my payment now but increase the length of time I'm paying for.  I know everyone's situation is different, however I'm wondering if I'm viewing this the wrong way so any other considerations you guys have as a recommendation I'd appreciate.  

Current Loan was $162,000 @ 4.75% interest Rate, FHA 30 year loan with minimum down payment.  I'm about 3 years in and have always added additional principal to reduce the amount of interest on the backend of the loan.  I've put about an extra $12,000 in over the past three years which has effectively translated into roughly $20,000 savings on the backend, and more if I continue to contribute at the high rate which I have done.

finance,Derivatives Still A Big Cause For Concern?,"Paul Singer Warns Of Derivatives Catastrophe](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/01/paul-singer-davos-speech/)

“The major financial institutions (those bailed out or implicitly supported in the last crisis) have taken important steps to reduce their trading risks since the 2008 collapse.  However, it is impossible to verify such progress from public financial statements or even to assess these institutions’ true financial risks. Unfortunately, opacity and extreme leverage still reign supreme.”

While transparency into the unknown depth and nature of the derivatives risk is critical, it is leverage usage to which Paul Singer has historically been most concerned and that he addresses most forcefully.  The hedge fund executive is known to be loathsome of excessive leverage usage to juice returns and has generally shunned the practice in his professional life.

“There is a system, developed over decades, consisting of both industry practice and federal regulation, to ensure that secured ‘margin’ loans to the trading customers of financial institutions cannot become unsecured by the adverse movement of security prices. Customers must put up initial margin when entering a trade and have to post more if the equity in their account declines by a certain amount. A cushion is thus maintained, which protects the financial institutions and the system,” the prepared remarks say. 

Regulated derivatives usage follows strict guidelines for leverage and margin usage as well as requirements for complete transparency. Current estimates of the leverage usage in unregulated OTC derivatives that underlie the economies of the western world range from $600 to $700 trillion in notional value, far eclipsing the liquidating value of the banks that generally back these derivatives.  The exact extent of the obligation is unknown due to the lack of transparency, but to provide perspective to the scope of leverage being used, the world economy is valued at $72 trillion. If these derivatives were to implode, as they did in 2008, it would literally wipe out the world economy several times over. Derivatives are like insurance contracts.  The large banks have underwritten this insurance, most of which is tied to interest rates.  If interest rates were to rise rapidly, which is possible given the government debt situation, it could trigger many of these derivatives and create a domino effect type economic crash. Paul Singer is not addressing an outlier event, but rather a situation that many inside the derivatives industry consider a probability.


 
“These systems, of how customers finance securities positions, and how banks are financed and operate, enabled the world’s financial system to work without systemic collapse for more than 70 years after the Great Depression of the 1930s gave policymakers a solid to-do list of fixes which were necessary in order to avoid a repeat,” Paul Singer’s prepared remarks say. “Over the last 20 years or so, however, many of the world’s financial institutions built astronomically massive books of derivatives, private equity, other illiquid assets and extensive proprietary trading positions which have dwarfed their traditional banking books and fee-for-services activities.”",finance,1390092952
investing,Derivatives Still A Big Cause For Concern?,"[Paul Singer Warns Of Derivatives Catastrophe](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/01/paul-singer-davos-speech/)
“The major financial institutions (those bailed out or implicitly supported in the last crisis) have taken important steps to reduce their trading risks since the 2008 collapse. However, it is impossible to verify such progress from public financial statements or even to assess these institutions’ true financial risks. Unfortunately, opacity and extreme leverage still reign supreme.”
While transparency into the unknown depth and nature of the derivatives risk is critical, it is leverage usage to which Paul Singer has historically been most concerned and that he addresses most forcefully. The hedge fund executive is known to be loathsome of excessive leverage usage to juice returns and has generally shunned the practice in his professional life.
“There is a system, developed over decades, consisting of both industry practice and federal regulation, to ensure that secured ‘margin’ loans to the trading customers of financial institutions cannot become unsecured by the adverse movement of security prices. Customers must put up initial margin when entering a trade and have to post more if the equity in their account declines by a certain amount. A cushion is thus maintained, which protects the financial institutions and the system,” the prepared remarks say.
Regulated derivatives usage follows strict guidelines for leverage and margin usage as well as requirements for complete transparency. Current estimates of the leverage usage in unregulated OTC derivatives that underlie the economies of the western world range from $600 to $700 trillion in notional value, far eclipsing the liquidating value of the banks that generally back these derivatives. The exact extent of the obligation is unknown due to the lack of transparency, but to provide perspective to the scope of leverage being used, the world economy is valued at $72 trillion. If these derivatives were to implode, as they did in 2008, it would literally wipe out the world economy several times over. Derivatives are like insurance contracts. The large banks have underwritten this insurance, most of which is tied to interest rates. If interest rates were to rise rapidly, which is possible given the government debt situation, it could trigger many of these derivatives and create a domino effect type economic crash. Paul Singer is not addressing an outlier event, but rather a situation that many inside the derivatives industry consider a probability.

personalfinance,"Hello everyone, can you help me here?","First, thank you for using your time to help me out here. This is a long read and I'll keep it short as possible.


I'm a 25 year old male and in need of financial advice. This is all the information I gathered on my situation and I'll be as accurate as possible. My profession is a full time waiter. I'm in recovery at the moment and not working because I had surgery on Monday and hopefully return on Friday. I live with my 2 younger brothers and my Mom. We all pay a portion of something but I don't pay rent. Just utilities, cable/internet, and personal expenses.


Here are the numbers on all my dept gathered from the credit karma app. Everything is rounded up. This does not include monthly living expenses.


Total dept: $29,570


Auto loan: $17,765 


Student loans: $4,765


Credit: $3,941 - I personally have just one through Capital One ($500 limit, currently at $519) I'm an authorized user on my Mom's Lowe's credit card as well as my younger brother. ($3,400 limit, currently at $3,422.) I don't pay anything on this nor use it. She always likes to touch up the place so she give's me a list of what to buy and I go myself instead of waiting.


Other: $700 dollars. I had a credit card through navy federal. I closed it and just paying it off.


Medical: $3,000 (I have no idea at the moment how much everything is. Can't find the paper work because I was out of it for a few days and resting. This is just a guess)


My monthly income ranges from $1,600 - $2,000. I work for tips so its not always the same. We'll stick with $1,600 and break my dept into monthly payments plus my monthly expenses.


Monthly Living:


Car - $370 (Total - $17,765)


Car Insurance - $130 (Geico)

Other - $20 (Total - $700)


Credit Card - $25 (Total - $519, Capital One)


Gas - $125 (I'm guessing)


Medicine - $30


Therapist/psychiatrist - $30 - $15 a session (Going to go twice a month. Seeing a new one soon that's closer and I'm basing the price off my last therapist. I go for depression and anxiety. Telling everyone because it may play a factor.)


Surgery and other hospital visits - $300 ( (I can't seem to find the paperwork to the total cost of all my medical bills. This is just my gut feeling guess and just throwing a number out


Student loans - $66 (Total is $4,764)


Cell phone - $55 (AT&amp;T, I'm on a family plan and that's my portion. The  other providers near my area are Sprint, Verizon, maybe T-Mobile, and Intelos. These are off the top of my head.)


Utilities - $100, my portion (I try my best to keep it as low as possible. Everyone isn't as mindful to turn everything off and what not. I got energy efficient bulbs and that's all I can think of. Any tips people can offer?)


Gym - $35

Total - $1,286


Now, this is my budget if I make $1,600 that month and if I don't go out to eat or spend money at any bars, movies, and other places. It will be a lot of will power and I'll spend my extra free time at the gym, studying for placement test to get back into school, and learning a new skill. I was thinking, later, that I sign up for the car mechanics class  at the community college here. I haven't brain stormed that idea enough yet and just going to work on balancing this mess at the moment.


My current plan that's still in the works:


-Take account for every bit of money going in and going out. Keep track of it 24/7 and be as frugal as possible.


-Make all meals at home.


-No drinking or toking. Clean living and going to the gym. Hit 2 birds with one stone.


-I got a membership to Sam's Club for bulk buying.


-Pay off my Capital One and closed navy federal card first. Place any extra income into those first. Should I use any remaining balance to pay off the closed card with my Capital One. Say I have $300 left on my closed card and I have $300 available on my Capital One, use it to finish it off and then take that extra 20 a month and bump my Capital One payment from $25 to $45 a month?


-Next would be to eliminate my medical bill. Place extra income towards the balance. Or divide the extra income towards student loans and my medical bill.


-Look into how to keep better track of energy usage in the house. It's been a but more expensive due to the sub zero cold fronts. Advice on where to get started?


-Look around for a better cell phone plan. 


-Increase my credit score. The one Credit Karma provided was 601. 


That's all I have at the moment. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 


P.S. - For anyone wondering how it got this way, I wasn't very lucky growing up and one family member after another getting sick didn't help much either. So I was working 2 jobs everyday after school from 2:30pm - 12am from 15-19. I'm really working on turning things around and I'm brand new to learning how to manage money. I'm trying to make a big move with my brothers sooner than later. In the process I'm going to look for a more stable job. That's why I thought mechanic. A few buddies of mine work at a few shops and get paid $16 an hour and almost never work weekends unless they want to. When I land that I'll get back into school and I'll plan it from there.",finance,1390098656
dogecoin,How and why I chose to focus on DOGE - A Reasoned Account (kinda long),"The last few days are interesting. Price is changing rapidly, and (for now?) holding steady. That’s cool. Like the Wolves and Weasels guy writes, that’s due in no small part to the work we have all been doing inside Reddit, and especially outside as we teach others about cryptocurrency, and the great community that exists. 



I wanted to type quickly about my path to the Doge – I was interested in cryptos (BitCoin) after researching the darknet, learning about Tor, and seeing the Silk Road before it died. The political aspect of cryptos was lost on me, as was the potential disruptive impact of such a technology. That was October 2012. I thought I might mine some BTC, saw it wasn’t “worth it” based on my specs (BTC = ~$11 IIRC) and ignored it until the same time in 2013 when I kept seeing tech news about BTC and hearing stupid media reports of $$$ (they never focus on the important stuff). Being a dreamer, a gambler, and a tech enthusiast (different from a gadget nerd, BTW) I got an investment plan together and, believing in diversification and doing some research, thought BTC, LTC and… FTC? I dropped the FTC and went BTC and LTC. Then I looked into mining altcoins. It was almost Christmas, I had some time, so I started lurking…reading…researching. I got more excited about the concept of cryptos, but wanted something that had the promise of BTC (disruption, adoption, utility) but wasn’t just a clone (didn’t seem viable beyond dump for BTC).


 
Dogecoin had just been born. I saw the immediate community jump up and support the coin. Cheering the price, tipping like mad, sharing the knowledge. In my experience researching cryptos and asking questions, (often in the noob areas!), I have found an inordinate number of Bitcoiners acting like holier than thou jerks (think Comic Book Guy on the Simpsons). The Litecoin subreddit tends to be pretty slow and very “little brother” to Bitcoin. I don’t sense a revolutionary spirit there (Bitcoin has that, sometimes). Dogecoin subreddit is off the hook. So many nice people sharing, laughing, and not being too serious. 



I thought about the future of cryptos, and it came to me – Dogecoin is the crypto of youth, of fun, of community. It is the crypto that will probably do what I assume FedoraCoin wanted to do (tips!) better than the others. It started as a joke, but got serious in the right ways and it got what the other cryptos don’t have – amazing support and sharing. Example: During the fork there was confusion, and then rather quickly, resolve. People got ripped off at Xmas, and the community responded. Somebody tipped the Pope. It’s on fire folks, and for a good reason – support.



It all made sense – Doge was the altcoin to focus time and energy on. I built a mining rig for fun, brushed up my linux skills, and started the big dig. I bought a few DOGE while they were cheap. IT JUST MADE SENSE. I don’t know where this is headed, or for how long, but let’s keep our heads and keep it fun while being smart. There’s nothing wrong with both at the same time! This is the kind of stuff you can tell your friends in 10 years when they use cryptos like we use texting today – I was there – not when it started started, but in that second stage when things got interesting and cryptos took on personalities. I was part of the fun crew. 



Keep it real. Be smart. Share and be kind. Help. Ask. Play.



Best to all.",cryptocurrency,1390107665
personalfinance,Unemployment extension help?,"I don't know where to post this as /r/unemployment is empty, but here's my question:

I did full time at a job in california for about 2 - 2 1/2 months only (May 2012-July 2012) making about 1500$ or so but I'm not sure if I can file an extension. I heard about the federal unemployment stuff getting yanked out and my last benefit payment was on the 4th and it only gave me $5. I went to the EDD website and applied online again (about 9-10 business days ago) but under as extension, but I haven't gotten an email yet.

I should also add....that I'm currently not in the states, that I'm in Europe. I'm getting my mail sent to my parents house (the same state I worked and lived in) but I hate asking them to see what I got especially since they kicked me out 2 years ago and are really only doing this as a favor.

personalfinance,A strange time to enter the market,"Hi PF, 

I would love this to evolve into a general discussion, but as this is *personal* finance, let me give you my context quickly: 


I'm 31, earn around $140k/year net working for an international institution, no debts and recently bought a flat in a major European city worth around $300k (paid cash, no mortage). I am supporting a child and paying for a dear friend's university education, but even so I save at least 65% of income (used to be more). I'm paid in Dollars, and because I think the Euro will probably depreciate the next year(s), I want to keep most of the money in Dollars for now. I have around $80k in a employer-retirement account, which I can't touch until I quit this job, at which point it will be paid out as a lumpsum. I work hard and in faraway places, and so never really had the time to set up and think through an investment account, so the money has kept accumulating in cash on a no-interest current. I'm sitting on around $150,000 now (in addition to the employer retirement account), so I finally opened an investment account. I have a risk-averse, long-term outlook. I currently don't have to pay capital gains tax.


Now: It seems to me it is a strange time to enter the market. Stocks are at all-time highs, so while one cannot time the markets, intuitively it seems that my returns to a generic stock investment would probably be undermined by an upcoming correction.  I could go bonds, which I feel naturally attracted to as a risk-averse person, but with this whole Fed tapering business, interest rates will probably improve soon and I might get stuck in 2-3% bonds, when suddenly risk-free 4-5% are possible again. 
 

Of course, for me anything will be an improvement given that the 150k are sitting on a zero interest account at the moment. Even so, I'm scratching my head a bit. I thought perhaps I should start with investing 50k only and leaving 100k in cash for a few more months to wait and see. Those 50k, maybe I put 10k into gold/gold ETF at current lower prices, put 30k into relatively safe individual 2-3% interest bonds that expire no later than 2016 (then I could re-invest at higher rates), and do long-term stock-picking with the remaining 10k (e.g. I thought maybe some German/Japanese robotics companies), and then see how it goes. 


However, I guess stock-picking is always a bad idea for a newbie, so perhaps better put the 10k into a generic stock-fund, and instead of individual bonds, maybe I should buy into a bond-fund instead as well? But I'm new to funds and don't know where to source reliable information about them or get some comparisons. Finding and reading up about individual companies seems easier. 


Markets just seem to be in a bit of a twilight zone at the moment, and I wonder what would be the best move to enter.

**EDIT:Thanks everyone for the many comments. The point is well taken that it makes no sense to try and time the market, esp. if I have a long term horizon. In any case, being all interest free cash is certainly crazy, so I need to make a move no matter, and not waste time regretting opportunities past. I think for psychological reasons I will take the advice to cost-average in over the next 3-6 months. I will start with large non-tech US companies that pay good dividends and have a stable product (McDonalds was suggsted; and maybe I'll add one or two pharmaceuticals like Novartis and LLY); also, I will try to find bonds for around ~3% that expire in 2015/16 so that I can re-invest then if yields really do go up. Also, I'll dump a bit into a mutual fund... some semi-conservative Vanguard maybe. I guess I won't become a overnight millionaire that way, but at least I won't be a total idiot anymore giving free money to banks. Thanks again.**",finance,1390134093

personalfinance,Paying off debt and need some help.,"Hi PF! You guys have been awesome help so far and I'm hoping you can help shed some light on my next planning step. 

My husband and I working to get a lot of our debt paid down. Here's what we have so far:

$3400 on a credit card with a 14.6% interest rate
$11,000 borrowed from parents with no interest being paid. 
$2,400 on a credit card with 0% interest until October which then jumps to 26%
$4,905 on a student loan with 4.573% mixed interest 
$48,000 student loan with 6.8% interest currently under IBR. 
2 years left on a car payment at $345 a month (3.9% interest). 

So far the plan is to pay off the two credit cards, then the borrowed money, then the smaller student loan, then the car. We are paying between 2,000 and 3,000 a month to these. 

My main question is regarding the larger student loan. It has been under IBR for four years now and with our income I don't see us moving out of IBR any time soon. After the rest of our debt is paid off, should we snowball the money into that loan or just wait off the 25 years until it's forgiven? 

I have my 401k maxed at the 6% my employer will match. 
I have about 15k in stock options through work as well. 
My husband has no retirement savings yet (he is 31). 

We have very little savings. We are putting around $150 a month into savings at this point.

I am a 23 year old University student in my last semester of my BA English with a minor in Biology. My goal (and long term dream) was to be an English/Biology teacher at the high school level. The program my school offers requires a teachable major and a teachable minor, hence the weird mix.

In the past semester, I've had some shitty circumstances arise in my life (breakup, parental problem, etc), and am now looking at taking a year off school in order to regroup. My motivation for school is at an all time low, and the Education program I would be heading into would be the hardest time I've had yet at school and I don't think I presently have the fortitude to keep my head above water so I decided the smartest thing to do would be to take a year off. 

On to the problem: I have $38,000CAD in federal student loans waiting for me when I'm not in school. The current monthly payment is about 300~ a month. I have a car payment of $200.00/month (financed it a few years ago out of necessity during my summer job, its a 2011 Chevy Cruze very reliable).

My quandary comes from being in a weird spot during this time off- I will have a degree but one that I never intended to get a job from (I know English major prospects are hilarious at best). I will only really be eligible for employment for a year, so that restricts even further.

I graduated with an MA in Elementary Education back in August 2013 and am teaching, making about 40K a year.

With that in mind, my primary thought is, ""Wouldn't I be better served by choosing an extended repayment option?"" I would definitely pay more over the course of loan repayment, but my loan repayments would become less than what they are projected to be now, thereby allowing me to allocate more money more quickly into my 403(b) and emergency fund.

personalfinance,Managing Finances as a Couple (CA),"This is a post from my and my girlfriend's blog, about how we manage day-to-day finances and shared expenses as a couple.  It is mostly applicable to Canadians (we reference specific Canadian banks and credit cards) but the general system should still be applicable to most people.

The blog is called ""Incoming Assets"" on Wordpress, though I can't link to it due to subreddit rules.  It doesn't show up on a search engine since it is small, so if you want the link just PM me. 

***

Something we get asked about regularly is how we manage our day-to-day finances as a couple.  Over the years, our system has been refined greatly to be as efficient and convenient as possible.   Our setup is mostly relevant to couples who live together, share expenses, but do not want to have joint bank accounts for whatever reason.  However, even single people should still read this – particularly Canadians – as many of the details and tips could be applicable.

The most important, and defining, characteristic of our banking setup is that we pay zero dollars in fees.  We refuse to pay money to a bank for the privilege of holding our money – they should be paying us.  (Our investment accounts do have very small fees on the funds, but we have no account fees, maintenance fees, or service charges of any kind).

We each have two chequing accounts – President’s Choice Financial, and ING Direct (soon to be rebranded as  Tangerine).  Both these banks offer unlimited transactions, zero fees, decent interest rates, and good customer service.  President’s Choice offers free chequebooks, while ING does not.  However, ING Direct offers free online money transfers (which go through instantly if sent between two ING clients), whereas PC does not.  We pay our rent through cheques from PC, and transfer money between ourselves through ING when needed.

If you are Canadian and not already an ING customer, consider signing up.  Using a referral key will get you a signup bonus in cash (and a bonus for the referrer as well).

The second important element in our banking system is credit cards.  We try to put every expense possible on a credit card.  Partly because we get free cash back, but more importantly because it is the easiest way to keep track of joint expenses.  Our credit card purchases automatically post on Mint.com; we then do full payouts on all credit cards twice a month.

We have a total of four joint credit cards, each fulfilling a unique function:

1. Amazon.ca Visa – 1% cash back on all purchases, 2% on Amazon.ca purchases, and most importantly, no service charge or foreign currency exchange fee when used outside Canada.  This is the only card we use when we are travelling.

2. Costco American Express – 1% cash back on all purchases, 3% on restaurants, and 2% on gas.  We have this since it is the only credit card accepted at Costco.

3. President’s Choice Financial Mastercard: 1% cash back on all purchases (in the form of PC Points, which can be spent at Superstore, No Frills, etc.), as well as additional rewards through the PC Plus program.  We use this as our generic, all-purpose credit card.

4. MBNA SmartCash Mastercard: 1% cash back on all purchases, 2% on groceries.  This is our most recent card, and we got this mainly because they offered us a $100 gift card as a signup bonus.  We use this for most grocery purchases.

We split all our shared expenses (groceries, internet bill, etc.) 50/50.  Individual bills like our own cell phones, clothes, are paid for individually.

Our system may seem quite complicated when described, but it is incredibly simple in practice, an efficient way to maximize credit card rewards, and keep costs down by not paying service fees.

Here is a runthrough of a typical month:

January 1st through 15th: We buy groceries and whatever else we normally buy, putting all of it on the relevant credit card.

January 15th, end of day: We log into Mint and tally up all our credit card purchases, which are automatically tracked.  Any individual expenses, we add up separately and pay those off.  All joint expenses, we add up and then split in half, and we each pay off that half.

Cel also does an online transfer of money through ING Direct to Steph, to pay for his half of February’s rent.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on navigating my long-term savings goals.,"So, my New Year Resolution this year was to be more frugal and to manage my own money better. The frugality part is going well, but the personal finance part involves a lot more navigating - finance involves a lot more long-term change in behavior than things like turning off the lights when you leave the room, shopping with coupons, buying in bulk, hang-drying your laundry, etc.

I've narrowed down my long-term goals to the following:

1. Build up an emergency fund

2. Start investing for retirement

3. Make a dent in my student loans

Every financial planner I know of and everything I've read says to build the emergency fund first, so right now that's the priority - it also takes less work than the other two. I started using YNAB for budgeting last year, so I already had about $750 saved for various rainy day fund line-items.

Where I'm looking for advice comes from the other two. The rub here, to me, is that time value of money works both ways. Part of me thinks ""Pay off the debt, then take the amount you put toward debt payment every month and invest that, you'll avoid paying interest,"" but the other part says ""Start investing now, you'll get more compound interest toward retirement."" I'm just not sure which to prioritize - I know the textbook answer would be ""If the interest rate for your investments is higher, invest and make the minimum payments on your loans, if the interest rates on your loans are higher, maximize payments to those and invest when they've been paid,"" but I feel like that's a little too theoretical and clear-cut. I also feel like taking a scatter-shot approach of investing some and paying off some extra debt is probably not maximizing the value of my money, but I'm not great at math, so if I'm wrong there feel free to correct me.

Some more specific details and mitigating factors:

1. Both myself and my wife have student loan debt. We only got loans to pay for tuition and paid everything else out of pocket, so it's not a lot - certainly not six-figures like I've seen in some other places - but as far as comparable consumer goods, we've got enough debt between us that we could have financed a current-year car with it.

2. My parents are generously helping me with the student loan debt - basically throwing an extra $100 or so per month toward the debt to help pay it down faster. I'm very grateful for this!

3. I'm 24 years old, so the temptation is there to say ""I can focus on the debt now, and even if it takes 10 years to pay the debt I'll still only be 34 when I start investing. That'll give me 34 years to retirement,"" but again, I know that time value of money could be netting me more.",finance,1390177771
personalfinance,Looking for some guidance regarding Income-Based Repayment plan (student loans),"Hi all!  Here is my student loan situation:


Me:  

$153k in federal loans (most at 6.8%; 30k at 5% and 33k at 3.5%)  
$124k taxable income (2013)  
$110k taxable income (projected 2014)  


Wife:  
$25k in federal loans (~6%)  
$45k taxable income (2013)  
$38k taxable income (projected 2014)  
   
  
I recently took a job with the federal government (hence the lower projected 2014 income) and my wife is working less hours as we prepare for our first child due in June.  Our incomes will probably stay roughly the same over the foreseeable future (maybe 1-2% increase per year but no guarantee).  I am currently using the extended repayment plan but would like to try to switch to income-based and get the balance forgiven after 10 years.   



My questions are:   


* Do they use current income, or year-prior tax return to determine the monthly payment?  Would it make more sense to wait until next year to switch to use our 2014 return (with lower incomes and a child to claim)?

* Will it be to our benefit to file separately from now on?

* Anyone have experience with a situation like this?

dogecoin,Dogecoin Mining PC Specifications and First 24 Hours of Performance,"If this is TL;DR, these are specs on building a fairly nice ~1.3-1.5 MH/s Dogecoin mining PC running Linux, for around $2000.

Some fellow doges have asked about the Dogecoin mining PC that I recently built.  This post covers the hardware and software used, as well as the performance I've got over the last 24 hours.

First of all, there are some negative properties of my configuration:

* it was not intended to be the cheapest for the given level of performance; I will use it for other things, and did not want to build it in a milk crate or some other ghetto configuration
* it is extremely loud; other GPUs may be less noisy ... it is loud enough that you would not want it in a small space like an apartment or near a living area that you plan to spend time in (you would probably lose hearing)
* it was built using GPUs that were available in-stock; not the ones that are most economical for mining or highest performing at the moment

That said ... here are the specifications.

Hardware:

* Case - CoolerMaster Storm Stryker ($158.86) : This is an expensive case, but it is rather beautiful, and seems to have good airflow.  Also, keep in mind that cases pretty much last forever, so money spent here is not wasted, as the case can be used for future PCs for many years.  If you plan on using a computer for more than just mining, you want a good case, not some milk crate monstrosity.
* Motherboard - MSI Z87 MPOWER LGA 1150 ($204.99) : I thought the motherboard would be a key component in order to properly run 2 GPUs for 24x7.  This one looked to be of high quality, and the spacing between the PCIe-x16 slots looked better than on some other options.  MSI claims that it's good for dual GPU gaming in their marketing.
* CPU - Intel Core i7-4771 3.5 GHz ($318.99) : This was massive overkill, but I wanted to use the computer for other things, and it didn't make sense to me to save $50 or so by buying a cheaper one
* RAM - 8GB Crucial Ballistix ($89.99) : I didn't think I would need much RAM, and this seemed sufficient
* Power Supply - XFX 1000W 80PLUS Platinum ATX Full Modular ($209.99) : I selected a 1000W power supply in order to sufficiently run the GPUs and rest of the system.  The pcpartpicker website can be helpful in checking this.  I selected an 80PLUS Platinum one because it will be running nearly constantly, so efficiency and quality of the unit seemed important.  In the past, I've always skimped and bought cheap power supplies, and paid the price when they fail and blow up the motherboard and other components.  I didn't want that to happen here.
* GPUs - Two GIGABYTE GV-R929D5-4GD-B Radeon R9 290 4GB cards ($499.99 each; note these have now risen about $20 each in the last week according to Internet prices I see) : I selected these, because I saw several benchmarks indicating they would each be capable of generating about 800 kH/s, and the few higher performing models were not available to ship immediately, or were extremely higher priced.  I did not want to wait.
* Cooling - CoolerMaster Seidon 240M CPU Liquid Cooling System ($109.99) : This may be overkill since the GPU mining that Dogecoin uses does not stress the CPU, however, I went with it for 3 reasons: (1) I planned to do other things on the machine (and it can CPU mine for maybe another 100 kH/s), (2) I didn't want CPU heat and airflow interfering with the GPU fans and airflow, and (3) it's just plain cool.
* Hard Disk (free) : I used some old hard disk scavenged from a dead laptop; it is nothing special
* Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor : don't matter; I just reused existing ones

After collecting all the parts, there was little/no difficulty putting things together.  The few catches were due to me not having built a PC in over 10 years.  Some notes, which will be obvious to more experienced doges:

* The Storm Stryker case has an odd, unlabelled connector inside that puzzled me for a long time; this apparently is for extra LEDs inside the case, in case you want to add them, or something.  LEDs do not help generate DOGE, and I didn't have them.
* The large fan in the top of the Storm Stryker has to be removed to fit the radiator for the liquid CPU cooler; this is very easy, but I realized that it may reduce the airflow I was looking for.  The smaller fans on the radiator may be powered from connectors for either ""CPU"" or ""SYSTEM"" fans, and subject to different voltage controls, so how you connect them may make a difference.
* MSI poorly does not include a parts manifest in the MPOWER motherboard box, and their manual does not mention that the WiFi / Bluetooth module is separate.  They happened to not include it in my box, only a baggie with a screw for it, and it has to be installed prior to mounting the motherboard in the case.  This seems to really be an afterthought for them.  They should mention it in their manual, since it needs to be installed near the beginning of a build, and they should include a parts manifest.  They refuse to ship me the module that they neglected to include, after talking to their customer support, suggesting that I ship the whole thing back to NewEgg (yeah right).

When it was all put together, I had some issues with Fedora 20 trying to get the AMD proprietary drivers to work.  These are needed for mining, because they provide the OpenCL interface that cgminer uses.  The Fedora 20 kernel is ""too new"" and part of the API changed, which means you have to modify one line of source code by hand and not use the normal install directions.  After doing this, several other pieces of the system were very unhappy, and I decided to use an older Linux flavor.

Using Xubuntu 12.04.3, I had no problems at all, when using the version 13.11 ""beta"" driver provided by AMD on their website.  Their installer for it worked well.  The only catch was that after rebooting, it was only recognizing one of my GPUs.  I had to run ""aticonfig --adapter=all"" and restart in order to correct this, and all was well.

Setting up cgminer was fun; you have to use version 3.7.2 (not the most recent), as GPU support was removed from later versions.  I experimented with several settings.  My goal has been to keep the GPUs under 80 deg C.  To do this, I ended up having to set a target temperature of 75 deg C.  In this configuration, I'm getting a total from the two between 1.3 and 1.5 MH/s over the last 24 hours.  The one closest to the CPU is getting a couple degrees hotter than the other, I believe because its airflow is more blocked / restricted.

If people are interested, I will post more data from trying different cgminer parameters (intensity, etc.), as I found some of the ones suggested on other websites are either bogus or somehow didn't work for me.

Hope this was helpful information and DOGE makes it to the moon!",cryptocurrency,1390181008
financialindependence,"PSA from a health actuary, don't underestimate future health expenses","I'm an actuary who works for a large health insurer in the US and I've worked on pricing insurance plans and the industry transition due to the Affordable Care Act. My comments will mostly be directed at US citizens, and of course at those interested in Financial Independence and/or Early Retirement. 

What prompted me to post this is that I frequently see budgets (posted here and elsewhere) with medical expenses that are too low, lumped in with all other expenses and indexed to something silly like a 3% inflation rate. Your expenses may be much higher than you might expect for a few key reasons:

1. Your employer most likely subsidies your health insurance so you may not know the true cost. Most employers cover at least 50 to 75% of the employer-sponsored health plans.
2. Individual plans according to ACA are age rated on a 3-to-1 ratio so that 64-year-olds will pay at most 3 times that of 21-year-olds. The true expected cost ratio is much higher, this rule basically has the younger healthier insured subsidizing the older. This also means that as you age your insurance  and expected costs will increase even without medical cost inflation. Under ACA it's about 2.8% per year, but the true expected increase is more like 3.5%. 
3. Healthcare inflation in the US has been much higher than inflation historically, roughly twice that of the consumer price index. If you take the 3% due to aging and 6% healthcare inflation, the CPI adjusted costs would still increase 6% annually. Trend this out 25 years and you see the problem. 

I will get into subsidies in a bit, but so far I've only mentioned the insurance costs. Each plan has different costs sharing systems which defines what the insurance company pays and how much you pay. However, you can look at something called the Actuarial Value (AV) which explains that for all enrollees how much the insurance company pays on average versus the enrollee. A Bronze plan with a 60% AV will pay on average 60% of the health expenses of an enrollee. Thus, if a bronze plan is $3,000 a year with an AV of 60%, then the average enrollee contribution is (0.4 x 3,000/0.6) = 2,000. It's a huge over-simplification, but this is for demonstrative purposes. 

You may think “60%? That's hardly insurance!"" This is on average. If you have a $3,250 deductible with 100% coinsurance and spend $2,500, then they'll pay nothing. If you are hospitalized and end up with a $100,000 bill, the insurance company ends up paying 97%. My point is more that you can use the AV and premium to very roughly see what they expect you to cost and how much out-of-pocket you'll spend (This is on top of the monthly premium). You can make your own personal adjustments due to being healthy and active, but people age. I've not had to pay for anything besides cold medication in 5+ years, but I don't expect that to remain true forever. 

Another huge part of ACA is the exchange subsidies. [RootofGood](http://rootofgood.com/obamacare_makes_early_retirement_easier_and_more_secure/) and plenty of other sites go into it thoroughly, but basically if you're low income  (&lt;3x federal poverty limit) then a fair bit of your insurance premiums will be subsidized. This is definitely a key component if you're looking into a low expense/low income early retirement. However, my two warnings are that 1) the premiums are subsidized, not your cost sharing 2) this assumes the law will mostly remain unchanged. I have no idea what will happen in 20 years. Plenty of pundits have complained that millionaires are getting subsidies on the exchange, congress could theoretically add wealth-based means testing. ACA could be completely overturned or we could switch to a single-payer system, who knows.",finance,1390182358

personalfinance,Need advice/help on how to deal with sibling's constant borrowing and reliance on parents,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I am dealing with an ongoing situation and could really use some advice. I'll try to keep this short. This may be a question for another thread, but since it deals with money and is a situation I'm sure many of you have been through I hope this is the best place for it. I'm using a throwaway to keep this out of my normal account.

My wife's sister and her husband are not good with money. A history of terrible financial decisions, repossessions, overspending, materialism, and no willingness to learn. They have a typical ""I am the victim"" mentality and take no responsibility for their actions. They have both had money problems separately, and then after they started dating and got married it just exacerbated their bad habits. 

Over the past few years my wife's parents have helped them out immensely. Paying for groceries here and there, paying their share of a family vacation (they didn't want them to miss out of course), co-signing for a *new* car loan (which they've missed payments on), paying a deposit on a new apartment, paying medical bills, etc. They constantly manipulate my wife's parents by blaming their situation on bad luck or timing (again playing victim). The most recent was an instance where their dog had to go to the E.R., and they couldn't afford the bill which was due on the spot. They of course asked the parents to pay and took the victim stance saying they couldn't afford it because they don't have credit cards due to their bad credit. The mother is a sweetheart and gets so distraught, and of course won't just say ""sorry, your dog is out of luck"". They make pretty good money, I'd estimate around $60-70k household (they both work).

The big kicker is they are never grateful for the help. They will say ""thanks"" in private, but it is always while holding out their hands for another handout. And then they'll turn around and say things on Facebook that make it sound like they are doing so well financially and can afford new furniture, new flatscreens, new cars, etc. While my wife's sister is at fault as well, the husband is the one that ""pays the bills"" and makes a lot of these decisions to further drive them further in the hole. He has no sense of shame and will readily manipulate a situation to get the mother to help them out. And then he'll have the nerve to turn around and say that he feels like him and the sister are on the bottom rung of the ladder in the family and nobody cares about their welfare. Every month is a new reason that they are being victimized by someone not liking a Facebook status, or that someone didn't say ""hi"" to them in an overly enthusiastic way.

My wife's father is on the verge of retirement and doesn't have a ton of money to throw around. He always says ""it's okay, if I couldn't afford it I wouldn't do it"", and while I don't doubt it, it is stressful and aggravating to see them  hang their heads and hand over the checkbook again and again. We've talked to them many times about how they are only hurting them by giving them money, and enabling their poor financial habits. But every few months its another thing. After years of this it is starting to wear on everyone. It isn't about the money (my wife and I are financially stable) as much as it is that my wife's sister/husband make no effort to improve themselves, and we see it affect the relationships between them and my the parents. 

It is hard to see my wife stress out about it (she talks to her mom regularly through the week and its always something). Her mom doesn't have anyone to talk to other than my wife, so I think it helps her to vent a bit and get it off her chest. After the most recent occurrence at the pet E.R. my wife is at a breaking point where she is so fed up she can't stand to even see or hear about those two. We don't know what the right way to handle the situation which is why I'm turning here.

Is there a good resource for dealing with this type of situation? I know we can't really do much, so should we just cut ourselves off from those discussions entirely? And tell my wife's parents not to tell us of those financial matters anymore? Have any of you been in this situation before and found a way to work through it?  Just writing this out has my blood boiling.

I really appreciate any comments or advice since I am at a loss with what to do.",finance,1390226982

That is nothing new to me. Point being, there is nothing anyone can do to me at this point that would destroy my spirit. &amp;&amp; Now my spirit is backed by the Shibe community. The potential for growth here is limitless for me and its all because of you all. Really, my whole outlook on life has changed and I am a more positive individual. All thanks to doge.

I just have to walk softly and carry a big stick!

When I spoke in front of those people, even though I wasn't ready, I felt empowered. I could see and feel the whole crowd responding to the emotion in my voice. It energized me and I want to do it ALOT more. Every time Ill get better because I am my own competition.

personalfinance,"I make ~$71,000 / year. My only outstanding debt is a 2.9% ~$12,000 Auto Loan. My question to you is: Is the interest rate low enough to justify only paying the minimum monthly ($365) until the end of the loan?","My ultimate financial goal is to buy a house. In order to do this i need to save for a 20% down payment, an emergency fund and additional fees/maintenance costs of the house. I'm a long way away but that's the goal.

I have currently ~$8,000 in savings. I could pay off a large chunk of the auto loan now or just keep slowly paying it off since the interest is so low. My current plan is to continue with the minimum payments and save everything I can. I figure by the time the loan is paid off I would have accumulated enough savings for the house.

personalfinance,Your Direct deposit Form is an Easy Way to Earn More Money,"At the end of the day who doesn’t like to earn more money? Well, you can use your direct deposit form at work to do just that. If you don’t already utilized direct deposit for your paycheck at work then you should. It is an easy way to have your paycheck deposit directly in the account of your choice every payday, and its free. You can also choose multiple accounts to deposit to and decide how much money you want put into each one. And if you add an online savings account to your direct deposit form then, in no time, you will earn more money and have an account with plenty of easy access cash if you need it. 
Online Banks
 
Online banks are banks that do not have actually buildings all over the U.S. that you can go visit, but they still offer the same products and services that you current bank does plus “more”. If you are worried about not having a bank to drive down to, don’t be. These banks have 24/7 support through the Internet and your phone so you can always get any questions that you have answered. You can deposit checks from anywhere using a mobile smart phone and even link your online account to your current bank account and transfer money back and forth for free. Because they do not have buildings all over to maintain and staff they can offer you up to 12x the interest rate a “physical” bank can and reduce or eliminate any fees that go along with your account. There are even online banks that are offering cash bonuses just for opening an account. 
 
Your Direct Deposit Form
 
Now how can you use an online savings account and direct deposit to earn more money? First you need to decide how much less money you can afford to take home each week. There is no amount that is too small and definitely no amount that is too much. Then on your direct deposit form you have that amount of money deposited into your online savings account each paycheck. And then you forget about it. Yes each week you will be bringing home less money but over time you wont even notice it anymore and you will have an account that earns a decent guaranteed interest rate. 
 
Lets say that you can afford to bring home $40 less per week. That is skipping one meal dining out and deciding to eat at home. After a year you will have $2,080 saved up in your online savings account. Plus any sign up bonus that you received and plus all of the interest that you earned throughout the year. And the more you have in your account the more interest you will earn. You just set up your account and forget about it until you need it. 
 
Stick to the Plan
 
Once you set up your online savings account and direct deposit you need to make a rule never to touch the money in your online savings account unless you need it. Everyone can sleep a lot better knowing that they have over $2,000 in an account that is earning interest in case some surprise expenses come up There are usually no fees and your direct deposit will do all of the work for you. Then when you need the money you just transfer it over to your current “physical” bank checking account and you have access to it.",finance,1390245104
personalfinance,23 M Software Developer trying to generate more income,"I graduated May 2012 with a B.S. in Computer Science and have been working at a large financial institution as a Java Developer making $55k/year for the past 16 months or so. Before getting the job, I had virtually no financial background and since starting, I've been trying to study personal finance and investing in my spare time.

I have a traditional 401k through my employer (financial advisor friend recommended traditional over roth) to which I deposit 10% of my paycheck which my employer matches 3%, going up 1% every year up to 5% and I must stay with the company for at least 5 years before I get to keep what they match. My financial advisor friend set up my account to where it made 10-12% for 2013. My 401k account page estimates I'll make about $114k/year in retirement.

Another 5% of my paycheck goes to a regular savings account with 0.05% interest which I think I should instead start depositing into my credit union account that my parents started which currently has about $12k with a 0.5% interest rate. With those two accounts and two other checking accounts, I have about $25.5k in cash.

I tried to get my feet wet with investing back in August by opening up a Scottrade account and buying 25 shares of HBAN at $8.60/share and recently 1 share of MA at $819, both recommendations by someone I consider smart with money. I also decided to have a go at Bitcoin pool mining and bought $1500 worth of equipment which is making me ~$11 worth of BTC per day, after power costs. After 24 days of mining, I've generated about 0.33 BTC and have yet to sell any of it. I check what my hardware is selling for on eBay at least once a week to know when I should resell to try and get my money back.

As far as debt goes, I have 4 student loans, 2 at $6.1k, 1 at $6.5k, and 1 at $3.9k, totaling about $23k all at 6.55% interest. I'm on a plan to repay it in 10 years which makes my payments about $300/month. I have 4 credit cards, one of which is a store card that I NEVER use. I have never missed a payment for any card (or any other bill for that matter).

For living arrangements, I'm currently renting a 2BR 2BA apartment in a good part of town with a friend where my share of rent is $626/month, $80 for utilities, and $65 for cable TV and internet. I've grown very tired of packing lunch everyday for work so I spend maybe an average of $6 a day for lunch and try to cook for dinner. I've calculated that for all living expenses (food/gym/entertainment/gas/etc) I spend about $2000/month.

One last thing (and this isn't really important but you could call it one of my goals in the next year or two), I have a 2008 car with 33000 miles in excellent condition that I've had since senior year of high school and I'm getting tired of driving it. KBB says it has a trade in value of $7k-8k. I'd like an SUV (or maybe crossover). The car was paid for in full.

So, I think that pretty much covers my situation. It's not like I'm struggling to stay afloat or anything but I'd like to make some more sources of income. With $2000/month in living expenses, I think I have about $17k to really start investing with. $11 worth of BTC per day is great but it's just not really doing it for me. I'm very interested in the idea of buying rental properties but I'm a little worried it will cause me all kinds of headaches even if I do hire a property manager. I would like to one day own my own company (or two, maybe a software company) for tax reasons and so that I can set my own hours as working 9-5 everyday really drains the amount of time I have to do anything else.

I've never been the greatest at writing or organizing my thoughts so in case I wrote all of that without asking a question, I'll ask here. With about $17k to invest with, what are some good courses of action I could take to increase my income and become financially free with time to enjoy that freedom? What can I do today? What can I do by the end of this week? This month? This year?

Thanks for any suggestions.",finance,1390245959
personalfinance,Question: payoff debts vs adding to savings,"Wanted to get reddit's opinion on this one.   

Current savings (in money market account): 7.7k (saving at rate of 1500/month)

personalfinance,I want to start paying off my student loans and am looking for advice on how to best do it.,"I'm (26yo) currently in grad school (STEM PhD), for which I receive a stipend and tuition is covered.  I make ~25,000/year and have about 3 years left.  Then, I will probably get a job that pays ~40,000/year for 3-6 years (loans will be continued to be deferred during this period).  After that, hopefully, I will get a final job paying at least 60,000, potentially 80,000+.   I receive no financial support from my family. 

I would like to start paying off my student loans, although they are currently deferred.  

My concerns:
 
* I will likely be moving after I graduate and will need money available to do so.

* My family (parent, siblings) often need money, which I send. Hopefully their financial situation will improve, but not likely in the next year.

**Goal:** to pay off some of my student loans (unsub'd) in the best way possible to minimize the overall amount I will pay on interest. But I need to balance that against having available cash for family and moving within 3 years.

**Question for you all:**

* How can I best tackle these unsub'd loans in my situation?
* Would I be better off to make some investments and pay off the loans later when I make more money?
* Can I pay the principle on these loans and then pay the interest off when they are no longer deferred? (I have asked Sallie Mae but they have never responsed)
* If I pay off one loan (either at once or in payments) will it bring the others out of deferment? (again, a logistical question because SM gives me the cold sholder)
* Any other thoughts?  Maybe burn SM down?  Go off the grid completely and live in the woods? 

Loans:(all currently deferred) I got scholarships for about half of what I needed for school.

* sub'd: 29,282 (int rates between 4.5-6.8) 
unsub'd: 
* principle: 13,743
* interest: 3,791

Other info:

* I rent my apartment, don't think its wise to buy a home since I will be moving around.
* Car loan, $100/mo, interest rate 2.99
* health insurance, covered by grad program
* NO CREDIT CARD DEBT (yaaaaaay me, the only thing I've got going for me;) )
* Current cash: $700
* Current savings: *cough* $300 (Last year was tough and I chewed up a good chunk of my savings after an accident, also sent money to my family)

* I try to live cheaply, the way I was raised. 
* The last few years I spent my extra income each year buy things I've needed for my job/its location (nice work clothes, coats/boots for winter, travel supplies, furniture etc). Now I'm ready to put money towards my loans.",finance,1390250405

personalfinance,"Seeking advice or help on what to do with my money. Relatively financially well off, but not sure on how to maximize my situation (US).","Sorry about the throwaway. I have a lot of friends (including all my roommates) that use Reddit and I am uncomfortable with them potentially knowing all my finances.

Here is my brief summary:

27/F/Bay Area, CA/unmarried

**Job:** Mechanical engineer, salary: $82,300

**Accounts:**

**CapitalOne 360 Savings:** $30,000 @ .75% interest

**CapitalOne Checking:** ~$600 (I put this in there when I opened the account in 2011 and haven’t touched it since)

**Chase Checking account:** ~$4000

**401K:** ~23k (7% out of each paycheck, company pays 100% of first 3% and 50% up to 6%)

**Company stocks** ~10k (right now I upped my contribution to 15% out of each paycheck)

I have **a car** worth about $8k that has been paid off

**No other debt**s other than the 2 main credit cards that I pay off in full each month (Amazon Rewards Card, Marriott Premier Rewards Card).

**Rent:** ~$1k with bills and such. I live in a house with 3 roommates.

I have a pretty good **credit score**: 776

**Other facts:** 
I am not American and I currently am on a Work Visa. My company is in the process of sponsoring me a green card which they estimate will take around 2 more years. This basically means me living in the US is dependent on this job and I have no real guarantee that I will have this job and be able to stay in the country in the future. This is the main reason why I am hesitant about putting more money in my 401k or opening an IRA, should anything change and I am forced to deport.


However, I do realize it is a little foolish of me to have $30k of savings sitting in my savings account at 0.75% interest rate.  I am not very familiar with investing and am not sure what the wisest thing to do is right now.

**Questions:**

1.	What should I do with my savings? Note I also don’t have any relatives in this country so if any misfortune falls on me (knock on wood), I would be on my own financially.

2.	Am I right in being hesitant about putting more in 401k or opening an IRA?

3.	One of my credit cards (Marriott) has an $89 fee a year. The sign up bonus was amazing but I’ve already used it. This card has an available credit of $13,500 (my other no-fee credit card only has $6k) and I think this is one of the main reasons why my credit score is so good.  But I don’t know if the $89/year is worth it? What happens if I close it?

4.	I am very unhappy in my current job and I honestly don’t think I will stay here much longer once I get my green card. I want to go into something to do with wildlife conservation or environmental sustainability; however I am aware that I would be lucky to be making even half of what I do now. I suppose this isn’t really a question, but more of seeking advice on how I can maximize my current financial situation that I likely won’t have anymore should I choose to leave after two years. Also, maybe I need someone to tell me I am crazy or something.

personalfinance,"Extensive debt, have most but not the worst under control.","My early 20s were filled with some of the most irresponsible and stupid decisions I could have made; I acknowledge this, and I have no one to blame but myself. At one point in time this had all driven me to the brink of suicide; fortunately that dark time has passed but I'm still overwhelmed by what I'm still facing. Here's a quick summary:

* Bright eyed and bushy tailed I went to a very expensive university, the majority of which I funded using private loans. I was pursing a non-STEM major (a 'would you like fries with that' major some would likely joke).

* Severe depression, alcoholism, and the inability to pull myself up by my bootstraps resulting in my withdrawing.

* I ignored mounting debt collection letters.

Fast forward a few of years. I'm at a job where the pay is so-so, but not enough to where I don't have my financial worries, but the fat that can be trimmed has been trimmed. I have a private loan for 36k that I am making my monthly payments on and my federal loans, after going through the rehabilitation process have been consolidated and I'm on the Income Based Repayment plan for those. So far, so good. It's less than ideal, but I understand that I have to pay the shitty consequences of my stupidity.

The primary problem is a defaulted private Citibank loan to the tune of $24,000 (currently $27,000 from what I brought up on Quizzle. I don't have the means to pay for this in full and as others are probably aware, private loans offer no options for rehabilitation.

I was contacted in 2012 by a debt collection agency (who validated the debt following my request). They submitted an index application number, I received a summons where I responded affirming most (but not all) of the complaints. And as of June of 2012 that's the last I've heard.

Right now I'm waiting with the axe over my head. I have a potential employment opportunity that may open up that would allow for additional income to come in if it pans out, but it's not a certainty (and even if I get it, it's not going to be enough to pay it all off).

I live in New York which, I believe, offers wage garnishment protections for 90% of the income (generally not including student loans, but this was a private loan).

I'm not trying to skate out on this. I realize I was in the wrong, and I am doing my best to make right on my debts and obligations, but I'm not there yet.

I'm not even sure what I'm really asking, to be honest. If anyone could offer some insight as to the most responsible way to handle this, I'd be grateful.

I know I've left some information out, so I'll clarify as best I can. This has just been especially stressful for me lately.

Bitcoin,I know about services to hack into your own wallet but what about hacking into a wallet with your stolen Bitcoins?,"I know it's probably impossible but I'm just trying to think of any way to get my coins back.  Some lowlife on Craigslist ""sold"" me a KnC Miner for 5.75 Bitcoins and then stopped responding promptly after I sent the final payment and of course I never got the miner.  I know I should have seen all the signs during the negotiation process that he was a fake.  I feel like such a fool right now.  The whole thing just makes me sick.  
Here is the email exchange between us:

Me (via Craigslist reply):  I know this is a long shot but do you still have the miner for sale?

Creep:  Yes, send me an email to BitcoinTexas@gmail.com because Craigslist messaging system is not always reliable.

Me (via email to BitcoinTexas@gmail.com):  Hello, OK, good.  How much do you want for it today? Thanks, Tim

Creep:  5 Bitcoins

Me:  I have cash.  If that works for you, let me know how much in US Dollars you want for it so I can withdraw from the bank.  If not, I'll have to buy Bitcoins on an exchange and that could take a few days.

Creep:  I am not available to meet up with. So cash is not going to work unless you mail it. 
Buying Bitcoins locally (a few people do it on Craigslist) takes a few minutes. 
Paypal takes 21 days for funds to clear (when paying with a CC). 

Me:  You're not available?  So you want me to convert almost $5000 into Bitcoins, give it to you and then what?  I just trust that you'll send it to me?  I would feel much better about making an exchange in-person.  Also, your ad says $3700.  Will you take 4 Bitcoins given that they are at $974 as of right now?  Let's say I go ahead and decide to take a HUGE risk and send you the Bitcoins.  Is there any way you can assure me that I'll get the hardware?

Creep:  5 Bitcoins is the price in Bitcoins. 
The $ in the ad was for people to know how much it was worth in dollars. Since eBay and Craigslist does not currently have an option for Bitcoin, the dollar price is needed for comparison purposes. 
Weather or not the USD to Bitcoin is $1 or $100,000, the sale price is 5 Bitcoins.

So, I went ahead and deposited money into a wallet on BlockChain.info but it takes a day to clear and you are limited to $2500 a day so I'll deposit $2500 more tomorrow.

Another guy wanted to do a PayPal transaction but it takes 21 days for the funds to clear.
I am not a big business and can not risk him doing a charge back so I refunded him the total amount and now it's back on the market.

Me:  Great!  Thanks.  I'll be in touch.

Creep:  Got the 2 last night.
How did you want it shipped?

Me:  I know you said you use Lone Star Overnight but I was wondering if you could ship it via FedEx overnight or if overnight is too expensive then FedEx two-day shipping is fine too.  My address is ... Some Street(edited for privacy), Austin, TX 78745. When the rest of my coins arrive today I'll send them to you.  Thanks!

Me (again):  Ok, I just sent the remaining 3 Bitcoins to you just now.  Please send the system to: Timothy Howe, ... Some Street, Austin, TX 78745  Thanks for all you patience.  I'm looking forward to getting it!  Take care, Tim

Creep:  Hey Tim.  I have been talking to a guy in Houston who said he would give me 6 Bitcoins on Monday for the miner.
If you can match that, I will ship it Monday morning (using FedEx like you wanted).
If not, I will just refund your 5 Bitcoins and apologize for wasting your time.
Have a good one.
Jake

Me:  Hi Jake,  All I have is .77361 Bitcoin in my wallet.  I can send that right away but if you want me to match the full 1.0 Bitcoin, I can't get more money in my wallet until Tuesday via Blockchain.info.  So, it's your call.  Just let me know.  Thanks, Tim

Creep:  Just round down to .75 Bitcoin and I will ignore all further emails. 

Me:  Ok, I sent it.  Thanks, Tim

Me (the next day):  Hi Jake,  Were you able to send it out today?

Me (the day after that):  Hello.  Just wondering if you were able to send it yet?  Thanks, Tim

Me (later that night):  It's been a couple of days since I've heard from you.  Just let me know what's going on please.  Thanks, Tim

I got the interest rate reduced to 6.55% by signing up for auto-debit payments through Sallie Mae.

My question is, when I make extra payments, is it better to just push out my due date, or to put it towards the principle? I've already paid a few payments out, so my next due date isn't until April, but the auto-debit will make my monthly payment no matter what that says.

But I don't really know and I'd really like advice or understanding. I probably have one shot to convince them if in fact it is a bad move.

Volume is roughly 20-40K EUR and the money would have to return to the eurozone eventually - they're not planning to move to NZ.",finance,1390263928
Bitcoin,PSA: Scammers are sending spoofed emails from Bitrated,"We received multiple reports today (see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423843.0)) of people getting spoofed emails that appear to come from [Bitrated](https://www.bitrated.com/). The email says that an arbitrated transaction was created and provides a Bitcoin payment address the buyer should pay to.

**Bitrated never sends payment addresses in emails. Do NOT pay to those addresses.**


The process of using Bitrated should look like that:

- Both parties must use the interface to generate a key pair. This is done automatically when initiating/joining a transaction.
- Both parties must agree to the terms. One party initiates the transaction, and the joining party should receive a link where he accepts the terms.
- After both parties agree, the website interface will provide the multisig address. **This is the only multisig address you should ever make payments to.**
- Again, payment addresses are NEVER sent in emails. Currently, Bitrated never sends any emails at all. There are also no numerical transaction IDs (which appears in the emails, though they're likely to change that now).

To make it harder to spoof emails from our domain, we will also setup [DKIM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) and [SPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) on our mail servers. This should help users whose email clients support that.

Please be careful. Someone lost 7.5 BTC with that scam today.",cryptocurrency,1390265396
personalfinance,Time to develop a financial/investment strategy...looking for advice (long post).,"I recently took a new job with a pretty decent bump in pay. My wife and I have been avoiding investing, etc. for awhile, and we know it's time to get started. We're both in our very early 30s, no kids (none planned, either). I looked into a fee-based financial planner, but it seems that the pricing makes them impractical for our income/asset level.

I'm relatively financially savvy, but my wife isn't. I could use guidance, and she would really like some. I've laid out our basic situation below and would like some direction on where to go for more detailed advice (books, websites, companies, etc.) to help us make some investing choices. 

I currently manage our money with a spreadsheet, but have started to use Mint to keep better track of the granular details. 

You'll see below that I have substantial student loans (damn private law school).  I'm considering a private refinance of them, which should result in lower interest and quicker payoff. Downside is I lose the ability to forebear if I lose my job, etc. I can't seem to locate the website I was looking at right now, but I've seen rates around 5% (down from my current 7.1). My current loans are all federal.  I'm open to thoughts on this. By my math, my payment would go up about $100/mo and my payment term would be halved. 

Budget (starting in Feb, first full month of new job):

Income - ~$180,000 per year combined ($136k and $43k)
Savings - $25,000 in savings account, constant $1500 buffer in checking
Investments - $0

Debt:
Student Loans - $170k
House - $200k
Cars - $50k (between 2 cars, 2012 and 2013)

Monthly fixed (roughly $5000 total, excluding eating out, comprised mostly of the below):

Income - $9700 (net, after 500 IRA contribution)
Mortgage - $1350
Student loan - $1278
Cars - $888 (both)
Internet/Hulu/Netflix- $65
Utilities - $225
Cell Phone - $100
Car insurance - $90
Gas - $550
Groceries - $400
Eating out/snacks/coffee - $1000
Travel fund - $500 (goes into it's own account)
Flying club dues- $85

Savings contribution - $2000 + anything else left over at end of the month. 

Would like to use the $2000 savings contribution to get savings account up to either $30 or 40k (6-8 months of expenses) as a liquid emergency fund, then start putting that money into an investment account of some sort. 

I will be putting $500 per month into my 401k at work (some match after a year, odd formula), but I've taken that into account in the net income above. 

I'm not really looking for advice as to reducing my budget, but for advice on how to best develop and manage an investment plan (and for input on the student loan refinance). Budget provided primarily to add context. 

I know about Vanguard and Schwab, but I'm hesitant to take much advice from someone who works on commission. So, looking for books and other self-help resources to get me started. 

Thanks in advance, and I'm happy to provide more info if helpful.",finance,1390269551

personalfinance,Just quit my job straight up. Am I making a mistake?,"Throwaway here. 

I just gave my two week notice to my boss today. Currently don't have another job lined up (but I honestly don't know if I want one). I'm 24, this was my second job out of college (quit the first one as well). 

I'm honestly just so fed up with the business world. Shitty managers. Endless amounts of pointless meetings that accomplish little to nothing. The work is dry and I find little to no meaning in it. Very little human interaction (I work in software). I don't feel like I'm improving anyone's life with my work.

I don't have much of an emergency fund saved up. My boss lost his cool and blew up on me on Friday - that was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back. Some people may tolerate verbal abuse but I just don't.

I'm applying to law school and I really want to work overseas in international/economic development. Does anyone have any experience working in this space? How did you break in? I can't figure out how to get from here to there...

So for now I guess I'm just gonna do part time work and maybe start a business. Idk what else to do. I feel like the last 1.5 yrs have been a complete waste. Everything is just fucked. How do people stand to work in the business world? I just don't get it.

personalfinance,My wife just tweaked on me because of my school loans. I'm feeling somewhat hopeless. Any advice?,"Ugh, bad....so, here's my situation: I started law school with around 40k in undergrad school loans. I was hoping to only add to that by about 110k, but it ended up being 150k. Tonight, my wife just saw for the first time, that my loans are a grand total of 187k with an average interest rate of 6.9%. She tweaked on me (maybe rightfully). I am (often overly) optimistic and assumed the future will be fine, but now that they are about to come due, and we are hoping to buy a house and have children, I've realized I should maybe have foregone my dream of going to law school and just focused on my construction business.
Here are my stats etc.

The good(ish):
1. No revolving debt
2. Cars paid off (15k value)
3. Already live fairly frugally
4. I am a contractor/carpenter as well as soon to be JD
5. I make around 30k a year while in school (this could/ would substantially rise if I devote myself to the business)
6. Wife makes around 30k a year
7. Great credit (her 800+ and me mid 700)
8. 25k in savings
9. In a decent market for attorneys and I do have some connections

The Bad (and ugly):
1. Renting: $1,700 mo.
2. Would like to buy a house, and really we need to. I can fix/build anything in a house and it's really foolish for us not to have bought previously
3. Have only two years of showing income (45k 2012; 55k 2013)
4. 187K in school loans that become due in late 2014 ($2,175mo. for standard repayment)
5. Starting an entirely different career
6. Hoping (and needing to soon, we are both late 30s) to have at least one child

This coming paycheck, I’m getting my signing bonus of $2,000, which I plan on putting towards my credit card to pay it off, and set aside as the beginnings of my new emergency fund. My goal is to furnish my apartment (I live with my boyfriend, and we have almost no furniture between the two of us) and build a solid emergency fund before my loans come due in July. I’m on the graduated federal plan, which means that the minimum payments for my federal loans will be very, very low for the first two years. I plan to use that time to pay down my private loans (hopefully knock them out in ~2 years), as they are the highest interest rate and my father is the co-signer. After that, I plan on knocking out each federal loan in order of highest interest first. In the case of same interest rates, I’m going to work on the smallest principal loan and then roll that minimum payment into the next. I have a HDHP (Deductible is about 1500), which is why I’m trying to put some money away in my HSA. I haven’t had insurance in about five years, so I’m going to need some dental work done, as well as glasses and a well woman’s visit. I’d like to know your thoughts about my financial plan!

This is module 1, a big picture module. 
MODULE I - MACROECONOMICS AND FINANCE
Provides a global macroeconomic picture of financial markets. You'll understand what moves markets, how different markets are correlated, and how to interpret important global developments and financial news. Understanding this macro picture is critical to anyone interested in understanding the financial world we live in. By the end of this module, you'll be in a position to follow your areas of interest and understand how these pieces come together.
Course I (Intro to Financial Markets) provides a detailed explanation of various financial asset classes, how they work, and using Chart analysis, demonstrates how various asset classes are correlated or inversely correlated.
Course II (Global Money Machine) looks at global money flows in detail - developed markets,emerging markets, frontier markets etc. Analysis of investment trends and opportunities, Index funds, and the concept of Alpha.
Course III (US Stocks Indices and ETFs) is a detailed look at the U.S. Stock market, major indices, and an in-depth look at the dazzling array of ETFs available for every possible investment.
Course IV (US Bond Market) covers the Bond Market, quite possibly THE most important market to understand. How are Bonds are connected to interest rates, inflation, money printing, Federal Reserve operations and much more.
In Course V (Smart Money), we take a fascinating look at what ""Smart Money"" is, who they are, how they operate in the markets, and how we can track or follow them for our financial benefit. Following smart money is one of the most profitable market strategies, and this course shows how we can do this on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.

personalfinance,"Student debt, emergency fund, or 401k?","Between paying off student loans, building an emergency fund, and contributing to my 401k, which should I be focused on first?  Or should I contribute equally to all of these?


Details:


Student Loans:  I currently have 4 student loans equaling $22,450.  They are all federal direct loans with 6.8% interest.  They are all being serviced by the same company and I am currently making the minimum payment which is approximately 12% of my monthly take home pay.  I recently realized that about half of each payment goes towards the principal.  It makes me crazy that half of that payment is basically being thrown away because it goes towards the accruing interest.


401K:  I just started contributing to a 401k as this is the first time I've been eligible.  I am currently contributing 3% as this is what my employer matches, although I won't be fully vested in my employers contributions for something like 5 years.  Without having much time to research, I signed up for the generic option with a level of risk between high and moderate (i.e. one level below the highest risk category).


Emergency Fund:  I am currently contributing 5% of my take home pay to a savings account which is earning next to no interest.  My goal is $10,000 which will cover somewhere between 3 and 6 months of living expenses.  I currently have about $2,500 saved.  It will take me 5 years to reach $10,000 at this rate.


So, to sum up:  Currently, student loans are 12% of my take home pay, emergency fund is 5% of my take home pay, and 401k is 3% of my gross income.  I am open to any and all suggestions.  But most importantly, if I am to choose one of these three things to focus on, which should it be and what should I do?  It might be relevant to state that I am 30 years old.  I see stories on here all the time that are inspiring.  So, this is my first step.  Thank you!",finance,1390322427

Finally, in Course VII is the Great Bond trade. This is a long-term trade designed to profit from a rise in interest rates. It's not a question of if that happens, but when. And when it happens, this trade can explode. And meanwhile, you can make the trade absolutely free of cost, meaning zero loss. You have to see it to believe it. And since the macroeconomic picture is very well understood by now, you'll see why this trade makes a lot of sense.

dogecoin,"If you are coming from BTC, LTC, Peercoin, Namecoin or any other currency, or if you are simply new - please read this as it helps this community.","Hi Guys and Gals,

I just wanted to welcome you, and to let you know that this is a friendly community. The main reason for such growth of this currency is because it has always been a friendly community. It attracted people who were fed up with being mistreated, ignored, and people who simply like to be around other friendly people. This raised it's value, not only the value of the dogecoin itself, but the value that the members find in the community.

It is imperative that we as a community continue on this path if you would like to see your investments (and friendships) grow. Obviously no one can tell you what to do with your money. It is yours, spend it as you will. If you want to tip, by all means, tip. It is actually more rewarding than you might think if you have never done it. If you don't want to tip - no problem. Traders, investors, tippers alike, we are all unified because we are all part of something big here. We are building a currency that can take the world by storm. It can create new trends by allowing people to give someone halfway around the globe in the wee hours of the morning when all the stores and shops are closed a tip of actual value at the stroke of a few keys. 

Dogecoin AND the community make people feel good. When you make people feel good, they want to invest in you. They want to invest in what makes them feel those positive feelings. They appreciate those feelings. It draws them to you. It keeps them investing in you. It keeps them coming back. And it goes both ways. It does something wonderful for you as well. It makes you feel good, to make someone else feel wanted and worthwhile. Being nice, believe it or not, feels nice. That is what has grown this community, that is what will keep it growing. That is why we are succeeding. We are all humans, some of us wealthy, some of us living in poverty, but we all share a need to belong to something. No one likes being lonely, no one likes being left out. We all want to belong. That is what made this community so valuable. That is why dogecoins are growing in value as more people participate, and if you continue on this trend; you will not only have more valuable dogecoins but you will have spent your time more valuably as well. I hope we all get to the moon. Remember, being nice pays off. Especially when the community is what will propel this rocket forward.",cryptocurrency,1390325365

Last time I went in they offered me a load with an 11% interest rate, which blew my mind. I was all ready to sign on the dotted line, because I really want to get them off my back and get this paid off, but with the high interest rate and time-frame they want me to pay (5 years if I recall) I couldn't afford the monthly payments (~$500/month biweekly).

Now that I've gotten my shit together and actually know what my finances are like, I believe I can now afford that $500/month (thanks r/frugal) but that's going to put my ass to the fire with how I live my life.

My question: should I be playing hardball with that interest rate, or should I just take what they are giving me and put my nose to the grindstone? 

I'm not opposed to living like a monk until I get a pay raise/new job and I have some additional funds, but I feel like if I switch banks or call them on their ludicrous interest rate they might cut me a deal. I'm meeting with my bank again in about a week. My current plan of paying it off on my own time, until it's low enough to turn in to a loan I can afford doesn't seem to be working very well.

Any advice would be helpful.",finance,1390326904

personalfinance,"Is it better to use my tax refund on my emergency fund, car loan or credit card balance?","Just some information, I currently have an emergency fund of only about $5000. I don't feel completely comfortable with it but it's decent. I'd definitely like to increase it to have that safety net and therefore, I'm tempted to transfer my tax refund (which is historically around $2500) to that account. The problem is that I have a couple of debts that I really want to get rid of, each with a different scenario.

The first one is my car loan, which currently sits at a balance of around $6000. Now my interest on this loan is great, less than 2%, but my monthly payments are kind of brutal. They are currently at $360. I really want to pay off the car in order to free up $360 a month, which would be huge. That is my largest bill.

My other big debt is a CC bill of about $2600. I know CC debt is bad and this Credit Card carries an APR of about 15% so it's pretty rough. Paying this down is of high priority for me as well because obviously, I'm just giving away money with that interest rate. Any extra money I have I'm trying to toss towards this balance normally. I also have essentially shoved this card deep in a drawer and am no longer using it.

I am mostly torn on whether to apply this money towards my car or my credit card bill. I suppose I could use this refund plus most of my emergency fund on paying off my car and freeing up $360 a month, but I would not feel comfortable with such a low emergency fund.

What do you all recommend as the best option? Pay off CC, add it to my emergency fund or use the return + most of my emergency fund to pay off my car?

Husband has a **401(k)** through his employer. Do I have any clue of any of the details about it? Nope. I am assuming we need to get the paperwork from HR to review. Here's the catch: I have no effing clue how an account like this should be distributed. Any links to resources or advice appreciated. 

We have an **emergency fund** of about $5,000 which would cover our mortgage payment, food, car payments, and gas (the bare minimum essentials) for 3 months--but the catch is this fund doesn't cover the cost of our son's daycare. We need about $8k to cover that for a few months. 

Between the two of us we have **no student loan debt**, and maybe $1500 between our 2 credit cards. We're not super serious about paying that off because I took a major pay cut (living on a stipend) for one year in an attempt to gain marketable job skills. College is *useful*!

Husband is a teacher, we take home roughly $33,000 after taxes. 

**Mortgage**: I have no idea how to analyze any of the mortgage paperwork. We have all the info at the house but I have no clue what kind of loan he got (bought the house before I knew him), or how much we owe and how that all works out with interest. The house was about $100k and he put down $3k. I wouldn't have made that decision but it is what it is. I am not on any of the paperwork (the marriage is very new hence why I am here). Should I be?

**Car loan**: Bought a used car, put down $2k and financed $8k. His loan is through wells fargo. No clue what the interest rate is. 

Our monthly income is roughly $3000 combined, but my stipend ($940 per month) goes almost entirely to our son's **childcare** (averages $750/month) and the rest is spent on groceries, gas to work, and my morning lattes. 

Baby #2 is coming in a few months.  

We live a very modest lifestyle: no cable, no new cars (my mom is letting me drive one of hers for free and I pay for maintenance and insurance), if we want new furniture we get it off Craigslist or go to Ikea. My husband's phone is almost 4 years old and my MIL gave me her phone for free. We pay $30/month for our phone useage due to being on a family plan with his parents, otherwise neither of us would even have smartphones with data plans.

 Our biggest problem with money is eating out. With both of us working full time we get take-out more than we should. Honestly we don't even know how much per month goes to this. At least $200. 


I have a TERM ($250,000) **life insurance** policy that I pay $35/month for. 

I think that covers it. We try not to take on any debt we don't have to. We haven't added to our credit card balances in almost a year.


**I know I'm completely stupid and I don't want to be anymore. Please help get me started. What should our top priorities be when saving and planning for our future and our childrens' future?** Although we have an emergency fund, I feel like we are just barely keeping ahead of living paycheck to paycheck, so I feel overwhelmed thinking of saving.

My quality of life would go up immensely if I had that extra $500 every month instead of the loan payments. Should I just be paying the loans off as aggressively as I can?

personalfinance,"Refinance auto loan to improve credit score, or pay it off to avoid interest?","I bought a car recently and was convinced by the dealer to finance it. I've been working for a while, have good credit, and am looking to save up to buy a home- the salesman suggested that I get a loan and pay it off after a year and a half, claiming that it would help raise my credit score, which would help future home financing. My credit score was already around 750, and he claimed that 800 or so would be better, but that would only achievable by having a substantial use of credit.

Long story short, I foolishly bought into his plan and only later realized that the interest rate for the auto loan was worse than going to a bank or credit union, or indeed other dealers. If I was to pay off the loan in full in eighteen months, I would be only short a few hundred dollars, which isn't a huge loss for me. But should I even bother continuing financing for the sake of growing credit? And if so, should I try refinancing the vehicle? If not, should I just pay it off now, before the interest kicks in?

personalfinance,Credit report and debt help,"I have some debts. It's a long, drawn out, pathetic story full of severe medical problems, medical bills, and bad decision making but I'm slowly taking care of it.

Early last year, I was finally able to pay off the majority of my debt, including the medical bills. I've worked really hard to get out of this hole and I've gotten much better with money. I take responsibility for pretty much everything, except my federal student loan. They completely screwed up and lost all my information and couldn't find me when I called repeatedly trying to set up payments. I'd filed federal tax returns every year, they still had my social, but ""couldn't pull me up.""

Finally, a creditor got in touch with me (using my social and federal tax returns--how about that!?). It turns out that the federal lender lost all of my information except an address that I had *years* ago and my balance. They lost my cosigner, my subsequent addresses, my school information, my phone numbers, etc., all of which I'd updated with them regularly. This put me into collections for a loan I was actually trying and able to pay on time before it ever went there.

I'm on the federal student loan rehabilitation program that should be up in two months. Then the account goes back to the original lender and out of collections. Unfortunately, the federal lender has my loan broken down into 8 separate delinquencies on my credit report. My first question is this: once this goes back to the federal lender after the completion of the rehabilitation program, my account is supposed to be in good standing. Will this remove the 8 (!!!!) negative dings on my credit report? What the hell do I have to do to convince them to correct this?

My second question is regarding the debts I've already paid off in full through collection agencies. Some of them are showing up on my credit reports as charge offs, which I understand I can't do anything about. I'm wondering if there's a way to have the fact that I paid the accounts off in full posted, as well. I would like to show that I don't have any open, outstanding account balances despite them having been charged off.

Lastly, regarding debt itself. My only outstanding debt (outside of the student loans) is $4000 owed to the University of California--one of the main reasons I can't go back to school. The account is not in collections at this time, though it's long delinquent. The UC refuses to set up a payment plan longer than a year. I cannot pay them $4000 in a year making monthly payments. I could possibly mange a two year plan. Meanwhile, the account is accruing interest.

Would it be best if I just started paying them what I can afford every month and have it go toward my balance despite not being on a payment system with them? Is this a terrible idea? Should I just hang onto the money and try to pay it all in one lump sum?

Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just having trouble finding an answer for the specifics of my situation. I really appreciate any help you all could offer!

**TL;DR:**

* With the federal student loan rehabilitation program, will my credit report be cleaned up once I've been 'forgiven' and am making regular, timely payments with them?

* I understand that I have to live with the charge offs on my credit reports. Is there also a way to reflect that I've paid these off in full so it doesn't look like they're still sitting there unpaid?

* What's the best way to pay off a large sum of debt when they refuse to offer me a reasonable payment plan? Let it sit and save up to pay in one lump sum or just send them whatever I can afford every month despite not being on a plan?",finance,1390353746

Some info:

**Myself:**
I am 23, M, Bachelors Degree in Psychology, lab/research experience in Cognitive/Neuropsychology. My wildest dreams are a PhD in a relevant field (projected income for neuropsychologists is 90K average), but I really just want to support myself and a family, and am willing to do what ever it takes for that, if it means earning less and working a different career.

**Outgoing/Debt:**
~50K student loans from bachelors degree. Account balance through Great Lakes loan servicer is 47.5K. I also have a private loan through Well's Fargo currently at $1,800. I make $550 monthly payments on the federal loans, and whenever I can I throw as much as I can into the private loan. I also recently discovered that one of my school loan was not federal but through the school itself, and is $5,000, minimum payments of $50/month. I will make the first payment on this in the next week.

~$8,000 car loan. I pay $200/month, where the minimum is $190. I know, I shouldn't have financed, but this was an internal struggle with myself that I'd be happy to elaborate on in comments.

$144/month car insurance.

I also have a Wells Fargo Rewards credit card with a $1500 limit. I have been using it as my primary payment method for food/spending money. I will not let it accumulate over $400. Honestly, I've been bad at spending too much with it, and have been working to cut that down so I can be sure to pay it off each month.

**Assets/Income**
I work as a cashier at a Kroger affiliate grocery store making 11.63/hr, an average of about 28-30 hrs per week. My average weekly take-home paycheck is about $250-275, sometimes over $300 (due to sunday and late night premium pay and holiday pay)

I live with family; no rent, and few food expenses. the food expenses I have are treating myself and my GF, or buying lunch at the grocery store I work at.

Every week I put $50 into savings account. I saved up $300 before I had to use 100 to cover myself when I spent too much on my credit card in December (holiday trips and shopping).

Super cheap health insurance through work. A local dental clinic works with our union so dental is free to me.

**Possibilities/Should I.....**
I have an interview coming up for a job as a behavioral therapist for autistic children. The pay is $15/hr, but starts with only ""10-20 hrs per week"". I would have to decrease my hrs at Kroger to do this, but work both jobs to afford everything.

Kroger offers me 401K. I know absolutely nothing about 401K other than it's good. They also offer retirement plans and a bunch of other awesome benefits.

I could continue to look for a more full time/salaried position in mental health or research. I live in a major city (Seattle, WA) so this is possible. However, getting a job like this will be much more difficult.

I'm also pretty satisfied at my current job because there are very good avenues for advancement in the company, right up to corporate level, and the company has given me a very good impression. I can pay off debts here and live a happy life. But I'll never go above that to what I really am passionate about there, and in order to do so, I feel like I have to take too many risks.

1st loan: $8,500 subsidized and $4,903 unsubsidized

3rd loan: $17,000 subsidized and $44,500 subsidized

I'm a couple of months before my grace period ends and don't have any minimum payments yet. I'm considering the following plan (s), but am amenable to changes if something makes better sense:

1. Refi the grad plus loan, apply for IBR/ICR/PAYE with the stafford loans and pay more (but won't put me into default, as I have relatively strong credit history and don't want to default if I can avoid it). 
2. Find the best consolidation rate and then pay off the lump amount payments to simplify the matter and potentially accrue less interest over time. 
3. Apply for longer deferment because this stuff drives me ape-shit.

finance,Idea for a more modern currency.,"I was thinking of a way to create a currence with an intrinsic value without something as simple as a single good backing it. Tell me what you think of this. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible:

A central bank chooses a select number of goods as being liquid and stable enough to back a currency. These goods are chosen to be as diverse as possible so they're representative of the economy as a whole.

The central bank acts as a market maker for debt backed with these goods. It loans out money to people willing to offer the goods as collateral, and it sells the debt to private bidders. The debt's face value is roughly the market value of the backing asset, and it also has a fixed interest rate. The central bank facilitates each transaction so that it ends up holding asset-backed debt. Because the central bank is holding this debt, there is cash outstanding which has been loaned out but not taken up in the sale of this debt to private bidders. The outstanding cash is balanced with the face value of the good-backed debt, and that's how the cash is backed. The idea is that the cash can be exchanged for good-backed debt at any time.

Because there are two prices per transaction (the price of the backing good and the cost of money (interest) ), one price can be altered by the adjustment of the other. If interest rates are altered manually, they can be used to adjust the price of the backing good. As interest rates rise, the price of the backing good will naturally follow, as lenders will be more willing to accept a greater valuation of the good in exchange for the payoff of the higher interest, and borrowers will be more reluctant to offer goods to back loans at higher interest.

Given that prices are adjustable by interest rate, the central bank is free to adjust prices by altering interest rates in each transaction. So, for all loans used in this system to create cash, the central bank assigns one interest rate. The more borrowers there are seeking loans, the lower the valuations they'd be willing to accept for backing goods would be, and vice-versa. However, the central bank can adjust interest rates to ensure aggregate price stability of backing goods: in this market, *the sum of the prices of all goods backing cash is constant. When aggregate prices rise at a given interest rate, the central bank adjusts interest rates on these cash-creating loans so that prices fall, and vice-versa.*

This forced stability of aggregate prices would create a pure medium of exchange - one where the relative values of goods change, but aggregate prices stay the same.

The cash supply would be regulated by the central bank. If the current cash supply should remain unchanged, the central bank facilitates each transaction at equilibrium prices. If the cash supply should increase, the central bank facilitates each transaction at above-market prices (so that more debt is issued than is sold, increasing outstanding cash), and so on

The idea is that this cash would, despite wide variance in interest rates and relative pricing over time, always be worth the same sum of all backing goods. Also, it would separate inflationary and deflationary pressure from the value of currency completely - inflationary and deflationary pressure would only alter interest rates and necessitate adjustments in the cash supply, but the value of the cash itself would rise and fall with aggregate prices.

So... am I a lunatic or what? Can anybody respond to that, even to say I should pack my things and leave? Thanks.",finance,1390418817

My current credit score is rated Excellent due to my timely payments, with the biggest problem being my length of time. Other monthly expenses are:

Plan B (Free Pay):

I recently had the fortune of being granted a large bonus for my performance in 2013.

My bonus was ~$18,600 ($18000 base bonus, 600 for working overtime). I'm aware that this amount is subject to Medicare, Social Security, California income tax, etc...

What gives? Shouldn't that $621 still have gone towards fleshing out my 401K because I have not hit the contribution ceiling yet? 



UPDATE: Thanks for the feedback and input, everyone. My employer clarified what's going on here. In so many words, the 401k doesn't reduce taxable wages for SS, Medicare, SDI, etc... These taxes still need to be withheld, and if they were to allocate the full bonus amount to 401k, there would be not be sufficient wages to cover those withholdings. As a result, some of the bonus needs to be set aside, separate from the 401k deduction, to cover those 3. The funds set aside are consequently subject to State and Fed income tax.",finance,1390421226

I have literally no savings whatsoever, I dump every paycheck I get into a checking account and pay all my bills and expenses from there and break even every month. So there's that. But, I have 0 credit card debt since I pay off all my bills every single month, and I don't have a car, so… at least I don't worry about car payments, emergency repair expenses, etc.?


I have about $14k in federal consolidated student debt, though with my income-based-repayment plan I currently am not required to pay anything per month (I do still get charged interest, 6.55% fixed it looks like). I think this coming year my payment will go up slightly but will still be quite low.


Further, I have about $15k that I owe my parents for a loan they took out on my behalf for grad school (long story, did grad program abroad, in retrospect I wish I had not done this for their sake but c'est la vie.) They are thankfully being very, very generous with their repayment plan, and so far I have just been paying off what I can, when I can.


In filling out my tax return, it looks like I will get back over $1000 this year, the first time I've ever had that much (ha) back. I have looked into a Roth IRA at Vanguard, specifically the STAR account, which only requires $1000 to open and seems like a safe bet for a beginner. My parents are retirement age and only just now starting to think about real investing, so even despite all the money I owe them, they are really encouraging me to go for the IRA or something similar so that I don't go through the last minute pre-retirement scramble they are experiencing.


My heart is telling me to give it all to my parents, my parents are telling me to put it all in a long-term investment, my head is telling me to pay off my federal student loans as much as possible, my wanderlust says fuck it and go couch surf in Latin America for a week or two.

I had an awesome idea today to raise more money for charity and spread the word of all that is Dogecoin, but first I would like to give you a bit of info before I go into my idea.


I am part of the Federally Registered Non-Profit Organization known as LANFest. We help throw LAN Parties across the US to help raise money for charities. One of our biggest events we are involved in are Events at PAX East and Prime. 

I am in charge of one of our smaller events in Sacramento,CA - Which is a 100 Man LAN we are having this Weekend

For More info Go Here: https://lanfest.intel.com/events/great-escape-iv

While at work today I had an awesome idea I'm gonna try out at this LAN, where I will get as many volunteers as i can to donate their PC time to Mine for Dogecoin.
I will create a new Wallet for the soul purpose of collecting the Dogecoins for LANFest Organization.
During the event I will have an orientation on what Dogecoin is and how it works and what I am trying to do and have them join a Pool with me.
I will do this at both this Smaller LAN and also at our Sister Event LAN held at Intel (Folsom, CA) where we have 450+ Attendees.
Hopefully we will have a nice collection of Dogecoins over time from our several events through out the year... and when the Value of the Dogecoin hits $1, the total sum will be donated to the Charities that we support. (United Way of Sacramento, United Way of Northern California, and more!)


I would like, is this community's input on this idea and what do you guys think and if you have any ideas to improve on this, that would be awesome.
 
Tips are also welcome and will be put into the Donation Wallet.

personalfinance,"Helping my dad figure out his bills, mom dying.","My mom has end stage cancer and I am trying to figure out a way my father will be able to hang on to his home.

His bills:
Mortgage - 125k left to pay. I'm not sure the interest rate but I think it was refinanced before the market crash in 2008.

Equity loan - 100k outstanding. He has an equity loan he just started paying not too long ago. He used the money to put me through college, bought a boat and an airplane (yeah a fucking airplane). Not sure the interest rate.

He owns a car in good shape worth about 5k and has a lease on a dodge ram. He pays 350 a month on the ram. His lease is up this summer, he can buy out for 20k. He really needs to hold onto the ram as he needs it for work etc.

Owns a boat outright now worth 10k

Owns an airplane outright worth maybe 10-15k (it's old and you would not want to fly in it).

Has 5k in credit card debt.

Real estate taxes in nj are 9k/year on his property.

My mom does not have much longer with us. That said, he is set to inherit the following:

Her life insurance: should be around 130k
401k #1: 150k
401k #2: not sure but I think 20k in there (small amount)

He is 62 and makes 80k a year. He has his own life insurance etc.

His goal has always been to retire using Medicare/Medicaid as health insurance eventually because he will never be eligible for health benefits after retirement from his current employer. He would like to work a few more years, sell the house for 500k and retire near me in VA where taxes are low and real estate is cheap.

My number one thought would be to take the life insurance pay out and pay off the mortgage, not sure where to go for there...I am a scientist not a finance major.",finance,1390436819

personalfinance,Zero Interest Loan,"edit: i have read the side bar

Hey Everyone

I recently bought a house with a 5 down% conventional loan (yes they exist) with a interest rate of 3.8%. Incase you are not familiar with this type, it is similar to a what the FHA was meaning that I have to pay PMI until at least 20% and at least two years into the loan. Once I own 20%of the home/principle I can apply to have PMI removed. I have this loan with BANK A.

Now what I think is a good, but could use some advise. 

My other bank, BANK B just offered me a 0% interest loan for one year to pay of debt of any kind. Most people will use this for big items they bought during the holiday season or CC debt.  But I want to use it to pay down my mortgage so I can get closer to owning 20% of my home and to pay less interest over the course of the loan. Now I'm not talking taking out a loan for a huge amount, The amount will be $3000 which would be and extra $250 a month for the next year on top of the month mortgage bill. I can afford this, I need help with the next part. 

Now the fun part.

I ran the numbers with amortization rates, only considering Ill be at this house for 5 years, and that extra $3000 toward the principle today would reduce about $500 in interest patents and therefore increasing the principle about $500 as well. (on top of the 3000, and regular months payments for 5 years)

So am I doing the math right? Well, is the theory right? the math is wrong because I rounded. Does this make sense? 

Bank A Mortgage amount 140,000, 3.8%
Bank B Loan amount: $3000 0%, for only one year, After that 14% &lt;-the kicker

Course VI - Priceline Earnings explosion is a trade just before Priceline released its earnings report. Call it what you may, one thing is for sure - this is a trade on Steroids. What a beauty !
Finally, in Course VII is the Great Bond trade. This is a long-term trade designed to profit from a rise in interest rates. It's not a question of if that happens, but when. And when it happens, this trade can explode. And meanwhile, you can make the trade absolutely free of cost, meaning zero loss. You have to see it to believe it. And since the macroeconomic picture is very well understood by now, you'll see why this trade makes a lot of sense.

gaming,Just a happy story about Sony customer support,"So my brother camped out and picked me up a PS4 on launch day. Best birthday present ever? I think so. He sent it down to me (I live in NM, he's in Rochester) and I couldn't wait to hook it up..... OH NO! I got the mysterious Blue Light of Death. So I went online to Sony support, which had a bunch of probably-good-but-in-my-case-not-helpful tips on what to do, and a support line, and an online chat. The chat was full, so I thought, what the heck, I'll try the phone and if I'm on hold for 45 minutes, maybe that's still faster.

They picked up *right* away, knew the problem, walked me through a couple of unsuccessful quick-fixes, and immediately dispatched a service box. It was so easy. I was blown away.

So a week goes by of no box, and finally I call back -- again, no wait time whatsoever, I get through right away. They send out another -- at this point I'm not sure if the box is gonna get to me in time for Christmas, since I'm flying home for about two weeks. It didn't get there in time, so I left instructions for one of my roommates to bring it inside at least and I'll worry about it later.

Well, I come back from Christmas and, shock! Still no service box! So I called Sony back (again, no wait time). The dude on the line was awesome. He was able to go through the history of the support ticket, and we figured out (read: guessed?) that boxes from Sony were mysteriously vanishing in FedEx fingers. Well, no harm no foul -- nothing of value was lost, as it were. So we sent a NEW box -- priority overnight.

Third time's the charm. I got a knock on the door the next morning, and a beautiful pre-paid cardboard cube, with easy instructions on how to pack everything up. Which I followed, until.... oh no! The instructions say I need a receipt -- but I don't have one, it was a gift. I check online -- it says I need to get in touch with the store, have them reprint it, mail it.... shit. Well, then I remember how easy it's been to call Sony, so I give them a ring. Once again, no holding at all. They tell me not to worry about it, they'll pull the purchase records based on the serial number and not to worry my pretty little head, it's all gonna be okay.

So I sent everything off on a Friday. Wouldn't you know it, I got an update by email when the PS4 arrived at Sony (Saturday). Expected turnaround time, it said, is 7-10 days -- so imagine my surprise when two days later, on Tuesday, I'm the proud new owner of a shiny new PS4.

Turned it on before I celebrated and -- shit! The controller won't pair with the system. Better check to see if there's a fix for that -- there is, it works great. And now everything is awesome. 

Overall experience: Super happy with Sony for their handling at every juncture. They were great on the phones, easy to contact, understanding. Less happy with FedEx, but what are you gonna do.",technology,1390509324

personalfinance,"For those of you who have been investment-minded since before you bought your first house, how did buying a house impact your plans/mindset? Did you feel like it was a setback in a way?","My grandfather, an investor himself, loves recounting the story of little 6-year-old me sitting on the front porch asking about why he doesn't have to work.  He taught me about stock splits and mutual funds and I ended up calling my parents in a huff because my savings account was getting a mere 3% (...would be a killing today!).  I told my dad I wanted my money in mutual funds so I could make more.

From then on I was pretty financially minded and have been investing every since.  I bought my first house around 1.5 years ago just after the bubble burst.  I got it for about 40-grand undermarket at a 2.75% 15-year loan and was thrilled about the timing, price, and interest rate.  When it's all said and done I'll only have paid about 20-40 grand in interest on the house, something I'm very grateful about.

But still...  While I understand that a house is ultimately a long-term investment and valuable asset, it's a bit of a bummer not being able to have the satisfaction of watching my brokerage portfolio grow like it used to.  While I love having a house now, in a lot of ways it was a necessary financial evil, because the alternative was dumping my money into the trash can renting.

Right now I'm a tad ""house poor"" since I'm spending my spare money getting it painted and furnishing it, and it's kind of a bummer not being able to put anything in my ROTH year to year and not really being able to buy any funds since it makes the most sense to pay off the house.  After it's furnished I'll be able to dump all of my spare money into paying off the house quickly... Hoping to pay it off in 10-13 years or faster if I'm fortunate.

I love my house but I've always seen a house as a financial ""road block"" of sorts.  Sure, it's equity, but even if I sell this one that money will just end up being tied up in another house.

25% of my $177,000 house is paid off and I've got about 40 grand in investments and no other debt.  I'm 27.  Am I ahead of the game?  Behind?  I want to retire young, but I can't help but feel I'm ""behind"" with my younger years being the most crucial years for investment and buying power of the dollar decreasing every year...",finance,1390510582

I've been sort of vaguely thinking of it as an emergency fund, and also that it'll go towards a down payment one day.

personalfinance,Income Deduction Question,"Hi guys,

I realize no one can give me perfect tax advice without knowing all my information, but I have a basic question regarding my income and some possible deductions.

Today I received my W2 and I was punching it into some tax forms to see what my refund will look like in April. The way my job works is that I get  paycheck for say $2k per month and from that I have my taxes deducted ($500) and rent automatically deducted ($500) giving me a net pay of $1000 per month. The taxes are all calculated on an income of $24k per year ($2k per month), but since my rent is taken out of my paycheck before its deposited I'm wondering if I can report my income as $18k per year ($1.5k per month).

My housing is through my employer, and they deduct it straight from my paycheck. On my pay stub it shows the deduction under ""other deductions"" that also include my fed/state/local taxes. On my W2, they have my full income ($24K), tax withheld ($6K) but no mention of my housing deduction. Technically I'm a grad student, if that changes anything. 

My basic question: can I somehow report ""net pay"" ($18K) as my gross income by way of some special deduction/credit/math or am I stuck just paying tax on the $24K?",finance,1390535563

personalfinance,Thoughts on maxing a 0% interest credit card to pay down a student loan?,"I am toying with this idea but it seems unconventional so I am wondering if there is a pitfall that I am not seeing. 

I have a new credit card with a 0% rate for 15 months. 

I also have a student loan for 10,000 at 6%ish interest. 

My plan is to max the card out the first month with normal expenses and bills ($1500 limit) and instead of paying it in full like I do normally I will just make a $100 payment each month and stop using the card for 15 months. 

I will then put the excess in my bank account to my student loan. 

I normally pay extra on the loan anyways but will take 100 out of that extra payment and use it for the 100 a month to pay the card in 15 months. 

This would essentially be free money right considering the lower interest. And more money from my normal payments would be toward principal too. 

The only downside I can see is risk that I somehow fall behind on the card and can't pay it off by the end of the 0 interest period. 

This can be mitigated by my good credit meaning that I can qualify for other 0 interest cards after 15 months. Of course there is a balance transfer fee but at 3% I still would have a lower interest rate on whatever the remainder of the balance is compared to the rate I would pay had I kept the money in the loan. 

Am I crazy?",finance,1390568804
dogecoin,"Walking On The Moon: As dogecoin gains millions of users, the organisations that receive donations must be proofed trustworthy.","The Jamaican bobsled team's financing was just the beginning. It has revealed the true potential of dogecoin as a medium for donating by making small micro payments. With dogecoin, it is easier to make very small payments without paying any transaction fee. That's part of the reasons why traditional money transfer businesses like Paypal and Western Union are biting their fingers.

Dogecoin eliminates the problem of decimals. Imagine tipping a cent using bitcoin. That's paying 0.000001 BTC. I hate calculating how many decimals I have to give . The decimals make payments feel very small, almost giving me a guilt trip. I don't feel the same way when I give 50 doges.

Because of the advantages of dogecoin and the vibrant shibe community that is demonstrating how to use dogecoin to tip, donating with dogecoin is bound to go mainstream. A culture that has been missing in our young generation is bound to get a comeback. Since the dogecoin subreddit is full of young people, tipping seems to be cool, and cool things attract other young folks.

Donating using doge has given it media attention. This is bound to continue if we keep up with the spirit of giving using dogecoin. Media attention will educate others about dogecoin and take dogecoin closer to mainstream adoption. Developers will make applications that enable people to tip or donate easily using doge. When large players like Coinbase or CoinMKT make it easier to buy doge using the dollar, many people will flock to buy dogecoins.

A byproduct of mainstream adoption is the increase in dogecoin's market cap as demand for dogecoin by those who wish to donate increases. We might also start witnessing political lobby groups and political campaigns begin receiving donations using dogecoin.
Now, we must begin critically thinking about the beneficiaries of our donations i.e the people or organisations that receive huge doge donations (note that I am not talking about tipping your friends or fellow shibes). I say this because if the Jamaican Bobsled Team funding project turned out to be a big fat lie, then all of us who donated would look like fools, and very few would participate in future projects. The giving culture would hit a low point and the value of dogecoin would go down the drain. Nobody wants to suffer engine failures midway to the moon.

The Wolves and Weasles series has exposed the selfish intents of lazy schemers. Soon you will start receiving emails of Nigerian princes asking for your help to withdraw some money, but this time asking for dogecoins. We also do not want to find ourselves in the unfortunate situation of funding criminal or even terrorist elements, something that would get us in trouble with governments, giving them more reasons to restrict crypto-currencies.

We must find a way of dealing with this problem early before haunts us in the future. To do this, I am proposing that there should be a few organisations that find very unique, awesome projects that are as cool as the Jamaican Bobsled Team funding project. An organisation should be selective on the projects they ask us to donate to, in other words they must choose projects that will get us talked about in the media and that will make us feel it was worth it.

The projects must be very few so that we can all be focused. Think of what would have happened if there were too many projects to be funded this week. The Jamaican bobsled team would not have been noticed. Also, most projects would not have reached their funding goals and the media would not have known what to report. One cool project at a time is perfect.

Finally these organisations need to get the backing or approval of trusted institutions within the shibe community, either the moderators of the dogecoin subreddit or the Dogecoin foundation. Apart from this subreddit, there should be an external site where these projects are announced. This will get us closer to the moon as people won't necessarily have to visit the subreddit every time a project is announced.

The site should be interactive, similar to whitehouse's we-the-people, where shibes will suggest or vote on projects that should be funded. But the organisation should have the final say on which of the top 10 projects suggested should be funded, and only one project at a time should get funded. The projects should not take a long time to get fulfilled.The site should also enable us to make us to make emergency donations like a tsunami that hits the West Coast, flooding California with man-eating-shark-infested salt water with Kim Kardshian's half-eaten torso flowing..........

Every person who wants to donate to an organisation should be advised to check if the said organisation is listed on dogecoin.com's website. In fact, if the Dogecoin foundation would take the initiative of organising these projects, it'd be much better, since it is trusted by the community. I don't want to donate to a water project in Africa with great excitement, only to later learn that the person behind the project was spotted hanging around with hot babes clad in tight bikinis on a yatch that was bought with my doges.

Finally, new shibes need to be taught how to see through the deceptions of unscrupulous conmen and those who are caught should be exposed, shamed and punished. The integrity of dogecoin must be protected. All these precautions are necessary for a growing community like us. If taken, then by the dogecoin goes mainstream (you can be sure it will) the world will be learning from us.",cryptocurrency,1390573827

personalfinance,Student Credit Card?,"I'm 21 and in Massachusetts. I'm looking at [these](http://www.creditcards.com/college-students.php) but I trust you all more than this website...

I'm a student at a university that offers a coop program, so I generally work 6-8mo out of the year. I tried to apply for a credit card through my bank (DCU), but they won't give me one without a cosigner, which I'd rather not have to do.

Are there any good choices for credit cards for students that don't require a cosigner? I don't intend on carrying a balance on this card, so interest rate isn't really a concern. It also seems like it'll be rather difficult to find one (most applications aren't super clear on this given my weird employment status?), so while obviously good rewards would be .. good.. this is more for building credit than anything else. I'm guessing I'll have to go with a straight up ""student"" card, but again, the whole cosigner thing. Does this even exist?

Thanks!",finance,1390585310

personalfinance,Curiosity: What's the lowest non-promotional standard purchase APR you have on a Credit Card?,"Regular bank cards only please (Visa, MC, AmEx, Discover), no store cards.  Also, no special gimmicks / promotions (aka 12 months at 0%, or 0% on BTs, etc...) - we're talking the current standard purchase interest rate / APR.  Also, ***I get that we're not carrying balances (or not supposed to be), so ""0% because I pay it off every month"" isn't really a thing.***  Call it an informal study on the best you could do if you did *have to* carry a balance.

personalfinance,Paying off undergrad loans VS paying for grad school in full?,"Hi PF! I've been lurking around here for a while and would like your opinion on my situation.



**Background:**


I'm 24, and plan on beginning a 4yr part-time masters program in social work in the fall. Haven't officially been accepted yet, but the school I plan on attending will cost about $33k (I'll round to $35k because tuition will probably increase slightly every year). I should note that I am doing this program part-time because I need to continue working full-time to support myself. My salary is about $49,500.00/yr.



**Current debt:**


I currently have about $20k in undergraduate loans. All federal, and interest rates range from 4-6%. My monthly payment is just shy of $300/mo. My only other debt I have is about $5k which I owe to my grandparents who financed a car for me during undergrad. They are not charging interest and are flexible on the payment plan. I've been paying $400/mo to pay them back as soon as possible (originally owed them about $18k). This should only take another year to pay off.



**Finances:**


I have about $20k between my checking &amp; savings account. I also have a pension through my work that I put money in (about 6% of my salary), but would like to open my own Roth IRA in the near-ish future. I won't go into the boring details of my budget, as I'd really just like your opinion on financing graduate school. If it matters, let me know and I'll edit this post.



**Options:**


**1)** My plan is to keep the $20k in the bank, continue paying my undergrad loans, and pay for graduate school in full every semester. This should definitely be manageable, as it is 8 payments over the course of 4 years (about $3500-4000 each semester).

**2)** Pay off undergrad loans in full and take out loans for graduate school. This option makes me feel a little uncomfortable because I will be graduating in 4 years with about $35k in debt. My monthly payments would be more than the $300/mo I am used to with my undergrad loans (assuming the interest rates are similar).



Anyway, I was wondering if you all had any thoughts or suggestions on my options? Or if you have a suggestion I haven't thought of yet? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if you'd like any more details and I'll be happy to edit the post.

personalfinance,What are your thoughts for debt consolidation companies/processes?,"I am helping somebody with 30k in credit card debt (along with 3k/month in other loan debts, a mortgage and car).  This is a unique situation from others that I've helped in that she has a decent credit score, around 720, and has not had a credit check done from another company in over a year.  Also, she is able to afford all her debts and at face value, appears to have a bit of a snowball to work with although I'm still digging through her expenses.  
  
The rough breakdown of debt and interest rates are as follows:  
Card 1: $6,300 350/month fixed (account closed) 15.99% APR  
Card 2: $9,800 6.74% APR  
Card 3: $3,000 0% APR  
Card 4: $1,500 14.74% APR  
Card 5: $5,000 15.24% APR  
Card 6: $4,600 18.99% APR  
  
Since there are so many high interest rate/high balance cards, it seems a better idea to buy into a debt consolidation service.  Problem is I have no idea if any of them are actually legitimate, and if it's a good idea.  It seems like a good idea, if she could get approved for a loan for say 5-6% for the balance of any of the cards over 10% interest rate, but there may be things I am missing.  
  
I'm looking for any suggestions for services, or ideas in general.  Her total credit limits are approx. 60k, but the open credit is on all the wrong cards.

personalfinance,"Student Loan Dept over $145,000 and no job good enough to pay, need advice","I had to leave college back in May 2012 because of financial burdens, and with no help from family or previous savings borrowed about $120,000 to pay for my years in college. After interest that amount is now roughly $145,000.  The great majority of the loans were unsubsidized private student loans taken through company's like Discover, Chase, and PNC because I could not get enough government aid because my cosigner made so little money and I had to try and finish school.  Only about $14,000 was fixed rate government loans.  Taking student loans from these private companys was rather easy and it seemed like my only option when paying for school. Its been over a year now and I have not been able to secure a job that pays anywhere near enough to afford my monthly payments; about $1,900 a month! Regardless of throwing everything I can afford into these loans, they are beginning to default and I've been told that these private student loans can't be consolidated with government ones. I don't know what I can do and need advice.
TLDR pay $1,900 a month for student loans ($145,000 total) and have just over a minimum wage job, simply can't afford. HELP

EDIT: I went to a State School, paid out of state tuition. With living expenses it was about $39,000 a year. I studied Biology, with a focus in wildlife and ecology research. I have not found a job biology related or anything high paying regardless of applying for many many jobs and trying to network with any family friends etc. that I can. I'm not limiting my job search to only biology or lab related work, it's just where my experience lies. I work at two restaurants currently but can't make these $1900 payments, let alone save any money. The interest rates of the private loans range from 7.5 to 10.25% and account for about $130,000 of the debt. I live at home and my parent was a cosigner who makes only $32,000, and can provide me no assistance. My parents didn't go to college and they more or less assumed if finish school on time, get a great job and be able to pay this. Them, and my 18 year old self, didn't understand how high these payments would end up. I just figured I was a poor college student like many friends of mine.

dogecoin,Dogecoin has put a smile on my face for the first time in months.,"^TLDR: ^/r/dogecoin ^rocks!

I don't normally publicly discuss my problems, but this time I'll make an exception. For a variety of reasons I won't go into, I've been dealing with major depression for over a year now. Before I was diagnosed, I wouldn't have gotten out of bed at all if it weren't for my dog. After getting treatment, I've slowly improved to the point where I am at least semi-functioning, but I still don't feel like my ""normal"" self, and certainly haven't felt motivated or *happy*. It's as if my inner fire had been snuffed out.

I discovered /r/dogecoin about two weeks ago after reading about the Grinch who Stole Dogemas. Seeing the community raising massive amounts of dogecoin to ""Save Dogemas"" really struck me, and I had to find out more about this new (and ostensibly absurd) cryptocurrency.

Clicking through the links and comments, I found myself grinning ear to ear, but not for the usually reason. As impressive the passion of this community is, and as funny as the memes and photoshops may be, I was genuinely astonished at the affability and sense of togetherness that pervade this entire subreddit. It's so, so rare to see such consistently uncynical, *friendly* behavior these days, especially on Reddit. It drove me to learn more and within a day I had started mining for the first time.

Since then, I'm proud to say I've mined almost 30,000 doge. I've gotten involved in this community, both on reddit and IRC. I have ""dogecoin"" added to my google news feed. I check [dogecharts.org](http://dogecharts.org) and [cryptmarketcap.com](http://cryptmarketcap.com) all too frequently and root for the rise of doge. Most importantly, though, this new interest has had a positive impact on my outlook and overall sense of well-being. I've felt more motivated this week than I have in months, and got my first A on an exam since the start of the academic year. I'm cautiously optimistic about the future, but you can bet your ass I'm going to enjoy this while it lasts.

Thank you, /r/dogecoin, sincerely.",cryptocurrency,1390596017
dogecoin,If you really want to launch dogecoin to the moon get snoop doge on board and start a fundraiser for the legalization of cannabis! The tide is turning and dogecoin can help!,"just think about it, the end of cannabis prohibition is near.

the states will fall like dominos lured by that sweet tax cash, the politicians will very carefully pull a 180 or die out and the feds will follow eventually.

2014 could be the year, or maybe 2015 or 2016 but ""soon"" it will happen ;)

And Dogecoin can help speed this process up. i would love to be able to donate to norml for example with dogecoin. just donating normally is pretty good, but a fundraiser is just so much cooler cause you contribute a small amount to something larger and through that partcipate in in the dogecoin community.

so i suggest we start a dogecoin fundraiser to end cannabis prohibition and get snoop doge on board for some extra rocketfuel.

Fundraiser + snoop doge + new shibes from /r/trees + legal cannabis sales with doge ;) = MOON!

* $1700 in Gold and Silver bullion. (Can easily liquidate, but I want this to be long term hedge for if the economy collapses.)




I work part time job on the weekend that pays anywhere from $100-300 per pay cycle depending on hours. I go to school but I live in GA, USA where the Hope Scholarship + Federal Pell Grant pays for pretty much whole tuition. This semester the costs were about $4200 and I received about $5400 so I ended up with more money. This is probably temporary because the Pell Grant is based on student/parent income  and I started working AFTER I applied for FAFSA. But I should still end up with no debt when I graduate ~2 years from now.

My expenses include 

* paying for gas for my long commute to school ($40/week)  
* textbooks (couple hundred/semester).

I live at home. I am very frugal; never spend any money. Zero socializing, zero friends. :(




**Anyways** I want to buy a motorcycle because I'm young and I'm dumb and it would give me a reason to see some sunlight and have some joy.

personalfinance,"$95k in student loans, but high income. Need help with pay-off order. Also, keep living at home - or move out? (Life experience questions... A little long)","Hey guys,

I'm a 27 year old currently riding with about $94k in student loan debt (brought it down from about $120k). I also have a car with roughly $12k left. I currently live at home, and reaching the end of my 20s, I want to figure out a way to manage my finances so I can move out and get that life experience before I end up settling down (or if it's even worth it).

Luckily, the debt pushed me to work my ass off and I've achieved a fair amount of success. 

I figure I'd start by listing out my monthly income and expenses:

* LOAN 1 - $4,742. $56.39/month. 11% interest
* LOAN 2 - $4,436.23. $75.81/month. 11% interest
* LOAN 3 - $7,765.37. $65.02/month. 4.75% interest
* LOAN 4 - $8,534.59. $102.39/month. 5.5% interest - CONSOLIDATED
* LOAN 5 - $10,568.86. $91.20/month. 5.25% interest
* LOAN 6 - $11,043.15. $95.29/month. 5.25% interest
* LOAN 7 - $18,810.54. $162.32/month. 5.25% interest
* LOAN 8 - $28,927.74. $370.03/month. 6% interest (CONSOLIDATED)

**TOTAL** - $94,883.65. $1018.46/month

CAR - $12,500. $385/month 2% interest/APR

**TOTAL** - $1403.46/month

**MY THOUGHTS** 

Currently, I'm in a contractor position that will move to perm in 6 months. That being said, my rate is hourly, and putting in overtime, I'm bringing in around $5,000 a month after taxes.

Since a move to perm will shift my income to salary, I'll be bringing home a raw figure of around $3800 or so after taxes.

In the meantime, I want to use the contracting salary to it's full advantage. Here is what I currently plan to do:

**6 MONTH PLAN:**

Pay off Loans 1 &amp; 2 due to their very high interest rates.

Pay off my car next - due to the highest money saved per month in the shortest time possible. 

Redirect that money from 1, 2, and car (which is around $520 a month) to kill off LOAN 4 (due to high minimum monthly payment).

**LONG TERM PLAN**

Once I do that, I'm not sure what loan I should tackle next... Should I begin whittling down LOAN 8? It's the highest interest, but also the highest loan - meaning I wont see a monthly reduction in a very long time.

Now... 

**LIFE EXPERIENCE**

I fear that I'll hit say 30 or so, have most (if not all) of my loans paid off, but then go like ""... now what? There goes my 20s living as a hermit to pay these things off"". 

I am very social and see friends regularly, but is living the 20s in the city (I do indulge in the bar/night club/party/pick-up culture in limited amounts atm, but I want to expand on that) really worth the $600-$1000+ I'd be adding to my monthly expenses with rent/utilities/etc?",finance,1390599916

I was lucky enough to buy at the bottom of the market and my house is now valued such that I could avoid PMI in a refinance.  The flip side is that interest rates have risen from 4.25% to 4.5%.  I've done the math, and over the course of the loan I'd pay 30k more interest under the refi than I would if I just stuck with the original.  But, I'd also pay $260 less a month.  I tempted to still do it because I would invest some portion of the savings.  So, for example, if I took just $50/mo of the savings and got just a 5% return, I'd end up with 40k over 30 years.

solar,I'm building an extension on the house next year and want to install solar panels the next year.,"I have an all electric home in SW Ohio that I would like to take solar in the next couple years. I believe the federal solar tax rebate is set to expire at the end of 2016, so my plan is to do my install that year. I would like a system capable of supplying at least 1/2 of my energy needs. I dream of going off-grid for energy, but not sure how practical that really is. 

In the mean time, while I plot and dream of solar, I've been in the process of making my home more energy efficient. Since I bought the house in 2003, I've reduced my annual energy consumption by almost 1/3. As I stated above, the house is all electric, heated with an electric heat pump. Improvements included new windows, new HVAC, foam insulation, LED lighting, efficient pool pump, heat pump water heater, and a few efficient appliances. I have a few more efficiency projects left to do, but I'm mostly down to insulation improvements. All work, including the HVAC installation was done by myself with the help of friends.

Here are a few notes/ideas for my future solar installation:

    The installation will happen after my kitchen extension project next year. This gives me a section of south facing roof large enough for 10 300 Watt panels. I would like to have an additional 10-20 panels on the west sloping part of the roof.  

    I'm considering doing the installation, or at least part of the installation myself. I'm pretty handy and am interested in a quicker payoff period for the system. I am pretty good at CAD and can draft a set of plans for permitting. I would, at a minimum, hire an electrician to make the electrical connections.

    I would like to install an inverter capable of charging a bank of batteries, rather than purely relying on net-metering to pay me for my excess energy generation. I may not install the batteries for this first phase, but I would like to keep that option open in the event of a massive battery technology/manufacturing price breakthrough. 

    I'll be in the market for a new car in 4 or 5 years and I'm pretty sure it will be an electric car. When planning my solar system I want to take into consideration charging the car with my panels either directly, or through a battery buffer.",energy,1390603650

personalfinance,Should we layer life/disability insurance on top of employer-provided plans?,"I went to a financial planning seminar and I heard this advice for high-salaried engineers: buy separate insurance policies and layer them with your work insurance benefits because:

* When you switch jobs you can't take employer plan with you
* Many employers are cancelling/reducing benefits even after people have contributed to those plans for decades

I thought it was interesting advice... what do you think?",finance,1390607722
personalfinance,Buying home vs Investing &amp; Renting forever,"Hi PFers,

So for most of my life I've wanted to own a home at some point, but lately I've been considering simply renting for the rest of my life, and investing the down payment I would have made. I ran some calculations in Excel and it seems like investing the money in the long run would yield a significant amount of returns. 

I was hoping to get your feedback to maybe see if I'm missing some benefit of home ownership. I used a mortgage calculator to generate the following:

House Value: $600,000

Loan Amount: $400,000 (I wouldn't put down any less than 30%)

Interest rate: 5% (though I suspect this would be lower since my credit is very good)

Property Tax: 1.25%, PMI: 0.5%

Monthly Payment (30 years): $2772.29

After 30 years, my total payments would be $998,000 to own the home.

Alternatively, I could invest the $200,000 down payment and rent a place at $3,000 per month, which would afford me a home of similar size. I assumed a post inflation interest rate of 5% and that my rent would increase by 5% per year.

At that rate, it would take about 7 years before my investment is generating enough income (post capital gains tax) to cover my rent and then some. And of course by year 30, my investment would have made significant gains. 

It seems that investing and renting a home is the far superior option if I'm looking to maximize the money in my accounts. 

So PF, what do you think? Am I missing some major benefit to owning a home that would justify hundreds of thousands of dollars lost?",finance,1390613930
dogecoin,"shibes, men, and women of dogecoin,","I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for doge in the history of our coin.

1ish months ago ago, a great Shibe, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, created dogecoin. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Shibe coiners who had missed out on numerous other coins. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their grief.

But one month later, the Shibe still is not at the moon. One month later, the life of the Shibe is still sadly crippled by the manacles of other coins and the chains of bitcoin. One month later, the Shibe lives on a lonely island of rocketship building in the midst of a vast ocean of other coins. One month later, the Shibe is still laughed at by other Cyrptocurrencies and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. Of Dogecoin.  When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Wowsitution and the Declaration of Doge, they were signing a promissory note to which every Shibe was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all coins, yes, dogecoin as well as bitcoin, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Coin, Moon, and the pursuit of Doge"" It is obvious today that cyrptocurrencies have defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as the citizens of Doge are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, cyrptocurrencies has given the Shibe people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""wow. nomoon4u.""

But we refuse to believe that the bank of wow and moon is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are NO MOONS LEFT in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of flight and the moon.

We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind cyrptocurrencies of the fierce urgency of Wow. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of bitcoin. Now is the time to make real the launch to the moon. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of on the ground to the sunlit path of a moon orbit. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of no shibes on moon, to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of Doge's children.

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Doge's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Twentry Fourteen is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Doge needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in cyrptocurrencies until the Doge is granted his rocketship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of the moon emerges. Or the dark side. Both work!

But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of hating other cyrptocurrencies. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into cyber violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.

The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Doge community must not lead us to a distrust of all Cryptocurrencies, for many of our Cryptocurrency brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.

We cannot fly alone.

And as we fly, we must make the pledge that we shall always fly to the moon.

We cannot turn back.

There are those who are asking the devotees of coin rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Doge is the victim of the being blocked from the moon. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of flight, cannot gain from only Earth orbit. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Doge's basic mobility is from an orbit to another. We can never be satisfied as long as our coins are laughed at and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: ""We accept Bitcoin."" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Doge in /r/bitcoin cannot be taken seriously and a Doge in /r/litecoin believes he cannot be on the sidebar. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until we reach the moon.

I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow 5 kh/s. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for 13371377217327 kh/s left you laughed at by the coins of better vaule and staggered by the coins of rudeness. You have been the veterans of mining. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to /r/bitcoin, go back to /r/cryptocurrency, go back to /r/someothercoin , go back to /r/litecoin, go back to /r/notacoingoingtothemoon, go back to the slums and orbit of our planent, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.

Let us not wallow in the valley of anti-rockets, I say to you today, my friends.

And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Dogecoin Dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all coins are not as good as dogecoin.""

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of /r/bitcoin, the sons of current dogecoin owners and the sons of former bitcoin owners will be able to sit down together at the moon.

I have a dream that one day even the state of /r/litecoin, a state sweltering with the heat of no rockets, sweltering with the heat of only orbits, will be transformed into an oasis of moon and dogecoin.

I have a dream that my 10 doge will one day be worth more than everything else, and not be judged by its dogeness, but by it's vaule.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in /r/bitcoin, with its vicious coinists, with its moderators having their lips dripping with the words of ""stupid"" and ""silly""  -- one day right there in /r/bitcoin little boy shibes and shibe girls will be able to join paws with little boy bitcoiners and bitcoin girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together, so we can fly to the moon.

This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to /r/bitcoin with.


With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of laughter a stone of vaule. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of dogecoin. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to mine together, to stand up for khs together, knowing that we will get a block one day.

And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of Doge's children will be able to sing with new meaning:

    My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of doge, of thee I sing.

    Land where my doge's died, land of the Shibe's pride,

    From every mountainside, let Dogecoin ring!

And if Cryptocurrencies are going to work, this must become true.

And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of /r/litecoin

    Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of /r/bitcoin.

    Let freedom ring from the heightening Shibehenies of /r/nowitsdogecoin.

    Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Dogies of /r/someothercoin.

    Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of /r/dogecoinonetruelord.

But not only that:

    Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of /r/bitcoin.

    Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of /r/litecoin.

    Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of /r/bitlitebitcoin.

    From every mountainside, let coins ring.

And when this happens, and when we allow coins to ring, when we let it ring from every desktop and every laptop, from every coin, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, Shibe men and Bitcoin men, Litecoiners and Shibes, Shibes and more Shibes, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Doge spiritual:

                A block at last! A block at last!

                Thank God Almighty, we got a block at last!

personalfinance,"xpost from r/tax, please help","in r/tax: http://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1w3541/married_by_living_in_different_states_both_have/

My spouse had income in NJ (7 months) and VA (5 months), and I had income in CT (9 months) and VA (3 months). We have lived in separate households all through the year. My child was living with me for 3 months and her for 9 months. Our W2s combined threw us out of the limit for claiming child care credit.

I went through tons of tax advise websites and they all seem to say I can't file as single unless I am divorced or separated through court order. What would be the best method to maximise my returns?

Turbotax suggest married filing joint, and I don't know enough to override that suggestion. Is there even a better option than what Turbotax suggests?

update:
I recalculated using turbotax - married filing separate for my wife &amp; me, didn't include my son in my return.

The total return this method was $2350, I owed tax in CT and both of us got refunds in VA &amp; NJ.

I calculated married filing jointly, the return was $2100, we owed tax in NJ, offset by the return from VA.

The main reason why I wanted to file separate was that we lost our child credit $1000 this time. My wife made less than what is needed to get the credit, but if you look at my calculations, the difference wasn't much!

I included the filing charges  - 2 federal and 4 state returns vs 1 federal and 3 state returns - the difference was even less.

I will recalculate again in a few days, when my mind is not clouded and I get all my 1099-INT statements from the banks.",finance,1390618272

dogecoin,"Walking On The Moon: As dogecoin gains millions of users, organisations that receive donations must be proofed trustworthy","The Jamaican bobsled team's funding was just the beginning. It has revealed the true potential of dogecoin as a medium for donating by making small micro payments. With dogecoin, it is easier to make very small payments without paying any transaction fee. That's part of the reasons why traditional money transfer businesses like Paypal and Western Union are biting their fingers.

Dogecoin eliminates the problem of decimals. Imagine tipping a cent using bitcoin. That's paying 0.000001 BTC. I hate calculating how many decimals I have to give . The decimals make payments feel very small, almost giving me a guilt trip. I don't feel the same way when I give 50 doges.

Because of the advantages of dogecoin and the vibrant shibe community that is demonstrating how to use dogecoin to tip, donating with dogecoin is bound to go mainstream. A culture that has been missing in our young generation is bound to get a comeback. Since the dogecoin subreddit is full of young people, tipping seems to be cool, and cool things attract other young folks.

Donating using doge has given it media attention. This is bound to continue if we keep up with the spirit of giving using dogecoin. Media attention will educate others about dogecoin and take dogecoin closer to mainstream adoption. Developers will make applications that enable people to tip or donate easily using doge. When large players like Coinbase or CoinMKT make it easier to buy doge using the dollar, many people will flock to buy dogecoins.

A byproduct of mainstream adoption is the increase in dogecoin's market cap as demand for dogecoin by those who wish to donate increases. We might also start witnessing political lobby groups and political campaigns begin receiving donations using dogecoin. Now, we must begin critically thinking about the beneficiaries of our donations i.e the people or organisations that receive huge doge donations (note that I am not talking about tipping your friends or fellow shibes). I say this because if the Jamaican Bobsled Team funding project turned out to be a big fat lie, then all of us who donated would look like fools, and very few would participate in future projects. The giving culture would hit a low point and the value of dogecoin would go down the drain. Nobody wants to suffer engine failures midway to the moon.

The Wolves and Weasles series has exposed the selfish intents of lazy schemers. Soon you will start receiving emails of Nigerian princes asking for your help to withdraw some money, but this time asking for dogecoins. We also do not want to find ourselves in the unfortunate situation of funding criminal or even terrorist elements, something that would get us in trouble with governments, giving them more reasons to restrict crypto-currencies.

We must find a way of dealing with this problem early before haunts us in the future. To do this, I am proposing that there should be a few organisations that find very unique, awesome projects that are as cool as the Jamaican Bobsled Team funding project. An organisation should be selective on the projects they ask us to donate to, in other words they must choose projects that will get us talked about in the media and that will make us feel it was worth it.

The projects must be very few so that we can all be focused. Think of what would have happened if there were too many projects to be funded this week. The Jamaican bobsled team would not have been noticed. Also, most projects would not have reached their funding goals and the media would not have known what to report. One cool project at a time is perfect.

Finally these organisations need to get the backing or approval of trusted institutions within the shibe community, either the moderators of the dogecoin subreddit or the Dogecoin foundation. Apart from this subreddit, there should be an external site where these projects are announced. This will get us closer to the moon as people won't necessarily have to visit the subreddit every time a project is announced.

The site should be interactive, similar to whitehouse's we-the-people, where shibes will suggest or vote on projects that should be funded. But the organisation should have the final say on which of the top 10 projects suggested should be funded, and only one project at a time should get funded. The projects should not take a long time to get fulfilled.The site should also enable us to make us to make emergency donations like a tsunami that hits the West Coast, flooding California with man-eating-shark-infested salt water with Kim Kardshian's half-eaten torso flowing..........

Every person who wants to donate to an organisation should be advised to check if the said organisation is listed on dogecoin.com's website. In fact, if the Dogecoin foundation would take the initiative of organising these projects, it'd be much better, since it is trusted by the community. I don't want to donate to a water project in Africa with great excitement, only to later learn that the person behind the project was spotted hanging around with hot babes clad in tight bikinis on a yatch that was bought with my doges.

Finally, new shibes need to be taught how to see through the deceptions of unscrupulous conmen and those who are caught should be exposed, shamed and punished. The integrity of dogecoin must be protected. All these precautions are necessary for a growing community like us. If taken, then by the dogecoin goes mainstream (you can be sure it will) the world will be learning from us.",cryptocurrency,1390637292

electronics,Trying to troubleshooting a mixing console.,"I've got an inline mixing console from Alesis that is pretty old that I'm trying to return to service. It's currently acting pretty wonky and I was hoping someone could get me pointed in the right direction.

A while back when I had first brought it back out of storage when I turned it on it would spaz and the LED's would all begin to flicker and it would output a loud buzz. I found it's service manual online and checked out the schems and decided that the powersupply would be my best bet for repair. I replaced a few of the caps and it worked correctly for a bit when I got it back together. The next day I had the same issue though. I kept messing around with different things in the PSU and eventually decided that with it's age, it might be best to get a new PSU going for it.

I purchased a kit from JLM audio to provide me with +48v, +/-15v, and +5v lines and swapped out the supplies. I kept the transformer as it already is supplying the 18v I needed to power my new PSU. After building it and testing the voltages I mounted it into my case and reconnected the consoles lines. Powered up great, but as I was testing different sections, the problem returned.

Disappointed, I started timing the time until onset. After letting the board sit for a bit it initially took 25 seconds, and then with repeated power cycles it only took about 7 seconds to start.

The service manual mentions this sort of thing in the beginning, but I'm pretty new to all of this and can't exactly determine how to heed it's advice.

&gt; A Quick Note Regarding Short/Loaded D.C. Power Supply Lines in the Studio 32

&gt; The STUDIO 32 main P.C.B. is quite densely packed. This inhibits the implementation of standard troubleshooting techniques. Described herein is a time efficient technique for locating D.C. shorted capacitors.

&gt; Operational symptoms may include: 

&gt; No power up.

&gt; All L.E.D.’s are dim or pulsing, but +48 v phantom will operate correctly if enabled.

&gt; Solution:

&gt; Remove D.C. power cables the main P.C.B. and the rear panel P.C.B.
Apply a high current (5A) low voltage (less than 25V) to the shorted supply line. This will usually cause the capacitor to fuse open.

&gt; The mixer should function normally, but a full Q.C. test must be performed to rule out latent damage.

I would really like to get this board running and to learn a bit about troubleshooting electronics doing it. I don't really consider it a worthy investment to be repaired by someone else, so I won't be taking it to a shop to get looked at.

I assume that my new powersupply can provide me the necessary current and voltage to fuse open whatever cap is goofed. I have the 6A version of [this](http://www.jlmaudio.com/shop/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=12) unit and I built it and tested and it is providing the correct supplies. How do I go about checking for a shorted cap?

personalfinance,Options to refinance Mortgage with no/minimal closing cost?,"I have a 30 year fixed rate mortgage with Chase at 6.25%, opened in 2008.  I divorced July of last year (this becomes important for the next paragraph), want to refinance as there are much better rates available, but can't afford any closing costs because of divorce-debt.

About 8 months ago, Chase called to offer a refinance down to 4.25% with NO closing costs (other than requiring the upcoming mortgage payment at closing).  They explained that after 5 years, people begin to look to refinance and this is there way of retaining customers.  I had just finalized my divorce and was in the process of getting my ex-wife off of the deed.  I filled out all of the paperwork with Chase and we were ready to go, but it took forever to get my ex-wife off of the deed (slow lawyers, vindictive ex).  Chase had to cancel the offer because rates were about to change and it was taking too long to get the deed changed.

I now have the deed and am wondering if anyone else knows of similar offers (no/minimal closing costs) to refinance with a reputable company.  I really want to refinance to a  lower interest rate, but I have almost no money to pay closing costs because of my divorce.

solar,Solar practicality in GA,"I've become interested in solar for the house. I filled out a calculator (can't remember which website it was), and after rebates the system it was recommending would pay for itself in about 5 years. The system would cover 50% of my use, based on the monthly dollar amount that I told the calculator. 

I'm in Georgia, and from what I can tell I would get federal and state rebates, plus the sellback to Georgia Power. 

I'm not sure about PACE financing since the thing I looked at for that wasn't clear to me if it was available in Georgia. PACE would be a great option for me, if it's available. 

One question that I have is that I've heard that the manufacturing of solar panels uses an incredible amount of energy, and that it takes a very long time for the panels to offset that. Is this still true, or has the manufacturing process become more energy efficient? 

A couple other things I'm curious about:

SolarCity isn't available in Georgia, but I'm not sure I would want that kind of deal anyway. I would want to own my panels. How does one go about choosing a company to sell you equipment? 

I would like panels that are made in USA. Is that feasible, or are they all coming from China these days? 

Do most on-grid systems have batteries? I imagine they aren't necessary. 

How do panels hold up to hail? Are they typically covered by insurance? 

Does having panels on the roof help with attic temperatures? Seems like it would create some shade on the roof and decrease the temperature in the attic in the summer.

America has fallen from first for average wealth in the early 1980's to 17th today. America is still falling in the tables of average wealth (despite the large increase in the number of billionaires).

Despite those pushing the Corporatist agenda having all the money, power and mainstream Corporate controlled media, public outrage over disastrous government policies can still make a difference.

The big banks do not need need any more free money. They already have over $1.7tn of ""excess reserves"". The banks could lend out another $17tn tomorrow, but nobody wants to borrow it - even at current low interest rates. 

The only lending that is really increasing is student loan debts. Student loan debt is now over $1tn - more than sub-prime mortgages in the run up to 2007. 

There is also an increase in subsidized auto loans. But nothing else.

So I was reading through the help sheet? instructions? that came with my Bank of America credit card and in the useful tips section, it mentions this:

If you can pay more than the monthly minimum payment, the extra amount is applied to your balance with the highest interest rate, so you can pay off your balance faster and save on interest. 

Can someone explain, in layman terms what this means?? So let's say I have a minimum payment of $25 due, and my balance to pay is $400. Saying I pay, $40, are they saying they are going to charge the highest interest rate on $15 I paid over the minimum payment? How will having a high interest rate on that $15 help me pay off my balance faster? Lol

This is my annual review of my portfolio and I am trying to scale down to a preferred asset allocation.  The problem is that I have too many positions and it is making it complicated on how to re-position it.

The total return (return+div) of the accounts for last year were:

* Traditional IRA: [40.27%](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=8DDDE01AC2383407!2572&amp;authkey=!ACJs3WGz9VeI3bU&amp;v=3&amp;ithint=photo%2c.jpg)

Originally, when I rolled over my 401k into this trading account, I just diversified into all different sectors with best of breed companies.  I looked for increasing book values and sales over the past 5-10 years.

Here is a link to my portfolio:

* **[My Retirement Portfolio](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=8DDDE01AC2383407!2566&amp;authkey=!AJhGsoGM2kuw_Co&amp;ithint=file%2c.xlsx)**

I would prefer to sell off about 1/2 of the large cap securities to lower market caps and get into: JNJ/ECL/FAST/XOM.  

The asset allocation I would prefer to move towards would be:


* Large Cap - 50%
* Mid Cap - 5%
* Small Cap - 5%
* Foreign - 10%
* REITs - 10%
* Bonds - 20%
* Commodities - 0%
* Cash - 0% (Or mixed with Bonds)


**CORE HOLDINGS:**
I do not want to sell 3M/Wells Fargo/Google/Coke/Disney/Union Pacific.


**Roth IRA**
I am going to be selling everything but Chipolte (already sold half as it was up over 100%) and FKINX.  I am swing trading the other stocks to get them positive and then sell.


Franklin Income Fund (FKINX) is a hybrid mutual fund that I am using as the bond equivalent as when I invested originally it was 90% bond / 10% equity.  They have moved the allocation to 50/50 but will move back as interest rates normalize.  They pay dividends every month that compound on each other with a typical annual yield of 5-7%. Once the sell off happens I will move this up to 20% of the portfolio.


The highlighted cells are the cuts I am thinking about doing. I need to cut a lot more.  Even though cutting a lot of positions I would still prefer to stay sector diversified.  So if we are cutting a solid holding like P&amp;G I would prefer a smaller cap company in the consumer goods sector.

So Reddit, please help determine what to sell and get this portfolio to my targeted asset allocation.  Any critiques or questions are welcomed.

**TLDR** Too many positions in Large Caps, help me scale down the portfolio with cuts.

So I did most of my taxes last night and found out that I'll have a federal tax bill of over 1000 bucks. I'll likely have a state tax bill too (VA), but didn't actually get that far. To avoid this I'm thinking of converting some of my wife and I's roth IRA to a traditional IRA. I'd have to convert about 6500 dollars to avoid the federal tax bill. 

Here's some basics on us:

1. Our gross income this year was 78k. We will likely retire on less.
2. We rent and have no kids, so our only deduction was $2500 dollars in student loan interest. 
3. I have a good emergency fund built up so I'm comfortable with the money being in the traditional IRA until I'm 59.5. 
4. Married filing jointly

I'd like to know what your thoughts are on doing this conversion. Provided I go forward with this I'd also like your advice on how to do the conversion. The roth IRA is currently invested in index funds, so do I need to sell them, open a traditional IRA, deposit the money, and re-buy the stocks?

He spilled the beans and said look, we are going into a currency crisis. Major banks are going to default in the next 3 weeks. The stock markets are going to go in a violent downward trend not only here but all around the world. The currencies of the world are going to move in every direction and there's no predicting which ones will still be standing after this is all over. It will spill into the bond markets here and it will be interesting to see what the fed will do. He warned whatever the fed did it was not going to help and not solve any problem. When I asked who told him this. My boss said he talked to a buddy of his who happens to be an executive in JP Morgan. I asked what triggers it and he said the Chinese trust default is going to cause a domino effect which will spill into every market and every currency in the world. He also said this coming week from the 27th to the 31st will have volatile trading and that this collapse is imminent within the next 3 weeks.

My boyfriend and I have been cohabiting together for six months and are entering new, unknown financial territory. It's a forever relationship but we're not married secondary to logistical reasons and not engaged because 2 year engagements should be called what they are-dating. He's active duty army. I have spent this past fall finishing (unpaid) clinical rotations, so we have subsisted entirely on his income. We are now at the end of the tunnel and blinded by the light. He just got promoted and I will be starting a PAID job in the next month. 

Quick finance rundown: 
Him: just increased to 4400/mo with another pay significant raise coming in July.
Me: 2200/mo. 
Bills: ~3000/mo (don't go there, find another budget to pick at!)

My Debt: Amount is significant but none of your business and not something I'm really anxious about because of our situation. I had planned to put 1000/mo towards them starting in June with intentions of increasing that amount as we are able to (e.g. once we have a good nest egg going or as pay raises come along)

MATH: 4400 + 2200 = 6600 - 3000 - 1000 = $2600/mo left over

As far as our biology degreed brains have gotten us, we feel that the safest bet is to continue to live off of his paycheck while saving mine in a joint savings plus whatever he has left (or saving mine and letting him learn more about investing with his leftovers). Once we get a good nest egg going we'd re-evaluate and look into (cough learn about) more investing. He already has a Roth IRA. This seems like the best option because there will come a time in 2-3 years we we have to move and my income will be in flux so we essentially always need to be able to make it on what he makes.

Also it's been mentioned to me that my debt repayment plan could be better through money markets or conservative investments that pay out more than my interest rate (specifically only paying 500/mo to my debt and 500 into an account that will accrue more than 5% interest)? Is it THAT financially worth looking into to take longer to pay off the principle? If so where the heck do I begin.

I realize there is a lot of backstory for what could be simple questions. Is there a better way to combine our finances that we're not seeing? What are the best sorts of investments to look into once we feel good about our savings? Is there a better way for me to approach my debt now knowing we do have excess? Any advice is welcome. Thank you!

Bitcoin,"In a world with only bitcoin, raising a credit would be much more expensive, and this is why.","This is  also an explanation to point 6 in my post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1w8icr/bitcoin_could_promote_world_peace_and_here_is_why/

To understand my assumption, it's important to understand how money fiat money is created.

Fiat money is dept money. Fiat money is created only when someone raises a credit. Banks must have a ~ 2% minimum reserve. That means, to lend someone 100.000 USD, the bank must have someone who has min. 2.000 USD on his/her bank account. The bank is paying ~5% intrest on the 2.000 USD (2000*0,05 = 10 USD) and the bank ""earns"" ~10% interest on the 100.000 USD (100.000 * 0,10 =  10.000 USD). So the bank has a profit of 10.000 - 10 = 9.990 USD
That means when someone has 2000 USD on his/her bank account, the bank can earn up to 9990 USD. That is about 5 times of what someone gave to the bank before.
In a bitcoin financial system  Banks must have a 100% minimum reserve, because they can't create bitcoin out of thin air. So to lend someone 100 BTC the bank must find a  backer who gives 100 BTC to the Bank. To get the same gain as in the old system (5 times of what someone has on his bank account), the bank would need to charge min. 500% interest.

No one would raise a credit with 500% interest. That means, in a world with bitcoin, banks must reduce their profit gap to find someone who wants to raise a credit.

(minimum reserve is between 2% and 10% depending on the country and of course you can adjust the interest rates, but you will come to the same conculsion)

Trading,AzJack's ES Trading Plan for Jan 27,"*ES Trade Plan for Monday, Jan 27 2014*

Friday finally took us out of the trading range we’d been in for weeks back into a slightly-less explored area. Before I write my ES Trade Plan for tomorrow, I want to review where we’ve been and what we’ve learned.

*Where We’ve Been*

Friday took us out of the range we’ve been trading in literally all year down into the 1780s. We can say for certain that all previous support above us is now violated, but we’ll have to watch to see if it becomes resistance.

I have new support at 1780.25 and nothing significant under that till the high 1760s. I’d prefer a more defined support point below us, but I just don’t see anything. That is both good news and bad news. Good news because I could set a target just using the 5D ATR, bad news because that’s mostly just hoping.

As I look closer, the 1760s are not well-explored. Neither is the 1810-1830 range. Since the 1760s are closer, that’s a higher likelihood.

The range between Friday’s close of 1782 and 1806 was last explored between mid-November and mid-December. The December 18 announcement of a $10B reduction in the monthly Fed bond purchases sent us rocketing out of that range into the 1800s, but perhaps now we are going to explore again.

*Daily View*

A daily chart shows resistance around 1798, but that could just as easily be Big Round Number resistance. Nevertheless, from support at 1780 to possible resistance at 1798 is a good 18 point range. That’s a little outside of “normal”, but not so far that we couldn’t do it during a normal day.

*About “normal” days*

As you know if you follow me, I track the 5 Day Average True Range. I believe that tells me what a “normal” range for a “normal” day is. The behavior of the ES is that we have multiple smallish range days where we explore prices between major support and resistance.

*Weekly View*

A weekly chart is even more revealing. We support under us at 1768.75 which is well within reach, then support under that at about 1754 – again, about a 15 point spread.

I have a regression channel on my weekly chart which has as its anchor points the March 2009 low and the all-time high this month. Last week’s big move down actually brought us back down into that channel after having been extended well above it for the past two months.

*Plan for Tomorrow*

As always, I will wait for directional confirmation to be sure I am not trading against the trend. I will also check the overnight range to make sure I am not trying to take too much in a direction that has already put in the range.

Entry point tomorrow is 1780.75-1782. Direction will be dictated by the price action. Target 1 will be 10 points. Target 2 will be 1760 if short, 1798 if long. Stop Loss Trigger will be 1/3rd of expected profit. Time frame will the week.

We will also be approaching the 100DMA down below us, so I expect that to provide support, although I put less value in moving average S/R lines than in actual price support locations.",finance,1390789933

Bitcoin,OWS 2.0 - Occupy Satoshi,"January 28, 2014 ~ Take a look around the internet right now; you don't actually see trees and park benches, surely not even virtual pigeons. What you see, though, is Zuccoti Park, circa 2011.

This is Occupy Wall Street 2.0, and this time the masses have a weapon.

OWS began as a protest to Big Bank Bailouts, The Federal Reserves fractional banking policies and Corporate personhood in America. It quickly caught fire to include over half the countries in the world. While these people of the 99% met, extraordinary ideas, wisdom and thoughts were communicated, local spokes councils were created and mock governments continue even to this very day.

It's hard to imagine that Bitcoin was two years old during that time. The OWS movement was searching for a political weapon, yet Bitcoin had not been fully realized.

As the movement engaged in an act of international protest, time marched on it began to take the form of disruption. But without a tool, the entire occupy movement was quelled by the end of 2011.

Fast forward to 2014: Bitcoin eclipsed the $1000 mark for the third time in three months, settling down within the $900 range. While still considered volatile from an investment standpoint, the cryptocurrency has entrenched itself in global markets. Because sales remain the bottom line to any business, merchants have found catering to bitcoin users extremely lucrative. 

Centralized Power

Originally what brought Bitcoin to the mainstream was the takedown of Silk Road. At a cost of 144,000 bitcoin, the virtual community got more than it bargained for - 5000% appreciation of the bitcoin they held. Considering that the seized bitcoin belonged to an alleged criminal, it was bitcoin well spent.

Where bicoin enthusiasts find new hope, the Powers That Be despise it, in that it upsets the staus quo to Central Banks, Credit Card companies and governments. The IMF actually has a term for it's disruptive nature:

""Specifically, Bitcoin poses a liability to the IMF and its member nations in the event it is used in what is referred to as a 'speculative attack' on another currency"".

To the ire of the Internet community, the U.S. government strong-armed traditional payment services to put the squeeze on wikileaks during a time when whistleblowing was becoming fashion.The online community never forgot it, and in time bitcoin gained traction. Bitcoin top all other currency donations to the embattled site, a source of legal funding to aid whistleblowers around the world. 

Presently, nations have economically collapsed and still others are on the brink. Consolidated power has reached new heights and transparency seemingly only exists through whistleblowers.

Giving a nod to Legal Marijuana, the U.S. Justice Department this week announced that dispensaries would be permitted banking priveledges, most likely an attempt to promote financial institutions over the use of the wildly popular bitcoin.

It's conceivable that the Obama Administration would much rather have marijuana revenue deposited, where balances and records reside, and include the ability to locate and freeze assets easily. With the growing acceptance of bitcoin, this move signals a shift in one policy to combat another.

Friendly vs. Foe

Bitcoin will elude Fortune 500 companies because they are in bed with the status quo - that is to say that many are knitted together in the form of conglomerates, who in turn help regulate their own industries with financial institutions. It is these entities are that earn the contempt of the occupy movement, and are labeled as villians in the march for Democracy.

So, it's only reasonable that the for-runners of bitcoin merchants consist of renegade companies who have nothing to lose and everything to gain by accepting bitcoin for payment. This signifies a unique shift for the freedom movement, where once only individuals stood to combat Big Brother and Little Brother, now joining the flanks to include multimillion dollar companies.

Battle For Your Mind

The battlefield, of course, is for you mind. Bitcoin would be nothing without widespread adoption, and the scathing opinions published by so-called academics lend credence to the impending war.

For every hurdle bitcoin clears, scolars mount attacks on everything from the volatile nature to the security of an unbacked currency. What they just don't seem to get is that no currency is backed - the gold standard was abolished in 1977. Just ask Greece where their financial backing is.

It was only a decade ago when consumers were fleeced for simply using their credit cards online, left feeling vulnerable. Technology still has not solved the problem of hacking personal information. In the U.S., archaic magnetic strip technology is still the standard, allowing for the world's number one consumer market to be rift with fraud.

The 'experts' would have you believe that bitcoin remains insecure, which is entirely untrue. Add to this the growing number of co-opt pieces where these educated experts time and again misinform the reader, making false statements that can be debunked with simple research they obviously did not do in preparation.  These opinions are simply trashed in comment sections, causing one to wonder if an academic should lose tenure over such a laspe of integrity.

Our Future

The fate of bitcoin lies in the U.S. where committees - playing the role of regulators - vie for a piece of the pie. Make no mistake, Uncle Sam wants a piece of that pie - he just hasn't yet figured out how to get his sticky hands on bitcoin yet. But with a country whose democracy is built on regulation, there stands to be some sort of hamstring attempt to take the legs out of bitcoin.

In conclusion, it's apparent that the battle lines are drawn, teams are set and game time is now. Mass adoption is required in order for bitcoin to truly disrupt. As merchants gradually come to accept bitcoin, the true growth of the virtual currency will be every single person who installs a bitcoin wallet and occupy's a Satoshi.

If I gave one satoshi to every friend who opened a bitcoin wallet and each of them did the same, these transactions would not only impregnate the bitcoin block chain permanently, but extend a history our children could look back on and validate our march for a future free of economic indenture.",cryptocurrency,1390793706

gaming,Someone used my Origin account and played a BF3 with a hack (or something). Now I am banned in BF3 + BF4 and EA won't help me,"I need your help, reddit.

Last year I purchased Battlefield 3 for PC and had a blast with it, until one day I was unable to connect to almost any server I tried because of a punkbuster ban. I thought it was temporary and may have had to do with a program I used to run the game in a Borderless Window mode. I couldn't think of anything else that could cause it so I settled on that and figured it was temporary so I'd just wait it out. Some time went by and I tried again to find that I still couldn't play. I tried reinstalling the game, punkbuster, and playing on other PCs. Nothing worked. Fortunately BF4 was announced so I decided just to wait for that instead of bothering to figure out the problem with 3.

Come November and I find myself with a new Xbox One so I buy BF4 for it. It's great but my friends are playing on PC so I end up buying a copy on PC as well. 

What I did not realize is that the ban on BF3 carried over to BF4 (I think) and here I am today unable to play on many servers. I realize that I should have figured out the issue with 3 and PunkBuster and decide to do something about it now. 

After contacting Even Balance (PunkBuster) I am told that their policy is not to unban ""GUIDs"" and that I have to request a new CDKey or account from EA. I was very surprised about this and somewhat freak out. They told me that if it wasn't me that cheated then someone may have used my account. Since I can't recall ever having issues with my account, I dismiss that possibility. But then tonight I notice that my avatar image within the Origin PC Application is something odd. It was a photo of a girl pointing at a marking on her shirt. I then noticed that my country is set to Russian Federation and the language set to a Russian language. I change those 3 things back, enable the extra security on my account, and contact EA via their chat support system.

Upon talking to ""K"" on their chat support system I am told that there is nothing they can do as they do not see any history of me contacting them about my account becoming compromised. I tell K that this chat is in regards to that as well as getting my ""GUID"" fixed. In short, they refuse to help me and claim not to have the ability to see account changes to see that my account was once set to Russian.

I ask for a refund of not only BF4 but also BF3 and while I am at it BF4 for Xbox One as well, as now I am upset and angry towards EA yet again. Of course, they will not help me out.

Bitcoin,Mtgox newbie info here.,"Guys, I'm fed up of hearing your repeated questions.

* Mtgox.com is not a ""scam"". Their banks only allow a certain amount of Fiat cash flow daily (cannot recall actual number, maybe someone else can). For this reason Fiat currencies queue and can take weeks/months to release.  
* You need to **verify your account**. This includes for **BTC withdrawals**. You can deposit (and trade) without verification. 
* The price of BTC is +$100. Fiat withdrawal takes forever, so many people are forced to by bitcoins since those are the only currency available to them for withdrawal. This creates a buying pressure. The price differential is a very bad sign, it's not some elegant prediction of future exchange rates. (Thanks xrandr).
* Their customer support does suck.  Many responses are copy and paste. What do you expect from such a large business requiring no real involvement and things still function? People can't read/don't want to verify... They profit. Bad practise yes but more fool the guy who didn't follow their requirements.  
* If you're unsure on MtGox, post your question here and we'll try to answer. If still unsure, avoid MtGox.

Hope this helps you before you lose/delay your money and post another repeated Mtgox.com hate thread.

People buying from mtgox with their trapped money are mainly due to them not knowing their option.
You can pay mtgox 5% processing fee to withdraw the money. Sure, it is still a shitty option and you will still need to wait. But that sure beat buying bitcoin at 20% marked up and suffer a bigger lost.

dogecoin,[META] The benefits of uniting ourselves with our crypto brothers,"My fellow Shibes, I have gained a deeper understanding of the notion of ‘community’ in the last month and a half. Probably more than I have in many other social endeavors that did not take place behind a computer. I've seen people who have never seen each other in person unite behind their computers, embrace each other, and band together to support great causes, enjoy themselves, and self-educate about a revolutionary financial industry that is currently in its crawling stage. An industry that could possibly change the way we trade between each other in everyday life, for the rest of our lives.

During my time here, I have learned that we here at /r/dogecoin have community. We have numbers. We have our distinguishable and recognizable identity. 

While I have been heavily involved here at /r/dogecoin, I started educating myselves about other crypto currencies as well. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Nxt, Mooncoin, you name it. And I became more and more aware of the fact that we are divided.

We are deeply divided. Some Bitcoiners may exude an air of superiority because of their seniority and being top doge on the charts. Some Litecoiners may display arrogance and be quick to dismiss other crypto currencies because they were the second player in the game, attaining a respectable market value as a result. And some of us Shibes have proved to be provocative and rude, bombarding other subreddits with downvotes and troll comments. Many of you know this because you have seen it for yourselves. Some people have gone as far as announcing an imminent 'war' between crypto currencies. Blasphemy of course. But it did get me thinking.

The way all Shibes united to support the Jamaican bobsled team was amazing. Nobody ever anticipated such an overwhelmingly positive response - including media outlets all over the world. And since then, /r/Litecoin has caught on as well! With their project to fund the planting of 100,000 trees to counteract the environmental effects of mining, they are taking a positive step towards spreading the word of mouth that the Litecoin community stands united to improve the world while displaying the usefulness of crypto currency. 

Because that is the main hurdle we have to jump, folks. It is not beating other crypto currencies and competing for a higher spot on the crypto currency charts. It is really about gaining credibility for our system as a whole and our positive, welcoming communities. Because most of the world still does not take crypto currency all that seriously. 

Isn't it time we unite ourselves with other crypto currencies? That we clasp hands and embrace each other, and find ways to unite our interests - the way we accept newcomers here at /r/Dogecoin? Because we are all in the same boat. And as individual communities, we may not be able to achieve much more than competing against other coins and rising a few spots. But if we unite, we could compete as a financial system on the rise against the current banking system. Individually, /r/Dogecoin has achieved great things. Combined with more established and growing crypto coins, we could all make it to the Moon. There's no doubt about it.

An alliance of crypto currencies, dedicating themselves to worthy causes, promoting themselves and their counterparts and collectively rising to the top. I will be making a post later in /r/Cryptocurrency, I hope it gets some attention and positive feedback from other communities.

TLDR; How about we start working together and rise above the confining limits of being a single crypto coin? Let's become a proud part of a massive community which works together to achieve great things and establish itself as the futurustic, viable alternative to today’s banking system. Let's look for ways to work together with other crypto currencies so the world will take note that we trust each other's system as well - and increase our strength in numbers and influence exponentially.",cryptocurrency,1390818392

* 2011 Direct Unsub Stafford Loan - $2,000.00 6.8% interest rate, already accruing

personalfinance,70-something parents want to give us money,"My folks are at an age now where they are required to take RMDs from their IRAs (mostly dad's, he was always the primary wage earner and he's about to turn 70-and-a-half).  Between their pensions and social security it sounds like they already have an annual income somewhere just shy of $100k.  Several years ago they generously started funding a 529 for our two kids (now ages 6 and 10) and have recently started talking to me about wanting to transfer money to us, particularly for our children's education but also to make our own lives more comfortable as well.  We currently gross a little over $100k a year from my job (wife is a SAHM) but about $50-60k of that goes into 457, 403(b), traditional IRA and HSA accounts so we have a very low federal tax burden.  

One of my parents' main concerns seems to be moving into the 28% marginal tax bracket.  They do have some assets in Roths, which I'm pretty sure don't have RMDs and can be inherited.  We haven't even talked ballpark numbers yet.  Another complicating factor is that we have a grandmother who is about to become a centenarian and who has high-six-figures in assets (she lives off SS and a pretty good pension) mostly CDs spread across a bunch of banks local to her.  They're also looking at dealing with inheriting from her in the next few years (though given her health she might live another ten years!).  

My question to the community is: are there mechanisms they could use (while they're still alive) to give us money (toward education or our own retirement) that would minimize their federal tax burden? From my reading there's no way to just do an intergenerational IRA transfer, but as this is a community that has a lot of clever ideas, I thought I'd ask for thought/input.

but the implications of this, arent really talked about. and this trial is in fact a danger to all crypto currencies, and a direct political attack on their existence. 

when you look closer at the charge, which is ""knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way.""
seeing as he this charge is based on him providing a currency, that he knows some people use to buy drugs, and makes a profit from it, it also applies to the head of the federal reserve, their staff, everyone getting paid by any currency exchange, and so on. 

this makes it blatantly obvious that this is an attack on the crypto currency supply chain, and all crypto's need to stand together and fight this, it is our very existence he is fighting for in court.
i beg every notable shibe to take this and run with it. if you frequent other crypto's communication channels, get them involved in this fight, if you know how to get in touch with the dogecoin foundation, please do so, if you know people in media channels, contact them, spread the word on social media, etc etc etc. we must stand together, and we cannot let this trial get overlooked, without the public eye on it, the political agenda can be pushed through.",cryptocurrency,1390855143

The quick and dirty version: I'm 28, live in Toronto and make $35k per year (before taxes). I currently owe ~$40k in student loans to my bank (student line of credit), ~$9k in student loans to the federal government, and have a maxed out credit card ($4k) which I used to subsist on while job hunting this past summer.

My monthly expenses -- the ones I can't do anything about, anyway -- include rent ($750), line of credit (~$150), credit card (~$80), student loans (~$40), cell phone (~$45), Internet (~$24) and electricity (~$40-45). Everything else is negotiable, including food. I'm paid bi-weekly, to the tune of about $1,086.

Now that you know me a bit better, my question is this: How can I best pay off my line of credit, student loans and credit card, and in what order? Beyond putting every spare cent I have on my credit card until it's paid off, I'm kind of at a loss as far as what to do.

personalfinance,Tax questions ~ 2012 and 2013,"2012 taxes:

I'm still a dumb kid, but I was even more dumb a year ago. I never filed my 2012 taxes. I have my W-2s from my first job (I received two, one from the franchisee and one from corporate when they bought the store out) and my 1098-T form from my community college.

As for my W-2s: I claimed myself on my I-9 forms when I got hired for some dumb reason. I didn't completely understand the form because it was my first job. I don't have them in front of me right now, but they should have like $5-700 withheld from my taxed wages. I was a cook paid minimum wage and didn't receive too many tips, they're not on my W-2s.

And my 1098-T form: This is from community college. There's about $3,000 of tuition and educational expenses recorded on it. This was all paid out of pocket from my job. I had no scholarships or federal aid.

I had never filed my 2012 taxes... I didn't make enough money to owe the IRS anything, so I figured it wasn't too horrible of a deal. I was a dumb kid and I didn't understand it and it frustrated me, then I kept putting it off and well here we are. Will I still be able to file my 2012 taxes?

2013 taxes:

I have W-2s from that first job, but I quit because they were forcing me to work 60 hours and it was interrupting my focus on college. There's only like $300 in withheld taxes, and again, I didn't make enough money to be required to pay anything.

I received two 1098-T forms for 2013: community college and university. My 1098-T from community college has $1,375 in payments received, and my 1098-T from university has $7,745 in amounts billed. Is there a difference and is it important? I have a Pell grant, unsub&amp;sub loans, and an alternative loan.

Is there anything I need to know about the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the lifetime Learning Tax Credit? If any background info is needed, I'm an 18 year-old Junior who is a dependent.

Once a upon a time people traded in gold and silver. it was physical and people could store it in there own house. Then one day some smart men saw the value of these coins so they created the federal reserve. The federal reserve was designed to replace the physical gold and silver, and instead provide a physical currency called the USD. People thought they had gold and silver, but now it was in paper form. They did not realise the paper form could be controlled, and over the years, all the gold and silver was controlled by the federal reserve. People still felt that they had value because now they owned a paper form of their Gold in the name of USD. Overtime the gold, and silver disappeared. Those who still own physical gold and silver are now rich because it is very rare. But for the most of the other population, they are now trading iin an illusion, they do not have physical control over their assets. It is also now very difficult to buy physical gold and silver, and so the prices have increased tremendously. The wise ones kept their gold and silver. and the dumb gave its control to the Federal Reserve.",cryptocurrency,1390883959

They ask for specific terms that I don't understand and I don't know who to ask to help me figure them out. Usually I just fill them out as minimally as possible and make sure i've reported everything that my tax documents have printed on them. This year I have only a W2 and a 1098e.

This year, I worked at a company in California all year and at no other employer. I earned $41,222. I lived in NYC for 3 months, in CT for 6 months, and in CA for 3 months.

I got every penny of my CT taxes back, and this seemed confusing to me since I lived there for 6 months. Even more confusing is that my CA state taxes seem to think that I owe them $875 on top of the $250 I've already paid. This is based on my ""taxable income"" in CA being the entire $41,222. How is my whole income taxable when I only lived in CA for 3 months?

The only thing that makes sense to me is that my NY taxes were for the city and I got my state taxes back, and that CT and NY states don't get any of my income in taxes because my job was located in CA the whole time anyway. But that also kind of doesn't make sense.

I keep going back and re-checking my CA return and there's nothing I can see that I'm missing. Surely it can't be that CA can tax me on 100% of my income even when I lived in (and paid tax in) other states 75% of the year?

Bitcoin,"Why you should never EVER want bitcoins to become ""currency"" or refer to bitcoin or altcoins as ""currency"" EVER.","Why you should never EVER want bitcoins to become ""currency"" or refer to bitcoin or altcoins as ""currency"" EVER.


Its simple - do you want to pay 35% in taxes on trading or 15%?

from
http://www.fxop.com/Forex%20Taxation.html

""
By way of background, the maximum marginal federal income tax rates applicable in the U.S. are 35% for items of ordinary income and capital gains resulting from the sale of capital assets held 1 year or less (i.e., short term capital gains) and 15% for capital gains from the sale of capital assets held for more than 1 year.

In addition to these basic rules, currency traders potentially subject to two special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. One is Section 1256 which generally applies to regulated futures contracts and provides that no matter what a taxpayer’s holding period for a futures position is, 60% of any gain recognized is treated as long term capital gain and 40% of any gain recognized is treated as short term capital gain. This is sometimes known as the 60/40 rule. As a result of application of the 60/40 rule to futures contracts, a blended 23% federal income tax rate applies to any gains. This is one of the principal advantages of trading futures over stocks. While short term stock trading will produce short term capital gains taxable at a 35% federal income tax rate; trading in futures will produce income subject to a 23% federal income tax rate regardless of how long or short the futures contract is held.

In addition to Section 1256, Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code contains special rules governing the tax treatment of currency gains and losses. In general, Section 988 provides that gains and losses from currency trades are treated as ordinary income (and taxable at a maximum 35% federal income tax rate). There is an exception to this rule, however. Section 988 provides an exception for currency positions which are identified by election as excluded from Section 988 ordinary income treatment. If proper identification and an election is made, gains and losses from currency trading will be treated as capital gains and losses. Moreover, to the extent that the currency pair traded is traded on a U.S. futures exchange, the spot contract is subject to the special 60/40 treatment under Section 1256, which results in a 23% tax rate on gains (regardless of holding period). This important since most cash or spot currency contracts settle in two days, but are typically terminated and rolled over daily (thus preventing a long term holding period from ever developing).

personalfinance,To refinance or to not refinance (a car loan)?,"Hello, you smart, wonderful people of PF.  
I have a have a question about whether or not to try and refinance a car loan and i will try to explain my situation.
My husband and I got married summer 2012 and then he got orders in October for Hawaii.  We needed to condense our two cars into one due to shipping reasons.
My car was financed @ 2.6% and his truck @ around 18% (yeah, i know ridiculous). Since my new hubbies credit was so bad we had trouble getting to loan that we wanted (30k) event though we could easily afford it (since we were going from have 2 payments to one).  We had a lot of hard inquires on both of our credit during this time. We did finally get approved for the 30k loan @ 12% interest.  
Since then, my hubby has  cleaned up his credit (from ~580 to ~680) and mine is around 725.  I constantly get pre-approval credit card offers in the mail and he occasionally gets them. 
I recently got one from NavyFed for a pre-approved auto loan.  This makes me believe  that would may be able to get approved for refinance at a rate better than 12%. We do have a lot of hard inquiries on our credit still.  Is it worth it to try? Or should we wait it out?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin-qt Wallet Portable for Linux,"I've recently built a portable package of Bitcoin-qt client for Linux. I needed the security of Linux, but I didn't have the portability. I knew about PortableLinuxApps and I thought - ""why not give it a try and build something that might actually be useful"". Many people are confused and most of the times they don't know how to compile on Linux. My main idea was to bring something that just works. I thought I'd be good to open up a project on Sourceforge and upload my recent work:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/cryptoclients/

I used AppImageKit to create the app. All libraries that bitcoin-qt requires are contained in the executable *.run file. You don't need to install anything. The app will run flawlessly on: Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE.

If you're curious about what's inside the *.run file, you can use AppImageExtract to peek inside:

If you want to improve, modify or fix the package you can use AppImageKit to rebuild the app yourself:

I haven't had a paycheck yet but I think my take home pay will be around $4k per month.


I signed up for 6% 401k (company matches 100% of 1% then 50% of 2-6%).


Federals loans deferred until April, private loans deferred until July (made 1 goodwill payment and applied for deferment before I got lucky with a job offer). Minimum payment on all loans will be $1100/month.


So obviously CC debt is first. Then should I start an emergency fund? Or trigger repayment on my loans to avoid added interest? Or take advantage of deferment to pay CC /build EF/save for potentially needed car replacement. Am I stupid to be matching 401k with all my debt? Anything I'm missing?

personalfinance,Tax refund way off from expectations. What am I missing?,"In 2013 I graduated from grad school, got a job and got married last year.  My wife and I were both able to get jobs, mine starting in May 2013 and hers starting in August.  We both filled out our W-4s as married but withold at higher single rate and 1 allowance.  Combined we made around 48k (45k yearly income each) before taxes and pre-tax accounts (401k).  

I was expecting that we might get a few hundred dollars on our return (paid $2,500 in student loan interest) but when I filled out all the paper work we will be getting 3.4k federal and almost a grand from the state (colorado).  I have no clue why our taxes were so far off and we are owed this large a chunk.  Was this due to the fact that we only worked 1/2 the year?

investing,Obama announces new retirement savings bond MyRA,"The White House offered details Wednesday about a new retirement savings account that President Barack Obama unveiled in his State of the Union address. He’s calling the accounts “myRA.”

While any savings would accumulate over time, the low-risk investments would not deliver whopping returns. If they are pegged to the Thrift Savings Plan Government Securities Investment Fund, they would have had an annual return of 1.47% in 2012, or an average annual return of 3.61% from 2003 through 2012. Of course, the savings would compound, and even a small return is better than a loss. Here are nine things to know about myRA accounts:

1.) The accounts would be aimed at workers whose employers do not offer traditional retirement accounts like 401(k)s.

2.) The accounts would function like a Roth IRA and have government backing like a savings bond. This would give the investments principal protection, meaning the account balance cannot go down.

3.) There will be an initial pilot program for companies that agree to enroll by the end of this year. Workers can invest if they make less than $191,000 a year.

4.) Businesses will not administer or run the accounts. They will simply offer them to their employees if they decide to participate.

5.) There will not be a tax penalty if the investments are withdrawn.

6.) Initial investments could begin at $25, and subsequent investments could be as low as $5. The idea is to have investments added through payroll deductions.

7.) Accounts can be taken by the employee from one job to the next, and they can be rolled into an Individual Retirement Account at any time.

8.) The accounts would have the same variable interest rate return as the Thrift Savings Plan Government Securities Investment Fund accounts that federal employees enroll in.

9.) Once someone’s account grows to $15,000, the myRA must be rolled over into a private-sector Roth IRA.

dogecoin,Of Wolves And Weasels - Day 22 - A New Chapter Begins,"Hey all! GoodShibe here,

This is an exciting time for Dogecoin right now - I mean outside of all the new shibes flooding into this sub - we're starting to do something that very few coins have managed: 

A legal, direct exchange from DOGE to USD/CAD currency and back.  This is happening, starting today, over at [Vault of Satoshi](https://www.vaultofsatoshi.com/).  

Yes, there are some hurdles to jump through - legal stuff, mostly - but it's there and it's up.  *It exists*.

Not only does this show an incredible amount of confidence in our currency -- it's a lot of work to even start to put together an exchange from USD/CAD to cryptos -- but considering that our currency is only around *7 Weeks old* that tells you exactly how hard we've all been working.  

Every tip to a new user, every funny little Dogecoin meme, every $20 ad tossed up on Reddit, every act of compassion and charity - little by little we're bringing people to us, our confidence and compassion and flat-out sense of fun is infectious.

In a time of world turmoil, of uncertainty, we're still doing what we do best -- and people want to be a part of that.  

This is a HUGE victory for us.  

It's also an important victory for us in another sense, as it allows us to begin the process of detaching ourselves, at least partially, from Bitcoin.  This is both good and bad in that when Bitcoin rises, historically, we've gone with them -- and when they fall, so to do we.  We're not cutting the cord entirely, but considering that the main way to get DOGE has been buying BTC and converting it to DOGE through an exchange, this will allow us to forego one major step in the chain.  And as more and more exchanges start to come on board, allowing us to move freely to and from DOGE, this cord may even end up being cut entirely.  Meaning we'll be on our own.

If that's not both exhilarating and scary as heck, I don't know what is.  But it's coming down the pipe.  And maybe sooner than we think.

The timing also works well because of the level of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) going around in Bitcoin as of late.  Yes, on the surface, everything's fine - they've been getting great adoption rates lately and really are doing quite well (and I wish them well).  But there's a general uncertainty building thanks to articles like this: 

[Mega Default In China Scheduled For January 31](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/2014/01/19/mega-default-in-china-scheduled-for-january-31/)

[Additional Sources Confirm China’s Payment Processor Ban, Bitcoin Price Falls $200](http://www.coindesk.com/sources-confirm-chinas-payment-processor-ban-bitcoin-price-falls/)

Now, yes, these articles are around/over a month old, but both articles -- being from reputable sources -- say one very important point:  On January 31st, Chinese New Year, the People's Republic of China will be closing all 3rd party payment processors.  This further limits people's ability to exchange - and use - Bitcoin in China.

Bitcoin's greatest rise and fall was because of the influx of -- and outpouring of -- Chinese investors last year and the sting, while mostly healed, can still be felt in stories like this.  And rightly so, it was one heck of a sting.  You see, when the Chinese Government put regulations on Bitcoin, a lot of investors panicked - thinking that Bitcoin was being outright banned (which was wholly untrue). That panic fed into a massive campaign of fear and disinformation, causing... well, pretty much a mass hysteria, leading to investors ditching the currency almost as fast as they'd bought it up... and that caused a severe and violent crash. 

Now, granted, this move has been telegraphed for a very long time (over a month now) so it should be no surprise and that when the 31st hits, those who wanted out will have already gotten out.  But there's still that sense of uncertainty, wondering exactly how smooth the transition will be.

For Dogecoin, a decent chunk of our growth has been from Bitcoiners looking to diversify their portfolios, looking to protect themselves from these sorts of general gloom and doom scenarios that push their currency down.  Hopefully, once the 31st passes with a smooth transition, BTC will start its climb again.  But for Dogecoin, having these exchange options open to us, it can and will insulate our currency from these sorts of issues.

The biggest problem was that Bitcoin was entering a market where the Government hadn't yet decided what to do about Cryptocurrencies - so all eyes were focused on what the PRoC were going to do about it.  Which, again, created uncertainty.  Seeing how Bitcoin blew up like it did, and how China has a history of knocking down things when they get too big on their own ([see QQ](http://www.informationweek.com/e-commerce/china-limits-use-of-virtual-currency/d/d-id/1080926) China's first uber-successful virtual currency) it all makes sense... in hindsight (20/20 vision being what it is and all).

The good thing about Dogecoin is that we're being exchanged in a market that has already made themselves pretty clear about how they feel about cryptocurrencies - [Canada treats them like a commodity](https://www.coinforum.ca/discussion/551/canadian-government-finally-takes-position-on-bitcoin) - which should help protect us, barring a sudden change of attitude/regulation from the Canadian Government.

All-in-all, this is truly the start of something huge for Dogecoin.  Not only is this a severe blow to scammers (which, as mod of /r/Dogecoinscamwatch, fills me with endless amounts of joy) but a lot of eyes will be watching VoS, and if they start making money - good money - others will jump in to grab a slice of that pie (which will further help stabilize our DOGEs). 

And that's why NOW is the time to capitalize on it.  We need to get more outreach efforts off the ground, more charitable responses.  I'll be donating 20,000 DOGE (10K from me, 10K from /u/ericnakagawa) - on top of the 5K I've already given - to BellLetsTalk on Twitter, a campaign to raise awareness for Mental Health.  They don't take Dogecoins, but hopefully, when they see that there's a decent amount of them coming in, they'll be amenable to it.  Money is money is money, right?  Especially now that they can exchange those cryptos on Vault of Satoshi and get their money's worth.  

Incidentally, that 15K Doge I'm donating is ENTIRELY from you.  Your tips.  What you've given to me, I am giving back in outreach.  That 5K I gave to Notch, to try and get his attention (Which, sadly, it seems, did not work) was also from you.

So far your tips have amounted to approximately 40,000 DOGE since I've started doing 'Of Wolves and Weasels' and I've been using most of that money on outreach, on tipping, and doing what I can to help spread the word.  (I'm saving a bit for myself too, hope you don't mind :D)

Let's keep on getting the word out there, folks!  We're doing amazing things -- and even better things are waiting for us, just out there on the horizon.

It's 8:38AM EST, we're at 38.65% of DOGEs found.  Our Global Hashrate is down into a semi-stable ~77 Gigahashes per second - after a massive spike to ~224 very early this morning - and our Difficulty is falling from ~1070 to ~1011.  Looks like another nice day to hit the mines, people!  Let's get to it! :D)

As always, I appreciate your support!

personalfinance,myRAs: A Brief WSJ Overview,"Article [here](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/01/29/nine-things-to-know-about-obamas-myra-accounts/) (not paywalled).

Highlights &amp; some questions:

&gt;1.) The accounts would be aimed at workers whose employers do not offer traditional retirement accounts like 401(k)s.

I wonder what ""traditional retirement accounts"" includes - 457s?  403bs?  SIMPLE IRAs?

&gt;2.) The accounts would function like a Roth IRA and have government backing like a savings bond. This would give the investments principal protection, meaning the account balance cannot go down.

How about inflation protection?

&gt;3.) There will be an initial pilot program for companies that agree to enroll by the end of this year. Workers can invest if they make less than $191,000 a year.

Married couples?  

&gt;4.) Businesses will not administer or run the accounts. They will simply offer them to their employees if they decide to participate.

What are the costs of doing so?

&gt;5.) There will not be a tax penalty if the investments are withdrawn.

No tax penalty on the principal, or neither the principal nor the earnings?  If it functions ""just like a Roth IRA"" then there should be a penalty on the earnings.

&gt;6.) Initial investments could begin at $25, and subsequent investments could be as low as $5. The idea is to have investments added through payroll deductions.

&gt;7.) Accounts can be taken by the employee from one job to the next, and they can be rolled into an Individual Retirement Account at any time.

personalfinance,Should I Refinance?,"Hello,

I'm a 25 year old who has owned his home for about 2-3 years now. Though a little late to the game, I am just now learning about refinancing and what it means. This has brought me to a very in-depth question, should I refinance?

I currently have two loans: my mortgage and my car loan. Below you will find a basic breakdown of the two.

-------------------------------------------

**-- Mortgage --**

**Balance:** $51690.31

**Original Balance:** $53405

**Payment:** $396

**Closing Date:** 8/19/2011

**Maturity Date:** 12/1/2041

**Interest Rate:** 5%

**APR:** ?

**Current Property Value:** $80,000-$90,000

**Note:** I also make a montly $350 dollar HOA payment.

------------------------------------------------------

**-- Auto Loan --**

**Balance:** $14127.71

**Original Balance:** $22909.8

**Payment:** $381.83

**Closing Date:** 1/30/2012

**Maturity Date:** 2/15/2017

**Interest Rate:** 0%

**APR:** 0%

**Note:** Ford Credit states my interest and APR is 0%. Credit Karma states my APR 8.5%. I don't understand this..

-------------------------------------

My credit is a lousy 650 mostly due to neglecting a department store credit card. I was dumb and I deeply regret this. I am working on restoring my credit, however I'm worried this will hurt me if I do decide to refinance.

I don't know where to start in making that decision whether I should refinance or not. Honestly, it would help greatly if I can lower my monthly payments, but I'm worried about closing costs and paying a lot more in the long run. 

Should I refinance just my mortgage? Should I refinance both my car and mortgage? Should I consolidate the two (this sounds like a bad idea, due to depreciation of my car and other factors).

I know I'm asking a lot here. Any advice will greatly assist. Maybe I should talk to a financial professional?

Thanks in advanced for any tips :)",finance,1391012874

Bitcoin,My BitAccess BTM Experience,"Hi Reddit,
I just got back from BitAccess' BTM in Ottawa and felt the need to share my experience.

Two weekends ago I went downtown for the main purpose of trying out this new system. To my disappointment, the BTM was down as they needed to fix up the UX before making it always open to the public (which no one at the Clocktower seemed to know; they just said it was broken). So, I decided to return later once they should have had time to fix up the bugs. Fast-forward to today: I stopped by again to hopefully get my hands on some more BTC, and was greeted by an up-and-running machine. I was hopefully optimistic as I went through the verification process. Once I had scanned my paper wallet in, it took me to a screen saying the exchange was down. Confused, I retried twice, both times getting the same message. The internet appearted to be working fine, as it was displaying the BTC-CAD price correctly. While I was there, I tried to find a phone number for BitAccess to get more info on why it was doing this, but not only do they not display it, they haven't updated their Twitter in over a month. Needless to say, I'm extremely fed up that both times I tried to use the BTM to exchange my fiat for crypto I was unable to.

If anyone from BitAccess (or anyone at all) could please explain what the error I was experiencing was, that would be greatly appreciated.

1) He believes that the numbers on Chinese exchange Huboi are real. He's a trader there as well. When I spoke to him about how orders are spread-apart for other exchange (like BTC China) he said ""Chinese don't care about little fractions of a dollar. If I want to buy it now I buy it, if not, I don't. We also don't have so many miners selling on Huboi, I think that's the reason why people are not trying to outbid each other.""

2) He has no idea what the rumors are about January 31st. He went to explain that just like the US government Chinese government has three branches: Federal, State and Local. He said that there haven't been any clear statement from the Federal government nor the State government. It was the local government who advised about the ban of 3rd party payment processors but that is about it. There haven't been any clear message from State or Federal level other than ""we're looking into it"".

dogecoin,An observation on the quality of content being posted.,"Hi Shibes,

I am noticing a trend that, whilst understandable, is bothering me a little. The /new section of our subreddit is becoming a bit of a wasteland of reposts and 'giveaways'; now I have nothing against either of these things but let me develop my argument a little and apologies for the wall of text. TL;DR - I think we need to focus more on group efforts that have aims **outwith** our own community than we are currently.

After having watched /new closely for the past few days, I break it down into roughly these estimates:

50% of our new content is new shibes asking questions, and promptly being answered by the good shibes in our community, pointed towards the sidebar and shown the path they ought to be on. This is great, I have no problem with this - we all had questions at the start which seem obvious to us now. It's important that we remain open and friendly to them, and don't get snappy and fed up with answering them.

15% is reposted macro images, cross-posts from /r/supershibe or elsewhere, some rehashed so that they have relevance to dogecoin, some simply directly crossposted. I don't have a problem with this, either, but be aware that it clutters things up and doesn't really add much of value to the ongoing conversation that /r/dogecoin is becoming.

Another 15% is genuinely good content - thoughtful questions, good ideas, original artwork, new programs or websites that will help us further promote doge - many of which make the frontpage of our sub and rightly so! They are the important pieces of the puzzle, and we truly owe a debt of gratitude to all the people who have put their time and energy into being innovative shibes and developing new ideas which make our currency more accessible to anyone, anywhere! 

Now, for the final 20%..This is where I have a conflict of emotions - The 'Giveaways' to the first 100 people to comment, or things along those lines - it's fantastic that we are such a giving community, it's something that we all cherish and enjoy partaking in - but these posts appear on new, and shibes pounce on them, like a pack of wild..er..shibes I guess. Within minutes the post has reached it's 'quota' of comments, and hit the front page - surpassing many good ideas along the way. I was thinking maybe we could have a separate subreddit for these things? The posts become benign immediately as soon as the quota has been reached, so that they continue on to the frontpage and take up space where something more insightful or innovative could be irks me slightly.. What do you think? I am very open to this being critiqued, so don't worry about speaking your mind - I just want to ensure that we are putting as much good content to the front of our subreddit as possible, and ensuring that we focus on what's most important; which in my opinion is public awareness, innovative ideas which will aid the spread of dogecoin and ways of making it easier for people to get involved. Community efforts to make our currency really worth investing in! 

Anyway, I've rambled on long enough - have at me, shibes! And I'll wait for /u/redcoatwright to stalk me in here too... I have my eye on you shibe!",cryptocurrency,1391032539

investing,A overly simple guide to how bonds work.,"I've noticed that many don't understand this. I'm going to try to give a very very simple explanation so you can have a basic understanding. 

A bond is a form of debt. 

It pays a set amount (a coupon payment).. This payment ***Never*** changes. 

So lets say a bond is worth $100 today. It pays a fixed $10. Or currently that bond is yielding 10% 

Now lets say interest rates fall to 5%... Market forces will make it so that bond is worth $200 as to get a 5% yield with a $10 payment you must have a $200 bond... Again the coupon payment is ***fixed!!***

For years interest rates have been falling which have been great for bond investors.. As their bonds kept on going up and up in value.. 

As of late though interest rates have gone up.. Which does the opposite... That 5% rate image went to 10%... Meaning the bond went from being worth $200 to $100... Bonds were suppose to be a safe investment and people are freaking out that they are losing their money..&gt; So money has flooded out of the bond market... And into the stock market for better returns (hence why stock market was up so much last year..)

I hope this gives a simple explanation so you can have a basic understanding.. I'm not an expert but please ask questions and I'll try to answer them so you too can have a basic understanding and not be confused when you hear about bonds.",finance,1391036204

personalfinance,Roth TSP and Roth IRA contribution question,"I'm a federal employee and I've been contributing to the Roth TSP since it started in 2012. Since the contributions to the Roth TSP are post-tax, I assumed a Roth TSP was treated the same as a Roth IRA and followed similar rules. I assumed the IRS limits for a Roth IRA applied to the TSP as well. After reading a bit more about the TSP and its contribution limits, I realized that may not be the case. TSP.gov only mentions a total limit across both the traditional TSP and Roth TSP, and never actually said the Roth TSP was limited. 

This led me to a few questions I haven't been able to find answers for. Is there a contribution limit for the Roth TSP other than the combined limit for both the traditional and Roth TSP? And if the Roth TSP and a Roth IRA are completely separate, can I make contributions to *both*? Does the IRS have any rules against having both of these types of retirement accounts?

All of the articles I've seen online only compare a Roth TSP against a Roth IRA and none of them addressed the idea of having both.

**Tax stuff first**

This year, my wife and I's tax return will be ~ $3,600 (MFJ).  Most of this was due to the purchase of a home and being able to itemize for the first time mortgage interest deductions, property taxes, some student loan interest, etc.  We also both realized we never changed our Federal withholding marriage status to 'Married' and never claimed an exemption, so we changed that about 4ish weeks ago.  **This change netted me around $50 extra on my check** from $1,600 to $1,650.  

Fast forward 2 weeks later...


**TSP Info**

I had been contributing only 6% to TSP but realized the need to increase that in order to plan for a better retirement.  My new years resolution was to double it, so I increased to 12% (excluding agency match).  

I had estimated this would reduce my net pay from $1,650 to around $1,200 on the high side (using some envelope math).  **I just got paid, and I still netted $1,540 *with* the 12% TSP contribution, along with the new withholding!**  The 1% federal pay-raise was also captured on this, too. 


TL;DR - Adjusted withholding in paycheck, doubled TSP contribution, and only ""lost"" a net of $100 on my check.  I suppose this is why you fine folks suggest lowering your taxable income in the first place.  






Edit:  I'm hoping next year to contribute the max ($17,500?) into TSP.  Any guesses as to what I would *net* on my paycheck if I maxed it out?  It'd be about 25% of my income.",finance,1391044760

&gt;Currently, TSP provides for five major funding options:

&gt;Inverse Funds would be the fund asset that helps significantly to level the playing field with Wall Street. For example, if the C fund were to fall in price by 5% over the course of a month, then the inverse fund to it (call it -C, let's say) would rise in price by 5% during the same timeframe. Inverse funds could be created for the F, S, and I funds as well. Profiting from a down market will have a monumental impact on the growth of federal/miltary TSP retirement plans.

We as a community have been featured on websites, local news channels, and even newspapers for doing things that were thought to be impossible. And because of this, we have had a large surge in new shibes discovering and joining the world of doge. 

But there is something that is impeding us from growing at even a higher rate. On many of those news outlets, they have associated dogecoin with bitcoin. While this might not seem bad at first, a quick search on my local news channel's website reveals that for the most part, bitcoin news has generally been negative, while dogecoin news has been positive. Problem is, there is a lot more negative press about bitcoin than there is positive press about dogecoin. This in turn has given the average joe such as my neighbors and parents the idea that for the most part, bitcoin is bad. Don't think so? Well a few days ago, I introduced my parents to dogecoin, and let me tell you something, they were not pleased. They told me that kind of thing is used for illegal crimes, and I shouldn't be using it, which is ridiculous, but it helped me realize thing about mainstream news outlets and the people who use them.

**Most of the people using cable and newspapers aren't open enough to try new things such as dogecoin**

Think about it. how many, out of the hundreds of thousands who saw dogecoin for the first time through their local newspaper or cable channel, actually saw dogecoin as something they would consider. The average joe channel surfing will not see dogecoin as a new way of currency, he will see it as a silly fad that will end over time. So what can we conclude from the paragraphs above?

**We are getting excited about the wrong things**

A majority of Cable subscribers are in the age range of somewhere from 40-75. These people are, for the most part, not going to be interested in a new currency. So when we get all excited about our local news station talking about dogecoin, should we really be so excited? Whats the point in getting excited when a majority of the viewers will be too closed in their ways to use dogecoin? So then what should we be getting excited about?

**Youtube**

Youtube is the next step for dogecoin to get new shibes and reach the moon. Why? Because a majority of the users there are open enough to ideas to at least try them out. For example, the cinnamon challenge. While stupid, by having a lot of popular youtubers do the challenge, they unintentionally support the challenge and now, you have shandkeisha in 9th grade trying the cinammon challenge because she saw a video of Glozell doing the challenge. Now think about it in terms of doge. Lets say someone like Rhett and Link, or Sourcefed do a video about dogecoin. Now you have their audience, mostly 18-25 year olds, looking up dogecoin and potentially joining the community because they are open enough to try it. Thats what we should be getting excited for, because I assure you youtube channels will have a higher percentage of new shibes trying out dogecoin than news or cable.

**What are the next steps then?**

I think the main key to really getting dogecoin some more well-deserved publicity is to get popular channels that have relatively open and tech-savvy users, and tip the living crap out of the and tip them, the more they get exposed to the coin, the more likely they will support it. Another thing we should do is that if you see a post that shows a popular youtuber supporting, or at least showing dogecoin in their video. There was a post of magicofrahat (youtube magician) putting a picture of doge in his vids, and barely anyone noticed! I think if we use youtubers publicity as a means of propulsion to the moon, it will be a more efficient and popular fuel than mainstream news.",cryptocurrency,1391051041

personalfinance,Advice on what to tackle first (NZ),"My partner and I have a child and have never paid much attention to our money but recently I have been focusing on trying to reduce our debt and get us into the positive. I will explain our situation below and would like some advice on whether we should save for a emergency fund first or service our debt.

our combined take home pay each month is 5000    
  
our outgoings are:  
rent = 1400  
power = 120  
water = 40  
cellphone = 200 (this is cheap for NZ and required for work)  
food = 320  
gas = 500  
car insurance = 138  
contents insurance = 40  
gym membership = 90  
Baby stuff (nappies etc) = 120  


Our debts are:  

Personal loan 16,700 @19% - min monthly payment $700  
Credit Card that offers 6 months interest free on purchases over $250 so on this we have the following owing (this card has a minimum $150 monthly payment on it)  
$4778.80 total. Made up of:  
$351.32 @ 0% until 30/april/14 then remaining at 24.95%  
$2,217.35 @0% until 30/may/14 then remaining at 24.95  
$685.55 @0% until 30/june/14 then remaining at 24.95  
$1,491.84 @0% until 28/feb/15  

I was thinking we would be best to pay off the debts at 0% first because they don't have long at that rate then they will have the highest interest rate while paying the minimum onto the personal loan. We don't have an emergency fund at all so would we be best to get a minimal one together say $1000 then focus on the debts?",finance,1391052480
personalfinance,Compound Interest and Roth IRA (Vanguard),"Hello,

I'm 24 years old and just opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard. I deposited $2,000 into it and it has all gone toward the Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund (VFFVX).

I have a couple of questions:

1.) Is investing all of my retirement savings into a target date fund a good idea? I understand I could invest in each individual fund on my own and change the percentages as I get older and avoid the fees, but I'm going for a ""hands-off"" approach here as I have no investing knowledge tbh.

2.) Am I taking advantage of compound interest? I keep reading about Roth IRAs and compound interest, but the only thing I can find related to interest on Vanguard's website is that the 2055 fund I invested in has a ""SEC yield"" of ""1.98% B"", is this something like an interest rate? The distributions for this fund are scheduled annually, am I taking advantage of compound interest still if distributions are done annually?

3.) Should I invest in anything else alongside the target date fund or just stick with that 100%?

Thanks for any assistance!",finance,1391052995

Bipartisan legislation that would delay flood insurance premium hikes for hundreds of thousands of people living in coastal and low-lying areas cleared its first hurdle in the Senate on Monday.

The 86-13 vote demonstrated that the measure had filibuster-proof support in the chamber, which was likely to pass it in a few days.

The legislation would delay for up to four years premium increases set to phase in next year on homeowners facing whopping premium increases under new flood maps and would allow homeowners with subsidized insurance policies to pass them on to people who buy their homes.

The higher premiums were the result of changes made to the federal flood insurance program less than two years ago — widely praised as long-overdue reforms of the program — that were designed to make it more financially stable and bring insurance rates more in line with the real risk of flooding.

The White House Monday evening issued an official policy statement that failed to endorse the legislation. ""Delaying implementation of these reforms would further erode"" the program's financial position, the statement said. But it urged relief for economically distressed policyholders.

But the new rates have caused sticker shock for hundreds of thousands of people who could face big premium jumps as flood maps are updated in coming years. And the loss of subsidies when homes are sold has put a damper on the real estate market and threatened home values. Homeowners are seeing estimates that in many cases would force premium hikes of 10 times or more as their homes are judged to be at greater risk of flooding.

""It's had a significant impact in the flood-prone areas,"" said Ken Baris, a real estate agent in West Orange, N.J. ""There's lots of people who are seeing their equity being eaten up.""

But Egon Kahl, an agent on Long Beach Island in New Jersey, which was hit hard by Superstorm Sandy, said the real estate market there was humming.

Other reforms, including higher premiums for frequently-flooded properties and on 1.7 million second homes would remain in place.

Clearing the first Senate hurdle put the bill on track for Senate action later in the week. Its future in the House was uncertain at best. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, opposes the Senate bill but was holding the door open to a more modest measure that would leave more of the 2012 overhaul in place.

At issue is the federal flood insurance program that was established in 1968 and has incurred big losses, most recently with Sandy in 2012. It is more than $24 billion in debt to taxpayers for losses from big storms like Sandy and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

The 2012 overhaul of the program made several changes to the program, which helps 5.6 million policyholders, 20 percent of whom receive subsidized policies for older homes built before communities joined the flood insurance program. Owners of second homes, frequently-flooded properties and businesses in flood areas would gradually lose their subsidies and pay 25 percent more a year until they reach an actuarially sound rate. Others get to keep their subsidies but can't pass them on when selling their homes.

- Apprehend the fundamental concepts regarding currencies, central banking and monetary policy and the likely implications of digital currency
- Study in depth the issues, challenges, prospects and risks of digital currencies
- Develop a conceptual understanding of the principles and mechanics of digital currency, including cryptography, p2p architecture and public ledgers.
- Comprehend the structure and regulatory environment of the banking, legal and accounting system and the likely implications of digital currencies on bankers, regulators, law enforcement and tax authorities.
- Recognize opportunities to use digital currency for innovation to solve societal problems in finance and society at large.

personalfinance,Car Loan Modification: Should I or Shouldn't I?,"My SO had to have an emergency root canal in November and insurance only paid a small portion of it, so it ended up straining our finances for that month. As a result we ended up missing a car payment on his car. We made the next payment as well as this month's payment, and our intent was to make up the gap when we get our tax refund. 

Our loan is through Suntrust Bank and they sent us an offer to do a car loan modification. They are allowing us to keep our original interest rate, 1.3%, but extend the loan for an additional 3 years. It would lower our payment by 125 dollars a month. 

What I was thinking, if I did the modification, was that we would continue to pay the amount we already pay since it's already budgeted, to save on interest and pay the car off faster. But if there was another emergency, that lower payment would be easier to make and we'd be less likely to miss another payment. Does that make sense?

I guess my question is, is there any reason **not** to take the modification offer? Is there a downside that I'm just overlooking? It almost seems too good to be true.

personalfinance,$90k student loans,"Hi all, I did a search for this but didn't find a conclusive answer.

Here's the deal:

$90k grand total loans (all from sallie mae)
     
$22k loan at 8.5% interest 
     
$18k loan at 8.5% interest 
     
$31k loan at 7.9% interest 
     
$19k loan at 7.9% interest

Total Monthly minimum payment is $1250

These were all borrowed under my parents name but I am paying them off. 
My question is: is there a way to take out a personal loan that can be used to pay off these student loans at a lower interest %? (Credit union or big bank) If so, would I need to explain the situation (paying off student loans that are technically under my parents name) or would I just apply for a personal loan? Also, what amount would be possible to borrow and around what % should I aim for?

I make about $4k a month net (75k gross salary) and have no other expenses other than a $600 car pmt per month. I live with my parents so I don't have any collateral really.
I can afford the monthly minimum on the sallie Mae loans but I don't want to pay 1200 monthly for 10 years. My goal is to knock out these loans in 3 years. A lower interest rate (even with a shorter repayment period) would definitely help!

Banking,"Bank claimed that my cash deposit was short by $1,000, a few days after. How can I prove it? (I only have the receipt of deposit as proof, but bank insisted that I miscounted","Hi r/banking! I think this is the right place to ask this question. OK, so here's my story. I made a deposit of $3,000 cash (some 20, 50 bills) to my bank this past Saturday.  Now, I know we all make mistakes sometimes, but I don't normally handle cash in that amount , so that day when I did, I counted it three times, to make sure the amount was right. I remember perfectly I had 100 $20 bills ($2,000) and 20 $50 bills ($1,000), so total was $3,000. So I knew the amount was right.
I got my receipt from that day (Saturday) stating that amount ($3,000), and today (Thursday), my bank called to inform me that my deposit was short by $1,000.
I came to the branch, and what the rep told me that I miscalculated. She told me that the bank had done their investigation, and they checked the security camera that the amount I gave the teller that day was $2,000 when she fed it to the counting machine. But when I asked to see the video proof, she said that she couldn't show it to me because it was an internal investigation.
So, that's my story. I'm still at the branch right now waiting for the rep to print me a letter or something. But, what are my options? The only proof I have is the deposit receipt that shows the $3,000 cash amount I deposited that day.
I really hope someone here can give me a good advice. Thank you!

PS: location is USA

EDIT: Thank you for all your responses. This is the first time I ever got into this kind of situation with any banks, so really clueless as what options I have to prove other than the receipt. Based on many of the responses here, seems like this receipt is going to be my only line of defense. So, I just secured it in a ziploc bag to preserve it from fading/being torn (used to watch many CSI shows, and that's how they secure their evidence, I think). I'll post an update here tomorrow.

EDIT: 1/31/14 - [UPDATE]
Went to the branch today to get the latest update on this case. Waited for almost an hour for the Service Manager that called me yesterday, but the greeter said that she was in conference call, and she never showed up to meet me. Then, the Branch Manager walked up to me and said that they haven't heard any news from the investigative team, so they won't deduct my balance.
I just hope that they won't ""reactivate"" this dispute out of nowhere in the future. I don't know if there is any statutes of limitations in the US Banking Law regarding this kind of cases, but so far it doesn't seem like they have a strong case to prove it otherwise",finance,1391102338

dogecoin,THEM4CHIN3's dogecoin out look. Very generosity= much value. (A long article on my thoughts and position on dogecoin),"Ok so before I start writing as if I know half of what I am talking about let me take this time to assert that I know little about financial things basically enough to pay my bills, strategize about when you save and when I can spend my money and to not get taken for a ride by a money scam, that's the extent of my money knowledge. In fact I am a mechanic/mechanical engineering student and basically a full time pizza delivery guy.










While it may be perceived to be a giant digital circle jerk,I must commend all shibes rich or poor on the overwhelming generosity that has been done in this community. Either to each other or to large goals. I consider myself a generous person and even more so when compared to the internet's level of negativity but crypto currency aside if this community was judged according to users""niceness"" of comments I think you would be very hard pressed to find another community so actually helpful to each other to achieve a common goal, that goal of course is to get to the moon. A phrase that my wife is quickly getting sick of.
There are two major side benefits to this epidemic of generosity that I have concluded.











The first benefit is exposure.
At the time OF writing this we have helped send in no small way athletes to the winter Olympics! It is very hard to ignore that level of generosity! Especially when you consider the donations of dogecoin that were mined and squeezed out of numerous CPU'S and GPU'S and even a few smart phones as well.
This was currency that while not earned in traditional methods of labor or in a physical sense of work, were rather earned through a shibe who rather then play their favorite PC game decided instead to run Cg or Cpminer to enter a pool with another shibe who if not mining for Dogecoin would be entirely a stranger and May have also made a similar decision. Even you shibes with your dedicated mining rigs sporting three or more 100GB GPU'S that are so powerful they actually can fix all the bugs in Battlefield 4. One user yesterday posted images of the hardware he was going to use to build a dedicated mining rig,I asked him how much it all cost him as I myself would love to have a similar setup to mine away at speeds that the universe moves in to donate huge portions to every major drive for charity. He replied saying all together it cost him $1700. He payed $1700 for equipment to acquire a currency that has no real physical sense, is almost entirely UN accepted at every merchant and has a fluctuating value below a USD cent. However when that machine goes online And begins solving blocks at hash speeds my hp laptop couldn't even theorize about and the  dogecoins start rolling in imagine the generosity that it is capable of giving to that user, in essence that user made a small $1700 investment in the generosity of or community and any charity or philanthropic goal we have. 









The second is value
I believe the coin cap is set at 100 billion coins.there will only ever be this many confirmed dogecoin in existence. When we begin to near that ceiling expect it to be quite high in value in comparison  to dogecoin's value right now. I don't think this is a new concept to any shibes, it's simple car buying and selling theory. The more rare or hard to find a car is the more theoretical value it has but also less potential buyers. Of course the latter element doesn't apply to a currency; crypto or otherwise. Our community's generosity has also greatly impacted and improved the value of dogecoin and also has helped give us a steady, healthy thrust instead of a rampant UN controllable take off that runs out of fuel and falls back to kerbin...I mean crashes and looses all value. As we mine for the currency the availability of it diminishes very very very VERY slowly BUT rather then every user just consume and pile up the coin we spread it out, and give to those new shibes who have joined us on the launch pad, or give/tip to those users that know how to make doge images in their comments to posts (I WANT TO DO THAT TOO) Or tip the new shibe who has no clue how to mine or what to even search for (me in the beginning) imagine if these same exact generosities were happening with USD or your country's currency in the streets? I know at least in my country (Good ole well intention-ed but obnoxious and kind of a dick, MERICUH') it would help allot of people out paying bills and debts and increase the overall value and worth because of it. We must never EVER stop spreading the DOGE. Not only because of value reasons but because it is this communities UN-official ""salute"" to tip others. to look at it from the opposite side of the spectrum, if this community did not have such a high standard of generosity and did not donate or tip this currency would have went no where as new users would have been far too intimidated to join and mine, leaving a select few of the determined and already equipped to mine in seclusion and pile up useless code. Imagine this community without its level of giving and tell me if you still also see it have the value it does now. 
Now I don't want to come off as illogical, despite our rampant generosity we are all in the mines to eventually make wealth.when we mine we are all investing time and those of us who pay an electric and internet Bill the cost of those as well into a long-term pay out. 









We may never reach the level of value that bit coin has, and honestly that's perfectly fine to me since I'm not into bit coin, nothing against it of course as it paved the way for us shibes but for me that rocket launched a long time ago. I don't have a pile of Dogecoin saved up and I never intended to. I've never been big on becoming rich with USD either and to be completely honest I hate the concept of traditional money as it is and feel the human race would be better off without it but that's just not the world we live in.
I read comments in a thread recently that other shibe discussed what they hoped dogecoin would reach in value and I personally feel a $1 to D1 value would be a reasonably attainable goal of course I intend to hold out as long as possible. If it goes higher then that's stellar especially for charities and donation goals as they would get the best benefit of such a value.even more so for those countries where the dollar is very high in value compared to the countries own currency.any projects, or charities that benefit a third our second world country especially investing in infrastructure I am most winning to donate to.  I feel this also help increase or currencies value as well, but that's just my guess. Basically anything has the potential to increase our coins value.
Our currency and essentially all other currencies are based on faith, we BELIEVE in the value of it and as the number of shibes goes up so does the faith in its value and it's exposure along with it where merchants also become more aware and see it's value and will begin to accept it. Of course though the market value will always fluctuate and at Times be low and others be high; all currencies have this. Every time the value in doge coin drops a bit there is always the post in this sub reddit telling everyone to not sell and to not be scared or think it's a crash.
If you give in to that value drop fear and panic sell then your giving up your faith in the doge and our fellow shibe's generosity.












You are also and most importantly giving up your share of Dogecoin's future value! 
I remember when bit coin was in its infancy and very low In value and at the time I had the thought of buying a good chunk of bit coin, but I decided that it would be money best spent on other things I needed at the time and I did not feel as though bit coin would go anywhere in value and in essence had no faith in it.I think we can all agree that did not work in my favor. This time around though I will follow dogecoin to the end of our solar system and back,I am dedicated to it and have faith in its success both in value and it's ability to help others through charities and donations.  











In closing this frackin' novel I have written existing my position on the doge coin, to which I am genuinely sorry and surprised you actually read through, if you happen to live in south Carolina , and east of Columbia and one night you have a hunger for pizza hut, you should know that as a delivery driver who is paying off a student loan to get back into class with federal funding aid, I do accept doge coin and plan on having some business cards made with an address to tip me how ever many dogecoins you feel my service warranted. I look forward to the day I am paid for engine rebuilds and race engine builds with doge coin and I can buy all the car parts in my amazon cart with dogecoin.










As always TO THE MOON!

dogecoin,Why you should switch to a small pool.,"When I first started mining doge I mined with a big pool (dogehouse) and found myself unhappy with it. There was no person to person communication with the people at dogehouse. They were unhelpful with setting up my miners. Then I felt like it was time to quit. I later found out that big pools are bad because having one entity control a major portion of the network can lead to corruption. 

 I was talking to my friend in skype(he got me into doge) he told me about the great luck he was having with smaller pools. He said that they were really helpful with new users. He also said that they have better up times because they are not being bogged down by thousands of people. I made the switch to a small pool (stablehash.com) and could not be more happy! They helped me setup cudaminer on my other computers so I could mine. 

The only really bad thing about the smaller pools is that the payouts are bigger but less frequent. 

Overall I could not be more happy with stablehash and I recommend it to everyone who is fed up with their current pool. I am so happy to have switched to stablehash I cannot tell you!",cryptocurrency,1391104750

We both filed a 2 withholding on our taxes as we have for the last 5 years but it used to not hurt as much since we were super broke starting out making about $20-30K, maybe. Now that we both are making more of a regular working income we have had some tax increases.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin holdings, hedging and leverage - thoughts on what is needed next ...","(At least) three developments are needed for bitcoin or a successor cryptocurrency:

Bitcoin Holdings: Although Overstock's Byrne retracted his recent statement that Overstock will not hold bitcoin, he underscored a significant issue. As long as companies feel compelled to convert bitcoin to USD to ""eliminate risk"" they will reinforce the sentiment that bitcoin is too volatile to hold as a store of value. The oft-cited savings in transaction costs relative to credit cards will pale in comparison to fiat exchange rate fluctuations, meaning the real utility of bitcoin will be limited to reducing the costs associated with cross border transfers and to conducting transactions in which relative anonymity is desired. This needs to change.

Bitcoin Hedging: Companies that conduct business in non-domestic currency often hedge their exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. Simple mechanisms to do this in bitcoin, in order to encourage a bitcoin economy, are needed until bitcoin becomes so widely accepted and stable in terms of purchasing power (and not in terms of fiat exchange rates, although they are related) that it will be of interest to routinely convert fiat to bitcoin (!). My current understanding of ethereum, with its notion of flexible contracts, is that it represents a step in that direction.

Bitcoin Leverage (thank you JJ for pointing this out): - Banks leverage their deposits to create loans in a highly regulated, centralized (Fed) environment. Is there a way to craft the equivalent in the decentralized, unregulated bitcoin space? To enable lending?",cryptocurrency,1391129493

I have two (not full time) jobs, one through school and the other off campus.  I've only gotten my school W-2 so far, where I have earned $2769 ($128 fed withheld, $29 state).  My second job should be significantly less than $2769.  I was under the impression that I had to file, so I went ahead with the free TurboTax stuff and went as far ahead as I could with the tax forms that I had.

I also have a 1098-T form that they asked for, and that's where I'm confused.  When I filled in my 1098-T form, TurboTax showed me owing a few hundred dollars to federal.. so I'm wondering if this is correct or not.  My amounts billed/qualified expenses (box 2) is $10970, while my scholarships and grants (box 5) equals $21315.  I did get a refund check for my own personal use, so I'm assuming that the extra $10k is considered taxable since it's not qualified.  However, I checked back on my previous 1098-T and the forms have me having more scholarship/grant than I am billed like this year (although the past year haven't been $10k, more like $5k-ish in refund)

In 1963, Sarawak, a Nation in the Island of Borneo, was an Independent nation, having gained its independence from British (UK) Colonial rule, only to be tricked into partnership by Malaya Government to form Malaysia together with Singapore and North Borneo (Sabah) to form Malaysia.

There was a pretext by both the UK Government and the then Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who promised security and prosperity for Sarawak if they join the formation of Malaysia as an equal partners to Independence. Unwillingly, many of the Sarawak past leaders who were mostly lowly educated and illiterate were tricked into believing and agreeing to Malaysia's formation. There was no proper Referendum conducted before the declaration to the formation of Malaysia, but merely an Inquiry done known as the Cobbold Commision initiated by the United Kingdom Government. Malaysia was announced formed on 16 September 1963, with Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah as Equal Partners. Singapore declared itself a Republic later and has since then prospered to be one of the richest country in the world.

Since then, Sarawak which is rich in Oil &amp; Gas as well as abundance natural resources has been fleeced of its income by Federal Malaya, with minimal return give for its infrastructural development; and has also been declared one of the two poorest States in Malaysia, including its neighboring Borneo state of Sabah.

We are seeking to pursue our call for a National referendum through the United Nations and possibly through the International Court of Justice to recover our losses and regain our Nationhood  over the last 50 years of so called Independence through Malaysia. 

We have formed a movement called the Sarawak Sovereignty Movement, pursuing a Civil Action and Peaceful means to achieve a referendum by the Year 2016. We need support of all especially the International Community to help us realize this important milestone in our quest for an Independent Sarawak Nation, for freedom, equality and justice for our population which comprises of more than 30 different racial groups of Borneo. 

The present racist regime at the helm of the Federal Government and its support for Islamic Zealotism i.e over the controversial issue of using the name of God Allah, is a big worrying factors for our Sarawak and Sabah populations, who are mainly Christians, who have in the past been living harmoniously with others, be they Muslims, Buddhists or Atheists.

I can actually go 2-3 minutes without getting a new key request now! I'll take this post down in an hour or so, but will **keep all your keys saved** so when the new version launches, you can re-use your old key instead of requesting a new one (so don't delete the mail just yet)!

The next major release / post will likely be over this weekend with a bunch of improvements that all of you suggested!

---

###Update 6: Made some more keys.

Since I still keep getting about 2-3 messages every 30 seconds, I'll try to work through the key backlog so everyone gets a chance to give it a look. If it's been more than four hours since your key request and you haven't gotten one, delete your old comment and post a new one! I'm having a hard time keeping up, hahah. Payouts will still go through as planned!

---

###Update 5: Out of keys! 

I backed up the database and will go through it over the course of the day (after getting some sleep) to make sure everyone who played so far gets their payouts properly, no matter how big or small. I have a few failed tips in the Doge Tip Bot history already (even though the balance is there), so I want to make sure nobody ends up disappointed!

Existing keys can still be reset, so I'll work through those requests as soon as I can!

---

###Update 4: Waiting on my account balance

... to see If I have any Doge left. I'll give out a few more keys, but all in all this was a fantastic first test. Stay tuned, and thank you to all the ones who gave feedback on how to improve it! You're all very awesome!

###Update 3: Uh oh. I'm starting to run out of keys. 

If you didn't get one in an hour from now, don't worry! I'll put this back up after making some changes to the engine and automating some things that are making my arms very sore right now.

You get to pick one of several dragon types and go on raiding adventures (there's a Doge one too)! Depending on how well you do (and how lucky you are!) you get a **Dogecoin payout** based on how much gold you amassed, and if you died in combat or voluntarily retired. For a Loss it's 1/2 Dogecoin per 10 Gold, for a Retirement 1 Doge per 10 Gold (one specific dragon type gets a 50% bonus to the latter). I'll keep giving out tickets until 10k are gone (this includes bug bounties, see below!).

###How to play!

---

1. Post a comment below to get your own free key as a PM! **Keep your key private, as it grants you access to your character for as long as they're active!**

2. Go to the [Site](http://www.dogequest.com) -&gt; Play -&gt; copy &amp; paste your key!

###Quick ""Beginner's Guide""!

---

* High rolls are good, low rolls are bad. This applies throughout the entire game.

* The **Flame** dragon and **Swamp** dragon make good starter races. Flames get a +10 Terror Aura spell bonus, which makes it incredibly rare to die during Cave explorations (and impossible to fail them with Recovery Shards). Swamp dragons get the same bonus from their initial Recovery Shard as a buffed Terror Aura, though only until their first failure.

* Start out by exploring the Caves. If you die on your very first day and have no gold accumulated, you will be **revived with a second chance** (this doesn't apply to the Inu Draconi race, since they start with 200g).

* Use the Third Eye spell as a ""safe"" means of accumulating Relics. While the spell can (rarely) fizzle, you don't risk dying either. Disciples can outright *pile up* Runes and Shards this way due to their racial bonus.

* The Third Eye spell is the only one that can fail, and is unaffected by any other boosts.

* Recovery Shards act like emergency parachutes; one will fire on a failure event whether or not they actually end up saving you. If you rolled an 11 in the Cave, it will tack the +5 bonus on and turn it into a success; if you rolled a 10, the bonus applies as well, but you're still 1 short of avoiding death with 15.

* If you have both a Recovery Shard and the Wingmother's Lifeguard spell active, the spell will *only* trigger if the Recovery Shard fails to save you. You will still burn the Shard in either case, but this prevents you from wasting the (rather expensive) spell.

Perfect! Either post the error in the comments here or PM it to me! If it's something severely game breaking, I'll give you a Doge bounty for it.

###FAQ! ^(will add more questions as they arise)

---

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *""Can I play multiple times?""*

&gt;&gt;Sure! Just respond to my key confirmation reply to your comment and I'll reset yours within a few minutes. Please don't farm it though, make sure others can get some too!


&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *""Why's there an ad on the intro page!""*

&gt;&gt;I put it there for those who can't donate anything as a way to support it. Click on the ad if you want to help out, it lets me pay for the bandwidth and payout pool! The game itself is absolutely ad free though (I don't really like ads either).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *""Are you making a profit off this?""*

&gt;&gt;Nope! Any donation amounts coming in will go right back to the prize pool for payouts. This is just a fun way to give back!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *""Do you have more features planned?""*

&gt;&gt;Definitely! This is an early framework that I can build on, and the way it's designed leaves it modular enough to easily expand.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *""Are payouts automatic?""*

&gt;&gt;Nope, they're manual right now, but I'm testing automatic payouts internally! I'll be going through the backlog (if any) whenever I'm around my computer, so I apologize in advance if they take a bit.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; *""Are the dice rolls really random?""*

&gt;&gt;Yep! All rolls are based on [mt_rand](http://us1.php.net/mt_rand) with a newly generated seed per player.

personalfinance,How will college savings impact eligibility for Federal financial aid/grants?,"I'm looking to start saving some money for my cousin. His family is low-income (no assets, currently on disability and SNAP.) I'm almost positive he would qualify for the maximum grants from the federal government if he meets the academic requirements. He's also heavily involved in sports, so that might be another pathway for him as well, but it's still too early to say. 

So if hypothetically I were to set up some kind of 529 college savings, will it penalize him or change his eligibility? As an example, he uses the savings to pay for parts of his tuition in the first and second year of school. He also works part-time/summers, while in school. In that case, he wouldn't be a student from a poor family with $0 income, he would be a student with $20,000-30,000 in income and even having some savings...etc. 

*I have about six years to save this money. Probably will set aside [$150-200 a month](http://www.savingforcollege.com/college-savings-calculator/index.php?current_cost=13500&amp;years_until_college=6&amp;years_attendance=4&amp;attendance_rate=100&amp;coverage_rate=25&amp;save_until=ends&amp;starting_balance=0&amp;contribution_rate=12&amp;inflation_rate=5&amp;investment_performance=6&amp;page=graphs) into something like a 529 investment plan. So it won't come close to paying for all of his tuition. It would be more of a supplement to his grants and loans. 

example with today's dollars:

* 2011–2012 award years, the maximum amount was $5,645

* In-State tuition/living at home: ~$14,000 + books and food

Bitcoin,I wrote an academic paper on Bitcoin for a sociology journal,"Long time lurker, first time poster in this subreddit. I have written a paper on some of the more sociologically interesting aspects of Bitcoin, and would be interested to hear if the community had any opinions on it.

If you happen to have institutional access to the small Danish sociology journal *Distinktion* you can read a nicely formatted and proofread version [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1600910X.2013.870083), if not you can read my ass-ugly Word version at [my personal web page](http://henrikkarlstrom.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/virtual-money.pdf).

The TL:DR for the paper - which I realise is probably a bit heavy on the sociological theory, sorry about that - is that I consider Bitcoin to be an exciting and novel technological innovation that will have consequences in the way electronic transactions are handled in the future, but also that I don't think Bitcoin is a revolutionary new way of doing monetary policy, like a lot of people seem to assume. As a sociologist, I see markets as something more than a technical-economic question. They are also tied to a lot of institutions and ways of doing things which are far stickier than they seem. For example, I don't think people will be ready to accept a world where they are themselves personally responsible for keeping their money safe from theft or tampering. There are lots of ""old"" economic institutions that will get involved to make Bitcoin look a lot more like traditional currencies as it becomes more popular - and that includes types of regulation that does not appeal so much to the libertarians that originally designed it. Phew, that's a long TL:DR...

Oh, and if you see something in here that isn't correct, you're probably right. A couple of points in my defence:

1) The way academic publishing works, getting a paper out takes a long time. Given that things in Bitcoinland are developing extremely fast, a lot of the information in here is already outdated.

2) This is written for an audience that don't necessarily know anything about Bitcoin. Also, I'm neither an economist nor a computer scientist, so I'm sure there are mistakes in the technical descriptions here -  I already see there are things I would have worded differently if I could rewrite it. I'm posting it here so you guys can understand something about what a sociologist sees when looking at something like Bitcoin.

personalfinance,"Reddit, my wife and I need help figuring out what to do with our debt! Details inside...","Long story short, my wife and I have accumulated a fairly large amount of debt over the past 5 years and were FINALLY at the point where we are paying down our debt. However, we basically pay just a smidge above minimum payment on most items and on others we have called to lower the payments.

With that said, I would very much appreciate some guidance on paying down our debt. Below is a very crudely formatted table of our debt:


Creditor | Balance | Rate | Monthly Pmt.
:--|--:|--:|--:
Credit Card 1 | 2,278.62 | 21.55% | 130.00 
Credit Card 2 | 1,639.40 | 20.99% | 100.00 
Credit Card 3 | 3,926.22 | 14.24% | 180.00 
Credit Card 4 | 3,715.15 | 11.99% | 80.00 
Car 1 | 3,121.50 | 8.79% | 270.00 
Car 2 | 2,624.26 | 12.19% | 260.00
Wife Private Student Loan | 1,145.13 | 8.75% | 100.00 
Wife Federal Student Loan | 646.06 | 2.35% | 25.00 
My Dept. of Edu. Loan 1 | 1,115.45 | 6.20% | 60.00 
My Dept. of Edu. Loan 2 | 3,455.30 | 5.60% | 40.00

    
If it helps, below I have outlined a few details:

- We normally have about $300 leftover every month after everything is paid (includes grocery, gas, entertainment, etc).
- I've managed to save $1050 for a new laptop, but after mulling it over for the past few weeks I decided that I no longer want it so now I have that to put towards debt.

Thanks everyone in advance!",finance,1391203861

personalfinance,Need help with my student loan/cc debt payback plan,"So I basically lived off of loans/scholarships/grants/credit cards (with part time jobs) in my six years of undergrad/graduate school without really any regard to what I was doing. My credit cards are maxed out at 4k and I have 36k in student loans. 

This January, I started a 40k a year job and finally started to look at what I could do to get out of debt. My pay varies based on the number of days in the month, but I'm looking at around $2400 a month. 

I put $1200 in a shared account with my boyfriend for rent, utilities, food, fun stuff, gas, whatever. I pay my car insurance, $46 a month and the rest I'm planning on putting toward savings and debt. 

I don't have to pay back my loans until June, so I'm focusing on credit card debt until then. $500 a month to each card, so that will get taken care of by the time I have to start paying back my student loans. $200 a month into savings, although the joint account with my boyfriend has about 8k in savings, I want to start my own for whatever. 

I have 9 student loans, all varying amounts, all stafford loans owned by the government with interest rates between 4% and 6.8%. Should I focus on the lower ones to get rid of the sheer number (daunting to me) or the ones with the higher interest rates (which happen to be the most expensive loans)? Disperse evenly?

And the worst part: I looked up my score on credit karma to find a staggeringly low 571 score. I was shocked as I've never been behind on a payment and got my trans union credit report to find out more. It states I am two payments late on a loan that does not show up on myfedloan.org or the Chase account that would have originally owned the loan, which still doesn't make sense as I am in grace period for my loans. The second is a bill that is in collections from a Next Care hospital visit from August 2011. I know for a fact that I paid this in June 2012 because I went to another Next Care with a kidney infect and they wouldn't treat me until I paid it, though nobody mentioned anything about collections, though I do think the lady was a little weird about it but I thought she was just embarrassed that she had to ask me to pay first. Nobody has ever tried to contact me about either of these, which seems suspicious to me. I would love advice on how to get them off of my credit report.",finance,1391211783
