personalfinance,MyRA Seems Like An Unusually Terrible Idea,"Seems like a total death trap with the massive interest rate risk. On top of it being such a tiny amount that it would likely do very little good to the saver. One also could simply open a roth IRA and buy the same government bonds and do their future tax liability a huge favor.

Someone making that little, equities would seem to be their only real hope of having some kind of decent retirement. Perfectly doable even with very little money.

I'm thinking Monday is gonna be at least as bad as today in terms of the Dow and S&amp;P. Reasons for that are strengthening USD as a result of emerging markets becoming unstable, fear of overpriced equities because the Fed is continuing the taper, and the already great amounts of volatility as measured by the VIX index and the ETFs that follow it.

Bitcoin,A bitcoin article I am writing for my school,"Hey guys, I am writing an article on bitcoins for my school's weekly market report. I want some feedback before I send it off to the editor:



There is a famous problem in computer science known as the Byzantine Generals Problem (or the Two Generals Problem) first posed in 1975. Imagine a situation where two generals have to coordinate an attack on a city, and the only way to successfully make the attack is by simultaneously attack the city via sending messengers through the city. The problem arises if the messengers are captured by the city, causing the two generals to either not receive the correct message no matter how many messengers are sent by either side. 

In 2009, a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious online identity who introduced the bitcoin protocol to the internet. The way the bitcoin protocol tries to solve this problem is by introducing a Distributed Consensus Asset Ledger in which all of the involved parties reach consensus on the balance of bitcoins via solving a complex mathematical problem, known as Proof-of-Work, and distributing the solution to everyone else in the network. Once a correct solution has been found, that solution becomes integrated into the Proof-of-Work, and subsequent solutions to this problem must incorporate the solutions that came before it. This way, people in the network reaches consensus not through direct communication, but through simple rules and mathematics. As more proofs (or blocks) are added, the problem increases in both difficulty and the computational power required, meaning it would be very hard for any one party to subvert the integrity of the system. Every 10 minutes, the system generates a certain number bitcoins and awards it to the party first able to find the correct proof to the block, after which the process repeats itself. The number of bitcoins is not infinite however; a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins is set, and the number of bitcoins awarded decreases in relations to how fast and difficult the solutions are being churned out. 

Once a person has bitcoins, he or she can use it to trade for goods and services. Initially, people bartered bitcoins with each other for goods, settling loans, etc. The first major trading platform for bitcoins is Silk Road, an anonymous black market for trafficking weapons, drugs, and other illicit activities. Silk Road was subsequently shut down by the American federal government in October of 2013 with the arrest of the head Silk Road moderator and the seizure of nearly 30 000 bitcoins (today worth approximately 25 million USD. However, there are other legitimate businesses who are dealing with bitcoins. Overstock, and most recently TigerDirect, has announced they are willing to accept bitcoins as a means of payment. In its first 24 hours since making the announcement, Overstock, an online shopping platform, reported $130 000 in bitcoin sales. A variety of smaller local businesses (bars, hair salons, shops, etc) have also introduced bitcoins as a means of payment. 

At the start of 2013, the price of a bitcoin hovered just above $10 USD, but fueled by Chinese investors near the end of the year this number jumped to $1 000 USD, peaking at $1 200 USD. The price volatility strikes concerns for potential investors and regulators who fear of a bubble burst. In December 2013, the Chinese government placed strict restrictions on buying bitcoins with the Yuan, although this control has recently been loosened, allowing people to use the Yuan to buy bitcoins again. In America, there have been important hearings by the Fed and the NY Banking Regulation on bitcoin. Right now, the policy is more of a wait-and-see situation, as regulators are beginning to sense bitcoins as a potentially powerful and revolutionary tool capable of boosting the economy. Other countries are also paying attention to how dominant players such as US and China are approaching bitcoins in terms of regulations. 

Why should anyone use bitcoins? Perhaps that is the million dollar question right now. One very real avenue people can use bitcoin is transferring wealth across borders. Currently, exchanging one currency to another involves a lot of fees. With bitcoin, however, one can use it as an intermediary between two currencies. This means, as long as someone is willing to trade bitcoin for their local currency, one could make the exchange regardless of what the price of bitcoin is. Another reason to adopt bitcoin is its safety feature. Holding bitcoins is very much like using debit and credit cards; however, all transactions are irreversible and there are no institutions setting withdrawal limits on accounts. This means for retailers, they are guaranteed to receive their money almost instantly, no matter how large the transaction is. Perhaps what is most striking is the economics behind bitcoins. Since the number of bitcoins is more or less set in any given time and prices are generally stable, speculations aside, the value of bitcoins could be driven by how fast it is being exchanged for goods and services. As a simple analogy, if an object is used to trade one good for another, that object is more valuable if the goods are traded 10 times than it is if they are only traded once in the same time period. If people simply hold onto bitcoins and do not use them for trade, it is obvious that the bitcoins would not be as valuable to people in the real world. Of course, this would depend on how well the global economy is doing.

personalfinance,Back for a little more Budgeting Advice,"First of all, I want to thank everyone that helped me in my last thread.

http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1vubas/need_some_advice_moving_forward_credit/

I sent the 23k in to my auto loan yesterday to pay off my car and put the other 5k in my savings account.  I also paid off all my credit cards last month (maybe $1kish so I can start February with zero debt.)

I have gone through my last 2.5 months or so of transactions and identifed TONS of leaks (ie going to Mickey D's too many times when I already have the necessary breakfast components in the fridge or buying that Coke Zero at the gas station when I'm buying gas instead of picking up a 6 pack at Meijer). 

This is my rough draft budget plan for the month of February.

http://i.imgur.com/MqCKSB1.jpg

February will actually be easier on the bills than budgeted.  Since my net income is actually $550 per wk. I set it up at $500 per week since my 401k deductions and Life Insurance deductions won't be deducted from my paycheck until April 1st, but I wanted to start planning ""lean"".  Phone bill allocated for $45 has already been paid for February and March (I switched carriers and dropped my bill $30 a month) so that is another $45 this month of ""extra money"".  Once again, I wanted the cell phone bill on there so I got used to seeing and planning for it.

Does the budget look good for a single male?   I think I have all the bills covered (rent/electric/cable/internet/cellphone) and did my best to think of all the incidentals from week to week.  I did spend a TON of money the past couple of months because when I separated from the military I didn't own anything but some clothes, books and a computer really :).  I've basically had to furnish an apartment from scratch.  That's almost done though.  

I didn't know if I was budgeting too much/too little into entertainment or not...but that is for drinks on a Friday night, or a movie or a game or what not.

Finally, IF this budget is good and obtainable...it seems that I'll have an extra $500 a month to sock away.  I suppose that's where I should be looking at a Vanguard IRA or should I try to fatten the emergency fund to 10k first?",finance,1391237312

dogecoin,Of Wolves And Weasels - Day 25 - With A Little Help From Our Friends,"Hey All, GoodShibe here!

I like starting off with good things, don't you?  Well, here's something great!  Remember [that thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wgvgz/we_tried_to_donate_25k_doge_yesterday/) I put up a couple of days ago, asking for donations for Bell Let's Talk (even though we missed the day and probably wouldn't get any coverage for it) - well, together we raised 80,000 DOGE - which /u/Moolah_ added 100K - which meant that we raised about $268.71 USD.  Well, as it turns out, /u/Moolah_ wasn't done yet - so they rounded it up to an even $1000 and donated it on /r/Dogecoin's behalf to The Canadian Association of Mental Health.  You can see the receipt [here](https://moolah.ch/files/taxReceipt.pdf).  So, let's give all the generous shibes who contributed to this effort, a sound round of ap-paws (yeah, I said it...).  

Well done!

As it turns out [yesterday's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wn6sj/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_24_100_billion_coins/) caused quite a bit of discussion - lots of passionate shibes coming out to discuss where we're going, how we see our coin -- and even our community -- evolving over time.

I think it's a fantastic thing that we can have these kinds of discussions openly, and that, even when we may not always agree with one another, we do try to see eye to eye and understand where each shibe is coming from.  I have to admit that then I first posted my article, I was somewhat ambivalent about either side of the issue -- and I worked to keep my language neutral as I could.  Explain the facts, try to explain how it might effect us all, and some ideas on how it might be fixed.  Over the course of the discussion that followed, I found myself being swayed by the arguments toward the coin moving in an 'inflationary' direction.  I say this now, publicly, not in an attempt to sway you, but to acknowledge a bias that's started to form toward one direction.

I believe that it's through understanding my own biases that I can work to try and keep an even keel, try and stay neutral until the facts clearly point toward a direction.  In acknowledging such a bias, it encourages me to look THAT much harder at the other arguments against it.  Look for arguments that weaken said bias.  I want to make sure that I'm not just 'believing' something to be true, I want the facts to support said belief structure.  So, by stating this, I want you to know where I'm at on this issue, that I'm looking into the benefits and flaws of both a 'Deflationary' and 'Inflationary' coin.  Trying to wrap my head around it properly so that if I do end up supporting one direction, I know why and can state it clearly.  

That said, I still believe that there are ways to meet in the middle -- I have no idea what they are just yet -- but we have a whole year or more to find a way to come up with a solution with calm, rational discussion on all sides.

Moving on to more fun news - and thank you for bearing with me - we've got some fantastic community efforts underway that I want to take a moment to hightlight:

Democratic Underground censored this article - they don't want the sunlight in.
You can read the replies to it here
http://www.democraticunderground.com/10023301982

Saying the NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are to do with counter terrorism is an obvious and blatant complete pack of lies

The NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are extremely ineffective at stopping terrorist plots - see Boston.

They are VERY effective at building a surveillance dossier on EVERY American to suppress any future political dissent - see Stasi.


The terrorists and Islamic Extremists have known for many years that the US is monitoring and collecting all phone traffic.

In places like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen the Islamists have switched to using walkie-talkies - NOT mobile phones.

If for any reason they do have to make a phone call about operations, like Bin Laden they will use a courier to make the call at least 100 miles away from their base of operations and be careful to avoid the code words that might alert the NSA.
Lists of code words the NSA monitors for, are widely available on the net.

Similarly the Islamic Extremists in America or Europe use anonymous Pay as You Go phones and change them every 2 or 3 months, to avoid detection and any history being collected by the NSA.

All of the Islamists know that all regular internet communications are being monitored - so they don't use them if they don't want the NSA to find out.
They use specialist sites that are not indexed by Google etc.

ALL of the data collection and phone monitoring performed by the NSA is totally ineffective against terrorists and Islamic Extremists. They already knew about the Mass Surveillance programs - at least from 2005/2006. See 1

The only thing the NSA Mass Surveillance programs are effective for is to build a surveillance dossier on all LAW ABIDING citizens.
The NSA are collecting as much data on everyone as possible.
The purpose of which is for future blackmail and intimidation on political dissidents or people the government wants to control. See 2


The NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are an existential threat to democracy in America.
See 3

Together with the other abuses of civil rights all the infrastructure is now in place for an authoritarian Fascist Police State in America.
Whether you think this President or some future President will abuse these powers is immaterial.
See 4.

All law abiding citizens are also being monitored in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well - so it's a threat to democracy in those countries too.
These five countries all share the spy data collected with each other, to get around any privacy rules on spying on their own citizens.
The program is called Five Eyes. See 5

Germany and France are also spying on their own law abiding citizens, but to a lesser extent.

Everything You Wanted to Know about NSA Spying … But Were Afraid to Ask 

Spying: The Big Picture

If you’ve been too busy to keep up with the spying scandal, here’s an overview:
The government is spying on virtually everything we do
The government’s mass spying doesn’t keep us safe
NSA spying did not prevent a terror attack on Wall Street
There is no meaningful oversight of the spying programs by either Congress or the courts
We can keep everyone safe without violating the Constitution … more cheaply and efficiently than the current system
The top counter-terrorism Czar under Clinton and Bush says that revealing NSA spying programs does not harm national security
Whistleblowers on illegal spying have no “legal” way to get the information out
A high-level intelligence source says “we hack everyone everywhere”
Some people make a lot of money off of mass spying
Spying started before 9/11 … and may have stemmed from an emergency program only meant to be activated in the case of a nuclear war
Governments and big corporations are doing everything they can to destroy anonymity
Mass spying creates an easy mark for hackers
Polls show that the public doesn’t believe the NSA
Surveillance can be used to frame you if someone in government happens to take a dislike to you
An NSA whistleblower says that the NSA is spying on – and blackmailing – top government officials and military officers (and see this)

Appendices

1. U.S. Surveillance Is NOT Aimed at Terrorists | Bloomberg 
The debate over the U.S. government’s monitoring of digital communications suggests that Americans are willing to allow it as long as it is genuinely targeted at terrorists. What they fail to realize is that the surveillance systems are best suited for gathering information on law-abiding citizens. (emphasis mine)

People concerned with online privacy tend to calm down when told that the government can record their calls or read their e-mail only under special circumstances and with proper court orders. The assumption is that they have nothing to worry about unless they are terrorists or correspond with the wrong people.

The infrastructure set up by the National Security Agency, however, may only be good for gathering information on the stupidest, lowest-ranking of terrorists. The Prism surveillance program focuses on access to the servers of America’s largest Internet companies, which support such popular services as Skype, Gmail and iCloud. These are not the services that truly dangerous elements typically use.

......

In a January 2012 report titled “Jihadism on the Web: A Breeding Ground for Jihad in the Modern Age,” the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service drew a convincing picture of an Islamist Web underground centered around “core forums.” These websites are part of the Deep Web, or Undernet, the multitude of online resources not indexed by commonly used search engines.

2. The dirty little secret about NSA Mass Surveillance - it's not about counter terror 

Edward Snowden presents hard evidence of the extent and scope of the NSA's Mass Surveillance.
It is reported in the Guardian on June 6th.
Little that is new is revealed by Snowden in this and subsequent articles, except that the NSA's mass internet data collection program is called Prism.
Every potential terrorist and just about every foreign government knew that the NSA was spying on EVERY American and millions more around the world.
Lots of other people knew too.

Glenn Greenwald's first and subsequent articles report that the NSA is indiscriminately collecting phone call data and massive amounts of internet activity on EVERY American.

The only thing that is new is that the world (and Congress) sits up and takes notice.
The scandal causes major embarrassment to members of the US government.

Predictably the US government and the US media try to attack the messenger not the message.
They fail and the scandal grows as more and more people sit up and take notice.

Previous NSA whistle blowers, William Binney, Thomas Drake and J Kirk Wiebe are completely vindicated. They confirm what Snowden is saying.

James Clapper and Dianne Feinstein are caught lying big time.
Clapper's perjury under oath to Congress carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in jail.
See 7.

The NSA Director, General Keith Alexander, is caught lying under oath to Congress 14 times by Hank Johnson.
Each count of perjury carries a maximum sentence of 5 years - 70 years in total. See 8

James Bamford's previous article on the NSA's massive data center, just completed in Utah, is used by Hank Johnson as evidence.

The reason the Utah data center is so massive and has the capacity to store the entire contents of the internet thousands of times over is obvious.
It is required to store massive amounts of surveillance data on EVERY American and millions more around the world.

Amy Goodman's article, from 2012, that the NSA has gone rogue is completely vindicated.
http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/26/how-national-security-agency-gone-rogue

The NSA's justification for their Mass Surveillance activities are completely discredited.
They can cite ZERO examples where a terror plot could not of been foiled without the Patriot Act by obtaining a warrant after finding probable cause.

And they do not need to carry out mass surveillance in order to thwart terrorist plots.

People are very slowly starting to wake up as to the true purpose and implications of the NSA Mass Surveillance programs.
GCHQ revelations: mastery of the internet will mean mastery of everyone | Guardian
http://gu.com/p/3gn8z/tw

The NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are NOT counter terrorism measures for which they are extremely ineffective.
See Boston which was a massive intelligence failure and should of been stopped. See 11

The true purpose of the NSA's Mass Surveillance programs are to blackmail and intimidate in order to suppress political dissent and to control those in government or political rivals.
When someone upsets the government in some way they will become a ""a person of interest"", their existing surveillance file (they have one on everyone) will be looked up to see what the NSA has on them.

The scope of the NSA's data collection :-
ALL phone records, including Meta data giving location.
The contents of ALL phone calls
ALL Emails
ALL texts
ALL voicemails
ALL SKYPE conversations
Large amounts of social media activity
ALL internet searches
ALL internet sites visited
Large amounts of electronic financial transactions - bank accounts and purchases etc.

Some of the political enemies, dissidents or rivals that are to be targeted as ""persons of interest""

Occupy protesters
Leading climate change protesters
Keystone pipeline protesters

Anti Monsanto organizers
Tea Party activists
Gun rights activists
Troublesome journalists (there are not many of those these days, the vast majority of mainstream journalists are lapdogs for the Establishment)
National politicians - members of Congress
Federal judges
State politicians
Leaders of State Parties
Critics of the NSA
Vocal critics of government policies
Top military personnel
Top government officials
Business people

Lawyers
Civil rights activists

etc. etc.

There are now something like 800,000 people on government watch lists.
Probably at least half of them have nothing whatsoever to do with Islamic Extremism or Terrorism.
They are people the government DOESN'T LIKE and wants to CONTROL.

Basically, I owe a crapload of taxes to the fed and some to NYS. Never had to owe taxes, but obviously rolling my 401(k) over meant I'd be paying. I guess I was shortsighted back then (also focused on the move/new job/new state/etc.).

I don't have $8000 cash to pay it off. I'm still settling in out here so saving money after the move has been slow going.

Question is: do I set up an installment plan with the IRS to pay it off over some time? I was thinking of biting the bullet and just taking it out of the IRA (paying the penalty, taxes, etc.) to pay it off and start the saving process over again. It wouldn't wipe it all out, but it'd be a good chunk of money. That might just perpetuate this ""owing taxes"" cycle.

Should I take out a personal loan from my bank? Trying to pay this off with the least amount of headache possible.

Thanks for listening reddit.",finance,1391281088

politics,The insanity of government policies (both parties) and the Corporate controlled media's silence upon it,"Read more at : http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-conspiracy-of-silence-in-media.html

There are a whole range of subjects and issues where the Corporate controlled media is completely silent and never mentions the real problems affecting America and how they can easily be fixed.

The media no longer performs their primary function which is to question the government and inform the public.
Corporate media's only goal is to not rock the boat and maximize profits.

If any presenter or pundit were to start discussing any of the following issues in any objective fashion they would be fired, any guests would not be invited back and if any of the subjects are raised on air there is always ""a technical fault"" or ""sorry, we seem to have run out of time"" excuse to cut any discussion off quickly.  

The numerous issues the media is silent upon :-

The $1.3tn of annual Corporate Welfare a year
The $1.2tn of annual subsidies and continuing bailouts to the big banks

The endemic corruption within the political system where large corporations buy the politicians with campaign donations and write their own laws and regulations.
If the media reported the campaign contributions by politician and relevant industry whenever a vote was held in  Congress it would soon become apparent to everyone how deeply corrupt the current system is.
E.G. Those on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who voted yes for intervention in Syria received double the amount of campaign contributions on average from the 'defense' industry, compared to those who voted no.

That the Federal Reserve is a completely privately owned institution whose aims, like any other private company, are to maximize the profits of it's major shareholders - the large banks.
The Federal Reserve private bank is always presented as a force for good in the media, when the exact opposite is undoubtedly true. The Federal Reserve is good for the big banks and bad for the rest of America. 

The continuing removal of civil rights as defined in the Bill of Rights - not much is now left.

The fact that Obama is a Corporatist with policies for the top 0.1% and large crony corporations, not a Democrat with policies for the 99%.

The fact that the Rule of Law no longer applies in America.
The extremely wealthy and the boards of large Corporations can get away with pretty much any white collar crime. The only penalties handed out are occasional trivial fines.
While the poor are subject to extremely harsh jail sentences for trivial crimes (and often no crime at all - just abusing their own bodies). 

The real reasons why the American government wants to intervene in Syria.
It has nothing whatsoever to do with chemical weapons.
It has everything to do with big bucks, gas pipelines, increasing military spending and the interests of Saudi Arabia and Israel.
It is not in America's interests to support Islamic Extremists in Syria that make up the bulk of the ""rebels"".

The increasingly monopoly powers of the Federal government and the complete monopoly powers of the Federal Reserve private bank over monetary policy.
The genius of the United States was that it was a system of friendly competition between ""the several states"" who each had their own laws, control of their monetary and financial systems and their own currencies.
This has now all but disappeared and replaced by the Federal government collecting the vast majority of the tax take and thus power, rather than the individual states having that power as defined in the Constitution.  

The monopolistic cartels that now operate in each major industry, with the extremely unhealthy undue influence over the government and lack of competition that comes with it.
The top 5 big banks
The top 5 big oil companies
The top 6 media conglomerates that now control 90% of America's media
The top 10 arms companies for hardware
The top 5 arms companies software
The 5 or so top pharmaceutical companies that dictate the price of drugs in America, favoritism for which is provided by the government in general and by the FDA
Monsanto, Dow Chemical and Bayer which now effectively control food production in the U.S.

The companies in these cartels spend far more on lobbying the Federal government than they ever pay in taxes in order to maintain their monopolistic position and favorable treatment by the government.
To say nothing of the millions they spend in campaign contributions every year.

The real reasons the the government is now spying on every American and collecting just about every  electronic communication.
It's not to protect the American public - quite the reverse, it's to protect the government from the people by identifying and then suppressing domestic dissenters. The same reason the Stasi set up their Mass Surveillance program in East Germany.

Israel and the power of AIPAC lobbying.
AIPAC lobbies for Israel's interests, not America's.
The great majority of the time, what AIPAC lobbies for is directly AGAINST America's interests.
America's unquestioning support of Israel creates many more enemies of America - it has been a primary recruiting tool for the Islamic Extremists for decades.
The unwavering support for Israel undermining America's interests was raised by General Petraeus in testimony to Congress in 2010, he immediately became a target for removal from public life.  
The suppression of any objective discussion of Israel runs deep in America - you are not even allowed to mention the subject on Democratic Underground, almost all other subjects are allowed. 

Nobody is even allowed to criticize Saudi Arabia in the media for fear of upsetting what is an autocratic state, that keeps it's own people poor in favor of enriching it's Royal Family while exporting it's own form of Extremist Islam - Wahhabism that has laws and the treatment of women that best belong back in the Middle Ages.

The fact that the drone warfare program actually recruits more Islamic Extremists and Jihadists than it kills and is deliberately designed to do so.
Drone strikes kill ten times as many innocent civilians as piloted airstrikes.
Where would the military industrial complex be if it didn't create more enemies?

America is now spending $1.2tn a year on arms or 8% of GDP, without a single credible military threat.
For comparison China is spending around $100bn a year or 2% of GDP, despite having a million strong army which is largely used for domestic control.
As the Founders were well aware of :-
Trade and friendly relations makes nations wealthy, war and excessive military spending makes nations poor.
A truism that China is applying and America has completely forgotten.  

The primary objective of an arms company CEO is not to make America safe.
His primary purpose is to sell more arms to maximize profits. This objective is helped if there are more wars and conflicts in the world and Americans feel and actually are LESS safe.

The relentless decline in America's overall wealth, strategic power, economic power and financial stability (since 2000).
The relentless decline in America's relative strength since 2000 and the rise in Asia's.
The unsustainability of the National Debt - it is never going to be paid off. 
The transition from American hegemony to Asia centered on China is already apparent.
The Chinese and Russians are working on plans to replace the US dollar as the Global Reserve Currency - they are building an economic coalition with India, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, Australia, Chile, the rest of South America and half of Africa.

The relentless decline in ordinary people's standard of living. 

The understatement of true inflation in official government statistics.
Real inflation is between 6 and 9% not the circa 2% reported.
How much have your food, gas, healthcare and college education costs gone up in the last 10 years?
All of these things have gone up by around  8 to 10% a year over the last 10 years.
All of these things have a far more significant effect on the 99% than they do on the top 1%. 

The understatement of true unemployment rates.
U6 unemployment which includes those who can no longer claim benefits is 14%..
Real unemployment is now 24% - this includes discouraged workers who have given up looking for a job, because there are no decent paying jobs out there.

The fact that social mobility in America is now in the bottom three in the developed world.
50 years ago there was a thriving, widespread and growing middle class in America.
Just about everybody in America could aspire to it and most did if they worked for it.
The middle classes are now being wiped out by government policies.

The fact that education standards in America have dramatically declined and have fallen behind other developed countries.
The fact that spending more money won't fix the problem.
The STYLE of education needs to change back towards where it was 50 years ago.

The fact that sending 50% of young people to college isn't helping when only 10 to 20% of jobs actually require a college degree.
The old system of on the job training, apprenticeships and community colleges for work related skills was far better than the system we have now.
It didn't load young people up with $30,000 of debt as they started out in life.
It didn't increase the cost of college education by 8 or 10% a year.

The fact that American Healthcare now costs twice as much as any other developed country, with worse overall outcomes. The average lifespan of Americans is now declining from already low levels.
The fact that Obamacare is going to make things even worse by making American Healthcare even less efficient..

The American Healthcare system makes more people sick for longer. This makes more money for large drugs companies, large insurers and large Healthcare companies.

The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), currently being negotiated, which subordinates national sovereignty and national laws in order to favor multinationals and large corporations. 
It will have far more severe detrimental effects, as it stands, on America and American jobs than Nafta.

The Federal government and Federal taxes are far too high which makes America in general far less competitive with the rest of the world.
America grew from almost nothing, to the greatest economic power in the world in around 130 years without a Federal income tax at all, it would prosper again if the Federal government was reduced to the confines as defined in the Bill of Rights. 

The real reasons why the government does not want to legalize drugs.

How to turn things around from America's current death spiral of lower wealth and higher poverty and create a virtuous circle of increasing prosperity like the 1950's and 1960's.

politics,"Fun collection of battles in the ""War on Women"".","Congressional republicans passed a bill [HR358](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.358:) that explicitly states that it is okay for hospitals or doctors to leave women to die during ectopic pregnancy or complicated miscarriage.


If hospitals/doctors refuse to train or perform abortions under any circumstances, even if the embryo is going to die no matter what, they face no penalty or liability. 

In fact, hospitals face more liability if they help her so there is a financial incentive to let the woman die. 

Did you know that dozens of bills presented at state level would ban doctors and hospitals from saving a woman's life, even if the embryo or fetus will die no matter what? 

I like this [Nevada bill](http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/prolife_decision.pdf) because Judge James E. Wilson summarizes it so well: 

&gt;The initiative would protect a prenatal person regardless of whether or not the prenatal person would live, grow, or develop in the womb or survive birth; prevent all abortions even in the case of rape, incest, or serious threats to the woman's health or life, or when a woman is suffering from a miscarriage, or as an emergency treatment for an ectopic pregnancy. The initiative will impact some rights Nevada women currently have to access certain fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. The initiative will impact some rights Nevada women currently have to utilize some forms of birth control, including the ""pill;"" and to access certain fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. The initiative will affect embryonic stem cell research, which offers potential for treating diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, and others. 

[Texas passed and implemented abortion laws that 100% fit the legal definition of rape-by-coercion](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/opinion/sunday/kristof-when-states-abuse-women.html).  In the state of Texas, if a woman wants an abortion, a LEGAL medical procedure, she must submit to being violated vaginally for strictly moral/religious reasons. 

A woman is forced to undergo, and pay for, a transvaginal ultrasound. There is no medical reason for this procedure and it ties up diagnostic equipment and technicians. It is only to force her to undergo a description and viewing of her embryo. 

In Georgia, they tried to pass a bill that would ban women from ""aborting"" dead fetuses, even if it means the woman gets sepsis and rots to death. [Rep. Terry England said this was no problem, because it happens to pigs and cows on his farm. So why not the ladies?!?! He went on to tell a touching story about cock-fighting](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEfVLPWPvw). This genius is writing Georgia law. 

Right-wingers are disgusted that they need to cover women's birth control under insurance plans. Birth control is a pharmaceutical. I pay into a pharmaceutical plan as part of my salary. Republicans are demanding that women pay twice for perscription drugs while covering 100% of men's perscription drugs, including Viagra for *gasp* single men!!!! 

Pregnancy is dangerous even in young, healthy, fit women. [Blood volume](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/4075604/) increases from 100% to between 140% and 150%. This strains every organ and system in the body. 

Defects in organs or arteries that would never be an issue at 100% volume, become an issue. 

[Birth control prevents literally hundreds of pregnancy-related complications. These include, but are not limited to, stroke, organ failure, blindness, retardation (of mother or infant), chronic high blood pressure, diabetes and death.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_pregnancy)

Should we stop covering blood pressure medication and only cover the the heart-attack? Or are only women not allowed to prevent our horrible deaths or permanent handicaps? 

Republicans want to ban all abortion (banning most types of popular birth control including the [birth control pill](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9eMf1ermDZ8&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9eMf1ermDZ8) ). 

The federal Republican Party leaves [no exception for rape or incest](http://mobile.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-20/republican-platform-won-t-protect-mortgage-tax-deduction).  They will graciously allow us to save our own lives. 

Then republicans want to remove all socialized medicine to help this precious ""gift from God"" or the mother (who cares, right?) live through and unattended labor or, if you're nice, allow her to start her new baby's life under a mountain of debt? 

Republicans want to cut school lunches, schools, welfare, food stamps, subsidized daycare and student loans. A woman can't bring her child to work, leave it unattended, afford daycare, get welfare, afford food, shelter, medicine for this life that matters so much. 

Then Texas executes the [innocent](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/15/carlos-texas-innocent-man-death) and [mentally retarded](http://www.thenation.com/blog/169243/updated-texas-executes-man-iq-61).

personalfinance,Personal advice for 24 M with little financial experience? (US - CA),"Hello everybody.  I've been mostly lurking for quite some time in this sub and /r/investing, but I thought I'd make a post to hopefully get some  advice and/or perspective.

So basically I'm a 24 year old guy, started my first job job over a year ago, making about $2400 a month after taxes.  My shitty car died right as I got hired and I was sick of having to pay for repairs (long commute as well), so I ended up buying a new car with a high interest rate.  Ready to cringe?  I owe about 19k, at about 17% interest.  My credit is poor, and refinancing does not look like an option right now.

I have little expenses other than car and insurance.  I don't pay rent and food is probably the biggest portion of my budget.  I'm trying to work on cutting costs on eating out, but I work and go to school full time so I don't have much time to cook on my own, etc.  Basically right now I'm just trying to build my credit back up and pay down that debt quickly.  I really only have one credit card, and I try to use about a third of the credit limit, paying it off every month.  I recently signed up for a Mint account to get a view of the bigger picture and it's helping.

I've also been thinking about setting up a Roth IRA / retirement type setup.  I've been reading that it's important to get started young, but obviously paying down debt at high interest is a priority.  Right now I have a sharebuilder account with a couple  shares in both VB and VOO but to be honest I still haven't covered my trade fees.  But I figured I wouldn't really start paying attention until I have some skin in the game.  I'm not really trying to invest a ton of money right now, but it'd be nice to establish good habits.  Is there a type of account that would let me buy ~$100 in ETFs a month without getting killed by trade fees?  I recently opened up a Charles Schwab account too, but haven't done anything with it yet.

Any advice / tips are appreciated.",finance,1391288458

For those that are U.S. citizens and residents, please [contact your congressional representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) requesting them to support Net Neutrality.  This is especially important for small business owners who have Republican representatives.  Please explain how Net Neutrality will hurt small businesses.

All small business owners should write to [The National Federation of Independent Business](http://www.nfib.com/about-nfib/) asking them to lobby congress to support Net Neutrality.

U.S. residents can also write opinion letters and articles for their local newspapers.  (This has been reported by many to be the most effective way to get your congressperson's attention.)

Foreign nationals should contact representatives in their governments to apply political pressure on the U.S. explaining how a biased internet could affect innovation and international trade.  You can also write opinion articles to large U.S. papers explaining the effect on innovation and international trade.  (Some good papers would are The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post.)

In all correspondence, please mention the petitions and how many people have signed them.

Also, if you have not done so, you can sign the online petitions.  They don't take a large time commitment to sign and every signature will help bolster the arguments made through all other channels.

Petitions:

I am opening a few marijuana retail stores in Washington state, where it (along with Colorado) has been legalized for recreational use.

Currently, federal law dictates that banks cannot accept money made from the sale of drugs (which, for illegal drugs makes send and I support). 

Although that law is changing soon to support legalized drugs, I would love to accept payment in Dogecoin. I'm positive there are at least a handful of r/trees subscribers that are loyal Shibes.

  I'm looking for a little advice. I am currently a junior in college. I have about 30k in student loans with about 10k coming next year. The interest rate is pegged pretty low and they are all either subsidized or I have been paying the interest on them while in school. My question is this:

I left my last job with about 10k in my 401k which I rolled over into an IRA. I know I can use this money for school without the 10% penalty, (I know I still pay income tax on it). But is that the wisest use of the money? 
I am 25, and by the time I finish school I will be 27. I am getting married in 3 weeks and based on my sisters' weddings, we should have another 4k in gifts from that. My future wife is really focused on getting a house, she is from the midwest and takes home ownership really seriously. I am also sick of paying rent, when I know that I could be putting equity into a house. Would I be better off letting the wedding money and the IRA grow for 2-3 years in moderate risk-moderate reward funds, and then use it as a sizeable down payment on a house? Or am I better off using it avoid the last student loan? I understand that with the intricacies of the personal situation its a more difficult question than it appears. Thanks!

TL;DR: Student has 10k in IRA, should he spend it on tuition, reducing student loans or save it for a house down payment?",finance,1391311763

I would like to get a rewards card to make my purchases with (and pay back at the end of the month) and get some points that I can redeem for travel (and possibly other benefits like travel insurance, extended warranties, etc.).

I would much rather have a single solid credit card to use. I have excellent credit (~ 750 FICO) and am not too concerned with interest rates as I don't plan on ever rolling my balance.

I'll be graduating this year from grad school and I'm expecting to be employed full time within a year.

What I'm dealing with:  
* $25,000 in savings with a terrible interest rate.  
* $17,200 in EE savings bonds at 4%, final maturity 2018.  
* $30,600 in student loans at 6.8%, $8,500 subsidized (for now, heh).  

I also have $17,000 in my IRA, but that doesn't factor into my calculation.  I currently live at home and will continue to until I find full time employment.  My only big upcoming expenditure will be a 2 week railroading trip across Europe that I'm planning as my graduation present to myself.  My parents have pledged to help out, but I'm provisionally budgeting $5000 for that (I always overbudget for travel, this is not an ""I intend to spend X dollars"" amount and I'm looking at hostels and traveling off-season in April).

Psychologically I really want to be rid of that student debt, so my plan is to take the $20,000 remaining and put $17k of that towards loans, keeping $3,000 to restart my emergency fund.  The ~$14k balance I'd pay off by cashing in the bonds.

Moderators - If you have to move it fine, but read first I think it can stay in this forum as it should help some understand how inflation/deflation fundamentally affects our DOGE&gt;

see my reply - 

I have to say I am impressed, your write-up is spot on.  Placing a cap on supply of any currency is in fact a complete necessity that will absolutely support the value and discourage unwanted/unintentional inflationary elements which could and would have had a seriously negative impact on price stability of Doge coin. For those of us that are not familiar with how inflation/deflation effects the value of currency I will give you a prime example in which we are currently dealing with and have been for the past 6 years following the housing bubble/mortgage market crash in 2007. After the market tanked our economy was so slow  the Federal Reserve (U.S.A.'s central bank), dramatically dropped the over night fed funding rate to 0.25%. It has been at this number for the last 6 years as I said prior. The Fed Reserve is in place primarily to keep inflation/deflation at a set target rate (typically 2.25%) using a number of monetary tools in which they have at their disposal. After pretty much exhausting all of the tools available to the Fed, which includes lowering.raising the fed funds rate, Lowering the discount rate in which banks can borrow funds from the fed reserve (Those are the two primary ""weapons"" one would say, in order to boost or slow down our economy. The recession was so bad that they introduced a few new programs in which are still in play today, 6 years after the fact which I personally believe that they have no idea what the actual impact will be after all is said and done. This new program/s has to do with monetary policy purchasing of mortgage backed securities and or capitalization of the larger investment banks such as Citi, Wells Fargo, Chase, BOA...Etc. You name the lender, they all participated in this program even if they did not necessarily need it to stay afloat. Mortgage backed securities are pretty much pools of hundreds of thousands of mortgages in which us U.S. Citizens take out to buy our homes. Rating Agency's such as BlackRock, Moody's, Standard and Poors...etc, rate these instruments as either A,AA, AAA as far as risk associated with a particular pool of these mortgages. With out getting to technical I will get to the point. All of these programs, buying of mortgages, buying our own debt from Treasuries costs BILLIONS and BILLIONS of dollars each month. I believe the FED just started to cut back on the amount of Debt or treasuries we are adding to our balance sheet each month by 10 Billion dollars month. Ok, Now that I got this far here is my point, this money has to come from some where, it does not just appear from thin air. No, The U.S. is printing new dollars at a pace in which we have never experienced in the history of all economies world wide.What does this mean? Being we have never experienced something like this before, there so many different opinions from some very well educated and experienced financial guru's, CEO's of large investment bankers, and or Harvard Business School equivalent educated economists. I personally have heard the following and agree for the most part that this can and will effect our economy sooner than later. The assumption is that the excessive printing of currency approaching trillions of dollars being brought to the supply for the US, this will eventually is going lead to  a Major cycle of HYPER INFLATION. Basically, it comes down to supply and demand. Economics 101 - Macro-economics, to much supply, demand does not meet the supply curve, devaluing the dollar to a point in which it will cost hundreds of  dollar's to purchase the same loaf of bread you pay around $3.99 for today. The federal reserve has no cap on what they can add to thet market,, if they did have a cap our US dollar, our economy in the short term probably would have failed and things would have gotten alot worse than what it did. 

Ok, So if you are following me still, I give you credit, economics I understand is not the most interesting  subject to study lol.

Any way, with the cap in place on DOGE coin we now have place a prevent or, fail safe from any form of hyper inflation which would in turn destroy rather quickly, the value of Doge over night as in, if Doge ever reached  $10.00a (that would be fantastic) the night before, you could wake up to having a million doge coins that are worth no more than .01 and probably wanting to jump of of a rather tale skyscraper in NYC such as lets sayyyyy, the empire sate building - that would probably be the best choice as far as height (I kid I kid!!!!). 

To sum it up, to many doge coins on the market floods the supply, while demand may stay constant unfortunately, value falls intensely!!!!!!extremely fast and no bounce back.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

Good job on the theoretical i cap, I think this will give this currency some more recognition as a fundamentally sound form of Crypto currency, holdisg Doge's own head and shoulders either with or ABOVE BIT COIN/LITECOIN. Take away the joking nature and to me, if I had to chose a crypto to invest in, it woule be DOGE COIN due to the nature of the currency, the known rules in code which for whatever reason, is working.

I really don't want to have to mail off my taxes if possible and TurboTax hasn't been able to give me an answer. From what I gather, you can update the changes but have to wait for the IRS to reject your form (which I presume they will do since it didn't reflect all my employment) and then resubmit-hopefully online again without having to pay an additional fee.

My scholarship wants our FAFSA to be submitted by the end of February, so that means that we have to file our taxes for the IRS.

Usually we ask my uncle to help us out with this, but my cousin recently had surgery so we really don't want to bother him.

Both my parents and I are not very familiar with the process, but we are willing to learn, and I think it is a good thing, so that we both get familiar with the process and be more self-sufficient!

I have some questions:
What services would you recommend, that are user-friendly and free/cheap, to do our taxes?

I have done a search already, but I am overwhelmed by the number of resources. I have a tendency to compile all these resources but not sure what to do with them.

In this case, I have heard of TurboTax, TaxAct, TaxSlayer, free e-filing on IRS, ""doing it by paper first,"" etc.

I'm not sure what is relevant to include but my parents file joint; we have a house mortgage; no stock investments; my parents file me as a dependent (19/m); from last year's tax forms we have ""itemized deductions"" 

I'm just a bit hesistant on filling out any of the e-filing since this is all a learning process and I don't want the e-filing to automatically send and then we've made a mistake. It also confuses me that there is both federal and state tax forms.

Also, this is the first time where I, too, have received a W-2 in the mail. 
If I am claimed as a dependent in my parents' tax forms, do I need to file federal/state taxes as well? 
I read on here that I must check a box that says ""someone else can claim me as dependent""
I have done a search and it says that if income is below 6100 (which is true) then
I have checked the ""box 2"" and it does have ""income witheld"".

On my side of things, I do not have any student loans. I did have a job for the year that the taxes are filed for. I have a checkings, savings, and a credit card.  

Please help me find a foothold on where to begin. We have the tax forms from previous years that my uncle did for us to help aid in understanding this process. I feel like once we start ""doing"" and figuring out where to start, this whole process will be less daunting

I also read on this subreddit some great advice of ""doing it both on TurboTax and TaxAct to see if the numbers were the same;"" I'd like to do something like that so we have some sort of check as we learn through this.

Please and thank you for all advice. I have done some research on the advanced search but it is all very overwhelming. That being said, I am very willing to learn, so that I may help my family in the future and save us from paying money at places like H&amp;R Block.

investing,The Best Investment You Can Make Today. It Will Shock You To Your Core. Guaranteed.,"That’s right….. the United States Dollar. 

Yeah, yeah, I know what your are thinking. Dollar is piece of shit and this Alex dude has lost all of his marbles. The FED is printing $65 Billion a month, interest rates are technically negative and hyperinflation is just around the corner.

Americans will soon need to use barrels of cash just to buy anything at the local supermarket. If you are to listen to Gold Bugs or PermaBears you would soon believe that the US will soon turn into Zimbabwe and that only gold and shotguns will save you.

zimbabwe-money

Clearly, there is no love for the dollar, but hear me out. There is a couple of reasons to love the USD. 

Reason #1: Everyone hates it. What do I constantly try to teach you here? To generate huge profits you must buy what other people hate. So, instead of buying Google at over $1,000 you buy Stinky Fertilizer, Inc (STINK). Assuming the company is fairly priced and has good fundamentals.

Reason #2: The USD has nothing to do with all the credit being generated at the present moment. There is a distinction between a balance sheet transaction between the FED/banks and the actual “physical” dollars. There is only a few of the real dollars to go around compared to the credit outstanding. That is why when the credit collapses the USD typically surges higher.

That is exactly what happened during the 2007-2009 credit crisis. The dollar index shot up from 71.30 in 2008 to 89.20 in 2009. When credit collapses, people scramble for dollars as there isn’t enough to go around. Typically, driving the value of the USD higher.

Reason #3: From the long-term technical perspective the USD is setup for a large move here. The long-term chart (from 2005…not provided here) shows that the currency is about to break out. Either up or down. Since everyone hates the currency and since my mathematical work predicts the credit crunch as well as the significant stock market decline, I would anticipate the dollar to break out to the upside.

CONCLUSION:

The best investment you can make right now is to accumulate dollars. Worst case scenario is that the dollar stays around the same levels while the stock market declines. Giving you the ability to buy great companies at significant discount. 

The best case scenario? Dollar zooms up while the market goes down to the tune of 40%. Giving you a higher purchasing power, no risk and massive returns down the road. Of course, this scenario would work wonders for foreign investors in particular.",finance,1391457526

personalfinance,What should you do with your portfolio distribution when the stock market starts to sink?

I'm just curious what the smartest move is, when the market makes a downturn.  I'm not panicking regarding today's 326 pt drop, but looking back to 2007 and wondering if I made the right move.

I understand that you should keep buying stocks, especially when they are low.  My question is, what do with the shares you already have?  Is it smart to move them to securities in order to retain their value?  Or is it best to just leave it as it is?  

After the 2007 downturn, I literally did not touch my TSP portfolio (70% C fund, 15% S fund, 15% I fund), but am wondering if I'd moved the shares already purchased to securities, while still buying C fund shares low, if my account total would be higher.

personalfinance,What Would You Do In My Situation?,"Hi r/personalfinance!

Sorry in advance for the wall of text! Anyone who gets some time to read/respond would be greatly appreciated. Long time lurker here, but I’ve been seeking as much advice as possible so I figured why not test the waters for some of your guys’ thoughts. 

I’m currently a college senior, and will be graduating in early May. I was lucky enough to secure an offer recently for an entry-level position with a Fortune 500 company to start in June. Here are some details:

•	Will be in Chicago, IL

•	$68,000 annual salary

•	Comprehensive benefits (including medical, dental, long-term disability, pension, and 401(k)

•	Company will match 100% up to 3% of my 401(k) contributions

•	This is a three year contract with the expectation that I’ll be continuing on with the company once the current offer expires 

•	Living alone 

•	Living arrangement expenses are also provided – including a furnished apartment with washer, dryer, linens, kitchen items and utilities

I really don’t know how to prepare for such a drastic change in income, and I want to make sure I adjust appropriately without things like entertainment expenses skyrocketing. Given that over the last three summers I’ve worked full time making about $500/week with rent being my main expense (between $600 and $800 per month), I feel I can be more than comfortable keeping my expenses below say $1200/month. I’ll have a cell phone plan at about $100/mo, will most likely buy a car between $15k-$20k (not a clue as to what’s standard on monthly payments for a car of this price), and of course auto insurance. I can’t imagine groceries will cost me more than $100/week, and entertainment I’d like to keep between $100-$200 per week. I also will have about $30,000 in debt from school that I’d like to start chipping away at. Not sure what the interest rates will be on that. 

On top of all this, the job opportunity itself has an outstanding upside. The company has shown keen interest in me and has expressed their desire to have me grow in a career within the company, as long as it remains mutually beneficial. There’s really no reason my salary should ever hit a glass ceiling if I perform to the potential that I believe I have. As such, a part of me really wants to take this time to be somewhat risky with my investments. Not stupid risky, but risky given the fact that I’ll most likely never have so much opportunity to be risky in the future (assuming wife/kids come into play).

I realize how fortunate I am right now with this offer, but my expenses will only go up from here, and I want to be as prepared as possible when this happens. I’d like somewhat of a big family, so having kids’ tuition ready in thirty years would be ideal. What are your guys’ thoughts on 401(k) contributions? I am thinking about going until they match me, and investing another 20% or so personally in higher risk scenarios. I’m very interested in personal investing/trading and have been pretty successful with it in the past (albeit with a part time salary), so I certainly want to take advantage of that. Basically, what would you guys do if you were in my current situation?

Thank you guys for all of your help. This is a great community and I’ve learned a hell of a lot more about personal finance in the last year or so than I ever would have otherwise. I’m really just looking for any guidance to get me in a sort of optimum risk/reward scenario given all these details, so everyone’s input and constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.",finance,1391475720
dogecoin,Dogecoin has now become an experiment in economics. No other successful coin has done what we did..,"So I was trying to mull over the charts and the long winded economics lessons from the various sources. We have the howler monkeys claiming it was the end of the coin  and we had the screech owls with charts saying it was all for the best. 

Let me preface that I am an electronics and mechanical engineer and I build things . some artful and some ... well some that might land me on a no fly list someday....or gitmo .. or in a government lab. 

Point being that I was never an economics major nor did I dabble in the voodoo and tea leaf readings I personally believe they do. It seems the rules of the universe they play in changes day by day , with gravity suddenly reversing itself, and air spontaniously turning into gold.

Whenever I watch CNBC I want to leap upon a desk , take off my clothes down to a loincloth and scream ""IT""S A MADDD HOOUUSSSE A MAAAADD HOOOUSSE!"" 

But I digress. (let me put my clothes back on) 

The recent happenstance and decisions by the one person who holds all the strings where it concerns Doge coin and its future value, had me a bit perplexed at first. Charts flew by my head at a dizzying pace only to come to a single inescapable fact.

No cryptocurrency has ever done this before, It had been uncapped in the number of coins (over the years) that it would allow itself to produce.The idea being  to grow as a viable currency. Now this was troubling for more than a few to say the least. 

The experiment that is the Dogecoin was based on the premise that perhaps it would be as .. oh 10% as successful as BTC, And they would be able to buy a house, a education for their kids , Christmas would be a blast since little billy would be able to get his GIJOE with the Kung Foo grip .. you know the drill, neckbeards moving out of their parents basement. yadd yadda yadda,     

But now the experiment of the ""tipping coin of the internet"" changed the game . Uncapped.. 

IF people were into Doge to make money like people did with BTC, We are in uncharted lands. But was it really so unexpected? the founder himself has said quite point blank that it was not what he wanted for the coin. Any investor who was squirreling away their Doges should have known something like this was going to come about

""Answer hazy , check back in a year""   

Sigh. 

I hope I am wrong but since we are now all in a giant experiment. ( we were in one before but we had a level of control over the success or failure ) 

The foundation of how other coins that had some (monetary) success with the hard (semihard) cap is now gone,  BTC became a juggernaut so powerful that major retailers are now accepting them
(SIC) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10562976/Major-US-retailer-starts-accepting-Bitcoin-payments.html

That is a major part of how this becomes a REAL currency places to spend it. But I get the feeling that meme behind it does not want that. that there is something sinister and wrong about wanting the currency to succeed to the levels of BTC. That it shouldl have a fiat value of less than 1.00 forever. 

Now don't get me wrong here, I get the idea, sharing and hope and caring for others, I think it is a wonder and beautiful meme. But will that in the end translate into me being able to pay rent with them one day?
  
What we believe Doge should be about may not be what retailers and major companies agree that is important. In short we could see it being THE tipping currency of the internet , but that's it. Unless we can convince major retailers to become partners like BTC has done,  expanding outwards to reach those who don't read Reddit may be a hard sell if there is no ""investment"" opportunities 

Lastly I think one of the reasons behind a lot of the push back on the experiment was that a single man changed the rules, or can change the rules whenever he wants.  This grand trip we are all on with Doge. I guess we expected to be a little bit different than the Fed making the same choices for us.   

That's my take on it YMMV",cryptocurrency,1391478905

personalfinance,I need help figuring out my parents' retirement strategy while enduring crushing ($200k) student debt...,"Long post incoming. I'll try to keep it to the bare facts, but this post was a long time coming. If this post is inappropriate for PF, I'll delete it.

**The Financial Situation**

My parents (60M and 52F) are uneducated immigrant parents with little English speaking ability. They've owned and operated a dry cleaners for the last two and a half decades and that was their only source of income.  They also own a 2BR/2BA one-story home (paid off the last of the mortgage last year) here in the SF bay area. As stubborn immigrant parents, they are hesitant to share their financials/budget with me or any of their other sons (ages 26, 25, 16). But from what I've gleaned they've taken over $100k in equity steadily out of their home (bought for about ~$200k in late 90s, now probably worth $500k or $600k? It's fully repaid though) to finance their failing dry cleaning business over the years. They have a car (05 Toyota Corolla) debt they're trying to pay off but I'm not sure how much is left on it. They pay all of their credit card debt on time and in full. They want out of having to work in a dry cleaners for the rest of their lives but they have no idea how to begin. They feel stuck in a bad situation and I want to help them out.

I am 26 and have approximately $120k stored in bitcoins (let's keep pro/con arguments out of this. This is purely a matter of addressing our finances). My one year anniversary is coming up so I am assuming I'll be subject to the long term capital gains tax when I do cash them out. I'm also approximately $200k in student loan debt (law school, all government loans with interest rates ranging 5.4% to 7.9%). I'll be graduating this spring and will have a job paying $40k - $50k gross per year (let's not criticize my decision to go to law school. I'm just trying to present the financial situation here). I also have a portfolio in traditional stocks worth $12k, up from $10k. I generally am able to live on $25k a year in expenses (rent, food, fun, etc.). I do not own a home (rent) and I do not have a car. 

My 25 year old brother is making I think $60k gross, no debt. Has a car ('11 Honda CRV) he's paying off, I believe. Not sure how much he has left but probably still a lot.

**My (Shitty) Plan**

My main priority is to help my parents retire. My plan is to cash out my bitcoins and my stock portfolio and reinvest elsewhere into something that would produce a very passive income. My parents could possibly use the proceeds of selling their business (after paying off the equity they've taken out of their home) to join into a collective portfolio with me to produce this passive income. My first instinct was to look at equity REITs to provide a safe(r) passive income. I understand that there's some risk with the Fed messing with interest rates, so I'm unsure of this strategy.  Hopefully, with a 10% ROI on a $200k+ initial investment, it should carry them some part of the way until they pass in about 20 - 30 years. For any remaining expenses, I and my brother will cover them via our salaries. 

I'm trying to avoid any business-based ways of income because I fear my aging parents won't be able to handle it, given their limited English, formal education, and experience outside of the dry clean industry. My parents were exploring buying a second home with the equity in their first home, but based on what I've read here it doesn't seem like a good strategy for them.

**Conclusion**

I've been lurking PF long enough that the common advice is to pay off my soul-crushing loan debt first. But as you can see, with the intervening factors and the priority being providing for my parents, I cannot and will not pursue this strategy unless it is for a good reason. I plan on paying off the minimum payment possible in the meantime until my parents pass and I have access to my funds again. Edit: I will listen to sounds ways of helping my parents without getting my own finances involved, if possible, just to be clear.

Please share any and all advice you have. This is purely a financial arrangement I would like to address, **so please leave emotion/politics/unconstructive criticism at the door**. I know this is asking a lot to restructure the financial aspect of our family's life, but any bump in the right direction will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",finance,1391486047

dogecoin,Bitcoin wtf,"First of all, I've been with Bitcoin since nearly the beginning. The Bitcoin community used to be much lot like Doge back in the very early days, except the general feeling back then was much more ""grass roots"", and we had way, WAY more opposition than any new crypto today.

Doge and other alts have the benefit of Bitcoin forging ahead and fighting their battles for them. Be those battles in congress, the states, or with federal agencies and governments world wide.

And even now, things are far from certain even with bitcoin. The point is, the fact that you can have a light-hearted Doge community is a direct result of Bitcoiners legitimizing crypto, and the fact that no one in your sub has to go to a meeting with senators. The people that made bitcoin great are still here. Bitcoin is a great community. Ive seen plenty of posts of bitcoiners pouring their hearts out in gratitude for what bitcoin has done for them.

However, Bitcoin will not make everyone rich. Neither will LTC. Nor will DOGE coin.

Think about it.

In time, Doge will mature to a point where it will seem more beneficial to new users to adopt some other, plucky coin. The same way people branched off from BTC to make LTC, and then peercoin, and quark coin... Doge coin, what have you...

There are diminishing returns to all these alts. There are diminishing returns because its just not possible for everyone to be rich. We don't have star trek technology yet to remove want. To remove the need for a currency all together. But I think what Bitcoin is doing, what 3d printing is doing, to where energy producing technology is going is truly a step in that direction. Where we're going, we wont even need a currency in terms of how we think about them today.

I don't expect anyone to JUMP into bitcoin. Bitcoin is going to grow to a point where people are going to be using it without even knowing it. Just like the internet works today. Its a network, a protocol, not just a currency.

If Bitcoiners seem short with you, its because we are still fighting hard to make this a reality. To make this legitimate. To free us from the current world-wide government sanctioned criminal organization that is modern finance.

When we see post after post of ""OMG Doge up 100x!!"" this is something we have seen before. These gains do not last. Not for Bitcoin or any coin. Bitcoiners, and people getting into bitcoin now are not doing so in hopes of huge profits, but because Bitcoin as a protocol is useful and beneficial in comparison to traditional banking.

This is not a fight easily won. We need to stick together. The Bitcoin protocol is open source. We can change it as one giant community to make it more perfect. We need to focus on the big picture.",cryptocurrency,1391488674

dogecoin,Dear Fellow Shibes! Inflation and Money Supply Growth are two different concepts! Please Read!,"I just wanted to clarify one thing. Dogecoin is NOT an ""inflationary currency."" The supply of Doge has a fixed rate of growth that is above zero, but this is not nearly enough information to predict what sorts of  inflation or deflation the currency will experience along its journey to the moon.
  
This may seem like semantics, but I think people are actually pretty confused about what the recent coin cap decision means. To be sure, the supply of the currency affects how inflationary it is. But so does the demand!! It's possible to have a currency whose supply grows forever, but (if this rate is small enough) is still deflationary. Just imagine if the Federal Reserve only added $10 to the American money supply each year. Since the economy is growing much more quickly than the money supply in this example, the dollar would experience massive deflation. (i.e. Prices would fall as the dollar became more valuable.) On the flip side, it's possible for a currency with a capped supply to experience a HUGE inflation. Just imagine what would happen if one day everyone decided they didn't want to hold anymore Bitcoin. You'd see the value of the currency drop dramatically (inflation), and you'd need to hand over many more Bitcoin for the same amount of cocaine or murders you were trying to purchase.
  
So the recent decision not to cap the total number of Doge doesn't make the currency inflationary or deflationary. It merely sets the money supply growth rate at a fixed amount. In fact, there's nothing special about a 0% growth rate (which is the same thing as a hard cap on the supply). The 0 point just stands out a bit psychologically. So it's really no big deal!!",cryptocurrency,1391495774
personalfinance,Help me allocate our inconsistent income to its proper locations,"I keep asking myself how I got here.. I always thought I had decent spending habits but circumstance and some poor choices seem to have gotten me lost along the way. 

My husband and I moved from rural upstate NY (very low cost of living) to a major US city so he could attend a graduate program. The grad program is extremely specific and extremely expensive. Leaving the program is not an option. We had to take out PLUS loans just to pay the tuition, and I am aware we are just digging ourselves deeper into the pit, but we both feel strongly that this program will eventually be worth it for us.

The city life has been extremely expensive for us. We visited over the summer to try and find a cheap place but through a series of mishaps we didn't get anything we applied for. In a mad rush to make the move happen, we signed a lease for $1250/month when neither of us had jobs. We couldn't move in until after my husbands classes started, so we had to split up - he couch surfed here while I loaded the small Uhaul and drove from NY alone.

Since getting here in September I have applied to every damn job under the sun. I have a BS and thought it would be tough but possible to find a job. I spent the first 4 months applying, and then got really discouraged. In a panic, I cashed out my retirement from another job I had.. about 2k, losing %30 to taxes. I feel stupid about that now. I was babysitting as much as I possibly could just to get us by. I have since started some freelance work with ~8 week contracts making decent money (I've been in it for 4 weeks and I've made 4.5k, but work will be inconsistent at best) In order to make this work along with the babysitting I've been doing during the day, I work overnight. I am working about 90 hours a week, and I am completely exhausted. Getting my employer to actually pay me has been like pulling teeth. I am anxious about not getting another contract and how consistent this money will be. If I can get myself work consistently I feel like we have a chance at getting out of debt. 

We have about 8k in CC debt from the first few months we were here. I still have to put almost all daily expenses on the CC just so that I can be sure we have rent and utility money in our checking account. Hopefully with the new contract work this will change.

I paid down my school loans as fast as I could right out of college when I got a job, thinking I could be totally debt free.. so I owe about 2k now but I have paid ahead so much that the bill always shows up with $0.00 due, but I know interest is still accumulating daily so I send little bits here and there when I can. 

We had a car paid off (again, I paid aggressively when I was right out of college with a decent job) but were rear-ended and the car was totaled. We bought the same car again because we believed it to have saved our lives in the accident but ended up having to pay a lot out of pocket (financed) because it happened right before the move and could not be fixed in time. The claim did go through insurance but for various reasons they completely screwed us and we got way less than it was worth. We are about 15k in the hole for all of that. 

Husband has his whole undergrad in student loans plus accumulating grad school debt.. I estimate about 150k when it's all said and done, but I am too scared to even look/calculate.

We don't have cable. We pay $35/month for internet. I do have a smart phone for about $100/month but I feel that it would hurt my chances at getting contracts if I wasn't easily reachable by email and phone. I don't buy clothes unless they are super super clearance and neither of us have any vices- we don't even drink. 

That's it. In general, we don't buy a lot. We had some upfront moving costs because we sold almost everything we owned in NY. All purchases here were craigslist for cheap items because we know we won't be here forever but still needed a bed and a couch. We have one folding chair and a folding table we brought with us from NY. I just wanted to give an idea about how we live.. we don't have a fully furnished apartment with fine art on the walls etc. The most expensive things we own are our computers that we got 5 and 6 years ago, and a blendtec that was a gift.. wow. I feel poor after writing this all out. 


**My questions are:**

I know I need an emergency fund but is it more important to pay down my debt first? I really hate debt and I can't stand looking at the bills when they come. Is there an easy rule like a percent of income that should be going towards debt or a number I should target to keep in savings (monthly bills x3?)

If I have to put my daily living expenses on a CC, which one should I be using to maximize any perks they have? Right now I have an REI card and the only reason I use it is because it's the only one I have.. 

We shop at aldi, costco, etc and I really work hard to keep our food budget down. I don't have an exact number but every decision we have made since moving has been to try and keep costs as low as possible while still eating fairly healthy. Is it important to track food expenses if you're already pretty frugal about it? We do eat out about once a week to spend time together, as I am always busy running from one thing to the next. We spend about $20 (combined) at a fast-casual place like Chipotle. If we miss our ""date"", I start to feel like all I do is work, so I am not sure if I am willing to cut that out of our spending.

Just to make things more insane, we want to start a family soon but we feel as though we can't with everything so up in the air. I have given myself the completely arbitrary goal of putting 10k in savings after paying off our debt, and then I think I will feel like we might be able to have a kid or ten. I'm well aware that kids cost way more than this but I feel like thats a decent cushion. 

As money comes in from the contract gig I am really tempted to just leave it in my checking account and wait until I find another contract after this one. I don't know where that money should go to our debt, emergency, or just left there in case I can't find work again. 

In terms of investing and retirement: My husband has a few thousand dollars through 2 or 3 employers and I occasionally nag him to consolidate them or cash them out, because I think they will just get lost? I have no idea what I'm talking about though- so school me on that if you can. 

Also, please point out any mistakes I have made so that I can spare myself making them again.

I live in one of the poorest states in America, and I personally know students and faculty members who will suffer greatly from this change in policy.

I encourage all cryptocurrencies, especially dogecoin to consider making donations to a local elementary/middle school or to a social program specializing in child development. Right now, America's failing education and child development system needs help while the cryptocurrency needs new adoption from the U.S...these are areas that benefit EVERYONE.

This would be a huge win for both parties.TEACHERS BUY SUPPLIES WITH THEIR OWN MONEY, and some of the best teachers go overseas or pursue a different career in the states. Let's try to keep kids off the streets. But anyways, small-town media will go wild over a report of cryptocurrencies providing actual good for the community at the local level. I've introduced cryptocoins to several 4th and 5th grade classrooms - kids love cryptos! Kids love mining cryptos with their parent's assistance! This could help spark the amazing revolution.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans while in school... how are the payments applied?,"I'm currently still an undergrad, but I participate in a engineering co-op program, so I have a half decent income for a college student. 

My current plan has been to take out loans to cover my tuition, and use my co-op income to pay off my old loans (I was a student for two years before co-oping). My employer offers a 401k plan for co-ops, which I currently have $2500 in so far. So, I'm making the best of my financial situation right now, correct? I'm doing well in my major, and will likely be hired by my employer, so I'm not worried about finding a decent job after I graduate in a year. 

Anyway, here is my dilemma right now:

I now need an extra $1500 in tuition each semester because one of the grants I received has run out. That $1500 is on top of the maximum amount stafford loans I can receive. So, my options are to pay the $1500 in cash, or take out a student loan through Discover. 

However, if I pay the $1500 in cash, I will obviously not be able to use that to pay off my old federal loans. I'm being hesitant about refraining from paying off the 'old' federal loans, because paying off the interest on my federal loans can be deducted from my income taxes (currently have $1800 in interest). Also, it seems as though paying off my federal loan interest while I'm a student saves a shit ton of money? Every time I make a payment, the payment is deducted from the principle loan at the time the loan was distributed to me, and the interest is recalculated. 

**tl;dr I have 2 semesters of school left. Should I pay off $3000 in federal student loans and and take out a private loan to cover the rest of my tuition, or avoid a $3000 private loan at all costs? Also, how do student loans work anyway?**",finance,1391498244

We do not want to touch it until we need the money (house downpayment).

Our original plan was the following: Save up money to put 20% down on a 200k house ($40k). Assuming we get $ 10k in cash at the wedding and we both currently save roughly $3k a month combined a month, we plan to have that amount (and a sizable cushion) by March 1, 2015. After we move in and the dust settles, we would pay off the highest interest rate debt as soon as possible. My reasoning for this plan is that with mortgage interest rates still relatively low and my credit score pretty high it is the best time to buy. We also know the relative area we want to purchase our home.

However, what has me second guessing this plan is the fact that my student loans still exist and I could easily pay off $ 5,000 tomorrow. We could wait another year for a house (May 2016), however, mortgage interest rates would go up. Let’s say I could get a mortgage interest rate at 4.5% and in a year it goes up to 5.5% - that is a huge disadvantage over the life of the mortgage loan.

Well looking at it without the rose-colored glasses, I can absolutely see that we are heading down the path to bankruptcy if something doesn't change and soon. I think it's safe to say we have both been idiots about this, I haven't paid nearly as much as I should have to where our money is actually going and neither has my husband. We are both going to sit down every pay day and go through the budget together.

My husband and I spent a few hours looking over everything to figure out where to go from here. I calculated his and my income for the last 6 months and was surprised to find that we actually make more than I initially thought. My husband having a fluctuating income puts him on average at $3500/mo and I am actually closer to $2200/mo, so $5800 vs the $4800 I thought. This was the average for the last 6 months. My income is pretty much consistent, my husbands is the one that fluctuates, but it usually only fluctuates by a few hundred dollars, in the last 3 months his income has been Nov: $3200, Dec: $3500, Jan: $4200 (he gets paid weekly, so this is so much higher becuase we had 5 friday's in Jan.)

We heard back from the credit union we talked to about a loan, but they were only able to give us a personal loan for $7,000. We went to the actual bank and spoke directly with a lender who said they may be able to give us a home-equity loan for the full $17,000 since there is more collatoral if we default on the payments, and we decided to start the process of looking into that, the loan officer was very optimistic that we would be approved for this, but it will be a few days until we know for sure. If we are approved our combined payments would drop us down to $280 a month and the interest rate would be much, much lower than what we are paying right now, at 7%. The loan would be for 5 years. We could have looked at rolling our cars and my husbands loan into those payments as well, but both our car loans interest rates are at or lower than that. My car is 3.25% paid in 5 years, and my husband is 7% but his car loan is paid in 4 years anyway. Not to mention that I don't believe we have enough equity to get a big enough loan for that.


We have also dropped our cable/internet bill by over $100/mo, (we were actually paying around $230) and are still looking at other carriers for lower rates. Our cell phone bill is being dropped by $40/mo. I had already started looking into energy efficiency before all this happened, so our thermostat has been set to 68, (65 when we aren't home,) for the last few weeks, we'll see what impact it has on our next bill. A lot of you were surprised that it was so high, but we live in a fairly large house and it's -14 outside right now where we live which is the most likely reason. All of our appliances are engergy efficient appliances as well. I have also been better at making sure everything, (lights, tv, etc.) is turned off unless we are actually in the room and I'm going to start writing a grocery list and bringing a calculator so we can try and eliminate $100 off our monthly grocery bill. Our monthly gas bill for our cars is actually lower than I initially thought as well, it's more around $240 than $300

As far as budgeting our expenses I have started looking into some of the websites you guys mentioned like YNAB, etc and we are reading the Total Money Makeover together right now so we can get everything in line.

I would like some advice on what to do if the loan we applied for gets approved. If that happens and with the changes we have made by eliminating some of our other expenses, we will have an extra $500-$700 each month (based on the lowest income my husband typically brings in, if he has a better week obviously any extra will go towards that debt,) what would be the best thing to start paying more on? We still have my husbands old loan, which I found out more information on, and it is a lot worse than I initially thought. My husband is a high-end mechanic and has to have certain tools to do his job, unfortunately those tools are expensive and the loan he has is actually way more than I thought. The payments are closer to $540/mo on that loan and the balance is $19,000 with 6% interest rate, it should be paid off in around 5 years.... Our actual income explains why we have been able to afford this up to this point, we have both talked about this and agree that though he needs tools for work this amount is entirely excessive. He's going to close the accounts so he can't charge anymore and isn't going to buy any additional tools unless he can pay for it up front. 

We also have my husbands car loan which has a  balance of $22,445.75 and payments are $458.29/mo and interest at 7%, my car loan which is $15,447.55, payments are $282, interest is 3.25%. We are also getting $2800 back from our tax return this year, $1500 of which is going towards our emergency funds.

Again, thank you all for the support and help. I feel like we were close to drowning and you guys threw us a life raft. We just have to execute now and get things in line, even if our loan isn't approved we are going to get this done, it just might take a little longer than we want.

dogecoin,Yes. Dogeflation is a good thing.,"After initial concern about the lack of trustworthiness in doge, I've concluded that the lack of a cap on the number of doge is a good thing. 

1) A small coin inflation rate give doge something no other cryptos have.

People ask of every crypto, what does this one have that the others don't? Doge has this.

2) A small inflation rate keeps miners mining. 

I do not mine BTC nor LTC because the rewards of doing so have gotten so small. By keeping a permanent block reward, doge draws in new miners by giving them a little something for their effort. This is crucial to maintaining the network.

3) The inflation rate keeps doge fresh. 

Many BTC wallets have been dormant for years. Much of this may have to do with hoarding, but I suspect that much of it also has to do with lost hard drives, inaccessible wallets, etc. While this drives the rest of the BTC up, it also keeps coins from circulating. By ensuring that a supply of new coins continues, we also ensure that there is a supply that is being delivered to users who are active. To wit, the miners. If you want doge to be accepted, it has to be in the hands of people willing to spend it. 

4)  Dogeflation attracts new users. A lot of people start their cryptocoin obsession by trying to mine it, and then they start buying it and accepting it in their businesses. 10 years from now, you may be sitting on the moon enjoying a pina colada, but thats only going to happen to doge if the kids who are learning about cryptos can have a chance of getting their hands on any of it through mining. Wide scale adoption does more for doge than scarcity alone. A lot of things are scarce, they only have value if people want them, this makes people want to mine and use them.

5) It's still libertarian-friendly

I'm a libertarian, which is what attracted me to cryptos in the first place. The problem with government-issued scrip from a libertarian perspective is not that it is inflationary, the problem is that it's arbitrary. The fed money supply fluctuates based on the back-room dealings of a handful of men. After the fed inflates the money supply, it is handed out to the government's favored parties. With doge, the inflation rate is defined and distributed to those parties that assist the network. I do not know what the deflation rate will be with lost wallets and whatnot, but I imagine that the actual inflation rate will be much smaller than ~5%. We need to look at this as a payment network infrastructure charge.

6) We are still in the early adopter phase.

We need to stop trying to hide this issue. It's still early on and many new users weren't promised a cap. Advertise it as a feature. Doge can still be mined! No hardware arms race. Mine today, spend today! Dogecoin is free-to-play! We need more users, and if that means letting those users have a chance at acquiring a few coin through mining, even better. They want more, and they'll accept them in their business and buy them on the marketplace. Think about scaling and user adoption, and everything else will follow.

dogecoin,Dogecoin article on Ars Technica! (about inflation),"***The following is the copy/paste version of the article featured there, we should go there to comment there as well to engage with the general public***

http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/02/dogecoin-to-allow-annual-inflation-of-5-billion-coins-each-year-forever/

For the last two months, developers and users of Dogecoin, the shiba-themed altcoin (alternative Bitcoin), have been trying to hash out whether it should be an inflationary or deflationary currency. On Saturday, Jackson Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin, wrote on Github that the developer team would keep the code as it is—allowing for some limited inflation.

Most altcoins, as they’ve been designed so far, are deflationary. This means there’s a hard cap on the number of coins that will ever be in existence. Bitcoin, for example, is designed to not have any more bitcoins come into existence after 2040. Other variants (Litecoin) have similar setups. However, one of the downsides of deflation is that it essentially encourages hoarding, as the perceived real value of the currency increases over time. Accordingly, academic researchers showed last year that 64 percent of all bitcoins (PDF) have never been spent.

As Palmer wrote:

Based on everyone’s feedback, we’ve decided to leave the Dogecoin code base as it was originally released and not implement a change. The goal for the currency is to keep approximately 100 billion coins in circulation—thus after 100 billion dogecoins are created, rewards will continue at 10k each block. This will help maintain mining and stabilize the number of coins in circulation (considering lost wallets and various other ways coins may be destroyed) at 100 billion.
Palmer did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment.

“Now it’s going to be worthless”

Almost immediately, some Dogecoiners got upset, because each individual dogecoin will be worth less over time.

“Thanks for killing the profitability of the currency. Now it's going to be worthless in a couple of years and never reach the value of Bitcoin or even anywhere close,” wrote MadCold on Github.

“I'm strictly in it for the money. I bought in to massive amounts of Dogecoin when the price was cheap, expecting it to rise. So far it looks like the value of the currency is tanking. Nearly 10c per 1K over the past few hours. I still demand @ummjackson answer for what he's doing to ruin the Dogecoin currency.”

Still, others cheered the decision, as user shinekm did:

Fantastic decision. Now it has a realistic chance of becoming a usable currency instead of some bizarre speculative asset for early adopting hoarders. A win for basic economics. I'm still holding mine, as I was planning to anyway. I'd also like to thank the panic dumpers for spreading wealth to the incoming newbie shibes at discount prices. Such generosity.
Inflation is “actually a good thing”

Economists argue that given this decision, Dogecoin just might have a better chance of being used and transacted in the long-term. (After all, there's still just a handful of businesses that accept dogecoins as payment.)

“As long as it’s at a steady and predictable rate, you would want that inflation rate to more or less match the growth of the global economy,” James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University, told Ars. “In order for a currency to survive, it’s got to be useful. One of the problems we learned with gold standard was that it’s too inflexible—it takes too long for gold miners to dig it up out of the ground. Having a nice, steady, predictable money supply is actually a good thing.”

On the opposite end, other experts dismissed the entire altcoin concept at its core.

“Many of the newer designed e-coins are trying to correct the flaw in the Bitcoin design that has encouraged hoarding by adding a cost element if the currency is not circulated and also adjusting coins to a targeted inflation rate such as Dogecoin,” Mark Williams, a lecturer at Boston University, told Ars.

“Although many of these newer e-coins are a marked improvement over Bitcoin, they all fail to acknowledge that human behavior, not mathematical equations, drives markets. Until human behavior can be modeled, these models and coins can’t anticipate these actions. In general, virtual currencies are no substitute for central bankers that take into account quantitative and qualitative attributes when making monetary policy decisions that include money supply.”",cryptocurrency,1391533863
personalfinance,Cheap debt vs higher savings (DK),"Hi guys

So, my personal finances has gotten way more complicated the last couple of months. My SO and I had to leave our shared apartment due to getting jobs in different parts of the country, but we still have shared economy. I think we have a solid understanding of our economy, but it is nice to get fresh eyes on it. Before I lay out our situation, I need to tell you, that I am Danish and my SO American, living in Denmark. I will translate all figures into dollars for convenience.  Some of the numbers might seem high, but the Danish system is high income/high tax/ high cost of living

Income:
Me: 75.000 per year (take home per month = 3200 + 12 percent towards retirement)
SO: 72.000 per year (take home per month = 3100 + 12 percent towards retirement)
Danish tax rates for the curious: http://www.worktrotter.dk/component/content/article/2/268-tax-denmark-2013.html ( my income is 410.000 DKK; for reference 1 USD = 5,5 DKK)


Debt:
Me:
Student loan: 36.000 at 1 % interest (Danish student loan system) monthly expense = 225 
Bank loan: 3200 at 8 % interest, monthly expense = 225 
SO:
Student loan
20.000 at 10 %, monthly expense = 250

Accumulated loan pay offs = 700


Due to renting two apartments (at 800 dollars each, which is cheap) and a buttload of travel, expenses (train tickets around 500 a month), we only have around 3-400 dollars left after all expenses are paid. We could definitely tighten our budget if we wanted, bringing that number up to 5-600 a month without touching the travel money. We have around 2000 in savings in addition to 4500 laying around from me being overpaid at a previous job, which we do not know if we get to keep. My question is, should I put that money towards paying of debt? I want to pay of my bank loan first, since the interest rate is high, but I am not sure if it is smart to pay more into my student loans, since it is a 1 % loan or save up towards other purchases. My idea is that its stupid to pay off the ""cheap"" debt and then have to borrow money elsewhere ( for property, car etc.) later at a higher rate ?",finance,1391536793

If I understand taxes correctly, that means we get 10% federal taxes up to $17k, 15% up to $72k, then 25% for the rest.

So first bracket ($17,000 * 10%) = $1700

Second bracket (($72,000-$17,000) * 15%) = $8250

Third bracket (($107,000-$72,000) * 25%) = $8750

Total: $18,700

$18,700/$107,000 = $17% effective tax rate

Now if I look at my paycheck for last month, federal withholding/regular pay = 12.5%.

That's almost 5% difference. Is this why I always owe?

personalfinance,Advice for Paying off Credit Cards,"There are a lot of people posting in here about what to do when you're deep in debt - believe me, I was you 5 years ago. There was a lot of information out there and I didnt really know where to turn, so I figured out a lot of stuff the hard way. I had debts of all different kinds (student loan, car, credit card) at all different interest rates (.9%-20%) with varying balances. It took me about 11 months to pay off around 8k worth of credit card debt, and it wasnt easy.

First things first, when you're facing a big cc balance and you dont know what to do, realize it will take quite a while to finish off. You (most likely) didnt build up a 10k+ balance in 4 months, so you cant pay it off that quickly either. 

The thing that helped me the most was using balance transfer cards. I had 3 different cards to pay off, and was making minimum payments on all of the cards except the one that I wanted to pay off. Unfortunately, my minimum payments didnt really get me anywhere because of the high interest rate. I paid $150 as a minimum payment, and my balance would go down something like 32 dollars. 

After a few months of that I got serious and move the balance to a 0% interest card. Now, instead of my $150 payment dropping the balance by $32, it dropped the balance by $150. I was able to pay off balances much faster this way by having my payment actually go to the balance instead of insurance. You will have to pay a fee when doing this (usually 2-3% of balance transferred) but you'll easily make that up very quickly in interest payments skipped. 

Once you get your balance to a 0% card, you need to make sure you dont use the card you just transferred the balance on, and that you pay the card before the 0% offer is up or find a new card with a 0% offer. 

Keep doing this until your balances are paid off - The credit card companies have taken enough of your money in interest already.",finance,1391550196

personalfinance,My experience with SoFi (student loan refinancer),"I don't typically gush about financial products, but I wanted to share my experience with SoFi for anyone else out there who may be considering using them to refinance student loans. 

I'm a 2010 law school graduate with roughly $130k in student loans. I had consolidated my loans and had a 7.75% intereste rate. I was aggressive with my loan repayment but still felt like I was going nowhere because of the high interest payments. 

Saw an ad for SoFi on facebook and thought I'd take a look and do some research. After thoroughly reviewing their site and talking to some law school friends who had refinanced through them (they're not available at every school), I decided to submit an application.  Application process is easy enough. They ask for proof of identification, proof of address, a copy of your last paystub, and a payoff letter from your lender. Approval took just a couple of days and they give you a few weeks to review and finalize the application. SoFi customer service has been exceptional and they were quick to answer any issues I had. 

My rate as of today is 3.91%. I chose to go with the lower adjustable rate because it was capped at 8% (only 25 basis points over what I was paying already) and I thought that if LIBOR could stay low for at least a year or two, I could make some huge headway into knocking off my principal. The loan is repaid over 10 years versus 25 like some federal loans, but since I had been aggressive with my repayments, there wasn't much change. You should carefully read your application and understand that in exchange for a lower rate you give up some of your forbearance/deferrment options allowed under federally guaranteed loans.

Overally, I'm more than happy about the process. It was quick and easy. Their servicer (Tru Student) is good, but not great. They really need to move into the 21st century. They don't let you opt out of snail mail so you get a lot of paper notices. Plus, no Mint access which is a big minus for us finance nerds. Still, Tru student have been really easy to contact. When I e-mailed them about both of these issues, they got back to me in less than an hour. 

TL;DR

Pros: 
-Very competitive fixed/adjustable rates
-Good customer service
-Easy application process

Cons:
-Servicer needs to upgrade its technology
-Not available for every school
-You waive the few privileges provided by federal loans 
-Repayment is over 10 years versus 25, so your payments may go up.",finance,1391557871

personalfinance,I'm 25 and have inherited £105k. Parents want me to buy a flat but I see this as risky.,"I am 25 years old and have inherited £105k. I live in London (in the UK). I recently left my full time job (before I knew about this money) with the intention of becoming a freelance session musician, composer and audio engineer, which are all things I am highly skilled and experienced at. (However I am well aware that I may not make any money from this, and will return to a ""normal"" office job in a year or so if it doesn't work out). I am just at the cusp of starting to make money, but I have very little overheads so can't really invest this money in myself.

I live with my parents in London so don't need to pay rent, and also have about £2k saved up from my job which should last about 5-6 months as spending money. (To be honest, I seem to spend most of my money on socialising).

I have about £24k worth of student debt, at an interest rate of approx 3%. However, to those of you not from the UK, this debt is more like a tax that comes out of your monthly salary automatically, and you only have to pay it back when you are actually getting paid, and I think it even expires after 30 years (see http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=93,6678490&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL)

My parents are very keen to see me spend the £105k on a buy-to-let property. However, I see this as very risky and likely to lose money. In London, I would just about be able to afford a one bedroom flat far out in the suburbs, that I wouldn't want to live in myself. While I think property in central London is a safe investment, I don't see property further out as safe at all and would also worry about finding tenants. The cost of a lawyer, repairs, furniture, insurance etc combined with the hassle of organising it (which I do not have time to do at all) all put me off massively.

I basically just don't believe that the current gentrification trend for London suburbs will carry on forever, and the root causes of 2007 have not been corrected and in fact are worse.

What I would like to do with this money is invest it in a way that just about beats inflation, but isn't too risky, until I'm in a better position to know what to do with it. That could either be putting a deposit on a more expensive property once I am making money again, or even investing in a technology start up (aside from the music I also have a computer science degree and am a competent programmer, and my programmer friends are always throwing ideas around, most of which I'm very skeptical of, but who knows).

personalfinance,"Should you A) Contribute to a 401k, or B) Pay off student loans?","TL;DR - If your employer offers a 401k match it is worthwhile to take it over paying debt.  If your employer does not offer a match, it is still a good tool for saving for retirement but your risk free return will not outweigh any debt interest.  An exception to this rule is if you have student loans to pay - in some situations where you are within the phase out limits it may be worthwhile to contribute to a 401k without a match in order to bring your taxable income low enough so that you may claim the entire deduction.

**Introduction**

As someone who is in the process of paying off student loans I did some analysis on a few different situations.  Many people come here and ask related questions so I thought I would share my findings.  The following analysis shows comparisons between paying down debt, contributing to a 401k with a match, and contributing to a 401k without a match.

For all of the following comparisons I've made the following assumptions.  First, the marginal tax rate of the person we are analyzing is 25%.  When in retirement the 401k distributions will be taxed at that same 25% rate.  Your situation will probably vary.  If you expect that this money will be taxed at a lower rate then your ROIs as shown below would be higher.

ROI is always calculated as the return of a situation compared to the first situation in each example.  This is calculated as (Total 2 - Total 1) / (Net Income 1 - Net Income 2).

The final assumption is that **any money not contributed to a 401k would instead be used to pay down debt.**  This comparison is meant as an opportunity cost between debt repayment and 401k contributions.

**Example A (Salary = $50k/year)**

This is a simple comparison showing that contributions to a 401k with no match have no added benefit in our situation.  Since our imaginary loans have an interest rate higher than zero we can see it is best to pay the loans before contributing.

Situation 1:  Pay off loans.
Situation 2:  Contribute 10% to 401k.

           | Situation 1 | Situation 2
-----------|------------:|-----------:
Net Income | 50000       | 45000
401k Cont. | 0           | 5000
Total      | 50000       | 50000
ROI        |             | 0%

**Example B**

Now let's add to this by saying that our employer matches 50% up to 6%.  That means if we contribute 6% to our 401k then our employer will add 3% of our salary to that balance.

Situation 1:  Pay off loans.
Situation 2:  Contribute 6% to 401k.
Situation 3:  Contribute 10% to 401k.

           | Situation 1 | Situation 2 | Situation 3
-----------|------------:|------------:|-----------:
Net Income | 50000       | 47000       | 45000
401k Cont. | 0           | 3000        | 5000
401k Match | 0           | 1500        | 1500
Total      | 50000       | 51500       | 51500
ROI        |          | 50%         | 30%

We can see here that as we increase our contributions beyond the limit of the match our ROI starts to drop off.  In fact if we calculate the marginal ROI between situation 2 and 3 we would see that is 0%.

**Example C**

This is where it starts to get interesting.  As we saw in the previous examples contributing to a 401k that has an employer match is basically free money with a return that you won't beat without high levels of risk.  In this situation we have an employee who is within the limits of phase out for the student loan interest deduction.  Does it make sense for this person to contribute to a 401k to reduce taxable income so they can reach the whole deduction?

In this example we are making the assumption that we have paid a full $2500 of interest for student loans.  The phase out for the deduction is between $65000 and $80000 (2014 limits).

Situation 1:  No 401k contribution.
Situation 2:  401k contribution to reach the lower limit of the phase out, no match.
Situation 3:  401k contribution to reach the lower limit of the phase out, 50% match.

           | Situation 1 | Situation 2 | Situation 3
-----------|------------:|------------:|-----------:
Net Income | 70000       | 65000       | 65000
401k Cont. | 0           | 5000        | 5000
401k Match | 0           | 0           | 2500
SL Refund* | 416         | 625         | 625
Total      | 70416       | 70625       | 73125
ROI        |          | 4.1%        | 54.1%

This example illustrates that in some situations it might be worthwhile to contribute to a non-matching 401k instead of paying extra on debt.  In the given example we can see that your debt would need to have an interest rate lower than 4.3% for it to be worthwhile.  There are definitely some people out there that have student loans below this threshold (unfortunately I am not one of those people).

* Interest Paid x (percentage of phase out remaining).  In the case of situation 1 we are 33% into the phase out which means we can claim 66% of the deduction so we have 2500 * .66 =  1650.  Since the marginal tax rate associated with this salary is 25% we calculate the refund would be $416.

**Example D**

Lastly I want to show why the advice is always given to contribute to the employer match if you have one before paying down loans.

Situation 1:  Contribute to 401k to match (50% to 6%)
Situation 2:  401k contribution to reach the lower limit of the phase out, match is 50% to 6%.

           | Situation 1 | Situation 3
-----------|------------:|-----------:
Net Income | 65800       | 65000
401k Cont. | 4200        | 5000
401k Match | 2100        | 2100
SL Refund* | 591         | 625
Total      | 72691       | 72725
ROI        |             | 4.25%

This example shows that once we reach the threshold for our 401k match we still have some benefit to contributing further due to the student loan deduction, but it is fairly minimal and may not beat the interest rate on our loans.  If we did not have the deduction we would see no added benefit similar to the comparison between Situations 2 and 3 in example #2.

news,Solutions to World Hunger - Food for Life Global,"According to the survey done by World Health Organization (WHO), more than one billion people globally live in poverty today.
Increase in poverty has meant increased malnutrition. In the African subcontinent, among one in every four human beings is malnourished. In Latin America, nearly one out of every eight people goes to bed hungry each night. In Asia and the Pacific, 28 percent of the people border on starvation, experiencing the gnawing pain of perpetual hunger. In the Near East, one in ten people are underfed.
There are 1.02 billion undernourished people in the world today. That means one in nearly six people do not get enough food to be healthy and lead an active life. Hunger and malnutrition are in fact the number one risk to the health worldwide - greater than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. Among the key causes of hunger are natural disasters, conflict, poverty, poor agricultural infrastructure and over-exploitation of the environment. Recently, financial and economic crises have pushed more people into hunger. Hunger does not only weigh on the individual. 
Among the Millennium Development Goals which the United Nations has set for the 21st century, halving the proportion of hunger people in the world is top of the list. Whereas good progress was made in reducing chronic hunger in the 1980's and the first half of the 1990's, hunger has been slowly but steadily rising for the past decade.
Indeed, despite the noble efforts of the WFP and tens of thousands of individuals, World hunger remains a grave problem. The compelling truth is this: never before in human history has such a large percentage of our species-nearly 20 percent-been malnourished. Each year, between 40 million and 60 million people around the world die from hunger and related diseases. 
The right to good nutrition:
Reaching the benefits of nutrition may be from a clinical viewpoint, ensuring good nutrition is also a matter of international law. The right to proper nutrition is most emphatically proclaimed in the UN's 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. Under the Convention, virtually every government in the world recognizes the right of all children to the highest attainable standard of health, specifically including the right to good nutrition.

personalfinance,Should I declare bankruptcy?,"Over seven years ago, I was in a near fatal car accident and have been trying to dig myself out of a financial hole ever since.  The accident happened in between jobs and resulted in over four years of recovery, unemployment, and debt.

I make decent money now and have decent health insurance, but still find myself living week to week and constantly falling behind.  My wife doesn't work due to the birth of our newborn son just last week.  Her income potential isn't much higher than the cost of day care, so she may not return to work for awhile.  Then this week I learned that my past credit card debt is seeking to garnish my wages.  I'm not sure I'll be able to survive on any less than I make now, especially with a child.  Which is why I'm considering bankruptcy.  But we would also like to purchase a house some day and I don't want to ruin our chances.

The amount sought by the garnishment is $2853.17.  I live in Michigan and as I understand it, they can take up to 25% of my weekly wages.

My goal is to eliminate our debt and put money away for our future.  We have no emergency fund and have one credit card with a very poor interest rate and a $300 credit limit, used for emergencies only.  We try to pay this card off in full every month.  I would also like to save enough to have some disposable income at some point.  

We have two main problems with getting into a better financial situation, beyond just being bad at following a proper budget.

First, it seems like something always comes up that adds to our monthly expenses and prevents us from getting ahead.  We rarely buy things that we want, and mainly buy things that we need.  For example, with the birth of our son, we had to buy a crib, stroller, car seat, dresser / changing table, glider, pack and play, diapers, clothes, etc etc.  My wife had to buy maternity clothes and new shoes, since her's didn't fit any more.  We've had a large increase in medical bills during this time as well, which we are currently behind on.

Second, too many of our bills fall into the first of the month, which puts us into a pattern of overdrawing our account to cover them.  Then we enter the second half of the month with a negative balance to recover from.  The first half of the month includes Rent ($899), Car Payment ($319), Insurance ($160), Cell Phone ($120), Internet ($80), and I may be forgetting something else.  But then we also have the cost of food, fuel, and possibly prescriptions to get us to the next pay period.

dogecoin,Of Wolves And Weasels - Day 29 - The Moon In All Its Glory,"Hey All, GoodShibe here!

I'd like to start off today by sharing a fantastic bit of writing that I happened upon in the comment thread of one of my earlier posts -- I'd been thinking for a while about what 'The Moon' meant to us, whether it would would be an amount... or something more esoteric?  Something more abstract. 

I think /u/eggshellwhyte absolutely nails it in this piece, and that's why I wanted to share that with you here today.

What is 'The Moon'?

*""The moon means many things. It means an increase in price, AND a wide acceptance and usage of the currency. It also means breaking boundaries, and changing the consciousness of the people.*

*When the moon landings happened, every person on Earth was changed. We had seen the Earth from space. We had seen a feather and a hammer fall at the same speed. We had seen the Earth rise from the moon in the same way we see the moon rise every night.*

*One could say symbolically that money (moon-y) is actually moon worship. All value derives from the sun, the source of life and warmth on this planet. Just about everything that happens here, is possible because of the Sun.*

*The moon has no light of its own. and Moon-y has no inherent value. Money is a reflection of value that same way that the moon reflects the light of the sun.*

*What is the sun?? We are. The value in all things lies in the hearts of kind and skillful people.*

*To me, my TRUE definition of reaching the moon is when the Doge is so widespread in circulation that its conversion rate to USD doesn't even matter. People will say ""I can spend doge in every country in the world. If I invest in doge I invest in charity and generosity as well. Doge increases in value every year, why would I want a dollar?""*

*I saw a penny on the ground the other day. I often ignore them, but this time I picked it up. ""This is like 6 or 7 doge right here!"" I thought. Excited, I put it in my pocket. I laughed, because in that moment I obviously valued doge more than its fiat equivalent.*

*Shibes determine the value of doge, and already I think we value them more than the markets say they're ""worth"". Imagine how they'll be when we can buy anything and everything with them?""* -/u/eggshellwhyte

I think communication is one of those things that we take for granted in this information age, especially when it comes to the speed at which we receive said information.

It's kind of fun to go back and read some of those very early books and texts when writing and the printing press were first coming into their own - where authors would fill pages full of flowery prose that, while beautiful, did little to convey their message.  They were so caught up in the act of writing (and, granted, people of the day had much more time to sit back and enjoy good prose) that they would just go off on these writer-ly 'drum solos' that would last for pages, showing off their 'mad skills' without really getting much actual information across.

If you look at finance throughout history, it's sort of like that too.  Lots of pomp and circumstance and flowery ritual built around a very simple act of communication: 

Sending your money to someone else, somewhere else.

As we grow together, as our global community does, in fact, become more global, a lot of these 'old ways' of communication have simply fallen away.  And the ones that won't budge, well, we're simply moving around them.  Let them stand where they are, but now we don't need to go through them anymore.

And just as how the Internet revolutionized communication for all - no matter where you were in the world - our cryptocurrencies have revolutionized communication in the financial sector.  It's your money.  What you do with it is your decision.  You want to give it to a friend in Finland?  Done.  In seconds.  No 3-Day verification waiting, with each link in the chain carving out a chunk for themselves along the way.

Could you imagine sending a letter, with each link in the chain going 'hey, I really like that paragraph' or something?  Each taking the bits of your communication that they like for themselves as they pass your message along to its intended target?

Cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the act of sharing -- and none moreso, right now, than Dogecoin.

It's amazing to watch this sub as people marvel at the way we tip one another, how easily we 'throw around' our money.  I've seen some folks spill their bile over the 'half a cent' tips we share while missing the most important point: We're using money as a true form of communication.  Freely.  We like things?  We tip.  We like people?  We tip.

Charities?  We tip BIG.  Together.  En masse.  I remember seeing a comment thread (sorry, I couldn't find it!) where shibes were marveling at how much more they find themselves GIVING, in general.  But especially to charities.

Now some could pooh-pooh and say it's easy to 'give' when it's not 'real' money.

But I see it a different way.

I think, inherently, we don't *trust* these people with our money.  We don't want to give it to them and hope it gets where its needed.

We want to be a part of the fix ourselves.

And that's what cryptos do -- and what, in my humble opinion, Dogecoin does best.

Someone needs help?  Great!  What's their wallet address?  Help is on the way.

And, just that fast, there it is.

5 people.  10 people.  50 people.

All communicating, instantly, their acts of generosity - of kindness.

Maybe I'm a Romantic but I think that Humanity is, essentially - at its heart - Good.  And that much of the suffering in the world is actually exacerbated by our inability to get the help we *want to give* where it's needed, *when* its needed.  All of these folks who end up growing up suffering, hurt, damaged from the wreckage of our inability to *make it right* when it's needed, when it can do the most good.

So much of our financial communication is stalled, hampered by these Obelisks, these gatekeepers, that by the time our contributions get where they're needed, it's often far too late.  If those contributions even ever get there.

There are countless tales of charity money being absconded with by Warlords or opportunists.  Piles of rotting clothing baking in the sun, sent by people with smiling faces who didn't give a damn once they got their cut.

Dogecoin offers us a glimpse of a whole new world - a new perspective on sharing, on caring that, in my mind, literally re-defines what's possible for Humanity as a whole.

Our ability to respond to tragedy is now only as limited as the reach of the Internet (and SMS) - a reach that keeps on growing, every day.  

As our *currency* grows and gains acceptance, we become empowered to GIVE in ways that, when I think about them, it simply blows my noodle.

Those who need help get help.  Done.  End of story.

Conversely: You like someone's work?  Empower them to make more.  

Give them the tools to ditch their crappy 9-to-5 and *create more*.

We become the arbiters of what we want to see in the world.

If you'll allow me to go full-on 'crazy dreamer' mode for a moment, let me float this one by you:

There's lots of talk about how, eventually, we're all going to be 'replaced' in the workforce.  About how machines and robots will, more and more, be doing our work for us.  Jobs will become even more scarce... so, how will we make money?  

What will we do with ourselves as a species when we're not forced to work on factory lines or dig trenches or build buildings anymore?

Maybe the answer is: We'll mine it.

Wouldn't that just be the most amazing, brilliant step forward as a species?  

We use a tool that we've created, *Math*, to create a system of currency that both frees us and empowers us to enact our will on the world around us.

Maybe you, or your children, or their children's children will get to grow up in a world where they get to spend their time creating, thinking, dreaming. 

Empowered by those that find them, that enjoy their work.

I don't know what the future brings - but this is what I see when I look at that cute, furry little Shiba.  

I see hope for all of us.  I see it in every tip.  Every Dogesled.  Every kid who grows up with a Service Doge, because of you.  

Because you *believe* it should happen.

And you *can* make it happen.

*So you make it happen*.

And THAT's the Moon, to me, my friends.

That's the dream.

And we are going to make it real.

To the moon... *Together!*

I'm single, I only claimed myself as a dependent, etc.  So she then looks into my W-4 info, turns out for the year of 2013, I claimed 11 dependents according to her.  

She then asked why I put down 11, I replied that I didn't.  So I double check my W-4 that I submitted when I began work, and my 1 still stands.  
Somehow, I'm the one to blame for the sole purpose my negligence in finding this error with her system.  

Is there anything that can help my situation other than fill out another W-4, appoint with an CPA, and actually check my pay stub?

Edit: Net Pay, thank you sir for that correction.

Edit #2: I managed to sort this out with my Office Manager, unfortunately, I will have to pay the 1800.  That's why we have an emergency fund right?  Furthermore, my *allowances/exemptions have been changed to 1.  Thanks for all of your enlightening information.",finance,1391611965

personalfinance,"I think I might be overpaying(?) on student loans, input needed please!","So here's the situation. My mother took out four Direct Parent Plus loans at 7.9% interest over the four years I was getting my bachelors. From what I understand for these loans, repayment starts immediately after disbursement. So she seems to have been paying them back since I started as a freshman, although I am unsure of what her monthly payments were. I just graduated in May and started really taking control of everything. It was my agreement with her that after graduation, I would write her a check to cover the amount of the loan repayment, plus extra towards the principle if I can afford it. After all is said and done the total amount of principle taken out over the four years is ~$38000. Back in August, the loans were transferred from the federal to Nelnet. 

The amount of outstanding balance, which I assume includes interest, is $33232. However, Nelnet saying that the monthly payment for this is $578 for months 1-73. It is supposed to be in the Standard repayment plan, so 120 months. It makes sense given I was in school for four years, so there are 73 months remaining for repayment. However, every single online calculator I have used including the one on the studentloans.gov website, pegs the monthly payments in the $400-450 range, which makes a bit more sense to me.

I should also mention that my brother is currently in school and she took out loans for him totalling around ~120000 for the principle. They are also controlled by Nelnet. I'm wondering if they are including the payments for his loan along in with mine, but she has not received anything stating an amount for his loans. Online, the loans are listed under two groups because we went to different schools. Mine are Group A and his is B. It states the $578 for my group and $132 for his. 

I'm just very confused as to where this number of $578 is coming from. I even did an excel spreadsheet a while back of all of the accrued interest, and the payments seem like they should not be as high as they are. Especially because the first balance was not $38k, only  at the end of my senior year did it hit that amount. What should I do? I've tried talking to Nelnet and they essentially give me an ""it is what it is"" type of response, without offering any other help.

Don't get me wrong, I want to pay these loans off asap, but I do not want to be paying more than I need to in the long run. I hope I covered everything, any suggestions/input would be appreciated! Thanks!",finance,1391619920

State wise we are getting something back (I work in a different state just as a little extra detail) but federally we owe.  This is the second time that we owe in and I am not sure why.  Last year we were told that we owed because my wife put 2 under dependents (not sure why but she did it anyway).  Since then she has changed that to 0 and we figured we would be good and get something back.  Figuring them up now we still owe the feds however it is not as much.  We have included stuff like student loans, but we have no children and no assets really to help out. 

The weird thing about it though is that we were curious to see what we would get back individually so we just ran each of our taxes separate (didn't file of course) and we were each getting back over $1,000.  I thought being married was supposed to be a positive towards filing but instead it is hurting us tremendously.  I checked also and it doesn't look like we are bumped into a new tax bracket.  I am just looking for some answers to some degree at least so if anyone has any ideas why we owe when we are filing jointly compared to filing separately please inform me.",finance,1391625635

turns out that bitcoin is not such a novel idea after all.  at the turn of the last century (n.b. just before the big crash), Thomas Edison was pushing for a new currency.  seems he had some problem with the Fed and government control of currency.  at this point, i think we all should have serious concerns over any fiat currency!  particularly with the US unfunded liability somewhere north of 150T$.

the information below provides a terrific background story as to what the historical need for cryptos come from: to protect the integrity of our currencies and financial systems.  as important, the idea was to avoid letting all control over currencies fall into the hands of governments and/or powerful individuals / corporations.

personalfinance,((Story Time)) How I did 2 years worth of back taxes for free through H &amp; R block.,"So, for more than 2 decades the IRS had my wrong birth year on file. They somehow issued me a social in 1985, and listed my birth year as 1986. How does someone born in 1986 get a SSN issues in 1985??

On top of that, just after college I went through a phase in which I decided that filing annual taxes was stupid, and that there was no reason for me to do it. (pretty persuasive, huh?)

So for a couple years, I didn't file. I had withholdings taken from my paycheck, so it's not like I wasn't paying my taxes, I just wasn't filing anything. The obvious and immediate repercussion here is late fees. The worst case scenario is prison. I've learned my lesson. File your taxes people. 

After 2 years without filing, I got papers for the 3rd year, and sort of realized that I was being a massive idiot, and would end up much worse off if I didn't file the back taxes, but I didn't know how. I gathered all the paper work I could (This included calling HR department for a job I hadn't worked at in 2.5 years) and brought them over to H &amp; R block. 

They helped me process my previous year filings. Printed envelopes for me and everything. The whole thing (both years fed and state returns included) cost me $130. Much more than it should've been, but considering these were previous years taxes, I just wanted to make sure they were done right. My H &amp; R rep told me they couldn't determine the late fees, but once the filings get accepted the IRS will send me a bill for those. All I needed to do was sign everything and send it off with a check, so that's what I did. The checks were cashed pretty quickly, but every time I called to ask about the late fees they said that the filings weren't accepted, and it could take up to 6 weeks. 

After 10 weeks and still getting the same answer, I called and made them dig deeper. I wasn't waiting any longer, and needed resolution. They researched and discovered that my filings weren't accepted because the issue of my birth year being recorded wrong with the SSA. The IRS reported that information to H &amp; R block when the filings bounced back, but H &amp; R block never let me know that information. 

I then went through an 8 week process with the SSA, to revise my birthdate on record. This dragged on because my home states records were in the process of being digitized (so they started at 1900 and went forward in time, because obviously 113 year olds know what the fuck ""digitized"" means). 

After correcting the information with SSA, I resubmitted my returns, and finally got them accepted (5 months after first going to H &amp; R Block). The IRS sent me a bill for late fees, which I paid, but I realized that there was 5 extra months of late fees that really should have been waived due to SSA and H &amp; R Block's incompetencies, so I called H &amp; R Block to complain. 

I didn't get half way through my story before the rep cut me off and offered a full refund for all the filing fees I originally paid ($130). Pretty good customer service if you ask me. 

I guess, looking back, this is a story about exercising your consumer rights, but also about not letting those pesky little nuisances that you have no control over get in the way of your goals.

Sorry if this post isn't interesting, or well written. 

TL;DR: Me, IRS, SSA, and H &amp; R Block aren't perfect, but if you complain to big corporations, they will probably give you free stuff.",finance,1391628377

Say you plant a tree today and that tree will produce $100 USD in lumber after 10 years, what is that future $100 worth today? With 5% interest rates, $100 in 10 years are equivalent to $61.39 today. That’s why we value more things in the present, although this hasn’t always been the case. The following table completes his example:

    Risk-Free Rate	Est. Value in 10 years	Est. Value in 100 years
      Actual Value	$100                          $1000

Positive interest rates cause us to value short-term returns, and if there were negative interest rates the financial market would make us value things in the future more than in the present. With 0% interest rates we could value things in the future as much as we value them in the present: money wouldn’t have any effect on our “time preference,” which may change with the current circumstances of each person and his or her own priorities.

With positive interest rates it pays to be a vulture capitalist. Forests are clear-cut rather than sustainably harvested. Small businesses with real products are purchased, their machines are sold off to competitors, and the company is loaded down with impossible debts and left to die.

I'm financially stable but I don't have very much discretionary income. Every penny I earn goes towards bills or savings. Anyway, I have a couple questions.  

I recently opened a Roth IRA but I honestly have no idea what the purpose of it is, it looks like my money just sits there and I can choose to buy stocks, CDs, and mutual funds.  I don't know what to buy, I was told by my Dad to just do a Target Retirement Mutual Fund, but I don't currently have enough money to meet the minimum requirement.  Right now there is $525 in my IRA and I have it set to deposit $50 a month. 

I also have a savings account with $3,550 in it, however it's extremely low interest rate that will never get any higher (0.1%).  I have been considering moving the majority of that money to another bank with a higher interest rate, and continuing to deposit money in there regularly.  The purpose of my savings account to begin with was to save up for a car, but other things got in the way and that has not happened. What with the extremely low interest rate, I feel like there is no point whatsoever to even have my money in that account anymore.  I need to start saving more and building more interest.

personalfinance,Best strategy for managing medical school debt,"Hey PF, 

I'm a graduating medical student and I'm looking for some input on the best strategy for managing my current student debt as well as planning for the future.  

A bit about my current financial situation: I have a total student loan balance of $215k right now.  The breakdown of that is as follows:

    $125,000 in Federal loans at 6.8%
    $63,500 in Federal loans at 5 - 5.4%
    $26,500 in institutional loan with 4.0% or 5.0% interest which is deferred through residency

I also have a Roth IRA with a balance of ~$17k, and my understanding is that I can withdraw that without penalty for educational expenses, and I'm wondering if that would be a good idea.

I'm starting residency this summer, going into orthopedic surgery.  My gross income from here on out will be roughly (PGY = post-graduate year):

    PGY-1: $50,000
    PGY-2: $52,000
    PGY-3: $55,000
    PGY-4: $58,000
    PGY-5: $60,000
    PGY-6: $75,000 (fellowship)
    PGY-7+: ~$500,000

I'll likely be living in an expensive city during residency (I won't find out exactly where until late next month), so much of my income will go towards rent.  I realistically won't be able to afford paying more than ~$1,000 a month towards loans during residency (at least during the first years).

So, all that being said, my questions are these:

1. Should I cash in my IRA to pay down some of my 6.8% federal loans?
2. What payment strategies make the most sense for me?  I almost certainly won't be able to afford a flat 10-year plan, but does income-based repayment really make much sense for me given that my post-residency income will likely be high?  I can forebear federal loans during residency, but the interest accrues and it doesn't seem like the best strategy.  Should I look into refinancing these loans?  I know SoFi.com has a few options that might be reasonable, but I'm completely new at this.
3. Are there any investments I should be making in the meantime for the long term, or should paying down my loans be my primary goal?
4. Should I take all of my info to a personal financial advisor?

I've gone over my taxes and made sure I deducted everything I can, so I'm at peace with owing this money...this year. However, I want to avoid running into this situation again next year when I'm filing 2014 taxes. The way I see it, I have two options:

1) I can take that $2000, divide it by my pay period, and have that exact amount as extra withholding for my W-4 (our paychecks go to the same account, so I don't think it matters whose W-4 this is done on). This way I should get pretty close to $0 owed for 2014.

2) I can increase my pre-tax 401k contributions (I currently contribute 8% to get my employer's match) in order to lower my taxable income thus reducing the taxes I owe.

I have a feeling that if I go with #2, then my employer will adjust how much they take out of my paycheck and I will end up owing around the same amount of money, but I'm not sure mathematically how it'd work.

Long-time browser of this sub, but first time poster, and I need a little tax help.  I am using TurboTax Deluxe to do my taxes, as I have for the past three years.  

At my main, full-time job,  I earned $24741.24, and paid $1825.00 in federal tax.  I of course also payed taxes on Social Security ($1533) and Medicare ($358).  With this info in TurboTax, it shows that I owe approximately $200 in federal tax, which I think sounds about right.  However, in my job we get ""spiffs"", which is basically just extra money you get for making sales, and is NOT taxed the first time around.  This includes cash bonuses, and also a free bed.  My 1099-MISC shows in box 3, ""Other Income"" of $5207.27.  After putting this in, TurboTax jumps up and tells me I will be owing $1595 in federal taxes!  

That just seems like a huge jump to me, to owe $1300 on $5200 more in income?  Or maybe I am wrong? 

In the end what it comes down to, is that if I owe almost $1600 in federal taxes, and a couple hundred in state, that is $1800 that I need to come up with, that I just don't have!

personalfinance,Hospital bills WITH insurance (US),"Hey all - 

I've been doing a lot of searching on Reddit for previous threads in this general vein, and have come across quite a bit for uninsured patients with astronomical hospital bills, but none for patients with insurance.

My bill is not up in the triple, or even double, digits of the thousands. However, between the hospital bill itself, the three separate physician bills, and the radiology bill that I will receive regarding my 20-hour hospital stay, I know that it is going to be more than I am able to handle at the moment.

The problem is this - I am single and well above the federal poverty line. I have insurance that has already covered its 70%. Do I have any other options here? 

The threads I've read so far all say to haggle. But what does that consist of exactly? I would imagine that getting hold of an itemized bill would be the first step - but what then? Do I take it back to my insurance to see if they will cover more? I won't have any luck with the charity application, as I am well above the federal poverty cutoff. I don't have reduced income from missing work - I just burned through my time off. 

Does anyone have any tips or a more exact formula for haggling a bill when you already have insurance and the financial aid/charity app is not an option?

Thanks so much in advance. I am also crossposting to /r/Frugal  to see if there is any different perspective.",finance,1391647391

news,"The Koyal Training Group, Identity theft is a nightmare that can ruin lives","**LANCASTER** — Local law enforcement officials say [identity theft is a nightmare that can ruin](http://www.lancastereaglegazette.com/article/20140201/NEWS01/302010016/Identity-theft-nightmare-can-ruin-lives) its victims’ lives.

Unfortunately for Maryanne Sicat, of Lancaster, she is living that nightmare.

“For the last three years, I’ve been trying to clean up my credit and fix my finances and rebuild financially because I had my identity taken and used at several places,” she said.

Sicat has received bills from stores and utility companies for goods and services she did not purchase. Also, she was buying a television in 2013 at a big-box store and her telephone number came up under the name of a California man.

“One time is OK,” Sicat said. “The second store makes you wonder. But then every single store that I went to Christmas shopping, it was the same thing. So that’s why I started checking into it more.”

[Koyal Private Training Group](http://koyaltraininggroup.org/)

She has the name of the person she thinks is using her information but has no idea how the person got her phone number. So Sicat filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and the Lancaster Police Department, and she has become another identity [fraud](http://koyaltraininggroup.org/fraud.html) statistic.

The FTC said identity fraud is the top complaint it has dealt with in the past 13 years. It received 369,132 such complaints in 2012, or 18 percent of its total complaints. Identity fraud dwarfed complaints about debt collectors, which was in second place with 199,721, according to information the FTC provided.

Fairfield County Sheriff Dave Phalen said there have not been a large number of identity fraud and identity theft cases locally. However, that is little consolation to Sicat and others like her.

“Everything’s on credit,” she said. “So you can’t do anything. You can’t buy anything. It’s embarrassing, and it’s extremely frustrating because it makes me paranoid. I don’t trust anybody.”

[What is identity fraud?](http://koyaltraininggroup.tumblr.com/post/75632107326/the-koyal-training-group-the-long-reach-of-identity)

Detective James Nicolia, of the Fairfield County Sheriff’s Office, said identity fraud is when a person uses another’s identity for financial gain or to receive services illegally.

“If I were to go and take the sheriff’s name, for example, and get cable or phone service put into his name for my residence,” he said. “That is identity fraud and identity theft.”

Nicolia said a common reason someone becomes a victim is because they are not careful with their identification.

“You get a bill in the mail or a credit card offer, you throw in the trash,” he said. “It makes its way to the trash, and anybody can come along and take it at that point in time. It’s open property for anybody, and they can get a lot of your pertinent information that way, obviously. You get those credit offers — shred it.”

Phalen said identity thieves also can get information from telephone or email solicitations. He said thieves are looking for birth dates and Social Security numbers.

[FAIR CLAIMS TRAINING](http://koyaltraininggroup.org/fair.html)

Lancaster Police Chief Dave Bailey said another scam is when a thief will email someone claiming they have won a lottery or prize, oftentimes from a foreign country. However, there is no such prize.

“Before they’ll release the ‘prize,’ they’ll send you an email, a fraud of course, and say, ‘You need to pay us $2,200 American to pay for the European tax on your winnings. We also need your Social Security number, date of birth and your current address to verify your identity and where to send the check.’

“So you’ve just sent them $2,000 and you provided them your identifiers. Now they can get you two ways: They’ve got your cash and they can steal your ID. I don’t think people think of those things as part of the ID theft process, but they are.”",finance,1391651502

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Regulation: Allow me to give you an Idea of What Is at Stake/a Day in the Life of a Regulated Financial Professional,"**When people ask for Bitcoin to be regulated the way other financial services are, they are typically people who have little idea what that actually means or would mean to them.**

I’ve actually operated under those regulations for many years – let me give you an example using what I know best: the world of stockbrokers/ financial and investment advisors such as those who work for major brokerage firms.   (I was a FINRA General Securities Principal / Supervisor and Registered Rep for about 18 years – this group covers all stockbrokers and financial advisors at major investment firms)

**These examples are standard in this world:**

-	**EVERY piece of correspondence including email** and hard copy mail MUST be approved by a General Securities Principal before being sent -  “Nice having lunch Jim, look forward to discussing your IRA”
-	**Certain written materials, such as brochures, articles web pages or blog pages** ALSO have to be approved by a Compliance officer
-	In some cases **these materials have to ALSO** be approved by the regulators
-	**Any article, magazine or link** sent must be approved (and usually will not be)
-	**Licensed Registered Representatives must report the use of ALL outside personal email addresses and social media** -  if you do use social media, a compliance officer from your firm WILL review your posts for ANYTHING remotely related to investments or the economy -- some firms disallow all social media entirely even for personal use  -  **your work email** will be even more closely monitored
-	**Any public speaking event must be approved** ahead of time and all content, PowerPoint slides, invitations and a script must be approved
-	**Registered Representatives must regularly be fingerprinted,** take tests and engage in continuing education
-	**ALL activities done by a rep in his/ her personal time must be approved**: this includes sitting on non-profit board seats and clearly anything related to business such as being a minor partner in a coffee house or owning income real estate – anything more complex than this is most certain to be disapproved and not allowed by the firm
-	**If a client you have moves out of state** and you speak to him and are not licensed in that state, you have broken the law
-	**Registered Representatives are required to get** updated proof of ID and account information from every client on a regular basis even if they have known the client for years
-	**If an assistant who is not licensed answers a phone** and a client says to sell a mutual fund the assistant cannot accept that order
-	**All of your email is saved and reviewed by the firm – they will read it**
-	Registered Representatives must be fingerprinted, have a background check and **report annually at a compliance review which can take a couple of days** on all facets of their life and business – even something as simple as renegotiating a personal loan is considered material and failure to report it can result in serious action
-	**You are not allowed to donate to any politician, PAC or political cause unless you file a form explaining the donation**  
-	There are typically **multiple authorities** governing the actions of Registered Representatives this includes the DOL (for pension and 401k plans) the CFTC (for commodities) FINRA (formerly known as NASD), the exchanges, the SEC, the IRS in some cases and the State Securities Regulators in every state --- if the rep works at a bank they ALSO have FDIC, the Fed Reserve System and many other banking regulators – if a rep works with something like annuities, they ALSO need an insurance license and are governed by more regulations and the insurance commissioner
-	I have barely scratched the surface on all the other technical requirements and rules governing underwriting, trading etc.

**So lets just pretend that Bitcoin is regulated the way FINRA financial services are:**

-	It would be nearly impossible for any employed Bitcoin professional to comment on this forum legally

-	Permission would be needed before you spoke at or even attended any conference

-	You would need to submit everything you say or write to a compliance department for approval

-	You would need to have all your emails monitored and report even social media connections and email address

-	You’d have to check that you are properly registered in a state before speaking to a client there
Etc. etc. etc.

**Compliance costs total millions of dollars annually even for relatively small firms.  This is why we see very few brokerage and almost no banking start-ups.**

I could go on and on.

**Next time you hear someone say** “we need more regulation in order to help this space mature” take what they say with skepticism, especially if they have never actually lived and worked under such regulations.

This article opened my eyes to truly live below my means. I was raised in a lower middle income family and was taught that education was the key to success.. 



Fast forward to today, I worked my ass off and went to college for four years followed by a doctorate in another five years of school. My job pays me well since I am in a technical niche ($125,000/yr); however, I am in $200,000 of student loan debt. Average interest rate = 7%. My parents have no money or equity, so I can not borrow from them. The wealthy as well as banks can get essentially free loans. In fact, my brokerage account lets me borrow on my margin account at 7.8% while my grad plus loans is currently costing me 7.9%. I get that no credit check is necessary, but it is nearly impossible to get out of student debt. 

I really feel like this is another hurdle thrown in by the educational industrial system which continues to raise tuition as the gov't provides loans. 

You may look at me and think ""stop complaining,"" but for how long I stayed in school and worked hard to get in, I don't feel anywhere close to rich. I am taxed like I am rich, but my net worth is literally negative $160,000. 

I have the option of IBR or PAYE, but my loan amount will triple by the time I pay it off in 20 years. I would owe taxes on the forgiven amount which will be over 100,000. 

So I am left with paying down my student debt as fast as possible. And start investing in real estate and living well below my means. I still drive the car I had in high school (&gt;10 years ago), and I don't buy nice things. 

Is anyone else in the same position as me? Feeling like you've been taken advantage of by the system. But at the same time, I do have a bright future as long as I long as continue to stay focused on obtaining FI

I drive a 98 F-150 so no car payments.  Expenses each month vary depending on what I do over the weekend and stuff.  

Clearly paying rent and for the necessities is the most important thing to do, by if I do have some leftover money at the end of the month, lets say $50-$100, what should I do with it?

dogecoin,Why I think Dogecoin is here to stay.,"Hey everyone! So, I'm trying to be objective with this post, so I'll do my best to stay away from opinion type things and stick with hard facts.

So, why do I think that dogecoin is here to stay? 

* **Transaction volume.** With only being around for 2 months, our community has already dwarfed the number of transactions that bitcoin or any other altcoin sees. The ultimate point of a crypto*currency* is for people to **use it**. The suggestion that bitcoin will be hoarded seems to be true; people don't seem to spend it that much. That's great, but if it doesn't get used, people don't have a reason to accept it for transactions. When is the last time you went into a store and saw someone pay with a gold coin? Still, people stock up on them. So what they've done is turn it into a commodity instead of a currency. There's nothing inherently good or bad about that, but part of what makes a crypto-currency work is people using it as, well, a currency.

* **Our community.** It's awesome. Simple as that. When I first heard about doge in december, I wrote it off as another fad on 4chan that would go away in 2-3 days, especially when I saw people throwing around tens of thousands of coins in a shot. Plus, that was paired with a lot of rhetoric about getting rich from people who didn't really seem to understand how currency exchange, or economics worked in general. But, here we are! And oh man, this community is driving it forward. People are using paper wallets to spread the word. People are getting businesses to accept Dogecoin. People are starting businesses to support the community. People are getting netted in with pervasive tipping. That all points to this digging in for the long haul. Add into that all of the charity, which I'll talk about more in the next point, and I think it all points to good things in the future. Every 10 minutes you see a new reddit thread about a new shibe coming to the community.

* **Our branding.** Originally, I thought it was silly to use a meme as the basis for a currency. The people who were evangelizing dogecoin kept saying that it would succeed because it's cute and appealing. I thought that it ultimately would be shrugged off as unprofessional by most of the world. To be honest, I still think that it may be eventually (maybe a rebrand of an epic Shibe standing on a cliff, a-la-Lion King), but for now I appear to be wrong. See, half of what made things like siri successful is the goofy stuff you can do with it (""do you love me siri?""). We've become like the counterpoint to the way-too-stern bitcoin community. Where they're talking about smashing iPhones and boycotting apple because an app was banned, we're talking about sending people to the Olympics, getting aide dogs for kids, and digging wells. We're raising awareness of ourselves not through advertising, but by being a genuine benevolent force in the world. That's really **REALLY** powerful. Plus, we've had a bunch of fun slogans which reel even more people in. TO THE MOON! It's a rallying cry! But more than anything, we have painted ourselves as a powerful force. *Let's do so much good that the world at large doesn't want us to go away.* We're already seeing newsprint in major sources - when's the last time another alt-coin has done that outside of a tech journal?

* **The developers.** Let's give them their due. They had an idea, and it took off. But they've also been able to make hard decisions when necessary. It took cojones of steel to make the hard decision to become inflationary currency. It took willingness to sacrifice part of the community that they were very aware would jump ship when the news hit. And, you know what? A bunch of folks did jump ship. But that's part of leadership - you have to be able to make hard decisions not just for yourself, but for your entire community. They've also decided that we should continue to be a force for social good, and I totally support that.

So, combine all of these things, and I think we've found the crypto-currency recipe for success. We just have to keep going and run the course... **TO THE MOON**!

TL;DR: I think we're here to stay because people are actively using the currency, our community is awesome, we have great branding, and our developers have cojones.",cryptocurrency,1391708317

Am I taking crazy pills?","Every year for the past few years I've had a full refund of my federal taxes (~$6k direct deposit from the IRS coming once I file for 2013).  It looks like for 2013 I'll actually receive tax credits in excess of my tax bill (due to the additional child tax credit).  This is mostly due to the fact that I have two kids, my wife is a SAHM, and I max out a 457, max out an HSA, max out Trad IRA for both wife and I, and come close to maxing out a 403(b).

I decided to go back and redo my W-4 (originally done 6+ years ago when I was less aware of personal finances), went through the adjustments worksheet, and came up with 17 allowances.  I took the W-4 over to my HR department where they were incredulous that I had anything even over 10.  

However, if I don't expect to have any federal tax burden, shouldn't I essentially have zero withholding?  I look at what $6k DCA'ed over the last year would have done in my taxable Vanguard account and shake my head...

**Edit**: thanks to /u/Shinpah, I used the [online adjustments calculator](http://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/) and came up with 15.

dogecoin,"A groundbreaking fellow cryptocurrency is in dire need of help, and we can help them.","Some of you may know about Fedoracoin. It came out a couple weeks after Dogecoin did, and you probably thought it's dead and gone... nope! It has a very solid community and developer team backing it and keeping it alive, and actually had a *huge* price increase in the past two weeks, from 2 latoshi to ~50 latoshi. They've got a payment system already made [w/ Fedoracoin](https://pay.withfedoraco.in/), and they've implemented a feature no other crypto has at this moment: coin mixing. To put it simply: You know how it's possible to track the movement of any amount of coins using the blockchain? With a coin mixer, it's impossible. This means completely anonymous transactions! 

They are having a huge problem right now, though. Because Fedoracoin has become so profitable, multipools have taken advantage of this and have caused a detrimental cycle:

1. Every 10 blocks, difficulty is changed based on how high the net hashrate is
2. The Fedoracoin difficulty is super low, making the coin very profitable
3. Multiple multipools jump in, increasing the difficulty from 10-20 to **over 1000**
4. After the difficulty rises, it's obviously not profitable to mine anymore, so the multipools leave 
5. The core supporters of the coin who are mining are left to handle this insanely high difficulty for the next 10 blocks, making the task of finding a block so hard that it can take hours, even days to find just ONE block
6. When the difficulty adjusts to be low again, the whole cycle repeats...

They've implemented a new difficulty algorithm that will take effect at block 51000, but right now they're only at block 50792. It took them hours to find just one block at the current difficulty of 277! If things don't change, this coin will stagnate for who knows how long.

personalfinance,When to hire a CPA or tax professional?,"My wife and I didn't withhold enough federal and state taxes (both of us get a W2 at the end of the year, only wages and salary for income). We file a joint return with 2 dependents. We owe very little on our mortgage and our itemized deductions aren't enough to get beyond the standard deduction. We both have employer sponsored 401K, but no IRA or Roth-IRA. We're looking at a small bill in April for about $1900 between state &amp; local taxes (my philosophy is ""better in my account than theirs, I'll write a check at the very last day""). I used to have a CPA do our taxes when my wife had a business and it was money well spent, but I'm wondering if it's worth the $200-ish fee it will cost to hire a CPA to see if they can reduce that $1900 estimate. My estimate comes from entering all W2 info into Turbo Tax. If I understand IRAs correctly, I could probably set one up and contribute the maximum to reduce the liability too, but I know that we wouldn't be able to contribute the $5500 or whatever maximum amount this year. Better to just keep the cost down with Turbo Tax or something similar and then file/pay before the deadline?",finance,1391721918

I had an idea some time ago to offer anyone (in partcular opponents/skeptics of Bitcoin, of course) to debate about Bitcoin.

I have been researching Bitcoin for about 3 years and now I do economic research and and consulting about it full time. I have been also writing comments all over the internet about it, wrote a master's thesis about it, have a blog. I have also been interviewed several times for magazines, radio and there are a bunch of interviews of me and lectures/conference presentations by me on youtube.

I imagine the debate would take place on google hangouts and maybe if there could be a moderator that would be great. I'm quite flexible with my time or the exact form of the debate. I don't want any money for it, and I'm even willing to finance the moderator/opponent from the donations I get for my blog (I don't think the donators would object to such a use of donations).

The company was bought for cash, so once the deal was finalized, I received essentially a paycheck for the amount the options were worth. Out of this paycheck, I had all the normal payroll taxes taken out. Federal, State, County, Medicare, Social Security.

personalfinance,Would leaving my job to further my education be financially unsound?,"I am 23 y/o and single. I have a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, and gross ~60k (with bonuses) in my current position. While on the low end of engineering salaries, it is a smaller company and I am awarded very volatile (440% gain in the past 2 years) stock options. The company does use this to justify its comparatively lower salaries. However, at my grant price, this only translates to an extra ~6k/year, if I sell at present market value. Of course, the higher ups here tell us that the stock will only continue rising, but its honestly a crapshoot.

I have been at this company for about a year now, and put bluntly, I hate my job. From my job experience, I am learning that R&amp;D is really where I want to be, and it's very hard to get there without a research degree (MS, but probably PhD).

Fortunately for me, in my senior year of my undergrad, I submitted some applications to PhD programs. I got an offer from a top ranked school, but ultimately chose to defer enrollment in favor of this job (this was probably the wrong call). I've kept up conversations with some professors there, and I now have the opportunity to start a PhD this summer. Full tuition waiver, and ~29k/year stipend.

I am nervous about this salary, as it is essentially guaranteed for the next 5 years. In other words, I will definitely not make more than 30k until age 28-30, if that illustrates my concern better. There is no guaranteed employment after completion either. When I consider the fact that I can easily invest ~15-20k of my salary every year, and am young enough to afford the risk in aggressive ETF's, it is very likely graduate school will never pay off in the financial sense.

To give some more background to my current financial situation, I will have ~40k (additional 4-5k if I sell my stock options) in savings at the proposed start of my graduate school career (extrapolating my current saving rates, I am completely aware his is way too much to have in a savings account). I currently still have 21k in student loans, however, these are federally subsidized. I am currently in the last month of their grace period.

I feel things get tricky here. If I go back to school full time, my loan payments will be deferred and the loans themselves will not accrue interest while I am in school. My thinking right now is I'm better off making minimum payments until I start school again, and then pay nothing until I'm done in 4-5 years.

I feel like I'm starting to ramble. The main issue is I am nervous about taking such a big income hit for essentially the remainder of my 20's. I always read about the value of compounding interest, and how saving in your 20's will benefit you for the rest of your life. I am stressed over the fact that my car will need to be replaced soon (although this could be a topic for another thread entirely) and I'm losing the freedom to drop cash on a new one and not sweat it.

As much as I dislike my job, I feel like leaving would be the irresponsible thing to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation in the grad school vs. job debate?",finance,1391733236

personalfinance,Inherited cash. Buy apt,"Alright, long time lurker here. I really love this subreddit. Hopefully you can help me understand this situation a little better.


**Situation:** Inherited 270,000. I am going to use this money to buy an apt. My budget for the apt is the 270,000. Wonder if I should buy an apartment cash or take on a mortgage that would most likely require me to put about half or more of the amount down. That would leave me with about 135,000 cash in hand. See Background below for more details.


**Background:**
* Age: 26, 

* USA, Chicago

* Pay: 2,800/month (hopefully a promotion soon, but not certain)

* Emergency fund: 10,000

* Savings: 20,000

* Debt: 0

* Savings rate: At this time, 0. I break even every month. Moved to new city, struggled to find work for a while. Now things are looking better for me.


**Paying cash:**

*Pros*

* Owning a house (intrinsically good), every dollar that comes in could potentially go to an investment account

* Easy, just go and buy the apt. No questions asked, nobody to report to

* Might help with the negotiation – apts usually sell quickly when they are reasonably priced in my area. The good ones go within a week.

* No rent, monthly expenses go down by a lot. Extra money could go into a Vanguard Index fund or a Roth acct.

*Cons*

* See benefits of Mortgage below



**Mortgage:**

*Pros*

* Have more leverage so I could invest. Financial advisor at my bank set up a meeting and urged me to invest the 135,000 I would have left

* Fin advisor said that a conservative portfolio should beat the interest rate in the mortgage and his 1%/year fee.

* Tax benefit (?, I hear about it, but in a mortgage calculator it said I would get about $20 a year and decrease to $1 in the end of 15 years)


*Cons*

* Don’t own a house, 

* Must hedge for issues down the line (life insurance) so if something were to happen I could continue paying. 

* The money that would be “free” would be locked into something else (life insurance, investment accounts).

* What if there are bad years in the economy? Not every year can be like 2013. What if my money decreases in my investment account?

* I feel that if I paid cash, I would have more cash in hand every month and greater ability to save in the end of the month. The amount that would beat or not beat the market (the net amount from investment – mortgage) would not justify the cost/annoyance of being not having the cash in hand.

* My financial situation would remain the same, even though I would “own” an apt and have a lot more money than I currently have, invested and potentially yielding returns.

So, it looks like I gave an incorrect account or had no money in it. I thought, oh hey an easy fix, but they wanted to charge me the full amount rather than over six months. I said screw this and fought with the representatives and they said too bad. So I went to a different company and am fully covered.

Flash forward,  I get a bill for $20 for the ""coverage"" I had for like one day before they cancelled it, and I called right now and they said it is a fee for ""insufficient funds"" and I had to pay it. I said no, get me the supervisor. Supposedly I'll get a call back within 24 hours.

This year, something changed somehow. While our state taxes are still pretty normal (we're actually getting a bit more back), the federal taxes come up saying we OWE $1709. I was a bit floored to see that, to say the least.

I received a promotion and a raise in 2013, and my wife also received a small raise, hence the $8500 difference. In that tax bracket (25%) of $8516 is $2129. I've looked over every paystub for 2013 (and the ones I can at least get my hands on from 2012) and it does appear that my tax withdrawl amount went up about $30/check starting the day I got the promotion, but that only accounted for an extra $570 over the course of the year. 

So my questions then are: 

* The extra amount due is due to the fact that we made more money this year, and that makes sense, but isn't my employer supposed to adjust how much they hold when a pay change occurs? Or is this something I need to do the math and account for if I get a raise/promotion?

* According to turbotax and the way they worded their instructions, it sounds like I'll owe an underpayment penalty. But then reading the IRS forms and taxact's instructions, they both say I'm clear since my taxes paid this year are greater than my taxes owed last year. So I don't *think* I'll owe a penalty as well, right?

* What do I need to do to have this not happen again? Change my withholdings? I could use some more info on that. I used the IRS withholding calculator and it told me to put like 15 for me and 8 for my wife, which sounds crazy.

personalfinance,W2 information doesn't match last paycheck stub ... Help !,"First off, sorry if this is a really dumb question or belongs elsewhere. 

Basically, I used the taxcaster from turbo tax to estimate my refund. My final paycheck from 2013 said I had a YTD Federal Withholding of $2604, but my W2 is showing a different amount, resulting in a less than projected return.

Also, I used as HSA this past year, and am not sure if that effects anything. 

Usually, I use TurboTaxes free version, but I'm just a little confused this year and don't want to mess anything up.

dogecoin,Using Doge to save dogs? Help homeless dogs with Doge!,"Wow... Much sad. So pain. Many tear....

Warning! Long post containing stories and links to pictures of mistreated dogs

Hi all 
My name is Patrik Durfors and i have been mining doge for a while( my first mining experience!) and lurking the community. I love the ""acts of kindness"" the Doge community has done, big and small. Buying pizzas for homeless, helping jamaicas sleighbob team and so on. 

It got me thinking, what could be more right than using Doge to help dog(e)s in need?
I come from sweden but im currently living in Budapest with my girlfriend. Hungary is a great country even if it has some political problems, but the view on dogs in some of the more rural and poor areas are unfortunately very bad.

There are alot of stray dogs in the country side and unfortunately its quite common that a family get a dog as a plaything for the kids. They tie the dog up in the yard and throw it a box or something to crawl under. Im not saying all arent caring loving dogowners, but ive also seen cases where the family were to poor to properly feed the dog, they love it and want to treat it right but when its between food for the dog and your children the dog gets nothing.

Neutering is very uncommon and the high amount of strays usually leads to pregnancy for the females. For some dogs this is a death sentence as the owner cant take care of the puppies and dont want the expenses. They are dumped, late in the pregnancy, on the side of the road, tied to a pole in the middle of a field or in the forest, sometimes with the puppies after she has given birth, and are left to die of starvation, cold or other animals. 
But not all is dark and grim. There are individuals that care for these poor dogs and want to give them a good life. 

We came in contact with one organisation helping these dogs a few months back, when my girlfriend accidentally found a facebook post from them. The organisation is called FAPF (Foundation of Animal Protection in Füzesabony). The post on the page was about a poor dog that was tied up outside a house with very little cover from wind and rain, that had been hit by a car 3weeks earlier. The ownera didnt take him to the vet and you could easily see he had damaged one of his legs. My girlfriend was crying over this poor dog, we talked about it and decided that this dog wont stay there one more night! We live in a small apartment and already had 2 small dogs in our appartment so we called up our cleaninglady/friend (she lives in an apartment we rent for her as she was homeless and living in a shelter, but thats another story) and asked if she would agree to take care of the dog for a while.

She said ofcourse, and 10 min later we were on our way to füzesabony. There we met Zsanett, one of the FAPF founders, and went together to pick up the dog. What amazed me was how friendly he was when we got there. You could see he was in pain but still came up to you, wagging his tail and wanted to greet you(https://scontent-a-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1/1422577_664221100266297_1606274559_n.jpg). We got him of the bedsheet they had tied around his neck while Zsanette talked to the owners. They finally agreed to hand him over, something Zsanett had been trying to get them to do for weeks now. We packed him into the backseat of our car and drove home to Budapest. Early next morning we took him to the vet. They examined him and got him into surgery right away. The leg was dislocated and the hip damaged. https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1/1238093_10151746494481750_602294061_n.jpg  Directly when he woke up he started wagging his tail and wanted to walk around and sniff everything and meet the people. 

This has continued and he is really a supernice dog that loves people and other dogs and loves being close to you. Kriszti, our friend that he is staying with, started sleeping on the floor with him. He wakes up at night sometimes, whining and walking around looking worried, but she hugs him untill he goes back to sleep. As we thought, kriszti decided to keep The dog and name him Bronx. He is a bundle of joy and such a great dog! https://scontent-b-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1/1468758_437520703036974_1081581153_n.jpg

After this we started to get involved with FAPF a little more. We transport several dogs to budapest almost on a weekly basis. Getting them to their final home or fosterparent. Theres alot of vetrinary students here in budapest that helps out by fostering the dogs untill they find a permanent home. This also prepares the dogs for living in the city(and indoors) .
When Zsanett asked if we could foster a little puppy that had been found abandoned under a staircase to an abandoned building we said yes, both me and my girlfriend knowing that he would probably be staying for ever. Thats how we got Micki, our third dog, https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1/1476419_440034836118894_75395390_n.jpg (here playing with Bronx big bone:). He was so thin and underfed when we got him , weighing only 1.5 kg, but quicklt gained weight and is now a happy healthy dog at 5 kilos!

Being involved with this kind of work often hurts. The cruelty and conditions you see dogs in is horrible, and some things just makes you feel so bad for them. Like Jacob, who FAPF heard about after he had been sitting next to his dead friend for five days. https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1/1625667_694791730542567_94545497_n.jpg .  But what you get back makes it all worth it.

For example clarissa, https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/t1/1004950_683409188347488_580056482_n.jpg (here with Zsanett). She was found next to the highway, to weak to stand up on her and bleeding from one eye. We transported her to a clinic in Budapest, she was laying in the backseat with me. At first she flinched when i touched her but after 10-15 minutes of gently stroking her she used what little strenght she had and slowly crawled up into my lap and pressed herself against me, letting out a sigh like she finaly felt safe and spent the rest of the ride like that. 
Or when you hand over a dog to their fosterparent or final parent and see the joy in their faces and how excited the dogs are. Also you get to meet alot of wonderful people who goes the extra miles and sacrifice time and money for these dogs. 

So why FAPF and not  any other organisation?
Well, ive never met an organization that consistantly get results (over 700 dogs rehomed all over Europe, with some going to Japan and other faraway countries) with  zero overhead and truly great people. Zsanett has a full scale kennel in her backyard housing several of the dogs that she and her sister takes care of. Several others are in rented kennel spaces in kennels they know take good care of the dogs. They both have full time jobs and take nothing from the organizations donations. They spend almost all of their free time on the dogs/working with the organization and expect nothing in return. There are no money that goes towards advertising. Facebook and some media attention they get being their prime sources of finding new owners. 10 dollars donated is 10 dollars directly to the care of the dogs. 

As soon as a dog comes into their care they are dewormed, chipped and vaccinated. As soon as possible neutered/spayed(dont know the right word in english). Any other kind of illness or injury is treated right away with the organization paying for operations etc. Unfortunately they doesnt get a better rate or anything but have to pay full price for all treatments. As you can understand this ammounts to quite large sums every months. They organize fosterparents and reimburse them for food, arrange travel to other european countries, trying to get the dogs there for free, but paying as a last resort and anything else the dogs might need. They interview and check all adopters and keep in touch with them afterwards, encouraging them to share photos and stories of their FAPF dog to make sure everything is running smoothly. And of course this is a NONKILL organization. Dogs are only put to sleep in case of extreme injury that isnt treatable and the dog is in extreme pain.
I feel much more comfortable giving my money to an organisation like this than one that has top of the line offices in the city center with hired people. 

This was posted yesterday evening and i think it illustrates pretty well what kind of people Zsanett and her sister is. Sacrificing alot for the dogs.This goes for all the other wonderful helpers as well. My girlfriend Frida went and picked up the dog this morning and got it to a Vet here in Budapest:

**How to help poor little doge?**
My idea is that I use my Doge wallet as a gatheringplace for donations and with your help, spread the word, get as much donations as possible during a month or so, sell all doge and donate this to the organisation. I will post the adress after ive gotten some feedback on this ( i will also donate the 60-70k i have for this)

**What i need help with**:

* As i said, im something of a noob in cryptocurrency circles, but have read up alot on it. However i would like to ask you, the community, that if you think this is a good idea and something you want to support, how should I set this up?

* I want to have as much transparency as possible, so i need tips on how to handle this in a way that shows this is for real and not some moneygrabbing scam. What do you need to trust me, so to speak? 

* Any more information needed?

* When time comes to sell the Doge, ofcourse some help with where i should sell it etc.

* Someone creating a webpage or something to track donations/amount/have some basic information that can be easily linked in other places.

* Spreading the word, papers, newssites anywhere thats possible

Feel free to send me an PM, add me on facebook or send a meessage there if you are wondering something and dont want to post here.

I'm currently a college junior, majoring in finance/minor accounting but hugely interested in buying/merchandising in the fashion industry (yes, I'm aware it pays far less than going the typical finance route, but I'm learning about it with an unpaid internship now and I love it).  I go to a top 10 business school, 3.67 GPA, so better than average here but not a standout. Finance is interesting, but I think I'd go crazy if I had to do it as a full time career; I'm still not ruling it out persay, but competition is intense where I'm from. I will definitely not go for management consulting, energy, or ibanking; I'm not at all interested in those fields or I rank too low in GPA to have a chance anyway. 

-----
I'm still digging around for internships but am currently under consideration for several department stores for their internship programs. Competition is crazy, so I don't have high expectations. I'm also talking to a Big 4 firm, but I'm not sure I'm a good enough fit. So I don't have a ""summer before senior year"" corporate internship secured like 60% of the kids do in my college, but I'm applying around like crazy. I am scared about finding an internship. 

-----
I worked in various jobs all my life to pay for my tuition/textbook costs; the rest my parents were able to cover. I saved up every penny I've made (or been gifted) since I was 6, and resold/returned gifts for money too (I was Scrooge as a child, I know). I most likely will not graduate with loans. So far my savings account is 40k, enough to live for one or two years if I can't find a job. If I can, I'm not sure how to go about this money. 

-----
I'm an excellent saver; that's how my parents, who started poor, grew their wealth and it rubbed off, perhaps too effectively. But the reason I chose to major in finance is because I am a bad spender and want to learn. My mom is concerned by my bare-bones style of living. I'm scared to go about investing, and I learn more about it from a corporate perspective than an individual one. I'm learning investment fundamentals in my classes right now, but it's still overwhelming.

-----
I'm also curious about retirement options... and emergency funds. I don't plan to buy my own property till I'm like mid thirties or can afford it, and I'm very adamant against kids because they're expensive and I dislike babies/kids pretty severely. 

So that's my situation....

1. What are my best options with my savings? Keep it in the savings account at a crazy low interest rate? A long term bond? Invest in stocks? Retirement? Find a good portfolio manager? 

2. Am I foolish to go for a career that pays much less but I think I'll enjoy more? My fellow finance peers roll their eyes at me saying I'm going for a path ""below our level"". But my education wasn't that expensive since I paid in-state public tuition... so my return on it doesn't have to be crazy high... 

3. What is the best plan of action if I am rejected from all of my companies?

I realized that I was actually past due on my first payment for Sallie Mae loans and now I'm looking at my options. I see IBR and Pay as you earn seem to be what I need right now, but I can't seem to see the real difference. 

My question is, from the studentloans.gov website, should I apply for both or one or the other? 

Also, will being past due hurt my chances? I can make the payment out of my savings (dwindling) but I didn't know if it would matter. Tag a long question, it says it'll take a couple weeks to pay, should I be prepared to make my next payment?

Also, what happens if I leave the program? I understand I have to apply every year, so if I do get the job and decide to leave the program will this hurt me? At my current income I don't think I'll even have any payments (per the estimator) so the fed should be covering my interest right? But what happens to the payments due? Can I just go back to making a lower payment, longer loan period plan (when I get my feet back on the ground)?

And finally, does anyone have any Sallie Mae specific advice for IBR or PAYE? 
I see on the Sallie Mae website a section to lower my payments, I'm nervous to fill out that before getting more info on the IBR and PAYE because I didn't want it to affect my application for that either.

I've been in damage control more or less for two weeks,feeling like pos. I've been working part time and probably going to be getting a second job to cover expenses short term but I could really use any advice available. I have been also reading about as much of my options as possible but I feel like they still leave me with more questions some times.

The subsidies that help low-income people buy expensive health insurance are a 'disincentive for people to work,"" Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told Congress on Wednesday.
""What the Affordable Care Act does, is to provide subsidies focused on lower- and lower-middle-income people to buy health insurance. And in order to encourage a sufficient number of people to buy an expensive product like health  insurance, the subsidies are fairly large in dollar terms. Those subsidies are then withdrawn over time -- withdrawn from people as their income rises.

Director Doug Elmendorf said during the hearing, “What the Affordable Care Act does is to provide subsidies, focused on lower and lower middle income people to buy health insurance.”

To encourage people to buy expensive health insurance, Elmendorf said the subsidies end up being “large in dollar terms.”
“By providing heavily subsidized insurance to people with very low income, and then withdrawing those subsidies as income rises, the act creates a disincentive for people to work,” he testified.

Elmendorf then went on to say that by reducing the available labor force, Obamacare will lower economic growth. It will reduce the number of hours worked in the economy by between 1.5% and 2% between 2017 and 2024.

http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/cbo-director-obamacare-creates-disincentive-people-work

What the CBO Director did not say, was that the vast majority of the subsidies will be paid for by the middle class - those earning between ~$40k and $100/$120k and young people earning more than ~$27k. These people are going to be paying higher Health Insurance premiums/deductibles (and some other things) to subsidize the Healthcare of the lower paid.

The CBO Director didn't say this because he wasn't asked this question by Congress.

The middle class are already tapped out because of government and Federal Reserve policies since 2001 and the fact that there are very few decently paying jobs being created. Real Household Incomes and Real median wages have seen very substantial declines over this period.

Any loss in middle class disposable incomes will feed almost immediately through into lower spending, lower GDP growth and fewer jobs.

We won't see the effects of this until the business fines are applied - they have been delayed until after the November 2014 elections.

There were 10 times as many people with employee coverage compared to private coverage before Obamacare came in. Only 5% of people bought private Healthcare Insurance before Obamacare.  

The garbage being spouted in the M$M about the latest CBO estimates on Obamacare

http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-garbage-being-spouted-in-mm-about.html

Summary

In essence the CBO have stated that over 2 million more, mainly middle class, people will voluntarily become more dependant on the State as a result of Obamacare.

This was always one of the main aims of Obamacare.
The way that Obamacare has been set up is a very strong disincentive to work hard. The more that you work and the more that you earn, the less Obamacare subsidy you will get.

People need to earn between about $12,000 and $30,000 a year to get a decently sized Obamacare subsidy. People earning more than about $30,000 are going to end up paying more for their private Healthcare Insurance (depending on their age).  Median male wages are now at the levels of 1970 at ~$31,000.

One of the main reasons in setting up Obamacare in the way that it is was to create more poor people by impoverishing the middle class and to increase people's dependency on the State. (Both of these increase the Democrat vote over the longer term.)

N.B. the other reasons that Obamacare was set up in the way that it is are :-

I was told this would be very easy for me to do myself and save money by not using an accountant and doing a 1040 EZ form.  I am using TurboTax if that matters.

This year I have received 3 W2s.  2 are from odd and end jobs I held throughout my senior year of college.  

For these two odd and end jobs, I have made $1,400 on Job #1, and $775 on Job #2.  

* For Job #1, Social security tax and medicare were withheld, along with $0.02 for state taxes (state of VA). No federal taxes were withheld. Also, boxes 12a, b, and c are blank.

* For Job #2, nothing was withheld with the exception of $6 of state income tax.  Boxes 12a, b, and c are blank.

After graduating college I secured a full time position with about $35k in taxable wages.  Taxes are withheld on this W2.  

So I guess my question is, is it necessary to file taxes on these two jobs?  I remember hearing something regarding not filing taxes on jobs in which you make less than a certain amount.  If that doesn't apply to me, I am assuming that I should be stating that $0 was withheld for federal tax, along with indicating 0 on boxes 12a, b and c.

personalfinance,stuck in income based student loan repayment limbo,"Would love some input on my student loan situation (which I've wasted a bit of time going back and forth on my own). I graduated with a masters in public admin in 2012 with about $52,000 in federal student loans ($6,000 of that is undergraduate and has been in repayment since 2008), 6.8% interest across the board.

At the time of my graduate work, I was working for a small nonprofit, qualifying me for the 10-year public service student loan forgiveness program. I started repaying my loans on an income-based repayment plan, which capped my payments at about $150 less than what I'd be paying just to cover the monthly interest.

Six months after graduating I was offered a great opportunity at a company that is a public service vendor (I still work closely with nonprofits/govt) but is not a public organization itself, disqualifying me for the 10 year forgiveness program. My intention is to reenter the public sector in another year or two, but this has put me in a weird position. I've been making my IBR payments for about 2 years (they are currently around $200, still less than breaking even on interest), and I'm more than $1000 more in debt than when I graduated. 

I could start a graduated repayment plan by not saving much of anything for the next couple years and cutting out all misc spending (see budget note below), and really hoping my income keeps up with the payment increases over the years. But my fear is if I do end up back in public sector, I would have forgone a few years of savings and a comfortable budget for making higher payments on a loan that will be forgiven anyway. Then again, if I continue with IBR and don’t end up in public sector, I will end up with a much higher loan than I started with and having to make payments for longer than I would if I just started the 10-year graduated payment plan earlier.

 It may seem stupid to make a financial plan based on future unknowns like a possible job in public sector, but this career move is very likely in my mind considering my education, work experience, and the professional network I'm currently building.

I’d appreciate any feedback on this!

Budget note: I'm pretty frugal already...I split my rent/utilities with two other people (~$600/month), have cut out cable and most misc expenditures other than a small allowance ($50/week) for going out, hair cuts, gifts, etc. and keep a tight food ($100/week) budget.

stocks,Obama allows marijuana sellers &amp; banks to do business....,"The Obama administration will soon announce regulations to make it easier for banks to do business with legal marijuana sellers, Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday.

""You don’t want just huge amounts of cash in these places. They want to be able to use the banking system,"" Holder said during an appearance at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. ""There’s a public safety component to this. Huge amounts of cash—substantial amounts of cash just kind of lying around with no place for it to be appropriately deposited is something that would worry me, just from a law enforcement perspective.""

While Holder spoke twice of new ""regulations"" that were being prepared, a Justice Department spokesman said later that the attorney general was referring to legal ""guidance"" for prosecutors and federal law enforcement. Such a legal memo wouldn't be enforceable in court and would amount to less than the kind of clear safe harbor many banks say they would want before accepting money from pot businesses.

The federal banking accommodation, being worked out jointly by the Justice and the Treasury departments, comes in the wake of decisions by voters in Colorado and Washington state to legalize the sale and possession of pot. The moves have created legal tensions, since marijuana remains illegal under federal law. One particular problem has been the refusal of banks to deal with pot-related businesses out of fears they will be accused of violating money laundering laws.

""We’re in the process now of working with our colleagues at the Treasury Department to come up with regulations that will deal with this issue,"" Holder said. He added that the new rules were likely to emerge ""very soon"" and were not intended to amount to a blessing of marijuana by the federal government. ""It is an attempt to deal with a reality that exists in these states,"" he said.

Holder did not specify whether the rules would apply only in the states which have broadly legalized marijuana, or also to states which have legalized it for medicinal use.

In August, the attorney general announced the Obama Administration would not seek to overturn the Colorado and Washington state measures. He said federal drug agents would continue to leave most drug law enforcement to local authorities and would focus on large drug operations, setting priorities that appeared to make it unlikely the feds would engage in aggressive enforcement in the states which have legalized pot.

Bitcoin,Netsolus Mines on Your Hardware for Fun and Profit,"On 12/22/2013, while administrating the Bitcoin controller network at the Netsolus data center, I discovered that at least 13 client bitcoin miners, on the ""Crow's Nest"" floor, were being hijacked and used to mine on the Eligius account 1PuPn9kVrBx5kFGoWbc58CEo7s4XQd1jgu. Checking that account I found that about 2 BTC had been paid out to it. I correlated this activity with a particular workstation, belonging to a particular employee, during that particular employee's shifts. There was little doubt as to who was doing this. And it didn't seem like something hard to solve. But then things got weird.

Right after I pull the encriminating logs, Delivery Man shows up at the NOC to relieve me and I inform him what I 've found. He says the last thing he wants is ""for your first experience in IT to be this cloak and dagger shit. Rogue Admin is a dangerous guy; he carries a gun."" Delivery Man wanted me to look the other way. But I told him that was ridiculous. So, he says he'll go upstairs and ask the three owners if they ""want to know."" And apparantley they do ""want to know."" So, I go upstairs.

I present the evidence to the three owners in a private meeting and they all agree that the employee in question will be fired. Furthermore, they acknowledge that my safety is dubious until this is sinched.

The next morning, Delivery Man invites me out to the spa. And it's there he tries to persuade me to just covering the whole thing up. And he gives a great motive for doing so: the company itself, not just the Rogue Admin, is also stealing from clients with workers like 'taran' and 'WhiteMountain' in slush's pool – workers who have made far more than 2 BTC, workers that churn on at least 1 TH round the clock. The Rogue Admin knows this, so even confronting him is out of the question.

My next shift, COO comes down insinuating the same thing: the Rogue Admin can't be fired. He insists that instead I should just install more thorough monitoring software, placating me. He tells me to put the linux tool snoopy on all the controllers, but not on ""Black Mesa"", the secret, supposedly far-away, location, staffed by an under-the-table employee, where hardware is shuffled to and from by Delivery Man every few weeks. (Yes, it really is called ""Black Mesa."")

So I put up the faux-monitoring, but not on Black Mesa, and then resume auditing the network as I had been, trying to build a catalog of all the hardware.

On New Year's Eve, the Crow's Nest has a brownout. I call On-Call Engineer and explain the situation. Eight hosts were down and other hosts were unstable, but it wasn't too bad. We'd only lost partial power. On-Call Engineer appeared shortly thereafter and turned the entire floor off. I told On-Call Engineer that all some 50 clients were down and he said that he knew and it was going to be at least a few days until they were back up because there was some “antique part” that ""exploded"" in the basement and they had to special order it.

The next night Delivery Man packed up a bunch of hardware from that floor and moved it to Black Mesa. I called building maintenance to check on the status of the power and they told me that he had talked with On-call Engineer about this a day ago, that there was no basement problem, and that it was instead a break in the line near the floor itself. So much for correlating hardware and clients. And, seriously, did someone actually cut power to feighn a brownout? Really? I couldn't believe it.

On 1/6/13 I show up and my security credentials are revoked. They say its a ""SOX compliance audit""-mistake. My supervisor and COO both come down with me into this little room, where I am literally cornered, and they start asking why I'm asking so many questions about where hardware goes in the middle of the night, and what kind of severance I want. I have a panic attack.

I ask to leave. COO tells me I have to stay. He just keeps pressing and pressing me. It's an interrogation. He wants to know what I know. I'm very upset. I finally get out, go downstairs to the lobby, and wait for a taxi. Then CEO and COO come down and pressure me again; more questions, more offers of severance, despite me asking to be left alone and being very obviously upset. Finally they yield and I get to go home.

Over the past month or so I've filed a report with the SEC, talked to two lawyers, two journalists, and the US Dept. of Labor. Everyone blows me off. They hear ""Bitcoin"" and just stop listening.

Forex,NormanConquest's Guide to the Australian Dollar,"Hey everybody! It's been a while since I did a big analysis post, and I've wanted to do this one for a while. I trade a lot of pairs, but the one I've  gotten to know best over the last couple of years is AUD/USD.

I intend this more as a guide for newbies, but I'd love to hear the more experienced guys' opinions, especially on the fundamentals.

Scroll to the bottom for the charts.

**Fundies**

Australia is a resource economy, with exports and tourism coming a close second. A weaker currency is always better for them. But it's a double-edged sword: it brings foreign capital in, which creates growth and jobs, but also pushes up inflation. 

Which necessitates raising interest rates. Which attracts more foreign capital. Australia has to, essentially, sacrifice price stability and a degree of control over monetary policy for domestic growth. You can see this in the standard of life in Australia:

Everything is expensive. But everyone earns a lot of money too. Salaries are comparatively high, and so is the standard of living. And it's because of all that foreign money that's been washing in for decades - partly the carry trade, partly investment in resources and tourism. 

But the more a weaker AUD helps the economy, the more this pushes up the value of the AUD. Which starts to become an economic headwind.

And so you get some form of competitive devaluation attempt from the RBA, like we've seen recently.

Now, however, the RBA has removed all the dovish rhetoric from its statements, and we are now likely to be able to expect a period of stable rates, followed by a cycle of hikes.

The RBA sees the worst as behind them, and the data should continue to improve, and the Australian dollar along with it. They are satisfied that things are going according to plan.

**Immediate risks (to the AUD, not necessarily Australia)**

The ones I see right on the horizon:

* The god damn unemployment rate http://www.tradingeconomics.com/australia/unemployment-rate
* Inflation http://www.tradingeconomics.com/australia/inflation-cpi
* Verbal intervention by the RBA
* Classic risk-off (not this weird de-leveraging BS we've mostly been seeing)

**Tail Risks**

A tail risk is a risk that is low probability and usually not immediate, but very high impact should it occur. Off the top of my head these ones stand out:

* Resources prices collapse
* China (main trade partner) is a source of considerable uncertainty to the market
* The EM crisis, which is not going away just because USD/TRY fell a bit, could begin to significantly affect Australia
* US Fed tapering could still destabilize markets, or cause significant volatility at least

**Some behavioural quirks**

I have noticed some things in trading AUD/USD, especially this last year, that I feel are worth mentioning.  Couple of things to think about:

* Price is (still) in a now mature and well-established down trend. Momentum on longer time frames is likely to be sluggish for a while yet.
* The AUD attracts carry interest, and given a lack of bearish drivers will usually melt upwards. 
* The market is generally more short than long. That's changed recently, however. Especially since a lot of those shorts were caught on this latest run up. It's 66% longs this week, down from 72% last week as the retail crowd sells this bounce aggressively.
* This creates potential for a short squeeze, but not necessarily a big one.
* AUD/USD loves to squeeze shorts, and it often does so early in the morning in thin liquidy. This can often lead to weak stops getting taken out, and creating many ""false breaks"" above whatever downward trend line you've drawn.

I use sentiment whenever I can - from SSI and stuff, but also just from twitter. I've noticed that when a lot of the more amateur people on my stream start banging on about AUD/USD longs, it's time to sell.

In fact, it is only in USD/CAD and AUD/USD where more traders are net short USD. AUD/USD retail open long positions: http://i.imgur.com/bR4lcl7.png

In the medium term, this indicates that AUD/USD is likely to continue to head lower. However if you're looking to get in on that when it happens, it is extremely difficult on lower time frames. 

**Generally consistent behaviours I have noticed:**

* Significant new lows are aggressively bought more often than followed through. Selling a major break lower almost never works.
* Shorts are squeezed usually beyond the point where short term tech becomes helpful. If you're looking at an hourly chart, you are likely to see major breakouts regularly. These are not reliable signals.
* With this in mind, picking 100% accurate levels to trade against becomes very difficult, regardless of your bias. I generally favour a much longer term approach, scaling in to positions with a very wide stop. Always to the short side.

Let's look at some charts.  Here's the daily:

http://i.imgur.com/lnYAxZk.png

We are currently operating within the downward sloping wedge defined since last year. Trend lines on lower time frames have generally performed badly, with many false breaks in both directions.

I've put the 55 and 100 Daily and Monthly moving averages on here, as these seem to be significant. As you can see, price broke above the 55MA but failed to hold above the 100MMA, a much more significant level. 

I've highlighted two significant supply/demand levels, and price is clearly closer to one than the other. Bears will have a harder time pressing the downside, simply because of this zone from about 0.8500 to 0.8650 or so. 

With this in mind, any break below the Jan 27 low should be treated as suspect, as there will no doubt be plenty of idiots waiting to hoover it up at these levels. 

Zooming in a little to the 4hr chart:

http://i.imgur.com/EkqXxud.png

This makes the technical picture a little clearer. Price carved a slightly rough downward channel for the last part of 2013 before breaking out of it in early Jan. We then tested this broken resistance line 3 times, until a low at the confluence of this line and the larger wedge formation. We now have what looks like a budding Inverse Head &amp; Shoulders forming. 

Price will either break above this resistance line at 0.9000 and hold above, or it will fail here, OR it will break above and then fail. These three scenarios all present trade opportunities.

Looking at a 2hr chart for a bit more detail:

http://i.imgur.com/cRejTOQ.png

Here we can see that the inverse head and shoulders target was hit at the confluence of the 55DMA, 100MMA and the neckline of the potential inverse H&amp;S I pointed out earlier.

Risk:Reward favours shorts at this level, against 0.9085, targeting 0.8750 or below. However, I believe that there is high potential to at least test the upside. A break of 0.9000 on a daily closing basis would be a bad sign. 

However, a break above and failure below this level would create an even better opportunity, as the retail crowd will undoubtedly buy into the break, adding more fuel to a rout if it happens. 

On a sustained break above 0.9000, a dip toward this level should be bought, with a stop below 0.8950 and targeting 0.9200.

Above 0.9200 we have our best opportunity to position ourselves for a greater decline. However, price could squeeze as high as 0.9300 - technically breaking out - before this happens.  

It could well break out and carry on, but I find that scenario unlikely given that the RBA simply will not stand by and allow the currency to appreciate wildly. It would be devastating for the economic recovery, and they have a duty to do what they can to prevent it - even if they claim they won't be fiddling with the exchange rate.

So, the trades are:

**On the short side:**

1) Short/medium term:

Observe Price Action at current levels. Another thing to mention is Daily RSI, which is very far from overbought. However it has come off overbought on the 4hr timeframe, with bearish divergence.

Should we get a test above 0.900 and a failure to close above, sell with a stop above the attempt higher or 0.8090, whichever is higher.

Targets of 0.88 - 0.8750, the Jan 27 low, and 0.8550

2) Longer term:

Begin building a short position on a break of 0.9000, attempting to sell each major rally.

Net stops above 0.9300

Targets of 0.8800, 0.8500, 0.8100

That's my ultimate trade here, but there are plenty of others.

**On the long side:**

1) Price fails here and heads lower right away.

Look for a higher low around 0.8800 - 0.8750 (which might be tricky to spot). This will be the bottom of the right shoulder, should we continue higher. Since this trade is against the larger trend, taking profits when possible should be a focus.

The first exit point is the neckline, which will then be coming in around 0.8900. The position could be added to again on a break and retest of this line. Targets to the upside are the previous swing highs and the wedge top.

2) Price breaks above immediately

Look for a hold of this demand zone. Observe price action throughout January and expect similar things to happen (multiple tests of the broken neckline, each slightly lower than the last).

Finding a level to trade against will be tricky, but I propose 0.8840, since a move to this area would probably negate the neckline break.

Target would be 0.9250 - I think anything above that is a bit ambitious.

**A note on the crosses**

I don't have the time or space to go into EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD here, but they are very interesting creatures.  Couple of things to remember:

* They move much more. Be careful. A 40 pip stop will work on AUD/USD sometimes. It will almost never work on the crosses. Think &gt;140 pips. Don't attempt to trade the short term charts unless you know exactly what you're doing.
* The moves are almost entirely AUD driven. As long as AUD is active, it sets the tone and direction. Nothing the Pound or Euro can do is likely to have a lasting impact. In fact, pure GBP or EUR moves that are counter to the current trend should usually be faded.",finance,1391948772

dogecoin,"Indie dev interested in supporting Dogecoin, but needs help!","Hi guys

I recently signed up to Reddit in order to access the Dogemarket (hence my quite silly name) and was surprised with how good a place it seemed to be for trading games, steam/origin codes etc. I then thought to myself, “wouldn't it be cool  if devs accepted Dogecoin directly for their games”.  So, on a whim, I pmed one of the guys over at one of my favourite devs, [Arcen Games](http://arcengames.com/w/), (AIWar being their most famous title) asking whether they would at all be interested in accepting Dogecoin in their store. Here was the reply:


**“Chris and I like the idea, and feel like there would be little downside to supporting it. The one hangup is that we don't have a way to then quickly deliver goods in an automated way when accepting dogecoin/bitcoin.  So there would have to be some sort of solution for that. I'm not at all privy to all the ins and outs of Bitcoin and other alternative digital payment formats, is this something you think we could find a solution to?”**


Now, being not very technically minded, I don't really have the solution to this problem – but hopefully some of you guys in the community do! Is there any information or possible solution available that the guys over at Arcen can use in order to help them integrate Dogecoin/Bitcoin into their store? If anyone has any expertise in the area and wants to contact Arcen directly you should be good to use this email address:

arcengamesATgmail.com

Or just post something in the comments. I'll direct the devs to this post.

I'm hoping that if these guys start accepting Dogecoin, then other game devs will follow suit.  Indie devs usually know other devs and if they adopt something that is working for them I'm sure others will also be inclined to do the same. 

Oh, Arcen's new upcoming sci-fi game The Last Federation involves spaceships... potentially moon-bound? Whatever, seems like a good omen. :)

Thanks guys, let's get Dogecoin accepted into their store.

**Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys. Hopefully this information will allow Arcen to start integrating support for Dogecoin/Bitcoin into their store. Oh, you can also contact Erik from Arcen via pm through his reddit name of /u/AragonLA if you wish to do so.**",cryptocurrency,1391960834

personalfinance,"My parents set up a Roth IRA account for me several years ago, didn't tell me and I finally got access to it today... so many questions.","I am quite confused at what my parents did with this Roth IRA account.  I was told by my father that he had opened it up several years ago (2007) and put $2500 in there.  Well, as of today, it has $2610 in it.  

I went in and poked around the site, American Century.  I downloaded the CSV of all the transactions that have occurred since the account was opened and it looks like the money is being invested in ""money market"".  I asked my father what it was and why it was invested in that particular way.  He said that it was a low yield, low risk investment and that I should stick to it for the low risk factor, but at a very low interest rate.  The Maintenance fee is $12.50/year and that negates almost any of the interest earned.  Obviously there is not a lot of money in there so the $12.50 makes it a huge hit on the returns.

[Here is a screenshot \(personal information removed\) of the CVS file I downloaded (edited for visual appeal).](http://imgur.com/OQkiGfs)

I just read the post from yesterday about Compound Returns with all the cool charts.  Well, everyone here talks about Vanguard-this and Vanguard-that.  So, I got to thinking that perhaps I should change my plan to Vanguard and NOT go with a ""Money Market"".

Here are my stats: Married, 32 years old, 1 child, renting a house, combined take home income of $7k/month, maximum contributions to 401k with both our respective employers, $0 credit card debt, $250/month car payment.  We have no IRA or Roth IRA account of our own **yet**.  I just recently got a higher paying job that affords us to start contributing to those accounts.  We are late and we will probably regret starting late on this, but it has to be done.  


So, my questions are:

-  Stick with American Century, but change the investment from Money Market to something else?

-  Move to Vanguard completely and invest there?

-  Based on my financial stats, what would be the better investment method?

Now that we are making good money, we have started saving to do the max contributions to our Roth IRA account for 2014.  We have set that money aside until we had a educated and informed decision as to how and where to put the Roth IRA money.",finance,1391967384

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin windfall - I feel like the ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" dog right now...","*Submited this to r/finance, but it was deleted pretty quickly.  Not sure exactly why...Anyway, here it is again in a place I think will be friendlier.*

I mined/bought a bunch of bitcoins in late 2010 early 2011 (long before the first crazy bubble to $30), and I’ve managed to hold on to them over the years.  A few weeks ago I finally decided it was time to realize profit and I liquidated a significant sum.  For my wife and I the amount I liquidated is a life changing sum of money, but I think I should avoid saying exactly how much.

A few months before I liquidated I engaged both a tax attorney and an accountant to help me understand my tax obligations and how to prepare for them.  I think I did my due diligence there.

For some perspective, we’re in our 30s, have a couple kids, and our combined income is modest.  We’re the lucky owners of home with an underwater mortgage.  We’ve faithfully paid on it to keep our credit scores from going to shit (our scores are both excellent).  We recently (but before this liquidation) bought a new car because one of our cars broke down, so we have one car payment at 0% interest (I think I did a decent job negotiating).  We have another vehicle, but it’s paid for.


*Here’s what we’ve done already and in this order:*

**(1)** *Sat down with an adviser at our bank and had the money organized into our savings account and a new money market account, at least for the time being, so that the full amount can be covered under FDIC.*

**(2)** *Set aside what we will owe in taxes (plus a little more to be safe) based on the advice of our tax attorney and accountant.*

**(3)** *Paid off all of our credit card debt.*

**(4)** *Paid off all of our student loans (most were just over 6% interest).*


**(5)**, which is in progress right now, is going to be getting out of this house and into something nicer and in a better more stable location, which is going to cost us, and which, thankfully, we can pay now (as much as it’s going to suck to have to write a huge check to the mortgage company).  I've worked out our new price range taking into account an amount we can put down that will allow us to significantly upgrade the quality of our living space, but without changing our mortgage payments from what they are now in our shitty house with our shitty interest rate from the height of the housing bubble (which is when we bought the house we're currently in).  

Aaaaaand that’s as far as I’ve gone.  After all that we will still have a significant sum left over and I just don’t know what to do with it.  I know I shouldn't just leave it sitting in savings and money market accounts, and the financial adviser at the bank has all kinds of ideas, but I don’t just want to go with whatever he says without more information.

I’m still pretty heavily invested in bitcoin, but with the amount from this recent liquidation I’d like to diversify into much (much, much, much, much…) less risky investments that can protect, or will be likely to protect, the value of what I’ve realized recently.  I seriously feel like the “I have no idea what I’m doing” dog right now, though I think I’ve made sensible choices up to this point.  Any advice?

investing,Right time to buy bonds?,"So I'm setting up my portfolio having read intelligent investor and some other books, but I'm a little unsure of how to deal with bonds given the current interest rate environment. I want to allocate *some* amount to bonds but given that interest rates are so low and basically have to go up in the next year or two, it seems dumb to put more than a small amount into bonds (like 5-10% not the 25%+ Graham suggests). 

My thought process is that yields are really low (I can find plenty of blue chips with better div yields) and when rates go up the value of any bonds I own will go down. That being said, given the run up in stocks and generally how expensive they are, I know that they can't continue to produce such large gains and will likely perform relatively poorly over the next 5-10 years. This leads me to believe that it would be foolish to not own bonds at some point. 

So my current strategy is to allocate the majority of my money to an index fund etf (VTI/VOO) with some smaller amount in bonds and alter the allocation if/when interest rates begin to increase. Does this make sense or should I not even bother to put any money in bonds right now and allocate the remainder of my portfolio to something like TIPS or a sector specific ETF?

I went to every website that has any of my bank/card info stored and replaced the password with a 125bit string of random characters. Hopefully that keeps things a bit more secure. I was definitely making the mistake of using the same insecure password for multiple accounts.

Anyway. After the second time my card info was compromised, I thought it would be wise to check my credit report and that's when things got really depressing.

Enough with the pleasantries, let's get to the meat of it!

There are a lot of questions regarding fiat money, for example:

* Why is it called fiat money?
* When was fiat money first used?
* How does fiat money retain its value?
* Where does fiat money come from?
* What advantages does fiat money have?
* Why are all reserve currencies fiat money?
* Is fiat money ""free""?
* Is fiat money stable?

I think these are some interesting questions and important qestions, so I'll just go through them one by one until I reach the character limit :) This post will be multi-part because there is a lot of ground to cover. Let's start with the first, and easiest, question: 

* Why is it called fiat money?

Let's get the easiest question out of the way first! ""Fiat"" is latin and means ""Let is be so"" or ""Let it become"". It was used in the bible with ""fiat lux"" which means ""Let there be light"", it is used in the expression ""ruling by fiat"" where fiat means decree. The money we use today is called fiat money because it is neither commodity money nor representative money, it can't be exchanged for specie except for buying specie. Representative money was exchangeable for a fixed amount of (usually) gold or silver.

Fiat money exists by decree of the government. It is the legal tender of a nation. Taxes are paid in fiat money, taxes are levied and counted in fiat money,  people are required (in general) to accept the fiat money of the country as a means of payment.

* When was fiat money first  used?

Fiat money is older than most people think! In one form or another it existed for almost 1000 years. Its first known use was in 11th century China. The way the system was implemented already included some modern considerations about monetary policy, such as money supply and the point that fiat money can gain value through the designation as legal tender.

Taxes were levied in fiat bills and a demurrage scheme was implemented which would render bills void after a three year period. At the end of this period the bill could be replaced for a small fee. This scheme was poorly implemented and lacked oversight. This meant that far too few bills were pulled from circulation. Consequently, the money supply increased far too quickly and price inflation took place.

It still continued to be used, albeit with silver and gold coins to complement the monetary supply. 

It took a longer time for fiat currency to gain a foothold in europe. Presumably due to the fact that the chinese were far more advanced in their organization of bureaucracy and more centralized than european nations at the time (This is my conjecture, but I think it plausible, given the fact that fiat relies on a societal trust and wide acceptance).

When it did, it didn't go over without a hitch. Numerous countries had to deal with runaway inflation (for example sweden in the 18th century) due to the unchecked printing of fiat money and most switched back to gold and silver coins or representative money. With the development of central banks in the 18th and 19th century the first real representative money with the backing of mature financial institutions was implemented. This period was fraught with deflation and particularly smaller countries had trouble guaranteeing the convertability of their bills (due to market pressures on gold and silver prices and the necessity to manage the balance of payments against other countries).

This led to a partial breakdown of gold standard systems in countries like argentina. Bank runs and economic stagnation were the consequence. But at the beginning of the 20th century, Europe faced its own problems with the first World War. A lot of governments suspended the convertability of their money into specie, which gradually changed into a purely fiat system. Without independent central banks however (I'll get to this very important point later), the political costs of printing more money remained vague and more money was printed. This led to the hyperinflation in Germany that ultimately led to the economic failure that would bring Adolf Hitler to power. 

After WWII, the Bretton-Woods system was implemented. Most currencies were pegged to the Dollar or convertable to bullion gold. $35 could be exchanged into one troy ounce of bullion gold by the central banks. Trade imbalances were supposed to be alleviated by gold exchanges and intervention by the International Monetary Fund. However this system collapsed in 1971 when the Fed under the Nixon administration suspended the convertability of USD into gold bullion. Since then, all reserve currencies are fiat money.

But enough about this (very abridged) history of fiat money! Why in the fuck does this system even work? I'll tell you why!

* How does fiat money retain its value?

Fiat money is different from commodity money because it has no intrinsic value, that much is easy to see. And yet it does have value! The USD even has so much value that is recognized world-wide, that it actually takes a place as a complementary money in a lot of countries that have a political climate that eroded a lot of trust into the central bank and governmental monetary policy.

If you ever go to Cambodia, don't bother exchanging your USD. Everybody will accept USD (even in Angkor Wat they prefer you to pay in USD) and things are often more expensive than they should be if you pay in Cambodien riel. It works similarly in Cuba, where USD are taken readily by local merchants and even preferred to the Peso.

How can that be? Let's take a step back and examine representative money for a second: It carries with it the promise that you are able at some point in the future to exchange this bill for a certain amount of commodity money, be it in the form of bullion gold, silver coins, gold coins, whatever. The bill itself is worthless, but it has the promise on it, that it can be exchanged for something that has worth. This promise carries with it some risk. If I accept this bill as payment, I might not be sure, that it can actually be honored by the issueing institution. This is why certain bills were only accepted with heavy discounts (See my previous 2 posts). However the stronger the promise is (due to a central bank which regulates other banks and guarantees the value for example), the less discount has to be applied. In fact if I don't really plan to exchange it anyway, but would rather use it as payment instead, this issue will be alleviated significantly! If I know that the value of the bill is guaranteed at the end, I expect it to be accepted without a discount. This chain can be perpetuated at infinitum and the result is that this bill was used as money countless times at  face value and without a discount.

If you remove the convertability, you would expect the value to plummet. However, designating the money as ""legal tender"" means that this is not the case. See, legal tender means all official accounting has to be done with this currency. That means governmental contracts are paid in fiat, it means that taxes have to be paid in fiat, it means that central banks only deal in fiat and it means that people in general have an obligation to accept fiat. This means there is already some value to fiat whether you expect it to be worth anything or not. While an individual might prefer to handle their business in another form that does not rely on the national fiat currency, they will still have to pay their taxes in fiat, they will most likely be paid in fiat and their bank will most likely also only deal in fiat if they want to have a loan.

The system relies on two factors to remain stable: The aforementioned preferrential status as legal tender and reliance on a stable monetary base. What does stable monetary base mean?As you noticed from my short history of fiat money, there have been a number of problems with inflation that is often associated to fiat money. Historical examples range from the Weimar Republic to Turkey, from Argentina to Zimbabwe. What these countries have in common is an irresponsible increase in money supply, a phenomenon economists refer to as ""political inflation"". Inflation is good politically. Inflation in the short term reduces unemployment (wages are ""sticky"" and thus work becomes cheaper), it can increase output in the short term and it reduces the real value of debt (Debt loses value based on the inflation rate unless it is specifically adjusted to inflation!). This means that being irresponsible with the increase in money supply far beyond the demand for money (Yes, there is something called money demand!) can create inflation. The fact that this is so common is because it is very desirable in the short-term and does not burn any political capital. 

To combat this, modern central banks are designed to have a reasonable degree of independence from their national governments. A lot of central banks are modelled after the ""Deutsche Bundesbank"", which was infamous for adhering to its strict inflation guidelines despite sometimes enormous political pressure. This helped keep the Deutsche Mark extremely stable throughout its existence.

dogecoin,[Shibe Market Analysis] An Introduction to Fundamentals-based Valuation,"Browsing /r/dogecoin and the community at large, you may have noticed that typically people ""value"", or form an estimate of the prices they'd be willing to buy and sell dogecoin at, through a number of methods, most common of which are a buy and hold-style (which at its core is saying dogecoin will be undervalued til we reach the proverbial moon) and technical analysis based, akin to saying ""dogecoin hasn't gone below 150 in a while, so buying at 150 is probably a good idea"".

While both of these techniques have their merits, there is a 3rd methodology of valuation that may interest the more mathematically-oriented shibes, and is helpful for all shibes to be familiar with, namely fundamentals-based valuation.

**What are fundamentals?**

Fundamentals are the underlying characteristics of the doge economy; metrics like the average transaction value, network difficulty, block reward and rate of dogecoin production are all ways of ""measuring"" these characteristics and play a role in fundamentals-based valuation. It is worth noting that only fundamentals-based valuation can answer the question of ""why"", because it is the only methodology that incorporates the underlying economy beneath the price of doge.  For example, if i ask why dogecoin doesn't go below 150, a trader may answer that whales have a buy wall at 150, or there is strong support at 150, but can never really explain why these phenomenon choose the price of 150 to assert themselves. 

**A Fundamentals-based Valuation**

This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AqvajI8zckPGdHpMZjlZb09vRUpHbV9renF5SEJxdEE&amp;output=html) shows the process of arriving at a target price for DOGE/BTC based on the underlying network difficulty and the cost of building a mining rig.

*Modeling the rig*

Mining rigs are a core component in the production of dogecoin, and while there are vast differences in their appearance and features, all mining rigs can be boiled down into two key metrics - the capital cost per kilohash per second, and the electrical consumption per kilohash per second. Capital cost per KH/s measures how much it costs to build the rig, and typically hovers around $1 per KH/s. Using quality parts and higher margins of safety pushes this value up, while skimping on quality and operating with smaller safety margins can push this value closer to $0.75 or lower. A lower value of capital cost per KH/s means your rig is more efficient with your capital (the money you use to build it). Electrical consumption per KH/s is much more standard, as the predominant AMD gpus essentially share the same chips, and so even though some cards generate higher KH/s, they also use more electricity. This number combined with the electrical cost per kWh in your region essentially determine your ""operating cost"", or the cost you pay to keep your rig running. I've used the typical electicity cost in my region, 15 cents per kWh.


*As a side note, the primary feature of scrypt asics is not the fundamental revolution it was in bitcoins - scrypt asics simply offer much lower electrical consumption per KH/s in exchange for a much higher capital cost per KH/s. It remains to be seen whether the hardware manufacturing industry will reduce the cost of scrypt asics enough to make them competitive with GPUs on a capital cost per KH/s basis. If this happens, then they will indeed become the dominant form of mining hardware, otherwise there will always be room for GPU rigs.*


*Modeling the Macro Economy of Doge*

The network difficulty parameter you've probably heard of before, and essentially controls how many doges you receive per KH/s over a period of time. Since the total number of doges given out per block must average out to a fixed rate, but the global hash rate changes, the network difficulty adjusts to distribute the doges proportionately.

Finally, the Daily Growth Rate is one of the most important parameters, and one of the hardest to estimate. Essentially it's the growth rate of the dogecoin economy, and different ways of estimating it will dramatically change the result. Historically over the last 2 months, the doge economy has grown at an average pace of 5.04% per day, measured by market cap.

*Putting it together*

Using the network difficulty, its possible to estimate the daily doge production per KH/s, which using a network difficulty of 1418 works out to be approximately 7.09 doges/day.  The electricity used to produce this is a flat $0.000000625 worth of kWh per day. The capital cost, on the other hand, varies according to the interest rate you use.  Since we're assuming 1 KH/s costs $1 of capital, the required interest you need to earn on your capital is the effective daily cost of capital.  Summing the two costs gives you an estimated total cost per day in USD of producing the 7.09 doge, and from this we can derive an implied exchange rate.

As you can see, the primary driver of changes in this exchange rate is the interest/growth rate on capital - much like how in fiat markets, the interest rate on government bonds determines exchange rates (if I can earn 2.5% on bonds in India but can borrow at 0.25% in the USA, I will borrow USD to exchange into Indian rupees to buy their bonds and earn a 2.25% spread, and in doing so create demand for rupees and supply of dollars in exchange markets, pushing the value of the rupee up).

In the case of doge, you can think of it as you can borrow on your credit card for 35% annually, or approximately 0.082% daily, and then use the money you get to buy a rig, which earns you 1.65% per day, and pocket the difference of 1.56% (please do not max out your credit card doing this). Should the value of doge fall below the level corresponding to 0.082%, new miners no longer will want to take debt to build mining rigs.  I haven't done the calculations here, but you can actually use litecoin in a similar manner - litecoin is a safer, more established crypto than doge with less price variation, and so at the same rate of return on capital, a miner will probably choose to mine litecoin. Implicitly this also means that mining doge must earn a higher return than mining litecoin, and so the rate of return on capital mining litecoin sets a floor for the rate of return of mining doge, and thus the price of doge. Should the price of doge hit this floor, rather than the price continuing to fall the global hash rate and difficulty would begin going down instead, and those miners continuing to mine doge would receive the required return on capital because they collect more doges per KH/s.


**Takeaways**

Examining the selected interest rates, you can see that at the historical average growth rate of 5.04%, doge should be worth 1024 satoshis, more than 5 times the current price. It's clear the market doesn't believe we will continue growing at 5.04% per day. Working backwards from the current exchange rate, we can actually see that the market currently estimates the doge economy to grow at .86% per day going forward.
When the block reward halves, if the network difficulty doesn't fall substantially, dogecoin will need to become substantially more valuable in order to justify the capital used to mine it. In practice, it will probably be a combination of the network difficulty decreasing and the price of dogecoin increasing that re-equilibriates the 
market, but this process may go on for a few weeks during which time the price of dogecoin and the network difficulty may be highly volatile. Notably, the hash rate that leaves dogecoin will probably migrate to other cryptos, and so it may be worthwhile for daytraders and speculators to begin looking for those alt-coins likely to attract the displaced hashrate from dogecoin once the block reward halves, and buy those coins before their network difficulty rises in anticipation of the prices rising.

While this article isn't meant to be a definitive guide on fundamentals-based valuation, it is meant to introduce the concept and light the path for shibes more interested in investing for the long run and display some of the techniques and the frame of mind behind valuations based on the underlying economy, rather than the lines on a chart.

What should we do?,"My girlfriend and I recently became aware that she had three accounts in collections, two for some forgotton utility bills from the last time she moved and one from unpaid tuition from a ""college"" she attended. 

The two utilities are small enough that I can just pay them off immediately,  but the tuition is about 16k. She also has a 25k federal student loan that is currently in deferrment until june. 

Right now I am the only one of us with a job, and I make $10.87  per hour, but I am starting a new job next monday starting at $12 per hour, but it is twice the driving distance from my current job, meaning more gas consumption. 

She recently had an interview that seemed to go well but we won't find out if she was hired until later this week. The position she interviewed for would pay $10 an hour, but there is a chance that she will get a lower position for $7.75 per hour.

Right now we both live with my parents rent free, but we are planning to move out in a few months into an apartment that will run us about $560 per month, but cut our respective driving distances to work in half. I do realize that the best option would be to stay with my parents, but it is crowded and awkward, and we need our own space.

She recently enrolled in a community college and plans to pursue a degree in kinesiology, and I hear that this should further defer her student loan payments. She apparently also may qualify for a grant that may cover her entire year's tuition.

I was speaking to a friend about our situation and he suggested she file for bankruptcy since she really has no way to pay the debts currently. I don't really want her to do this, especially since she already has a very difficult time finding a job because of her credit, so a better paying one is probably out of the question right now, and bankruptcy will make it even harder for the next ten years.

Right now we don't know what the monthly payment on her debts will be, which prevents us from making an accurate budget for when we move out.

I feel I should also say that not moving out probably isn't an option. She has pretty bad social anxiety and she is terrified of my parents. On most days she can't even bring herself to leave our room without me with her if they are home.

* US Bank savings: 0

My income is approximately $6000/month after all the deductions. For the last several years, my wife and I have operated at a deficit during ""normal"" months while showing a slight ""profit"" during annual bonus or tax refund months.

As you can tell, I have not been managing our money very well. This month I took the advice of a recent posting in /r/personalfinance and started giving my wife cash out of each paycheck and asked her to stop using our credit cards. She took this much better than I anticipated and I'm excited to face our financial future now.

In the past, I've used bonuses and the like to pay down credit cards with the highest interest rates. Last year before my annual bonus, we were paying about $650/month in interest (not counting mortgage interest). I had that down to about $400/month last July but it has risen to $500/month since.

So here's all the questions I can think of:

1. Should I continue to pay down the high APR credit cards? 
1. Should I split the bonus between savings and paying down the worst card? 
1. What about the big windfall? Should I invest it? Use part to pay off the US Bank Visa?
1. Should I build up my checking account balance or keep it minimal as I have thus far?

Thanks in advance for any advice and help you can provide.

Edit: I'm going to use the bonus (which lands on the 15th) to pay off Amazon card split the remainder with savings ($1000) and checking. The tax refund will also go to savings.

The IPO is likely to happen before April. My 50k estimate is extremely conservative and I expect it will be at least double that. I'm still on the fence about cashing in on IPO time or waiting thru the 6 month lock down period. I'll probably do some mix of the two.

Thanks everyone so much for taking time to reply. It is greatly appreciated.",finance,1392026384

dogecoin,Of Wolves And Weasels - Day 34 - Our Crypto-Family,"Hey all! GoodShibe here!

There's a saying out there, some think it's hooey, some live their lives by it...

""We are all connected""

And, yes, we could get into the nature of gluons and talk about 'energy' that can neither be created nor destroyed.  We can get deep and spiritual or straight-up scientific about just how 'connected' we are or aren't out here in the 'real world'.

But that's out there.  

In here, online.  It's actually quite true.  We ARE all connected.  

And cryptocurrencies are a very real representation of that -- in fact, they're entirely built upon THAT promise.

It's *because* we are all connected that they can even hope to work.  That we can bypass the middlemen and communicate and share, directly, with one another.

And that's how our Crypto-Family was born.

Each successful coin taking for itself a fraction of that communication and making a home, a niche, within it.  Whether it being to provide us with an 'internet of money' like Bitcoin, or protect us from internet censorship, like Namecoin, or make our communication more energy and network efficient, like Peercoin - each of these cryptos have been spawned and accepted because they add something to the overall experience.

Litecoin, our father, worked to ensure that the power of the network would remain in the hands of the individual user - that we wouldn't be overtaken by specialized machines.  And it held true, for a very long time. 

With Dogecoin we've found our niche in being the 'friendly' coin.  Of being the 'my first crypto' of digital currencies.  Through tipping and community outreach, we've lowered the entry ramp, made it easier for people who may not be all that technically-minded to come, learn about how cryptocurrency works -- learn how finance and money works -- in a safe and encouraging environment.  Shibes can come, get their hands dirty, play with the coin, without a possibility of losing their shirts (unless they REALLY dive in head-first).

Sure, it may seem like our crypto-family is a bit dysfunctional sometimes.  From those on the outside looking in, it would appear that we're all just a bunch of random coins, thrown together, each trying to grab a slice of Bitcoin's 'riches' for ourselves.  

But those of us on the inside know that it's not that simple.  

We share a common heritage, yes, but we are all, in fact, bound by our common need to *communicate* with one another.  

Some focus on the technical aspects, some focus on the social, some take entirely different approaches... but it's all built toward the same goal.  

That same oh so very Human need.

To reach out.  To meet.  To gather and share.

One of my very proudest moments as a Shibe happened a mere two days ago, as I watched this community rally together to answer a cry for help from our brothers, FedoraCoin.  You can check out that thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xaemj/an_unusual_but_serious_request_for_our_doge/), but, essentially, they had gotten themselves into a bind -- a bind that we, ourselves, could have very well found ourselves in when we were younger.

Basically, the multipools had hopped onto their network and managed to grind their entire network to a halt -- had raised the difficulty so high that it was taking hours to find a single block, and, once the multipool left,  there simply wasn't enough network power to overcome the difficulty left in their wake.  The devs had created a fix and were prepping for a hard fork, but they just needed the network power to get them there.  

It was a horrible situation for anyone to be stuck in -- imagine being stranded in the middle of nowhere, on a hill, when your engine dies.  You've got the parking brake on, and you can feel the whole thing starting to slide backward...

They asked us to hop on and give them a boost, help them make it to the next service station.

There are so many ways that could've gone wrong.  We could've laughed in their face, watched them struggle and fall.  

They're just 'competition', right?

No.  They're *family*.  

And I'm so proud that our shibes jumped right in to help.  Communicating with one another, like brothers, like friends.  Making it right simply because it needed to be made right.

And we *cared* about making it right.

That's how it's supposed to be.  

Sure we have our petty squabbles and our nips and such... all families have that.  But we also have something no one can touch.

A Connection.

And as long as we remember that.  As long as we continue to hold that in our hearts, we're ALL going to the moon.

Together.

personalfinance,Best stategy to pay off debt?,"So I have done a whole lot of looking around online and talking to people about this and the general consensus is that paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first will save the most money in the long run. While I do not agree that it would save the most money over time, what does that do for me in the present? Without going in to too much detail, My current finances are like this:

I have $80 left over after bills on the 1st and I have 120 left over on the 15th. These number do not include Gas or Groceries for my family (me, wife, 2 kids). 

If I use my tax money (~7000) to pay off highest interest rate first, I will be losing a $50/m credit card payment and a $80/m credit card payment. Essentially gaining $130 a month overall to put towards gas and groceries. BUT, if I use the whole return to pay off my car, I will be getting about $320 to put towards the gas, grocery, and bills. 

My concern is that Paying off the highest interest rates first, might save me money in the long run, but isn't going to do much for me now and now is when I need to free up some finances to better support the family. 

What would the best course of action be and why? If you need amplifying info let me know. I will break everything down if required.

Thanks.

*EDIT*
Thanks everyone for the quick responses.  To amplify some information and reiterate some points:
I know the high interest first method will save me money over time.  (It was a typo before) 
I am trying to better my financial situation BY lowering payments
I am trying to free up money by means of paying things off so that I can put that towards other payments and get debt free.  The only caveat to that is that I need some of that money I am currently throwing at my bills to help me in the present time to feed my family.

I just wanted to share a positive TurboTax experience and give kudos to their customer support. I fucked up the other day by choosing the Deluxe Edition online instead of the Basic, let alone the Free. I have a simple tax return, so I definitely don't need any extra features. I only realized what I had done at the checkout when I saw that the total was over $50. 


After this, I went through the customer support chat and asked if there was anything I could do to lower that amount (aside from doing it over again). ""I will make things right, my friend."" he said. Although he was not the quickest, he was very friendly. He gave me a discount code to reduce it to the free amount (free federal, state would have been $15). This should have been a simple fix. However, as I mentioned before, I am a fool and completely missed the area to enter the code, charging my card the full amount.


""Leave your worries behind, I will make things right."" he responded again. After waiting a while longer they just refunded everything entirely due to my inconvenience (even though this was entirely my fault). I didn't get charged anything.

personalfinance,How should our condo factor into my financial planning?,"I'm creating a short and long term budget plan and I'm not sure how to factor in my condo. We bought two years ago at the tail end of the housing slump (in our area). We put 10% down on a place that needed a little work - nothing major. Three months ago we had the place reappraised. The conservative estimate is that our place is worth 20% more than what we bought it for (about $65k more). We're in a well insulated market, paying a low interest rate (no PMI) on a 30 year fixed. 

We put most of our savings into the condo investment. We were lucky enough to buy in the right place at the right time. We did all the work on the house ourselves and stayed within a $2k budget. We have no debt and very secure jobs (late 20s, no kids). When I look at an overview of our finances, I am a little worried about our lack of savings. We don't have a 3-4 month's salary emergency fund.

So here's my question - When I appraise our financial situation, do I essentially ignore the condo? Do we try and build up that emergency fund or can we start putting money in less liquid investments? Should I track the value of our condo, or it irrelevant?",finance,1392048981

Right now our refund started out at $3,500 and for each job I enter (2 part time jobs for her 2 full time for me) the refund went down about ~$200 for each job, and another $500 or so for about $3,300 on W2 from Medicare for our sons regular doctor visits/birth, which no taxes were taken out so I understand that a bit more than the others.

* Just about 26 y/o and make $58,000/year.  Beginning on Friday, I will make $62,000.  I will also receive a bonus of (pre-tax) $5700.  

* I currently have about $13,500 in a BOA savings account I mainly consider an emergency fund, and $5,673.48 in a Roth IRA I opened last year.  I have not put any money into the IRA in 2013.

* I filed my taxes and will be receiving a return of $1797.

* Currently $4012.72 in student loan debt.  The minimum payment per month is $59.44, interest rate is 5.25%.  This is the end of it (woo!) and the only debt I currently have.  Since graduating in May 2010, I have paid down roughly $25,000 in debt (approx. $18k in student loans, $8k car loan).


I am going very (I hope, anyway) conservative and considering my bonus after-tax as $2,050.  Combined with my tax return, that leaves me with $3,882 to spend.  I'm considering one of two options:  Finishing off my student loan or fully funding my IRA for the year.  


If I pay off my debt, I will use my bonus/return and $180.72 from my savings.  To fund the IRA, I'll need the bonus/return and $1,668 from savings.  So what is the best plan of attack here?  My thinking is to fund my IRA fully and begin to aggressively pay down the debt and rebuild my savings considering I will be receiving a raise (an extra $300/month I can use).  My debt now is very manageable and I feel the net benefit of funding the IRA fully outweighs getting rid of the last few thousand of debt.  On the other hand, it would be very nice to be debt free and I could partially fund my IRA for the year using some of my savings, likely $2-3,000 (which I'm leaning against).

If I pay off the credit card debt it will make my finances easier to manage by not having so many debt accounts. 

Help me out please. 

By the way I don't make that much money. I make $30,000 a year.",finance,1392063850
investing,Carry trade with options hedging,"Dear Reddit, maybe this is too technical, but recently I found an interesting investing strategy. You buy a currency pair where there is a difference in interest rates and receive a carry just for holding the position. For example, AUD/JPY pays 0.5pip per day just for holding the position. 

The problem is that if the JPY strengthens (like it happened in '08), you can lose all your money.

So I am looking for an option or a future to hedge that. Does anyone know what the best way is? I looked at the futures /6jh4 but they seem too expensive…

personalfinance,Woops! I didn't realize my student loan was in default. What should I do?,"This is 100% my fault. I've been paying on my student loans for a few years but I had no idea that my monthly payment didn't include a Perkins loan I had taken out. I've moved several times since college and somehow in all of it, I've been getting mail about my FedLoans but not the Perkins... I have no idea how that happened...

Anyways, I applied to grad school and found out my undergrad school won't release my transcripts because there is a hold on my account (hence how I found out about this in the first place). The principle is really small - just over $1,300. With interest it's just over $1,600 - yeah... it's about 30 months past due o_O

They've given me three options: 1) consolidate my loans so that my monthly payments will include the amount from the Perkins loan, 2) pay a ""rehabilitation"" over 9 months (around $183 per month), or 3) pay it off in full. I called today to pay it off in full because I would rather just get rid of it now and pay less interest overall. Well, when I called today the woman stated that because I'm paying it off in full and not doing the 9 month rehabilitation, it will still show as a negative on my credit report. Whereas if I went through the 9 month rehabilitation, they would reverse the negative report and it would basically look like I had paid it according to the original terms and conditions.

That just sounds ridiculous but then again it is the government... Is this actually correct? Am I better off to just go through the 9 month rehabilitation and pay more interest in exchange for removal of the negative report on my credit? Does it really impact my credit score that much? I'm at a complete loss for what to do now...

Read the Full Post at: http://alunacrypto.blogspot.nl/2014/02/how-to-pick-trade-next-profitable-altcoin-bitcoin-daytrading.html. And follow me for my latest Bitcoin/Altcoin trading advice on Twitter @onemanatatime (https://twitter.com/onemanatatime).

**Introduction**

Congratulations on owning some Bitcoins and being a part of this Global Revolution! If you don't already own one, buy one easily from an exchange like Bitstamp.net, Coinbase.com, or from someone near you at Localbitcoins.com. Once you own Bitcoins, you can easily trade them for any available Alternative Cryptocurrency from an altcoin exchange like Cryptsy. I like to use Cryptsy because they have so many available coins, and I also find them to be quite reliable.

So you've been seeing tons of people making money trading Altcoins, while you've been losing tons of Bitcoins buying high and selling low? Whether you're simply frustrated with your ""bad luck"", or just want to learn more &amp; make more Bitcoins daytrading, I'm here to help! So here's an easy-to-understand guide to picking and trading Bitcoin and Altcoins profitably, and of course, more essential daytrading tips to help us all become profitable cryptocurrency traders.

I know you're all eager to make money, but keep in mind that nothing comes for free and I can only help you so much. Just because you've made 5 good trades doesn't make you a profitable trader, and neither does making 5 bad trades necessarily mean you're a lousy trader. Anyone can flip a coin and see 'heads' 5 times in a row. What we want to look for is consistency, and to do that you'll have to start forming Your Own trading strategy. Before I go on, keep these following points in mind when building up your personal Trading Strategy:

* Learn the basics; read my last few blog posts, and also other trading resources to learn more about Technical Analysis and other trading tips. ""I don't think that you can write music if you don't know how to play an instrument. You have to know the basics, then you can go forward."" ~Alber Elbaz

* Discipline is key; be patient and build up a fundamental understanding of the markets, and more importantly, hone that keen trading sense of yours. We all have it in us, just takes a little discipline and practice.

* Markets are ever-evolving; don't treat it like its static because past actions are not an indication of future performance. Always be open to and learn from other's opinions, be objective about it, and constantly adapt and improve your strategy.

* Lazy = poor; Nobody can help you but yourself, don't expect to be spoon-fed. Be an active learner and constantly seek new ways to improve your strategy. Reflect on what went wrong and don't make the same mistakes again. When in doubt, ask Google.

* There's only so much you can learn from reading; you don't learn how to ride a bicycle by reading a book, go out there and put your knowledge into practice. Start small to test your strategy and build your confidence.

**How to Find new Altcoins?**

So the first thing is to actually find new altcoins and to read up more about what it has to offer. To begin with, I always browse through the Alternative Currency announcements page on Bitcointalk to see what's popular. All new coins are definitely posted here so you shouldn't miss anything, and since threads with the newest post always appear on top, you usually don't have to look further than 2 pages. Things to look out for include the added value a coin brings (as I'll explain more in the next section), as well as the popularity and virality of the altcoin (i.e. high number of pages in a short time).

Another place to look at is Cryptocointalk where you can find a long list of altcoins available, sorted according to new coins or by algorithm. This list is not completely updated, but is organized much better if you want to find out more about a particular coin.

Secondly, you also want to cross-check your information about these coins on social media sources such as Reddit and Twitter. Start off on...

&gt; Other topics covered in this post include:

**What to Look Out For?**

With so many alternatives out there, we really need to be picky when choosing the next altcoin because you don't want to spread yourself too thinly. Firstly, clones of existing ideas/coins are mostly not worth holding for anything more than the short-term. In this sense, there's a few different kinds of coins with their respective leaders in each category, each with their own pros &amp; cons:...

**Where to Buy?**

**When/What's a Good Price to Buy/Sell?**

For new altcoins, and especially clones, all you'll need is to find a good price to buy, since there's no charts for you to do any TA yet. I found a pretty useful formula for calculating a fair price, and have found it to be pretty accurate. Use it, let me know what you think about it, and how we can improve it to apply to different coin types etc. by Tweeting me or leaving a comment below.

Here's the Secret Formula to calculate a Fair Price for new altcoins: (Maximum BTC Supply ÷ Maximum Altcoin Supply) ÷ 5000to10000. #crystalball


**How to Trade?**

Obviously, the most important rule in trading is to ""buy low sell high"". Unfortunately, that's usually harder to execute than it sounds because of panic and greed. Haven't you learn enough from bubbles? Whatever goes up must come down. Markets will always look for a correction after a big spike. Don't chase the bubble! EVERY parabolic curve/rise is a bubble, and a chance for you to sell your altcoins for a profit. Just wait for it and always set sell positions ready to eat up those buys.

**Trading Tips**

**#0: Don't join Pump &amp; Dumps, period.** For someone to make money, someone else has to lose. Don't be the one caught with the short end of the stick.

**#1: Always trade with a plan.** Before entering a trade, plan not only your entry but also your exit. Don't fall into the trap of panic buying/selling. Once you get over that, everything will start to come together.

**#2: Discipline.** Be patient and wait for good setups. Plenty of opportunity everyday, don't spread too thin. On a side note, I can't wait for a margin platform for altcoins to be built. If you're building one, hit me up and let see how we can work together (I'm a Business Development and Online Marketing Major).

**#3: Money management.** Don't spend more than 5-10% of your entire BTC portfolio on a single Altcoin, unless you're damn sure it's gonna be profitable in the mid-long term.

**#4: Understand human psychology.** Here's a good 5 part series to get you started: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEcZQdCEiKE

**Most Common Pitfalls**

1) *Placing too much importance on:*

* Buy/Sell Walls. I barely look at buy/sell walls because these can be manipulated so easily especially for lower volume altcoins. I only use this, if ever, to have a better idea of support/resistance levels, although I know many people will tell me these work wonders and I trust you too.

* Market Capitalization. Market caps are nothing more than two numbers multiplied by each other; total supply and price. It gives you a good judgement of how a crypto is currently doing, but in no way does it say if an altcoin is a good buy/sell now. I think what's more important when looking for long-term buys is the total hashrate (and rate of growth) of the cryptocurrency. 

* News Stories. More often than not, news is already factored into price by the time you read about it. Of course, exceptions include ""big"" pieces of news such as China's government intervention, recent Russia's ban, and issues with (then) leading exchanges.

2) *Overtrading.* I'll let the guy whom I learnt all my Bitcoin trading fundamentals from speak about this: Bitcoin Trading Webinar - How To Make Money Trading Bitcoin (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ-xROFn0zg). Follow him on Twitter @ChrisDunnTV (https://twitter.com/ChrisDunnTV). Long video, but worth it especially for beginners.

3) *Not having a plan beforehand.* I can't emphasize this enough. Many people jump into buying an altcoin without thinking about their exit plan. What is your target, when you do sell and take profit, when do you sell and cut losses, or do you have more funds/positions ready to buy more if it continues to dip? Are you holding this for the short term or long term? These are all important questions to ask yourself before making a trade. If you don't have a sound and comfortable strategy before entering trades, more likely than not, you're going to end up losing Bitcoins over the (not so) long run.

4) *Trying to predict a bottom/top.* Nobody can predict exactly where the price is going next, only a better and more informed guess. I personally think this is the toughest problem to tackle, because when greed takes over, you always think ""I could have made so much more if only I sold higher or bought lower"".

5) *Chasing the bubble.* What goes up must come down. https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/statuses/432546827196305408

6) *Getting emotionally attached to a particular altcoin.* I have to admit this is still a problem for me, and I'm still holding onto bags of WDC, ZET, EAC, MSC, that are currently unprofitable. I bought them earlier on, and didn't take profits from the bubbles. But most important thing is that we learn from our mistakes, and that's why I now like to sell some positions to get into a position to ""freeroll"".

7) *Using Technical Analysis as the sole determinant for making trades.* Every indicator is useless - by itself. The market is not stagnant, and prices are affected by everything we can, and cannot think of. Don't be bound by one system of analysis; use every single piece of information you can find, and objectively analyze the markets with a bird's eye view.

**My Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy**

Firstly, I must emphasize that I'm VERY Bullish on Bitcoin for the Long Term. I've invested every single FIAT dollar I have into Cryptocurrencies since November 2013, and I literally have to start selling Bitcoins 2 months later to pay my rent (or wait for a Bitcoin ATM to appear here). Because of this, I spend a ton of time &amp; effort researching Bitcoin and Altcoins to constantly look for ways to grow my number of Bitcoins. I also have a high risk propensity and so not all my trades will be comfortable for you. My point basically is that nobody's situation is exactly the same, so keep in mind that you'll have to build your own strategy to suit your personal needs, risk preference, available resources, and environment...

**My Current Altcoin Watchlist**

Long Term: 

* Ethereum

* Reggie Middleton's UltraCoin layer

Mid Term:

* VertCoin

* UltraCoin
* MintCoin

Others (Not so impressive but still watching):

* MaxCoin. Way overpriced. Could probably fall 10x-100x. Wait and see where the bottom is.

* KarmaCoin. Decently priced. I think 1 to 2 Satoshi is definitely a steal. Provided this coin can gain enough traction for a bubble. 

Cryptocoinchart.info recently launched a new Social Trading feature; Investment Club. Pretty cool. Check it out: http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/v2/investment_club. Don't forget to stop by periodically and bookmark my Cryptocoinchart Investment Club profile (http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/v2/investment_club/trader/12) for updates on which coins I'm eyeing/buying.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

*1. How do you feel about XYZ coin?*

First of all, there are over 100 altcoins out there, so don't expect me to know about every coin. If it's an exactly clone of Bitcoin, Litecoin, or anything already available, chances are, it's not worth either of our time.

Secondly, read my tweets and do your own research (lazy = poor). If its worth mentioning, I probably did mention it. If you can't find it on my timeline because its too cluttered, again, do a Twitter search for the Altcoin and find out what the World has to say about it.

Thirdly, there's 100s of altcoins out there for you to choose from. Don't spread yourself too thin and buy into every possible bottom. Leave the shitcoins to die, and stick to altcoins with a stronger fundamentals.

*2. If I'm holding a bag of XYZ coin, should I just wait or sell for a loss now?*

Rule #1 of the game: Buy Low Sell High. But obviously easier said than done.

If you think the coin isn't going make it to the mid-term, and want to liquidate them, you have two options. Sell now and take the loss; that's the hardest thing to do, but also what every good traders knows he needs to do. Or if you think the coin has potential, buy more at where you think is a low, so your average buy price drops, and you can liquidate some/all as soon as it bounces back up. Think Martingale (doubling) strategy.

Bitcoin,Layman explanation of the Bitcoin Bug that helped MtGox be hacked,"The bug which helped hackers steal from MtGox is an ""accounting"" bug and *not a breach of the Bitcoin encryption and core security.*

**What hackers didn't do:**


Hackers never altered a transaction enough to cause Bitcoins to be double spent, or cause Bitcoins to go to other than the intended recipient.

What hackers DID accomplish was change the ""transaction ID"" which you can think of as a Fedex tracking number. The package was still delivered to the correct house, but if you checked the website you'd think it was in Malaysia. 

So how did hackers steal money from MtGox if they never broke Bitcoin's core security?

Because MtGox has written their own custom ""Wallet"" software - and due to the high volume and rapid frequency of trading, they put themselves into a position to be hacked.

**The actual Hack:**


When Bitcoins are transmitted, there is a delay while miners on the internet validate the blockchain.  The blockchain is the entire ledger of the history of all Bitcoins and everyone on the internet has the same access to it. Bitcoin wallet software downloads the chain to keep track of how much money it has. Miners download the chain to try and be the first one to mathematically prove the transactions are valid. Investors and Speculators download the chain to look at how [Bitcoins are moving around and in what volumes.]( http://fiatleak.com )



During this time, the transactions are available to view by manually viewing the blockchain. You can see the entire history of validation transactions, or you can find your transaction to see if it's been validated yet. This is what your wallet does for you.

see here to look at the [blockchain : blockchain.info]( https://blockchain.info/)


Due to the high volume of trades, it became a common problem for transactions not to get into the blockchain. These transactions would need to be re-transmitted in this situation.


This is normal for high frequency transactions through low bandwidth or high latency systems. The server handling all the transactions could have issues or the network handling the traffic could be too slow. But Bitcoin is resilient, and normally the transaction would be re-sent until it was accepted into the blockchain, the only harm being a delay.


**The Hackers actually tricked MtGox:**

The hackers were customers of MtGox. They would transfer Bitcoins to themselves, then exploit the transaction ID bug to change the transaction ID. They still got the Bitcoins, but with a different tracking #.

So the hackers claim their transaction was never sent; and MtGox' own buggy software ""verifies"" that the transaction is not in the blockchain so it sends more coins to the hacker.

No Bitcoins were ever ""double spent"" - MtGox was tricked into sending *two payments* to hackers who were their own customers.


I hope this made it easier to understand this problem. I am a big fan of cryptocurrency and I think it is important for our future.",cryptocurrency,1392075361
personalfinance,What am I doing wrong?,"Ok folks, so here's the deal and I've been debating whether to submit a post or not. I'm 28, in a stable teaching job and just about to finish my Masters degree. Plain and simple I've been an idiot with money, not saving enough, or hardly at all, using credit cards freely, etc. 

I hate living paycheck to paycheck and need to find a way to get out of this silly debt, start saving more, and not worry if I am going to overdraw my bank account.

Details:

Credit Cards
8 cards with just under $9K balance. Paying about $355 a month in total. 

Undergraduate and Graduate Loans
1 Undergraduate (consolidated after graduation) about $13K left to pay at 5.25%, paying $193 a month.
2 Private Graduate Loans: $3K balance, 2.5%, paying $90 a month.
1 Federal Consolidated Graduate Loan: about to enter repayment at 6.25%, payments will be $250 a month.

Personal Loan
1, $400 left to pay, paying $120 a month.

Monthly Expenses
Cell Phone: $90
Car Insurance: $295 
Rent $400
Savings: $200 ($50 a week)
Groceries: $200
Gas: $80

I bring in about $2.8K a month (net), and figure I'm paying $1.5K before rent, gas, groceries, and savings. Figuring in all that I've got $800 a month left. 

My payments are spread all over the month and the most frustrating is the small amounts of credit card payments. I've checked out YNAB and a few other resources, but I can't get used to using YNAB. I've thought about the Snowball method. 

Here's my question: I was considering consolidating all of my credit cards into one lump sum payment by taking out a Personal Loan (the Credit Union I am with will most likely approve my loan, and I could hold my car (mine, all paid for) as collateral. I figured if I take out a $9K loan at 4 years with 12% rate, I would lower my Credit Card payments by $100 and could apply that to Student Loans. Is this a foolish thing to attempt? How can I better control my spending and ensure I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, because honestly it's too much stress for me and it's not allowing me to move forward with goals of establishing my savings and getting a place of my own.

personalfinance,Help with buying a car!,"I took a look at an $8000 '08 Chevy Malibu 2LT (102k miles) this weekend, and I decided that out of all the cars I've looked at, I really want this one. 

Originally I had planned to trade in my '01 Ford Taurus ($500) and put $1300 cash down. The dealer came back with a monthly payment of ~$320/month for 48 months. This seemed odd to me, simply because the interest rate -- I believe -- would have been something like 50%+. I told him that the most I could do was $150, and he said he could get it down to $210 if I could put $2000 down.

Now after selling the Taurus myself, I'm going back tomorrow to offer $3300 cash down and see if I can't get 10% for 48 months or 12% for 60 months. I was a little thrown off by his first offer, but I still want the car.

I make about $850/month before taxes, and my credit is just around average. I understand that I don't make a lot of money, but I make enough to afford $100-$150/month plus insurance.

Any advice for me? What are some things I should ask about or take note of before signing anything? 

Edit: I've already contacted my credit union, and they're saying I need a co-signer. The issue is that no one in my immediately family would qualify. I don't mind financing.

Bitcoin,Mt.Gox is insolvent. Warnings were evident for months. Civil and possible Criminal Proceedings will follow.,"One of the negative aspects of the so called Bitcoin community is the absence of simple reason and logic. Many members are fueled by passions and emotions. **This explains the total blindness to what is going on around them.**

Mt.Gox became insolvent sometime during the early summer of 2013. How do we know this? The price began disconnecting itself from other markets, and as a result all of a sudden fiat withdrawals began grounding to a halt. From week delays to months to half a year.

Facts Started in 2013:

* Mt.Gox refused to inform new and present users of the seized funds by the government of the United States until it was public knowledge. 5 million seized.

* Mt.Gox deliberately lied on US government applications about the nature of it's business.

* Mt.Gox led deliberate distraction campaigns by claiming to be implementing litecoin. Giving specific by the end of the month time frames. This never occured. This was mainly done as a campaign to distract from  internal financial stress.

* Mt.Gox ""partner"" CoinLab stiffed the company for 5 million dollars. **Mt.Gox in court documents admitted to crediting accounts for funds which were never delivered.** We discover this MONTHS after the fact.

* Total liquidity damage to Mt.Gox may have been at minimum 10 million. This is the exact time that withdrawal problems began occurring. These events are RELATED.

* Mt.Gox released statements claiming the ""fiat"" system cannot handle the volume of wires because it is technically inferior to BTC. The ""fiat"" system wires hundreds of billions daily globally just fine.

* Roger Ver vouches for Mt.Gox credibility. Roger Ver himself a convicted felon has previously had ethical concerns raised with blockchain.info as documented on the forums.  

* Mt.Gox continues pretending everything is alright and accepting deposits from new users unaware of what was occurring behind the scenes. 

* Fall 2013 users begin reporting issues with BTC withdrawals. Delays begin increasing.

* January 2013 Odd price discrepancies begin showing up as the Mt.Gox vs Bitstamp/btce spread widens rapidly. API pulls from Mt.Gox show withdrawals beginning to increase. Mt. Gox disables the data stream.

* Mt.Gox begins a strange re-verification process of users who previously used bit instant. Knowing very well this can encompass a huge amount of early individuals. Possible stall tactic?

* Feb 2013. Mt. Gox halts user withdrawals entirely.

* Mt. Gox in an act of desperation blames withdrawals on a none-issue error from 3 years ago. Rumors fly that Mt. Gox was being scammed. No evidence of the double withdrawals are presented by Mt.Gox via blockchain links.

* Despite a broken exchange. **MT.GOX IS STILL ACCEPTING DEPOSITS.**

Mt. Gox has not presented any evidence to backup any of its claims or excuses to date.

The market was pricing a 25% chance of Mt. Gox insolvency in Fall of 2013 briefly and again in January 2013. 

**Many prominent members of the Bitcoin community who will not be named have been actively supporting and steering individuals to Mt. Gox fully aware of potentially dubious activities by Mark Karpeles during 2013**

**The Bitcoin Foundation once again has board members who have a conflict of interest**. Mark Karpeles who provided 10,000 BTC to finance the Foundation and Chairman Peter Vessenes were involved in lawsuits.

Gavin Andressen derives a salary from the foundation. Possible conflict here? Karpeles one of largest providers of funds.

Unanswered questions remain.

Mt. Gox problems started almost 8 months ago. Why did the foundation not ask both Vessenes and Karpeles to excuse themselves while they engage in their dispute? **Why did the foundation completely ignore the unfolding financial disparity at Mt. Gox?**

**Mark Karpeles along with a host of known individuals have turned a communication issue into potential criminal fraud and embezzlement. This may include other individuals.**

personalfinance,"Hey R/PF, I am looking to get into a better financial position, but honestly I am a bit overwhelmed with all the information here.","Hey r/PF! 

I have spent some time the last few days reading through info here and on the FAQ. To be honest, I am completely overwhelmed with all the info. I was hoping maybe you guys could send a bit of advice my way.

Since it seems like pertinent information:
I am 23, Wife is 22. She will be graduating at the end of the year from school and will be working a job making a minimum of 32,xxx a year. I currently make 44,xxx a year and am the only income earner. We estimate between the two of us we will have a total of 39k in student debt when she graduates. Both of our cars are paid off and I have started a small IRA and 401K. We are hoping to work on paying down some of our student debt and work on saving for a house. We also currently have about 6-7 months of full expenses saved up as an emergency fund (around 5k). With higher mileage cars I feel like this is a fairly good amount of money to hold onto.

There is one student loan for under 4k that has a really high interest rate of 10.5%. The rest of the loans are much better at 3.5% - 6.8%. I plan to put as much as possible towards the high interest loan to get rid of it ASAP.

Should I be taking some of our emergency fund and putting it somewhere else? It seems like mutual funds and bonds don’t offer much over an online savings account. I am nervous about transferring my money to someplace online where I don’t have direct contact with the people holding my money.

We are also interested in saving for a house. We currently rent a house for $750 a month and we could purchase a house for 100-110k and still be paying far less in mortgage fees, even with PMI than we are for rent. I understand we would be responsible for home repairs, but I feel with a proper emergency fund and a fund set aside for home repairs that it would be doable. Especially once my wife has officially started her career. We also happen to own 2 dogs that we absolutely adore and unfortunately this makes renting very difficult. If for any reason we had to leave our rental (location, tornado, flood) we would have a VERY difficult time finding another place to rent. Let alone for a reasonable rate.

Does R/PF have any advice to help us straighten out our finances? I appreciate all the help and info!",finance,1392114532

dogecoin,Operation Doge Day (an idea for the foundation),"I would like to propose that for the next funding project the Dogecoin Foundation chooses to focus on be a PR campaign. While, I truly believe in the charitable projects the foundation has chosen to support I think the community would benefit from efforts made to directly engage people and expose them to Doge coin. While charities certainly do help promote the coin and help others, they don't do very much in terms of educating people about crypto currency.

I think it would be smart of the foundation to pick a day in the next few months and have volunteers in several cities or universities around the globe reach out to the public to promote the coin. They could do this by setting up stands with promotional materials and swag to grab peoples attention.

To promote the coin these stands could give away

*T-shirts

*Stickers

*Paper wallets with a small amount of Doge

These stands would have to be staffed by volunteers who could answer questions about Doge coin and also hand out brochures, talk about Doges charitable endeavors, and maybe even explain tipbots. I think giving college students paper wallets and teaching them how to tip on facebook or twitter would drum up a ton of interest in the coin.

Hopefully, by doing something like this we'd engage a group of people who wouldn't normally find out about the coin.",cryptocurrency,1392127562

I have a couple of questions regarding filing taxes and what to do with a 1099.

I got so excited about finally receiving my W-2 and health insurance information early that I went ahead and filed my federal and state returns on February 7.  Because I am enrolled in a Master's program and am eligible for one of the educational credits, I am scheduled to receive a fairly large federal refund.

Unfortunately, the day after I submitted my tax return, I received a notice from my investment bank that I have a 1099 that will be sent out sometime in mid-February.  I took a distribution of around $12,000 from my individual account last January to help pay for some of my school expenses, so I am expecting to have some capital gains to report.

**My question is: what do I do about my tax return and the big refund that is coming?**  I know that I will need to to file an amended federal return.  Do I also need to file an amended state return (I live in Massachusetts)?  What happens if my refund is affected by the information on my 1099?

I am sorry if these are silly questions.  I've never ""cashed out"" on investments before and have never had to file an amended return.

dogecoin,How to get better at trading - FOREX,"Hey everyone. One thing that seems to keep coming up is the idea of making cash via trading. I am totally down with that. What is not cool, though, is people doing it without being informed.
For instance, can you read a candlestick chart? Do you have a plan to minimize risk? These are some pretty basic things.

The best way to learn them is through looking up online courses and tutorials about foreign exchange trading (FOREX). Basically, forex was traditionally trading dollars for euros, or dollars for yen, and vice versa. Then you'd take advantage and trade back to make money. Sound familiar? It's the exact same thing as trading cryptos, except the tools are a little more rudimentary (they don't have to be, but people haven't built something like metatrader for cryptos yet). Plus, unlike trading traditional fiat currencies, you can actually mine cryptos.

**Here are some small things that are helpful to know:**

* When you make a trade, define a point you want to exit, and commit to that.
* Try to never commit more than 2% of your total resources to a particular trade. It sucks to lose 2% on a trade, it sucks way more to lose 100%.
* Never trade on news. Seriously. The whole halvening thing? That's news. Stay away from it like it's the plague. Wait for the market to settle back down or you could see yourself getting nasty burnt. Don't believe me? Look at what happens to the candlestick charts of currency pairs like the Eurodollar whenever the Fed gives a statement. Trading on news can be profitable, but most of the time, it will leave you cold and broke.
* Keep your emotions in check. Always. They will lie to you. Do your best to use cold logic and numbers.
* If the crypto markets ever evolve to the point where you can use stop losses, USE THEM.
* Hedge your bets. Keep a variety of things in reserve. A mix of long term investment plus some trading is usually more successful than just exclusively trading.

**Another thing to keep in mind**, both IOS and android have free FOREX trading games you can download which use actual historical numbers between currency pairs. You can play with them and start to understand patterns of the market and improve your trading before you ever move a doge out of your wallet. It's invaluable practice.

This is my first time doing my taxes, and despite completing both the free online Turbotax and H&amp;R Block software I am still really confused. Here is my basic situation: I lived in DC for 5 months while completing my senior year of college, then I moved to Virginia in May and currently live there. From January to May, I worked as a student employee for my university. In June, I became a full-time staff member in a different department for my university. Thus, I received only one W-2 form despite having three jobs in total for the year. My income for the year was $22,776.

My father also might try to claim me as a dependent despite not paying for anything, and we do not have a relationship. He has done this in the past, and I tried contacting him to tell him not to claim me but I haven't been able to reach him. I have been told that this could hold up my refund or cause other issues. 

Currently, I am being told I owe over $700 to DC, and will receive a federal return of over $2000 and a VA refund of $200 via Turbotax. Does this sound accurate for what I make? Should I seek out the advice of a professional to do my taxes for this year? Is $700 a lot to owe for DC tax?

personalfinance,Student Loans vs. 401k Contribution vs. Roth IRA,"Hi All.

A bit about myself: I'm 28, unmarried, and starting my career after a decade of higher education.  I put together a brief monthly budget and am interested in the most effective way to get rid of my loans and begin saving.

**Income and 401k (monthly):**

* + $8333 Gross Income
* - $150 Health Insurance
* - $833 10% 401k Contribution (Employer matches 2/3 up to 6%)
* = $7350 Taxable Income
* - $2430 Fed, State, Social Security, and Medicare deductions
* = $4920 Take home each month


**Expenses (monthly):**

* -$1000 for Rent and Utilities (shared house)
* -$300 for Groceries
* -$120 for Car Insurance
* -$110 for Fuel
* -$70 for Cell Phone
* -$500 for Travel (girlfriend lives out of town, this is for a monthly visit.)
* -$250 for Misc (vehicle maintenance, etc.)
* = -$2350 of essential monthly expenses.

This leaves me with about $2570 monthly or $30840 yearly for savings and spending money.


**Other Assets and Debt:**

* + $5000 in Savings
* + $1500 in Checking (average)
* - $0 Credit Card (paid monthly)
* + $4000 in Roth IRA that is losing money monthly (I haven’t contributed to it in 5 years).
* - $3250 Unsubsidized student loan @ 1.75% interest
* - $17320 Subsidized student loan @ 6.8% (I have 6 months before interest starts)

So $20570 total in student loans. No car payment and vehicle is relatively new, I stay up to date on proper maintenance and do the work myself.


**Financial Goals:**

* Wipe out student loans ASAP
* Save $50k for a down payment on a house
* Be smart about retirement contributions


**Questions:**

* Is it dumb to be putting 10% into 401k when employer match is only 2/3 up to 6% and I have student loans that will begin accruing interest in 6 months? I’m not sure how a 401k gains value or at what rate.
* I plan on liquidating the Roth IRA immediately and putting it towards the $3250 unsubsidized loan accumulating interest now.  Is this a smart move?
* I believe I can knock out the student loans with help from the Roth IRA before they begin accumulating interest in about 6 months.  This would mean no savings (red flag!).  How much of the take home after expenses should be going into emergency savings monthly? 10%, 25%, 50%?


Thanks in advance for your advice.  I’m mostly interested in the explanation behind why I should or shouldn’t do something.",finance,1392155580

What it’s typically not about: credit cards, credit scores and anything as crass as cash.

Except lately. Whether it’s because recession-rattled consumers are still focused on their bottom lines or whether personal finance experts are trying to capitalize on Valentine-y sentiments, there’s been lots of attention recently on romance and money.

[“Love and money cannot be separated,”](http://deepbluegroup.org) said Gail Cunningham, spokeswoman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling in Washington, D.C . Because money is “intertwined with just about everything we do, it can impact a relationship – even before it gets off the ground.”

With Feb. 14 just days away, we thought it’d be romantically responsible to share a few gems:

[Money heart-to-hearts](http://deepbluegroup.org/blog/)

Too many couples never talk seriously about their finances. Financial experts say that’s a major mistake, whether it’s a new romance or a years-long marriage.

“It really is an act of love to share your finances with your significant other,” said NFCC’s Cunningham. “The more you’re on the same page (financially), the less trouble you’ll have down the road.”

Without a clear financial picture, the first time you go together to rent an apartment, buy a car or take out a home loan, it could be potentially embarrassing – and costly. If one partner has an iffy credit history, it likely will mean much higher interest rates or even having a loan denied.

Schedule a time for a serious talk in a casual setting, suggests Cunningham.

For new couples, it could be looking together at income (yes, bring out the pay stubs, she says), existing debt (credit cards, car loans, etc.), investments and even credit reports. Being honest about your financial past and current situation can put a relationship on a healthy financial footing.

For established couples, it might be having a talk about retirement readiness, how to share financial tasks more equally, understanding the family investments or checking beneficiaries on life insurance and bank accounts. Or review your goals for some of life’s big-ticket items, like a new house, kids’ college or special vacation.

I've got significant student loan debt, which I'm making payments on. No problem there.

Other than these loans, I've got a Macy's card I buy undies with every few months.  I did make a late payment on this card about a year and a half ago.

personalfinance,"25 years old, looking for advice on the best ways to save/invest.","Hi, PF! I just stumbled across this sub this morning and have been scouring the posts all day, there is some excellent information here! Anyways, I'm 25 years old and have just recently (within the past two years) begun to repair the damage caused to my finances by my lovely 18-19 year old self. I'm mainly seeking the best route for me to take now in regards to my overall finances (more details below), savings and investments. 

I have stable employment and currently take home about $2200 per month and my expenses (rent, car payment, utilities etc) run about $1200 per month. I have a 401k with Vanguard and contribute 5%, my employer contributes 10% of my salary through yearly profit sharing. Currently, I have a bit less than $3k in the account since I have only been at my job for about a year and a half. I have $1k in a savings account that isn't touched for the most part.

I did not go to college, so no student loans. That might be one of the only good things I've got going for me here. 

Right now, I have about $3000 on a CC with no interest. The balance will be paid with my tax refund and some money that I've been saving to pay it off in full by the end of this month. I have another no interest CC with a $600 balance that I plan to knock out within the next three months. I've recently received my credit report and although my score is decent (720) and has no outstanding or unpaid issues, I have multiple hard inquiries within the past two years that are definitely hurting me. 

I have an auto loan with a $17k balance and my vehicle is worth about $12k at this time. My loan won't be paid off until 2018, and I pay $390 per month. The payment isn't hurting me, I have no trouble making it but I do have trouble with the interest rate being at about 10%. The fact that my car is upside-down has made it difficult to have it re-financed and I'm scared to shop around and have even more hard hits affecting my credit.

I suppose what I'm really looking for today is advice on where to go or what to do next. There's no one in my family that I'll ever get a check, property or inheritance from and many of the people around me are blessed with that luxury; it's hard to see their advice as anything more than a conversation. Once I have these credit cards out of the way, what (if anything) can I do to remedy the situation with my auto loan? How can I effectively build myself a solid financial future, emergency fund and overall security and is that even possible with my income on my own? I don't ever want to have to rely on family to take care of me, or end up unable to feed or house myself in retirement. I understand that I may never be able to afford to buy a home in the area I live, but if there is a way to set myself up correctly if the opportunity were to arise I'd like to at least try.

I tried to log into my Cryptsy account, and was met by ""User could not be found."" I automatically assumed that I was just making a typo and went back and tried again, double checked everything, and still...nothing. So I tried a different username, assuming that perhaps I had finally lost my mind and my username was something different all along - still ""User not found"". So, I attempted to recover my password...""User not found"". I thought that was odd, and perhaps a server error, so I asked around. No one else had any issues, so I decided to open a ticket. I opened a ticket and waited a few days, still no response. I went to go check on it through the e-mail I had received, when I was met with ""This ticket does not exist"". I thought that was odd, and tried multiple things to find the ticket - it was gone. I thought perhaps my best bet is to assume it was another server error, and open another ticket. So I did, and even at this point, still no reply in days. Other tickets that were in line much after mine are being taken care of. I understand there are some that are easier than others, but I cannot ignore what has happened any longer. I had thousands...&gt;5000$ (no comment on actual amount) in DOGE and BTC on the account. I would like to recover it, but I am at a loss.

Perhaps someone on reddit can help. I don't expect anything extraordinary. I've attempted a tweet as well, no response. **I am not looking for hand outs, I just would like to get my account back.** 

I have tried other subreddits, did not have any response. I am putting this here because the dogecoin community is most active, and the majority of my holdings are dogecoin.

***P.S. 2FA was setup.***

1. You let your political views guide your investments without realizing that the market doesn't care who you voted for or which cable news outlet you find more honest.

2. Your definition of ""long term"" is the time between now and the next bear market, whenever that is.

3. You suffer from the Dunnig-Kruger effect, lacking enough basic financial knowledge to even realize that you're making mistakes. People's lack of understanding about things like compound interest and inflation can lead them to believe they're making good financial decisions when in reality they're tripping over themselves with failure.

4. For every $1 raise you receive, your desires rise by $2 or more.

5. You spend lots of money on material stuff to impress other people without realizing those other people couldn't care less about you. You'd be shocked at how few people care where your purse was made or how much noise your car makes.

6. You are unshakably certain about things you know very little about, particularly regarding monetary policy.

7. You have never been able to predict what the market will do next. This doesn't deter you from trying to predict what the market will do next.

8. You don't learn vicariously from other people's financial problems. By the time you get the hang of making smart money decisions, your life expectancy rounds to zero.

9. You think you're young, invincible, and don't need health insurance. Then icy sidewalks, moving cars, and rapidly dividing cells prove you wrong.

10. You get upset when you hear on TV that the government is running a deficit. It doesn't bother you that you heard this on a TV you bought on a credit card in a home you purchased with a no-money-down mortgage.

11. You take out $200,000 in debt to earn a degree in a subject you're not interested in, doesn't offer marketable job skills, and for which you have no intention of working in -- all by age 22. 

12. You're part of the roughly half of Americans who can't come up with $2,000 in 30 days for an emergency, even though you're also part of the roughly 100% of Americans who will need to come up with $2,000 in 30 days for an emergency at some point in your life.

13. The single largest expense you'll pay in life is interest. You'll spend more money on interest than food, vacations, cars, school, clothes, dinners out, and all forms of entertainment. You do this because you don't save enough and demand a lifestyle you can't actually afford. The future owns your income.

14. You're thrilled that the credit card you're paying 22% interest on offers 1% cash back on all purchases.

15. You spent the last five years arguing why Keynesian/Austrian economists were all wrong. The S&amp;P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC  ) spent the last five years rallying 177%.

16. You think dollar-cost averaging is boring without realizing that the purpose of investing isn't to minimize boredom; it's to maximize returns.

17. Your work in a stressful job in order to make enough money to have a stress-free life. You see no irony in this.

18. You're a pessimist in a world where far more people wake up in the morning trying to make things better than wake up thinking we're all doomed.

19. You try to keep up with the Jonses without realizing the Jonses are buried in debt and can probably never retire.

20. You think $1 million is a glamorously large amount money when it's what most people will need to cover their definition of a pretty mediocre retirement.

21. You associate all of your financial successes with skill and all of your financial failures with bad luck.

22. Rather than admitting and learning from your mistakes, you ignore them, bury them, make excuses for them, and blame them on others.

23. You anchor to whatever price you bought a stock for, without realizing that the market neither knows nor cares what you think is a ""fair"" price.

24. Your perception of history extends back about five years. This leads you to believe things like bonds are safe, the average recession is as bad as 2008 was, and we're in a new normal of high unemployment.

25. You come from a low- or middle- income household, don't qualify for scholarships, and think it's reasonable to attend a private college.

26. You aced your SATs and went to an Ivy League school. You think this qualifies you to be a financial genius without realizing that the single most important skill in finance is control over your emotions, not control over a Greek formula.

27. You say you'll be greedy when others are fearful, then seek the fetal position when the market falls 2%.

28. You worship ""legendary"" investors whose only real skill is marketing themselves. Their career track record probably lags a money market fund.

29. You think you can be a successful day trader when the hedge fund you're competing with can read a news report, figure out what it means, and place a trade, make a profit, and exit that trade in literally the time it takes you to click on said news report.

30. You let confirmation bias take control of your mind by only seeking out information from sources that agree with your pre-existing beliefs.

31. You think you're too young to start saving for retirement when every day that passes makes compound interest a little bit less effective.

32. You spend a month researching the best washing machine, then invest twice as much money in a penny stock based solely on a tip from a person you don't know and shouldn't trust.

33. You're investing for the next 50 years but get stressed when the market has a bad day.

34. You're willing to work hard for $15 an hour, but too lazy to spend four minutes to fill out your company's 401(k) paperwork that could result in thousands of dollars of free money from matching contributions.

35. You think you're doing great by building up an emergency fund that covers three months of living expenses when the average duration of unemployment these days is more like nine months.

36. You check your brokerage account more often when the market is going up than going down.

37. You size up the potential of investments based on past returns, rather than investments that (A) you understand, (B) have a competitive advantage, (C) fit your goals, and (D) sell for an attractive valuation.

38. You take something as mind-numbingly complex as the global economy and try to distill it down into small, elegant sound bites.

39. You don't respect the idea that ""do nothing"" are two of the most powerful words in investing.

40. You purchased investments from a guy wearing boat shoes with no socks, a blue shirt with a white collar, or suspenders This rarely ends well.

41. You feel especially smart after last year's 30% market rally without realizing that you had nothing to do with it.

42. You surround yourself with 18 hours a day of live market TV in a game that requires decades of doing almost nothing but waiting.

43. You seek advice from a doctor to manage your health, an accountant to do your taxes, a lawyer to manage your legal problems, a plumber to fix your plumbing, a contractor to build your house, a trainer to help you exercise, a dentist to fix your teeth, and a pilot to fly when you travel. You wouldn't consider doing it differently. Then, with no experience, you go about investing willy nilly, all by yourself.

44. Hindsight bias fools you into thinking you saw the last financial crisis coming. Worse, this fools you again into thinking you'll be able to predict the next one.

45. You think financial news is published because it has useful information you need to know. In reality, it's published only because the publisher knows you'll read it.

46. You forget that the single most valuable asset you have as an investor is time. A 20-year-old has an asset Warren Buffett couldn't dream about.

47. You don't realize that the guy giving advice on TV doesn't know you, your circumstances, your goals, or your risk tolerance. He doesn't really care about you, either. He just wants to be seen on TV.

48. You have a financial plan without realizing that life neither knows nor cares about your plan. Whatever your plan is today, reality will surely look far different tomorrow.

49. You start saving a little bit of money. Great! It's better than nothing, but I see a lot of people who are proud of their savings when in reality it's an infinitesimally small percentage of what they'll need to retire. As the saying goes, ""Save a little bit of money each month, and at the end of the year, you'll be surprised at how little you still have."" If you think saving 30% or more of your income is insane, run the numbers. It might be close to what you'll need to retire happy.

50. You think it's impossible to live on less than $35,000 a year without realizing that literally 99% of the world does, even adjusted for purchasing power parity.

51. Your definition of a middle-class lifestyle is a 3,000-square foot home, more bathrooms than family members, three SUVs, private colleges, annual trips to Hawaii and Vail, Evian water, and yoga lessons. (Seriously, just stretch in your own living room.)

52. You can't acknowledge the role luck plays when making the occasional successful investment. (Also true when worshiping investors who made one big call that happened to be right.)

53. You suffer from hard-core belief bias. It's the tendency to accept or reject an argument based on how well it fits your pre-defined beliefs, rather than the objective facts of the situation. Pointing out that inflation has been low for the last five years is still met with suspicion by those who believe the Federal Reserve's actions must be causing hyperinflation.

54. You think the hybrid car is a better financial deal because it gets better gas millage, even though it costs $10,000 more than a comparable gas-engine model. You'll probably need to drive for a decade before the hybrid upgrade pays for itself, but in reality you'll trade the thing well before then.

55. You hate finance, think it's confusing, and don't want anything to do with it. You do, however, love money. You see no irony in this.

56. You think the stock market is too risky because it's volatile, without realizing that the biggest risk you face isn't volatility; It's not growing you assets by enough over the next several decades.

57. You've never been to a poor country, robbing you of the realization that the world doesn't care how entitled you feel, what you think is ""fair,"" or what a real financial hardship is.

58. You think blowing money on frivolous stuff impresses people, when in reality it makes you look like an insecure, pompous, jerk. (This is particularly common among young people who come into money for the first time.)

59. You're unable to realize that a 10% return for 20 years generates more money than a 20% return for 10 years. Time can be a more important factor than return when building wealth -- and it's the one thing you have control over.

60. You don't respect the mountains of evidence showing that once basic needs are met, the amount of happiness each additional dollar of income provides diminishes quickly. This causes you to spend most of your life chasing ""the number"" you think will make you happy, but probably won't.

61. You think paying your financial advisor and other money managers 2% a year seems reasonable, without realizing that it'll probably eat up one-third or more of your long-term returns.

62. You think of the stock market as numbers that go up and down rather than an ownership stake in real businesses with real assets.

63. You think renting a home is throwing money away when for many it's one of the smartest financial decisions they can make.

64. Your investment decisions are guided by what the economy is doing, when the two really have very little correlation.

65. When planning for retirement, you don't realize that your life expectancy might be 90 years or more. Retire at 65, and you could spend more than one-third of your life living off your investments.

66. You're unable to have a good time going for a hike, a bike ride, a swim, reading a book, or anything else that's free (or cheap). Having cheap hobbies is a large, yet hidden, asset on your personal balance sheet.

67. You work so hard trying to make money that you don't have time to think about, or plan, your finances. This is the equivalent to spending so much time buying exercise equipment that you have no time to exercise.

68. To paraphrase Carl Richards, you ignore history, basing your actions on your own very limited experience.

69. You worry about things you can't control, and things that are not relevant to your own finances.

70. You went to college at age 18 not because you were ready but because everyone else was. It's probably one of the most expense things you'll ever do, and you totally caved to peer pressure.

71. You think that not changing your opinion about markets, the economy, and your investments is somehow noble, when it's really just shutting your brain off to the reality that things are always changing.

72. You ignore that how elderly Americans who have seen it all view money is almost the opposite of how most young Americans view money. This goes back to not learning vicariously.

73. You're uncomfortable with the idea that the biggest news story of the next decade is almost certainly something no one is talking about today, and the big stuff everyone is talking about today is probably meaningless.

74. You underestimate how fast a company can go from ""blue chip"" to bankrupt.

75. You don't realize that when you say you want to be a millionaire, what you probably mean is that you want to spend a million dollars, which is literally the opposite of being a millionaire.

76. You're unaware that the business models of the vast majority of financial companies rely on exploiting the fears, emotions, and lack of intelligence of its customers.

77. You nodded along to all 77 of these points without realizing I'm talking about you. That goes for me, too.",finance,1392224008
personalfinance,"30-year to 15-year fixed mortgage refinance question. Any suggestions would be helpful, details inside.","Our current principal balance on our mortgage is $120,000. It is a 30-year fixed with a 5.125% interest rate. We are currently paying for PMI but have been making additional payments of $150 per month and are almost at a point that we can have PMI dropped. We also have about $35,000 in student loan debt at around the same interest rate as the mortgage. We have no other debt. 

I am in the last semester of my MBA program that we paid for out of pocket without any loans. I am starting a new job in a few months with a decent pay raise. The plan is to use the money we were spending on tuition and the extra money from my pay raise to get our debt paid off as soon as possible including the mortgage. Our goal is within the next 5 years. 

I know our mortgage interest rate is high and we can get a much better rate by refinancing to a 15-year mortgage but does that make sense if we plan to have it paid off in 5 years?

It's the most big bank like thing I've encountered with Simple and I'm not thrilled with the policy (Bancorp's).

*edit* Title should read Refunds not Returns

***UPDATE***
They came thru and changed their policy!  Go Simple!

Hi ,

We recently had to reject a federal or state tax refund you submitted, because there were two names on the refund. We have some good news: our bank partner has revised its policy on accepting these returns! What does this mean for you?

- If you had an electronic transfer rejected, and you are receiving a check, you WILL be able to deposit that check into Simple.

- If you had a check rejected, and you have not yet deposited it elsewhere, you may attempt to deposit it again.

- If the check is over $3000 (or $2000 if your account is fewer than 30 days old and/or you’ve deposited fewer than 5 checks), you will have to mail it in, but it WILL be accepted as long as it is a federal or state tax return. (Directions for mailing checks can be found here: https://bank.simple.com/activity/faq/check-deposits)

- This only applies to federal and state tax refunds. Any other payment to you AND someone else will unfortunately still be rejected.

If we didn’t catch you in time to rectify the situation, we’re truly sorry. This has been a very difficult situation for many, and we are thankful for your patience and understanding. If you think there’s a way we may be able to help you sort this out, we are happy to help-- please give us a call at 888-248-0632.

But the graph on [coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/doge_30.html) isn't.

Let us calculate what it would take to get the chart of coinmarketcap (at its current zoom level) on the moon:

Distance Earth - Moon: **380'000 km**    
Distance 0 - 100'000'000 market cap on the graph: **5.3 cm**    
Market cap per cm (graph): **18.9 million USD per cm**

So **380'000 km * 18.9 million USD/cm** gives us a market cap of **$717 quadrillion**, which is **582'927 times** the amount of USD in circulation (including Federal Reserve notes)

For a total DOGE supply of **100'000'000'000** that means **$7.17 million per DOGE**

If the total amount of DOGE in circulation is infinite, then that means we would achieve a **$1 = 1 DOGE** ratio (given a stable market cap at the moon) after **136.4 million years**

personalfinance,NYC budget check in + housing questions,"I am a pretty private person about my / our finances. So I am definitely stepping out of my comfort zone here.  

OK. Deep Breath.   This is a throwaway.


My wife and I live in New York City. Manhattan currently. Recently Married &lt;1 Year. Both late 20s.  

We make combined 185K yr base salary. She’s in healthcare. I work in finance. I get a variable bonus, which was not so great this year: 15K.  I'd like to think in a very good year it could go as high as 100% of base pay, but I don't have it now so I guess it doesn't affect this review so much :). My job is a little volatile and it could blow up at any time, although I believe I would see this coming 6 months down the road. I also feel pretty secure regarding my ability to get another job, if needed, at a similar income. Might also be worth noting that my wife works in healthcare, so she could really work anywhere (where housing costs are lower), but me being in finance am pretty well tied to the city. 

We haven't really combined our budgets so much as just split our common expenses. 

My wife's net income is ~4890 / mo. Mine is ~4400/mo.

* Savings mine: 25K
* Savings joint: 11K
* Savings wife: 5K
* Some old investment accounts: 6K
* My 401K: 23K (amped up the savings significantly last year) 
* Wifes IRA: 43K 
* We've got a no frills car that I estimate is worth about 5K, paid off

Debts: No consumer debt we don't pay off each month

She has about 60K in student loans. Currently on income based repayment. Will be forgiven after 10 years of public service. This income based payment number will likely skyrocket in 2014 as 2013 was her first full year of employment. We're coming up on year #2 of her working in PS.

* Rent: 2800/mo
* My 401 contribution: 1200/mo (no match) This comes out of gross pay and was already taken out of my net pay number above.
* Savings contrib: 1715/mo to various accounts above
* Cable: 120/mo
* Electric: 78/mo
* Car insurance: 129/mo
* Parking: 325/mo
* Groceries 250/mo
* Student loans: 300/mo 

Here's the part where we're gonna get killed by you guys: 

We've got about 3,500/ mo in OTHER. This covers any vacations, travel, meals out, drinks, incidentals etc – basically our social life.  Everything gets charged on the credit cards (and subsequently paid off) so it’s not like I don’t know where it goes. 


Additional Color: The wedding/honeymoon put a pretty big dent in the budget /assets. Maybe we didn't realize it at the time but I bet we'd have 50K more in that bank if we just had eloped with a CZ. Our wedding / honeymoon was flipping awesome, I  wouldn't change it in anyway, but it's definitely worth noting. I didn't make a lot of money out of college and wasn't able to save particularly well for a few years, until I ended up down here.   

Re: NYC and lifestyle drift, this definitely occurred when I first moved down here in a few years back, and my 401K / Saving suffered for it. The above savings/401k and expense numbers represent an increased awareness to save more and spend less coming out of the wedding and into the end of last year. I don't have a huge issue with our 2014 budget, but I present it for your consideration. I am aware of how expensive the car is to keep here. We're weighting our options on it now.


Here’s my actual question:

We are going to need to move out of our apartment this fall, where I, and then we, have been since moving down. We've got a pretty competitive rent for a 1 BR right now, but I could also see rent heading upwards a bit, maxing out at 3500, if we want to stay in a 1 BR.  We don’t even really live in a particularly ‘desirable’ neighborhood right now, and I understand that a ‘super desirable’ neighborhood is still basically out of the question at a 3.5K price point. There will also be a broker fee associated with that move of at least 1 mo. rent, although I will be trying hard to avoid paying this.

My father in law is putting a lot of pressure on us to buy a place. “Interest rates are the lowest they will be in your lifetime”. “You are throwing money away on rent”, “housing prices are low”. I’m not certain the latter applies to NYC, real estate is white hot here right now, with the only hotter market being rentals. 

Basically he wants to give us up to 100K for a down payment. This money would have to be paid back to him at some point, either on sale of the apt or at another time in the future plus interest. This puts us at 146K for a down payment plus our projected savings of ~12K over the next 7 months. Any apt we purchase would need to be a 2BR, kids are in the five-year plan. Realistically the lowest home price I can see for a 2BR in a decent neighborhood is starting @ 700K. 20% down. So 140K down. 560K loan. So  ~3K for mortgage payment. Plus maintenance (which includes tax for co-ops) of 1K.  

Worth noting that if something catastrophic were to happen, I have a bit of a safety net with the in-laws, they’re not uber-rich or anything, but well off enough that they would help to support us were we to be facing default.  Can we afford 4K housing payments? Probably. There is room in our budget. Is it wrong to think of a mortgage as an additional  ‘savings’ account (less interest of course)? I haven’t even touched on closing costs for a mortgage of that size. Has to be 20K right? We’re in the process of getting pre-approved now, so I suppose I’ll find out soon enough. 

What do you think about this? Is it a bad idea to lay out so much of our savings for down payment? Does the whole “throwing money away on rent” argument apply at all here? What about the whole gift / repayment of down payment?

We've got a few options as far as I can see:

* Rent for another year at a similar rate to what we have now. Burn moving costs (knowing we would potentially move again next year).  Save our  22K + variable bonus over the next year and revisit this whole plan fall 2015. Who knows where interest rates will be then?
* Rent for another year at a LOWER rent. Move to a studio in Harlem or Queens. Save another 12K on top of the above figure and revisit this whole plan fall 2015.
* Buy. It feels like there are risks.
* Move to the burbs. Rent for a bit. Save. Buy a house (maybe under the same situation as above), have kids, and die (just kidding).",finance,1392238645
Bitcoin,Time to start discussing bitcoins future…,"Hi, I wrote this today and would like to know what your thoughts are. 

It is safe to say it has been an extremely turbulent time for the growing bitcoin community. Inside of just one week we have seen two bitcoin exchanges forced to halt their operations; Russia making moves to ban the currency and arrests in America surrounding money laundering allegations involving bitcoin.

It looks like bitcoin has reached a critical moment. In recent months bitcoin has been pushed up to global heights, but has the infant currency been pushed too hard and too fast? There are many examples of stardom reaching peoples head too young. You only have to look at the headlines surrounding Justin Bieber these days to see the effects of fame on an unprepared mind. Could this also be true for other things, say a currency?

Let’s think of it this way, what’s the first thing you would need to unleash an electric car on the public which could be charged at a petrol station? Infrastructure – plain and simple. After all what good would a chargeable car be if you couldn’t find somewhere to charge?

Keeping with that analogy - what good is a currency that is loosely defined with a weak infrastructure?

Now before we get ahead of ourselves and, more importantly, before I get an inbox stuffed with angry letters – let me articulate fully. By loosely defined I mean we don’t have a universal agreement on bitcoins implementation. Is bitcoin trying to compete with fiat currencies, like the British Pound and US Dollar? Is it an addition too – like modern PayPal? Or is it something more tangible, like gold and silver? Depending on who you ask you will always get a different answer, and this is a problem.

Bitcoin.org defines bitcoin as this:

    ‘Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence.’

From a regulatory perspective alone this arises confusion as digital money and cash for the internet could mean two different things. But from a public perspective this could be even worse. You only have to look at the bible to see how loosely defined terms can lead to much disagreement, disagreements with drastic consequences.

So what I am trying to say here?

Bitcoin has got awoken too early. It has reached maturity too soon and it is up to us to ensure it becomes a respectable member to society. We need to take coercive action now, to build a bright future for tomorrow.

As bitcoin is a decentralised system, this coercive action needs to be taken by us. We need to take bitcoins agenda to the next level – that is we need to democratise the process and all have an adult rational discussion about how bitcoin should be implemented.

We need to discuss:

    What exactly is bitcoin?
    How bitcoin should be implemented?
    Who should be our spokesperson?
    What system we should have in place to make broader decisions within the community?

This is what I am proposing, a democratised process where we all come to some agreement on how we should view bitcoin, how we should sell bitcoin to the public and how decisions at a future date should come about.

I also have some personal views to the questions I posed. I believe bitcoin has got some very strong features to add to the global economy. To me bitcoins strongest attributes are as a global money transmitter. That is, a system similar to Western Union or PayPal, but more extensive and cheap. Let’s look at it like this, if Company A based in the USA wanted to pay company B in Europe, then what better way is there then bitcoin? They could go through the traditional method of wire transfer, but this will take upwards of two days and cost 2%. They also could use PayPal or Transferwise, but this can take up to a day to clear and will still cost more than bitcoin. Bitcoin is obviously far superior in these areas than its competitors – an obvious place for it to sit in the market.

Let’s have a look at another feature bitcoin as a global money transmitter could provide – a currency exchange service. I propose that bitcoin could rid the need for travellers to carry cash to another country – you could just carry it on your phone instead. Once arriving at your destination, you could just trade your bitcoins with companies for their local currency. This again is a very strong attribute bitcoin has got, one that is often overlooked.

This would place bitcoin as an addition to normal fiat currencies. At this point I would like to quickly note that although I think the prospect of bitcoin over throwing more traditional currencies is somewhat exciting and romantic – I do also think that it is an unrealistic goal for such a young currency. We need bitcoin to find a place within the existing system - to help cement its future for all of us.

Now talking about cementing a future for all of us, one man does more for the bitcoin ‘project’ than anyone else I know – take a bow Andreas Antonopoulos. Personally I would like to see this guy promoted to CEO of the bitcoin foundation as he has the right attributes and determination needed for such a role.

So there you have it, if we want bitcoin to have a bright future we need to all start agreeing on what exactly bitcoin is, what it does and how decisions are made. After all bitcoin is supposed to reflect the opinions of its users – and if these opinions are split and divided then what does this say about the currency?

I am going to write up a follow up containing peoples feedback, which I will keep all of you posted on.

Also if people could check out my website and tell me areas to improve - it would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Need help formulating a personal finance plan! Lots of debt,"Hello, PF. I would like to formulate some sort of plan of attack for paying off my debt, establishing savings/emergency funds, and still maintain a decent budget to keep my sanity. I was hoping I could get some insight and suggestions.

My current debt breakdown is as follows:

* $130k in federal student loans (payments begin in August and I am eligible for PAYE. My average interest rate is 7.1% with individual rates ranging from 5.5-7.6%; payment will be about $400 this year)

* $19k in private student loans (2 lenders, payments of $116 and $95/month)

* ~6k in credit card debt spread over 4 cards. I recently transferred a big chunk to a 0% interest for 15 months Chase Slate card. the rest are high interest above 22%. Payments/month: 25, 25, 45, 52.

* $6.5k small business loans (2 loans, payments/month are $148 and $109).

Now a little more about my monthly finances: I bring in $4400 a month after taxes ($80k/yr before taxes) and my bills/loan payments come to about $1200/mo. This does not include monthly expenses such as gas, groceries, spending money, etc. Currently I am renting for $1200 a month and I have no car payment. My lease will be ending this summer and I will be moving in with my parents so I could pay off as much debt as I can before venturing out and looking to purchase a prospective home of my own. 

So, PF, these are my questions:
1. How should I tackle my existing debt? Do I pay off the high interest credit cards first, or should I pay off the business loans since that would free up about $260 a month that I pay towards them?
2. At what point should I consider renting/buying again? Pros and cons of the rent/own debate are welcome. Also, any advice on a condo vs. house?
3. Also, at what point in my debt repayment should I begin investing or saving for retirement and building my emergency fund? I already have a fund with my employer who does 1:2.5 matching and I contribute to that.

I understand there may be information I left out or may be needed for a proper assessment, let me know. 

Also, as another issue that may open up a whole new can of worms, how should I deal with my student debt? I obviously don't want to wait until I pay off that huge amount before investing and saving, should I just accept I will be paying that monthly payment for the life of the loans? 

Because I am eligible for PAYE and I owe so much, the calculator on the federal Dept. of Ed. website says I wont' actually ever repay my debt, but after the 20 year loan term I will have paid about $195k in interest , and $130k will be forgiven. At that point I know I will have to claim the forgiveness as income and will get a huge tax hit that year. In total I will have paid about $240k or so for these loans (monthly payments plus income tax on forgiven amount. Income tax is estimated.

Now this is where it gets weird. If I choose some of the other repayment methods that don't require an $1100-1600 monthly payment, I actually end up paying more on these loans (with interest), but eventually I pay off the whole amount during the life of the loan and nothing gets forgiven. Should I just suck it up and pay the low monthly payment with the PAYE option and then take the income tax hit on year 20? I feel like I would much rather accept that I am paying a low monthly payment for 20 years, than have a $1100+ payment and ultimately end up paying the same amount anyway.

solar,What do you think of my solar hot water scheme? It's very DIY and hopefully very cheap.,"The gist of it is that I have a SSE exposure and a pretty good spell of daylight on my roof. I was thinking I would buy some used solar hot water panels, run them in a closed loop system with glycol. I'd route them down into my basement into a heat exchanger made of copper pipes which would heat up water in an insulated concrete tank of about 12'x12'x5' in dimension. That's a rough dimension, I guess it depends on how many collectors I can fit on the roof. Math is yet to be done. 

That tank would be fed from city water on a float switch. It would in turn feed via pump a conventional oil-fired hot water heater. That's the heating for my house, hot water baseboard. 

Does this make sense? The main thing is that I can't fit a pressure tank of any size into my basement; any water storage must be built on site, thus the unpressurised system and extra pumps.

I'm hoping someone here might be able to provide some advice...The 50,000 foot details:

I'm newly married, spouse had roughly $200,000 in public student loans before we said ""I do"". We're in a community property state. I make about $140,000, she makes $60,000. It looks like if we file separately she will be insulated from my income, and will be able to pay less on her loans monthly (IBR). However, it looks like I'll lose about $10,000 from my return if we file that way. I have heard that she can break out her income by providing a ""Alternative Documentation of Income"" form to the Dept. of Education. I'm trying to make sure I don't get penalized too hard by filing separately. Some detail I found on this:


""The Department understands that Married borrowers who file their Federal income tax returns separately from their spouses and who reside in community property states may be disadvantaged when determining IBR eligibility when compared to similarly situated married borrowers in non-community property states. §§ 682.215(e)(1)(B) and 685.221(e)(1)(i)(B) and § 685.209(a)(5)(i)(B) authorize the use of alternative documentation of a borrower’s income if the Secretary or the FFEL loan holder believes the borrower’s reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower’s current income. Because the Department believes that it is inequitable to treat married borrowers who file their Federal income tax returns separately differently based on where they reside, we encourage FFEL loan holders to use alternative documentation of the borrower’s income under these circumstances. The Department will take the same approach with the loans it holds.""

personalfinance,Maybe a dumb question - do I actually need a separate savings account?,"Bit of background - I'm 21, work fulltime at a call center (a little above min wage), and am planning to return to school in the near future. I currently have just around 14k in the bank plus a small 401k account. 

Recently I was at the bank and they told me I was pre-approved for a credit card, so I researched it a bit and went back in a week later to open one. While I was working with the banker to get that done, he kept really pushing me to open up a savings account in addition to my checking account. I didn't really want to, but he kept pushing the issue so eventually I said okay, opened one, and dumped 5k from my checking account in there. 

As far as I know there's no fees but the interest rate is the exact same as on my checking: 0.01%. (He said this should increase soon because of ""the FED"" or something along those lines, but I get the feeling that isn't true.)

He told me if I put 15k in there, the savings account would be upgraded and I would start getting up to a 0.05% return, which...doesn't sound like a lot. I'm hoping to quit my job and go into one of the two-year programs at the local community college full time in the fall; a lot of what I've saved up is going to be eaten away by tuition and living expenses so I probably won't be in a situation to be gaining any benefit from having the savings account. 

Should I just close the account and transfer the money back into checking? Is there a benefit to having it separate? Why would they be so insistent - does they get something by having multiple accounts for me, even though the net cash I am putting into the bank is the same? It was weird how insistent the guy was on it, and I don't like feeling that I'm being manipulated into a bad decision.

I still hope you continue to read and enjoy them as much as I enjoy writing them for you. I also want to start including more relevant wikipedia links for further reading in the comments.

Here are the question I raised in my last post and which ones I answered. I already started with my answer for the third question until I was brought up short by the damnable character limit! So without further ado, I will continue with my explanation of fiat money. I will use fiat interchangeably with fiat money or fiat currency in these posts, unless otherwise specified.

* ~~Why is it called fiat money?~~
* ~~When was fiat money first used?~~
* How does fiat money retain its value?
* Where does fiat money come from?
* What advantages does fiat money have?
* Why are all reserve currencies fiat money?
* Is fiat money ""free""?
* Is fiat money stable?

To recap quickly what I've said so far on the topic of ""How does fiat money retain its value?"":

1. status as legal tender: Fiat money is the only method that can be used to pay taxes (with some very small exceptions). It is the unit of account that is used in all finance related industries in the country and businesses are usually required to accept it as a form of payment from its customers.

2. Wide acceptance: the fact that fiat can ultimately be used to pay taxes and that it is accepted by most businesses means that it can be used in almost all economical transactions without applying any sort of discount (compare that with representative money in systems with immature financial structures).

3. Stable monetary base: fiat retains its value because there is a limited amount. In theory there is no limit on how much fiat can be printed. If the money supply exceeds demand, prices rise because there is more money in circulation, which means inflation. This is not the case in practice due to point number 4:

4. Independent central banks: the road towards modern central banking was long and it took some hard lessons, but all succesful and stable fiat currencies have in common, that the central bank that governs the money supply has a degree of political independence, which ensures that the goal of price stability can't be circumvented for political gain, which would result in something called ""political inflation bias"".

Now while these are the basics, I would like to get a bit more into how these factors come together. At the moment, there is a lot of discussion about things like Quantitative Easing and the extremely low interest rate set by central banks. People fear that this may lead to higher inflation, but what it means in practice is often unclear. I won't actually go into the minutiae of how central banks try to affect the yield curve and other such technicalities, but the important thing to note, is that excess liquidity can only influence prices if it actually reaches the markets.

What does this mean? Well, the central banks are the banks that lend money to commercial banks. Only if the commercial banks actually then extend this liquidity to their customers, does the money reach the market and can influence price levels. As a result of the financial crisis, confidence in a lot of markets was shattered. This means that banks that were previously much too liberal in giving out loans to creditors were now becoming too stingy. We know that the ""subprime crisis"" kicked off the whole financial crisis, but the reason a financial crisis then turned into a worldwide economic downturn was because of the subsequent ""credit squeeze"". Banks were afraid of having too many bad assets in their balance sheets and in order to ensure that they wouldn't slip into bankruptcy, they had to increase their liquidity. This means they were hesitant to give out credit for small and medium businesses looking to invest and expand their businesses. 

And not only small and medium businesses were affected, increasingly bigger and bigger companies ran into cash-flow problems due to the unwillingness of banks to continue their line of credit.

This means that ultimately through the channel of the credit squeeze, the financial crisis was turned into an economy wide problem and snowballed from there. (This is not the only reason nor the only valid explanation, these causalities are complex, but it is a *relevant* reason in the context described here).

With this segue out of the way, you can see how markets are extremely sensitive to mood swings and things like confidence. This is because markets are always forward looking. Investments have to be planned, expected changes in the market have to be anticipated and prepared for, and last but not least, the ""first-mover"" is usually the biggest beneficiary if he backs the right horse. You can see this also in how much the early adopters are usually rewarded in cryptocurrencies, where the right nose can make you serious bank.

But to come back to what keeps fiat valuable: It's confidence. Confidence and trust in the market, confidence and trust, that the central banks are independent, that they keep to their mandate, that they make competent decisions. This means that central banks have to employ a lot of psychology in their decision making. It used to be the case, that shifts in the interest rate policy were sudden and unexpected, or only vaguely hinted at. Now the central bank has announced clear macroeconomic indicators which will signal the tapering (slow withdrawal from QE). Bernanke for example suggested that if inflation follows a 2% target rate and unemployment decreases to 6.5%, the Fed would likely start raising rates.

This is a complicated dance of expectations, announcements, macroeconomic data, predictions and mathematical modelling. But it is necessary and allowed for unparalleled expansion of our economies and is by some thought to be responsible for what is known as the ""[Great moderation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moderation)"". We live in a time of incredible stability and unparalleld growth. And fiat played a crucial role in making this possible.

But so far I sort of avoided a pressing question:

* Where does fiat money come from?

The easiest to get answer is of course, that money is printed by the treasury or central bank (depending on your country). This is the physical supply of money. What might surprise you is how little of the money supply in an economy is actually physical money: in the US the amount of physical money was around $915.7 billion in December 2010. The amount of ""broad money"" (or M2) was actually around $8853.4 billion. How can that be?

Now it gets complicated. Because we have something called ""[fractional-reserve banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking)"" we have a number of designations floating around, there is the monetary base, there is the money supply, there is the money multiplier, there are things called M0, M1, M2 and M3 money supply, there is physical money (Bank notes and coins).

Fractional-reserve banking means that when representative money like bills of credit came into use, the people holding the gold (in England usually goldsmiths) noticed that not everybody redeemed at the same time and that not everything was usually accessed at the same time either. So they started investing the deposits into other business ventures or gave credit in order to get interest on the deposits. As long as they held an adequate reserve of gold available, they were (usually) able to honor bills of credit that were supposed to be redeemed, while at the same time having the benefit of not leaving the gold to rot in their vaults.

The same thing happens with fiat: Banks have a reserve in terms of physical money as well as in terms of deposits with the central bank. The deposits they receive are then for a large part reinvested in the form of a loan or in other financial instruments. The recipient of this money can then of course deposit that money at another bank, which will then also take some of the deposited money and reinvest it. This is where the ""money multiplier"" comes from. Alternatively you can look at [this picture](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Money-creation.gif)

So let's get to the definitions. Please note that for the sake of simplicity I will keep to the definitions used by the central bank. These differ slightly from whatever country you may be from, but the actual specifics are less important than the implications and understanding of these concepts:

* Monetary Base

The total sum of reserves that commercial banks (banks that serve only other banks and stand between the central bank and other consumer banks) have with the central bank + the amount of physical money


Now the different money supply definitions in order of liquidity:

I understand I can not file my 1098-E if we file separately which is a 2000-2500 tax deduction for me. Although filing together with the new income would increase my loan payments about $1000 a year not including the portion from my own raise, until I investigate other options.

My question is if we file married jointly how should we file our W-4s as new DINKS filing for the first time with these conditions? Sometimes my math comes up that it would be best I file 2 exemptions and her 0. Sometimes best to file 1 and 1. 

On the other hand how can I calculate if it is beneficial to file separately without waiting around until the end of the year (not sure how to forcast this.)

financialindependence,403(b) withdrawals after 55,"I recently discovered that 403(b) early withdrawals can be penalty free after 55 yo (but before 59.5 yo) if there has been separation from employment. As I happen to fall in that gap, I've been seriously thinking about leaving my employer. If I do, then I will have to decide whether to keep the 403(b) monies with the carrier (TIAA-CREF) or roll them over into some other vehicle, with the caveat that I will want to start drawing on the funds immediately.

I realize that this decision is usually predicated on the tax implications, so I've been playing around with different scenarios for 403(b) withdrawals (for current income) to see how small I can get the tax burden for a situation where I am married, with one child, no other income.  I calculate that I can withdraw $36,000 per year and incur less than 1% in federal taxes (when the various child, personal, and standard deductions are accounted for).

**Background:** I'm a 23 year-old male living outside Boston and working in the city. I've been at my company since I graduated and have taken on a few different roles and am now making a little bit more than when I first started. Additionally, I've just quit drinking as a personal, financial and fitness-oriented experiment. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/AEJGAEd.png) is a picture of the budget I believe I can adhere to. 

**HELP** While any critiques of that will be welcomed, I don't have a ton of flexibility in the cost of my utilities as I live with 3 people to keep rent down (and because they're awesome). My two main unfortunate expenditures are my student loans, which I (like many others) took out with little knowledge of repercussions so I could attend my dream school (hooray) and dental bills (dealt a bad hand on that one) which are currently in the process of amassing. 

**Questions:**
Is it at all possible for someone with interest rates as absurd as mine to refinance or consolidate to bring them down? I'm able to pay more than I am per month if necessary. 

Has anyone taken out a loan to pay for medical expenses? What's the best way to go about doing so?

economy,I can't stop thinking about how interest rates have come down almost linearly over the past 34 years. From 15.2% in 1981 to around 2-3% today.,"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/talking-numbers/222-years-interest-history-one-chart-173358843.html

That chart shows it.

Every single time the economy has run in to trouble since the early 1980s, the Federal Reserve has stepped in to keep it from really getting out of hand. By doing this, they've stopped many potential deflationary episodes from occurring. In the following graph you can see inflation has been pretty steady over the same time period - especially compared to previous decades:

http://www.uri.edu/artsci/newecn/Classes/Art/INT1/Eco/D_A/Gif/Inf_long.gif


This is just a little personal theory, take from it what you want but - I think that the Fed has squeezed all of the demand possible out of the economy in our current Era (last 30 years) by lowering interest rates whenever any deflationary pulse began to materialize - a practice that is taught as standard procedure in almost any economics program in the U.S. today. Without a period of letting private consumer goods go to waste for a bit - be it out of style, old tech, etc - levels of demand aren't able to shoot back up quickly they way they used to naturally go back up in the past. If 70% of the economy is consumer spending, and it has been completely saturated with cheap stuff from China - then you're going to have a bad time when the fed can no longer prop up demand any longer.

I feel as if we're in the midst of a time when the Fed will have to make interest rates negative or risk another recession. Which is why all the talks of negative interest rates have been floating around again recently (very much like 2009-10).

I also think that next up for the economy is a Japanese style recessionary period because the Fed can only make interest rates so negative. Consumer goods will have to go to waste for a bit, and levels of demand allowed to naturally raise back up on their own over time, for the economy to get going again.",finance,1392337018
personalfinance,Sick of my rental property!,"My husband and I moved back home two years ago from a 3 year adventure living away from home that went poorly. While we could wash our hands of most of the experience, we purchased a house before we even officially moved up there (we are a young couple, I know how stupid this was now). We were unable to sell the house, which is in northern Montana, and have been renting it out off and on for the last two years. I do not want to be a property manager, and we now live 350 miles away from the house. My husband wants to keep the house as a future investment, but our current budget is at the point that I don't feel comfortable having it if we lost a tenant for a few months. In addition, we moved into a trailer that we would like to work on and can't afford repairs to both places. The place has already cost us a considerable chunk of money in home repairs. I attached my budget just for a better idea of our situation. Currently the rent is barely covering the mortgage. We had to reduce the rent to what it is at because it sat for a few months without a tenant. We have about 84% left of a mortgage that has an interest rate of 4.5%, and a refinance would require us to have at least 25% paid off. 

My question: I want to get rid of this place or at least bring in a relatively decent amount of income from it. What would be my best options?

CryptoMarkets,Mintcoin is pretty cool and you should know about it,"Hi fellow crypto traders/miners.

Yesterday I read something about a coin named mintcoin.
Actually it was on this subreddit.
I googled it and did not even find the website of this coin, neither did i find any information about it.


So I did a little bit of research and here is what i've found:

Mintcoin was launched on febuary 6th and is a coin with Proof of Work distribution and Proof of Stake security.
So what does this mean. This means that in the first 5 weeks most of the coins get mined through Proof of Work, as you know it.
After every week of this phase the block reward halves and less coins get distributed.
After 5 weeks, the PoW payout will be fixed at 1 coin per block.



**But how do we secure the network you might ask?**

This is when Proof of Stake comes to play. I quote wikipedia:
&gt; When generating a proof-of-stake block, the user sends some money to themselves, consuming their coin age in exchange for a preset reward. This minting transaction becomes more likely to succeed over time until a valid block is found, generating a new block on the blockchain and a payout for the proving user. This process secures the network and gradually produces new coins over time without consuming significant computational power.

[Wiki: Proof of Stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake)


So essentially what will happen is that the coins network security in five weaks will move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake.


**So whats the big deal about it?**
Many coins get created these days and some of them, for example vertcoin, are said to be the successor of maybe litecoin, because they are ASIC-blocking.
Mintcoin will also be ASIC-blocking because it will not make any sense in three weeks to mine it with hardware. All you need to do is buy some mintcoins, store them in your wallet and leave it there. Now here is the thing.

The longer your coins are unspent, the more powerful your stake will be, so you as an investor will help securing the network by actually be doing nothing :D
The best thing about it: As any miner you will be rewarded by securing the network.

I quote the official bitcointalk thread:
&gt; MintCoin also adopt a variable PoS rate, which gives the highest payout at 20% the first year, then decrease 5% per year until the 4th year it reaches annual interest rate of 5%, then it will remain at this rate. 

Of course you will not need to wait a full year to receive a 20% return by mining the coin.
After 20 mintcoin days destroyed you will get your first earnings in your wallet.


**Where do I trade it?**
Right now there are three exchanges trading the coin:

- https://www.mintpal.com/market/MINT/BTC

- https://www.newaltex.com/exchange/mint_btc

- https://coin-swap.net/

I can definitely recommend you mintpal.com. Its based in the UK, has an awesome coin voting feature and is fast as hell.


**Is this the right time to get in?**
I probably is! Right now, all coins are getting distributed. Even if you are not interested in trading your money into mintcoin, you could also mine it.
Mining right now is also pretty profitable. Even with some shitty hardware, I have a ATI HD4870 and I mined about 1500 coins in about 2 hours.

Just think about it this way: The coin cost 6 satoshis right now.
Even the shittiest coins with less then 0,5 BTC Volume a day made it to more then 100 satoshis.
Feel free to look it up on cryptsy yourself: https://www.cryptsy.com/ .
**Mintcoin is traded at mintpal.com at 72.926 BTC Volume.**
So it is most definitely the best time now to buy your coins, get active in the community and do stuff :)

dogecoin,Just some questions :),"Hey... after some days of mining im prette okay with it.

But there are still some questions bothering me.

1) I got hooked up with dogecoin through a video someone explaining it + a tutorial how to set up a miner. He used Dogehouse and now Iam using it. Is Dogehouse okay? I tried only another Pool once, but i didn't feel comfortable, so I switched back. What would you guys prefer? 

I got atm a GeForce GTX650 and in another system a GTX660.

2) The halving was some hours ago. What the heck happened since? I know, the block rewards halfed, but what are the consequences? (does this word exist? lol). The price dropped to ~168 satoshis. Will it rise again? How will it rise again? Why will it rise again? Much confuse.

3) Iam looking into building a mining rig. All this stuff with setting up, tweaking and even building a whole system just for mining is my definition of joy. I even created a list with parts, but Iam unsure if this will work. At first I can only afford ond GPU, ASUS R9 270. It will get me ~450kh/s. Then I picked the AMD Sempron 145, MSI 970A-G43, Corsair AX860 PSU. Will this work together? Is it some good system to start off? I know, only if I can afford to lose the money, but, when I lose it, I'd still have a nice gaming rig :)

3.1) My plan was to use Windows 8(.1) on this mining rig. I use myself Windows 8 and I can't complain. But now I heard from BAMT. Is it so much more better? What are the pros and cons? 

4) Are there any mechanisms to shut down the PC at some points? Iam not questioning how, just if there is any. Lets say, if on of the cards reaches 95°C, the shut down the miner automatically. If the PSU uses more Watts than it can handle. Are those security mehcanisms a thing? I would be very unsecure If iam at work and my mining rig starts a little bonfire at home...

5) Where do you guys get [those](http://pics.ricardostatic.ch/2_725574596_Big/grafikkarten/litecoin-ltc-mining-rig-3000-kh-s.jpg)  fancy frames? Those look so prebuilt but I cant find it anywhere...

6) I know there is kilo hash per second. I know there is a difficulty. I know there is a block reward. But how the heck can you calcualate the amount of Dogecoin out of it? Or am I missing something?

7) Can somebody explain in a short way, or post link, what exactly are blocks? I read much about it, but never really got it...

dogecoin,Doge DNS ?! [Serious],"Hi fellow Shibes!

To spread the Doge even further, it is important to work on its ease of use, right?
These enourmously long Doge-keys are a hassle to work with (try to write one down!) and scares the shit out of low-tech people (I thought it was a bit intimidating in the beginning).


So this is my idea: Why don't we have a **Doge-address Lookup system**?
A DNS lookup service for this incredibly bulky Doge key, provided by some trusted entity.
It would make the wallet so much easier to use, **you'd just send** your Doge to AddressMail or AuntBlabla75 or Dogemas and there you go!

Of course, this should be integrated in the wallet application.


Sure, there are flaws:
1) The trusted intity must be trustworthy
2) As in real DNS it can be spoofed if you run a DNS-client service

To address flaw nr 2 we could have a check system based on a RSA authentification (the secret key must never get out though) or as Doge is in itself, on the P2P network.


This is just a draft but what do you think of it?

Bitcoin,Announcing Bitcoins for Tax Returns and other accounting work!,"Greetings /r/Bitcoin! 

I'm not sure how much of a demand for this there might be, but I figured I'd give it a shot. My business partner is an accountant (in fact, he is now a qualified CPA), while I myself am into investing in online currencies. So we thought, well, why not connect the two? Why not offer accounting services to the Bitcoin community?!

You may not know this, but TurboTax is extremely bare bones. Sure, it gets the job done for most tax returns, but we have this theory that Bitcoin users are slightly more money savvy than needing to use TurboTax or H&amp;R Block (by the way - H&amp;R tax professionals are trained with a six week course, that THEY pay for themselves. Meanwhile, my guy is a fully qualified CPA and his staff have years of experience. Different league of experience here.) 

So here's my pitch: We're offering accounting services in the Bitcoin community, starting with US tax returns. We handle your Federal and State returns, and the price includes the e-file cost, plus digital and paper copies for your records.

If you have any concerns, we're available for a free consult. Just give us a call, or send an email on our website in the contact section. Or message me on Reddit! Whatever works for you =).

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage with 401k loan?,"I am healthy financially, but hate having debts of any kind. I am saving for a house and investing in retirement/stocks/ira, but have been agressively paying down my morgage from my investment property, which only has about $13k left.

Then I will be able to focus more on saving for a house and other things I have wanted to do. Plus, repaying myself with interest for the loan, and I'm not planning on leaving my job for a while.

personalfinance,Medium-term investments,"So, I have recently finished building up my EF and have started contributing to my employer-matched 403b. I don't have enough to max out my contributions yet, so I have not yet started a Roth IRA.  I like to be conservative with my estimates, so I have a **$100/month** buffer zone between my expenses and income so I don't have to dip into my EF except for in true emergencies.

My question is, **what should I do** with this leftover buffer money?  I'd like to prepare it for medium-term savings, meaning **I may want this money before I retire, but I don't intend to use it for a while** and want it to grow faster than my savings account.  I see three option on what to do with it and I am looking for advice on which path to follow:

* Put it in a **Roth IRA** (If I understand correctly, I can still withdraw based on what I put in, but I can't touch the earnings until retirement)
* Put it into a **regular brokerage account** and pay taxes on any earnings from investment
* Keep it in a **CD** or similar with a better interest rate than my current savings account

BTW, I'm in my early 20s, so I do expect my salary to increase and be able to max out my 403b and Roth IRA (backdoor-Roth when the time comes) and then my choice will be easier to make.

personalfinance,Law school or job?,"My options are

Cornell Law School- Legal field is overall shaky but Cornell still has decent prospects. Despite a decent external partial scholarship I will still probably be looking at around 100k in debt, in addition to 5k in debt I have from undergrad. About half their graduates land high paying corporate law jobs (100k+) but the burnout is very high for those. Many are also able to get low paying public interest work but with loan assistance. Overall it seems most alumni are able to do alright for themselves in the long run but it certainly isn't a sure thing. 

My other option is a 34k job with good benefits(federal) and potential to make 65k after 8-10 years. 

Other factors are that I currently live with parents and would like to get out and be independent asap. I don't like the prospect of 100k+ debt staring me down as major debt scares me. Nevertheless it is hard to say no to an ivy league JD.

personalfinance,401k/Roth 401k and Long Term Investments,"Hello all,

I was doing some reading on the FAQ regarding the standard line of thought on long term investments, neatly generalized thus - http://imgur.com/PWfvdvB - and I was wondering how Roth 401k options factored into the equation, specifically does that make the 401k more attractive than a Roth IRA, before considering actually maxing out my 17.5k contributions?

Some information: 26 years old, salary this year of 58k, I can expect an annual bonus of 15-25% depending on my performance and firm performance. I have been doing 10% contributions to my 401k, all standard non-Roth thus far for six months.

I currently live in NYC, and, based on what I have read both for and against Roth vs traditional 401k (this entire thread, also, including IRA info http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/18zgci/us_lets_talk_retirement_taxes_fees_and_penalties/) I really don't know what percentage to do to traditional/Roth at this time.

Employer match will kick in this August for me, 3%. Over the next three years it will increase to 4.5% if I increase to 6%, however I intend on contributing over 6% regularly if it makes sense to do so.

I probably cannot realistically max my 401k at this salary level as I am paying down 62k or so in student loans. I currently have about $8500 saved and was intending on spending most of that, save 2-3 months expenses, on my highest federal loans.

Is there any additional information that would be helpful for me to provide? I'm pretty new to this. Thank you.",finance,1392429845

Bitcoin,How Do You Demonstrate The Technological Power Of Bitcoin Without Making It Seem Overwhelming?,"This is one of the most frustrating problems I've had with convincing people to get involved with crytpocurrencies. Bitcoin's technology and the infrastructure behind it is extremely complex, but the application itself is very easy to use. The problem is that people will not put their money into something they don't trust, so you need to go in depth explaining why it is secure. The problem becomes worse when you spend more than 1 minute explaining the exact technology; you overwhelm them and all they think is ""this is much too complicated for me to use"", and they forget about it.

If I simply explain the perks of Bitcoin, they seem generally interested; however, almost everyone seems to question its security. Some common questions:

""What if someone hacks the network and prints tons of Bitcoins?""

""What if the creator runs away with everyone's Bitcoins?""

""What makes Bitcoins more ""secure"" than credit cards?""


I can answer all of these questions, but the problem is that if I do, it makes the currency seem way too difficult to use. I try to emphasize that while there's tons of math and computer code behind it, using it is extremely easy. I compare it to how their cellphone may have complex circuitry and code inside of it, but texting their friends and using apps is easy for them. The US dollar may have complicated economics behind it with federal reserve banking and control of money supply, but in the end to you it's as simple as exchanging a paper note with a designated value. Even with all of this, they just seem overwhelmed and forget about it.

I feel as though many people also cannot appreciate it's technical features as well. Decentralization, low fees, open source, and security means nothing to them-they just want to keep using what they've grown accustomed to.

Is there any effective way to prove that the Bitcoin network itself is secure, without scaring people away out of how nerdy and complicated it sounds?",cryptocurrency,1392437524

- Technology aspect: Attributes of currency (max amount, blocktime, diff adjust, distribution algo)
- Technological improvements: MEOW's new adjustments or Fedoracoins' integrated mixing function
- Community: mostly amount of subscribers of reddit branch, volume in google search
- Team behind the coin: communication to exchange/pool managers, communication with the community, drive to bring the coin forward
- Relevancy: Trading volume, current market capitalization, payment platforms like fedoracoins' (is this real?)

This makes TIPS, MEOW and DOGE quite strong in my eyes. The fact that MEOW coins get traded in a higher volume than LTC (!!) shows us that new cryptocurrencies are likely to replace LTC as second alternative to Bitcoin. 
Now is the time to use alternative cryptocurrencies as ""pennystocks"": throw in some money and maybe make 500% in winnings.

From the end of 2013, Goldman Sachs have now downgraded their forecast of 1st Qtr 2014 GDP growth from 3.2% to 1.9% in 3 separate steps in 6 weeks.

http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/02/january-jobs-report-is-significant.html

REAL unemployment, including discouraged workers, actually INCREASED in 2013 by around 600,000 people. 

The headline unemployment rate has only come down over the last 3 years because millions of people, of working age, have given up looking for work because there are simply no decently paid jobs out there. It's not even worth looking to try and find a decently paid job. 

The Labor participation rate has dropped by 3% from 2007 and it is still falling at an alarming rate. That is ~7.5 million people that are not working, but probably would be, if there was a strong jobs fuelled recovery, but there hasn't been any real recovery at all for ordinary people. There has only been a recovery for the wealthy, CEO's, financial speculators and casino bankers etc.

Chart of Labor Participation rate - last 10 years https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BghOFIzCIAA2zdG.png

Due to the current disastrous policies of both parties and the Federal Reserve :-

2014 is set to see only 2% GDP growth, or maybe a bit below, (far below current mainstream forecasts) with a probable very severe and prolonged recession starting in 2015. 

Unless of course current government and Federal Reserve policies were to be completely reversed. 

In order for the economy to be able to grow :- 

Bottom up spending and disposable incomes of ordinary people need to start increasing again, instead of being devastated as they currently are. 

I advocate cutting Corporate Welfare by $1.3tn a year and using that money for massive tax cuts for the LOWER paid. 

Raising the income tax thresh hold from $9,100 to $45,000 and reversing the 2% payroll tax hike would cost $600bn a year. 

Closing all Corporate Tax loopholes and tax breaks would allow the official Corporate Tax rate for every company to be set at 25% and be revenue neutral. 

Currently the average actual Corporate tax rate of a S&amp;P 500 (or large company) is about 12%.

The average Corporation tax rate paid by small and medium sized business is 29 or 30%. 

Every company should pay the same rate. 

I then advocate making the first $100,000 of profits to be made tax free to give small and medium businesses a boost and to encourage new business start ups (which have declined significantly since 2008).  

Small and medium sized business and new business start ups are the true job and wealth creators in America - not multinational Conglomerates that outsource loads of jobs to China. 

What do you want to do with the rest of the over $500bn a year we have just saved? 

We could spend a few of these billions on repairing some bridges that are about to collapse and give some work to some of the over 2 million construction workers that are either still unemployed from the 2008 housing crash, or have had to make do with lower paid, lower skilled work.
 
The details of the budget that should be on the table, other things that need to be done to get America out of the hole it has dug for itself; and the list of items that add up to over $1.3tn of Corporate Welfare, wasteful military spending and other forms of blatant government waste are at the bottom of this.

By Joseph Stiglitz 
http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105

The budget and debt ceiling deals continue the increasingly extremist Fascist policies of the last 30 years. We are now seeing over $2tn a year being redistributed from the Middle Class to the top 0.1% via $1.3tn of annual Corporate Welfare and the continuing $780bn a year of subsidies and over $500bn a year of bail outs being given to the big banks.

This will severely harm the economy, as we have seen over the last 14 years and particularly the last 5.

No economy can withstand the theft of 14% of it's economy in order to enrich the already wealthy elites.

We have seen rapidly rising rates of poverty, very high unemployment, falling wages, rising inequality and no decently jobs being created.

Meanwhile people like Jamie Dimon are awarded a 74% pay rise, purely because of the money given to JP Morgan by the government. JP Morgan would be making massive losses without these massive government subsidies.

U6 unemployment is now at 13%.

Real unemployment if we include the millions of people who have left the labor force simply because there are no jobs available for them to do is now over 23% and steadily rising.

The budget and debt ceiling deals will accelerate these worsening trends and if left unchecked cause a major depression.

We can expect very slow economic growth in 2014 (2% or less) and the probable start of a very deep and prolonged recession in 2015 as the direct result of current government and Federal Reserve policies.

dogecoin,Question on cryptos in general,"Hello shibes, I must get much critical, and I've never felt comfortable enough to discuss this with someone who could enlighten me, lest I become embarrassed shibe.  But i think that the nice folks here will engage with me in friendly manners.

I was always very critical of bitcoin, and I didn't give cryptos a passing glance, because I think they're really dumb and worthless. However, now that I have some doge floating around, and I see how fun and easy it is to tip, gamble, and eventually purchase any kinds of goods with doge, I get it now.  There is legitimate measurable value in instant, permanent transactions.  I can load up a tipbot with monies, and not have to wait 3-4 business days for it to transfer.  That's really cool.  However, some of my original concerns still apply.  To me, it seems like inventing a new currency, and mining it from the first block, is the ultimate scam.  Obviously that currency has no value until others mine it, and you give it away, and get everyone interested.  Dogecoin has done just that.  By being generous and open, the currency has become very popular. And people (like myself) who just bought in with fiat, still get a ""fair trade"".  No one made me buy a bunch of dogecoins.  But obviously one of the reasons I bought in, is that I think it will be worth more in the future.  A lot of crypto people think fiat is a scam because of numerous reasons.  I won't get into any of that, but basically, a lot of it is about bankers having power and the system not being fair and so on.  But my question is how is this any more fair?  Not everyone can afford a mining rig, which have better returns/power.  Not everyone heard about it soon enough.  If we wanted a fair currency, why don't we give everyone in the world 100k doge and see what happens?  I know there is a lot of tipping going on, but the rich are still rich.  And for me, I threw in 1k for the bobsled team, and I put 1k in my tipping account.  And that's what I was comfortable giving away based on my doge net worth.  Everyone is going to have their own generosity levels, but I doubt anyone is giving away all of their doge.  So the generous tipping and philanlthropic culture, I think, has to be taken with a grain of salt.  We raised thousands and I think with all of the charity combined, tens of thousands of dollars worth of doge.  But our market cap it like 75million.  Generous people donate fiat just as readily, I think.  Most people are prepared to part with a few bucks, depending on the cause, which is basically the equivalent of what we have done. Obviously some big players donated huge amounts.  But those big players, I'm sure, HAVE huge amounts.  There are people who donate millions of dollars too, it's not unique to doge.

I'm not angry or argumentative, I do love dogecoin, and think it's really fun.  All I'm asking is what do people here think makes crypto currency better/more fair than fiat?  Just because there isn't a central bank, doesn't mean a small number of people control a huge amount of the market, which is essentially the same thing (Look at gold in the 1890s-turn of the century, before financial regulations and fiat money, banks could manipulate crop prices by hoarding and flooding the market with gold, based on whether it was harvest or planting season.  Not through a centralized monetary policy, but just by being big fish in a little pond).

Thank you for the responses friends.  I hope I don't hurt anydoges feelings.  I don't dislike the doge-rich.  Without them, we wouldn't have doge to begin with.  Just trying to learn!",cryptocurrency,1392489148

personalfinance,Income Based Repayment of Student Loans Can Be a Good Thing,"From my general observations, it appears that /r/personalfinance is very dismissive of the various income passed repayment plans available for federal student loans. I find this one-size-fits-all advice somewhat surprising in light of the good analysis that is generally provided on this subreddit. I don't think the automatic ""rice and beans"" advice that is generally provided when someone faces significant student loans is particularly helpful and may be harmful. At the very least, an analysis of the specifics of each situation are merited. 

Upon a more sophisticated analysis, it quickly becomes apparent that these plans can be a very good deal - particularly for a certain subset of borrowers. These borrowers are often, but not always, recipients of professional degrees that can be very, very expensive such as doctors, lawyers, and MBAs. There are numerous discussions out there about how the income based repayment plans may not have been designed with these people in mind and therefore that the plans can provide an exceptionally good deal to such individuals.

From here on out I'll talk about the Pay As You Earn repayment plan (PAYE, formerly known as ICR-A). PAYE is generally the most generous of the repayment plans and fortunately I was able to qualify for it. Under PAYE you pay 10% of your discretionary income for 20 years and then the remaining balance is forgiven. (This forgiveness is a taxable event, which I'll discuss more below.) Discretionary income is defined as your AGI minus 150% of the poverty line. Therefore, as an example, if your AGI is exactly 150% of the poverty line (or less) then payments will be zero.

The reservations I've observed on this subreddit towards these plans have basically fallen into two camps. The first is that the borrower is prolonging the inevitable by minimizing their payments and that this may be making the situation worse since they may be negative amortizing. The second is that they're going to get hit by a ""tax bomb"" when the loan is forgiven. As to the first, PAYE provides three protections: (1) the federal government will pay the interest on some loans for up to three years in some circumstances, (2) interest will not be capitalized while the borrower has a partial financial hardship (defined to mean that payments under a standard 10 year repayment plan would exceed payments under PAYE), and (3) capitalized interest is capped at 10% of the original principal. This last point is crucial because it applies to all borrowers under PAYE, factors into the ""tax bomb"" analysis, and provides a certain amount of predictability 20 years out. As for the second issue (the ""tax bomb""), this is a very real concern. As the law is written now, any amount forgiven will count as income in the year of forgiveness and therefore be taxed. This could result in a very significant one-time tax bill. But recall that the amount will be capped at the original principal plus 10% since the rest of the interest won't be capitalized. Ideally, a person should save up a significant chunk of change over the 20 years to pay this tax bill. That's what I plan on doing. However, my political bet is that this part of the law will be eliminated within 20 years (i.e., before the first ""class"" of borrowers under PAYE have their loans forgiven). Efforts to eliminate the ""tax bomb"" are already under way. And the amount of political pressure that will result from potentially huge numbers of middle class families owing very large one-time tax bills will likely be potent. My basic approach: plan for the worst, hope for the best.

When I started looking into all of this, I tried to do as exhaustive an analysis as I could. I talked to anyone I could who might be helpful. Other students and I had extensive conversations with the financial aid dean at my school (who happens to be very good; his office has conducted research about various ramifications of these repayment plans), deans at other schools (most of whom were not very good and didn't even know how the income based repayment plans worked), attorneys at the Department of Education who were in charge of guiding the various pieces of legislation through Congress and then implementing it, and a consultant who specializes in the income based repayment plans (particularly for attorneys, doctors, and MBAs). 

With the assistance of these various individuals, I analyzed every conceivable trajectory my life and career might take over the next 20 years. In virtually every single one I came
 out ahead under PAYE - even when considering the tax bomb. In fact, the only ones where I didn't come out ahead under PAYE were the ones in which I was incredibly successful in my career (thus increasing my income and my payments in turn). That's a risk I'm totally willing to take because there isn't really a downside. Under those circumstances, you can look at PAYE as a method of hedging your bets. In the end, I was so confident in the analysis that I retroactively increased my student loans (keep in mind that this doesn't increase the monthly repayments because the only variable in that determination is your income) and I wish I could have borrowed more.

I think one of the primary things that people forget when automatically dismissing income repayment plans is the discount rate. Discounting out 20 years significantly reduces the present value of those repayments. Of course this may assume that the borrower opting for PAYE is actually investing the money instead of using the reduced payments under PAYE to inflate their lifestyle. I'm investing every penny that I'm saving under PAYE. I live on well under $1,000 per month and invest all the rest. I'm maxing out my 401(k) and Roth IRA and  contributing monthly to taxable account - things I wouldn't have been able to do under a traditional repayment plan.

I'm not advocating a one-size-fits-all approach in the opposite direction (i.e, that everyone should get on an income repayment plan). I'm certainly aware that choosing an income based repayment plan can be a terrible decisions for some people. But that doesn't mean it's a bad decision for everyone. The determination needs to be done on a case-by-case basis. There are numerous other factors that I considered in my analysis (e.g., possible early retirement, career changes, availability of credit, marital status, children, which repayment plans are available to the borrower) that I didn't mention above but that will play a part in the analysis and therefore further indicating that we should avoid overly simplistic analysis.

TL;DR: Run the numbers before advising people to steer clear of income based repayment plans.",finance,1392498546

I'm probably not the first person to think of this, but it seems to me that the mechanism for Federal student loan interest calculation can be gamed by increasing the interval at which you make payments.

(Number of days between payments/365.25)= Monthly interest

dogecoin,So here's the thing about Doge... (and why we're Moon bound),"I've seen a number of posts that address Doge and compare it to thiscoin or thatcoin (which, as an aside, would be terribly cool names for altcoins) and other posts that explain why Doge will never be so fortunate as to reach a dollar. 


These posts usually cite Bitcoin (understandably, as it set the model) and explain how the sheer difference in the number of bitcoins (once they're all mined) versus the final number of Doge are what sets them apart and will forever keep Doge in the &lt;1 range. But I think that only applies if you see Dogecoin and Bitcoin as the same beast. They are not. And arguably, they will never be. 


The way I see it (and I've seen this comparison before) bitcoin is a commodity, not unlike gold or silver or any precious metal. It is watched closely. It is held and traded. Doge is more of a currency. Something to stick in your pocket; to give to your family/friends when they need it, or just because you love them; to pay for that book/picture/snapple; to reward that awesome guy dancing in the subway or making an amazing point; to give to anyone and anything in need that you feel is worthy of your money. In that way, Doge has potential to be far more versatile than Bitcoin can ever hope to be (unless Bitcoin just becomes a way to talk in large terms -- the Doge Benjamin of sorts). 


It is this versatility that, to me, ensures Moondom. There is 1.19 trillion in Federal reserve notes in circulation right now. 1.19 trillion for ~314 million people. (and yes, I know that not all the money is circulation is spread only amongst those 314 million but for the love of all things shibe just follow me here). That's enough for everyone in the US to have $3790.00 in their pocket at one time. Each one of those 1.19 trillion dollars is just worth 1 dollar. Nothing more. Nothing less. 


Doge is international. Doge can be the world. It can be ubiquitous and tied to transactions online. An alternate form of payment the likes of which have yet to be defined yet. A stand in for google wallet or paypal that allows you to buy things from the global market place without conversion or confusion. Here are your Dogecoins -- go, give and buy!  


When you think about it in those terms, there are 7 billion people on this planet. Even if only 1 billion. If only 500 million adopt Doge. By January 2015 there should only be about 100 billion Doge in circulation. 


Doge can be big. Doge will be HUGE. Doge will be Moon. But we have to stop thinking of it as a Bitcoin jr. or Altcoin of any sort. Doge needs to be a whole new Shibe, unlike any other. It has to be applied in avenues none other has attempted. Remember when $1 seemed impossible? Me neither.

personalfinance,Tax planning for a university gift?,"My senior year of high school, I was offered a full scholarship to the state university I was dying to attend, but they're notoriously stingy when it comes to financial aid. I'd had my heart set on attending for months, but it wasn't looking financially feasible, especially since smaller private colleges were giving me full tuition scholarships where I'd only have to pay room and board, and my dad, who attended a liberal arts college, was really pushing me in that direction. Thankfully I got a letter in March informing me I was awarded this full scholarship, which made my decision an easy one. I absolutely loved everything about it, and I want to make a substantial gift once I'm able. 

So far I'm thinking either a full scholarship to a student who's interested in my field of study, or a named professorship, which currently require a donation of $1 million. Obviously that's going to be a lot higher once I get to the point of donating, as I'm a 22-year old PhD student (at another university) now. I'm looking to work for the federal government or in private industry, so while I won't be making exorbitant amounts of money, I anticipate a bit more than a typical academic.

Does anyone have experience with structuring a charitable gift to minimize the tax burden? My alma mater's page mentions the ability to donate stocks and bonds, which would seem to have the advantage of avoiding capital gains taxes. At first glance it seems like donating holdings from a traditional TSP or 401k would avoid taxes (besides Medicare and SS) altogether, since contributions are pre-tax and I wouldn't have any income taxes or realized gains. Is this allowed, assuming I'm at the age where I'm allowed to start drawing from the account? Or are there better ways to go about structuring my gift when the time comes? If nothing else I've thought about including it in my will.

I may have a military pension or FERS after 20 or 30 years as a government employee, so that and my Roth IRA would be additional sources of retirement income. Additionally, I don't plan on ""retiring"" after achieving financial independence, as teaching or research is something I'd do even if I had all the money I'd ever need. May take a lower paying job that I find more fulfilling if possible, but as long as I'm in good health I don't plan to quit working.",finance,1392514053

investing,Overview of Current Market Valuations and Toyota Motors (TM),"Hello All,

Every now and then I do stock screens to see if there are any companies that would be a good value investment.  Thanks to the bull market, the opportunities have been few and far between over the last year or two.  However one company has consistently popped up in my screens.  I initially ignored it as the company is in a sector I personally don't like to invest in due to the large capital requirements.  The company is Toyota Motors (TM). 


Simply put, the valuation seems too good to be true.


First off, let me show you what I am talking about.  Here are the heat maps from FinViz:

* [P/E](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_pe_large1600.png)
* [Forward P/E](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_fpe_large1600.png)
* [P/E/G](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_peg_large1600.png)
* [P/BV](http://www.finviz.com/publish/021414/all_pb_large1600.png)

Now as you can see, the general trend of the market is giving you discounts to Financials, Utilities, and Basic Materials, more specifically oil and gold.

Of those sectors, I really only like Financials as big oil has been in a downward trend over the past three years.  Both Exxon and Chevron have produced less oil than the previous years and are both spending at near record high CapEx levels with no turnaround yet. I have continuously looked at both of them as I don't have any oil in my current portfolio, but haven't got myself to buy either of them.  

Financials will continue to be attractive at these levels as investors still don't trust their book values since the financial crisis even though asset quality has continued to improve on a broad base. Over the next 5 years, interest rates will rise which will increase their spread which in turn increases their profitability.

For the most part, it appears healthcare, consumer goods, and services are currently overvalued.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's look at Toyota.  Below is a quick multiples valuation against TM's peers.  These are from Yahoo! Finance as GM isn't on FinViz for some reason.

P/E

* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **7.81**
* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 10.87
* General Motors Co. (GM): 15.11
* Ford Motor Co. (F): 8.65

Forward P/E

* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **9.11**
* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 9.30
* General Motors Co. (GM): 7.35
* Ford Motor Co. (F): 7.90

P/E/G

* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **0.29(!)**
* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 0.37
* General Motors Co. (GM): 0.52 
* Ford Motor Co. (F): 0.97

P/BV

* Toyota Motor Co. (TM): **1.02**
* Honda Motor Co. (HMC): 0.91
* General Motors Co. (GM): 1.34
* Ford Motor Co. (F): 2.91

As you can see, the whole sector looks cheap on a multiples basis, but of that bunch Toyota seems to win out on an overall valuation based on multiples.  

*Per my own investing rules, as I am a long term shareholder, I won't touch a company that has recently been bankrupt, therefore I rule out GM for any potential investments.*

Now Toyota is too big of a company to do a full report on in a couple of days.  However, of what little research I have done, this is what I have found.

First of all, on a macro perspective, the yen has weakened against both the US Dollar and the Chinese Yuan. Over the past two years, the Dollar and Yuan have both gained over 30% to the yen and over 10% this past year.  This is a great thing for a Japanese multinational as North America and Asia is TM's second and third largest markets which combined are 46% of 2013's sales.  

* [USD/JPY](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=USDJPY%3DX+Interactive#symbol=;range=2y;compare=;indicator=volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=;)
* [CNY/JPY](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=CNYJPY%3DX+Interactive#symbol=CNYJPY=X;range=2y)

Because of this, profitability should be higher within Toyota which is also a reason to buy them over GM or Ford as the american automakers will lose money with a strong dollar overseas.

Over the past three years, TM has a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.12%.  Last year, North America saw 32.8% sales growth and Asia saw 30.22% sales growth.  This compounded with the yen weakening is a one-two punch.

Due to the strong demand in both North America and Asia, Toyota has had a surge in Consolidated Net Income for Fiscal Year 2014 of 135% in which ForEx is responsible for 123% of that growth alone. In this latest quarter, Net Revenues are up 23.9% with Net Income up 118%. 

[Toyota's Shareholder Presentation](http://www.toyota-global.com/investors/financial_result/2014/pdf/q3/presentation.pdf)

Margins have increased across the board with their Gross Profit increasing from last year:

TM's Gross Profit Margin

* 2013: 15.51%
* 2012: 11.81%
* 2011: 12.52%

As for a quick look at the balance sheet, Toyota has been de-leveraging over the past 5 years with Total Debt / Equity of 1.25 in 2009 to 1.16 in 2013.  Book Value per Share has stayed relatively flat but grew 15.14% from 2012 to 2013.   Compare that to a one year increase in share price of only 12.25% I believe we have a winner.

This is only what I have found off of a couple hours looking at this tonight and have only scratched the surface as to the information on this company.

However after just a small amount of research I firmly believe this is a truly undervalued company and should be bought right away.

I should state that this is just beginning due diligence and there are several assumptions with this thesis, mainly that the Yen will stay depressed at least over the next year.

dogecoin,Can we sustain if Doge value does not rise over time?,"I've been pondering about this in the back of my mind for a while now, and the fedora call for help rekindled the idea: what if Doge value stays on it's current level over time?
please correct me if I'm wrong, but if I understand it correctly, all miners combined supply the processing power to process and confirm transactions. In return, miners receive coins as payment. 
Say that the amount of miners stays the same for a certain amount of time. But with every halving, the amount of coins received for the same amount of processing power diminishes. This means the cost of running pc's, mining rigs, laptops or even asics will be larger than the revenues in doge. At that moment, miners will stop because this is costing them money. (Maybe not all shibes here, but definitely a majority of the ones that are in it for money only) This will result in a less powerful blockchain, with slower transaction confirmations and a greater risk of 51% attacks.
once we're there, I see a downward spiral because the slower confirmations will further decrease value, which will force out more miners, etc.
Is this a real acenario, or am I overlooking something that is in place to prevent just this from happening?

2) Be critical, what can I do better? Your constructive advice if you were in my shoes?

3) Am I missing something bigger? With two parents who had financial problems I have recently been reflecting that my personal finances are rather influenced by an extreme desire for financial independence and not to repeat mistakes I see in my parents. My worry is that this mentality has come at the expense of relationships with friends and significant others. It has been a long time since a meaningful relationship and I want to change this. Is there a world in which I can stop putting finances as an absolute first? Can you share some personal stories?

4) I'd like to upgrade my housing, currently subletting a small room from a family. Do I have room in the budget to upgrade to some more expensive housing ($2000/mo+)?

5) Would like to explore further education. Company may fund some if I continue working full time. Are loans okay to fund the remainder?

personalfinance,Pay down student debt vs. Start saving?,Hey everyone - I finished university in the summer and have about 25k is student debt  (I'm Canadian) at a 4% interest rate. Since graduating I've basically been living paycheck to paycheck and am about to start a full time job where I will be more comfortable financially and can start paying the debt down. I don't have any savings really though and am wondering how I should prioritise paying down debt/building savings. I likely won't be able to get debt at that interest rate for quite a while so I'm leaning towards continuing to make the minimum payment and putting away at least 6 months of expenses in a low volatility etf. Does that make sense? If so what kind of etf should I look at? Any other thoughts? Thanks for the help in advanced!,finance,1392569840

Is there a loan that would allow something like that? After buying my home originally I found out about ""purchase &amp; renovate"" loans, so I figured I'd better ask, although I haven't seen any ""refinance &amp; renovate"" loans, so I thought there might be a different word for it.

Also, I am basing my estimations on what I could get for a home equity loan from the appraisal I got done when I purchased the home 5 years ago. I assume the bank is going to need a new appraisal. Is there anything I can do to help that number go up, or is it purely market-driven?

My other option besides a home equity loan is to refinance, cutting my mortgage payment to less than half what I'm paying now, and saving &amp; using the extra money to pay for the projects, but I'd really like to have the larger amount in hand, to get it done and pay for the unexpected things that come up when fixing up a house that's 90-some years old.",finance,1392581112

personalfinance,What calculation will help me decide whether to aggressively pay down a 1.5% APR income contingent loan? (with bonus currency conversion complication),"I have an income contingent student loan of £12,000 (roughly $20k) at 1.5% APR (although that fluctuates on a yearly basis according to the action of magical economic pixies I do not understand), that currently requires a minimum monthly payment of around $100 - this is approximate due to the exchange rate: it's a british loan but I live in the US so I'm paying it off with dollars. 

I have no other debt, strong credit, and a healthy emergency fund, but retirement savings are almost nil and I'm in my mid-30s with 1 child. 

It seems like I should just continue to make the minimum payment because it is such a low rate, but this is based on a funny feeling in my big toe rather than a sensible, rational calculation. Loitering around PF has led me to believe I should be maxing out a 401k and Roth IRA before I consider throwing extra at this loan, but the fluctuating exchange rate means there will always be a better and a worse time to clear it. Seems like the answer should be obvious but I don't have the financial literacy to justify it.

Despite being pretty handy with Excel, I can't figure out what calculation I should be doing to figure out whether I need to clear this thing as soon as possible. It will be forgiven when I'm 65 if I haven't paid it off by then, although at that minimum payment I should have it done in 20 years. 

How would you go about making this decision? I'm more interested in the decision process than just the ultimate answer, if that makes sense.

Bitcoin,Will Bitcoin truly be deflationary: Question for any trained economists,"*Before we start, I'm not talking about right now while new BTC are still being generated at roughly 10%p.a.*

One of the most convincing arguments I've heard against Bitcoin as a currency vs. payment technology is that it is deflationary and therefore widespread adoption would dampen economic growth. It's fairly orthodox monetary theory and makes a huge amount of sense. Instead, most major economies central banks use inflation targeting (incl. recently the Federal Reserve) to link money supply to economic growth.  

**But is Bitcoin actually deflationary VS. today's interest rate system?** 

Let's assume:

* It's 2150 when the Bitcoin money supply is effectively static

* Bitcoins are now mainstream and hold a steady share of global transactions (say 10%)

As the global economy grows, bitcoin price should grow in line...so if global economic growth was 3%p.a. in USD terms, bitcoin price would increase by roughly 3%p.a. (or prices would fall by 2.9%), hence the cited deflationary effect.

My questions are:

* **How is the increase in value of bitcoin different to the interest rates I get for saving fiat currency?** Wouldn't both act as dampeners on spending?

* **If they are the *effectively* same, then doesn't the value of bitcoin auto-correct to economic needs?** I.e. in a recession bitcoin would inflate (price decrease over time) to encourage spending, while in periods of economic growth bitcoins would deflate to reign in investment

* **Does this mean that in practice Bitcoin replaces interest rate with price as the key ""lever"" of monetary policy?**

* **Would this scenario change if Bitcoins completely replaced all fiat currency?**


P.S. I know there are ideological subsets of Bitcoiners and I'm really not interested in hearing from the crowd going ""central bankers = evil"". I love the Bitcoin technology and have a fairly sizeable investment, but I also believe the central bank approach to monetary policy is usually responsible.",cryptocurrency,1392633707

Maxing Roth 401k for me  
Have taxable account that is 60/40 stocks and tax exempt municipal bonds  
Wife will have a pension after 30 years of service  
Firmly in the 15% tax bracket currently
  
I have been making Roth 401k contributions because of my wife's eventual pension that will eat the lower tax brackets upon retirement.  Also a likely windfall may mean that our retirement tax bracket will possibly be higher than our current 15% anyway.  
  
Also due to our 15% tax bracket I plan to start performing tax gain harvesting of the stocks in our taxable account since we will pay no federal capital gains on them.  It's a bit trickier since we live in Tennessee and in order to escape the state Hall Tax on capital gains we have to have less than $2500 in capital gains and dividends for joint filers, but that's a whole other mess.  
  
I have some ""room"" in the 15% tax bracket currently, but down the line I foresee that as our incomes increase that we will eventually start running out of room, especially with doing Roth contributions to 401k.  
  
My questions are thus:  
  
Am I correct in thinking this is the amount of room I have in the 15% tax bracket (in 2013 numbers to make it easy):  72500 + 12200 (standard deduction) + 3900 exemption (me) + 3900 exemption (wife) + 3900 exemption (daughter) + 1000 (child tax credit) = $97400?  As long as our gross income is below this we are 15% right?
  
Secondly, is the benefit of staying completely in the 15% tax bracket or lower to maintain tax free capital gains status worth backing off of Roth contributions and going Traditional when we get to that point to effectively get us back to the 15% tax bracket?  Even given the pension?

* On one hand, I want to pay off my car, since it's the highest interest rate and if I need to sell it in a pinch for whatever reason that money will go to me rather than the bank
* On the other hand, I just want to chip away at as much of this $65K in student debt as possible, since to my understanding you cannot be absolved from student debt even if you go bankrupt.
* On the other other hand, perhaps I should invest? As Tesla breaks $200 last week I'm kicking myself in the ass for not buying as much of it as I could when I wanted to at $50/share last year.
* Forth, put a chunk into my IRA. I'm a contract worker and get 0 benefits, so I haven't made a contribution to my retirement in a while.
* Final option is to simply sit on the money. Play it safe, hold on to it as a rainy-day-fund in case my contract doesn't get extended (the IT job market in this city is pretty shit if I were to become unemployed).",finance,1392646067
dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 41 - Integrity: Why It Matters Now More Than Ever,"Hey all! GoodShibe here!

There's a lot of romanticism about the notions of 'Good' and 'Evil'.  That somehow good and bad people 'just are'.  You're either born good or born bad and that's the game, folks.  

But the harder, more realistic way to look at it is that life is full of choices.  And sometimes you make good ones and sometimes you make bad ones - but it's the culmination of those choices, and their ramifications, that mold you.  

The decisions you make with the choices offered.

Being 'good' when the only options are 'do good' and 'do nothing', that's admirable.

But 'Integrity' is built in the fires of *being able* to make the wrong choice, being tempted, but choosing not to.  Consistently.  Choosing to have your word mean something.  Choosing to stand for something other than your own personal gain.  Having a backbone when it matters most and not being afraid to do the right thing, even if it hurts.

Sadly, integrity is also one of the first things that tends to go when one enters a realm of very little consequence.

The internet, on its own, bestowed upon us a thrilling rush of wearing a mask in public without leaving our seats; that idea that no one could know who you are but you're still out there, you're interacting.  And, unless you're really skilled, there's not really much of a way to peek under that mask.

I remember when I first got on the internet, oh so long ago - old enough to appreciate what it was, what I was seeing, but young enough to be caught up in a whole lot of foolishness.  Fun, sure, but the thrill and freedom that came from being another face in the crowd, well sometimes that siren call was too good to pass up.  I remember Habbo raids and other insane nights on 4Chan - doing stupid things because they were fun and little else.  Nothing harmful, but mindless fun nonetheless.  Basking in the sort of freedom that you could only find online.

Over time it's become easier and easier to peek under that mask, and, for some, that knowledge keeps them on the straight and narrow.  

For some, it just means finding a better mask.

Unfortunately, for those folks, the idea of cryptocurrencies allows them to play out a host of other fantasies; take part in a world they may have missed the boat on when the Internet was new.

To lie without fear of being caught.

To take that which was not freely given.

To harm others without fear of reprisal.

And sometimes, for the rest of us, we don't realize how important integrity is until we've been burnt by those without it.

For me, I've been scammed more than a few times online, and there's a certain empathy it builds within, if you let it.  It's one of the reasons I jumped at the chance to be a mod on /r/dogecoinscamwatch.  If you know that pain, truly know it, then you know that you would wish it on no other soul. 

And in that way, Integrity has a way of sneaking up on you - realizing that looking out for others, keeping them from feeling the way you felt, is its own reward.  

Watching that desire grow into a need to have an impact, that being known for doing what you say you will is an important thing; evolving that need into an awareness -- that *being* that kind of person, even striving to be that kind of person, makes you a rare commodity in a sea of nameless faces.  

A solid rock in a flowing stream of data.  

Someone to be counted on, when it matters.

And we need people with Integrity now, more than ever.

Because, just like the internet once was, our Dogecoin - heck, cryptocurrency as a whole - is yet a wailing babe in a basket.  Largely defenseless, ripe for the picking if its minders aren't careful.  

We've yet to discover ways of protecting ourselves while ensuring we, and our core values, the things that make us special, remain unscathed.

And that's why I'm chuffed as all heck when I see interviews like this one, from our Founder, /u/ummjackson:

“[I turned down Half A Million Dollars.  Because F*** that](http://www.techly.com.au/2014/02/17/dogecoin-founder-turned-half-million-dollars-f/)”

And users like /u/NeutralityMentality [stepping up to kick in 14 Million DOGE](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1y3q4z/save_dogemas_update_brian_keeper_of_the_funds_is/cfhbumh?context=3) to put to rest any lingering fears about SaveDogemas.

Being able to make the wrong choice, choosing not to.  That's the future.  

As we work to redefine our global community, it will be leaders like them who will be the signposts along the way.  Our beacons in the dark.  Showing us a better way, inspiring others to make the right choices, consistently, as well.

Not because we have to, but because we want to.  

Because our names - whether you're a Jackson or a Jane or a 'RocketDawg1191' - *matter to us*.

It's not about Good or Evil.  It's about choice.

And as long as we choose to be better, to make the right choices not just when 'it counts' but to aspire towards having -- and inspiring -- Integrity, then we won't need a rocket.

We'll be bringing the moon to us.

It's 9:26AM EST and we're at 51.96% of DOGEs found.  Our network is currently going through a fork - please do not transfer any DOGEs or mine, just yet.  Due to this stall, our Global Hashrate has fallen to ~32 Gigahashes per second from ~72 and our Difficulty has dropped to ~1002.

It looks like some pools have not been mining using an updated wallet which has caused our Blockchain to split, possibly several times.  

This is being sorted out right now.  The DOGEs you currently have are not in danger, just don't send them out into the yard to play until this gets sorted (or there's a good chance they'll be lost).

Keep an eye on the sub for updates as they happen.

**EDIT**: Looks like the fork has been resolved! Great work, all involved!  Thank you!

As always, I appreciate your support,

GoodShibe

TL;DR: Building Integrity is about making the right choices, consistently, when you have the option to make wrong ones.  Putting the needs of others before your own. And having Integrity, in the still-infant world of Dogecoin, is an important step forward for us all.  We need it now, more than ever.",cryptocurrency,1392648012
dogecoin,(SRS) DOGE: Currency or Commodity or Both,"So is our beloved coin destined to be tipping coin for micro transactions only or will it appreciate and carry greater monetary value? There are two distinct trains of thought on its future and best use backed by two distinct camps of shibe. The dogecoin founders have, through word and monetary policy, indicated their intentions for the coin and many pups agree. That outcome would come as an immense disappointment to the second camp, the shibes that are hoping that their faith in the coin is rewarded with ride to the moon, an appreciable increase in the per coin price. A possible third outcome begs the question: is it possible to have a coin worth say $100 each and still be used effectively for tipping, maybe tipping in 1/100 or 1/1000 fractions of a coin?

personalfinance,Can / Should I Have my Employer Directly Pay Off Student Loans,"Hey Ya'll,

I'm going to be graduating with my MBA this June and I have a (I think) a unique question about how to best pay down my student loan debt. I haven't been able to find anything that has touched on this, so I apologize in advance if this has already been covered.

I have an offer on the table that I am 95% sure I'm going to go with. I it is in a position that I want, and in a field that is growing and interesting to me; plus, the compensation is quite good. 

**The compensation package**: 80k base pay; 20% profit sharing in all post-reinvested company funds (they take 50% of our company's profits and reinvest them in the firm), 6% equity stake. No employer match for savings plans. I put together a model, and taking all of these factors into account, It is safe to assume I'll make over 100k, but it will all come in the form of quarterly and year-end bonuses.

The firm that offered me this is on the smaller side, ~12 people. When we were discussing their offer they mentioned they have a food plan of sorts where you can take out up to 5k from your salary and have the company cover the costs up to 5k. My understanding of this is that since the company covers the cost, I will have the full 5k to use towards buying food / going out than if I were to just keep that 5k in my base salary, I would essentially only have 5k less federal income tax less state income tax. Is that correct? Am I even making sense here?

To that end, I was wondering if I could take this same idea and have the employer directly pay off my student loan debt. Ideally, I'd have them take 30k of my salary and pay down my student loan debt as opposed to paying me, getting taxed, and paying in substantially smaller installments.

So my questions to ya'll are: 1) Is this possible, 2) Is this legal, 3) Is this smart, 4) Is there something I've missed or should consider?

I have already run the numbers on living in my city with 50k and it will be pretty doable (finding a take-home pay calculator that makes sense seems damn near impossible... my net take home shouldn't be 2982, I think) at 50k. I'll likely have around 200 - 300 in disposable income at the end of each month that I could use to make payments towards loans, savings accounts, etc.

I do understand my debt is significantly smaller than most others on this sub, but either way I feel like was the best place for these questions.  Being young and stupid, I made very poor choices financially such as attending a trade school for a worthless degree, getting a car loan with an interest rate so high that would make your asshole pucker, and my more immediate dilemma is having absolutely no savings. 
• My car purchase price was 9700, I financed 12,600- at a 21.36% INTEREST! (I don't need someone telling me I am totally stupid for this, I get reminded on the 21st of every month. -_-) 
• I have ~25k in student loans, all in deferment except for one. They are not consolidated and I have 6, the rates range from 2.9-6.8.
• I put a small amount in my newly started saving account on my last pay day.  Just to start something. 
I have never budgeted before and am looking for tools to do so, the best I've found was through my banks tools so far. Also I'd like to refinance my car, for obvious reasons but that is proving to be much more difficult than I planned because of my DTI. Which is a whopping 42%! As of two weeks ago.  I really would like to be able to get some debts paid off, but wondering if I should pay on the smaller student loans just to get those paid off and less lines of credit or consolidate and make monthly arrangements. Or if I should just put every extra penny I have towards my car and the little bit I can and savings. Any advice is greatly appreciated, I very obviously have never done any budgeting in my entire life and sadly now that I am 22 and out on my own I am learning way behind the power curve...

personalfinance,"Student with $1500 in debt but lots of confusing assets, need major help picking a loan (very long post)","Hello personal finance, thank you for reading my complex, confused plea.  

I am a phd student in an income-tax free state. I make approximately $1000 a month teaching 20 hours a week and have a recruitment fellowship that pays 18k over the course of 10 months. I am not allowed to have an outside job or I will lose my funding. My fellowship ends this May and for the next year I will only make around $1500 a month. I do not pay tuition and have health benefits (no dental) as a part of my package. I do not know what I will have to pay for 2013 regarding taxes re: my scholarship, but I have a meeting with a ""grad tax helper"" from my college next week.

I independently own two homes; one condo appraised at 220k and one home at 150k. They are both paid in full. The condo is being rented to someone who covers the property taxes and the condo fees. I rent a room out of the home I live in to help shoulder the costs of maintaining it. The home I live in is a 50 year old house and it needed work (new insulation, new AC, etc.) Therefore, I have put the majority of my scholarship and salary into my home and moving myself across the country from my original state. I am carrying around $1500 in credit card debt for expenses on the home and a loan from my city on the property taxes (which will be subsidized somewhat next year per the homestead act which I qualify for)

My 150k appraised home has a small, 50 year old pool in the backyard. The pool needs to be re-plastered relatively soon because of a water issue. The re-plastering has a job bid of $4800-$6800 depending on the condition of the pool shell underneath (long story short it had a fiberglass shell put in on top of the pool and this is bad news bears- it needs to come out). I don't have the money to complete this project without selling my car (which I can't do because I commute) and I can't just up my renters' fees to squirrel away money bit by bit as the renters are locked in to a contract until August. 

To make things more complex, I would love to sell my condo and use some of that capital to ease my life, but it is in an area of very stagnant growth; condos in the building take an average of two years to sell because it is a university town and everyone of ""condo age"" rents because of the frigid real estate market. Even if I wanted to sell the condo to pay for the pool, it wouldn't happen in time. (The rust belt is dying, my friends… )

Because my assets are non-liquid, I would like to get a loan to float the pool project or even perhaps the next year to help relieve the limitations of a $1000ish/mo. salary. I can't cram anymore roommates in my house and I am renting both properties at fair market value. I filled out a FAFSA to see if I quality for a federal loan, but I doubt I will as a graduate student and I won't find out until April or so if I could qualify. The pool needs fixing ASAP. 

I feel really lost and I don't even know where to start. Without judgement or reprimanding me for the choices I have made thus far- I'm asking for some advice going forward. What would you do if you were me? 

TL;DR- I have 300k+ in nonliquid assets and need $6000ish immediately for a repair but I am a student and have little to no income and am carrying $1500 in credit card debt and a city loan. How can I pay for this considering it will take me a year or two to unload some of my assets into cash?

Bitcoin,We have an information dissemination problem.,"Specifically referencing [this post from 2 weeks ago,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1wwdt6/who_is_the_most_well_informed_and_articulate/) and [this post from 2 days ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1xyrj6/one_of_the_flaws_of_decentralization_is_a_shitty/)

Essentially, it seems as if anyone who says ""here are some of the problems with Bitcoin"" are either arguing from a position of lack of information (pyramid scheme, etc.), from misconceptions (volatility, etc.), or are arguing against a concept rather than bitcoin itself (deflationary vs inflationary currencies). 

I know someone who actually thinks less of me because I have skin in the game. I attempted to address some of his concerns, but was cut off before I could finish, pretty much because the very idea is too asinine to him. ""Bitcoin is a fad,"" and so on. And this is an individual who claims to have done some research on bitcoin, including reading this subreddit.

I think we have a bit of a problem. Basically, the only people who are willing to do the work necessarily to understand what their talking about when it comes to bitcoin are people who are receptive to the idea. People like to compare bitcoin to mp3s or other technologies that started out slowly but eventually picked up steam and entered the mainstream.

The difference is, people heard about mp3s as music they could download and listen to without having to go to a store, or dealing with the music skipping while they jog.

With bitcoin? A lot of people's first exposure was ""Whoa, check out how you can buy drugs online!"" And that pretty much set the tone for bitcoin in the minds of the masses, for years. Anyone reading that dismissed it as internet drug money. It was introduced on [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/06/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable/) (arguably the first big article about bitcoin) as an ""untraceable digital currency."" Nevermind the fact that not all bitcoiners buy drugs.

The next big thing (or things) is articles about large bitcoin thefts, or sudden market movements ""Whoa, bitcoin just got hacked!"" ""Whoa, bitcoin just crashed!"" Nevermind the fact that the ""hacks"" were more like digital bank robbery by exchanges with bad technical practices, or the fact that bitcoin has, historically, always bounced back stronger after a small crash. 

We have the ""What is Bitcoin?"" video, which has over 5 million views on YouTube, but look at the comments. It's full FUD and people asking practical questions. A *lot* of practical questions. Questions that a 1 minute, 44 second video prompts, but doesn't answer. 

I see videos of Andreas talking about bitcoin for one, two, three hours. And I see people complaining about the length of those talks. The Joe Rogan Experience is probably currently the single, best introduction to Bitcoin out there in terms of being spoonfed damn near everything you want to know in a somewhat-easily understood way. But you have to sit and listen to it for 3 hours. 

And we live in a society that has grown used to seven-second video clips. Anything longer than a minute or two is way too long of a commitment.

tl;dr: I don't really have a tl;dr for this. Most people who hear about bitcoin dismiss it because they think it's purpose-built, and that the purposes are evil/illegal. Or because they were exposed to it through someone with a far-reaching mouth, but who is also misinformed, so the introduction was laced with all types of FUD. ""Bitcoin is this thing that is bad because of this thing that isn't actually true."" ""Oh, well then hello and goodbye, bitcoin.""

Almost every person in my life who feels positive about bitcoin is a programmer or is otherwise technologically savvy (way more than most). Almost all of *those* people have adopted a ""wait-and-see"" view, despite their optimism. I know three people out of several who have skin in the game one way or another. Two of them are programmers who built rigs. One of them got lucky, receiving a BFL ASIC preorder just before BTC skyrocketed past $.1/mBTC last year.

**Bitcoin has a very steep learning curve.** Until we can adequately inform people about it quickly, I think that is the message we need to send. I think we should encourage people not to accept anything less than at least a modicum of commitment to understanding, rather than one of the little sound bytes you'll hear on the news. Otherwise, we end up with the blind leading the blind.",cryptocurrency,1392676924

(USA)","So, I received an offer from a new company for pretty much 60% more than my current salary (74k to 110k + 10k end of year bonus assuming I don't screw up). However, this is an unusual company, as it's owned by two guys who contract out 80% of the work. I'll be working from home most of the time as they don't have a place of business, really, for me to work in (and I'm not complaining, since my current commute is 3+hours round trip). I also have the option of using my own equipment if I prefer (and I greatly do, for a lot of reasons I'd rather not go into).

I have a few questions:

1) Even though I'm a W2 employee with full benefits, can I still write off work-related expenses, such as a new laptop I'll be purchasing, and the software related to this as well?

2) They don't offer a 401(k). Obviously, I'll be tossing the max possible in a traditional IRA. Since I live pretty comfortably on 50k (pretax) now (aside from the fact that I am a very, very unlucky person (I had almost 15k in unexpected health, pet, car, and housing costs last year!) (This year I'm already up to 7k, I think I beat last year's record!)), where else should I start stuffing money to retire as early as possible? I'm not looking to purchase a house any time soon. Renting is enough for me at the moment, since knowing my luck, the house will catch fire the day after I move in and my insurance won't cover fires caused by ficus trees or something.

3) I owe 200ish in federal taxes for the 2013 year, is there anything I can do this year to reduce it? From my understanding, since I made ~70k last year, I'm not eligible for a traditional IRA deduction since my previous employer offered a 401(k). Just curious.

4) As a point to above, I was working with my new company for a few months as an independent contractor (and will be for the next two weeks as well). Does this mean I should purchase the stuff now in order to get the tax deductions, assuming the answer to 1) is no?

5) I started doing independent contracting in December, but didn't get paid until Jan. Does that mean that I have to mark the income from contracting on my 2013 or 2014 taxes?

Bitcoin,My view on the future of Bitcoin (I have a degree in Math &amp; Economics),"Much has been learned in the last 50 years about “money / currency”. The goal presumably to find out what the best possible money is, then adopt it. The choices made deciding our monetary policy should be a matter of political debate. This debate though has largely been out of the public eye. 

One needs to realize that the type of money used by a civilization has direct consequences on the distribution of wealth, the distribution of real physical resources, and the distribution of power. How money flows through the system results in how goods &amp; services flow. Bottlenecks and distortions in the flow of money result in distortions of the real economy.

It is generally agreed that the most recent financial collapse was caused by financial distortions. Hundreds of billions of dollars lent out against personal housing assets that were overpriced, then resold at a profit as “AAA securities”. Any repercussion for the rating agency which confirmed that rating? Any inherent moral hazard caused by the link between rating agencies, and the banks issuing the securities?

Since this crisis began SIX YEARS ago, governments have been acquiring real assets by drawing on an empty but limitless bank account. The government does not even need to incur the expense of actually printing money to create billions of dollars of bank credit (that can be distributed to bank shareholders). Central banks have changed their official role from maintaining a fixed, counterfeit free supply to actively trying to manipulate the economy through monetary policy. Governments have targeted inflation in a period of natural deflation (by natural deflation I am referring to the natural process of prices decreasing because of better technology, better economies of scale, and higher productivity). Because of pressures of natural deflation central banks have been in constant monetary expansion. No other globally traded asset has decreased in value more consistently than fiat money. 

Government manipulations distort the economy. Several results, some more visible in one economy compared to another: 
1. The effect of monetary policy in China has been to funnel credit primarily to government owned enterprises and government friendly businesses at the expense of other actors in the Chinese economy, strengthening the control of the communist party. 
2. In much of the western world (Canada, US, Britain most visibly), easy money policy increased house prices drastically. The ratio of wages to rents has been steadily decreasing, which reduces disposable income for the majority of households (consumer spending could be affected which could affect the broader economy negatively)
3. Japan has been in a debt crisis for 20 years. The main benefactors of ‘Abenomics’ are holders of the Japanese equity market; including many large foreign investors.  

Our economy is experiencing financialization, which is a systematic exploitation of the monetary system to move wealth from the productive economy to the financial economy. In the past thirty years we have seen: 
1. An increase in the size of the financial industry with respect to all other economic activity. Rising efficiency should have had the opposite effect on the industry. 
2. An increase in the role of financial controllers in the management of corporations. 
3. An increase in the percentage of financial assets in all tradable assets.
4. An increase in the perception that stock market fluctuation are a determinant of the business cycle.  

We must ask ourselves: ‘will the nation continue to be the most influential actor on the flows of commerce?’ Nations limit trade, limit international cooperation, and create adversarial incentives. Politicians have been spouting about free trade for a generation, but ‘free trade agreements’ are complex laws designed to protect the interests of large corporations and industries. Bitcoin is an outlet for consumers and small businesses to connect globally with zero friction. Trust is placed in an online network that is the result of a scientific breakthrough in mathematical security that cannot be interrupted by outside forces.

Today 1% of that market costs 96million. In July of 2009, the United States paid more than $19 billion in interest on the public debt. 

The first step is to recognize that national paper money and fractional reserve banking are human institutions, they were built on the ideas, politics and technology of last century. They can and will change over time.  They should change now. A de-centralized monetary system is more democratic and will put different pressures on society and lead to different results. A monetary system that puts more value on resources in the future (deflationary) will result in a society more willing to conserve. A monetary system that is equal across all nations will encourage reflection on the wealth inequality between nations and encourage international charity, international remittances and the support of small businesses selling their goods internationally. 

Bitcoin is the first mover in the market and there is no reason to believe that Bitcoin will not be a leader over the next decade because the growth of this market has inherent positive feed-back loops. As the market grows in size the developers who believe in the durability of Bitcoin in the long term have more funds, and time to invest in technological improvements. This investment will happen on two fronts.  The protocol will likely see an update that addresses malleability of transactions, and the scalability of the blockchain. These updates are being done by well educated experienced experts with extreme focus on the security and stability of the release. There will not be a Bitcoin protocol release analogous to the Obamacare website launch. The second front of Bitcoin development is built using the blockchain to establish trust. Several companies have made breakthroughs into the online payment system market, and a lot of work is being done to ease the usability and security of Bitcoin wallets (Electrum is my recommendation to you! bitcoin.org → resources → wallets → Electrum). Services that create contracts (ownership) between investors &amp; savers will be provable on the blockchain. Bitcoin can also be the vehicle to create contracts (m of n addresses) that create a very secure escrow.

TL:DR
Do not let short term market speculation by people who do not believe in the long term use of Bitcoin disrupt the development of this technology.",cryptocurrency,1392683888
personalfinance,"25, single, need help with savings, budgeting &amp; investments (USish)","I am 25 and still living at home.  I pay for between 1/3 and 1/2 of household expenses (rent, utilities, food, etc). 

Despite the fact my education situation has been rocky – I have found a good opportunity at a public sector job in a US Territory.  Because of that I need to mention that our cost of living is slightly different than the mainland US.  I work in middle management in a technical field currently making $32,000 per year before taxes.  To provide some perspective, my father makes about $5,000 less than me as a local educator.  There is no federal income tax here, we only pay into FICA (7.65%), local tax (4%-10% depending on salary level) and a local “2% wage tax”. 

Before taxes on a monthly basis I make $2,461.54, after taxes it is $1,840.25.  I have an issue with my W-4 and for some reason I am taking out 15.59% for local taxes.  I figure since the max level is 10%, I should be taking out about 10%.   Currently the total amount I am taxed is 25.24%  I believe I can get this amount down to 19.65% by adjusting that W-4, I plan on doing that in the coming weeks. 
At $32,000 per year, I am currently paying a total of $8,077 in taxes.  Which leaves me with an estimated take home of $23,923 per year.  I have calculated my monthly expenses to be around $1,000 per month, which should leave me with a bit under $12,000 per year.  

The biggest issue I have is with budgeting and saving.  I have had this job for several years and I am kicking myself at the fact that I should have close to $30k in savings, but I’ve failed to really pay attention to tightening my expenses up. 

My goal with this post is to get some pointers on a few things: 

1)	Budgeting  -- I currently use Mint.com but it isn’t as effective as I would like it to be, because plastic/transactions are difficult to track/handle here. 

2)	Savings Accounts – personal methods to deal with putting things away for savings.  Currently I have a FCU account for savings, it’s physically very far away from me.  I had to dip into it a few months ago and never paid back into it.  To get cash in or out I have to use Dwolla, Paypay or Western Union (out only).  I like this, because it keeps it safe. 

3)	I have two savings jars currently.  I found something in a subreddit (could have been this one).  I put away a $ amount equal to the week.  This should give me around $1,378 by the end of the year.  I make it a rule to put in any unused cash as well in my wallet, $1s, $5s.  by the end of the week.   I also put all of my spare change into a jar. 

4)	I have a prepaid credit card with BOA.  It took me 5 years of trying to get a card to finally get one.   There is $400 on it, whenever I use it, I try to immediately pay it off in whole or in part.  This allowed me to finally get a credit score, which is 688.  It is on the lower end because of the length of my credit history. 

5)	Investments – I would like to figure out how to handle investments better.  I know there are some entry level options out there, some direction would be great. 

6)	IRA?  Should I bother or should I wait until I have 15/20k to toss into one? 

7)	Loans?  I would like to look at getting a small loan.  I have a bit of a situation currently, My car is about ready to kick the bucket.  Collectively we’re putting about a car payment worth of repairs into our current car on a monthly basis (this has been going  for two months).  I’ve told my parents I’m no longer interested in repairing the car (for the reasons stated above) we’re all in agreement that we’re going to sell it as is, for about $500-600.  I’d like to get a small loan to cover the cost of a used car for transportation, my parents make enough to cost share this project and I don’t think it will negatively impact my current expenditures.   All I can do out of this is better my credit score, as long as everyone makes payments on time.   I will be sure to have enough money set aside to cover at least two of their payments at any given time to avoid getting myself into a situation in the event they miss a payment.",finance,1392684859

I am a 22 year old fully employed military officer and currently I am maxing my Roth IRA and Roth TSP. Pretty soon I will be above the income limits for the Roth IRA so will have to do backdoor contributions or something else. Also I have a STEM degree so I see myself having a higher paying job (i.e. higher tax bracket) when I leave the military hopefully with 20 years in for the retirement plan.

My questions are:

1. Should I start investing in the Traditional TSP and or a Traditional IRA to diversify when I am taxed. Or should I start investing elsewhere in an individual brokerage account so I have money that wont be tied to me turning 59 1/2.

2. Are backdoor contributions to an IRA really that much of a hassle or are they definitely the way to go if I anticipate being in a higher tax bracket at retirement?

here is the question for context:

Your loan was a 48-month fixed rate loan at a stated rate of 6% per year.You paid a non-refundable application fee of $100 at that time in cash. Interest rates have fallen during the last two years and a new bank now offers to refinance your car by lending you the balance due at a stated rate of 4% per year. You will use the proceeds of this loan to pay off the old loan. Suppose the new loan requires a $200 non-refundable application fee. Given all this information, should you refinance?

Bitcoin,"bitcoinvanity.appspot.com is not secure, and possibly a scam.","Oh the blessings and curses of irreversible transactions. I'll be honest - this one stings a bit.

**I have some pretty damning circumstantial evidence that bitcoinvanity.appspot.com is skimming the private keys of their users, and transferring away Bitcoin from those who create addresses on their service.**

Here's the sequence of events:

1) Over the weekend, I decided I wanted to create some vanity BTC addresses for myself and family (because, hey, if those 1Enjoy 1Sochi bitspammers get one, why not me?).

2) Of the several addresses I created, on of them was a goof account (1FartsVaXCqT8MAJxAjTwrfz3UAXqVKbCh).

3) I imported the vanity addresses into my hot-wallet on Blockchain.info.

4) I swept an old, non-vanity address where I kept change from purchases into the new vanity address

5) I messaged a buddy of mine, joking that I was going to bitspam the world with 1Enjoy 1Farts, and showed him the address.

6) He replied back ""Whoa, looks like there was once 2.36244159 BTC in there.""

7) As soon as I see it, my stomach sinks, because that BTC should not be in the past tense.

8) I log into Blockchain.info, and notice that the BTC is 8 confirmations away from a wallet address I control, having been transferred to 1JMPsVyyCrLt8xRSiBypG6JKawsUVTGjKy.

**I rang up my aforementioned buddy (a BTC veteran) diagnosed the possibilities:**

1) My blockchain.info account has been compromised. I determine this to be unlikely, since only the contents of that vanity address have been swept, not the entire wallet.

2) Blockchain.info may have erroneously swept the address into another holding address. That's possible, since it says the transfer occurred on a BCI IP adress.

3) The vanity address generator I used (https://bitcoinvanity.appspot.com) has been compromised. I haven't seen anything on the web indicating that, but it's the most likely thing, since it's the only address that's been compromised in my wallet. I'm 100% certain my traffic wasn't packet-sniffed since I created the vanity address on my home network, which is highly-engineered and secured by me. I'm on a Chromebook that I regularly check for malware, so I'm not being keylogged. The only vulnerability is the obvious one: the service.

I'm hoping and praying, at this point, that it's #2, and BCI can fix it, but I know that I've been scammed, and it was stupid to put a non-trivial amount of BTC into a newly created address that's possibly insecure... I know in the pit of my stomach that it's #3.

I ping a few people I know that can fast track my ticket at BCI, and get directly in touch with [Mandrik of Blockchain.info](https://www.google.com/search?q=mandrik+blockchain&amp;rlz=1CAZZAB_enUS564US564&amp;oq=mandrik+bloc&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0.2817j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8), who was very apologetic as he confirmed what I suspected.

He pointed me to [a discussion I'd missed](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=445764.0;all) in my research on the vanity address service that described what had happened to me. I noted that the transaction showed that it was relayed by BCI, but as I suspected and he confirmed, that meant very little:

*""There really isn't anything we can do if the funds really were stolen, whether the transaction was relayed by us or not. Anyone can relay a transaction through our site, but they could just as easily do it from any other wallet app. They could easily import any private key across multiple wallets if they wanted to, too. If these funds were stolen, then they are essentially gone forever. The only person who can return them is the one who has access to the key the funds were sent to.""*

At some point, I'll probably pursue some legal action against this company (there is a British corporation listed, according to a friend I was just on the phone with). I haven't had the time to contemplate or investigate my options - this all happened over the last couple of hours. 

**Here's the lessons to take away from this one:**

1) Don't trust third-party services (free or paid) with non-trivial amounts of coin unless they have a seriously impeccable reputation.

2) Blockchain.info customer service is pretty bad-ass, but they're not miracle workers. *Irreversible transactions are irreversible.*

3) If you're using a third-party service where you're risking non-trivial amounts of money, and you have a seed of doubt, either **conclusively** quash that seed through research, or don't use them. 

*Postscript: I've never used the tipping system on Reddit, so I'm not sure how it works. If you want/can, you can tip me for this post - after losing 2 BTC, I'm not going to turn away charity. I'm not doing this for the charity so much as doing this for others. Being scammed is the worst feeling, even when it's trivial amounts of money... if this helps one other person avoid my fate, I'll consider my taking one for the team worth it.*",cryptocurrency,1392702148

gaming,Performance designed products. or: How good products can be ruined by terrible customer support.,"So, I'm a little miffed right now. and yes, this is kind of a rant. But I'll try not to make it too ranty...

That said, let me start off properly by saying, I actually do kind of like PDP products, mostly their afterglow series and I have a few of their rockcandy controllers. and between 3 consoles, if my controller isn't first party, it's probably a PDP controller.

I think, that's going to be changing from now on. and not because of their controllers. Over a month ago(Jan 16th) I ordered the 200 dollar afterglow headset. Excited as a little boy on christmas when the package arrived in the post, I'm sure you can understand my dismay when I learned that THEY SENT THE WRONG HEADPHONES.

Yes, I ordered the 200 dollar pair, with dolby 5.1 surround sound and charging stand. I got the 100 dollar base model...So, I went to their support site.

For some reason, despite the button still being there, their live chat is NEVER there and you have to either call in, or submit a ticket. Because the phone line was already unattended by the time I had got home, I submitted a ticket.

the next day, well enough, I had to submit proof of purchase and was told to keep the headphones I had gotten, and they'd send a new pair in. GOODIE! I thought, a free pair of headphones, for a simple mistake? What would possibly go wrong!

So, I submit the proof they asked for(a few pictures and information so they could verify I did indeeed receive the wrong headphones) and they shipped the new pair off!

three days pass, and the new pair gets here. Delighted, I set it up for my computer, having plugged the original pair into my PS3 to use for online gaming there. All goes well, I noticed the ""dolby"" light wasn't on, but thought nothing of it. I didn't use the headphones that often so it took about a week for them to die, and thats when I realized....the stand wasn't working as a charger...

So, I send another ticket it, thinking it might be a simple problem. Much to my surprise I learned that I got a defective stand, and would need to send these ones in as well...Ah well, I suppose it would be too much expect TWO free pairs of headphones...

and, that's the last I've heard of them. Yup, I sent the headphones in. I even tracked them, and know that they've received the headphones approx 4 days ago..

So, 2 days ago, I put in another support ticket asking what was going on. and I've gotten nothing back. I'm going to try phoning them tomorrow if I have time, but I'm not entirely sure I will be able to within the hours that they're operated.

and yes, I'm aware that the time-frame may seem wonky, but I put everything in ""business days"". Not calander days - 4 days ago is meaningless on a monday, and some of it are estimations as I forget exactly. But, all in all it's taken just over a month.

If someone could give this a look-over and help me with some of the related bold questions, I'd really appreciate it. 

**INCOME**
=====
My regular annual income after tax (assuming no deductions) will be ~$43,000 a year (~$3600/mo). At the end of the year, I expect to get a bonus of ~$3000 after tax.

On top of that take-home money, I'll get ~$11k a year dumped into a 401k held with Vanguard (Woo!). That will scale up with any raises I get in the future.

**Considering my debts and house-buying goals, should I try to top the 401k off ASAP, or should I wait until I get raises and have the extra income to spread around?**

**DEBT**
==============

My only debts right now are in federal student loans, currently deferred until 6/22:

Subsidized Loan: 6,600 @ 3.4%

Subsidized Laon: 3,700 @ 4.5%

Unsubsidized Loan: 19,700 @ 6.8%

**DEFINITE EXPENSES**
======
This is going to be ballparked since I haven't moved yet, and I don't have a car/insurance, but I've got a good idea for some of them and I'm guessing rather high. I don't have a car right now, but that will likely be one of my first goals. My medical insurance is covered through my employer.

Starting from 3600/mo:

-1600/mo for rent/utils (probably closer to 1200, actually)

-400/mo groceries

-300/mo for student loan?

* **That's based on the more aggressive 10 year repayment plan, is that a good amount to pay? Maybe just until the 6.8% part is paid off?**

That leaves 1300/mo unallocated.

**CAR**
=======

I'll admit that I'm pretty deficient in any knowledge pertaining to car ownership. I've gotten along pretty well without a car up until this point, and, if I get a place near my job, I can probably manage without one for a month or more. I do know that I don't want anything flashy, and I'll definitely buy used. I was thinking some sort of small pickup or something like a Civic. 


**Working with super round numbers, what do you think I'd pay for a vehicle that won't disintegrate during the first year or two that I own it? Should/could I save up for a few months and pay cash? If not, how does financing work?**

Any tips/model suggestions/whatever would be totally appreciated as well. 

**Is $300/mo (1800/6mo) a reasonable auto insurance estimate for a 23 y/o with no history?**

**HOUSE**
======
So, looking well into the future here, I would like to own my own home some day. 

**After getting my regular expenses settled, building up a security buffer, and all the rest, where will I want to put money to save for a house if we're talking at least 5 years before I'd be interested in buying?**",finance,1392731153
Bitcoin,War on Bitcoin,"I’d like to ask you to remember where you were a decade or so ago, in the year 2000. I’m going to list some of the things that have happened since then. Did it cross your mind that we would see…
• Two stock market crashes of 1929 proportions and a financial crisis that almost brought down the entire global banking system.
• Youth unemployment in Greece at 62.5%, Spain at 57%, Portugal at 43%, Italy at 40% and an EU average of 24.4%. Or the Greeks calling Germans Nazis.
• Interest rates in the US at 0.25% and in the UK at 0.5% for years on end, runs on banks as people discover their money isn’t safe and the Bank of England actually printing money.
• A gap between rich and poor that has grown so big the richest 400 people in the world have assets equivalent to the poorest 140 million. The wealthiest 1% of Americans pocket a quarter of the country’s income and control as much as half of the nation’s total wealth, with CEOs of large banks and other large corporations earning as much as a thousand times more than low-ranking employees.
• The average age of the first-time UK house buyer at almost 40, with an entire generation of people in the UK that believing they will never own a home. Yet only 2.5% of British land is actually built on.
• Obesity rates of 25% in the developed world, yet almost a billion people suffering from chronic undernourishment, while over half the food we produce – some 2 billion tonnes – gets thrown away each year.
• 36 million people across the globe taking part in 3,000 protests against a war in the Middle East – and UK and US government ignoring them and going ahead with it anyway.
• Healthcare spending more than doubling from £68 billion to £143 billion in the 11 years to 2011, yet ‘basic clinical failings’ being commonplace across the NHS – with one NHS trust found liable for 1,200 people dying while in its care and a further five trusts facing investigation.
• Spending on schools in the UK rising by over 86%, while the Ofsted chief inspector declares ‘standards have stalled’.
• And debt. Oh, my goodness. The UK currently owes, excluding bank bail-out costs, just under £1.2 trillion. That’s almost £40,000 per working person. In just five years the coalition government, on a so-called austerity drive, will add £700 billion to the national debt. That’s more than the combined total of every British government of the past 100 years. For all the talk of ‘fiscal cliffs’ and ‘debt ceilings’ in the US, President Barack Obama has overseen an administration that, in its first term, increased the national debt by 60%, adding $6 trillion. The first 41 presidents only managed $5 trillion combined.
Many of these things were unthinkable ten years ago, yet they are now part of our daily experience. A lot seems to be going wrong. Is this just an inevitable fact of life, or is it something else? I happen to think it’s something else. And that’s what this book is about. Many of our most fundamental institutions, social arrangements, economic policies and political ideas seem to be breaking down. They are either in acute crisis, or close to it. Things that we have taken for granted for decades – that a bank is a safe place to put money, that the NHS looks after its patients, or that European countries have left the conflicts of the Second World War behind them, for example – are now in doubt. If we are coming to some sort of boiling point, it’s essential to understand what the fundamental problems actually are and how they came about, otherwise there is the real danger that, misguidedly, we replace what we have with something worse – as happened with Fidel Castro’s great Cuban revolution, Communist Russia and Nazi Germany. ‘Only a crisis – actual or perceived,’ said economist Milton Friedman, ‘produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.
I subscribe to George Orwell’s view that, ‘on the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.’ The problem, as I see it, is not so much individuals but systems. Accidentally or otherwise, our systems of government, finance and economics have been modified and manipulated and now no longer have the effects their originators intended; they have become entrenched, out of anyone’s control, and seemingly possible to change or remove. It feels like the West is an unstoppable train, hurtling down the tracks; but we are on the wrong tracks, going to the wrong place. Nothing seems to slow this train, let alone reverse it. It’s too big; it’s going too fast.",cryptocurrency,1392731405

&gt;Much has been learned in the last 50 years about “money / currency”. The goal presumably to find out what the best possible money is, then adopt it. The choices made deciding our monetary policy should be a matter of political debate. This debate though has largely been out of the public eye.

This is bullshit. Trade and international trade have been ongoing since the days of bartering. Money/currency is a centuries old concept. The goal is for exchange – not to find the best currency and adopt it. WTF? 

&gt;One needs to realize that the type of money used by a civilization has direct consequences on the distribution of wealth, the distribution of real physical resources, and the distribution of power. How money flows through the system results in how goods &amp; services flow. Bottlenecks and distortions in the flow of money result in distortions of the real economy.

It’s not the type of money that matters- it’s credit that matters. We don’t pay in lumps of bread that deplete over a number of days starting from the bank to the layman. Having access to credit and the premiums paid for credit is much more a cause of inequality than a type of money. 

&gt;Since this crisis began SIX YEARS ago, governments have been acquiring real assets by drawing on an empty but limitless bank account. The government does not even need to incur the expense of actually printing money to create billions of dollars of bank credit (that can be distributed to bank shareholders). 

This is a joke. Governments have been using deficit financing for as long as governments have been around. To say something changed 6 years ago shows a lack of economic history and frankly just history.

&gt;Central banks have changed their official role from maintaining a fixed, counterfeit free supply to actively trying to manipulate the economy through monetary policy. 

It has never been an official role to maintain a fixed supply of money unless you’re talking about the gold standard. And don't get me started on the fucking gold standard. 

&gt;Governments have targeted inflation in a period of natural deflation (by natural deflation I am referring to the natural process of prices decreasing because of better technology, better economies of scale, and higher productivity). Because of pressures of natural deflation central banks have been in constant monetary expansion. 

CENTRAL BANKS – not governments - have been using inflation targeting for many years and it has nothing to do with “natural deflation”. I can guarantee you that no central bank looks at the “natural deflation” of technology as a metric for monetary expansion. Monetary expansion has more to do with liquidity and avoiding business cycle contractions than natural deflation. 

&gt;No other globally traded asset has decreased in value more consistently than fiat money.

Who cares? Does this affect your ability to purchase anything? As long as your wages increase with the amount of decrease in value of a single dollar, then this isn’t a valid complaint. If you don’t increase your money supply, how do you deal with an ever-increasing population?

&gt;Government manipulations distort the economy. Several results, some more visible in one economy compared to another: 1. The effect of monetary policy in China has been to funnel credit primarily to government owned enterprises and government friendly businesses at the expense of other actors in the Chinese economy, strengthening the control of the communist party.

Comparing the actions of the Chinese government with others is a joke if your point is to make overall comments on monetary policy.

&gt;2. In much of the western world (Canada, US, Britain most visibly), easy money policy increased house prices drastically. 

Now the problem is easy money? You mentioned earlier that it was the financial sector’s fault based on the tie between ratings agencies and the banks issuing loans. One is a regulatory or financial sector fail (however you view it), and the other is an economic argument on monetary policy that has never been conclusive in the way that Paul Volcker and deflation can be proved. The link is more like this - a bust in the 01 tech bubble moved lots of money out of stocks and into assets - house prices started to climb and banks got in the business of making many more loans and taking the risk off their balance sheets through investment ""packages"" (securitization) - the packages were full of bad loans - a recession hits, people can't make payments - housing market and economy crashes. The central bank's ""easy money"" was not the arbiter of destruction you make it out to be. The End.

&gt;Our economy is experiencing financialization, which is a systematic exploitation of the monetary system to move wealth from the productive economy to the financial economy. In the past thirty years we have seen: 1. An increase in the size of the financial industry with respect to all other economic activity. Rising efficiency should have had the opposite effect on the industry. 2. An increase in the role of financial controllers in the management of corporations. 3. An increase in the percentage of financial assets in all tradable assets. 4. An increase in the perception that stock market fluctuation are a determinant of the business cycle.

You mean to call this globalization. This isn’t a national issue due to monetary policy. This is the natural consequence of wiring the whole damn world together and allowing currencies to be traded instantly for purchasing and selling of goods and services. And this is not a negative thing. I’m sure you like your technology good and cheap and from Asia.

&gt;We must ask ourselves: ‘will the nation continue to be the most influential actor on the flows of commerce?’ Nations limit trade, limit international cooperation, and create adversarial incentives. 

Obviously nations will be the most influential. Why? Because they make the fucking laws - domestic and international. Your arguments on nations being ‘limiting agents’ is because nations have borders. We can’t just run amuck willy-nilly doing as we please. Laws and regulations may be limiting, but they’re also setup to enhance individual freedoms. I recommend readings by Amartya Sen.

&gt;Politicians have been spouting about free trade for a generation, but ‘free trade agreements’ are complex laws designed to protect the interests of large corporations and industries. 

Bullshit. You have an econ degree. You must have skipped your international trade classes. Free trade agreements are setup to remove the inefficiencies of transactions and to allow the benefits of comparative advantage to work. Just because it isn’t 100% adopted around the world and some beneficiaries are in fact large corporations doesn’t mean the multiple benefits don’t flow to consumers and laborers affected by the agreements.

TL:DR - This guy may sound good, but he needs a few more years of studying before being taken seriously. Bitcoin is becoming a currency for international trading. It has the potential to remove inefficiencies from the financial sector and it allows for a greater number of international transactions to occur outside restrictive government capital requirements. ~~Keep investing.~~ I don't give a shit.",cryptocurrency,1392740197

I suppose the financially sensible option is to contribute to an IRA and recoup the taxmoney. I need a minimum of 3k in order to open a Vanguard IRA commonly recommended, but I need less than that to eliminate my tax liability. My inclination is to *not* do that, since I’m happier having that money in my savings account. It’s part of my 12 month emergency fund/new car slush fund. I’ve worked hard over the past year to build both and have more than doubled them. I don’t want to turn it into a 9 or 10 month emergency/crummy Chevy Cavalier fund by taking money out right now.

My strategy last year of making saving simple and automatic seems to be working very well. I plan to focus on doing the same thing next year.
I know that all of you are very rational, numbers-oriented, middle class folks,  but I am not, so I'm looking for your advice. My own inclination is to stay the course.

Bitcoin,Andreas discusses the value of decentralization IN ALL THINGS.,"If you haven't already, I can't recommend listening to[ Andreas in Milwaukee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b8RDFuLuRc&amp;app=desktop) enough. He begins around 47 minutes in.

Bitcoin is interesting because I have no doubt that for some of you, I'll be preaching to the choir. It's for the rest of you who perhaps disagree, or haven't considered it, that I felt the need to write this.

Andreas speaks to the fragility of a centralized entity. How you can corrupt the center, and disrupt/destroy the whole thing. I beg of you to consider that decentralization in all things results in greater strength, security, &amp; liberty. Independence.  If you study the US war for independence, you will discover that incredibly resilient, independent, riflemen, of all trades &amp; occupations, rallied to defend the against the greatest military the world have ever known.

There is a line, which may or may not be an actual quote, but correctly portrays a strength of the US at one time; ""You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass."".

By design, the colonies formed a confederacy. Decentralization allowed for a market effect among the states. They were each competing to be the freest, most profitable, states to live, and produce, in. By design the national government wasn't meant to have one head, but be decentralized to have checks &amp; balances against abuses of power. If they did not, in theory you could corrupt only the center and do things like have one man with the ability to consolidate the legislative, executive, and judicial, branches under their own control, when they decide the situation is a ""catastrophe"". You could have them imprison people in camps, and assassinated with no due process. Steal wealth for themselves &amp; their allies. Deploy drones. Track &amp; spy on the people. Etc.. With centralization of power, intel, etc., one could corrupt the entire country.

The things that came to mind for me listening to Andreas are these;

When I first read about the police cars with the plate readers I thought to myself that people shouldn't stand for this, as it would take very few of them in the right places to monitor what an entire city was doing, and when. The state wasn't meant to have this type of information.

There must be an armed citizenry for there to be any chance of freedom. It provides greater security for families, neighborhoods, cities, and the nation.

The sovereign individual (I recommend checking out [Good To Be King, by Michael Badnarik](http://www.amazon.com/Good-To-King-Foundation-Constitutional/dp/1594110964/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392751275&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords=good+to+be+kind+badnarik)). ""State's rights"". Confederacy. I challenge those of you who feel a strong, centralized, government is advantageous, or necessary, but who also realize &amp; recognize the merits Andreas speaks of for decentralization in currency, or networks, to please consider that the same is true for security, and liberty, &amp; everything else. The states have all but lost the market effect encouraging freedom, and prosperity. Hopefully the people up in New Hampshire (&amp; elsewhere, of course) can bring that back to some extent. Trying to attain greater prosperity &amp; freedom through centralized government... as Andreas would ask, ""How's that working out for you?"".


Edit:  It occurred to me that after posting this that perhaps this is considered inappropriate for r/bitcoin. It seems relevant to me. A percentage of bitcoin users wish to corrupt what bitcoin is with regulation, and restriction. Those of you who do no doubt believe this will strengthen BTC. My intention is to ask them to think twice, because the opposite is true, &amp; BTC's existence depends on it. Please consider not the exchange rate of BTCs to your prefered legal tender (which will be negatively effected by the collapse of BTC's purpose), but the reason BTC was invented, and the good it will do for every being on the planet if it is allowed to continue.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Strategy?,"I'm in the process of reevaluating my budget and savings goals, and am considering a change in my student loan repayment plan as a result. First, context: I'm in a job making a comfortable enough amount to pay my loans, insurance, rent, and other required expenses, along with a small amount left over for entertainment. I'm also saving approximately $300 a month for my emergency fund, which is only up to about $1000 now. It isn't much yet, but it feels good to have some buffer if something unthinkable happens! I'm also saving small amounts pretax in my 401(k) and an HSA.

Now, I'm currently on a 10-year repayment plan for $30,000 in federal student loans. All of them are fixed-rate between 2.5% and 6.8%. I'm making my payments while also saving, but would like to devote more of my income to savings and aggressively attacking the highest interest loans rather than spreading it out on the lower interest ones at the same time.

From what I can tell, under a graduated repayment plan, I could halve my minimum payments, thus giving me more flexibility to determine where my money goes. Ideally, this would allow me to continue making my current payment amount, while directing more of the payment towards my highest interest loans. For the first few months I may direct some of the money that would have gone to my loans to my savings until I have a more sizable emergency fund built up.

Is there something above I'm not thinking about or mistaken on? As long as I have the discipline to stick to my budget and continue making large payments, I think this strategy would help cut down on interest accrued in the long term. Thanks in advance for any help or feedback!

EDIT: I also forgot to mention one further bonus I've considered is the flexibility the lower payments would provide if I were to lose my job. I don't foresee that happening, but I like to plan ahead, especially considering the low size of my emergency fund!",finance,1392755616

personalfinance,Money set aside for Roth IRA--not sure if we should use for debt instead,"My SO and I have $11000 earmarked to start both of our Roth IRAs, but we still owe ~$9000 in Federal student loans (6.55%) and ~$3000 on a car loan (4.5%). Is it better to pay off the student loan and part of the car loan, rather than start our retirement savings?

Other relevant info: 

We are both self-employed and in our mid-twenties. We both have been reinvesting heavily into our own businesses, and that combined with a massive car accident a year ago that kept my SO from working for 6 months, and severely cut the hours I was capable of working, means that we have nothing saved for retirement. All we have is a small emergency fund that we've been slowly replenishing after wiping out all our savings in the months following the accident. No credit card debt though, thank god. 

The good news is, our businesses are both doing very well, and we expect to be able to open SEP IRAs next year and contribute quite a bit. We live as cheaply as we can for our area--SF bay area, high cost of living. Hopefully that will allow us to make up for some lost time.

The only other thing that we are considering spending the money on is a new (used, new-to-us) full-sized truck for my SO. He's an electrician, in the process of getting his electrical contractor's license. He has a small pickup (1st generation Toyota Tacoma) that we bought with cash a few years ago but he needs a larger truck so he doesn't have to make multiple trips to job sites, and to haul large spools of wire and all the parts he needs. We want to buy it outright, rather than take out a loan. If we sold his Tacoma (for ~$8000; it's in great shape) we could buy him a good used truck with that and the Roth money. I was almost loathe to mention it because it seems crazy to spend money earmarked for retirement on a depreciating material good, but it would increase his productivity (he does bid jobs only, so time spent making multiple trips is costing him money, not to mention overloading his Tacoma is causing it to depreciate more rapidly than it should).

Most of his recent newsletters follow a similar vein - he talks about a [demographic cliff](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/harry-dent-demographic-cliff-2013-12) - a bearish outlook caused by the Baby Boomers retiring, leading on to deflation and a weakening economy.

He lists other ""ticking time bombs"":

 * The faux U.S. real-estate recovery since 2012 looks to be faltering as interest rates rise and investors start to back off after price gains from renting and flipping look less attractive. We expect real estate to turn down again and to drop another 30% before this bubble has deflated.

 * China is losing control over its private-shadow banking sector, which continues to fuel the out-of-control real-estate bubble its government is trying to slow. Ironically, this is the very bubble it created in the first place with its over-investment in everything.

 * The southern Europe crisis will only worsen ahead, despite endless bailouts and European Central Bank (ECB) pledges to buy the bonds of failing nations. 

 * The Fed is increasingly in checkmate as rising growth in the economy will force it to taper and withdraw the stimulus crack… but if the economy continues to falter, it’ll become increasingly clear that the stimulus is no longer working, just like what we saw in Europe in 2012.

So basically he's forecasting doom and gloom ahead.

He's saying that the whole BTC currency is nothing different than a central bank and the currency that is released is highly regulated on what they want to do with it, just like with the Federal Reserve.  


When I argued the matter, he continued to say that, that is exactly how bitcoins work and that ""someone"" controls how much money is out for the public just like the banks today and that is how/why the price fluctuates.

From my understanding, he's got bitcoins completely wrong.
I went ahead and told him that it's nothing like a central bank and the currency isn't regulated at all.  I also told him about the controlled supply of btc and that they are dependent on the network and miners.  I tried to explain that nobody is in control of the amount of coins in circulation and the price is based on supply and demand.

He responded by saying that if I really don't think they are regulated, that I'm a fool (maybe I am).  He's convinced that BTC aren't any different than a bank.

So after a lot of financial and emotional hardship, I'm finally in a good place to get my debt back in order. I've already set up a payment plan with my federal student loan for the income based repayment plan (which is a huge help, by the way!).


I've used a credit consolidation agency before to help with negotiating with collection agencies and getting lower interest rates, but I know they don't handle private student loans. I have two of those (both in default): one with Chase and one with NJ Class.


My first question is what's the best way to go about dealing with these? Should I just contact the collection agency outright and see if they'll work with me on rehabilitating or something like that? Or is there another agency to help with that?


Now my next question is what's the best way to deal with a charge off? I had never heard of this before, apparently they are no longer pursuing collection, but it still shows as defaulted on my credit report and will stay there for 7 years (I believe it's 7 years from the day it went to collections?). Now, the big chunk of my debt is student loans, (I have less than $4,000 in credit card debt) and there are 3 or 4 accounts that have been charged off which are all amounts of a couple hundred dollars. The thing is, they've only got about 4 more years on my credit, which is the same amount of time it will take to pay off the rest of my credit card debt on the current plan I'm on. So should I just save money and wait for them to come off my credit report? Or should I just pay it off and deal with it?


I apologize if any of this is confusing. Getting my credit score back on track has been so overwhelming to do all by myself.


I wish I had someone who could sit down with me to go over everything and give me advice. I have no idea where to start looking or who to contact about something like that, but I was hoping reddit would be able to point me in the right direction.

After working out the math, I will need approximately $205,000 to cover all expenses over the next 4 years. This price is similar at each of the schools I got into. 

I currently have $15,000 in my savings, and my mother has approximately $90,000 waiting in some kind of educational account that was meant for all my siblings to use, but I'm the only one going to school so I get the whole amount. The school has offered me $16,000 in scholarships over the next 4 years, so that gives me approximately $85,000 to take out in federal loans. I was told it would be best to take out loans as late as I can (so not until my third year of school). I plan to work part time during school, but expect to only be able to make $10,000 or so each year. I've looked at a few interest calculators, and it looks like interest could be up to $40,000 if I take ten years to pay it back! 

I budget very well and track every cent that I spend using mint.com, and I only have monthly payments for rent, cell phone, and auto insurance. I've been a student my whole life and often work several part time (10 hrs/week) jobs throughout the year, and can't always guarentee my income each month.

So tell me, am I being stupid? I've always wanted to be an optometrist, but the prospect of having up to $125,000 debt including interest to pay back seems like a huge mistake. As of right now the job prospects look good for new grads, and I think the average optometrist in my area makes ~$80,000 per year directly out of school.

**EDIT**: After three weeks I finally got an email from campbx saying they've rebroadcast the coins. I've confirmed they're on the blockchain with 70~ confirmations. Not really sure what to make of the entire situation or process. I've used them before, and while I'm sure to likely use them again I'm going to limit my exposure at a time how much I'm transferring across.

personalfinance,New Air Force 2Lt could use some student loan/investing/personal finance advice.,"Greetings PF! I will be a 2Lt in the USAF in just a couple weeks now and finally have a steady income (and a 6 year commitment). I have no credit cards, and essentially no credit to speak of, either good or bad. I have student loans to pay off though, somewhere around 80k (federal and private), but the private is in my parents name. I've lived pretty frugally my whole life, so I'm not too worried about doing whatever is possible to pay the loans off quickly. 

I was thinking about investing in mutual funds, but it seems like the rate of return is going to be just as good as the interest on the loans I'm paying anyway. Or does someone know about a super low interest option that I could use to combine my federal and private loans? I've heard good things about USAA...

personalfinance,[US] Tax Questions: Deducting State and Local Income Taxes,"Hi! I have done several searches on this and some reading online, but I am still kind of confused. I do my own taxes (because I have an uncomplicated life), but I may have missed an opportunity for some money that I'd like to correct going forward. I spoke with a young accountant friend of mine who may have made me even more confused. This is about tax deductions for income taxes.

I live in Maryland, am a W2 employee, unmarried with no loans, and make ~$100K / year. Maryland has both state and local income taxes, in addition to the US federal taxes. Last year my State Income Tax withholding was more than the standard deduction (by about $1400).

I read somewhere that state income taxes can be deducted from your federal returns. That's awesome, free money, right? Well, I don't understand a few things. This is my understanding (and confusion).

To start: if my state tax amount withheld is larger than the standard deduction, I always want to itemize, correct? That in and of itself means it is worth itemizing?

Second: deductions are not the same as the actual taxes owed. My employer makes a guess on how much to deduct from each paycheck for taxes based on how many deductions I tell them I have. I don't know what my exact amount owed is until I actually fill out the tax paperwork for the year. If I can deduct my state income tax from my federal return, I need to know what my actual state tax amount is. When I go to fill out my State Taxes (so I can deduct them from federal), they require me to first fill out the Federal Return (MD comptroller explicitly states federal must be filled out first). How can I fill out the federal form correctly if I can deduct state tax, but am not supposed to fill out the state tax form to determine my exact state taxes until I file the federal return?! I'm stuck in a loop!

Third: I spoke with an accountant friend who mentioned that I do NOT want to deduct state taxes, because I will have to report the deduction as income on my next year's taxes, and this will be an overall bad idea. I don't really understand this point and thought he was just confused or I wasn't explaining things correctly, but [then I read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1pr7o4/what_are_some_ways_i_can_reduce_my_federal_tax/cd59whb) - which seems to speak to the issue. Unfortunately, I don't understand what the heck they mean.

This should be a super easy concept. SO MANY people do their own taxes and tons of them have state/local taxes to consider. I don't know why I'm not getting what must be a simple concept, but I could really use a pointer on how to do this. I know it's not rocket science, but I am not understanding the mechanics.

Can anyone help demystify this (none of my friends do their own taxes). Is there a piece of a particular IRS pub I should be reading?

Thank you so, so much.",finance,1392788903
investing,I am getting married!!!,"And the interest on our wedding fund absolutely sucks. I have a fairly large chunk of change sitting in a high yield savings account right now. Enough to cover the upper end of the average wedding. Is there a smarter, lowish risk place to park it that will yield better than high yield savings?

Perhaps this thread isn't really for myself, but for others in a similar situation, since my wedding is latter this year. What is the best way to safely grow a ""splurge"" fund with interest rates being what they are? I hate to park large sums of money just to watch it sit there and rot. For a big chunk of my ""emergency savings"" (i.e. the ""I would not need to touch this within 4-6 months under worst case scenario"" fund) I have it in dividend yielding blue chips.

personalfinance,UGH. I have no idea what I'm doing with school loans! Halp?!,"Hey, PF.

You guys really helped me on my last freakout, so I figured I might come to you with this school loan stuff. 
 
edit: I x-posted this in r/studentloans

Background:
After 5 years of not doing anything with my community college education, I finally decided to go back to school.  I'm pursuing an Art Direction program at Miami Ad School (really small ad agency school). I plan on working as much as I can during those months. That probably means part time as a waitress. People keep telling me its a pretty rigorous program so I don't know what's actually going to happen with work. But I do have other bills to pay in addition to tuition and living (car [$140], car insurance [$150], phone [$90], some credit cards [&gt;$3,000]). Oh, and there are no scholarship options for me.  Hopefully I can get a job making $60,000 on the low end out of school with this program and $80,000 on a good day.

*I have no prior experience with student loans.*

The school's yearly expense estimate with tuition, books, lodging, etc is ~$45,000. Tuition is ~$4,350 a quarter. 
It's a two year program.

I Fafsa'd the crap out of my life these last few weeks and will be awarded $3,465 a quarter.  Here's that break down:

Fed Subsidized:         $1,167
Fed Unsubsidized:      $2,000
Pell:                        $298

Basically for year 1, I'm getting $10,395 in Fed help. And am responsible for the remainder $35,000.  

Ouch.

So I applied for a private loan from PNC Bank.  I'm 23 with some credit history.  A pretty good score (at least it was, last time I checked... should probably check again). I applied to borrow $25,000 (because I dont think I'll actually need the full estimated $45,000).  Here's what they offered me:


Fixed Rate:

$25,000 @ 11.49% fixed
Repayment: 180 months
$386.92/month if fully deferred while in school
total: $69,645.60	

-OR-

Variable Rate 
$25,000 @ 9.17 Variable
Repayment: 180 months
$322.65/month if fully deferred while in school
total: $58,077.00

This is all for 1 year (so I'll need to do it again next year). And all without a co-signer (my parents a huge into not helping me at all financially.  In fact to the point where I'm wayyyy better off not even asking).

I'm freaking out about all this and have no idea what to do. 

The only thing that will change next year is that I will be 24 and will be an independent student (that should get me a little more federal aid, as I understand).

Any advice would be so very much appreciated. 

***edit: so turns out that 45k was an estimate and not something that I actually have to take out. AND I reapply as an independent student in JUNE! That means I get more federal aid! AND I still plan on paying loans during school (about $150 a month) so that it won't be so bad later! AND I found some better rates and will probably be asking my parents to cosign a loan with me (my state loan).",finance,1392793673

dogecoin,My 10 Predictions for Dogecoin through 2016,"I was thinking ahead and wondering what might happen in the next couple of years for dogecoin if it takes off in popularity. Since I'm not a market guru, I'm not making guesses about price or market cap. Instead, these 10 predictions center around the mainstream acceptance and use of dogecoin.

1. References to dogecoin are first written into television sitcoms such as the *Big Bang Theory* and *Two Broke Girls* as the punchlines to jokes, but the adoption by popular media ripples outward.

2. The popularity of Shiba Inus skyrockets, causing a spike in the price of puppies and shortage of them available.

3. A catastrophic natural disaster somewhere in the world prompts Shibes to send millions of dollars in donations via dogecoin to aid victims **[NOT wishing for a disaster. They just seem to happen with depressing regularity]**. The community's outpouring of kindness further adds to the positive reputation already begun with their donations to the Jamaican bobsled team. Dogecoin micro-charities using tipbot-like apps proliferate to help a variety of causes.

4. From a currency perspective, Dogecoin's strongest early adopters are the under-24 demographic, who use it to buy and sell items to each other, such as video games, clothing, jewelry, computer hardware, sports equipment, and tickets to events, as well as tipping friends for favors. Older mainstream demographics are a little slower to adopt its usage (vs. investing in it), but eventually come on board, also selling to one another via craigslist and other types of in-person transactions.

5. Dogecoin's image appears as a challenger in the same merchandising space currently occupied by Hello Kitty, with Shibes appearing on everything from stickers to handbags, toys and cell phone cases.

6. Dogecoin gift cards are sold in grocery stores and gas stations alongside those for iTunes, restaurant chains, Mastercard and Visa. Other than a small initial fee (though no doubt more than you would pay to purchase dogecoin on an exchange), the coins go into your wallet, where they can never expire or be drained away by inactivity fees.

7. Vending machines dispensing sodas, food, video rentals, and other low cost commodities begin to accept dogecoin.

8. A shadow economy springs up amongst the underemployed, the long-term unemployed, and failing middle class, notably in U.S. and Europe, to accept dogecoin as wages for part-time and temporary gigs. Should the global economy worsen, this trend only accelerates.

9. If the currency stabilizes, yet gradually increases in value, and avoids the worst of market manipulation shown in other financial sectors, dogecoin becomes a vehicle of choice for beginning investors discouraged by low interest rates on traditional savings accounts and certificates of deposit…a virtual ""doggie"" bank for spare change.

10. Dogecoin ATMs successfully graduate from the gimmick stage, appearing in large cities such as New York, London, and Sydney, before spreading to other cities, and perhaps merging with some type of traditional ATM experience (which would demonstrate capitulation and adoption by the financial sector).

Bitcoin,[Whitepaper] Decentralized Bitcoin Prediction Markets,"Hi everyone,

I work for the Yale Economics department (for a FED chairperson, in fact), and they very generously gave me 2 weeks of time off to make a conclusive effort on the project I’ve been working on in my free time for a few months, now. That good news aside, I’m feeling a little burnt out so I’m hoping to get some kind of support from the community or the project will probably stall out at this plateau.


Basically what I’ve done is built an incentive system which allows for the creation of Bitcoin Prediction Markets. As I mention in a first draft of my applications paper, these markets can be used for a number of purposes:

1.	Use the combined knowledge and intellectual ability of mankind to construct and refine the most accurate possible prediction of the future.
2.	End debates about the contentious issues of today, such as climate-change, heritability of IQ, effect of GMOs etc.
3.	Prevent lying from anyone (even politicians, industry leaders) about a target claim. 
4.	Encourage and compensate whistleblowers.
5.	Provide ‘market advice’ on the relative impact of decisions on outcomes (“If we adopt X Fed policy, what effect on inflation can we expect?”).
6.	Provide insurance (buying and selling) opportunities for catastrophic global disasters, earthquakes, hurricane, etc.
7.	Allow tradable binary financial derivatives, for example on the BTC exchange rate, or the solvency of exchanges.
8.	Fun recreational gambling in real time, always at actuarially fair odds and low fees.
9.	Allows for the creation of ‘Trustless Dominant Assurance Contracts’ which allow financing of public goods such as lighthouse, roads, etc. with no counterparty risk.

Because the protocol (in theory) forces individuals to vote realistically on after-the-fact measureable outcomes, the protocol also has applications beyond prediction markets (as the Bitcoin blockchain has applications beyond transactions).
Here is the abstract to my paper:

 Abstract. Where Bitcoin allows for the decentralized exchange of value, this paper addresses the decentralized creation and administration of Prediction Markets (PMs). An alternative proof-of-work blockchain collects information on the creation and state of PMs, with the winning state of a market determined by a modified weighted-vote. An incentive mechanism attempts to guarantee a) that all voters vote honestly, and b) that PM-creators act as entrepreneurs, bearing the economic costs and benefits of the PMs they create. Bitcoin users can create PMs on any subject, or trade anonymously within any PM, and all PMs enjoy low fees and infinite market liquidity through a LMSR market maker. Scalability and customizability can be achieved via ‘branching’ (controlled-fork). The paper closes with a discussion of implementation details. 

Hopefully there is enough interest reach out to other collaborators (Bitcoin Foundation, Altcoin developers, etc.)
The entire project can ride on its own blockchain, or possibly even in the OP_RETURNs of the Bitcoin blockchain, no hard fork or any major change required.

I’ve avoided the final puzzle piece, which is how to have the protocol sign withdrawal transactions (for people to move their Bitcoin back into addresses they control). I provided 7 possible approaches, but even that was probably a waste of my time because I’m sure any professional dev would instantly know their favorite approach, and, (moreover) new approaches are constantly invented (example: Etherium was invented after I wrote the paper). 

Thanks for reading!

personalfinance,Paying more toward student loans or car loan?,"Hi y'all, 

I'm pretty sure this question has an obvious answer, but heck. I am just wondering if you guys think I should pay down my car or pay more toward student loans. The loans are on the Income-Based Repayment plan and my payment decreased significantly this year due to income fluctuations (layoffs, changing jobs, etc). Info: 

* Car: 2000 Volvo S70, 220k+ miles (not sure off the top of my head), needs $2k in repairs
* Car Note: $2,903.45 of 4500.00 @ 3.25%/ 82.00/mo.
* Student Loans: Multiple at Slightly over $23k, interest rates vary from 4.6-6.8%
* Student Loan Payment: $11.53/mo (previously $83.06)

My current concern is that this payment amount doesn't even begin to cover the interest on my student loans, so if I can pay more to help cover interest accrual, that might be wise. However, with the car almost fully depreciated and in need of some big repairs (aka major clunker) I think it's probably best if I go ahead and pay the difference between the old student loan payment and the new one toward the car note. That would be an extra $71.00 a month, which would definitely help me pay it off quicker. 

My fiance and I are considering paying it off if I can get the loan below $2k, so I would like to do that ASAP. We're getting married in May, and we were thinking we would donate the vehicle and take the tax writeoff. If you have advice on that, that would be helpful. 

I wish I didn't have the car payment in the first place (long story), so I'm doing my best to eliminate it as quickly as possible. My fiance and I both want me to keep contributing the $200 a month to savings to build my emergency fund back up to $1k as quickly as possible, or I might consider contributing some of that toward the loan as well. I'm finally renting a place that is affordable to me given my income situation, so I feel fortunate enough that I can finally contribute to savings. But moving on. What say you, Reddit? 

P.S. I have read the sidebar, a lot of times. :) Thanks for reading my novella.

Attorney Fees (I'm an idiot.): $5,000 (soon to be $7,500, but 0% interest and no payment deadline)

I just threw $1,800 at my credit card balance to get it under $2,500, and I plan on using my tax refund to hopefully pay it off. Is this the best course of action? I assume it is best to pay off the thing with the highest interest rate first, but perhaps I'm wrong? I know this debt isn't that much compared to others, but I was hit hard by the government shutdown (contractor, we didn't get paid back), which is why I got a second job in January. I have $200 in savings, and basically no back-up plan. I do put $50 a month towards savings, for what it's worth, but it seems a bit like throwing a cup of water on a bonfire. I graduated in May 2013, found a job in July but it's an 18 month contract position so I know I'm not guaranteed my salary come December. I'm 26 and I feel like I'm drowning. My goal was to pay off all debts by the time my contract is over, but then I had to pay a really expensive attorney which may all be for naught in the end anyway. I want to have a home one day, and a dog, and maybe  enough money for a (cheap) international vacation once every two years or so. Where do I start?",finance,1392833178

You guys have been a huge help to me in the past and I am turning to you once again.  I am using free tax software since I financially qualify.  I live in NC now, but resided and worked the majority of 2013 in GA.

Well I guess this last place reported ALL of my tips unlike restaurants that I worked for in the past.  I am taking full responsibility for not looking closer at this, but restaurant workers are used to never getting a paycheck because they only get $2.13ish an hour which gets eaten up by taxes completely...I guess not enough in this case.

For example, unlike the Federal Government, New Jersey does not allow you to exclude from wages amounts you contribute to deferred compensation and retirement plans, other than 401(k) plans.  

My agency provides all employees both the TSP and a C. Schwab 401(k). The 401(k) actually has good fund choices with a number of Vanguard Admiral funds.

Beyond matching, which should I be contributing the rest to?  Will the current year 5.xx% savings on the 401k contributions be the better deal?  Or will the lower expenses of the TSP over time end up being the better deal?

personalfinance,Taxable income and tax deductions for renting out a room in my primary residence,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

Last October I bought my first starter home and am now running into questions about filing federal tax returns and the deductions that go along with home ownership.

Here is the gist of the situation:

* I closed on the home in late October and made one mortgage payment in 2013. Between purchasing points on the mortgage close, and my first mortgage payment being mostly interest, I have a little over $3,000 in deductions there if I choose to itemize. (I know that's not much, and if that was my only itemized deduction, it would make more sense to take the standard deduction).

* I am able to rent out a room to a friend for $300 a month. She rented for 1 month in 2013, bringing my taxable real estate income to a whopping $300. I know this is small beans in the income tax world, but I want to make sure I am doing my taxes correctly.

Now for the questions:

* Reporting rental income and rental deductions: From my research, it looks like I need to report the $300 rental income on Schedule E (assuming I file with the typical 1040 form). Schedule E also allows me to deduct certain rental expenses. Again based on my research, it looks like I can deduct expenses specific to that room at 100% cost (expenses such as replacing carpet in that room between tenants), and a reasonable percentage of expenses for repairs, maintenance, etc on the whole house (such as a percentage of replacing the furnace, where the percentage deducted is equal to the percentage of square footage the rented room takes up in the house). **Is my understanding correct in deducting expenses related to this rental, or should I be following different tax guidelines since the room is part of my primary residence?**

* If I am correct in deducting some real estate expenses on Schedule E, and some expenses in itemizing deductions, there is potential for overlap. Schedule E allows me to deduct mortgage interest as it relates to a rental property (again could be calculated as a percent based on square footage). **Is it better to deduct the reasonable percentage on Schedule E as a real estate expense, and the remaining portion with itemized deductions, or should it all be deducted on the itemized deductions?**

* A similar (hopefully simpler) question on deducting property taxes: I prepaid property taxes at close, and into an escrow account with my first mortgage payment. Reading the instructions for Schedule A, the state ""If your mortgage payments include your real estate taxes, you can deduct only the amount the mortgage company
actually paid to the taxing authority in 2013."" **So do I deduct the only the taxes that I prepaid at close (and was paid to the county), but not what I paid into escrow on my first mortgage payment (since that has not been paid to the county yet)?**

I know this looks like a wall of text, so if you got this far, thank you! Any input or advice would be much appreciated!",finance,1392867759
CryptoCurrency,Tax collection by way of cryptos? A Brief History of the Future of Crytocurrency.,"The year is 2020, and the US dollar is but one of many competing cryptos. Some cryptos have a less-secure physical component. But make no mistake. 99% of all funds in circulation are not only digital but cryptological.

In 2014 the state of California passed [legislation](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB129) to make cryptocurrency legal tender. Other states soon followed, leading to Federal legislation and eventual widespread public use of cryptocurrency.

There is some speculation as to the mysterious beginnings of crypocurrency. A 1996 NSA [report](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm) ‘predicting’ a crypto-cyber unit was said to be the model for Bitcoin. It has even been speculated that Satoshi Nakomoto, the founder of Bitcoin, was not a single person but a workgroup of cryptologists, perhaps an arm of the NSA itself.

But the true purpose of cryptocurrency would not be discovered until several years after the introduction of Bitcoin. The introduction of crypocurrency was not for scientific reasons but political ones.

Governments around the world, particularly in the US, figured they could collect taxes far more efficiently if all funds could be traced from their origin. Money laundering and tax evasion would be severely reduced. More importantly, *every transaction could be taxed* in the form of a ""transaction fee"" imposed every time someone does something with their money.

People were used to paying transaction fees back then. Once the markets were regulated the transaction fees went up a couple of notches but most users didn't seem to mind. It was a small sacrifice for a kind of service that actually saved them from larger fees at their banks or with their credit cards.

Soon cryptocurrencies were a part of every market in every corner of the globe. Foreign currency turnover alone was over  $2,000,000,000,000,000 per year (2 thousand trillion USD) back then. Governments figured a small % of this would be *more* than was then collected in taxes. Derivatives markets was an even bigger piece of the pie. Stocks, commodities, consumer goods, and every other market soon followed.

Governments figured that $5 trillion a year in New Taxes could be generated from a 0.25% transaction fee on national currency transactions alone. An additional $35 trillion in New Taxes could be generated yearly from imposing this fee on all other transaction types. The US was a first-mover, and this allowed it to get the lion's share of worldwide taxes.

With the 2017 abolishment of federal and state income tax for both individuals and businesses, the US economy exploded. Although there was a 1% tax on savings, people felt much more confident and worked harder and spent more than they did before.

The plan worked. And fall of the Second Roman Empire was put off for at least another generation or two.",cryptocurrency,1392872193

It was a cold January morning when Jonny Benjamin, 26, after being diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder was standing at the edge of Waterloo Bridge wearing a mere t-shirt. It was strange for Neil Laybourn for a person with no suicidal tendencies would display a feat like that, so he intervened.
Laybourn, 31, narrates, ""I walked up around him and just calmly approached him and I said: 'Hi mate, can you tell me why you're sitting on the bridge?' and he told me that he was going to take his life that day. We just went from there, I just kept asking him questions and wanted to engage him and that if he wanted to talk I was there,"" Neil also mentioned, “Mr Benjamin said he had gone to the bridge after feeling his life had hit ‘rock bottom’.”    
They talked about going to get a cup of coffee but the police overtook the situation and Jonny never got a chance to thank Neil or that cup of coffee. Six years later, Jonny finally tracked down his saviour by a #FindMike Twitter search campaign he started that was shared around the globe and reached Laybourn. After meeting Benjamin states to have felt ‘elated’
He said: ""When I went to the bridge I was so embarrassed about what I was going through, I couldn't tell anyone, but that simple act of telling Neil and having him listen made all the difference.""

Estate Agent turns into a knight in shining armour!

Estate Agent, Jamie Clement, during a sale’s negotiation felt that his client had suddenly started to cough and upon asking if he was alright had turned quiet. The client (willingly anonymous) had a history of heart diseases in his family and had previously had a stroke. 
Jamie Clement, who works at Express Estate Agency (http://www.expressestateagency.co.uk/) on Oxford Street, Manchester, felt that his client was unwell. He repeatedly asked about his health and the client told him that he had pains in his chest, jaw and left arm. Jamie immediately recognized it as a heart attack and despite his client’s resistance convinced him to call for help. 
Clement says, “It could have been quite nasty, it could have been fatal and I wasn’t prepared to have that on my watch. I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself,”
Later when the client was helped and restored to health he stated, “I didn’t want to make a fuss but Jamie made me realise it was serious and I should get treatment immediately. I cannot thank him enough really. I had been trying to ignore the signs but he was so concerned I knew I had to do something. He went above and beyond what many others would have done and showed that he cared, for which we are very grateful.”

Like the rest of the MtGox / Bitcoin community, I am following the news and announcements but not really getting anywhere, so I decided to yahoo some things...   (haha, I prefer not to use google as a verb, so I yahoo'd it!) 

It is possible that Mark is innocent and did no wrong other than let the insane amount of Bitcoins in the live wallet be vulnerable enough to cause the freezing of withdrawels at MtGox...  just thinking out loud.  But then again, if there was a heist, we'd probably be told about that...   So, we can rest assured everything is safe?  I think not.

If someone is running a fraud or scam through MtGox, they have succeeded and it's too late.  The Feds or whoever are surely all over thier asses(&amp; assets) and slapped gag orders on them, which could be why he refuses to talk to the security breach team of 3 protesting outside the Old Offices....

dogecoin,"Shibe-onomics Vol. 5: Talking about fiat part 3 - advantages of fiat, use of fiat, exchange rates","Dear Dogecoin community,

After a relaxing weekend it is time for me to continue my series on fiat money for you. This will be the last post on the topic of monetary economics for now, but I think it's a topic that is the foundation for you shibes to understand how different currencies interact and what their properties are.

All previous posts are up on /r/shibeonomics if you want to look at what I wrote previously

____

Now let's get to the questions about fiat that I promised you to answer:

* ~~Why is it called fiat money?~~
* ~~When was fiat money first used?~~
* ~~How does fiat money retain its value?~~
* ~~Where does fiat money come from?~~
* What advantages does fiat money have?
* Why are all reserve currencies fiat money?
* Is fiat money ""free""?
* Is fiat money stable?

4 down, 4 to go, but I hope to get through the last 4 in this post.

* What advantages does fiat money have?

I talked about the properties of fiat money, of money supply, of fractional-reserve banking, of the stabilizing role of central banks. However it is important to consider why modern economies even go through the hassle of dealing with fiat, if there is also so much potential for it to go wrong. That's why it is necessary to consider the implications of using fiat not only on a national but also on a global scale.

Before fiat the most widespread money was the gold-standard, which is basically just a way to say that it was representative money based on gold. Now, if we look at a closed economy, an imaginary nation that is totally cut off and has now outside trade, what do we expect to happen if it uses a system of representative money:

The gold supply is fixed in the short term. We can even assume that all natural reserves of gold have been mined, because the addition of mining does not actually yield a lot of explanatory value but can confuse the points that are important. That means the gold supply is even fixed in the long term. If we declare that each bill is worth a certain amount of gold, it becomes clear, that as soon as the economy grows, deflation sets in. in a fixed monetary supply, a growing economy means that prices have to fall.

This has a couple of implications: It means that debt is very expensive and that capital owners profit not only from the interest, but also from the deflation. There are in general, two types of interest rate: nominal and real. This holds true for both inflation and deflation. The nominal interest rate is what the creditor charges for a loan, for example 5% per annum. The real interest rate however is the sum of the nominal interest rate and the rate of inflation/deflation. If prices fell by 5% in the same year, that loan turned from a nominal 5% interest rate into a real 10% interest rate. At the same rate, a price increase of 3% each year (a 3% inflation) means that the loan turns into a manageable 2% interest rate per year. The same holds true for the person giving out the loan: with deflation he can expect an increased real return, whereas with inflation the return on the loan is diminished.

If the money supply grows with the expanding economy, price stability can be maintained and the purchasing power of money remains roughly constant. Due to a phenomenon called ""[Nominal rigidity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity)"" (or sticky prices if you want to appear in the know;) ) it is believed that a certain small amount of inflation actually works best to ensure the continued productivity of labor and capital. That, and because it allows for a certain margin of error, is why central banks usually have an inflation target around 2% yearly inflation.

Another advantage of fiat money is that it allows for free-floating currencies. This means exchange rates are set by the market. This is not a necessity, as you may have heard the term of a ""[pegged currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate)"" or fixed exchange rate. If a currency is pegged to another currency, a so-called currency board makes sure that the in- and outflow of national and foreign currencies is balanced to maintain the desired target rate. The side-effect is that this makes monetary policy by setting interest rates ineffective or even pointless. Pegging a currency allows countries with a less mature financial system to benefit from the stable low inflation of another country. However large imbalances of payments in trade will have to be compensated to maintain the exchange rate. Sometimes this effort is aided by legal means (disallowing conversion at a rate different from the official one).

By now however, all countries have at least semi-free floating currencies, which means they target a band of exchange rates around which the currency may fluctuate, or fully free, like the USD or EUR. The positive effect on economic stability and predictability that can be attained by a fixed exchange rate, however, can be offset by the risk of a speculative attack on the currency. If you want to know more about that, you should read up on George Soros, also known as ""[The man who broke the Bank of England](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-bank-of-england.asp)"", whose actions led to the dissolution of the first system of fixed (albeit with a bandwith) european currencies which were pegged to the Deutschmark.

With a free-floating exchange rate, fiat currencies allow countries to influence domestic macroeconomic development through monetary policies via the interest rate. Imbalances in trade will be compensated by relative shifts in the exchange rate, a system that is impossible with the gold-standard or pegged-currencies. These systems will always be at risk of speculative attacks, which introduces unnecessary uncertainty into the markets and allows policy makers to impart shortsighted or uninformed goals into the monetary policy. A free-floating currency with an independent central bank allows countries to eliminate political biases from the monetary policy which serves to build trust in the markets.

* Why are all [reserve currencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency) fiat money?

I kind of answered that question already, but allow  me to expand a bit on that. Before the EUR, the Deutschmark, the French Franc and the Pound played a bigger role as reserve currencies (the pound still does), but by now we have a hierarchy of the USD first as biggest reserve currency with around 60%, the EUR with around 25%, then the GBP and JPY, followed by the Canadian and Australian Dollar and finally the Swiss Franc. The fact that these important economic centers have free floating currencies allows other countries to ""hedge"" their exposure to these markets. Hedging in economic terms means that you insure yourself against possible negative shocks that influence the markets. By having multiple interconnected free-floating reserve currencies, the risk of an economic downturn can be spread out and distributed so that they don't cause catastrophic damage.

Granted, in a global downturn, this function is limited, when there is a lot of covariance in the movement of major reserve currencies (minimizing covariance is important to consider when hedging, more on that some other time)., but still the relative impact will be distributed in the way the exchange rates move.

As you can see, this network of interconnected free-floating fiat currencies serves to insulate and buffer countries exposure to the risk of an economic downturn in another country. In a fixed exchange rate, a dollar crash would directly impact a country whose currency was pegged to the dollar, or force them to abandon the fixed exchange rate. 

The Fed and the ECB are powerful institutions, and they are scary. They make mistakes sometimes. But their work is trusted by governments all around the world, who place their trust in the economic foresight and stability a central bank system with fiat money brings. And all-in-all, it has proved to be an amazingly effective system in guaranteeing economic stability on a macroeconomic level both domestically and globally. While we are in an economic crisis, it has to be stated that the Great Depression was *WAY WORSE* for the countries that stayed in the gold-standard the longest. Countries who abandoned it and converted to a fiat-currency were able to whether the storm much more easily.

The system isn't perfect and it is constantly improved, but it is the best we can think of. No revolutionary new system will replace it, rather we will see an evolution in the role central banks play and the methods they can employ, to best serve the goal of providing clear and stable environments for the markets to prosper.

Sorry if I get a bit preachy here, but this is an important topic and particularly on reddit and some corners of the internet, there is a LOT of misinformation about the role and methodology of central banks. Don't be misled. Even if you just read the relevant wikipedia articles and click through from there you will be armed with the arguments to make the FUD disappear.

* Is fiat money ""free""?

This was a question I posed this provocatively on purpose. People say the Fed just ""prints money"" and that would make it worthless.

As you can see from my previous articles (especially the comments which I recommend going through for some more indepth discussion, the QE the Fed is doing didn't cause inflation yet. In fact, the money multiplier is at a historical low of 0.85! This is because the banks are preparing for new regulation called Basel 3 and are increasing their reserves. The QE serves to allow banks to build excess reserves beyond what is needed as security. It was needed to ensure that credit would still be available, because the banks were weary of lending, because they were unsure how many ""bad assets"" they were still holding.

Bitcoin,What do you do with bitcoin trolls?,"Here is the deal.

I don't really own any bitcoins (I did use trybtc.com)  I got into cryptocurrency because I thought dogecoin was fun and a mined some, purchased some and basically just sit on them now to see what happens.

My my posts on facebook were met with fierce opposition. Here is some of shit I have been arguing against.

* Bitcoin users are all Ron Paul loving libertarians who have fedoras and neckbeards.
* Most bitcoin fanatics are misogynistic (Stuff like this: https://twitter.com/bitcoin_txt/status/413448785419714564 sure makes it hard to argue this point)
* Bitcoin is a scam, pyramid scheme, a ponzi scheme, etc.
* Bitcoin is very unstable.
* Bitcoins value is derived and backed by nothing.
* Most people using bitcoin are criminals buying/selling drugs or just trying to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.
* Mining is a huge environmental waste of resources.

Here are some choice quotes from arguments I have been in recently:

&gt; ""I've explained my reasoning before. Some dude writes a program that effectively generates random numbers on a limited basis. he convinced a bunch of other people that those random numbers have value, and now he's a billionaire. I'm not sure how you can call it anything BUT a scam.""


&gt; ""It's just FOREX trade all over again.
Except there's no country with an actual currency involved. Instead, it's all monopoly money that a guy owns a huge share of that people are engaging in currency speculation with. That's why people mainly talk about mining and are obsessed with exchanges and transactions and the like.
All of the ""actually using it *as* a currency to pay for things"" is just some post hoc justification that a bunch of Fedoratarians are telling themselves is why their engagement in currency speculation is actually a noble effort to fight some sort of The Man or other.""


&gt; "" the creator of bitcoin engineered a system in which he had the OVERWHELMING ADVANTAGE in generating this new imaginary random number currency. When he started, his random number were worth *nothing*. He literally convinced people that his *strings of random numbers* had *real-money value*. That, in itself, is a scam. But more people kept joining the collective delusion that these strings of random numbers had value, so the value went up. Now, since he was in from the start, his scam has made him *ONE BILLION DOLLARS*. From doing nothing more than writing a program that generates random numbers.""


&gt;""The only reason bitcoin has value is because the collective delusion persists.""


&gt;"" There is no backing for bitcoin. There is merely the mathematical structure that says they're unique and verifiable, etc. That makes for a convenient method of currency transfer, but that doesn't make them valuable in and of themselves.
It's more like a debit card. We could have a system where debit cards functioned off bitcoins, but in the end it's just a proxy for money. Nobody wants the bitcoins, or they wouldn't give two shits about the exchanges. They want the real money equivalent of whatever the exchange price is. That's why they say things like ""invest in bitcoins"", as if it were gold, or pork bellies, or WTF ever.
But to make it valuable they need to convince other people it has utility, and then some people get caught up in that part of the scam the way people get caught up in Jonestown or Heaven's Gate or whatever.
It's just a more grognard attempt at the same thing as Flooz or Beenz""


&gt; ""Bitcoin is not a currency.
It's effectively a stock share for a company that doesn't exist. The major shareholder has an obvious vested interest in convincing people the stock is valuable, as do any other major holders.
This is why it can fluctuate wildly.
If someone tried to buy shit at walmart using fractional google shares, we'd say they were crazy. But that's exactly what people are trying to do with bitcoin.""


&gt; ""It's a ""currency"" sure. But it's not a ""real"" currency if it's only used by a few dozen thousand internet weirdoes.
It may progress past the novelty stage at some point, but for now it's just cyber beanie babies for self diagnosed asperger's syndrome cases.""


This is what I am defending against-- and I am doing my best. Sure, I can link the bitcoin wiki, the only owned and controlled by MtGox...Its really difficult to present that as evidence.
Worse yet are some of the people on reddit who's only mission is to shit on bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. Have a look at some of these user accounts:

Just a couple I found this morning while reading the Ben Lawsky AMA.

personalfinance,(USA) Looking for help reducing my tax burden through legal channels.,"Hello!  First, a little background - I am a pacifist/conscientious objector in the USA.  I refuse to support war in any way, including paying federal taxes while my country is at war.  I live a modest lifestyle and don't make much money - between my relatively low income and the fact that I am the sole breadwinner for my family, I've managed to keep my federal tax liability at 0.

However, this year I've received a job offer making substantially more income.  I want to take the job, but only if I can continue paying 0 in federal taxes (state taxes are okay, since they don't support war directly, though reducing that burden is always a plus).  I am willing to do whatever it takes (legally) to reduce my tax liability, such as charitable donations, gambling losses (ha) or whatever is necessary to pay nothing in taxes.

If it helps, I have one child and a wife - both tax dependents.  I do not own my home, but may this year.  My salary with this new job will be just under 100K, but there are bonuses as well and I'm not sure how much they'll be - could be between $0 and $60k.  Since this will be my first year, I can't really guess where that will fall.

Any help?  Thanks so much!  (And yes, this is a throwaway, but I'll be checking it often.)

investing,Find a flaw in my strategy of using monthly ETF dividend in order to pay interest on line of credit.,"Background:
My bank allows me to borrow up to 80% of the value of my home to split between a regular mortgage and a line of credit. So every month as I pay down some capital through my mortgage payment the line of credit is increased as much.

The line of credit carries an interest rate of 3%. To pay for it I’ve found two monthly paying dividend ETFs that together yield 3%. 

Because these ETFs provide good capital return potential on top of the regular dividend payment, I’m figuring this is as good as it gets. Line of credit interest is paid (and deductible to boot) by the dividends and all of the capital gain over time is all mine.

personalfinance,"Retirement Contributions, maxing out IRA's/457b etc","I keep seeing all these posts that say you should contribute 15-20% of your pay to retirement, but also ones saying you should max out IRA's etc, and it can get awfully confusing, so I'll post my scenario and see if I can get some feedback.

64k annual income for single income family of 4 (more kids planned). Take home pay after taxes and deductions is about $4,200 a month.
401(a) plan with $684.06 contributed a month (PERS plan, see below)
401(a) plan with $645.12 contributed a month (SBS plan, see below)
457b plan with optional contributions, currently not adding anything to it

The PERS 401(a) plan is the defined contribution retirement plan for employees. A certain percentage of pay is contributed and the employer matches 62.5%. There's no option to contribute more than the set amount.

The SBS 401(a) plan is in place of social security taxes. As a governmental employee in my State we do not pay into social security, but instead we pay into a supplemental annuity plan at 6.13% matched 100% by the employer. Basically instead of social security we have a separate defined contribution plan. That means I won't have anything in social security at retirement though.

457(b) plan: There's good investment options here, and the plan has low fees. I do have $3,700 in the plan, but am not actively contributing anything as of right now.

As I see it, with the mandatory SBS and mandatory PERS contributions, I'm contributing about $1,330 to retirement every month or about $16k annually. If I add the employer match on SBS and PERS to my gross income it would be about 71k, which means I'm contributing 22.5% (16/71) of my gross income into retirement without making additional contributions.

Should I be contributing to the 457(b) plan as well and not include the SBS contributions in my calculations since I have no social security in retirement? I have about $500 surplus a month that I can be using to either pay off student loans (3% interest rate) or house mortgage (3.5%), save up to replace my car with another beater, or place in the 457b. We have no credit card debt. I have about 1.5 months of expenses in cash that we keep in checkings at all time, and I have accrued vested leave that covers another 1.5 months of expenses. I also have long term and short term disability insurance and a very secure job and extremely employable experience (will have my CPA by the end of 2014), so the need for a full 6 months emergency fund doesn't feel as needed for me. Maybe that's a mistake on my part though?

Also, I am expecting about a $300 take home pay raise in the next couple months, so the $500 will jump to $800.",finance,1392932332

When I moved away from home to study I saw how the better half lives. I became envious and suddenly money was the only thing I cared about. Feeling lost and scared I didn't know what to do. Drowning in student loans, barely managing school, unable to find a job anywhere. Then DogeCoin appeared. What I thought was a joke and scoffed at, became something more to me. You see, its not about getting rich from DogeCoin, its about the community it has created for me. It birthed a community of people who where mostly concerned with giving back, donating, charity, pretty much all the good stuff you can do with money. As I read more and more into cryptocurrencies and DogeCoin itself I've found something that can pull me through everything. Hope. Now even though I know I probably won't ever make a lot of money from DogeCoin (as I can't mine and well, how high could this thing go? TO THE MOON OFC) I still hope for something. I've given myself a drive. Learning about cryptocurrencies even at the slow rate that I do, I feel a lot better. I promise myself that one day I'll be the top of my game in the Computer Science industry and hopefully one day I can become as generous as some of the people here on /r/DogeCoin. I hope my ramblings make sense, I just felt the need to say something. Thank you so much.

Bitcoin,Bitcoins and Federal Audits…? How does it work?,"Hello /r/bitcoin, I appreciate the advice on how to start setting up a bitcoin donation service. I am a Family Nurse Practitioner that had posted previously about meeting with management to setup a bitcoin donation as a way to help our underserved population clinic with some medical services while we wait to become a federal qualified health center. They were receptive to the idea, but there is confusion as to how audits would work, especially with the fluctuation of bitcoin pricing and etc.

Can any of you provide any insight? This is all very new, exciting but also confusing as you can imagine. If the process ends up in more complexity it was discussed it may be easier to just setup donations through a personal account and writing a direct donation (in USD) to the clinic which would be more familiar in the auditing process. Thank you again.",cryptocurrency,1392942804
personalfinance,At what interest rate should you decide to pay a loan back faster vs moving the extra money to an investment account and investing it?,"I've heard from a lot of people that the cutoff is around 3.5%. What if our house loan is at 3.75%? Should we use the extra earnings each month to pay off the house faster or should we just continue to use it to invest? Not sure how to determine which choice is *really* best for us.

personalfinance,Refinance or not?,"Hi R/PF, 

I need advice on a proper way to handle my current debt situation. 
I am in the military (enlisted) but have prior student loans that I am paying back. I have about 15000 in debt:

1) $4,500 @ 6% fedloan

2) $5,500 @ 6% fedloan

3) $4,800 @ 6% private


I have a ~750 credit score. Currently in the bank I have for emergency fund ~3k and I am slowly trying to build it. 
I am married and live in base housing and currently expecting my first child. I contribute to TSP Roth and its deducted before I ever see it (10% of my base pay) . My SO is currently a full time student and will stay home with the child. SO has no debt due to military benefits (Tuition assistance scholarships act) but has some royalties that come in and add to our income. Last year was ~3,500 and will probably continue +/- 500.
Our total monthly income that we can depend on is ~ $1,400

Expenses: 

Internet/Cable- $94 

Gas- $100

Cell phone- $100

Groceries- $400

Baby Supplies- $100 (This is our budgeted amount for diapers/wipes/?)

Student Loan 1&amp;2- $150 (individual payments are 62/74 its combined billing)

Student Loan 3- $131 

Car Insurance- $84

Netflix- $15

Emergency Fund Allotment- $100

~TOTAL= $ 1,273 

My question is would refinancing benefit me for those loans? Currently I get a ding on my credit report for having so many installment loans. As you can see we don't really have a lot of wiggle room with our budget. What is a feasible way of paying down these loans? I am unsure how refinancing would impact our interest, would I qualify for a lowered interest rate? Any advice would be appreciated on how to make changes or what to pursue as far as debt consolidation or if I should even pursue it.",finance,1392949082
hardware,1440p X-Star Monitor Unboxing and Review (with pics! and cats!!),"Hey guys!  I'm here to do a little review and unboxing of my new Korean X-Star 27"" 1440p Monitor.  I’ve seen quite a few posts on here and [r/monitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/monitors) asking some questions and I hope this post will help you guys out.  Now I just got this monitor yesterday, and only been about to really mess with it for around 2-3 hours today (I’ll explain later on why) but I'm here to give you guys a little buyers guide, review, and thoughts about it thus far.  I purchased this monitor from dream-seller via eBay on Fri, Feb 15 and it arrived yesterday the 19th.

*DISCLAIMER* I am by no means a hardware/monitor expert.  I'm a long time computer tweaker and tinkerer.  I don't have a formal IT background but have built my last 3 or so systems.  Therefore, I will use layman's terms and may not be able to answer all of your technical questions.  I will, though, try my best and, as always, Google is your best friend when it comes to answering stuff.

Be understanding of the phone quality photos and the poor lighting in my computer room please!  But without further ado, here she is! 

[ X-Star Monitor](http://imgur.com/a/hckEE)

Like I said, I ordered this monitor off of eBay from the one and only dream-seller ([actual link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/330932578190?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649)).  I guess you could say that this is the ""bottom tier"" of their monitors.  Each tier offers something a little bit better from the one below it with the catch of $20-$30 more on the sale price.  At the bottom you can have 1-5 dead pixels and backlight bleed (all the tiers are pretty much guaranteed some backlight bleed), the second is 1-3 dead pixels, and the top being no dead pixels at all.  I read several reviews that the tier system is pretty much a ""scam"" and that many of the bottom tier monitors come with maybe only 1 or no dead pixels at all, and very minimal backlight bleed.  

As you can tell from the link, I decided to roll the dice and go with the bottom tier.  And as far as I can tell, doing several dead pixel tests, I haven’t found one.  Not saying that I won't come across one later but in my minimal time with the monitor I haven't come across any.  Now for backlight bleed.  There is noticeable bleed in the bottom left and right corners.  I have read articles online that there are ways of fixing this by taking off the bezel and ""tightening"" things up a bit.  But I really don't see any use for this.  The bleed I have on my monitor is negligible and to be honest I could really care less.  

I had several interactions with dream-seller throughout my purchase.  I initially messaged him on Fri night right after my purchase to let him know I'd be more than willing to assist him in whatever he needs (customs fees, additional addresses, shit like that) to get my monitor to me in a reasonable amount of time.  To be honest this was just a ploy and I was trying to win some brownie points in the hopes that I may get a better product (shallow, I know..).  I was returned with an automated response saying that they were out for the weekend and I'd get an official response come Mon.  Come Sun night I get a response from dream-seller telling me how thankful he was for my purchase and that if there are any issues he'll be sure to message me asap.  I sent him another message Mon morning asking why my delivery date was pushed back a week and if there was a problem.  He quickly responded that there wasn't and proceeds to copy and paste the most recent tracking info via FedEx and say I should have it within a day or so.  Lo and behold it was delivered Wed morning at the desired address.  

**The TL;DR version of this is: dream-seller is a legit eBay seller.  He seems to truely care about his business and his customers.  He's an A+ seller in my book.  He got back to me promptly, clearly, and I would definitely recommend this guy to anyone who will listen.**

Now time for my one and only gripe throughout this entire process.  Posted one the page is the notice of ""FREE SERVICE"".  And under that, it states that you'll get a free adapter with your purchase, a quality test, and free shipping.  All of those are true but if you fail to mention it to them that you need an adapter via message, you won't get one.  I naively assumed that since I was ordering from the US I would just get one, but nope.  I had to go out to Best Buy and buy one for $10.  I also messaged him about this and he said that when you order you're supposed to message them and tell them that you'll need said adapter for whatever country you live in.  If this is the only ""bad"" thing (if you could really even call it that) that happened throughout my entire purchase then I call it a definite win.  Hell, I needed a new surge protector anyway.  If it sounds like I'm bitching, I'm sorry.  I just want to give prospective buyers a heads up.

All in all, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  I was on the fence for a while about buying one of these monitors and I can honestly say that I can mark it up in the win column.  Dream-seller is offering a quality product for an awesome price.  I will state that it is **no guarantee** what you'll get though.  I have heard good things about his return policy, even going as far as paying for you to ship it back over to Korea.   

So yeah, this is my experience with buying one of these Korean Monitors.  Like I said, this by no means guarantees you a perfect monitor on the lower tier.  I just got lucky I guess but it seems like my experience is the norm rather than the exception.  Regardless, feel free to ask any questions you have or anything you want to know.  I'm more than willing to help.  And happy monitor shopping!",technology,1392950265
personalfinance,shopping for a new car and was just offered a pretty good deal (I think),"so here is my situation. Apologies for the length.

37 year old grad student, my primary debt is student loans, I have had a few write-offs and I currently have one debt on my report that seems shady (that is another story). My credit is not good, rating is right around 600.

I currently drive a '07 Suzuki, which is paid off. It may be worth 4500 probably more like 4000. I spent $1300 on repairs last year. Repairs are crazy expensive since they no longer sell the car in the US. I would prefer not to have a car payment but I am worried that it will need more repairs and I just don’t think its worth putting any more money into it.

I have been living primarily off of student loans for the last two years, exclusively for about 4 months after getting laid off. I currently have around $4500 in cash on hand from loans and I am scheduled to have another $7000 in excess loan money this summer (my final semester in grad school).

I have been working a regular job for the last 2 months, the money is not great. I am making $2,000 a month after taxes, insurance, and 401K. I feel like I have room to move up in the company or once I graduate should be able to find a position where I make more money by the end of the year.

So finally I will get to the point. I have been looking for a new car as I am afraid that my current one will break down or require some repairs soon that will be prohibitively expensive. Tonight I went to take a look at a certified pre-owned civic, decent price only 8K miles, will carry a warranty for several years. The price is pretty good ($16850). They will give me $3500 for my trade in and I can put down $3000 in (student loan) cash. This will require 72 monthly payments of $320.

After rejecting that offer the salesman countered with a brand new civic at a price of $21,605. With a cash down payment of $3k and a trade in of $3500 the monthly payments would actually be less running me $305 for 72 months. 

Am I an idiot for putting student loan money at 6% towards a car loan at 10%?

Am I falling for car dealer trickery?

I am rationalizing this for the following reasons.

Overall I will be paying a slightly lower interest rate by paying student loan money toward a car

My credit will improve if I pay these loan payments on time and pay it off quickly
The resale price and longevity of a civic is a solid investment when compared to other cars

So reddit, I would love some good reasons not to buy this car, I would also love for you to tell me I am making perfect sense (fingers crossed)

Apologies if there are grammatical or formatting errors, I am tired and I have had 3 beers.",finance,1392950786

investing,A Quick Analysis on Franklin Resources (BEN) and a Morningstar Article on Their Management and funds (TPINX) (FKINX).,"Hello All,

I found an interesting article about their history, management, and quick fund analysis from Morningstar.  Interesting enough, I couldn't actually find it on Morningstar's website itself:

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/franklin-templeton-sticks-knitting-120000909.html

Currently, I am looking to overweight my portfolio to financials as interest rates will rise over the next 5 years and asset qualities improve on a broad base.  I have been in FKINX for over 5 years and consistently add to it as our income allocation in the portfolio.  I am very pleased with the fund's performance.

On top of owning the mutual fund, I am going to add their parent company, Franklin Resources (BEN) to my portfolio. This will ensure I have the full financial market exposed: Traditional Bank (WFC), Investment Bank (JPM), Insurance (BRK.B), Credit Cards (V), and now Asset Management (BEN).    

BEN is one of the Dividend Aristocrats as they have raised their dividend each year since 1981.  Over the past 10 years, the company has only seen two years in which revenues declined from the previous year, one of which was the financial crisis.  Book value has increased every year over the past 10 years.

The firms Assets Under Management (AUM) saw an increase of 12.45% over last year which ended in an all time high.  They have had an increase of AUM every year over the past 5 years.

**Assets Under Management**

* 2013: $845b
* 2012: $750b
* 2011: $660b
* 2010: $645b
* 2009: $523b

Not only has their AUM consistently improved, they have a great mix of assets. As of 2013 their asset mix consisted of 40% Equity, 43% Fixed Income, 16% Hybrid and 1% Cash Management.  

As per the Morningstar Article, it shows how the management team, through Franklin, Templeton, and Mutual further diversify the asset base into different strategies. 

Valuation by Multiples is consistent with their long term average and slightly lower than last year.  Other than the financial crisis, it appears BEN has traded around the current range in both PE and BV/Share.  

In conclusion, Franklin Resources is a great slow but steady firm that has a tight management team and a diversified asset base.  Over the long term, BEN and their funds should create enormous value for their shareholders.",finance,1392955760

personalfinance,"With tax return season, how should you go about paying debt?","I'm in debt, something that has slowly accumulated over the past year or so and am wondering, now that I have an extra influx of cash coming in, where I should pay it off first.

I have three credit cards with the same interest rate, 18% each with $1,000 on them.

My other debt is an auto loan totaling at $4,800 at a lower interest rate (11%).

Now, because I can choose to pay what I want on the credit cards and allocate more resources towards paying the set rate for my car, paying it off faster freeing up $350/month should I do that? 

Or just pay off the higher interest rate credit cards? The auto loan was a 2 year deal where I put 45% down on the car. 


I'm 20 years old and this stuff is pretty new to me, which is why I'm managing so poorly, although I know I could be worse off. 

Income is about $2,100/month with most of that going to bills, I'll admit, I have been living beyond my means and I'm trying to change that. 

My old vehicle should be selling here pretty quick for about $2,000 so I will have more money to help get out of debt.

Thanks for the help!

I can post more info if need be. I'm on mobile right now while at work.",finance,1392961158

personalfinance,Talk me out of this lease (and other advise),"Edit: I've had enough abuse, I came here for blunt reasons for why I shouldn't do this and that's what I got. The lease won't be happening. I'm a materialistic 20-something and sometimes I need smart people to talk me out of stupid, large financial moves and this sub never fails. Sorry if I'm frustrating! Thanks to everyone who took the time to write, even if you were mean about it (especially if you were mean about it, actually).

You all brilliantly talked me out of buying a house some months ago so I'm back for more of the same--talk me out of this. I know it's a bad move, but I want it...

Here's the situation. I'm 24, make about $2,900 per month take home. I have a large chunk of federal student debt that I pay $312/month that will be forgiven in about 9 years (I have a cushy non-profit job). 80% of that comes back to me on taxes (it's all interest, above the line deductible) so really amounts to little of nothing per year. Only other long term debt is private student loans, on which I'm paying about half my take home towards and will be gone in a little less than a year. No credit card debt, about $100 into saving per month. TI-AA CREF only retirement at the moment, doesn't come out of pay.

I have a car payment, $285/month (only other debt). 2012 fully loaded Ford Fusion I bought gently used in August at about 1/2 value ($16,000 over 60 months). I wanted to lease a better car but drove too much at the time, now I drive about 8 miles a day. 

The lease in question: a fully loaded 2014 Impala. I freaking love this car and I want it. I can lease it, easily. Stellar credit and plenty of expendable income (that will cut slightly into my private student loan payments, realistically). Payments will be about $325, $10/month increase in insurance. The Fusion is appraised at about even on what I owe for it, so at most a $500 loss there. 

How bad of a move is this and why are leases bad in general, those are my two questions. 

Also, in the vein of general advise, what should I be doing right now differently in general? Anything pop out at you? I think I live well within my means, but am I wrong about this?

Any advise is appreciated. Sway me with facts and figures because I want this car. Like, I really freaking want it and I love cars. It's my weak spot.",finance,1392993711

At my old job, I had a 403b that I rolled over to a vanguard roth IRA once I left.  I received a 1099-R from the old fund that specified the State/Payer's state no. as Ohio (line 13).  

My question is do I owe Pennsylvania taxes on this rollover in addition to Federal and State of Ohio?",finance,1393000565
personalfinance,"Discovered I have savings bonds in my name. Cash in all, some, or none?","Quick facts: I'm 23, no debt, renting an apartment.  Maxed out Roth IRA for this year.  Contributing to employer 401k.  Extra money goes to taxable brokerage account with Vanguard.  Mostly stocks since I'm none, but a little chunk in a bond fund to serve as a potential start to a down payment on a house (not on the horizon, but within 3-7 years maybe).  

About half of the bonds that were purchased later have an interest rate of 0.65%-1.19% while the other half have interest rates at 4.00%.  None of them have reached their maturity, the closest being about 6 years away.

I'm thinking I should cash in the ones earning that very low rate now correct?  That's not even beating inflation?

But what about the 4.00% ones?  Should I put them into a mutual fund now?

Keep in mind I do not need any of this money now.  I'm mainly focused on getting as big of a nest egg as I can now while I'm young and my expenses are low, so that when my expenses do go up (house, kids), I'll have a pretty good start to sit back and watch that interest compound.

personalfinance,Sallie Mae didn't notify about loan deferment/interest rate rise,"Hi all,

This is more of a rant but maybe some of you have experience with this and can tell me if it's pretty normal.  Last month (Jan) I noticed that my interest rate on my student loan went up from 3.65 to 3.88%.  I know I should have called immediately to inquire about it, which is completely my fault, but I just assumed that it was an appropriate raise based on some law that Congress passed while I was out drinking or something.  

Then Sallie Mae missed my automatic payment for February entirely, so I just called.  I try to make extra payments every month so I didn't notice the missing auto-payment immediately.  As is turns out, I'm taking a couple of classes at a community college this term and my school informed Sallie Mae about this.  Sallie Mae then automatically deferred my loans until May 2018 and raised my interest rate to 3.88% -- all without notifying me.  No emails, no letters, nothing.  I think that poor customer service guy just wanted me off the phone fast -- the deferment was immediately lifted, the interest rate dropped, and the extra interest for Jan was refunded.  

I've looked all over their site for information that says ""we can defer your loans and raise your rate without telling you"" but I see nothing. 

Anyway, I just wanted to pass that along as a lesson learned.  Be careful if you decide to take a class, watch your interest rate, and be aware that they can, and will, make big changes to your loan without telling you.",finance,1393001342
personalfinance,Will paying extra on my student loans weekly (vs. monthly) result in any worthwhile interest savings?,"Hey, PF. I've been reading a little bit about making bi-weekly or weekly payments towards your loans instead of monthly, because that helps you squeeze in an extra payment each year to pay the loan down faster.  
  
My situation is a little different. I have 4 student loans that total up to roughly 27k currently, all at 6.55%. My montly payment is ~$370/mo, which I have set up for automatic debit. On top of that, I pay anywhere from $500-$600 extra, depending on what my budget that month allows. I don't really care about breaking up my monthly payment into bi-weekly ones to get the ""extra payment"", since I'm consistently making these extra payments (and I get an interest rate reduction with auto-debit payments).  
  
I typically make that extra payment on the last day of the month. Would it be better for me to pay, say, ~$100 weekly so the loan is continuously getting smaller and thus accumulating less interest? Or is the interest savings from this so negligible that it doesn't matter?",finance,1393001901
personalfinance,What's my next move? Advice is appreciated!,"You all just talked me out of something extraordinarily stupid, but now I'm thinking about finances. I'm OK with money management, but I had an epiphany this afternoon and maybe I'm not as knowledgeable as I think I am. Let me describe to you my current financial situation, and if you all could give me opinions on what my next move should be I'd be forever grateful.

**Take home income:** $2,900

**Necessary Spending:**

*Rent, bills:*                                   $520

*Other necessary (gas, groceries):*  $300

*Car and insurance:*                       $410 ($285 for car, 55 months to go)


**All other discretionary spending:**

*Eating out, video games, etc.*        $200

*Private student loan payments*      $1250 (minimum, $65) will be paid off in 10 months


**Savings:**

*Whatever is left*                           ~$200

**Other facts:**

-Excellent credit

-No credit card debt

-TI-AA CREF set up, about $4,500 a year going into that

-Savings equal to about $3,000 currently

-The big question: $67,000 in federal student loan debt (for two degrees, Biomed undergrad BS degree and an MBA)

  *Will be using ""pay-as-you-earn income based repayment plan*

  *Start paying October 2014 (can't waive grace period), $312/month*

  *All federal loans qualify*

  *Total forgiveness in ten years (120 payments, so October 2024) without being taxed on payoff amount because I work for a 501(c)3*

  *$312 payments will be all interest aka not touching the principle ($3,750 per year, $2,500 back on taxes above the line deductible)*

**Questions:** 

-Am I correct in paying back private loans as quickly as possible? Combined interest about 5.5% per year.

-Is this income-based repayment a good move? I shouldn't actually attempt to pay that balance back on a standard 10 year plan, correct? Technically possible last I looked, the worst possible option.

-Overall, what's my next move? Pay the car off? Save? Invest?

-Lastly, I see people on here writing things like ""if you didn't spend that, you could invest and make $xxxxxx more dollars."" Pragmatically, *what does this mean?* If I have extra cash, should I save it or invest? Where do I invest it to get good, secure returns?

-When should I consider buying a house? Or should I not consider it at all in the near future? (This sub talked me out of it a few months ago).

I want to compartmentalize the federal loans and forget about them. After the $2,500 coming back on my taxes, it amounts to a $90 per month payout in order to get complete forgiveness in ten years. I want to set up the payments to automatically withdraw and forget about it entirely and pretend it isn't there. I think I got two useful degrees out of that money, but I still hate the necessity of that debt. 

Also, I work for a university so 100% free, unlimited tuition. Should I go for another Master's degree, and if so, what? Over half done with an accounting degree thanks to the overlap from the MBA, is this a bad idea? Should I try for a doctorate?

personalfinance,Buying a house with parents: bad idea?,"I think I will end up talking to an actual accountant about this eventually, but the plan is currently in its early stages and I thought /r/pf might have some good advice/critiques.  I'm considering purchasing a house together with my parents, and I'm wondering what the potential pitfalls might be, and how to best arrange the transaction. 

**Background details**:  My parents are both recently retired and both have generous, reliable federal government pensions. They own their house outright, and their pensions alone are enough for them to live comfortably on.  They also have a good amount of individual retirement savings, as well as a recent inheritance in the mid-six figures.  They have high credit scores and are generally responsible with money.  

I am 27, and I rent an apartment about an hour away from them in the nearest big city.  I have a professional degree and a relatively high and stable income for my age.   I paid off all my student loans and have around $100k saved in taxable accounts, plus a bit in 401k.  My credit score is excellent.  (For what it's worth, I recognize that I am incredibly lucky to be in this position - both individually and with my family.  I do not take my good fortune for granted.)

I am saving up to buy a house on my own, but real estate in my area is very expensive, and I will realistically not be able to afford a house alone for many years.  That's fine with me.  I was/am prepared to wait several years if necessary, but I do very much look forward to owning a home.

**The plan**: My parents just received an inheritance, and they will have no need for that money in the foreseeable future.  They are a bit shy to make any more large stock market investments at this stage in their lives.  They decided that real estate might be the most comfortable place to park the inheritance money for the time being.  The initial plan was for them to purchase and rent out a house in an up-and-coming area that is likely to go up in value.  But then they realized they do not really want the hassle of being landlords, and they're not necessarily savvy enough to speculate on real estate prices.  

So, they've offered to purchase a house with me.  By that I mean, they have offered to put down a substantial down payment (30-50%) on a house that we would co-own, and I would live in.  I would pay the mortgage/taxes/up-keep and all other ongoing costs.  We would split equity proportionally based on the ratio of their initial investment to the initial valuation of the house.  I would either plan to buy them out eventually, or split the profit/loss with them proportionally when we eventually sell the house.

As a personal matter, my parents and I get along fairly well. We are all reasonable and responsible. My parents view this both as a prudent (conservative) financial investment, and a as nice way to help their daughter.  I can't imagine that there would be any major conflicts between us as co-owners.  The worst possibility I can think of is them wanting to visit too much, or my dad trying to play handy-man with things that are beyond his expertise.  Those are both problems I can live with.

I could afford the mortgage and carrying costs of the house very comfortably.  The areas I am looking to buy in are very popular.  The houses are expensive - not the kind of property with a huge investment upside, but also unlikely to go down too much.  My parents are able to tolerate some losses on the investment, though I think that is unlikely to happen.

**My question for r/pf is, is this a bad idea?  Are there things that could go wrong in this arrangement that I haven't thought of? What would be the most tax efficient way to set this up?**",finance,1393004386

Let's say you are a physician/lawyer earning 150k/yr, and manage to save essentially all of your post-tax income (75k/yr).  Assuming 30 years of post-residency practice, you will only be saving 2.25 million dollars.  This is ignoring the 200-300k of student loan debt you'll be taking on, and oh yeah living expenses.  Yes I know this is ignoring savings compounding, but guess what, that will just increase the number of the 1% too.

100- Cell Phone

She makes a VERY small amount from a part time job that we're sticking in savings to make loan payments if she isn't able to find a job immediately after graduation.

personalfinance,Started a company (pass-through)... interesting dilemma.,"I started a company last year that did about $200k in sales and probably turned about a $50k profit at the end of the year. This is a side company on top of my fulltime salary job ($~50k). Since the company is new, I needed to keep all of the profit in the bank as working capital. 

Since the company is passthrough, I'm going to end up owing taxes on half of that (Business partner has the other 50%). That leaves me with about $25k extra income that is currently untaxed. Assuming the total tax after state/ss/medi/payroll/fed is ~45%, I will owe about $11k in taxes. 

I assume standard procedure is to take that amount out of the company account to pay it, but could I also take $17k out of the bank and put it all into a 401k, thus reducing my tax burden by almost the entire $25k and also putting that payout to good use?

Bitcoin,PANIC HOARD!!!,"This is my BTC strategy going forward. As it should be everyone else in this community. Pick a number, any number that you'd feel comfortable ""getting out"" at. For some it may be a measly million dollars. For the more creative a billion. If you can get your BTC for cheap, don't pass it up. Long gone are the days of penny, nickel, and dollar bitcoins. There's a certain threshold that this community absolutely refuses to go under, and we should all strive to make one another richer from this social experiment. If you truly understand the underlying mechanisms behind Bitcoin, and really every ""crypto-currency"", these are technologies that empower the individual. I've made similar posts in the past about how this technology will fundamentally change how humans conceive of ""money"" going forward. We are literally in the very embryonic stages of this technology. There will be rapid rises, and panic falls, but over time, you have to come to the realization that Bitcoin is here to stay. Not only is it here to stay, but one day this technology will enable us to solve problems on a global scale much more rapidly, efficiently, and practically than ever before. Imagine if you will for a moment, your favorite travel destination has been the unfortunate benefactor of a ""natural disaster"". We here in the cryptocurrency community can come together, and collectively donate to alleviate some of their burdens. This is already happening in the Dogecoin community. One day there will be a spike so high upwards, and it will be THE game changer. One really smart businessman will realize the profound impact this technology will have all across this planet. He'll be the ""seeder"". Really any of us who hold anything in BTC are ""seeders"", but in this case this person will buy up a large enough portion of the blockchain, let's say 2.1 million bitcoins, and during this time, the holders who are really finicky, they'll sell. You know why they'll sell, because they'll see perhaps a 1000%-5000% return on their investment, and think ""this is too good too be true"", and for a time, they will have a profound impact on their local community, because of all this brand new capital being introduced. When this technology scales up to the point that it is legitimately a threat to entrenched banking establishments, it WILL be too late. You are now your own bank. This is a possibility that I firmly believe will be very real, because this technology is already being fed from multiple currencies all over the world. It won't happen overnight, but it will happen very fast. MtGox needs to do the right thing, and permit withdrawals again. As one of the first major players in the Bitcoin space, they would deal this technology a severe blow by not honoring the trust that was placed in them. They, as a corporate entity, might not have the complacency to truly acknowledge and respect their own power, but Bitcoin will survive regardless of company x, y, or z's failures. What this community needs now more than ever is confidence. Confidence that they have complete control over their own money. Confidence that their holdings in this collective will appreciate over time, and that any setbacks, or ""bubbles"", will be temporary. This technology is about empowering the common person. We as a species need to reclaim our future. We can't expect that the corporate global elitist will bail us out, however we now have the power to bail one another out. We've been thinking about money the wrong way this whole time. The accumulation of money for one's self is at the core of the human experience today. We need to redefine ourselves, and our relationship to money in a fundamental way. For the first time, we can raise the standard of living for all humans on this planet, not marginally, but fundamentally. This community is global already, and we have a chance to truly change this world. This might be our only shot. Let's make this shit count.

personalfinance,Investing my savings in a European fund (in euros)...?,"I hope this is not too generic a question: I have scoured the archives and it seems the bulk of posts in this area are only applicable to US funds/US residents/US dollars...

I am looking to invest some of my savings in a fund with slightly better returns than what your average savings account gets you nowadays (of course, that's after setting aside an emergency fund in a safe, low-return, easily-accessed account).

My savings are in USD, yen and euros, with my preference going strongly toward investing the latter, in the latter's economic zone:

- Japanese local interest rates hovers under 0, investment returns are heavily taxed and I have zero confidence in the longterm financial future of the country.

- US laws unfortunately make it quite difficult to invest anything in the US without holding residence.

- I have dual citizenship between euro countries, while residing abroad, and should be able to freely invest in some of the less tax-heavy countries dealing in euros (Luxembourg...). I also happen to think euro (and most euro funds) are slightly undervalued, especially compared to Asian ones.

And therefore my question is... **how could I go about placing my euro savings in an investment:**

- with a €10,000-€20,000 initial deposit. Adding more as I go.

- view to the long-term (10+ years) but potentially available after a couple years (down-deposit for a house?).

- average risk/return, i.e: better yearly return than a savings account, but low-to-nonexistent chances of losing capital, short of another worldwide 2008-style crash (willing to bet against that for the next 5-10 years).

And, quite importantly:

- that can be opened and managed **remotely** (online) from anywhere in the world. As I do not live in Europe at the moment and do not plan to travel to Luxembourg or elsewhere, every time I want to make a deposit.

Any tip or advice on the right fund/country/investment company?",finance,1393052769

Full disclosure: I understand that there is no correct answer, and each person needs to evaluate for themselves the risk/reward factor of investments versus the guaranteed return on paying a loan off (plus the tax break for student loans/etc) - but thought this might spark a good discussion and/or be a decent reference for people without a clue on where to start.

Personally, I'm going very conservative and am paying down all of my loans with an interest rate greater than 3%. I chose that number because, since 1914, the average annual inflation rate hovers around 3.2%. This means that any loan I leave outstanding and pay the minimum on ""beats"" inflation over time (in theory).

Fed up of downloading all of your wallets separately or having an endless bookmark list of all your online wallets which mysteriously disappear along with all your coins? VaultCoind hopes to change all this and have one centralised place for all of your crypto-currencies.

I started work on VaultCoind a while back with the intent to make a multi-coin wallet for myself to store my dogecoins, bitcoins, litecoins and all the others because I was fed up of downloading buggy qt wallets and filling up my computer storage with blockchains. I've come quite a way into development and I think it's safe to say that I'm not too far off finishing.

I've come to speak with you guys because I'm interesting in expanding the site to support all of you that are interested. I'm looking for a few things, firstly would be people that could work on support and a few more developers to support me in pulling the final site together and keeping it in order. I'm also currently running the whole site completely off my own funds which will surely run out some time in the near future.

I would also like to implement mining pools as well at some point after release to save having to scout around for ages and remember pins etc.

I would be interested in perhaps getting a few sponsors onto the team to help support the rise a growth of this site which I think could have great potential. Sponsors names will be listed and will receive special benefits once the site is up and running and I'd like to get into contact with them to get their views.

If you're interested hit me up, I'm willing to talk to everyone and will try to stay as active as possible on this thread.

personalfinance,Seeking student loan advice,"Hello,

I have some student loans that I'm hoping to pay off, but I'm not sure what order I should start. I know the highest interest go first, but subsidized/unsubsidized? Does it matter, since I'm graduated I'm accruing interest on both of them correct?

Here is my loan layout currently:

Loan 1: $1628 at 6.0% Subsidized

Loan 2: $5468 at 3.4% Subsidized

Loan 3: $5387 at 4.5% Subsidized

Loan 4: $11942 at 6.8% Unsubsidized

Loan 5: $2616 at 6.8% Subsidized

I'm slightly confused on them however, because loans 2,3, and 4 are all rolled into one, so I can't pay each one indivually, otherwise I'd pay off Loan 4 first. So it seems my options are Loan 1, Loan 2/3/4, and Loan 5.

Should I pay off Loan 5 first since I've graduated and it's now accruing interest (albeit a small amount so far) or should I try to pay off the clumped 2/3/4. Or is there some way I can break these 3 up and target 4 specifically?


Edit: I paid off Loans 5 and 1 first. Now all I have left is the clumped 2/3/4. When I called my loan company, they said they automatically apply payments to the highest interest rate loans. So now most of my money is going toward Loan 4.",finance,1393093132

dogecoin,In praise of curmudgeonly shibes,"When I was a teenager, I wanted to be a punk rock star. I could sing - oh god, I could sing. I played electric bass in my high school's jazz band. Now, this was some time ago, for you young shibes. I listened to The Clash, The Sex Pistols, the Dead Kennedys. 

I shaved my head stone cold, left a strip of long mousy brown from forehead to nape, molded it into a row of egg-white solid spikes. My mom screamed. My dad pointed marched me to Father John's confessional, to sit face-to-post-Vatican-II-face in a stuffed leatherette chair.

""1923and1939, you didn't sin by shaving your head.""

Father stifled a giggle. He wore bend 'n stretch jeans, a button-down shirt from Penney's, a pair of tasseled loafers. He smelled like Old Spice and hot dogs. My head itched. I sneered.

""Tell that to my dad.""

I tried to act cool, smooth, a mohawk chick with three safety pins in each ear. I was nothing like the girls who listened to John Cougar Mellencamp, the girls who wore starched sideways ponytails and bright red lipstick, the girls who spread their legs for a ride in any hot Camaro. I wasn't like them. I told myself this, blasted The Clash while my mom watched Days of Our Lives, practiced smoking hand-rolled cigarettes in the second-floor bathroom mirror, my hips wound with two studded belts.

Father couldn't help it. He started giggling, a liberal preacher with sixty years of small parish life behind him, a life of sitting sin shiva with those Camaro girls, with sullen punks like me. His laugh pierced my ear a forth time. I tried to keep my sneer. I tried, I swear. But damn Father Ayers tripped me, the way he always did. I cracked, my parental pain giving way to a burst of laughter as sharp as my hairdo.

""I think it looks great."" Father stood. His pants hung under a belly blessed by tater tot casserole, by seven layer church lady dip. He padded across the confessional to a Lazy-boy chair and grabbed the book sleeping on the green surface. ""Jesus was an outsider, too. Did you realize that? Every time you buck authority, you're closer to Our Lord than ever. Now get out there and push over the money changers' tables, okay? And take this book with you.""

*Shoeless Joe* by W.P. Kinsella. A ghostly baseball player in profile held two bats on the cover. I waved goodbye, hustled home, stuck the book on my nightstand and retired to the bathroom to smoke another 'rette.

I didn't crack the book that night. I didn't crack it for a couple of years, not until one lonely Christmas Eve. I was pregnant, unmarried, my mohawk and safety pins melted into wistful memory. I pressed the play button on a yard sale cassette player, invited Elvis Costello to serenade my kicking child. I pulled the lid from the box I called my time capsule. Elvis began ""Everyday I Write the Book."" I pushed aside my favorite Blondie t-shirt, a three-inch diameter ball made entirely of rubber bands, my Rubics cube, a naked Barbie doll with a homegrown Mohawk. 

I held the spine to my nose. The book smelled a bit like Old Spice, a bit like hot dogs, a bit like Father himself. I opened the cover, thumbed to the first chapter, Shoeless Joe Jackson Comes to Iowa. I didn't close the book until I finished the last page, my eyes bloodshot and heavy with tears, my heart about to burst with home run love, with a new sense of hope. I gave the book to my mailman two days later when he handed me a blank envelope filled with ten dollars and told me someone must have left it in my mailbox. I knew he lied, but I pretended along with him, let him treat my unborn child to a grocery bag filled with real food.

I won't tell you what happened in the book. Maybe you've seen *Field of Dreams*, the movie taken from its pages. Maybe you've read the book itself. If so, you know the magic of a hard wood bat, the magic of seeing things that aren't the same kind of real as the bills that fill my mailbox these days. The book made me trust my inner voice, all those Heys and You Can Do Its no one else would call. 

*Shoeless Joe* came into my life once more, a few months ago after I decided I was a bigger failure than a woman is allowed to be. I was facing a few years of study and apprenticeship to take on a new career whose shoes don't quite fit. He literally fell on my head at the Salvation Army Thrift Store as I perused the book stacks for something interesting to read. 

I picked up the offending tome and realized it was the same edition as the book Father John handed me. Shoeless Joe stood in profile, a diamond imposed on his thoughtful face. I wondered if I would ever hear his voice, hear any voice other than my own sorry ramblings. I opened the cover. Author Bill Kinsella's signature surprised me, a splash of ink across the title page, with a message I know was somehow meant to read, to hear:

**Go the distance**

And that message, which I so desperately needed to hear, is the same message the Dogecoin community desperately needs to hear. There are 65,900 happy, kind, generous shibes here at Reddit, and 100 who were like me: cranky, not willing to bend to authority. These 100 shibes can see the cracks in the community. They can see the cracks in the technology. They want to help, to fix things, to push it all forward in a beautiful punk rock mess, but they look and sound a little different. They are Going the Distance by showing us what needs work, by questioning every movement we take. When we listen, we can hear their heartbeat and know that it is good and valid and important.

Listen to the message before you condemn the messenger. A priest taught me this a long, long time ago. We all have value, and intrinsic beauty. We are all wanting to make Doge the best damned coin with a dog we can. 

Thanks, my lovely fellow shibes. Thanks for everything, every single one of you, the kind, the generous, the grumpy, the curmudgeonly, the quiet, the gentle, the impulsive, the funny, the old, the young - all of you.

We are Dogecoin. ALL of us. Never forget that.

personalfinance,"401(k) Allocations, and how much to contribute with outstanding student loan debt.","26-years-old, graduated college in May 2012 - currently making about $38k/year.  In the last month or so, I became eligible to contribute to a 401(k) at ING through my employer, who matches up to 3%, as well as the option of contributing to a Roth account.  

Additionally, I finished paying off all of my private student loan debt, and now have apprx. $43k in government student loans to chip away at.  These loans range in interest rate from two which are no-interest state loans (about $7500 outstanding), which are obviously bottom priority.  The remainder are between 3.15% and 6.55%, and around $28k is at or closer to 6.55%.

Currently living with my parents, who generously do not make me pay rent.  They understand that I am aggressively paying off student loans (especially to eliminate the close to $20k in private loans at &gt;9% interest rate), and as they did not provide any financial assistance in my education, they're fine with the current situation - for now.  Nonetheless, I contribute at least $200/mo. towards household bills, usually picking up water, electric, and my share of the cable/internet.

investing,Finding a good European fund (to invest savings in euros)...? (x-post from /r/personalfinance),"I hope this is not too generic a question: I have scoured the archives and it seems the bulk of posts in this area are only applicable to US funds/US residents/US dollars...

I am looking to invest some of my savings in a fund with slightly better returns than what your average savings account gets you nowadays (of course, that's after setting aside an emergency fund in a safe, low-return, easily-accessed account).

My savings are in USD, yen and euros, with my preference going strongly toward investing the latter, in the latter's economic zone:

- Japanese local interest rates hovers under 0, investment returns are heavily taxed and I have zero confidence in the longterm financial future of the country.

- US laws unfortunately make it quite difficult to invest anything in the US without holding residence.

- I have dual citizenship between euro countries, while residing abroad, and should be able to freely invest in some of the less tax-heavy countries dealing in euros (Luxembourg...). I also happen to think euro (and most euro funds) are slightly undervalued, especially compared to Asian ones.

And therefore my question is... **how could I go about placing my euro savings in an investment:**

- with a €10,000-€20,000 initial deposit. Adding more as I go.

- view to the long-term (10+ years) but potentially available after a couple years (down-deposit for a house?).

- average risk/return, i.e: better yearly return than a savings account, but low-to-nonexistent chances of losing capital, short of another worldwide 2008-style crash (willing to bet against that for the next 5-10 years).

And, quite importantly:

- that can be opened and managed **remotely** (online) from anywhere in the world. As I do not live in Europe at the moment and do not plan to travel to Luxembourg or elsewhere, every time I want to make a deposit.

personalfinance,23 y.old starting new job on Monday with student loans and credit card debt requesting advice,"I got a full-time job last week (actually a contract-to-hire) in technical field. For 6 months or so, I am hired as a contractor. After (if they like me), I will be hired full-time officially on a higher salary. With that, I finally gladly get to ask for financial advice on here.

* Private student loans is $3k (7.6%). In repayment min $50/month.
* Credit card is $2.8k (0% APR for 13 months). Min payment $50/month.

I live in my parents' house and do not have rent. Most of my food expenses are covered through living at home. 

Since I am a contractor, I do not have 401k contributions. I have health insurance coverage through my mother. My parents gifted me a car so I'm good there and they're paying insurance. I have a girlfriend who doesn't mind being frugal and we could be better in that regards.

personalfinance,Chance to recover from massive debt mistakes - need advice on refinancing unsecured debt.,"My wife and I foolishly took on a large amount of unsecured debt during college. Shortly after we both graduated we ignorantly purchased a house at the top of the market. Then our mortgage was purchased by CitiMortgage who proceeded to massively fraud us by only applying 90% of our payments each month for over a year.

The end result of this was all of our unsecured debt went up to 29.9% after they trashed our formerly decent credit record. After I was laid off last summer - amazingly - I was able to refinance much of my unsecured debt to a somewhat more manageable 8%-13%. My wife - however - still being gainfully employed - could not get any of her creditors - and particularly Citibank - to lower her interest rate at all.

I am finally employed again - and our combined income is now a generous $137,000 before bonuses - (154K potentially after) - however we have had zero luck getting her unsecured debt refinanced due to our still trashed credit record. 

She has over $25,000 on credit cards at 29.9% interest and it is killing us. Any advice on which companies are our best chance to refinance this debt to below 10%? I was thinking that getting a year at 0% introductory rate would work well - as we could pay off her debt more rapidly - unfortunately all attempts to secure balance transfer offers from Citibank's competitors have so far failed.

Any advice would be so gratefully appreciated! We are very thrifty and would rather be giving any extra money to our family and charity instead of some heartless and underhanded corporation.",finance,1393121268
personalfinance,Need help understanding my 401K contributions.,"My employer recently began a 401k which i am eligible to participate in. The plan has an automatic deferral provision which reduces the participants compensation by 6% unless you change the amount or you opt out. My employer is also matching all contributions equal to 100% of elective contributions but not exceeding 1.00% of your compensation for each payroll, plus 50% of elective contributions in excess of .01% but not in excess 0.00% of compensation for each payroll. The matching funds are 100% vested to the participant. This is a traditional 401k and subject to safe harbor provisions.

 I serve tables and take my tips, as cash, home with me at the end of each shift. Each shift's tips are reported to our accounting office and count as income paid to us. The hours worked are paid to us at the rate of $2.13 as long as our hourly rate plus tips is at least federal minimum wage ($7.25) over those same hours. This income earned is given as a paycheck every two weeks. After taxes are taken out of my hourly pay i am left with a $0.00 paycheck. This has been the case for every paycheck over a year and a half. I have been paying off credit card debt with all my extra funds and have paid no mind to saving for retirement. When i was offered the 401k it seemed like a great way to save my hourly earnings (2.13) that i never see anyways by moving them to a retirement account before taxes. I enrolled and elected to make a $70 per pay period contribution. This is my first paystub (which included a $0.00 paycheck) where 401k contributions have been taken out. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/tkMbl2B.jpg)


It has been my understanding that my contribution to my 401k would come out of my earnings (specifically my hourly wage) thereby reducing my gross pay and my overall taxable income. It appears to me that rather than removing my contribution of $70 from the money my hourly wage earned of (86.54+26.61) $113.15  my contribution was paid to me  as ""amount owed to...for 4"" for $70. Thus my hourly, reported tips, and ""amount owed"" equaled my current gross earnings of 1060.91
86.54 + 26.61 + 877.76 + 70 = 1060.91
Then, my contribution is deducted from my gross of 1060.91 after which taxes are taken out.

Is the above method of deductions correct? Should not my gross be 920.91, minus 70 for the ""owed to"" payment and minus 70 for the actual deduction of my contribution?
 Am i being taxed on my contribution in this manner since it is being added to my gross in the form of an additional payment? Am i responsible to pay my elected contribution of $70 out of my cash tips or am i right to believe they are to be taken out of my hourly wages? it has been mentioned that they will require us to pay out of pocket our contribution, is that allowed?

If this setup is wrong, and was done in error/intentional, any suggestions on what i do? 

Anything else i need to know?

My marginal tax rate is 15%. 

Does the rate of tax look appropriate to earnings? (figured it might be strange to always make 0.00 as a server but maybe not.)

Bitcoin,Message from 2078,"The years in the lead up to 2045, the Large Hadron Collider @  CERN (LHC) had discovered and observed that the Higgs Singlet does indeed exist. It was only until now in 2078 that we have been successful in being able to harness it's properties to transport this message through the internet to you.


We live in a world very different. The USA and it's allies have been wiped off the map through intensive nuclear warfare that lasted almost a decade. Most of our planet is uninhabitable and irradiated. Through some miracle our facility survived the war, and is still operating today as the last hope to reverse the tragedies that had occurred. 


Bitcoin was the brainchild of the ""global elite"" as they saw themselves at the time, and was envisioned to be a tool of stealth economic warfare, it was a way for the west to default on all of it's debt without any perceived penalties, as it theoretically couldn't be traced back to any one person or nation. The ultimate goal for Bitcoin was for it to become the only currency on Earth, in doing this, the idea was that the entire wealth of the planet would be transferred into the hands of the ""global elite"". With that kind of control meant they would truly rule the Earth without having to result to conventional warfare. The people tasked with seeing this idea come to light was none other than a group of NSA scientists who had made advancements in the areas of cryptography, and for this platform to be launched across the internet. They thought it was fool proof.


The lead NSA scientist of this project was none other than Tatsuaki Okamoto, you can see his papers at:

http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/o/Okamoto:Tatsuaki.html



Bitcoin provided many advantages for the impoverished at the time and especially in countries such as China that has strict Capital controls and a forever debasing national currency. It was envisioned as unstoppable since it took a grass roots approach of adoption, and managed to get the people in its target countries on its side.



The price of a Bitcoin was dictated through a process that was hidden very well by the only major mining manufacturing company who controlled the significant majority of the networks hardware production. This company was KnCMiner, who were infact just seed funded and operated through the NSA. They were strictly operated under instruction of the NSA, to benefit the agenda of the globalist creators who envisioned Bitcoin. The way Bitcoin really took off at its roots was by the best motivator of all: greed. The visions of fortunes by the ""investors"" and everyone who bought into it, kept coming true year after year, as the price would ""bubble"" in many orders of magnitudes higher than its previous price. The price never came down. This catapulted it into mainstream attention and investment, as it also had real tangible advantages to other tech at the time such as credit cards. Anyone with access to the internet in every single country, especially those in poor ones would pour everything they had to get a piece of the pie.


Eventually every single sovereign country, had squandered their wealth as they bought into the Bitcoin pie. This meant that they were now ""owned"" by the globalists. The same globalists who seeded KnCminer, and the same globalists who mined as ""Satoshi"" from the start are sitting on 95% of the total Bitcoins in circulation that they never sold from the start as the rest of the world fought to control the remaining 5%. The amount of Bitcoins that mining company Avalon managed to acquire pales in comparison to what the globalists were sitting on, and they were content with that.


To put this into perspective, wealth distribution that was forecasted by the globalists if their plan for Bitcoin had succeeded was higher than 95% for them, and 5% for the rest of the planet.


Before Bitcoin was created the wealth distribution was orders of magnitudes lower than if their plan had succeeded, and they didn't control and own every country on the planet before this. If their plan was to succeed, we will never know what their agenda could've been for the planet. Some say today that they were planning to depopulate the Earth. Although they had achieved that indirectly, it was an outstanding failure as it has been at a great cost to the environment, something they were trying to save. Perhaps they were doing it as a way to move the planet into a more sustainable and controlled order, perhaps their vision was after all for the benefit of all mankind and they thought they knew better than everyone else and they knew that most of the world wouldn't see eye to eye with them, or what had to be done for our long term survival as a species. Nothing they were planning could've been seen as ""sane"". But the old ideologies and how the world was at the time, it was impossible without having complete control to execute their plans.


I will go into a little more information on how KnC Miner managed to prop the price of Bitcoins up on the exchanges to achieve their goal of world domination through adoption via greed. They manufactured huge data centers of ASICS, and mined a large amount of coins and then put them into cold storage. With each advancement in chips, and hardware design, they would create a new data center to mine with this hardware, these centers never went offline. They would then manufacture and ship out the same amount of hash power relative to their data centers hash power of consumer hardware at a set price, AT a time where the consumer miners would not see a ROI on the machine. KnC knew how to time this as they basically controlled the production on the network. Most of the buyers had no way to see this when they purchased the machine as the network hashrate never seemed to go up substantially until they shipped their orders out. Since a huge percentage of all minted coins are never sold and held by the globalists, a relatively small amount of money is able to move the ""free market"" price of a Bitcoin on the exchanges. For a 50 billion market cap Bitcoin, it required only a 100 million of new money to sustain the price. The mining hardware manufacturer KnC, and early day miners (Satoshi/NSA), who were effectively owned and instructed by the globalists sat on a ""kill switch"" for Bitcoin.


Through this price manipulation, greed as a motivator was able to catapult Bitcoin into worldwide adoption, along with all national currencies entering the stage known as hyperinflation. The ""kill switch"" that the globalists sat on would never be executed, as then they would also be executing themselves and their plan for control.


The USA and its allies began to fiercely debase their currency through hyperinflation as it was struggling to pay its national debt, the main holders of US Bonds was China, essentially now they were becoming worthless.



At some point, and fed up... mainly China and Russia formed an alliance and saw Bitcoin as the final straw of economic attack on their sovereignty, and they could not stop it as most of their populace were using it. It was stealth economic warfare initiated by the globalists who were running the show over in the USA and the western world (note: they controlled the USA just like every other country they owned, anything they did was not to benefit the USA and was for their own globalist agendas). China and Russia's investigative secret services were able to pin its creation to the NSA, and a new nuclear world war had started. China and Russia vs the USA and it's allies (Who was just a front country, the globalists had infiltrated and controlled them from almost a century before).



Currently Caucasians are a &lt;5% minority on the planet, most of them reside in the larger Russian area and small parts in Europe that weren't effected by the nukes. North America as a continent is mostly irradiated and uninhabitable, along with most of Europe.


Hopefully the globalists see this message and realise that their plan has failed them, please execute the kill switch and leave your plans to perhaps another day for when you have the technology to stop and shoot down a worldwide continental nuclear attack. The fate of the planet that you were trying to save has been left an environmental wasteland. Please stop.

This is what I think will really happen:
-Companies and hobbyists will race to develop ultra cheap and accessible mining hardware. Not everyone will be a miner but it will be open anyone willing to treat it like a serious business and not just a side hobby. While bitcoin is 1s &amp; 0s, mining hardware is physical and requires very precise and durable machinery to keep it running 24 hours a days along with compotent technicians to maintain it.

-Hardware companies will also race to develop ultra cheap meshnet transmitters that will not really be that different from your $35 wlan. 

-Programmers and hardware developers will work together to develop new programming languages and physical hardware that ensure encryption on all ends and simplifies everything to speed up transactions and data transfers.

-People will develop cold storage wallets that cost pennies or are free and are somewhat idiot proofed

-There will be companies specializing in higly secure and idiot proofed cold storage wallets for any type of customer.

-The might be a hard fork in the blockchain to switch to more streamlined programming language such machine language

-Governments will not be able to regulate anyone since it will all be based on mathematical formulas which are irrellevant to any nation, organization or individual. It also helps that most nation states today are already bankrupt and falling apart.

-Namecoin will become more popular and there anyone will have the ability to mark property ownership and sign enforcable contract for pennies or for free. This is will enable univeral common law to replace dictatorial statute law as people will be able to mathematically prove whether or not there was a crime in many cases

-Public goods and services will be provided by innovative entrepreneurs who figure how to mix good solid business practices with charity and public interest. This could be something like providing extremely lucrative contracts to pave and maintain while also leaving it open to public or even marking it as public good on the namecoin system

-Cryptographic democracy will be used in certain organizations and businesses for their own internal proceedings but the general population will live in their own unique systems and a live and let live mindset allowing for a massive variety in culture while also preventing conflict at the same time.",cryptocurrency,1393163843

personalfinance,"Long-winded request for thoughts and advice [24, employed, treadmilling a bit]","Apologies for the throwaway, simply too much personal info to attach to my real account!

* I am 24, employed at a start up ($65k). 
* I rent, my third being $800 + Utilities (between $70-$120 [winter gas]). 
* I also pay about $850 a month in student loans. 

My total student loan debt is $73k at the moment. That's a mix of about $25k from Federal Subsidized/Unsubsidized, $7k in Federal Parents PLUS (I pay the loan my mother cosigned for me, even though it is her debt - it's my education. Fuck the 2008-2009 financial crisis), and the remainder in a public/private loan offered by my state. 

Theoretically, I should be able to pay my loans double each month quite easily. I don't pay for a cellphone, nor cable. I have a few minor subscriptions like a music service, Netflix, Zipcar (expense it to the company entirely). 

How about my current financial status? I purchase a lot of my personal credit card for work. I expense almost everything (if I buy beer while on business, I won't expense) that is work related, perhaps missing a parking garage bill here or there. I have been doing this treadmill for a little over a year now where I purchase a fair amount of flights etc for work, submit them, and then have to wait 30+ days to receive the repayment. Other times I get the payment back in two weeks. To be honest, I'm not here to debate this portion - I have gotten very good at preventing having to buy these items myself, and pushed the obligation onto the company or our client whenever possible. But the result of this (especially before the last three months of improvement) has been that I have to utilize my paychecks to pay my $1600 rent/utilities followed by whatever my previous month's balance on the credit card was. So I have run $4-5000 in credit many months, but always managed to scrape together enough between my expense reimbursements and my two monthly paychecks to avoid ever paying CC interest. The company is fully aware that I will expense any interest that I receive, which generally gets me a check in the nick of time when I see it could happen. So to answer the question at the start of the paragraph, how about my current status?

* $2000 in CC debt, $1800 of which I will receive in reimbursements in the next 1-4 weeks. I have already paid the February starting balance, so I technically owe nothing here 'til end of March's billing cycle. 
* $0 balance - A second credit card that I do not use any longer, which helped my credit utilization ratio, and got me a TV with rewards points - all paid for with work reimbursements, only ever put $6000 on the card throughout its life. 
* $500 in a basic savings account (you get 3.04% on the first $500, more paltry 0.05% on anything after that)
* $1300 in a Money market savings account (0.80% after $1000, no change 'til $10,000)
* $60 in a E-Trade Securities account (I decided a few weeks ago to occasionally put 1% of a paycheck in there so that once I end up with $500, I can maybe invest Foolishly [try to not grumble at me too much here, it'd be for fun!])
*5000 options in my start up, all of which are currently vesting a bit more each month, but won't complete for another 2.5-3 years. These are most likely entirely worthless unless something really good happens for the company. 

I've done all my personal purchasing on my credit card since I got it almost two years ago, right when I first joined the workforce. But as I mentioned, I have yet to carry a balance yet. I have resolved to start using my debit card for any personal purchases such as groceries again. It'll be tough for a little bit as I work out how to balance over paying my work credit card in advance (paying just the previous month's balance and then waiting for expense reimbursements to pay the rest). The key here is I personally want to prevent ever carrying a balance on a personal card that the company enjoys the benefit of 30 days to pay me back on. They know I will expense them interest, and they have acknowledged it will be paid if it ever occurs. So it's kind of a detente situation. But like I said, I haven't carried a balance or accrued a cent of interest in almost two years with the card.

My credit utilization ratio is pretty high, which is why I had a second credit card for awhile in use. Now it is not in use, but I do not want to cancel it as I still manage to regularly use $2000 in work expenses a month. To give you perspective, my card limit is $5000 and the spare card is $2400. My credit rating is about 704, it used to be 720. Reports suggest it's the CUR more than anything else (plus the massive student loans, I am sure!) I will hold off on closing this spare card 'til I end up with a new job that requires me spend less for work flights etc. For now, I've read that it helps to keep this second, dormant, card to help lower my CUR. It has no fees etc, so. 

So! Finally down to my question. What should my emergency fund be (in your opinion) before paying all excess income into student loan repayment? 1 month's bills? 3 month's? 6 month's? Should I even consider doing any retirement planning before paying down the $72k in student loans? My company does not offer a 401K. Do you have any other general thoughts?",finance,1393186802

Car: Own a 1996 Volvo that is about to die. Cant pass a smog test that it needs to pass for me to reregister for this year.  

Motorcycle: Made a stupid impulsive buy with some money I earned at an internship a few months ago. (Paid off)  

No emergency funds. Dumping excess money in bank account to loans.  

Spent the last couple of months paying off 3k of CC debt  

How this happened:   
My parents’ income were deemed pretty high when I was in highschool and so when I applied for financial aid for college I didnt get any. Even though my parents could have technically helped pay for my education, they couldnt because theyre pretty bad with their money as well (different story). My parents had me be responsible for signing up for my own private loans and really at the time, I had no idea what I was doing and so I just signed up with the first bank that was willing to give me money for school.

My parents filled for bankruptcy during my 3rd year and since they cosigned my loans, the loans automatically went into repayment. I had no job at the time and so I couldnt pay and had 2 of my loans at ~20k each go into “charged off” state. I asked an uncle of mine to cosign for me for my future loans so I could finish my degree.

Recently graduated this past June and had a 3 month internship. At the end of the internship, my company liked me and brought me in full time at 70k.


Plan:
Currently paying $1400 a month on student loans (more whenever theres any surplus in my bank account). Doing the minimum payments on all of the loans except for the big one at 10% which Im dumping as much as I can into.

Vehicle:
My car is probably going to cost me more to repair than it is worth so I am thinking of getting a (new to me) used car. I know that the general mentality that I found here is to buy a $5000 car but Im thinking that going with that route might result in the same thing that is happening now. Me having to pay for repairs in a couple of years. So Im thinking of getting a used car that is closer to $12k worth and use the hell out of that in the next 15 years. Can I get some feedback on this, please?

Posted my motorcycle on craigslist to sell and use that money either as down payment for a car or use to drop the principal on that 10% student loan.

Budget:
I have one (I use mint). I set my budget to $640 for groceries, restaurants, gas, fast food, and coffee. Ive been under that budget the last couple of months though so I think I can pull off a $500 budget per month.

Expected increase in rent in June. I am currently living with 4 other guys in a 2 bedroom 1 ba apartment. Been living like this for a year now to save cost in rent (~300/mo) at the moment. I know its really cheap but I can’t stand it anymore (theres barely any room to breathe, especially when they all bring their SO over, there’s like 8 people in one tiny apt). When our lease ends in June, I plan on moving out and getting my own room in a house thats renting out a room that will increase my rent to ~$700-750/month.

Investments:
I opened a roth-IRA account because the idea of investing for my retirement now, really appealed to me. But after I thought about it, maybe paying off my loans would be a higher priority before maxing out my roth.
Investing 3% of salary to 401k, my company does NOT match. Should I use this money into paying off my loans instead of shoving that 3% there?


I would really appreciate some advice on the my vehicle situation, investments vs loans, and lastly if anyone has any advice on that charged off loan. When I talked to the bank about it, they said that it is not accumulating any interest because of its status. When I heard this, I thought “Great! I can pay a little on that one and focus on the big 10% interest rate loan” but then I started really thinking and thought that its probably really bad for my credit that that is there, right? I really wish to purchase my own home in my mid thirties if possible and so I would want clean credit the next 10 years right?

worldpolitics,"Police goes violent against protesters on Second Anti-World Cup protests in São Paulo, Brazil","I share with you my girlfriend's experience. She's a Norwegian living for 9 months already in São Paulo.

Yesterday I was at my first demonstration against the world cup in Brazil. With more military police than demonstrators, several helicopters circulating in the air, unprovoked violation and detainment of 260 protesters, it was a shocking experience. The message from the government is quite clear: when it comes to the World Cup, you do not have the right to demonstrate.

The act yesterday is part of a series of demonstration that is planned to take place each month until the world cup in June, with the slogan “No social rights, no World Cup”. The point here is not simply to say, “we do not want this cup”, but to make it clear that without covering basic needs of the population you cannot use public money to arrange such an expensive feast (the estimated price is 33 billion reais, more than the three last world cups all together). The topics are education, transport, health and habitation and for each month one of these themes will be in focus. Yesterday was the march of education. I would imagine that this is not such a radical proposition: one of the few things Brazilians actually agree upon is that lack of a good public educational system is one of the main problems in Brazil. Less money on World Cup, more money on education, seems quite fair to me. However, the reaction of the government to such a proposal does not indicate this. 

I arrived at the starting point of the demonstration, in front of the Ministry of Education at Praca da República, at around five pm. Some protesters had been camping there since the night before, painting posters etc, but it was only then that people really started to gather. Being the week before Carnaval and with a dark sky indicating rain, there were few people compared to last month’s demonstration. The military police, the PMs, estimated around 1000 protesters, and the movement around 2-3000. As I got there, the streets close by and the square were already filled with PMs. It is funny how their presence has the tendency to make you feel that you are doing something wrong, or at least illegal, and your hearts starts immediately to bump. 

The impressions of demonstrators with their banners, slogans, paint and drumbeats are also strong. Protesters as well as photographers and journalists are covering up in helmets (rubber bullets), gas masks (tear gas) or hiding their faces with masks or t-shits (photos and registrations. Several militants have already received letters from the police at their homes, to meet up at the police station for interrogation about their involvement in the movement). What has the strongest impact is the look of the Black Blocs. This controversial and almost mythical concept is a tactic, where groups of people, mostly young black boys from the periphery, dress up in black, cover their faces, and practically improvised organize themselves during the protests. As well as participating in the demonstrations, they are known for destroying “symbols of capitalism”, such as windows of banks and McDonalds, and react strategically (and sometime also violent) to the repression of the police. Whether they are anti-capitalists, anarchic or without some specific political identity, what they have in common is an anger and frustration toward the PMs and capitalism. Even having read and heard all from condemnation to praising for months, it is something different to see them in real life, these young boys chained together arm in arm, with this hard determination in their eyes. 17 year olds, 15 year olds, and one boy who can’t be more than 13. “How come they aren’t scared?” I ask my friend, thinking of the heavily armed police around us. “They are used to this”. She explained me. “This is their everyday life”. In Sao Paulo, the police kills more people (most of them black, poor, young boys) per year than all of the police in the US together. Humanitarian organization such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch call it the genocide of black youth. These are the ones who don’t have much else to lose. 

The march starts to walk at around 6 pm. The energy is pulsing, and shouting slogans along with drum beats feels liberation for the nervousness: “The cup I´ll live without, what we want is health and education”, “Demilitarize the police”, “Fifa, pay my bus ticket”. We go through the avenues of Sao Paulo. An hour into the demonstration, 50 meters ahead of my friends and me, the first bomb is released from the police. What just happened? People start to scream and run. It is my immediate impulse as well, before my friend puts her hand calmly on my arm yelling along with others to the crowd: “Calm down, calm down!” It is dangerous to run out like that in panic, and exactly what the police want. We reverse a bit slowly, go to the side, trying to see what is going on. I can see a lot of movement, hear screaming and in the “horizon”, PMs as far as I can see, blocking the road. The crowd around us starts to clap their hands and yell loudly: “PMs, stop the repression, it is my right to be in the demonstration”. We jump in the choir as well. My companion calls me, he is one of the organizers of the march. We have been through this: as for it being my first demonstration in Brazil, I am a foreigner in process for a permanent visa, along with the fact that I am of the nervous kind it is not worth it to hang around when things get tough. After saying goodbye to my friends, with my hearts in my ears and trembling, I sneak into a sideway and head back to the start point of the demonstration. Several helicopters are circulating in the sky, giving the right touch of drama. People there can tell me that several have been arrested, beaten, and that a guy’s knee got severely broken. When other demonstrator’s retreats, along with the police and bombs of teargas, I find it best to go to my home nearby. 

After an hour in my home at the computer reading the coverings, streaming online and waiting for my companion, he returns to home. Unnecessary to say I am relieved. He is OK, a part from an infiltrated police (yes, they were present at the march, as an extra force, specialists in martial arts. Official reason: reduce the violence) illegally photographed his ID. Just before he gives an interview to a journalist as a protester. As my companion puts it: when you get scared that the police have your ID after having participated peacefully in a demonstration, it says something about the government in question. After checking the news, different contacts and taking a time-out we return to Praça da República. The demonstration is over, the police is debriefed and suspended for the day, and the protesters are sharing their experiences, photos, movies and bruises (!) from the evening. 

Officially numbers shows that 260 protesters are detained, six of them journalists. Even experienced protesters are shocked by the violence. After reading different coverage’s, seeing photos and hearing peoples story, the puzzle gets it’s form. What happened earlier with the first bomb and confusion not far from us was apparently an attempt to seize the Black Blocs. They had managed to get in the front of the march. With help from the filtrated police, the PMs released the bomb to disperse the group and then encircled around 150 protesters with e.g. martial art techniques. Several of these were beaten with truncheons. They were transported in busses to the stations. Apart from the fact that several of these protesters were dark clothes, or hid their faces, this was done with no basis whatsoever. Simply from the fact of being present at the demonstration. No violence, nor “vandalism” had yet occurred, and still the protesters were treated as criminals. This is criminalization of the demonstrations. Later on, and we saw videos of this, protesters were encircled again, held for around ten minutes. The PMs then opened up the circle letting the protesters go. While they walked away with their backs to the police, on of the officers lifts a blue flag and the PM runs screaming towards the protesters, beating them with truncheons, putting them to the ground, and getting them detained. Apart from this, dozens of stories, testimonies of unprovoked violence, people with cameras denied or aggravated. Photos of this, and soon, videos will be spread through Internet.

If you still are in doubt that the reactions from the government and military police is harsh, and think that the main part of demonstrators were violent and deserved to be detained or violated, the answer is quite simple: join us for the next demonstration and see for yourself.

personalfinance,(UK) Funny story about how I lowered the APR on my credit card by 16%,"I have a credit card with one of the biggest CC providers in the UK. I got it a few years ago and I got ~£100 cashback on a website for taking it out. The APR was 34.9% so it was quite high but I didn't really use it much. I was given a £750 limit and I used the card mainly for the protection of large purchases. Long story short, I made a £350 purchase about 2 weeks ago which is still on the card and didn't pay it off immediately as I usually do.
I phoned up the credit card company and asked them if there was any way to reduce the interest rate on my credit card. I was given the usual scripted nonsense about interest rates being tied to risk and credit scoring etc and that these can't be changed. I reminded him that I had never made a late payment or missed a payment so I can't see myself as that much of a risk. He still refused to reduce the APR on my credit card. I then told him that I had just been granted a new credit card from another provider but the APR was only 18.9% so I wanted to transfer the balance on to the card with the lower interest rate. The sales adviser at the other end of the phone was very persuasive in offering me a 'Payment Holiday' and offered to freeze the interest etc in order for me to leave the balance with them. I then made the sales adviser a proposal. I would keep the balance on their card if they lowered my APR to match that of my new credit card. He offered to lower it to 24.9% from 34.9% immediately. I was impressed, but I calmly told him that would mean I'm still paying 6% additional APR with no benefit to myself. He then placed me on hold and asked to speak to his supervisor. A couple of minutes later, he said that his supervisor has agreed to allow him to lower the APR of my card from 34.9% to 18.9% - the same as my new credit card. This was applied with immediate effect and I received a confirmation email to my PC while I was still on the phone. I was very pleased with this and I agreed to keep the balance on the card at the reduced APR rate.
As soon as I got off the phone, I went onto my online account and paid off the £350 balance immediately. 
This means I now have a credit card with an interest rate almost half that it was before, all for the sake of a 15-minute phone call. 

But here's the punchline....

I never had a ""New Credit Card"" at 18.9% APR to start with ;-)",finance,1393197191

personalfinance,25/F making reasonable headway on student loans but looking for advice,"Hey /r/PF, 

I'm a 25 year old female who recently moved back to the US and am looking for some advice.



About my income and monthly expenses:

* I make about 4,000 (some times as much as 9K but never lower than 4,000) a month after taxes and contributions to a 401K and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

* I pay 1,200 a month in rent and utilities and cannot lower this - all of my monthly expenses are bundled into my rent and I currently have the ""lowest"" tier of everything - just internet and electricity and water and garbage.

* I pay about 600 in groceries every 4-6 weeks depending on my consumption

* I have a $100 phone bill due to international usage as I travel for work (this is after my employer reimburses me for various charges and things that I can be comp'd for)

* I pay between 1000-1200 a month in student loans itemized later in this post.

* Every two months I travel to see my boyfriend as he works abroad in the country I left. I spend between 800-1200 in plane tickets. This is non-negotiable, as he covers all other expenses when I come to see him. I find this fair, as we often meet in other countries to which he pays for EVERYTHING. 

* Everything else is dumped into a savings account




I have 3 private loans from wells fargo and 4 federal loans itemized below:

* 23,385 from wells fargo at a 4.25% interest rate

* 22,273 from wells fargo at 3.5% interest rate

* 25,525 from wells fargo at 4.5% interest rate

* 4,500 Stafford loan at 5.6% interest rate

* 1,920 Stafford loan at 6.8% interest rate

* 4,550 Direct Sub at 4.5% interest rate

* 1,825 Direct Unsub at 6.8% interest rate



I have a good reliable car that I spend maybe 150 a month in gas.

I have 2 credit cards, one that carries a zero balance, and one that I owe 1,100 on due to an unforeseen medical expense I need, and am paying off around 250 a month on.

I have a very decent credit score for having as much debt as I do - 750 FICO.

I have a 7,000 emergency fund that I can access if I really need to.


What can I do to more rapidly pay off my student loans and save a bit more, barring the trips to see my SO? With my ESPP, should I dump the stock every time it's credited to my account? The last few weeks, my spending has been a bit high, but not exceeding my paycheck + a bit of saving, but this is just due to weddings and the like that I've attended for friends.

Looking for any advice and insight you all have.

personalfinance,"Questions about credit history, current status and applying for a credit card.","Hello PF!  I have some questions about credit cards.

A little background: 

I'm a married 30 year-old with one child living in a high cost-of-living area in the US.  My wife and I both work, and we handle all our finances jointly.  I'm in my final year of graduate school, working as student intern with the promise to become a full employee upon finishing my PhD (my tuition is paid by my employer).  Our combined income is $93,000.  When I graduate this fall it will become $110,000.

We live as cheaply as we can in the area, saving every penny for a 20% down payment on a house.  Seriously, we make breakfast, lunch and dinner at home every day (and even make our own baby food).  We eat out less than twice in a month.  Our total expenses every month are $4000 for rent, transportation, child care, utilities, groceries,  insurance, etc.  

The only debt we have is a combined ~$5000 in student loans that we are actively paying off.  We have and emergency fund ($15,000 in an online savings account), and $27,000 between two different credit union savings accounts.  We both have retirement plans through work, into which we are contributing the employer-matching amount (5%).

I have had issues with my credit reports in the past.  In 2009, I was once 60 days late on paying my student loan (it was a simple, stupid mistake of me forgetting to pay the bill).  Additionally within the past two months, I successfully disputed a tax lien that had been incorrectly reported to my credit history.  That issue was removed without incident from my reports.

We have no credit cards.  We did up until last November.  We had two Bank of America credit cards that never carried a balance and we hadn't used in over four years.  We got fed up with BOA for their shitty customer service, and the nickle-and-dime fees they kept charging over the years.  Our disgust came to a head last fall and we closed all deposit accounts and both cards.  In hindsight, it was a bad idea to close those cards since they were our oldest (~7 years), but at the time we didn't know that it could negatively affect our credit.
 
Questions:

1)  I tend to be old school and do everything with paper statements, and pay our bills with checks in the mail.  I know this is inefficient, and can be dangerous (like when I forgot to make my student loan payment once).  I'd like to set up automatic bill pay, but I'd also like to make the money go further.  Would it be beneficial to open a new credit card to pay bills with (preferably, one that has a good rewards program)?  We would pay it off every month.  My wife has never had any issues with credit, and her reports are all positive.

2) Would applying for said credit card now be a good thing for our credit rating and mortgage application if we want to buy a house in 9-12 months?

3) I don't know much about rewards programs, and ones we should consider to be ""good.""  For example, we spend a lot on gas/groceries, but we also like to travel once a year, so I don't know if a cash back card would be better than a travel rewards points card.  How do I decide which type of card would give me the most bang for the buck?

4) Should we maintain our current ethos of joint finances and get card(s) that we can both use?  Or would it be better for us to get individual ones?",finance,1393202787

This is easily the biggest hit to our monthly budget, and to be honest something we should have never bought into and put on ourselves. I'm not going to make excuses it wont save ourselves the headache or make us feel better about it. We want to smarter about how we handle ourselves financially. 

His car has about 15,000 and mine has about 18,000 from two different companies. I don't know if it is unrealistic, but I want to cut our payments in half and I don't even know the correct way to go about it.

I’m not too concerned with everyone knowing how much I make as it’s readily available to everyone on the Defense Finance website. I’m currently an E-4 on active duty and my take home pay post taxes, to include BAS and BAH, is ~$2700/month. My monthly expenses are as follows:


* Rent: $625
* Car loan: $193
* Car insurance (collision and liability required by my lender): $150
* Utilities (Gas &amp; electric): ~$80
* Verizon bill: $85
* Groceries: $150
* Petrol: $100
* Internet: $30
* Discover credit card: $50
* Amazon credit card: $25


That’s pretty much it for my “must pay” expenses. My credit card/loan balances and rates are as follows:


* Car loan: $7200 / 2.9% APR / 48 month loan, 10 months down, 38 to go
* Discover credit card: $2200 / 0% APR until July 2015 (Just opened this one and transferred my two other high interest rate cards)
* Amazon store card: $250 / 0% APR until June 2014 (used it to buy all of my Christmas shopping this year, all with special financing) 



In addition to this, I’m engaged and am saving up for a wedding. My parents split my senior year of high school and are still fighting each other in court, so any expenses that they traditionally cover will be out of my pocket. I’m not mad at them or anything, but my wedding fund will be turning into my emergency fund after we get married. We aren’t getting married this year, we know that for sure, we just don’t know when.  I currently have $3500 saved towards a wedding, and am saving $500 a month religiously after kind of being financially ignorant for the majority of last year. I am planning to have a 10k wedding fund by this time next year. I know for a fact that’s overshooting our budget for the wedding (which is about $3-5k, super small wedding in the middle of nowhere where we’re both from)



On top of that I’m also saving $100 a month towards an emergency “emergency” fund. I had car problems the beginning of last year that contributed to my relatively high credit card debt. Since then I’ve been putting just a bit back every month just in case. 



Finally, I just took a look at my expenses and finances in January and noticed that I was blowing close to $400 a month on stuff that I couldn’t account for. So, after re-establishing my mint.com profile, I now save $300 of that a month towards travelling. My fiancée doesn’t live close so anytime we want to see each other (which is about five to six times a year) we have to fly. This is one area that I know that I could probably cut down, but until we’re married, I don’t really think I could ask my fiancée to just, you know, not visit lol.



An additional source of income that I currently have going for me is I donate plasma 2x a week and that brings in an additional ~$280/month. I use that towards gas and groceries. 



After all that, here is my actual monthly budget:


* Rent: ($625)
* Car loan: ($193)
* Car insurance (collision and liability required by my lender): ($150)
* Utilities (Gas &amp; electric): (~$80)
* Verizon bill: ($85)
* Groceries: $150
* Petrol: $100
* Internet: ($30)
* Discover credit card: ($200)
* Amazon credit card: ($100)
* Wedding fund/long term EF: $500
* Short term EF: $100
* Travel fund: $300



Total Incoming: ~$3000
Total outgoing: $2613



Any leftover money I usually put in the wedding fund. I don’t really ever go out; if I do it may be once a month to the movies or something. Also since the beginning of the year I’ve tried to become more health-conscience as well and stopped eating fast food and the like all together.  If I’m with my fiancée, we may go out to eat once or twice to a nice restaurant, but since we don’t see each other that often, I don’t really count it as a monthly thing. 



Terribly, TERRIBLY sorry that it’s so long winded, but, if you’ve made it this far, thanks! I’m open to any advice! My parents filed bankruptcy a year before they divorced and I’d like to avoid both of those pitfalls as I start a new life with my fiancée/wife! Am I saving too much?

I have an emergency fund of $4000 saved up, and I'm planning to throw $450/month at a Vanguard Roth IRA in order to max out my contributions. I understand that's important, but I'm wondering if I should throw all of my ""savings"" portion of my stipend into the IRA, or if I should hold onto some of it for short term needs like an engagement ring (currently single, but I can dream), car replacement, or house down payment? I'm aware I can withdraw contributions at any time, but I'm just wondering if it's better to save for short term needs like those in a savings account or I-bonds rather than putting all $450/month into an IRA. Should I just max out my contributions and place some in a money market fund to minimize risk, or reduce my retirement savings and instead keep some more in a savings account for those short-term goals?

After I'm done with school, I'd like to work for the federal government as a civil servant, or ideally a Public Health Service officer, which comes with BAH/BAS and a whole host of military benefits. Either way, they have substantial retirement benefits in the form of military pension/FERS and TSP, and I don't really plan on retiring early even once I'm ""financially independent"" because work in this field is what I'd do even if I had all the money I needed to live comfortably. If anything, I'd retire from the PHS at 50ish and take a job that included more teaching or something where I'd have more autonomy to pursue my own goals.",finance,1393207099
personalfinance,Community College debt sent to third party collections; college itself is now making a play against my state tax refund?,"Evenin', /r/pf...

First.. yep, letting it get this far was dumb.  Been trying to sort my finances out post-divorce -- not saying this as an excuse, but more of a ""I'm not sleepwalking through this, but haven't gotten to fixing everything yet.""

So, the situation as I know it.

I was a student at a community college in the great state of my residence -- Indiana, back in 2008, and it was bought and paid for in its entirety with federal student loans, or so I believed.

Last summer, I got a letter from a third party collections agency, attempting to collect on behalf of the college, informing me that I owed a admittedly paltry sum (under $500).  Sadly, other things were going on in my life, and I spaced contesting it in writing entirely, and have basically ignored it entirely to date.

Like a good citizen, I filed my taxes at the end of January, and am expecting an even more paltry sum from my great state of Indiana -- under $200. (To my credit, I ended up owing the feds a $5 bill.)

Here's where it gets interesting.  I got a letter today from the college, informing me that they noticed I was entitled to a refund, and that my state refund would be ""intercepted from your state tax refund in order to pay towards the balance due"" the college.

Given that the bad debt is listed on my credit report, and was put there in the name of the collections agency, can the college actually do this?  Who do I actually owe the money to?  Can two entities actually try for the same debt? If I pay one, or the other, will it actually get marked as paid on my report?  

I've never seen such a thing -- does anyone have any advice on the best way to come at this?",finance,1393207721

personalfinance,What is the smartest way to use my (smallish) student refund?,"Due to changing my housing situation this semester, I have found myself with a bit of extra money, not a lot, but around $1,500 (a combination of a student loan refund and money made from my job, all of which had been put towards upfront housing cost). I am unsure what to do with it. At present, I am holding it in my checking account, and simply not touching it. I don't have any pressing and present need for it. Since getting it a few months ago, I have tossed around a few ideas. Any advice about the best option (or one I hadn't considered) would be appreciated!

1. Pay off my car. I have about this much left on it. Since I was able to put down a substantial amount up front, I got a decent interest rate. However, my banker advised me to keep the loan out for at least another month or two, as she said it would raise my credit score. Thoughts on that advice?

2. Put it towards paying back existing student loans. Besides the car, this is the only debt I have.

3. Keep it for next year, and reduce potential new student loans. This is the option I am most leaning towards.

4. Add it to the emergency fund.

I'm not sure what is best, but I don't like having money that has not been allocated a purpose. It bothers me.",finance,1393214798
personalfinance,Looking for advice about possibly paying off credit card with retirement fund and need general financial advice/criticism.,"Hello everyone!  
The facts, 

$7,500 in cc debt. Which is down from about $9,000 6 months ago.

$900 in a savings account.

I earn $2,500 a month.

My cost of living averages around $2000 rent, food, gas, student loans, car insurance, bills, ect. (I spend less than $100 a month on personal extravagance)

I have $10,000 in a retirement account where my employer matches my contribution.

Age: 25

I pretty much live off my credit card, as in I buy everything with my credit card and then pay as much as I can towards it each month which is usually at least double the minimum payment.  EDIT.  I pay off my monthly expenses on my credit card plus at LEAST double the minimum payment.

My question circles around how bad of an idea would it be to take the penalties (10% I believe) and withdrawal my retirement account and wipe my cc debt clean? My credit cards interest rate is somewhere around 15%.  Or do I go with the option to continue to pay interest and take to projected year and a half to pay the card off?  I would like to keep my retirement account but hate paying interest on my credit card.

I greatly appreciate any advice, thanks everyone.",finance,1393215669

personalfinance,[US] Confusion on SIMPLE IRA vs Roth IRA,"Hi guys. I recently subscribed to this subreddit and I’ve been learning a lot. I currently need some advise with retirement planning. I’m trying to be smarter about my decisions. I work for a small company that matches 2.5% in a SIMPLE IRA (managed by State Farm), which I obviously match. When I was hired, I was convinced (by the SF agent) into opening a Roth IRA (LifePath [2040](http://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF%3ANLOAX) and [2050](http://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF:NLPAX)). I’ve already read that that was a bad idea in this sub for several reasons (5% load, average expense ratio, etc).

That said, I’m currently trying to see if I can move my Roth IRA to Vanguard. I’m still not sure if I can do the same with the SIMPLE IRA account. Anyway, throughout my career, I expect to move into the 28% bracket at some point.

My main confusion is with how these IRAs are treated. I’ve read SIMPLE IRA contributions are limited at $12K (for 2014), while the Roth IRAs are limited at $5.5K. Should I contribute more to the SIMPLE or max out the Roth like I’ve read in similar “401K vs Roth” posts? Furthermore, since both are IRAs, from a Federal standpoint, are contributions to the Roth counted towards the $12K limit?


In case it's relevant, this is my current situation:

	•	Telecom engineer in my late 20s.
	•	85K salary in California.
	•	18K in student debt (Nelnet-managed @6.8%)
	•	8K in vehicle debt @2.5%
	•	“Good” credit.
	•	Recently married. No kids. Spouse brings in substantially less.

TL;DR: Invest more in SIMPLE or Roth?",finance,1393217156

personalfinance,Need help prioritizing debt as small business owners,"Husband graduated from law school last year, so we're unsurprisingly up to our eyeballs in debt. Last September we took a risk and opened a solo practice with very little overhead. It's paying off, and we finally have some money to work with. We also have another small business as a wedding vendor that has been profitable, and I keep a couple days a week at my retail job for benefits/a lifeline should we need steady work. 


Our debts are currently as follows:  
*  $12k in credit card debt (~20% average APR)  
*  $130k in student loans (mostly 6-8%, no payment on PAYE)  
*  $12k in car loan (7%), which we want to sell and get loans for 2 cars at a better interest rate, 10-12k total (we *really* need 2 cars for the wedding business)


I have 2k in a rollover IRA, 7k in a 401(k). We have 1k in emergency funds in our personal checking account, and keep a cushion of 3-4k in our business account that we could pull from in a pinch.


The standard advice seems like it would be to keep a small emergency fund and throw everything into debt and not worry about retirement savings for a while.


I feel like being self-employed throws a wrench into this for two reasons. One, the emergency fund seems pretty important here. We don't have kids and we rent, so we avoid those risk factors. Our bare bones expenses are ~3.5k/mo for ourselves, 5k for the businesses (including salary for the single member s-corp law office). We've been scraping by for so long that I'm tempted to keep our efund minimal, but I know that's risky.


Second, self-employment taxes kill. The law practice is new and it's hard to say how much we'll do. Judging by the taxes we paid on it for Sept-Dec of 2013, we're going to be given the choice between feeding an IRA or the IRS.


My plan right now is to  
1) attack credit cards  
2) pay minimum on cars if the new interest rate is under 5%  
3) get efund up to 10k total between business and personal checking  
4) split extra income, half to student loans and half to the efund with the excess to be contributed to a Roth IRA at the end of the year (plus SEP if we hit the Roth max)


I doubt we'll qualify for PAYE for 2015, so we'll start the hefty student loan payments then and be in a better position to handle them. I'm new to financial planning however and would appreciate any ideas and entertain most insults. Also, thoughts on using the Roth IRA funds for a down payment on a house in a couple years?

personalfinance,Therapist urging bankruptcy 26/F,"I am trying to recover from very bad decisions I made while self medicating a mental illness with alcohol, food, and buying things I didn't need vs paying my bills and being responsible. I had a nervous breakdown and just went completely out of control after shit got real. Lost my car, basically kicked out of school, and finally needed hospitalization. I started therapy and medication and then decided on my own that I was well and didn't need either, so I stopped both. Of course I essentially relapsed and got myself into worse trouble. I now have a new job make $16.98/hr and got back to biweekly therapy sessions and stronger medication. My therapist is strongly urging me to consider bankruptcy for my debts and to get a fresh start since becoming stable. We have agreed that I'm now ok to decrease my bi-weekly visits to monthly visits. I have also gotten a packet of information from a bankruptcy lawyer. As of March 2014:

*Net monthly income 1688.76  
  
*Rent $415

*Internet $41

*State Student Loans $111 (9k)

*Federal Student Loans $177 (59k)

*Groceries $50

*Car $380
 
*Gas $80

*Hospital Payment Plan $215(8k)

*Parking $75

*Electricity/Heat $80 payment plan ($448) and past due $201

*Car Insurance $87

*Therapy cost after insurance $90 (down from $180)

*Medication $25


*Accounts Currently in Collections

*Credit Card 1 $514.73

*Credit Card 2 $843.55 (incl judgement,got a letter saying they may garnish my wages)

*Credit Card 3 $223

*Rent from eviction in 2008 $1,038.23

*Verizon $671.76

*Car Reposession $7,268.79 (judgement in jan 2013)

*Speeding ticket $290

*Remaining Tuition owed to school $364.56

*Private Student Loan $6,755.39

*Payday Loan Group $503.09

*Things to consider:

*I have discussed getting a second job with my therapist and he does not think that it would be good for me to do so right now. I haven't been at this new job long so he wants to make sure I'm going to be able to handle this job before adding another.

*I know I can't get rid of any student loan debt with bankruptcy. I'm not sure how I should even handle the debt collection agency has now. I tried contacting Citibank weeks prior to receiving the letter to get the balance and try to set up some sort of payment plan but they told me the balance had been charged off but they didn't know who the balance was sent to and to call back ""in a few weeks.""  I know I can't get rid of the speeding ticket either. I was planning on just getting that paid off by making the payment directly with the District Court (it's an out of state ticket). 

*My current vehicle was a decision out of desperation and stupidity. I got the new job and didn't have a vehicle.  I went to a Buy Here Pay Here place and they let me do deferred payments for a downpayment of $2300 in monthly payments of $380 (biweekly $190). My interest is 19.99% for a 36 month loan. I signed off $400 of my 2013 tax return upon filing at that time to finish off the $2300 down, and now I'm in repayment for the 36 month plan. 

*My city has a shitty public transportation system that doesn't run past 6pm M-F or at all on Sundays. I work 2nd shift thus get off at midnight and I work Sundays. I looked into the fact that I'm more than likely going to have to ditch the car. In the event I stay on the same shift I will have to pay $40/mo for a 31 day bus pass and then the after hours service which is $5/a ride. Public trans/after hours service doesn't run on holidays so I'd have to take a cab or walk. I'm ok with walking in Spring, Summer, Fall, or even getting a bike. I live in the Midwest, so Winters are going to be really, really tough. Shifts are determined by rank, I start and end the latest, not counting 3rd shifters. We will be bidding on new shifts in May and new shifts will start in June.

*I've been quoted a possible $500 out of pocket cost after insurance for dental work I need done for fillings and a crown and my IUD is due to come out this year. While I can just opt to not get a new one, I will have to pay whatever insurance doesn't pay, to get it taken out later this year. I've got about 8 months left. Yay menstruation! 

*The bankruptcy lawyer I talked to offers a payment plan: Four biweekly payments of $250 and then a final payment of $350 at final meeting for a total of $1,350.00. My idea was to take my state return of $618 which is supposed to come around the time of a paycheck with overtime on it and pay my rent to get me to May and my electric bill in full, get ahead on my internet bill a couple months, and then have the money to pay my lawyer off faster.


These are the debts and things I've been able to gather in a few days. There may actually be more private student loans I haven't been contacted regarding. Any help is greatly appreciated. It's my first post so I'm hoping the formatting is ok!

**Edit: I am so sorry!! I completely messed up the student loan part. It was supposed to read 59k owed and not 79k!!** Thanks so much for the responses, I'll try to give a little more info too. I have looked into moving closer to work. There are tons of apartments near my job but it is down town, they are all either designated for low income housing and I make too much and don't qualify, or they're condos for purchasing. There's only one place that is actually across the street from my job but they start at $600 for a studio. I don't know if I could afford that. My rent was lower last year at $390 before they increased me. My lease is up in August so I'll try to keep an eye out to move. 

I don't have any friends or family that can help me. My family is done with me because they've bailed me out twice before and don't believe in therapy or medication so I am alone in this. Carpooling with a coworker will not be an option for me until June with the next shift bid because like I said before I am the last to come in and the last to leave. I do see a consensus about getting rid of my car to free up some income so I will start preparing for that. I will also call the hospital to see about lowering that payment!  I'm pretty worried about whether filing for bankruptcy is the right thing to do and how I should handle the private loan that has gone to collections.",finance,1393238399

Bitcoin,MtGox: Lets take an impartial look at this for a second.,"A realisation comes to mind regarding MtGox.. and that is, most people are Sheep. They follow the crowd, believe what everyone else believes and says what everyone else says.  
 
Saying something different puts oneself at risk of being, a) wrong, b) isolated from peers. 
  
Given the recent (and longer term) on going shouting of (in)Solvency posts regarding MtGox.. I feel the need to put things into a slightly more impartial, and balanced perspective.  
   
 
 

**USD Withdrawal Issues**  
   

* This has been on going since the feds ""Seized"" loads of MtGox's customers funds because they didn't comply with their AML (which btw.. are worth what exactly anyway?). People could still receive SEPA and JYP transfers.. but USD were getting more and more back logged.. also due to the banking restrictions put in place by their bank on how much USD they could move per day. They told everyone about this and lets be honest, it's common knowledge the banking cartels of the world are not extending open arms to help bitcoin businesses. MtGox also approach Bitstamps bank and such, who also said they were not looking to take on any more bitcoin businesses. 
   

  
**Bitcoin Withdrawals**  
  

* **The Invalid transactions** issue has been going on, 'marginally' for a long time. Since a bitcoin update, this issue got exponentially worse for them... to point where they were creating invalid transactions by the bucket load. The situation got so bad... It only made sense for them to stop the repeated requests (which were failing anyway and taking up support time) while they fixed the issue at hand.  
  
* **They're still sending fiat withdrawals** . . as has been pointed out recently.. fiat withdrawals are still being sent out.
  
* **Github logs** as per github logs and such, we can see Karpeles has been actively engaging in working on a solution. He has not just done nothing. He has been active. 

* **MtGox BTC Tx php page** .. we can see MtGox have been implementing the new ntxid into their website as per the api page... why would they even bother doing this if they had no intention to continue and implement withdrawals ? 
  
* **Stolen bitcoins** ~ alot of people have been claiming, as per the Andreas video that MtGox lost some funds due to this bug... well.. firstly, Andrea's said they lost some funds... but not alot and maybe he doesn't really know ? But also what we must keep in mind is that you have to be verified to withdraw BTC from MtGox... so if someone was withdrawing 1000's btc's at a time and using the same bug to steal BTC... it would be very obvious and they'd know exactly who it was. The ""proving they stole it"" argument is pretty much blown out the water if you dealing with 100 BTC+'s in withdrawal per time IMO and would put the person doing the withdrawal at significant risk..  
  
* **Virtual Office** ~ We know Mtgox has moved office.. and some are claiming to a 'Virtual Office'.. but this is only more doom mongering baseless speculation. The office their moving into has both virtual and normal offices. 
    
* **Roger Ver** said he was happy to buy all MtGox BTC... yes, he also changed his desc in his video say he was not saying MtGox is solvent, but this was him merely covering himself because the video is a) old, b) regarding fiat and c) Was getting alot of shit from it.. and he probably doesn't know 100% so just playing it safe. 

* **Shrem** has said good things is coming for Gox. Again, possibly insider move.. but risk reward on this would not be worth it IMO. 
  
* **Karpeles** has personally dipped into his own pocket before to bail out customers... this is more than most people would do and IMO is a sign of integrity... something which could also be reflected in the recent move to step down from the bitcoin foundation.
  
* **Nobody really knows** .. what the current state of the accounts are.. sure, we know the fee's are high, the revenue is good.. and the costs will be low (vs the income).. but all this talk of 'insolvency' is entirely baseless given no one actually knows anything by fact. Only baseless speculation.
  
* **Deleted twitter feed** .. this could coincide with Karpeles knowing Gox has been removed from X's sites regarding BTC (price index) and so on.. and knows that for Gox to live.. He might have to step down so as to restore confidence in more competent management running the operation. This would explain the deleting of the twitter posts for the 're-branding' exercise as theorised by someone else.  Someone also said ""but who'd want to buy Gox""... well, given Gox goes up.. al other exchanges Go up.. Gox goes down.. all other exchanges Go down...  Gox has more fiat and BTC than any other exchange. . and is the #1 quoted price by other sites including cnbc and so on...  Gox is also incredibly profitable.. and for VC's who want exposure to the bitcoin space without the risk of buying bitcoin themselves.. they love exchanges.. and I'm sure they'd be more than few who'd want to take over and more competently run MtGox. 
  
  
  
**Burden of Proof**  
There are 2 burdens of proof that must be applied to make a claim IMO... a civil burden of proof.. and criminal burden of proof.  
  
**Civil Burden of Proof** ~ Must be more likely than not.  
Eg: Is it more likely than not that MtGox is insolvent given everything above ? You decide.
  
**Criminal Burden of Proof** ~ Must be beyond all reasonable doubt.  
Eg: Is it beyond all reasonable doubt that MtGox is not insolvent. If can prove doubt. Then they cannot be guilty.   
  
  
My position: I am undecided. I'd like to see Gox taken over by new more competent management.. but firstly. I just want my BTC back.",cryptocurrency,1393240966
personalfinance,"30M, 71K student loan debt, recently became fully self-employed (~200k per year in the Midwestern U.S.), no savings, no retirement, bad spending habits. I could use some help.","The title pretty well sums things up. For my income, my situation is shameful--I know. I used to have a decent savings (usually around $10,000) but have repeatedly applied it toward paying off loan debt (my total debt was around $120k a few years ago). 

Basically, I'd like help getting my spending under control, as I am an emotional spender from a lower middle-class family that never taught me how to handle money. I need some way to constrain my day-to-day purchasing power so that I know I'm living well beneath my means. I suppose I'd rather find a way to earn more and save more rather than going the altogether frugal route (I like being able to eat out some), but my current situation is obviously absurd. I'm providing more information below and will provide more as requested. Thanks for any help you could prefer. 

* Income: $3,846/week; $15,384/month; ~$200,000/year (I've been making greater than $100k for some time now but only recently became self-employed and am not certain as to how to handle all this money. I just figured I'd pay half my profits toward quarterly taxes and expect a tax refund later. This is probably stupid, I know.)
* Rent w/utilities: $840/month
* Gym: $20
* Car Insurance: ~$100/month (when paid six months at a time)
* Therapy: ~$400/month

Where things get incredibly sketchy is my discretionary spending.

* I spend probably $150 per month on cups of coffee.
* I spend at least $1000 a month eating out--no alcohol. (Honestly . . . I have no friends, am in a dysfunctional relationship, and just like being out among other people.)
* I spend probably $100 per month on books on Kindle/Audible. (I would largely attribute to this--i.e., lots of self-education--my good income. For all of the money I've spent on personal-finance-related texts, you think I'd make smarter decisions with my money, though.)
* I spend at least $100 per month on iTunes (movies, albums, etc.).


Other miscellaneous item:

* Prior to becoming self-employed, I paid around $1,000 per week on my student loans' principle.
* I've saved nothing for retirement because I figure it would make more sense just to pay off said loans first.
* My student loan debt is my only debt. I could probably pay it off within the year if I got my shit together.



Edit:

My goals

* Pay off my debt.
* Save for retirement (I likely will not retire, though).
* Build a multi-million-dollar business within the next five years. (Okay, this is admittedly beyond the scope of Personal Finance.)

Edit 2:

* The average interest rate of all my student loans is 4.5%. There is one loan--for $2,600--that's at 7.5% interest. I'll be paying it off in a couple of weeks.
* Also, I'll more realistically be paying $1,600 per week ($6,400 per month) toward my loans, now that I make so much more than I was three months ago.",finance,1393241962
personalfinance,Car leasing - why would the dealer overstate residual value?,"Hi - I'd never leased a car before, but I took my very naive mother-in-law to the dealer on Saturday to lease her a car.  I was along because my 70-year-old Mom-in-Law is a widow and got hosed on her last car purchase 10 years ago.

So I read some articles and made a spreadsheet to model out a few scenarios to use during negotiation.  It seemed to me that negotiable drivers of the lease payment are:  1) assumed new car price, 2) car residual value (what it's worth when you turn it in), 3) interest rate, and 4) down payment/value of the trade.  Essentially what you are doing is determining depreciation (new car value - residual value) and applying an interest rate to it (plus some fees) to get to your payment.

My question is this:  the dealer's calculation assumed the car's residual value was about $15K (about 58% of the new car price), whereas cars.com indicated it would be closer to $12K (46% of new car price).  I'd read best practice in estimating value after 36 months of leasing was 45%-55%, so 58% seems high.  Why would the dealer over-state residual value?  This shrunk our lease payment considerably, and seems not in their best interest.  The only explanation I can come up with is that the dealer wants to tell a good story about this car having good resale value to help them sell cars, versus lease them.

End of the story is a good one.  We negotiated our trade, dealer offered a bunch of incentives/bonus cash to reduce car price, and I feel we got a good deal...a nice car with nothing down (other than her trade) for a lease payment of $180/month...well within her budget.

personalfinance,0% interest car loan. Help!,"Hi all!

So, I'm considering buying a NEW car. Why new? Well, it might actually save me money. I'd love some help muddling through it.

So I'm considering buying a car. I was going to buy it ""mildly used"" directly from the previous owner through a craigslist type service (most people do this here in Israel). So I went to test drive the car at the dealership to see if I liked it, and the saleslady showed me a really interesting payment plan...

Basically, I have the option of a no money down 0% interest finance loan. It doesn't go up based on national ""prime"" interest rates or based on inflation. So if my monthly payment is, say, $100 the first month, it'll still be $100 on month 60 (in a 5 year loan).

So why does it seem to me like this is quite possibly worth it? I'll explain:

1) Full warranty. This is a very reliable car, but a full warranty is good.

2) Known car background. No chance of hijinks on a 0km brand new car, such as the former owner ""forgetting to mention"" something.

3) Financial reasons: So if I delay as much of the payment for the car as long as possible, it seems to me that I benefit greatly from inflation. IE, the $100 monthly in 2014 dollars will most likely be the equivalent of much less in 2019. So, although my absolute monthly payment will stay the same, its relative value and buying power will decrease, meaning that by delaying paying for the car I've saved money. It's convoluted, but if I understand how inflation works, I think I've got it right.

4) I get that happy new car feeling and get to choose the color. The color I love is very very rare on the second hand market.


So before you say it, yes, I will quadruple check the small print. But for the moment, let's assume I understand the financing agreement correctly. My questions are:

1) can anyone help me out in calculating how much I'd save or lose? I'd be able to compare that to a projected devaluation of the car, though I tend to drive my cars into the ground (I don't really resell, I just drive em. I work with animals, so the interiors take a trashing and I truly can't afford a truck).

2) If I've got the above right, wouldn't it make more sense to take the downpayment and put it into an index fund and take the no money down option, maximizing my monthly? Then, later, I use that money and its profits to pay off the inflation deprecated car payments and pocket the difference.



LAST: Here's why I'm having so much trouble with the above: My instinct has always been, if you have to take a loan, make it a short one and keep the monthly as low as you can. After all I do my finances based on a monthly schedule, not a 5 year schedule. Taking a 0% no money down loan would leave me with a bigger monthly, and getting the 5 year loan makes it a part of my life for the next half decade... That just makes me feel queazy!

personalfinance,following the 'rules' vs pragmatism,"First time homebuyers here trying to decide on which mortgage. 

Details:

* 120k gross + wife gets some overtime
* ~40k student loans around 6%
* No other debts. Middle credit scores are 778 and 727.
* House price on contract 164k to close in April.
* Liquid cash 27k. 

Have a large refund (~4k) coming because I was withheld at single rate last year before marriage and wife didnt have a good income most of year. Very conservative budget projections put us at 35k by closing time.

We are looking at a 15 year fixed and considering only putting 10% down to keep a good emergency fund ready to go. 

So the options we're looking at are:

* 3.375% for par and monthly pmi of 35 bucks
* 3.625% with lender paid pmi, closing costs
* 4% with lender paid pmi, closing costs, and 1300 credit.

And anywhere in between. The only catch is on lender paid PMI, lender pays the full cost of PMI (~1670) whereas on monthly we would reach 80% in about 2 years and pay about 800 total... which is our current rent...

So, mathematically, yes lowest interest rate is best and credits aren't worth it. But practically speaking, we have an option for a $4261 credit (includes the PMI coverage) which would cost us an additional $6590.30 in interest over 15 years. 

Considering the situation (high income, low liquidity) I'm inclined to take the credit and have a larger emergency fund.

personalfinance,Please help me understand how to sell/buy a house,"My wife and I are both 31, we've got 2 little kids, and we're exploring the housing market, looking to upgrade before interest rates get back up again. It seems like this might be the time to sell our current house (worth ~$200k) and get a new house with 3 bedrooms on one level which is more adjacent to parks/schools to raise our kids in (currently 2.5 yrs and 4 months old). We would be looking to spend no more than $300k, probably less, for a modest home in a nice area. We currently make about $130k/year as a couple.

Without discussing whether this move would, on the whole, be advisable (this is a subject of discussion between us currently, we're still mulling it over, there are many aspects to consider, I know), how does the whole deal work? My main question is regarding down payment.

Right now we have about $50k in the bank on top of $10k emergency money and ~$40k equity in our house. We also have ~$110k across retirement accounts, but we have no intention of tapping that money. I don't understand how one ""applies"" current equity to a new house purchase, mostly in the interest of avoiding PMI. When people upgrade houses, do they usually save up the 20% separate from equity or are there some other tricks I don't know about?

In my imagination, we would go find a house we like, make an offer, and set closing for a while out, at which point we would list and hopefully sell our house. There would probably be some overlap there where we would have 2 houses, which would make me very hesitant to put down the full $50-60k required for a proper down payment, but I don't understand how it is otherwise done.

My two specific questions (in addition to any observations or questions from the information above):

1. Should I scale up/down my Roth 401k contributions? I have $800/mo I've been putting into my taxable brokerage account that could be going into my Roth 401k. However, there is no match upside and my fund options through my employer's plan are pretty weak and have high-ish expense ratios. I've been earning a much better return in my brokerage account and I like the increased choices (I'm loving FBIOX). Should I take $5.5k of my emergency fund and max out a Roth IRA?

2. I want to buy house within the next 5 years, so aside from having a liquid emergency fund, I've held off on paying off my student loans to build credit, hoping to have a high 700s score by the time I'm ready to take out a mortgage. I've paid extra each month to try to walk the line between paying interest and building credit and I've been earning returns above the loan interest rate in both my brokerage (even accounting for taxes) and my Roth 401k. Should I reconsider my strategy?

Bitcoin,The Brighter Side of Failure,"I think it worthwhile to point out and reinforce the positives I'm seeing coming out of this Mt Gox debacle.  A lot of us already believe this: failure is good.  But we live in a society that is so petrified of failure, even we in the Bitcoin community sometimes struggle to understand what a single failure can mean for the eco-system as a whole.  

This post:

http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/77745633839/bitcoins-apocalyptic-moment-mt-gox-may-have-lost#disqus_thread

Is a good example of the panic that a single point of failure now induces on people.  Shell shocked by the excesses of Wall Street - we now perceive ALL risk as systemic.  This is a pathological state of mind induced by a pathological subsection of society (the banksters).  They should never serve as any kind of yardstick.

Here are some of the very significant positives I see in the Bitcoin eco-system, which look even better when you compare them to what happens on Wall Street.

1) While many are looking to the government and the courts to seek redress against Mt Gox (as is their right), still I see an even greater sense of personal responsibility displayed by Bitcoin investors.  Everyone going forward is going to do the due diligence required on any company with which we do any bitcoin related business.  Who are these people, what are their histories, who are they funded by, how transparent are they, what are the political realities of the countries out of which they operate? etc.  These are not concerns that people engaging with modern finance (and I mean at the simple everyday banking level with which Bitcoin is trying to compete).  Their deposits are insured.  Government regulations protect them from having to care to a very large degree - until of course that sense of security is proven to be false and governments start confiscating savings as many are explicitly planning to do.

2) The onus on the individual to take care of themselves leads to a spontaneous cultural re-enforcement of appropriate behaviour.  We as a community will not accept bad actors and will punish those that fail to meet our shared expectations.  They will be punished - if not with legal sanction - then by (at the very least) - community revulsion and the lack of our business.  I see this every day on Reddit - with many still acting blind (people have been warning about Mt Gox for a very long time - with many never listening - but now taking more seriously the possibility of a hostile world.  Compare this to Wall Street which sustains a persistent culture of corruption at the worst, and at best a culture that remains disturbingly isolated from reality:

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/i-crashed-a-wall-street-secret-society.html

This is only possible, I believe because main street communities don't need to be involved with the financial realities that govern their lives.  Bitcoiners are active, engaged and motivated to weed out the bad actors in our community - because we have to be.

3) All of this leads to a high degree of motivation on the part of those leading our community to do a better job at showing that they are meeting our expectations.  Hence we see moves by Coinbase and others to achieve greater transparency and demonstrate their solvency.  Could you ever imagine such a thing from Wall Street?  Or even the institutions like the Federal Reserve who did nothing but obfuscate the truth about the state of the various institutions it was managing (it repeatedly fought freedom of information requests by Bloomberg).  We demand not that our leading institutions open their books to a set of easily corruptible, elite government bureaucrats - but to the entire community.  We want a direct, unmediated relationship with the companies with which we do business.  We demand it.  And from what I can see - this is beginning to happen.  

So as a conclusion and TLDR:  Failure has good results that make us stronger.  It increases our self-responsibility,  our sense of shared community, and an increased sense of connection between ourselves and the businesses that lead our community.",cryptocurrency,1393303173
personalfinance,Feedback on placing ~12k into an RRSP before deadline [Canada]?,"xposting from /r/personalfinancecanada

Hi, I was hoping to get some feedback from some more experienced people on my plan - just in case I am overlooking anything.

My taxable income is nearly 56k this year and for various reasons I have a large chunk sitting in a High Interest Savings Account with RBC, roughly 15k in total. I was just wondering if there are any drawbacks to me dumping a large amount of it into RRSP in order to place myself in the [lowest federal tax bracket](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html) and getting a decent refund back.

Utilizing the [Home Buyers Plan](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/rrsp-reer/hbp-rap/menu-eng.html) or the [Lifelong Learning Plan](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/rrsp-reer/llp-reep/menu-eng.html) both seem like very real options to me in the near future, so I can't see any reason why I would regret making this decision.

My current RRSP plan with RBC is a ['Savings Deposit'](http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/products/savings-deposit/) which earns essentially 0 interest (I have nearly no money in it - I can't remember the details, but RBC stops charging you fees if you have X investments with them or something like that) so I am planning on setting up an appointment to look into better plans.

Any advice or feedback is greatly appreciated, thanks!

UPDATE: So I've read up on a handful of things, mainly with the Home Buyers Plan. The one big drawback I realized is that, if I use the the Home Buyers Plan AND move up a tax bracket at all (which I optimistically plan on), I will not be able to realize any tax deductible refund from my RRSP contributions until I pay back the amount I withdrew when I bought a future property. So basically, I can deposit now, get a modest refund, utilize the home buyers plan, then I won't be able to receive any tax refund on my (theoretically) harsher taxed future income until I repay the funds I withdrew.

I guess, when it comes to RRSPs, the idea is you should never really withdraw unless you find yourself in a lower tax bracket - even if you are using something like the HBP or LLP",finance,1393308898
Bitcoin,Follow up: My research survey on bitcoin,"Hi everyone,

My name is Caitlin Lustig (contact: clustig@uci.edu).  I’m a PhD student in the Informatics department at the University of California, Irvine and I am studying the Bitcoin community.  Some months ago, I put out a survey here (http://redd.it/1ojfxx) and Bitcoin Forum (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=311261.0).  I had intended to give some preliminary results shortly after my survey was completed, but analyzing the results took much longer than expected.   However, I am happy to say that I finally have some results that I can share with you.

First, though, a few notes:

I will be gathering more data in the form of interviews and will be doing more analysis over the next few months.  I’ll be sure to share any papers that I publish with the community!  Also, a big thank you again to everyone who participated in my survey.

Some people have asked me whether I will share my data with them.  Unfortunately, I cannot and will not share the full dataset.  It is really important to me to keep the participants as anonymous as possible.

Lastly, I know that I could really only reach people who know English with this survey, so I recognize that these results cannot necessarily be generalized to the entire Bitcoin community.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS:

Number of people who took the survey: 510

Observations based on open-ended questions:

1.	Many of the participants were very against the use of Bitcoin for illegal purposes.  I did not ask about illegal activity in my survey, but many people volunteered their opinion on the matter and stated that they felt dismayed that the community has been associated with illegal activities by media outlets.  They felt that many people outside of the community misunderstand why someone would be motivated to use Bitcoin and tried to clear up this misinformation when speaking to non-Bitcoin users.

2.	As for participant’s motivation, many stated that they liked Bitcoin because it is not tied to any government and it offers some degree of anonymity.  Some also stated that they did not trust credit card companies, payment intermediaries like PayPal, or banks, and Bitcoin offered an alternative to all of these institutions.  Another thing that came through in the survey was the participants’ excitement in being a part of something that they found cool, novel, and fun.  Fun was not necessarily a word that I expected to see in the results (or one that I see associated with Bitcoin often in news articles) and I’m interested to learn more about what makes Bitcoin fun for people!

3.	When asked about the future of Bitcoin, many participants had very high hopes that Bitcoin would revolutionize monetary systems across the world.  However, some participants expressed concern about government regulations in the future and some perceived weakness in the design of Bitcoin (i.e. lack of absolute anonymity and centralization through large mining pools).  They expressed the belief that a different crypto-currency would solve these issues in the future.  These participants seemed to indicate that they weren’t committed to Bitcoin, per se, but to the promise and value of crypto-currencies in general.

Demographics:

Most of the participants were between 25 and 34 years old, heterosexual, atheist or agnostic, American, and male.  The political beliefs were varied and many participants chose multiple political labels for themselves.  For those that selected at least one political label for themselves, nearly 60% selected libertarian.  However, the open-ended question about political beliefs revealed that many participants had differing opinions about what these labels meant and many rejected labels or felt uncomfortable identifying with any particular label.  I think, as a result, it might be unfair to characterize the participants as primarily libertarian, as the open-ended question revealed that the political views of the participants much more varied and nuanced than a label could describe.

Bitcoin,Gox and other things: Money which you do not control is not yours,"Hello fellow Redditors,

As the Mt. Gox story unfolds, and bitcoin awaits media crucifixion, a truely free market lives on. While the price of bitcoin suffers, media punditry calls bitcoin's untimely death and politicians find a stand to be grand upon, the results are exactly as they should be: an incompetent and insolvent institution is rewarded with failure and those whom did not understand the risks they took are dealt a tough lesson.

This is not to say I'm happy about these events. I don't rejoice in the loss of others. Many people will lose much more than they could afford to lose, and as far as silver linings go, it's hard to find many. Death and loss are a part of life, and too often we find positive ways to spin it. There really aren't any, it just sucks.

Comparatively, we can look to the the banking crisis of 2008 and see a very different allocation of losses. When incompetence and failure proliferated through the financial system, those who were responsible were rewarded with financial support at the cost of the greater community. In the United States and internationally, the banking system came incredibly close to a full blown bank run. Few people recognize how close the system came to failure and Mt. Gox serves well as a reminder. Less than three weeks ago, a bitcoin on Mt. Gox was priced at over $900. Bank runs and financial collapse happen quickly.

The solution in 2008? Print money in order to cover the balance sheet shortfalls. Additionally, interest rates were cut in order to spur short-term lending costs, increase borrowing and provide liquidity and inflation to counteract the deflationary effect of a contracting economy. The end result of this is that all of those who possessed cash, paid for the incompetency of those responsible through the debasement of the currency. The abstract and indirect nature of inflation hides the true cost to those paying, and those responsible aren't held accountable. As a result, this newly created moral hazard and the cheapening of credit to alleviate short-term pain, paradoxically only makes these events more likely to occur.

Those who lost money at Mt. Gox aren't likely to find much solace in this, but there are lessons to be learned from this debacle, the most poignant being this: **money which you do not control is not yours.** There is not a single financial truism that I find more appropriate than this. Whether lending money to a family member or friend, a bank or buying equity in a business, the point at which you take responsibility for the risk of loss occurs at the change of possession.

Whether speeding down the highway, throwing a baseball around a window or not understanding the signs of financial insolvency, risks are generally only realized and learned through failure. This is also a part of life, and the only way many (most especially myself), have come to learn anything.

It is unfortunate that so many will lose so much, but in the end, the responsibility and cost of this failure will lie exactly where it should, and not on those who weren't involved, either by chance or understanding. This is a true and free economy, one that saddens and gives me great hope all at the same time.

Thanks for reading,

Bitcoin,Other Bitcoin players bailing out MtGox is not the same as bailing out banks by a central bank with public money or printing money,"If other leaders of the Bitcoin world are taking over MtGox to help organize the possible liquidation of the company that is not really acting like a central bank, but like private individuals trying to contain a crisis that could certainly be worse than warranted because of market psychosis.

In this case rather than a central bank they are acting like JP Morgan in the 1907 NY financial crisis. This is different because they would be pledging private money and not public/tax payers money and they would not be incurring in money printing like a central bank does probably putting at risk the integrity of the currency and for sure diluting the value saved by the rest of the public.

In the US it is unnoticed the effect of the Fed by printing massive amounts of money because of the huge adoption of the dollar not only within the large US economy, but also the rest of the world.

But it is much more felt in less developed economies like Argentina where small amounts of new money issuance are nearly immediately rejected by the economy creating high inflation and currency devaluation.

In the case of Bitcoin private “community” intervention with private money to support the platform seems more adequate than having public money or money issuance. This s because the distribution of risk, costs, and potential earnings are assigned by the “market” to the corresponding people who run the risks. In traditional central banking systems the risk is run by a few bankers, they earn the upside returns, but the potential losses are distributed to the population creating a clear “moral hazard”.

Moral hazard promotes higher risk taking and returns to the few who are subsequently protected, this inexorably leads to bigger crisis overtime.",cryptocurrency,1393311904

personalfinance,Your Credit and You: Basic Information,"Credit cards, credit scores, and credit reports are one of the most-discussed topics in /r/personalfinance.  The following is a summary of the basics you need to know about credit and how you should use it.   I also address some common questions about credit cards.  If you see something that isn't correct or have suggestions on other things to add, please let me know in the comments or by private message.  This post does not presume to be ""definitive"" - you could write volumes on the intricacies of the credit system.

##tl;dr please.

Never carry a balance on a credit card past your statement due date.  Pay off your balance in full, every month by the statement due date.  Do not take out loans you don't need for the sake of improving your credit score, and do not carry a balance because you think you need to in order to improve your credit score.

##What is a credit score?  How does it affect me?

Your credit score is an aggregate of a number of different factors that, when put through an algorithm, spit out a number that indicates how suitable you are to extend a loan to.  People with good credit scores get the most competitive interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, etc.  The lower the interest rate, the less money the loan will cost you.  Credit scores are also used as a factor in determining one's suitability for renting a place to live or for employment.  While there are a number of different entities that calculate your credit score, the most prevalent is the [FICO score](http://www.myfico.com/).  This post is oriented towards the FICO score, but the general principals are applicable to most other credit scoring systems as well.

##What's the best way to get a good credit score?

**The single most important factor in any credit score is a history of on-time payments.**  Note that ""on-time"" does not necessarily mean ""in full"" - you are expected to pay the amount due each billing period based on whatever payment plan you are on.  The monthly billing cycle is certainly one of the most common.  The best way to improve your credit score is therefore to ensure that you are meeting the minimum payments on all of your debts.

The second important factor is total amount owed across all of your lines of credit.  This is commonly referred to a utilization ratio.  In general, a lower utilization ratio is better for your credit score's health.  Utilization has no history, however, so only the last month's balance on your credit card (for example) is used in the calculation.
The other factors that go into a FICO score are length of credit history, types of credit (credit diversity), and how many ""new accounts"" you have.

##How does XYZ affect my credit score?

* Opening new credit cards/applying for new lines of credit - Applying for new credit cards requires a ""hard inquiry"" into your credit score - that is, a third party accesses your credit score to see if you meet their standards.  This hard inquiry results in a small hit to your credit score.  If you apply for a number of new lines of credit in a short period of time, these hard inquiries can cause a greater hit to your score.  If you are approved for all of the lines of credit you apply for, that can count against you in the ""New accounts"" and ""Length of credit history"" categories.  If you are looking to take out a large loan in the near term (mortgage, auto loan) you should not be looking to open new lines of credit.  Your score will not have time to recover from the effect of the hard inquiries.

* Paying down the balance on a credit card before the statement due date - Paying down your balance early lowers your utilization ratio, as the balance on the statement date is the balance used for utilization purposes.  

* Carrying a balance/stretching out a loan for the sake of credit - **You should not carry a  balance on a credit card to improve your credit score, nor should you stretch out a high interest loan for the sake of improving your credit score.**  The reason is that this costs you money.  You do not need to pay a cent of interest in order to improve your credit score, so pay down those high interest loans as fast as you can.

##What is a credit report?  How do I get mine?

Your credit report lists all of your credit accounts, credit inquiries within the last two years, and public debt information.  You can access your credit report once per year from each of the three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) at [annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com).  It is a very good idea to check one of your reports every 4 months to ensure that no lines of credit are being opened in your name without you knowing about it.  

Some credit monitoring sites such as [CreditKarma](http://www.creditkarma.com) provide a continuously accessible credit report and a simulated credit score.  Simulators like CreditKarma are useful for a ballpark estimate of one's credit score, as long as you appreciate that it is not an official FICO score.  Anecdotal reporting by /r/personalfinance redditors who have compared their CreditKarma score to their actual FICO scores indicate that CK is usually accurate within 30 points or so.

##Why should I care about my credit score?

If you plan on paying for all of your major purchases in cash, it is true that you do not need to care about your credit score.  However, most people don't have the means to make large purchases (houses or cars, for example) in cash.  A good credit score lowers the cost of borrowing money for such purchases, leaving you with more money in your pocket after the loan is paid off.  

In addition to making you more attractive to potential creditors, landlords, or employers, /u/badgertheshit adds that a high credit score can often give discounts for things such as car insurance.  The specifics will depend on your insurer.  /u/JonCheddar notes that a higher credit score also gives you access to the best rewards cards which, if used correctly in the manner described below, basically pay you to spend money you were going to spend anyway.

##How do credit cards work?

Credit cards are far and away the most widespread form of consumer credit in the U.S.  A credit card has a dollar limit per account, up to which the cardholder and their authorized users are allowed to spend before being cut off.  The card issuer is extending an unsecured (i.e. no collateral) loan up to the amount of the card limit for a period of one month.  

Every month the card issuer sends the cardholder a statement, indicating how much money the cardholder has borrowed during that month.  The cardholder typically has about a month to pay the balance before interest is assessed on any remaining balance.  Each statement balance typically has a minimum payment - if the cardholder makes the minimum payment it does not affect the payment history portion of their credit score.  However, interest rates on credit cards tend to be quite high, so card issuers intentionally make the minimum payment low (1% of the balance due is not uncommon) to incentivize people to make the minimum payment to avoid getting a late hit on their credit report but to maximize the balance on which they can charge interest.
Credit card debt is therefore highly destructive to one's financial health due to the high interest rates.  If you are carrying a balance on your credit card, that is a strong indication that you cannot afford whatever you are charging to it.

/u/aceshighsays notes that one strategy to avoid a late payment on your bill is to set up automatic bill pay.  If you do this, it's still a good idea to check your statement monthly for any discrepancies and your bank account before the automatic debit to ensure you don't get into an overdraft situation.  You should make sure that you set the automatic payment to pay your statement balance, not the minimum payment.

##I have no credit history.  How can I start?

One of the most common ways to start building your credit history is to get a secured card.  [Nerdwallet](http://www.nerdwallet.com) is an excellent resource to compare secured cards and find one that is good for your situation.  A secured credit card is backed by collateral - specifically cash in the amount of the card's ""credit"" limit.  A secured card with a $500 limit requires $500 in collateral from you.  
Once you get your secured card, start building your history of on time, in full payments.  A lot of secured cards allow upgrades to unsecured cards after a certain amount of time provided you've shown you can handle the card responsibly.  This can range from 6 months to two years.

##What is a balance transfer?

Balance transfers are exactly what they sound like - transfers of an existing balance from one credit card to another.   A number of credit cards offer 0% interest on balance transfers for a certain period of time (usually a year), which can make them a useful tool to get out of credit card debt.

However, beware of the following issues with balance transfers.  Applying for a 0% balance transfer card costs you a hard inquiry on your credit score.  Occasionally there is a fee to transfer the balance, even if the card you are transferring the balance to has 0% interest.   Finally, if you miss a payment, have a payment returned for insufficient funds (for example if your bank account doesn't have a sufficient balance), or exceed your credit limit you may invalidate the 0% interest offer and have interest applied retroactively to the entire balance transfer.  Check the terms and conditions of any 0% balance card you are considering to make sure you understand the limitations of the offer.

##Conclusion

Good credit can be a very useful thing if treated with appropriate respect and caution.  Hopefully the information above answers some of your questions about credit cards, credit scores, and credit reports - please use the comments if you have additional questions.

Bitcoin,How I nearly lost it all the Gox...,"It was a fairly boring Friday afternoon at work. I'd just got back into crypto currencies, and I was brainstorming ways of making a quick buck out of the whole deal. I mean, I'd stupidly not got on board over a year ago when I was going to. I wasn't gonna wave the train off at the station again. 
It was after about an hour, it came to me. Coins were selling on Gox for £700/BTC. And I could buy them from LocalBitCoins for £520/BTC. Minus fees,  I was still looking at a plus £150 markup per trade. I'd looked into Gox months/years ago,  they were legit. I ran the maths and I reckoned I could do about £2000 an hour. Recycling the money from LBTC to Gox to my bank and back to LBTC again. 

That's when it occurred to me. Gox isn't instant, from when I'd looked into them before, I was looking at a 2 week turn around on funds. So the money I could make,  was from the capital I had, I couldn't recycle the money.

I had £2000 in the bank. And a £2000 overdraft. I knew I could increase my overdraft by £4000. So I had a total of £8000 to work with. I ran the figures, and was looking at a £2500 profit per fortnight. Not the £2k an hour I originally thought I had. But still a lot. 

See this is where I thought I was being clever. BTC aren't huge in the UK like they are in the States and Asia. I was playing the supply and demand game. Moving from the UK with high supply and low demand. To elsewhere, low supply and high demand. It made sense to me,  currently studying my first year of economics. I mean come on, I'd studied this shit. I could see it before my own eyes. I'd hit the jackpot. And I'd studied Gox way back, they were legit, they were the largest BitCoin exchange. What could go wrong.

I increased my overdraft. I bought £8000 worth of coins. I sold them on Gox. And then I waited to get verified. And I waited. And I waited... And I kept on waiting.

After 3 weeks of waiting, I was starting to get itchy. I started looking into Gox. I started reading into Gox, and what I was reading wasn't good. Money seized by the US feds. Long withdrawal times... I wasn't buying BTC for cheap and selling them on the international market for more. I was buying them at market value, and selling them on a trading platform where the currency value (in my case GBP) differentiated from the actual real world value. Shit. 

Shit. Shit. Shit... Stop panicking,  I can sell them back to BTC and transfer out, and sell them back for the same price I bought them for. 

""You need to be verified in order to withdraw BTC.""

Shit.

It's been 5 weeks and I haven't been verified. What is going on.

At this point, I felt cheated. Cheated by Gox, cheated by myself. So I got cheeky. 

Gox AML,  weren't responding. So I pointed out I was interested in opening a corporate account, but wanted to test their facilities first. That I had a large deposit I was looking to put in,  but refused to do so, until I had been verified. The plan was, if they knew they were gonna do a runner, they'd want me to deposit my money, so they could run with it. I was verified the next day.

BitCoin out. Sold on LBTC. Woke up the next day. 

""MtGox denying bitcoin withdrawals.""

I'm £100 worse off than I started. But at one point I came to the realisation I was going to have to accept a possible £8000 loss of money I couldn't afford to lose. There's not much you can do now if your money is in there. And I'm sorry if it is. I got lucky. But if you are reading this. Think before you act. Do your research.

It concerns me that the crypto currencies seem to be all sliding downwards together, and it may be because too many investors mistook Bitcoin for real money instead of seeing it for what it is, a protocol for exchange. To use an analogy with the internet as an example, Bitcoin is like HTML in it's early days. These new protocols have to be useful in the real economy to become widely adopted. 

Lets start throwing around ideas about how this model of currency could revolutionize business and create apps which empower entrepreneurs and investors to meet in an open online market. Kickstarter created a donation craze, but I think it's days are numbered because it's clear that the donors are not treated as investors. A really impactful advance for Shibes and Dogeholders would be an active exchange where talent is traded for Doge in an online auction type environment.

Is it possible that we could actually put people back to work using Doge? Ofcourse it is! Bankers are gettgin knocked off on a daily basis, it's clear that the Banking system is not going to rescue this economy. It's basicly up to us Shibes. So let's go. Lets get coding special exchanges and pools which aim to reconnect communities with a common goal of building a fair exchange of talents, instead of ruthless exploitation.

Possible Ideas
- DOGEstarter-POOL funded type film project. All creatives and crew trade their time for stake in a pool. When the film project is finished, viewers are put behind a Doge-paywall. They pay to watch film in Doge. Each time a viewer pays, the proceeds are divided and pushed to the various wallets based on their share in the pool. Realtime Doge_italism.

-7% loan swop. Shibes meet online and trade loans at agree'd upon prices. Less collateral means higher interest rates etc. Would allow
Shibes to replace the murderous payday loan industry.

I realize these are big fucking ideas Shibes, but plz Troll and chyme in as you like.

Bless this Rant.

Bitcoin,"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.","With all the ""bubble"" concern over in U.S. equityland, I thought I'd do the BTC faithful a favor by creating [a scaled chart for them overlaying BTC 2010-2014 to the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1926-1929](http://imgur.com/a/pjTC5).

As always, it's not enough just to take one ""picture"" and overlay it against the other ([much like people have done here](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/1929-stock-market-chart-fails-to-scare-investors-2014-02-19)).  This approach fails to take into account actual returns.

The right approach is to index the two price series, then reconstruct them based on price returns, [as was demonstrated here in BusinessWeek.](http://www.businessinsider.com/1929-stock-market-crash-chart-is-garbage-2014-2)

So I have done that for all of you.  The DJIA data is daily data [straight from the Federal Reserve](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DJIA).  They do not include re-invested dividends (""Total Return"").  I had considered using Robert Shiller's re-constructed S&amp;P 500 index from 1871 - which contains dividends - but didn't want to get into a nitty-gritty argument about the construction of that index (it's a mosaic of data, not a continuous price feed).  The BTC data is from [Blockchain](http://blockchain.info/charts/market-price).

I did not know what I was going to get from this when I started.  When the data first came out, it was somewhat shocking to learn that the scales didn't even come close to matching up:  In other words, if you thought the DOW in 1929 was a bubble, you're going to love the BTC returns.  I had to ""re-scale"" the BTC vs. DOW chart to separate axes so that they at least ""matched up"" visually.

To illustrate, I included the original chart, which puts the price returns on the same axes.  You'll see what I'm talking about there.

So, that's that.  Enjoy.",cryptocurrency,1393343895

MachineLearning,Can anyone give feedback on an approach to online HTML document classification?,"**TL;DR - If you have operational experience implementing a distributed, online document classification system on a potentially unbounded and constantly growing dataset, care to validate my approach and/or suggest improvements?**

I'd like to sanity-check my approach to solving a fairly large-scale, supervised online document classification problem. The app I've been working on has the following characteristics and goals:

* App crawls websites, stores HTML data
* A document model is produced from each page crawled, based on the non-markup text content of the page
* A classifier provides a relevancy prediction of the crawled HTML content, indicating the likely relevance to our client's core business, along with some kind of accuracy scale to indicate degree of relevance
* Subset of pages crawled from unrecognized domains are presented to users for eventual review, wherein they manually extract relevant features and record the supervised relevancy classification
* Review data is fed back into the ML algorithm which should learn from the supervised classifications and hopefully improve accuracy over time

Constraints: 

* Potentially large set of documents (still in testing and we have over 2 million pages, this will explode once we turn the whole pipeline on full-time) to classify
* ML process needs to be parallelizable, i.e. multiple machines will potentially be handling the learning _and_ prediction steps of the pipeline
* Updating the prediction model shouldn't require access to the entire corpus at once; it's possible to have the whole thing (or subset) available for initial training, but over time the additions to the corpus dataset will be streamed into the pipeline
* Latency is a concern, though we have some wiggle-room here; a few seconds for prediction is acceptable, and that has to include transforming raw HTML content into an appropriate document model
* Most importantly, updating the predictive model should require as little specialized developer interaction as possible; the app is intended to be a turn-key solution for our client, they have very-little in-house development capability, and we don't want to be on the hook for completely retraining their predictive models every month or two

So far, I've considered:

* Solr running on dedicated node + lucene classification API
* VW running on dedicated node in daemon mode performing online updates to the predictor model
* Cloud-based classification service like Alchemy API, et al

The cloud-based stuff is nice because we're a very small shop developing this app, and having a ""magic classification box"" would cut down on engineering and deployment overhead. However, they don't provide enough control/visibility into the classification process, as well as being too expensive.

Solr seems like a good approach, but we're wary of the complexity involved in setting up, administering, scaling, and interacting with the Solr stack. We don't currently want or need the ability to search the crawled data, so it seems like a lot of unnecessary overhead just for a binary text classification task. Assuming it scales, though, this approach does neatly solve the parallelization issue (each pipeline node can query the Solr server for both updates and predictions).

VW seems like it would be ideal for this application, but I'm not sure I'm ""doing it right"". Official documentation seems pretty sparse, and I've read lots of blog/forum/mailing-list posts which offer wildly varying approaches.

To wit:

1. If I run VW in daemon mode, will it handle concurrent streaming updates to the predictor? Can I use the same running daemon for both update and prediction operations?
2. If I use the daemon mode, do I just need to write plain ASCII-formatted examples to the socket daemon socket? Will unicode data work? How do read response data back?
3. Because I don't have a full corpus available, I can't do TF-IDF weighting. Some VW examples I've seen suggest that this isn't necessary. Stemming and stopwords seem like useful pre-processing steps to produce the document model, but apparently VW can do n-grams automatically. What would seem a likely effective document model for an arbitrary website based solely on the content and URL?
4. If I want VW to update the final predictor in a streaming, online fashion, what's the proper VW command-line invocation? They just added the ```--save_resume``` feature, does that do what I want?

Ultimately, the predictions don't have to be extremely precise (both false pos/neg predictions are fine to a degree), but we need the system to scale as the corpus grows and be pretty low-maintenance in the long run. 

If anyone out there has any insight about how best to implement a system like this, I'd very much appreciate it. Does Solr or VW make more sense here? Or something else? If VW is the way to go, can anyone provide a specific example demonstrating how to best process and format an HTML document into a valid VW example, train the predictor using VW daemon, and then perform a classification prediction (returning the classification along with some kind of accuracy metric) using VW? That would be incredibly helpful.",technology,1393375302

software,"Kanban: A cure for what ails me, or snake oil du jour?","I manage a team of developers and testers that makes widgets. We manage several dozen widgets; in addition to creating new widgets, we have to update old ones with new functionality and fix urgent bugs.

The team is understaffed, overworked and burnt out, which of course is never good.

I'm intrigued by kanban for several reasons: (1) People only work on one thing at a time (2) Work in progress is minimized (3) Useful metrics can be extracted.

However, my engineering background has made me very distrustful of buzzwords and  management fads.  I see five stumbling blocks of varying criticality for my potential use case.

1. I can't find much information on how to deal with deadlines under kanban, and we have many deadlines. A Sochi Olympics widget wouldn't have been useful if it was released after the olympics started. How do you manage hard deadlines under kanban?

2. I can't find much information on dealing with tasks of hugely varying sizes. If all we were doing was fixing up bugs and adding small new features, things would be fine. But the aforementioned example of the new Sochi widget takes significantly more time to develop than a bug fix to an existing widget; while it can be broken down somewhat, there are still several very large tasks that need to be done before anything remotely workable is ready. How do you prevent large projects from ""clogging"" your pipeline?

3. How does kanban work if the ""swim lanes"" have differing priorities? If there's a high priority ""swim lane"" for customer-reported bugs, how does one ensure that the right person temporarily drops one task and moves to the high priority task?

4. The pipelines that I usually see have a ""Development"" column and a ""Testing"" column. But if you wait until development of a feature is done before testing begins, you could really drag out the cycle. Should development of tests be tasks of their own, so that they can get started in parallel with development of widgets? If so, this distinction may not always be understood by the project managers who fill the backlog... and therefore doesn't seem to fit cleanly into the kanban model of popping user stories out of the backlog.

5. If multiple tasks are sitting around in different ""Done"" columns, and a developer or tester gets freed up, how does one determine which task gets pulled out of the ""Done"" column? Does kanban treat all tasks within a swim lane as equal in priority, thus leaving it up to the developer which one he wants to pull?

I know some of these questions are elementary, but don't seem to be fleshed out completely in some of the free documentation available. Thanks in advance for any feedback.",technology,1393379207

personalfinance,Am I a crazy idiot or is society oblivious? - Interest paid on mortgages (CA),"The wife and I are looking at buying a bigger house.  We want to have a second kid, and have two bedrooms right now and thus would like a third.

I'm looking at the mortgages we'd need to buy some of the houses in the area, and I can't get past the total Interest Paid.  It doesn't seem to bother anyone else, especially wife.

We bought our house for 150k, and have 66k left on the mortgage.  We figure selling costs would be around 9k, so we have 79.7k in equity.
It seems around here 2 bedrooms means the house is around 150k, but anything decent with 3-4 bedrooms is all of a sudden 250k+.
We found one that's really nice, but not dream-house, for 270k (it's a small town, ok?)

This means we could sell our house and take out a new mortgage for 270-79.7 = 190.3k
Using 4% interest, and an amortization of 18.8 years, the payments are $1200/month (what we're paying now, comfortably).  But the total interest paid is 80k.
80.  Thousand.  Dollars.  (80,000)
[mind you we'd do accelerated biweekly to save 10k]

So we just paid $340,000 for a house worth $270,000, assuming interest rates remain stable [I always thought seeing 1981 prime interest rates would be interesting].  I don't pretend to assume it'll be worth 4% compounded annually more in 19 years when I'm 52... er... damn I'm getting old.

I ask my friends around here (who have similar mortgages) what they think about the total interest paid, and everyone I've talked to seems to gloss it off as ""price for quality of life"", or, ""interest is inevitable"".  Bullshit. Paying interest like this is a choice.  We could stay where we are and pay 6.6k in interest without accelerating payments, and own our house at 35.  But everyone seems to think ""might as well live in a nicer place"".  We do need another bedroom though.

Am I crazy?  Is noone else bothered by paying this much money to the bank?  Everyone seems to do this without mentioning the cost of borrowing the money.
While we're at it, why don't I take out a loan to buy a pair of Lamborghini's with Justin Bieber decals on the hoods so I can ram them into each other on weekends?  Who cares, we'll just put it on low payments!

Obviously the wife is slightly more interest-accepting and risk-accepting than I am, so we're working on a compromise.  I'm currently debating how much of the interest bullet is worth biting to avoid having to move again and pay sales fees, vs happy wife.

Further details.... dreamy house is more like $310k, we make 150k annually, but have ~60k set aside for retirement right now, 30k emergency/savings fund, none of that invested, and really need to work on that.  No other debt but have a hell of a time trying to stick to a budget, making planning difficult.

I know I'm bitching about interest on a 270k house, when I recall a few years ago people were buying 900k properties in Toronto on 40 years mortgages (at 5% / 40 year amort that's about 1.2 million dollars interest paid, btw), 
But seriously, why does noone else seem bothered by this ""hidden"" cost?",finance,1393385932

personalfinance,Question about Home Equity Loan Line and Interest Payments,"Hi there r/personalfinance, 

I just had a quick question that I don't really know who to ask, so I thought asking the semi-pros here would be a good way to go. 

I'm currently taking out a loan through the home equity loan line (that belongs to a close family friend who have graciously given me the loan) and have been since September 2013. I use it to pay for my college tuition and expenses, as right now I am totaled at $19,380 for the principal. 

For the last few months (from October until now, February), I was told that I needed to pay a monthly fee. Here are the (rough) numbers:

October: ~$28
December: ~$32
January: ~$46
February: ~$65

(The reason why it jumped so much between December and January is because I take out a set amount per quarter that I am in school, so 1st quarter = $9690 + 2nd quarter = $9690; this is where I got the $19,380 from). 

I know that the monthly payments should have something to do with the interest rate (I'm waiting on a confirmation for that). SO here's my question:

By the time I finish school, I'll have accumulated $29,070 in school debt. Is this amount set because I had paid the monthly interest (so I will pay $29,070 flat fee after I graduate), or will I still get charged an annual interest rate on TOP of the monthly payments that I've been paying already (so $29,070 + interest rate)? 

I ask this because it makes a HUGE difference in the interest rate I'm paying back. If I'm going to get charged again at the end when my school is finished, I will have to essentially pay for TWICE the original interest amount. 

I don't know if this makes sense or not but I'd be happy to clarify if anyone has questions.

personalfinance,My wife is looking to consolidate her student loans and we need help. X-post from /r/studentloans,"Loans listed below. Sofi offers a 15 year variable and 15 year fixed. She hasn't submitted her information yet to get the rates just yet and wants more.informstion first. All other student loan consolidation services so far have told her thst her debt to income ratio is too high. She makes about $48k a year before taxes.
Right now shes paying $445 a month with two loans in forbearance until September at which point she estimates they will be about $850 a month. The sofi.com estimate for the 15 year fixed rate is $860 a month and all the loans would be paid off in 15 yeara which would be five years early for the ones in forbearance and 2.5 years early for the others plus the payment is only a little more.

Neither of us understand show this stuff works. We need help understanding the pros.and cons of doing this. Thank you.

Here are her loan amounts:

Balance Interest Rate Monthly Payment

$13,594.32 9.17% Variable $129.42

$17,995.20 4.92% Variable $126.00

$16,157.70 5.42 % Variable $117.58

$4,541.27 5.17% Variable $32.48

$25,266.61 6.80% Fixed

$20,963.30 5.42% Variable $38.75

$7,330.39 6.80% Fixed

Total student loan debt: $105,848.79 Total payment now: $444.23

All loans are on 20 year repayment as of now i think. Shes been paying the minimums on all but the two in forbearance for about 2.5 years.

To be honest we were hoping to find a lender willing to do a 20 year consolidation so we could lower the payment but if this is our only option should we do it or wait ubtil september or only do it to sone of the loans? We are so confused",finance,1393438481

So I'm looking to put 10k down on my vehicle in August '14. So right now I'm chucking money each month in my savings for that goal at the end of summer.


However I was curious about something, would it be wise to just max out my Roth IRA for this year with $5.5k and let it sit in there till I'm ready to buy my vehicle. It would accumulate earnings hopefully, at the very least do better than the low percentage interest rate on my Savings Account. Hell I'd be happy if it got 4% returns for 6 months. Come August I would pull it out (giggity) and from my understanding it would be penalty/tax free.


I realize this is a little risky, but I feel like the potential reward of earning a couple hundred bucks over the next 6 months rather than watch it sit in an SA, is worth the risk.

Just thought I would give you guys an update! We just closed on our home equity loan! We got approved for the full $17,000 with our monthly payments going to $305/mo which is more manageable than what we were dealing with before. Our interest rate is much lower than I had anticipated also at 5%, so our main focus will be paying off all the other higher interest rate stuff going forward. And we already have $1200 in savings from our tax return, now we just have to stick to it. We also managed to lower our utilities by $60 and we just got our cable bill and it's also down by $100. We are very optimistic going forward as we've both had a huge overhaul in our way of thinking. It's not going to be easy staying on this path, but we are both very determined to get through this debt free and I just finished cutting up our credit cards. I'm waiting for the payments to go through so I can close some of them. We are going to keep 2 open so our credit scores don't completely tank, but the rest are being closed, and the 2 left open are going into a safe deposit box so that they aren't easily accessible. 

Thank you guys again for all the help! It was a huge relief to get this out in the open and get started on this process and you guys definitely helped!",finance,1393442348

personalfinance,"Weird Financial Position via Public Service Loan Forgiveness, help?","So I do not know how many people are in my same boat, but I imagine their might be a few lawyer/MBA folks in this position.  I am a young adult (27) lawyer and I owe a lot in student loans, approx. 170K an am currently enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (I work for a state government).  For those who do not know PSLF in the USA, is a program whereby the government forgives the balance of a student loan debt after 10 years of qualifying loan payments, so long as you work at a non-profit or public institution.

I am currently on IBR plan and have been since late 2011 (so 2.5 years in).  I make approx 70K now (well 75K now, but 67K for part of last year and soon to be 85K  later this year) and to scoot in under the threshold and qualify for IBR I max out my 403(b) contribution, which makes it look like my income is actually in the high 40Ks to the federal government, according to last years tax returns at least (which is what the gov. uses to calculate IBR eligibility).

Thus, my 403(b)+Roth IRA thus has a lot of money it (well to me) approximately ~85K, after just 2.5 year (wow has the market been good!).  

1) Does anyone know, if you switch from IBR to regular loan payments, will that restart the eligibility period for PLSF (so would my payments under IBR not qualify and would it 'restart the clock on the 10 year timeline for PSLF)?  This seems to perversely incentive me not to take raises past the point it knocks me out of IBR.  If so does anyone know the threshold and which you stop qualifying for IBR?

2) Similarly if you do the math, going to a private sector job, I would have to net approximately 17K per year (more each subsequent year) to equal the 170K forgiveness that I would be destined to get in my public sector job.  Has anyone else, tried to balance this in terms of long term career prospects?  For instance, say I get fired/laid off at year 8, it would make tons of sense to go be a janitor at school for the next 2 years so I could get the balance of that 170K forgiven, then say some mid-level lawyer at a firm.

3) Does anyone else think this strategy is insane, trying to divert the max into your 403(b) to get in under IBR, just so you can leave the government with a big bill (the balance of my student loans) and not get crushed by monthly loan payments?  

I live frugally, but have no real emergency fund (but no credit card debt either), and cannot realistically divert money into saving for a house b/c I need to slash the income to get in under IBR.  On the plus side, its nice seeing my retirement nest egg grow.  

TLDR: I am enrolled in PSLF, my income is probably getting high enough to kick me out of IBR (unless I continue to max divert to my 403b), does that reset the PSLF clock?",finance,1393446024
personalfinance,Seeking some Guidance,"Hi everyone.  Using a throwaway.

I'm a 40 year old federal employee making $93k a year in the US.

I currently contribute 13% of my salary to TSP lifecycle funds and get the federal match of 5%.

I am on track for the FERS pension to pay 33% of my salary upon retirement at 62.
I have a previous pension that will net me about $4k a year starting at 59 1/2.

I started late in life and only have $63000 in TSP.
I have a $5k emergency fund that I am still actively putting a couple hundred dollars into monthly to build higher.
I have a small VA mortgage that I'm not concerned about.
I have a $12000 truck loan at 2.99% with 3yrs left.
I have a chase credit card with a 0% 12 month balance of 2000 (I took out a balance transfer to drop $2k on the personal loan.)
I only have one big debt, a 7 year $20000 personal loan at 8.99%
I have about $50k of unused credit between three credit cards with the highest interest rate being 10.99%
I have excellent credit (800+ fico)

I would like to slam the personal loan and pay it off much sooner saving thousands in interest. I'm already paying $500 more a month than the minimum payment via strict budgeting, but want to pay $1200.
I'm thinking about dropping my TSP contributions to 5% which would still give me the federal 5% match and applying everything I can on the personal loan while still feeding into my EF.

My concern is that I'll screw up any chances of retiring and or lead an elderly life of eating cat food if I do this.

Given that I have a decent salary, federal pension, secondary pension, does it seem wise to lower TSP contributions to pay off this debt, or should I just pay it out under the standard terms?  I'm heavily leaning towards paying it off as quickly as possible and if I was ten years younger it would be a no brainer... I would also kill off the $2000 credit card debt before the 0% is up and then resume my TSP contributions to the max.

Bitcoin,Manchin Demands Federal Regulators Ban Cash [Fixed],"Feb 26 2014
Manchin Demands Federal Regulators Ban Cash
Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) sent a letter to federal regulators seeking a ban on Cash, the currency that is regulated and unstable, and has been used in illicit activity, including drug trafficking and money laundering. Senator Manchin expressed concerns about the negative effect Cash could have on America’s economy if this currency remains regulated. The letter was sent to Secretary Lew, Chairwoman Yellen, Commissioner Curry, Acting Chairman Wetjen, Chairman Gruenberg, and Chairwoman White.

Please read the full text of Senator Manchin’s letter below.

Dear Secretary Lew, Chairwoman Yellen, Commissioner Curry, Acting Chairman Wetjen, Chairman Gruenberg, Chairwoman White:

I write today to express my concerns about Cash. This currency is currently regulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly unstable and disruptive to our economy. For the reasons outlined below, I urge regulators to take appropriate action to limit the abilities of this highly unstable currency.

By way of background, Cash is a currency that has gained notoriety in recent months due to its rising exchange value and relation to illegal transactions. Cash is not defined by a public address or a private key, thus Cash has no token of value or a also a method for transferring that value.  It also means that Cash does not provide a unique digital fingerprint, which allows for anonymous and irreversible transactions.

The very features that make Cash attractive to some also attract criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement. Due to Cash’s anonymity, the market has been extremely susceptible to hackers and scam artists stealing millions from Cash users. Anonymity combined with Cash’s inability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions. 

Cash has also become a haven for individuals to buy black market items. Individuals are able to anonymously purchase items such as drugs and weapons illegally. I have already written to regulators once on the now-closed Silkroad, which operated for years in supplying drugs and other black market items to criminals, thanks in large part to the creation of Cash.

That is why more than a handful of countries, and their banking systems, have cautioned against the use of Cash.  Indeed, it has been banned in two different countries—Thailand and China—and South Korea stated that it will not recognize Cash as a legitimate currency.  Several other countries, including the European Union, have issued warnings to Cash users as their respective governments consider options for regulating or banning its use entirely. While it is disappointing that the world leader and epicenter of the banking industry will only follow suit instead of making policy, it is high time that the United States heed our allies’ warnings. I am most concerned that as Cash is inevitably banned in other countries, Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency.

Our foreign counterparts have already understood the wide range of problems even with Cash’s legitimate uses - from its significant price fluctuations to its deflationary nature. Just last week, Cash prices plunged after the currency’s major exchange, Wall Street, experienced technical issues. Two days ago, this exchange took its website down and is no longer even accessible. This was not a unique event; news of plummeting or skyrocketing Cash prices is almost a weekly occurrence. In addition, its deflationary trends ensure that only speculators, such as so-called “Cash miners,” will benefit from possessing the virtual currency. There is no doubt average American consumers stand to lose by transacting in Cash. As of December 2013, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows 1.3% inflation, while a recent media report indicated Cash CPI has 98% deflation. In other words, spending Cash now will cost you many orders of wealth in the future. This flaw makes Cash’s value to the U.S. economy suspect, if not outright detrimental.

The clear ends of Cash for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me weary of its use.  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee issued a report just this month stating, “There is widespread concern about the Cash system’s possible impact on national currencies, its potential for criminal misuse, and the implications of its use for taxation.” Before the U.S. gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.

Sincerely,
U.S. Joe Manchin III

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or invest?,"I am looking for advice on the most beneficial way to focus my resources. 

My situation: my wife and I are 30 years old, making ~180k gross combined annually (165k base pay and ~15k bonus). We are maxing out our 401ks (17,500 +6% employer match) and IRAs (Vanguard). We currently have the following debts:

Student loan 2: $24,000 @ 6.8%

Student loan 3: $21,500 @ 5.63%

investing,X-Post from /Crazyideas: A credit union (not for profit) for the betterment of the community and world.,"First let me say that I am trying to find a way to create and enable individuals and members of a society to grow themselves out of poverty while obtaining new opportunities to education, housing, employment and social status.

Premise of the idea:
A credit union that uses the money invested to give loans to communities and individuals to grow socially and economically, and then taking all profits when loans are repayed and upping interest rates and giving bonuses (dividends) to members. The idea is similar to micro financing but with a ton of individuals with a common goal, to gain wealth (interest) while benefiting others through loans.

Breakdown of the idea:
-You start a credit union, which itself is a not for profit organization. You first start a web and media campaign finding members in one specific area geographically and get people to sign on in support with a ""yes"" vote, as well as agree to join the credit union when it starts.

-Get somewhere between 3000 and 5000 members for this.
-Ask for a one time start up fee of $25 to join

Loan money to members and groups and start programs such as microfinancing in other countries to allow loans to be made.

-When loans are repayed, what looks like bonuses or dividends are paid to the members / and or interests rates on savings and checking accounts grow.
repeat.

The future:
-There would be a branch of said credit union in all major cities, one brick and mortar location and atms to withdrawn and deposit.

Reasons why this is a good idea:
- Helps communities grow
- Helps finance individuals creative ideas and microfinance individuals to start to build a credit history
- Does not put money into big banks or the guy on tops pocket, rather benefits all members and people in communities being developed.
- BIG ONE: offers better interest rates and loan options than a typical bank


Perhaps you get a letter with your quarterly statement saying what you have done that is good for someone, you could read it and smile huge or tear it up just like you would a typical bank. If you dont participate in the details of the loans and community development behind the money it is just a regular bank with better interest and loan rates than the average bank.

Merchant Interest

Our merchant conferences and marketing efforts have resulted in an overwhelming amount of interest from businesses wanting to accept bitcoins. The variety of these businesses is excellent, and a future where Cypriots will be in a position to use Euros only to pay government institutions is within sight.

Many of these businesses want to pass on some of the savings from using Bee payment services to their customers. Some businesses do not want to convert their bitcoins into Euros at the point of sale, this will help us to target those businesses who do not service end users. These are positive steps toward a closed-loop Bitcoin economy.

SoEasy Stores are kiosks (mini markets, convenience stores). They are the largest chain on the island with 40 stores and they will enable Neo wallet holders to buy bitcoins and sell them via a Bee terminal at every SoEasy location. This agreement essentially means that we now have 40 additional locations across the island where people can access our services and Bitcoin.



International Coverage

Many international media outlets have contacted us for interviews surrounding what we are doing here in Cyprus with Bitcoin and we are going to be featured in many upcoming publications.



International Expansions

There is significant interest from individuals and groups to expand the Neo and Bee brand internationally, as well as interest from others who wish to emulate what Neo has started. We are willing to help anyone who wants to build professional services in the Bitcoin space, including those that wish to emulate what we are doing here. More professional businesses aimed at the masses will only serve as good thing for Bitcoin.



Multi-Signature Wallet Implementation

We have had a delay on the integration of the multi-signature wallets. This will be resolved soon with further development. All of our customers will be briefed on this delay. We are satisfied with our level of network security and continued monitoring of this infrastructure and we should have this service available soon.



MtGox Statement

What we are witnessing now with MtGox is further cleansing of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The odds are that MtGox is beyond repair in every aspect. Whether the coins are missing or not remains to be seen, as little solid information has been released. Luckily the Bitcoin space is now witnessing serious investors and business people developing infrastructure to utilize the technology in a more professional capacity. The time of garage companies, shady operators and teenage hackers has passed. The time of seriously funded, professionally operated, responsibly executed, carefully planned and diligently tested businesses is here. This new crop of businesses is more transparent, more secure and more professional than those of the first generation. Here at Neo and Bee and Neo EasyCoin, we are making great progress towards higher levels of transparency and professionalism. The willingness of other businesses such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, Coinkite, Circle and Blockchain.info to provide transparency
  and accountability is encouraging.

Our customers can always independently verify their Bitcoin holdings on the blockchain. We voluntarily subject ourselves to external audit with one of the Big Four audit firms, and we make painstaking efforts to remain on the forefront of physical and software security to ensure we do not become the next MtGox.

Attendees were amazed with the quality of the space and appreciated how much more educated they became after learning more about Bitcoin from our team. We opened many customer accounts, however, due to the MtGox situation, we withheld the sale of bitcoins temporarily to avoid immediate “loss” for customers that day and to keep focus on Neo and the benefits of Bitcoin.

This decision is not something that will be repeated in the future, it was a decision taken because we had not commenced operations at the time of the uncertainty surrounding MtGox.

Here are some photos from the event:

**Merchant Interest**

Our merchant conferences and marketing efforts have resulted in an overwhelming amount of interest from businesses wanting to accept bitcoins. The variety of these businesses is excellent, and a future where Cypriots will be in a position to use Euros only to pay government institutions is within sight.

Many of these businesses want to pass on some of the savings from using Bee payment services to their customers. Some businesses do not want to convert their bitcoins into Euros at the point of sale, this will help us to target those businesses who do not service end users. These are positive steps toward a closed-loop Bitcoin economy.

SoEasy Stores are kiosks (mini markets, convenience stores). They are the largest chain on the island with 40 stores and they will enable Neo wallet holders to buy bitcoins and sell them via a Bee terminal at every SoEasy location. This agreement essentially means that we now have 40 additional locations across the island where people can access our services and Bitcoin.



**International Coverage**

Many international media outlets have contacted us for interviews surrounding what we are doing here in Cyprus with Bitcoin and we are going to be featured in many upcoming publications.


**International Expansions**

There is significant interest from individuals and groups to expand the Neo and Bee brand internationally, as well as interest from others who wish to emulate what Neo has started. We are willing to help anyone who wants to build professional services in the Bitcoin space, including those that wish to emulate what we are doing here. More professional businesses aimed at the masses will only serve as good thing for Bitcoin.


**Multi-Signature Wallet Implementation**

We have had a delay on the integration of the multi-signature wallets. This will be resolved soon with further development. All of our customers will be briefed on this delay. We are satisfied with our level of network security and continued monitoring of this infrastructure and we should have this service available soon.



**MtGox Statement**

What we are witnessing now with MtGox is further cleansing of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The odds are that MtGox is beyond repair in every aspect. Whether the coins are missing or not remains to be seen, as little solid information has been released. Luckily the Bitcoin space is now witnessing serious investors and business people developing infrastructure to utilize the technology in a more professional capacity. The time of garage companies, shady operators and teenage hackers has passed. The time of seriously funded, professionally operated, responsibly executed, carefully planned and diligently tested businesses is here. This new crop of businesses is more transparent, more secure and more professional than those of the first generation. Here at Neo and Bee and Neo EasyCoin, we are making great progress towards higher levels of transparency and professionalism. The willingness of other businesses such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, Coinkite, Circle and Blockchain.info to provide transparency and accountability is encouraging.

Our customers can always independently verify their Bitcoin holdings on the blockchain. We voluntarily subject ourselves to external audit with one of the Big Four audit firms, and we make painstaking efforts to remain on the forefront of physical and software security to ensure we do not become the next MtGox.

Bitcoin is here to stay and it will only become stronger through more professional infrastructure.



Thank you!

The response from the BitcoinTalk forum, Reddit and Twitter has been amazing. Everyone here fully understands this is just the beginning for us, but we are excited by the future. Your continued support is extremely appreciated and we are all working towards making this a long-lasting business that is beneficial to everyone involved.""

If I succeed in writing an effective article, I could be selected for an internship at my local Fed bank.  My ideas so far to talk about in the article are the rising internet based peer to peer networks, and their effects on inflation/interest rates.  

I am also hoping to talk about the possible existence of a more socialist state of affairs in America, pertaining to a rise in artificial intelligence and a fall in unskilled labor jobs because of this - the socialist part coming in with some kind of flat rate income welfare for all Americans - and its affect on the Federal Reserve, interest and inflation rates.  This is the point of the paper I am having trouble with, because I really do not know the effects and need to research it a bit more.  

I am also planning to discuss the state of the Fed regarding the removal of the gold standard as well as its roll in fiat currency.

personalfinance,Chase CC just does not give a F*CK,"This is a rant.  Don't care who reads it just wanted to complain to someone.

So I opened my Chase Freedom card in 2008 while I was a poor college student.  The only jobs I had were crappy retail positions at Radio Shack and Best Buy.  Obviously the interest rate was a nice 29.99%.  I used the card somewhat frequently and would always pay it off in full at the end of each month.  This was, until law school, when I used the card more frequently and only made minimum payments.  

Despite the spending, I never missed, nor was I ever late on, a single monthly payment from 2008 to present.  

Fast forward to 2013, I graduated in May and found a job in October of last year.  The first thing I wanted to do when I got this job was to eliminate all outstanding credit card debt that I have in my three accounts - Chase, CapOne, and Sears.  

Since November, I've been making fairly significant payments per month and reduced my total CC debt from ~$5600 to ~$3800. Today I finally received back my tax returns which was about $1900 so I thought now is the time to call Chase, CapOne and Sears to lower my interest rate from the abhorrent 29.99% I had opened these cards with.  First on my list was Chase because I liked them the most out of the three companies (always very friendly on the phones, good customer service, lots of options available in online account management, etc.).  I did some research, found my credit report at all three bureaus was excellent - I only looked at the FICO score at Experian but saw that it was in the ""Excellent"" range (but just barely - 724).  Also found out Chase was offering new customers an interest rate of 13.99, 18.99, or 22.99 - so I wanted to shoot for 13.99 of course.

So I call Chase, explain I've been a loyal cardholder since 2008 when I was a broke college student and never missed or was late on a payment.  I ask ""I would like to speak with someone regarding lowering my interest rate.""  The guy on the other end says to hang on a second while he looks into something.  Comes back about 30 seconds later ""Unfortunately 29.99 is the best we can do.""  OK, I was expecting this.  I went through three years of law school so I kind of know something about negotiating.  So I respond with my own strong arm tactic ""Alright then I would like to go ahead and cancel my card.""  There was a slight pause before the Chase employee said ""OK may I place you on hold for one second?""  ""Sure,"" I say.  Thinking this would immediately get their attention and want to negotiate some, I was about to mark this up in the ""win"" column when, to my surprise, the rep came back on the phone with ""OK, Mr. HokieHusker, I will be happy to assist you in closing out your account today."" And then he liquidated all my rewards and closed the account.  

I was shocked to say the least.  I've had Chase since 2008 when I was a broke college student, never missed a payment, never late for a payment; now I have a good credit, making large payments for months, and they don't even try to negotiate - not even try to offer a 22.99% rate - to keep a loyal cardholder.  So I'd like to raise a glass to Chase - may your business practices quickly bring about your bankruptcy.  

tl; dr - Chase doesn't give a fuck about its customers.

edit - On a positive note, I paid off the outstanding balance of $1530 after it was closed.  So at least I have $1530 less CC debt now.",finance,1393459254
Bitcoin,Petition Senator Manchin: Don't Ban Bitcoin!,"https://www.change.org/petitions/manchin-joe-don-t-let-the-government-ban-bitcoin

Senator, 



As you are undoubtedly aware, lawmakers and federal regulators demonstrated great foresight during the 1990s and early 2000s by taking a ""wait and see"" approach to the Internet, rather than strangling it in the cradle. The Internet is used for all sorts of sordid activity, but its usefulness dramatically outweighs its harm. 



We are on the cusp of another such revolution: this time a revolution in money. You are correct that bitcoins are used in many sordid and criminal activities. However, the #1 most widely used form of money used by criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists is still the U.S. Dollar. Should we ban that, too? So far, the only countries to have banned bitcoin are those with a history of autocratic rule--Russia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, and China. Do we really want to join that group? 



I urge you to take a wise approach to this newly emerging technology. I urge you to push for smart regulations to protect U.S. consumers and strangle criminals and money launderers--but not to throw the baby out with the bath water. 

What advantages does bitcoin offer? 

a) Free and seamless payment network. Eliminate billions of dollars in fees charged by banks and payment processors. Allow poor immigrant workers to send money overseas without paying exorbitant fees. 

b) Creates a payment system outside the control of ""too big to fail"" banks. Allows consumers a choice. 

c) Security and privacy. Credit card numbers and personal information are not stored and transmitted multiple times over vulnerable networks. Bitcoins are cryptographically secure and cannot be forged.

Here is an excerpt of the theory proposed by Kracken CEO, Jesse Powell, on the fallout of Mt. Gox:

""I've been wracking my brain trying to make sense of everything.  What gets me is that Mark isn't an idiot.  If I assume that the Crisis Strategy Draft is truthy, a scenario like this is more plausible than what we've been fed:

**1.** Gox was robbed of a massive amount of coins (800k+) at some prior point in time, possibly June 2011, and has been operating a fractional reserve since.

**2.** Gox determined that **it was better to continue operating the exchange, probably both for the sake of Bitcoin,** and for their customers who would eventually be made whole from fees earned.

**3.** Gox knew of transaction malleability and had been keeping that scapegoat in their back pocket to use in the event of a bank run.  Or, they didn't know but the losses from TM were actually recent and minor.  Or, they didn't know but the losses from TM occurred over a long period of time and they never noticed because they never reconciled the books, because they knew they wouldn't match anyway because they were already fractional.

**4.** Fiat withdrawal problems led to an increased uptick of BTC withdrawals, outpacing BTC deposits and draining reserves to 0.  This may have been compounded by an actual problem with transaction malleability that accelerated the process.

**5.** Gox spent its fiat reserves and customers' fiat reserves to buy up BTC in order to keep the ship afloat until they could launch their rebranded Gox.com and Bitpocket wallet, which they'd hoped would provide more runway in the form of additional BTC deposits.

**6.** Gox doesn't make it happen in time and is forced to shut down, negative on fiat by millions and having lost all BTC.""

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Foundation snitched on Mt.Gox to the Feds,"http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Bitcoin-Foundation-Said-to-Ask-Prosecutors-for-5271082.php

**Feb. 26 (Bloomberg)** -- The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the nascent digital currency, provided information to federal prosecutors this week that helped spur a probe into Mt. Gox, a shuttered exchange in Tokyo.

*“The Bitcoin Foundation proactively reached out to the Southern District of New York to offer assistance,”* the foundation said in an e-mailed statement. “We are continuing to help them and we are cooperating fully with their investigation.”

Shortly after Mt. Gox’s chief executive officer, Mark Karpeles, resigned from the foundation’s board on Feb. 24, the organization provided the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office with documents described as detailing the theft of as much as $400 million from the exchange, according to two people familiar with the effort. The people requested anonymity because the communications were private.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, two other people familiar with the matter said. Bharara requested that Mt. Gox preserve documents as part of the probe, one of the people said.

Bharara’s office also requested information from the foundation as well as companies that have done business with Mt. Gox, said one of the people briefed on the foundation’s contacts with prosecutors. The foundation and the companies are not targets of the investigation, the person said.


**Increased Attention**


The shuttering of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest exchange for digital-currency transactions, comes after months in which Bitcoin’s price soared, attracting increased attention from investors and customers, even as regulators and lawmakers raised concern that the currency could be used for money- laundering and fraud. Japanese authorities said earlier they are probing the exchange’s shutdown as well.

As reports surfaced suggesting the exchange was in trouble, other Bitcoin companies as well as the foundation worked to distance themselves from Mt. Gox.

“As our industry matures, we are seeing a second wave of capable, responsible entrepreneurs and investors who are building reliable services for this ecosystem,” the foundation said yesterday in a statement.

Mt. Gox, which had the largest market share of all digital currency exchanges as recently as April 2013, went offline yesterday after halting customers’ Bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7. A document posted on the Internet labeled “Crisis Strategy Draft” said Mt. Gox had lost 744,408 Bitcoins, about $400 million at current rates, as a result of theft that “went unnoticed for several years.”


**Document Provided**


The Bitcoin Foundation provided that document to Bharara’s office soon after obtaining it, one of the people said.

A statement posted today on the Mt. Gox website attributed to Karpeles said he is “still in Japan” working to resolve the exchange’s problems. The exchange’s staff has been instructed “not to give any response or information,” the statement said.

Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital currency, based on a peer-to-peer software protocol, has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving user anonymity.


**Previous Probes**


Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for Bharara, said the office would neither confirm or deny the existence of a federal investigation. Bharara’s office has previously filed charges against Silk Road, an online drug bazaar that accepted Bitcoin, and BitInstant, a New York-based exchange.

This isn’t the first time Mt. Gox has drawn the attention of U.S. authorities. The Department of Homeland Security seized two bank accounts belonging to Mt. Gox worth a total of $5 million last year because the exchange wasn’t registered with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

The foundation and Mt. Gox clashed on Feb. 10, before the exchange went offline, when Mt. Gox blamed its troubles on the underlying software for Bitcoin. The foundation, which helps steward the open-source Bitcoin software, responded that the exchange’s customized implementation of it, not the software itself, was to blame.",cryptocurrency,1393473919

Bitcoin,Bitcoin: The future of regulations,"**Disclosures:**  
I am a CPA. I have bought bitcoins from coinbase and sold them for a profit. I have attempted to learn about bitcoin (or as much as I can given my lack of tech savyness). Furthermore at times I have been a vitriolic opponent of bitcoin and a few of the bitcoinites who frequent this sub. If you have been on the receiving of one of my rants I apologize. With that said I'm still skeptical about bitcoin. I am not here to bash on bitcoin but to honestly ask questions and seek honest feedback. 

Furthermore I am NOT happy about the current gox affair, I don't think anyone should lose money because of fraud, manipulation, hacking, theft, whatever the ultimate issue is. I am truly sorry to those affected, and I hope you are able to recover your investment, and anything I can do to help in the recovery I will.

**Who do you want to regulate bitcoin/exchanges?** 

Lets face the obvious first, regulations will happen its only a matter of time and the more fraud, soured investors, lawsuits will only speed up this process. Now its true that the currency itself can't be regulated (IE banning it would be silly and impractical) but the exchanges can and should be regulated. So what's the best way to insure regulations give reasonable protections and still allow you the freedom you're seeking? Well it's easy, you write the regulations. This is possible the NYSE is a prime example of this. Accounting pre Enron was another example of self regulations. Generally speaking if you are willing to put forth your own regulations and place some organization in charge of enforcing those regulations, you tend to get rules that are favorable to you while still offering protection. So the first question: Is it possible for us to establish some type of organization that will set standards for exchange practices? This organization would be required to draft up rules governing how an exchange should work, in an open and transparent process, as well as policing existing exchanges? It could even act as a facilitator or a mediator in the case of exchange problems. Granted this organization wouldn't have the power to enforce laws or regulations, but neither does the NYSE, however the NYSE is very clear, follow our rules or we will not do business with you, and because of its size most companies toe the line and follow the rules. The NYSE when it finds violations will also refer its finding over to the SEC for potential prosecution. So really by just adopting the NYSE rules and modifying them to bitcoin we could build effective regulations ourselves. Think of it like this, when your parents asked you ""What should your punishment be?"" did you get a better or worse punishment then if they simply decided for you?  Maybe we create an org called the BitcoinEX, and give a seal of approval to exchanges that meet a set guidelines. Is anyone not comfortable with something like this? Right now bitcoin's problem stem from a few places: the exchanges which run the roost without a single modicum of transparency, different rules for different exchanges, different policies, etc... and then you have federal legislators, if they feel ""this new fangled money thing is a scam"" then you can bet they are going to be against you. Wouldn't a single governing body, that is exercising oversight be a much more powerful voice then the disjointed masses writing nasty letters to senators? 

So far I don't think I've proposed anything to over the top. 

Now its not an easy thing to build something like this, it wouldn't happen over night and it would take a considerable amount of effort from computer wiz kids, accountants, lawyers, the exchanges themselves, the general public etc... but this would certainly keep the government off your backs, and might be the one thing that allows bitcoin to succeed in the long run. Now some people may not like an idea like this, some people may balk at the very idea of any attempt at regulation, and if the vast majority of bitcoiners feel this way, then unfortunately bitcoins will be doomed to failure, and not because the protocol is ""bad"" but because investor confidence will be non-existent. I'm reminded of an old military saying ""It takes ten atta boy, to erase one awww shit"" Mt gox, is a giant AWWW SHIT! If anyone was even remotely interested in bitcoin its quite possible that this event alone has turned them away, and if we don't learn from these mistakes then they will happen over and over again. I look forward to some input and some different ideas, even if it's only a pleasant go fuck yourself.

TBI Exclusive - The Final Goxing
Friends:
Earlier this week, I leaked a document I received from a reliable source entitled ""Crisis Strategy Draft"", which was purportedly a roadmap to show how Mt. Gox could recover from insolvency despite the mind-blowing loss of nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins.

Since that initial leak, I have had a number of conversations with industry insiders who have spoken about the situation both on and off the record. They have confirmed the best news possible for Bitcoin given the damning evidence documented in the leaked presentation: Mt. Gox acted alone in its deceit, and ultimately failed in its desperation, to find an investor willing to bail them out.

Although Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles would only admit that the leaked document was ""more or less authentic"" I have confirmed that it is, in fact, a document prepared by Mt. Gox representatives retained from global consulting firm Mandalah. The creator of Mt. Gox's 27 page business plan (also released earlier tonight) was revealed to be Samir Bennafla, a French expat and employee of Mandalah. A source who met with the Mt. Gox team the day after the ""Crisis Strategy Draft"" was created, confirmed that Bennefla and another person joined Mark Karpeles for a meeting to discuss an emergency bailout of Mt. Gox.

This meeting triggered a chain reaction of events in which the solicited investors rebuffed Karpeles and his colleagues, demanded they come clean to customers and stakeholders immediately, and then notified other industry executives, including those at the Bitcoin Foundation, of the catastrophic losses at Mt. Gox.  This group of executives promptly reached out to regulatory authorities and began crafting a joint statement condemning Mt. Gox.

Sources also tell me that multiple investors who were approached restricted their own employees from buying or selling bitcoin themselves as soon as they learned the extent of the damage at Mt. Gox.

Mt. Gox has allegedly never conducted a single audit of its customer deposits, and it is believed that Karpeles may have been the only one within the company to have knowledge of how to actually tap the exchange's cold storage. It remains unclear exactly how this type of storage leak could have happened over a multi-year period without any knowledge on the part of the executives at Mt. Gox.

As a result of Karpeles' apparent ""Wizard of Oz"" status within the organization, it also appears unlikely that the true technical cause of the leak will be fully understood until the embattled CEO speaks.  Whether that will happen during an interview or a possible criminal case in unclear.

The latter seems likely, however, as one source believes that Karpeles knew about the pervasive damage of the transaction malleability attacks for several weeks and was engaging in an arbitrage scheme that leveraged the depressed Mt. Gox price to reap gains on other exchanges. This was allegedly happening well before the exchange's breaking point this past weekend.

Mark Karpeles was unreachable for comment, despite repeated attempts, as were representatives from Mandalah Consulting.

However, three major industry players that were initially tied to Mt. Gox ""acquisition"" rumors have either released statements or confirmations (via backchannels) unequivocally denying any improper ties to Mt. Gox.

The Bitcoin Foundation, Blockchain.info and SecondMarket have by all accounts acted ethically and professionally in the face of a serious scandal. Their speedy clarifications and apparent cooperation with authorities is commendable and suggests that Mt. Gox was merely bad apple in an otherwise good bunch.  

Mt. Gox lived among the Bitcoin community for several years as an early pioneer.  Luckily for the industry, it appears to have died alone.

Saving: 

When starting to save, it would help to think about sending your money towards two goals: Short Term Needs and Long Term Needs 

Short Term Needs: Saving for “Short Term Needs” is saving money to be used within the next year or for emergency fund purposes at any time. Since you do not have a long time to weather volatility in a risky investment, short term money should be saved in something safe and secure. This typically means a bank savings account or money market (to invest a more efficiently, take time to learn about Short Term Bond Mutual Funds). Once you have your credit card debt under control and are building good credit, you can afford to send money towards savings instead of paying off this high interest rate debt. You should continue making the minimum loan payments on student loan debt and other low interest rate debt. A person’s first major financial goal in life as an independent should be to establish an Emergency Fund. If you are the type of person that likes to set goals or make a list to check off , consider this step 2 after understanding your credit score. An Emergency Fund is a reserve of cash holdings set in place strictly for unexpected expenses and to prevent you from missing payments if your monthly incoming cash flow stops for one reason or the other. A credit card is NOT an emergency fund. If you have a credit card account and are starting to save, you should have your credit card completely paid off and then build the emergency fund account in addition to having your cards paid off. Interest earnings on funds in a safe account like a bank savings account or money market, today, will pay under 1% annual interest. 

Compare this to the 30% annual interest that your credit card debt accrues at and you see why you should focus on the credit card debt first before saving. The general rule of thumb to follow and what most financial planning textbooks will tell you to accumulate is anywhere from 3-6 months worth of living expenses. I generally recommend having at least enough cash to pay full bills (rent, electricity, food) for 3 months. The thinking here is that if you lose your job or have to take a leave of absence from work, you should be able to get back on the horse or find some other type of income-generating activity within 3 months. The best type of vehicle to save an emergency fund in used to be a regular bank savings account. You could typically find one paying decent interest with low annual costs, if any. 

These days, in the low interest rate environment we are in, I typically recommend what is called a No-Load Short Term Bond Mutual Fund. This is an account that you can find at financial institutions with mutual fund families that generally requires a small starting investment and offers liquidity if you need to access the funds. Some Short Term Bond Mutual Funds also offer limited checkwriting ability for accessing the funds immediately. Obviously if this is your emergency fund you want to limit the number of times you access this money, but in an emergency, you may need to access cash right away so the liquidity feature is quite attractive. Being that this is a completely unbiased and objective take on saving, I will not recommend any particular mutual fund family, but know that some are better than others. If you want to get started, I would recommend Googling “Short Term Bond Funds” and calling 3 institutions to learn about their options for you. I would ask what the minimum starting investment is, what are the ways you can access the funds, and also work to set up a monthly allotment into the account. 

Some Short Term Bond Funds allow you to start with as little as $20 per month without any initial deposit required. These mutual funds typically pay monthly interest on the last weekday of every month. Interest rates on these types of funds are generally 1-2% higher than bank savings accounts or money market accounts (another type of cash account). 

This may not sound like much, but over time, it can make a significant difference. The best way to save monthly is to establish a monthly allotment that is drafted from a checking account the day after payday. If you get a $1000 paycheck deposited in your checking account on the 1st, set up an allotment drawing $130 or so out on the 2nd. If you have more money available to you, you will spend more money. However, if you get into the habit of saving right off the bat, you will not know what it is like to have those extra funds and will not feel the loss of that savings monthly. If you are reading this before you have your first real job, you would do yourself a huge favor to set up a monthly savings amount to be drafted the day after getting your first paycheck. 

Long Term Needs: Long Term Savings is money that you do not anticipate needing to touch for either several years or even retirement. The federal government provides tax advantages when you earmark funds for retirement. You can typically access these funds penalty free when you reach the age of 59 and a half years old. The primary long term vehicle used by most investors today is either a 401(k) or Roth IRA. To understand how these are advantageous to you, it helps to understand how taxation on investments like mutual funds or stocks work. 

To understand this, you should also have a general idea how taxation at the individual level works too: Taxes For financial planning purposes, there are two primary tax concepts you need to be somewhat familiar with. Once is tax on income earned (Federal Income Tax), the other is tax from selling something for a gain (Capital Gains Tax). To understand how long term investing, 401(k)’s, and IRAs benefit you, a general understanding of some high level tax concepts should be reviewed. Income Tax “I had a friend finish up grad school and land an entry-level job with an insurance company. His starting base salary was $40,000. This equates to $3,333 per month in gross (before tax) salary. For his first job, he knew nothing of taxes other than to pay as little as possible. Therefore he elected to not withhold taxes on his paycheck as he would pay them at the end of the year. This was a huge mistake. No matter what you elect to withhold each paycheck for taxes, you will pay the same amount at the end of the year. The US Federal Income Tax System works in a progressive manner. 

The more money you make, the higher the percentage of tax is taken out on your higher earnings. Here is the 2012 tax bracket: Tax Bracket Married Filing Jointly Single Progressive Taxes paid for Married FilingJointly 10% Bracket $0 – $17,400 $0 – $8,700 $17,400 of income earned at 10%= $1,740 Tax Owed 15% Bracket $17,400 – $70,700 $8,700 – $35,350 $1,740 +[15%($70,700-$17,400)]= $9,735 Tax Owed if MFJ and earned income is $70,700 25% Bracket $70,700 – $142,700 $35,350 – $85,650 $9,735 +[25%($142,700-$70,700)]= $27,735 Tax Owed if MFJ and earned income is $142,700 28% Bracket $142,700 – $217,450 $85,650 – $178,650 $27,735 +[28%($217,450-$142,700)]= $48,665 Tax Owed if MFJ and earned income is $217,450 33% Bracket $217,450 – $388,350 $178,650 – $388,350 $48,665 +[33%($217,450-$142,700)]= $73,333 Tax Owed if MFJ and earned income is $388,350 35% Bracket Over $388,350 Over $388,350 $73,333 +[35%(Your income- $388,350) A common misconception many people have is that if you make $100,000, you fall into the 25% tax bracket and thus have to pay $25,000 for income tax. Taxation on income does not work this way. If you earn $100,000 Married Filing Jointly, you pay $9,735+ [25% ($100,000-$70,700)= $17,060 in tax. Once again, Married Filing Jointly, while they fall in the 25% tax bracket, will only really pay $17,060 (17%) in taxes. We call this 17% the effective tax rate. Notice that it does not matter when or how you pay the taxes. 

You will still owe the same amount no matter what you have drafted from your monthly paycheck. Some people like to take more out per month than what they actually need so that they receive a larger tax refund at the end of the year. Another view point is to try and get as close to your real rate as possible to avoid any surprises. I prefer to try and get as close to the real rate as possible, and then add an additional 5% as a safety net. In order to determine a ballpark amount that you should withhold, please visit the IRS Withholding Calculator at http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96196,00.html. It can take a few years to get this income tax concept down, but the earlier you learn it, the better. Capital Gains Tax There are many applications of the Capital Gains Tax and many different scenarios that can play out depending on the type of asset you sell and the length of time you held it for. The bottom line is that if you invest in a stock or mutual fund, and you sell it for a gain, you have to pay tax on that gain. 

This is basic math here. You buy a stock at $10 and sell it for $30, you have $20 of capital gains that are subject to tax. Within Capital Gains Tax, you have Long Term Capital Gains and Short Term Capital Gains. Long Term Capital Gains= Long term capital gains tax is applicable when you have held the investment for at least 12 months before selling. Today, the Long Term Capital Gains tax rate is fixed at 15%. So if you bought one share of Microsoft Stock 14 months ago for $50 and today you sell it for $80, you will pay tax on $30 of long term capital gains. 15% of $30 is $4.50. To recap, you bought it at $50, sold it for $80 and netted a $25.50 profit after-tax. Short Term Capital Gains= Short term capital gains tax is applicable when you have held the investment for less than 12 months. Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. If you are in the 15% tax bracket, you will pay 15% on the gains and if you are in the 35% tax bracket you will pay 35% on the gains. The same Microsoft share that was bought for $50 and sold for $80 will be subject to 35% taxes (for an individual in the highest tax bracket). 35% on $30 is $10.50. This results in a $19.50 profit after-taxes. The difference between holding a position less than or over 12 months can be significant (especially at the higher tax brackets). This tax structure also makes day trading and short term trading less profitable. If you elect to invest in stocks or mutual funds, remember to consider the tax impact of selling today, or waiting past the 12 month period.

Impact of taxes on $50,000 annual salary: Let’s say you are fortunate enough to land a job paying you $50,000. This is $4,166 gross pay per month before taxes are taken out. A $50k income job will also typically come with a 401(k) investment option and group health insurance along with other benefits. 

Conservatively speaking, we will assume your employer offers a 3% match on 401(k) contributions (covered later) and that health insurance runs $2,500 per year. Here is how it may play out: $50,000 Gross Annual Salary -$2,500 Health Insurance -$1,500 401(k) Savings $46,000 Pre-tax income $46,000 becomes your taxable annual income. Taxes on this amount are $1,740+[15%($46,000-$17,400)]= $6,030 Your $50,000 gross annual salary translates to approximately $39,970 that goes into your pocket. Monthly that totals $3,330 or a paycheck that deposits $1,665 into your personal checking account twice a month. Without considering taxes or health insurance, many people overestimate their monthly incoming cash flow. Without considering these expenses, one would assume a $50,000 salary nets $2,083 twice per month. An overestimation of $418 every two weeks or $836 per month! This tax effect increases as you make more money and are taxed at a higher rate. Let’s look at the same calculation on a $200,000 annual salary. 

Before taxes, $200k annually is $16,667. This $200k income job will also come with a 401(k) investment option and group health insurance along with other benefits. Conservatively speaking, we will assume the employer offers a 3% match on 401(k) contributions (covered later) and that health insurance runs $2,500 per year. Here is how it may play out: $200,000 Gross Annual Salary -$2,500 Health Insurance -$6,000 401(k) Savings (3%) $191,500 Pre-tax income $191,500 becomes your taxable annual income. Taxes on this amount are $27,735+[28%($191,500-$142,700)]= $41,399. The $200,000 gross annual salary to translates to approximately $150,101 that goes into your pocket annually. Monthly that totals $12,508 or a paycheck that deposits $6,254 into your personal checking account twice a month. Without considering taxes or health insurance, many people overestimate their monthly incoming cash flow. Without considering these expenses, one would assume a $200,000 salary nets $8,333 twice per month. An overestimation of $2,079 every two weeks or $4,158 per month! These two examples illustrate the importance of the consideration of taxes and benefits when calculating how much to spend on rent, automobiles, or monthly spending. After 3 years of full time employment, your understanding of income tax and net pay will greatly increase, but if you are not prepared for it, it can be a rude awakening.

The Roth IRA:

The Roth IRA is one of the most popular long term savings accounts for younger investors. If you have a basic understanding of income and capital gains tax, you can see how a Roth IRA would benefit you. First, a Roth IRA takes “After-tax” dollars. “After-tax” means that you have already paid income tax on this money before you make the contribution. If you have a job now, the money that is sitting in your checking account right now is “after-tax” money. Your gross salary is considered to be “pre-tax” money. 

In the preceding tax example, we showed a gross salary of $50,000. If this is your salary, you have the ability to either make “pre-tax” contributions to a 401(k)/Traditional IRA or you have the ability to make “after-tax” contributions to a Roth IRA. “Pre-tax” contributions are contributions sent into an investment account before taxes have been paid on the funds. Generally speaking, you should be generating a high level of income for pre-tax contributions to benefit you. For that reason, 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are typically utilized by older investors or people in higher income tax brackets. The bottom line is that the larger the difference between your tax bracket when you make the 401(k) contributions and the time you withdraw the funds and pay tax on them, the larger the benefit.

For example, if you make a gross salary of $50,000 and contribute $10,000 over the year into your 401(k), your taxable income for the year will be reduced by $10,000 and then you will pay income tax on the remainder. Below is similar to what the top of your paycheck may look like. $50,000 Gross Salary $10,000- sent “Pre-tax” to your 401(k) -------------------- 401(k) now holds $10,000 $40,000 is your taxable income. -$5,130 (taxes due on $40k of income) $34,870 Cash in your pocket after saving in your 401(k) and paying tax on the income you receive today. Now let’s look at the same employee only assume they DO NOT make the 401(k) contribution throughout the year. $50,000 Gross Salary 401(k) now holds $0 $50,000 is your taxable income. -$6,630 (taxes due on $40k of income) $43,370 Cash in your pocket after NOT saving in your 401(k). So in the first example, you are left with $34,870 in your pocket plus a 401(k) account with a $10,000 balance. In the second example, you are only left with $43,370 in your pocket and no savings. 

The 401(k) contribution reduces your taxable income by providing you with a deduction for the contributions. Taking a deduction for a contribution to any retirement account means you are making “pre-tax” contributions to that account. In other words, the federal government has not taken their share of taxes from money in a 401(k) or Traditional IRA. The term is “pre-tax” contributions. Implying that you are making these contributions before paying tax on the funds. You cannot escape paying income tax on this money, you are just delaying the payment of tax until a later date. In 2012, the federal government says that you have to keep money in a 401(k) or Traditional IRA until you are 59½ before you can take penalty-free withdrawals. When you reach age 59½, you may begin taking distributions from your retirement account. It is at this time that you pay tax on the money in the account. The thought process behind the 401(k) and Traditional IRA is that you will likely be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than what you are at when you saved the money. In retirement you will likely be earning less income than when you made the savings and will ultimately pay less tax as a result. Of course, if Congress changes our income tax rates and increases them across the board, this benefit could be reduced. Think of a 401(k) and Traditional IRA as being accounts that allow you to avoid paying taxes at whatever bracket you are at now in exchange for paying taxes at your future rate. An efficient saver would look to stock away as much as possible if they are in the highest tax bracket. In retirement, they will lose their salary and be living off of savings, pension, or social security, and can withdraw funds and pay tax as needed at that time. 

When it makes sense to make “pre-tax” contributions: High Income Tax Bracket $400,000 Salary $17,000 (Max Allowable 401k contribution)----------------- sent to 401(k) End result is $383,000 Taxable Income plus $17,000 in 401(k) At this salary range, the employee falls into the 35% tax bracket. If he had elected to not send $17,000 to his 401(k), he would have had to pay tax on that $17,000 at 35% ($5,950). He would have an extra $11,050 [($17,000 (gross)-$5,950 (tax owed)] in his pocket today, but at this salary range, he probably does not need that extra $11,050. So let’s fast forward this same year for 10 years. After ten years and assuming a 0% rate of return, he would have saved $170,000 in his 401(k). At the 35% tax bracket, this means he has delayed paying a tax bill of $59,500 (35% of 170k) into the future. This is almost $60,000 that would have gone to the federal government that is instead sitting and accruing interest in his 401(k). 

Now at age 59½, assume he retires and can now begin taking penalty-free withdrawals from this account. He is not generating his $400,000 annual salary anymore and is only living off of social security, his pension, and his 401(k). Let’s assume his annual income between all of these investments is $80,000. This puts him in the 25% tax bracket. Now, when he takes distributions from his 401(k), he pays tax at the 25% tax rate. Lets assume his pension and social security total $56,000 so he only needs to take a $34,000 annual withdrawal from his 401(k). Over the course of 5 years, his $34,000 401(k) distributions are taxed at 25%. By the time he has withdrawn all $170,000, he would have paid $42,500 in tax. Remember that if he paid tax on the 401(k) monies when he was at the 35% tax bracket, he would have paid $59,500 in taxes on $170,000. By utilizing the 401(k), he gets away with only paying $42,500 in tax. A savings of $17,000 that greatly increases as accounts get larger.

Mutual Funds and Stocks basics:

Within a Roth IRA, you have a multitude of various investment options. The most popular being mutual funds. What is a Mutual Fund? To understand what a mutual fund is, it would help to understand first what a Stock is: What is a Stock? Simply put, a stock share represents ownership in a company. When you buy Coca-cola stock, you are in essence, becoming a part owner of the coca-cola company. You give them cash, they give you a share in the company and use your money to fund their operations. If they do well and make profits and are a successful business, the value of the stock should rise over the long term. Also if you happen to invest in Coca-cola before a major unexpected announcement that drives demand for the stock, the value of your shares may rise. 

Unfortunately, a good stock is not always a good company and a good company is not always a good stock. This is where individual investing can get complicated. Inexperienced investors or even experienced analysts may read all of the financials and fundamentals in a business and see a solid platform for growth, however, if too many people have thought the same thing, the stock could be overvalued and not make much a return. There are literally thousands of different events that can drive the value of a stock up or down. If you look at a single company there can be micro/internal events that drive up or down the stock price and there can be macro/external events that can drive up or down a stock. 

Here are a few examples of issues that have driven stock prices up and down in the past: Micro/Internal events - These are events that are unique to the company itself and its internal management. An example of an internal event raising a stock price is how in 2012, Yahoo’s stock rose 3.1 percent in one day after they announced they were firing their CEO Scott Thompson. Other internal events can be the announcement of landing a new major contract or business. The point is that a company’s stock can rise if the outlook for their business increases by actions they take as a company. 

Macro/External events – These are events that effect whole markets, economies, or countries. For example, it didn’t really matter how well diversified one was in 2008, just about every sector and size company fell in value. Coca- cola stock, in 2008, fell in value by approximately 30%. Was this due to a competitor coming in and taking away beverage market share? Was this due to mismanagement or poor business practices? No, it fell as a result of the collapse of the financial market stemming from banks trading mortgages that were handed out like candy to any and everyone who wanted one in the preceding years. We will get into that more later, but the bottom line is that you can be invested in the hottest stock in the world and still lose money if a war breaks out or if there is a macro-type event that causes the overall value of assets to fall. Macro/External events can also have the opposite effect. If you happen to invest in a stock in a period where general markets are rising, you may think you have become this expert investor able to generate returns at will. 

Unfortunately, full companies and full businesses can also get caught up in the rising market economy and generate profits and returns more out of luck than management or business skills. Warren Buffet once said, “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.” In other words, only when markets collapse and earnings disappear do we find out who the smart businesses are that are structured to weather such a swing. There are dozens of different types of stocks you can invest in. 

There are also just as many ways to categorize a stock. Many people fall in love with trading stocks for some reason or another. Let me just clarify that it is extremely difficult to make consistent returns trading stocks as a day trader. Remember the more successful you are at day trading, the higher the tax you pay on your gains and also the higher your trading commissions. 

For example, let’s say you make a good trade and turn a $1,000 investment into $5,000. You may think, great! I made$4,000 profit, that’s enough to pay for my expenses for a month! However let’s look at true returns in this case: First, to buy $1,000 worth of stock and then to sell the stock when it is worth $5,000 means that you have generated $4,000 worth of short term capital gains. Let’s say that you are a good enough trader to generate $100,000 worth of gains a year (extremely difficult and risky, but let’s say you can do it). A $100,000 income puts you in the 28% tax bracket. This means that in addition to fees associated with maintaining a brokerage account and trading, you have to pay $1,120 in tax on your profits. So the day trader that lucked out and hit a $4,000 profit actually only nets $2,880. 

This does not mean you cannot make money in the stock market, you can certainly generate returns, but I would not focus on the stock market to be a significant source of short term income. Rather than invest in individual stocks (of which there are thousands), mutual funds have risen in popularity as a less aggressive strategy to participate in stock market returns. Let’s go back to Coca-cola stock to explain the mutual fund concept. Let’s say you are from Atlanta, have known Coca-cola your entire life, and thus invest your hard earned savings of $20,000 all into Coca-cola stock. Now, let’s say a new FDA report is released that shows Coca-cola to cause some type of serious illness. As a result, Coca-cola is banned and the company goes bankrupt as a result. Now your $20,000 invest in Coca-cola is now worth $0. So, rather than put all of your eggs in one basket/stock. 

A mutual fund is like a big bucket of stocks. Anywhere from 40-400 companies can make up one single mutual fund. So rather than invest solely in Coca-cola, you invest in a mutual fund that owns Coca-cola as a smaller part of a bigger whole. This way, if Coca-cola does indeed go bankrupt, your investment in the mutual fund would only partially be affected. If the mutual fund suffers unexpected losses from the position it held in Coca-cola, hopefully one of the other 400 companies it has invested in had an unexpectedly stellar year and offset the Coca-cola loss. Mutual Funds provide broad exposure to a large group of companies, typically sharing similar characteristics. For example, an International mutual fund is like investing in a big bucket of international companies. 

Rather than try to research thousands of countries and thousands of different international companies stocks’ you can just invest in an international mutual fund and have broad exposure to hundreds of different international companies. The benefit of mutual funds is that historically, domestic and international markets have been in a continuous state of growth. Someone that would have cast a net over thousands of different companies over the past decades would not have risked investing a majority of their funds in one company.",finance,1393512124

Bitcoin,FT 27/2/2013 The Bitcoin Personality Cult Lives On,"How to handle bad news, by public relations guru and propaganda expert Edward Bernays from his book Propaganda (1928):

The counsel on public relations must be in a position to deal effectively with rumours and suspicions, attempting to stop them at their source, counteracting them promptly with correct or more complete information through channels which will be most effective, or best of all establish such relationships of confidence in the concern’s integrity that rumours and suspicions will have no opportunity to take root.

—————-

A single factory, potentially capable of supplying a whole continent with its particular product, cannot afford to wait until the public asks for its product; it must maintain constant touch, through advertising and propaganda, with the vast public in order to assure itself the continuous demand which alone will make its costly plant profitable.


Keep that in mind, as we attempt to rationalise the response to recent news that Bitcoin exchange MT Gox has collapsed, accompanied by reassurances from the community’s biggest names that none of this impacts the potential of Bitcoin itself.

For it was Edward Bernays who first observed decades ago that mass production had changed the marketplace so fundamentally that companies would forever be reliant on propaganda to create demand where there was none. He termed this process “manufacturing consent”.

Bitcoin’s power, for obvious reasons, relies more than most on this process. Without mass manufactured consent, Bitcoin is nothing.

Bernays didn’t see any of this as sinister, mind you. In a free market, he argued, propaganda was simply a tool for competitive big business, whose goal was always to get bigger, more powerful and more monopolistic. If one particular company or faction’s propaganda came to dominate too much, there shouldn’t be anything stopping another from offsetting or countering that propaganda with their own propaganda.

Modern democratic capitalistic society, in other words, was geared towards propaganda wars. A constant battle over hearts and minds, so much so that — for the most part — we have become completely oblivious to the conditioning we are exposed to.

Up for grabs (for the most effective practitioners, at least) are the trappings of guaranteed demand, profit and power.

It isn’t entirely Wild West, mind you. Some degree of regulatory oversight exists. Though, of course, it’s focused mostly on differentiating fact from fiction, or prohibiting propaganda that encourages self-destructive behaviours or products (such as tobacco), a consensus itself ironically achieved via offsetting propaganda efforts — lobbying and campaigning — of more ethically or socially minded groups. Nevertheless, none of this stops expert practitioners from exploiting society’s base desires, lusts and wants to serve their needs irrespective of the ethics.

Hence why it’s still acceptable to indoctrinate children with detergent adverts in between cartoons. Having kids pester their parents to buy this or that isn’t seen as exploitative, it’s seen as clever marketing.

But what Bernays also noted was that propaganda was most effective when it focused on validating or furthering the causes of particular social groups. i.e. when it helped to align the interests of business with politics.

Back when Bernays was writing, of course, the gateway to manipulating public opinion was restricted to a small group of PR practitioners and propagandists due to the costs associated with gaining access to mass market media.

Today, however, the internet — and social media in particular — has changed that completely. The propaganda industry has been disrupted to the same degree by social media as conventional business was disrupted by mass production processes so many years ago.

Anyone with a Twitter account has the means to become a successful propagandist.

The greatest shift is that most propaganda is no longer dominated by corporate interests striving to command our hearts and minds so that they can sell us more products. Propaganda is instead being used by us to sell ourselves to our peers.

Whereas old style corporate messages pandered to our ego by convincing us that this or that product can make us project a better version of ourselves, today we can jump over that entire process thanks to the many direct outlets for heavily manipulated self projection.

Propaganda crowded out

But, while the universalisation of propaganda may have provided ever more of us with these awesome propaganda tools, it has also debased its worth. Attention span, after all, is finite. Millions, if not billions, of voices (both private and corporate) now compete against each other to influence public opinion on a daily basis.

Think of it this way. Proctor &amp; Gamble isn’t competing with Pepsico for your attention span anymore, it’s competing with the pictures and videos of cats, food and holidays posted by your nearest and dearest. What’s more, the more corporations try to butt into the private propaganda space, the more we grow to resent them. This is because personal propaganda is far more powerful and engaging than corporate propaganda could ever hope to be.

In that context, the traditional strategy of pandering to our egos — mostly by promoting the ethos that this or that product can make you the person you want to be — simply doesn’t do the trick anymore.

We don’t need unnecessary “aspirational” products to make our ego feel good. We’ve got online tools to propagate and project whatever image of ourselves we want to. We’ve got apps that photoshop our spotty faces. Apps that help us turn home videos into Hollywood quality movies. Apps that allow us to engage in oneupmanship. Apps that help us eat less, not more.

And just like conventional propagandists before us, we have no qualms about doctoring our photos, being liberal with the truth or glossing over reality in a bid to enhance the image it presents to those it’s seeking to influence or coerce.

True, corporate interests are still trying to harness the power of private propaganda for themselves. But — in the new open propaganda war — that means getting people to associate their own narcissistic self-promotion with their products. That’s a big ask, given that time spent promoting products is less time spent promoting yourself, and your online desirability.

In our minds, no product is more important than ourselves. And that’s because the ultimate reward of propaganda, if used wisely, is the sort of hierarchal positioning that was previously only ever associated with dictator-level personality cults.

The best propagandists understand this. They understand that people will only promote a product if it helps them promote themselves at the same time. Yet herein lies a fundamental paradox.

As Caesar and Augustus knew only too well, a personality cult will never successfully penetrate public minds if it is too focused on itself. Conversely it needs to be masterfully disassociated from self promotion, and re-associated with altruistic value, humour, or benevolence. In Caesar and Augustus’ case it was only through publicly rejecting kingly power, that they were able to create a much more powerful empirical office to replace it.

A masterful slight of hand and example of misdirection.

Sophisticated personal propaganda campaigns can be differentiated from unsophisticated ones in exactly this way. The distribution of highly doctored selfies eventually begins to nauseate. No-one likes a narcissist or a megalomaniac. Meanwhile, too much association with high-end products or exclusivity meanwhile backfires with the “Rich Kids of Instagram” effect.

Today’s most effective propaganda consequently is the sort that inspires people to care about things other than themselves. It’s not aspirational as much as experience or ideology based.

Red bull was an early trailblazer on this front, disassociating itself almost entirely from the product in its marketing and focusing on fun, experience and radical individualism. The ads don’t sell the product, they sell a brand, which in reality is a social protocol for a different (more enjoyable) way of life. An ideology focused on experience not consumerism.

Which finally brings us back to Bitcoin.

As we noted before, Bitcoin can’t survive without manufacturing consent for its ideology. In the new open propaganda era that means getting as many people as possible to associate their own self-promotion with Bitcoin, and its success. What we’ve seen in the last few years, consequently, is one of the most sophisticated propaganda strategies ever deployed in this regard.

All the more impressive because it’s been portrayed as being fully grass roots in nature.

Yet, as we’ve already noted, no propaganda campaign can be successful in the long run if it depends too much on narcissistic self-promotion. The trick, consequently, is appealing to the personality cult desires of the masses, but at the same time making them appear somehow altruistic or socially minded.

As an ideology, Bitcoin captures and enlists minds by achieving that balance perfectly.The fundamental message of the movement being that its success empowers you, and with it everyone else.

It is, in short, the sort of propaganda more commonly associated with political indoctrination.

And yet the paradox is that it actually serves the old-fashioned corporate interests of those who understand, as ever, how to exploit the system’s followers to their own ends.

Just like Caesar, Bitcoin publicly rejects concentrated authority as a form of misdirection. It promotes decentralised authority just to disguise the real power grabbing that’s going on below the surface.

The aim is the same as always: forging guaranteed demand for a product nobody needs, but which will bestow profits and power on a concentrated few without you noticing, mostly by appealing to our collective self-centredness. Those few are early adopters, the dominant miners and more recently the corporate interests that were quick enough to figure out that in the new open propaganda era, manufacturing consent for products nobody needs is much harder than propagating an existing Emperor’s Clothes delusion and creating businesses that can profit from it.

The collapse of MT Gox and the insistence by the likes of Andreessen, Horowitz, Winklevoss and Keiser that this doesn’t somehow undermine the system, consequently, speaks volumes about the real power play going on within.

Their spin, of course, is that the collapse of MT Gox was an important learning curve for the Bitcoin community, and one which can empower it. MT Gox got too big too quickly, and was fundamentally corrupt from the outset. Its collapse now makes way for a more prudent, better run and more powerful business. A new era of self regulation.

Caesar’s death similarly did not make way for the reconstitution of the old Republic, but rather opened the door to an emboldened Augustus and the establishment of the extremely long-standing Roman Empire.

That the emperor system was tantamount to kingly tyranny, mattered very little to the Roman people. By that point they were so enamoured and indoctrinated, and so fed up of civil war, they couldn’t care less that the old tyrannical system was being re-created right in front of their eyes. Either that or they bought so wholeheartedly into the myth of a new era, they chose to ignore the obvious signs that it was simply the old system which they had once rejected being reformed.

A similar cognitive dissonance is currently going on within the Bitcoin community, which seems little bothered about the contradictions associated with on the one hand rejecting authority, government and regulation, and on the other hand embracing Bitcoin’s transformation into a system that regulates its wild west elements, defends the hierarchal elite it has established, and in some cases even calls for government protection of the fantasy property rights it itself has created.

In other words, all of a sudden the community has no issue with empowering a central organised authority, favouring an established elite, or subscribing to Too Big Too Fail.

Most people would say you can’t have it both ways. Unfortunately, if you’re a Bitcoin enthusiast it seems you’re immune to such contradictions. And if that says anything at all, it’s that the new type of propaganda is more powerful than we probably appreciated.",cryptocurrency,1393521670

So what might have happened?

My guess is that Mt. Gox was working on fractional reserve. It was ""almost working"", until the transaction malleability allowed the draining of their hot wallet, causing severe issues with the liquidity of the assets. People were withdrawing more than they had available.

This wouldn't be a problem alone, but in Spring 2013 and later on August 2013 Feds seized funds from Mt. Gox not registering as a money transmitter in US. Investigation is ongoing.

-----------------------

Now the draining of hot wallet via transaction malleability would not cause issues IF they had access to their cold wallet, but it was most probably seized during the pending investigation. Either the bank was in US or the feds got Japanese authorities to seize it.

Pending investigation might have caused a gag order, which would explain the lack of information to the customers.

Karpeles tries to save the day, by trying to sell the whole business - which would give them back the solvency. He thinks that Mt. Gox is ""too big to fail"", and expects rest of the major Bitcoin players to bail them out.",cryptocurrency,1393522674

personalfinance,Help: Bankruptcy (CH 13/7) or Agree to Insane Short Sale Demands from Second Lender,"Hello PF,

Yes, I have contacted bankruptcy attorneys in both Florida and Connecticut, but I could really use some of your advice - since you guys rock. Sorry for taking up your time, but I respect the vast majority of what goes on in this thread and am at my wit's end. 

First, some background and current financial standings.

**Background**  
It's just me and the dog - no one else involved and no one else is listed on anything in my name (no co-signers, no one on my bank accounts or credit lines). I've been having panic attacks and need some guidance that I have seen this community is able to provide.  

I took a new role for work and had to leave Connecticut for Tampa, FL. I was going through a short sale (selling my property) that fell through several times due to my second lender taking so long to respond. Under the advice of my short sale attorneys I had stopped paying both mortgages and my association fees for the bank to respond to my short sale. I have stopped paying since July 2013 (2 mortgages and one association fee). These are the only things I stopped paying, everything else is completely current. Currently, I do have an offer on the property for 153k. The first bank agreed to accept the loss and pay the second lender 1k (they reneged on their previous agreement to take an offer at 150k and pay the second lender 6k). The second lender is demanding the full amount of the loan repaid over 5 years at a higher interest rate than I currently have (would now work out to ~700/month for 5 years).  

I am not in the financial industry, but do manage teams and budgets for my work (IT Team Leader). I have heard horror stories about how bankruptcy can impact future job prospects (although illegal, it's nearly impossible to prove).

**Current Debts**  
- $178,531 - First Mortgage (1400/mo including tax escrow)

- I did not file my 2013 taxes yet, but expect to get a few thousand back  
- $500,000 Life insurance Policy (this is not r/suicidewatch, just not sure if this is relevant or not so I included it)

**Monthly Expenditures**  
- $1,600 - Rent (includes all utilities and renter's insurance)  
- $700 - Auto  
- I try to keep the food/supplies to a minimum and gave up alcohol, as that was not helping my situation.

**Credit Rating**  
- Most of the damage has already been done, as I fell from *766* to *659* (as of today).

Thoughts? Other than being totally f'd in the a? ~~Should I file for chapter 13 and retain my possessions?~~ Should I go for Chapter 7 and wipe the slate clean? Should I accept the short sale offer and live in crushing debt for at least the next 5+ years while living off ramen and still racking up more debt? I know a big response will be to sell the car, but I most likely will not get enough for the remaining balance (possibly could), but would then be stuck for obtaining a new vehicle as my credit is now shit, so I don't think that is a quick fix, either.  

In retrospect, maybe I should have stayed in CT, but that really was not an option for me (I made a life decision to get out of there for my personal health) and this is where I currently am with things - I cannot add regrets to my current list of shit.

personalfinance,"Getting a new job where I need to incorporate (S Corp) and am lost when it comes to taxes and salaries (and dividends, oh my!)","Hi /r/personalfinance! I'm going to be starting a new job soon at 130k a year, with a rather special circumstance. As part of the terms of me being hired, I need to set up a S Corp, and essentially be business to business in terms of the relationship with the company.

I know it sounds super sketchy for a company to require me to do that, but it makes sense in context. I am 20 years old, and HR would never green light 130k for a 20 year old dude, so this is the solution that was proposed.

I understand that I take on more taxes because of me being self employed (the other half of the taxes normally paid by the employer), but I am lost as to how to count anything. I should be paying myself a salary, and then paying the rest through dividends correct? Are there any sort of step by step guides on how to do this correctly?

Also, is there a way (short of sitting down with a CPA) to calculate my take home pay when counting dividends and federal/state/local taxes? I looked online at tax calculators, and they either seem too simple, or vary wildly. Some say that I would owe 10k total per year (seems too low) and some say that I would owe 50k total per year (seems wayyy to high).

Furthermore (sorry for the wall of text), I'd like to setup some sort of retirement account (or accounts), but since I will be self employed I'm not sure what avenue to take.

I have contacted a CPA in the area to setup an appointment to get incorporated, but was looking for some advice from more voices on the questions above. Thanks!

TL;DR - 20 year old dude got new job for 130k a year, and needs to setup S Corp. Not sure of what to do, or how to pay myself, or how to calculate my taxes, or how to handle retirement.

personalfinance,"401k check from previous employer. Past 60 days, what do i do?","Hey guys, 

I got a check from my previous employer on 12/03/2013 for $185.37. I worked there briefly so that was what i had in my 401k savings plan. They also sent me a letter prior stating: 

""If your vested account balance is less than $1000, you have 60 days to roll over your money or request a distribution. If you do not elect tone of these options within this time, your vested balance will automatically be distributed to you by check""   

""Important Tax Notice about Plan Distributions: If your account balance is paid directly to you, 20% of the taxable amount will be withheld and sent to the IRS. If you roll over the entire distribution within 60 days of receiving it, the 20% withholding will be credited toward your taxes. ANY PORTION THAT IS NOT ROLLED OVER WILL BE TAXABLE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. Taxable distributions may also be subjected to state withholding, based on your state's tax rules, as well as 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59 1/2"" (I'm 23)     


I was out of the country for a month and forgot to open these letters until last week. Can i get some advice on what to do with this check? Should i put it into an IRA so i don't get taxed or is it too late? I already have a Scottrade brokerage account, should i open an IRA with them or is the amount too low? 

My dad just did the taxes a couple days ago and i hope this doesn't mess things up. He's out of the country now taking care of family matters so i don't want to bother him. He told me i will be getting about $900 back from money withheld last year. Because this 401k was issued last year and i failed to do anything with it within 60 days, will there be some kind of penalty? Was i supposed to report this check to the IRS as a gain? I don't know anything about taxes and would appreciate any advice i can get. 

Thank you



Update:
I also read this on Scottrade's site about IRAs:


Tax considerations Even though that 20% amount withheld isn't included in the check you receive, you must provide it from another source if you want the full amount of your rollover to remain tax deferred. Furthermore, any amount that isn't deposited within the 60-day limit loses its tax-deferred status for good. (i am past 60 days)


Also i forgot to mention i actually got a tax form mailed to from previous employer and it shows Gross distribution - $185.37 and Taxable amount - 185.37


Here is a picture of another letter i was sent. It doesn't show any federal or state withholding, only a forfeiture amount of $35.33 https://www.dropbox.com/s/3o6v3syr8kpl7zx/Photo%20Feb%2028%2C%2012%2035%2025%20PM.jpg",finance,1393555692

personalfinance,Mortgage payoff vs Investing,"First off, I want to thank anyone that has taken the time to read and provide comment to my inquiries. 

A little about me: I am 25 years old, married with 2 kids, and purchased my first home on 3/1/2013. My wife and I make about 75k a year combined from our jobs and I make another 40k (tax-free military benefits) each year- total of about 115k a year. 

Assets:
Prior to leaving the military, my wife and I were able to save up about 18k in savings for an emergency fund. Because I bought the home with the VA Home Loan Program, the money was not used for a down payment for the house (as originally planned) and is now our emergency savings. I also have 1200 invested in stock. I have a TSP that I contribute 5% of my salary to, which gets matched.  

Debt:
The only debt I have is the mortgage (originally 300k) of $274,900 at 3.25%, $5500 in credit card debt (currently 0% APR until June which we will pay off), and my wife's student loans (13k deferred until Dec 2016). There are no car notes at the moment and we have a  leftover surplus each month (after bills) of about $1000, which we are currently using to pay down the credit card.  

My question is this: I have composed an amortization table schedule that will allow me to pay the mortgage off in 5 years (currently paid off 25k since last year) with my extra tax-free income. However, I often hear people say that, if an interest rate for a mortgage is that low, it's better to invest in the market where you can average 4-5% return. How can it be better if my mortgage interest rate, although technically lower, is still outweighing my current on-hand capital that I can invest? 

I've done the math: I make 3657 in tax-free income every month. 

3657 x 12 months=43,884

43884 x .05 = 2194 interest a year.

Mortgage: 300k x .0325 = 9750 interest a year.

Perhaps I'm doing the math wrong or should I just pay off my mortgage (my idea at the moment), so that I can own it outright by 30 yrs old? That would allow me to invest the current monthly mortgage payment of 1555 a month + extra income and truly grow my net worth without one of the biggest worries of a person's life (mortgage). 

Thanks for your help!

Second, I am currently paying the minimum balance on all loans except the 9k @ 9.38 interest. On this loan I've been putting an extra thousand a month to try to get it paid off as quickly as possible. However, once that loan is paid off do I tackle the 6.55% loans or start saving?

$5k signing bonus with a tax gross up

Here's what I actually got paid:

~ $13k during the summer

$5k signing bonus

It seemed like they were withholding too much. The other interns noticed this too. We figured we would just get large returns come April. I just got my W2.

Here's my ""wages, tips, and other compensation"": **$41k** 

~$7.7k federal income withheld

~$2.5k social security withheld

~$600 medicare withheld

~$2.7k state income withheld

Setting aside the question of withholding/taxes, there is something like $15k-$16k of compensation left after you take out the paychecks and bonus (depends on how big the gross up on the bonus was). 

There were free meals in the cafeteria every day, and they deducted $600 per month from my paycheck for corporate housing. It was a two-bedroom in San Francisco, so suppose that cost them $4k a month. Given that my roommate (another intern) and I were each paying the $600, that makes about $1.5k per month in compensation for each of us. That still leaves over $10k in compensation, which seems like way too much for cafeteria meals. 

Now, the W2 doesn't give me this breakdown at all, it just gives the total $41k number. Does this seem unreasonable?

I think we all know about the Mt. Gox debacle, unfortunately it might not be over yet, and for some of you it might just be starting

For starters, in case you guys didn't know this on 6/28/2013 Mt. Gox was registered as a money services business (MSB). This was in response FinCen seizing on of Mt Gox's accounts. One of the FinCen requirements is that any transactions over 10K, require filing a form 104, now unlike filing an IRS form 8300, no one has to inform you that a 104 was filled out on you. You can bet that if you made a transaction for more then 10K or multiple transactions that added up to 10K after 6/28/2013 then you are on the FinCen radar and FinCen works very closely with the IRS (in fact form 8300 is actually a joint FinCen/IRS form). Now I'm not sure about transactions previous to 6/28/2013, maybe FinCen required Gox to go back and file for previous years, but honestly I don't know. However with Gox being bankrupt you can bet that federal prosecutors, IRS agents, SEC agents, FinCen agents etc... Are going to be going through their files with a fine tooth comb, and if they find something suspicious, you can expect a letter in the mail. So choose your options very carefully, but just know that if you did any business with Gox you are going to be on the radar. 

Now this is the really fun part, any of you guys that made money in Gox in the last few months might want to consider holding that money aside until all the lawsuits are settled. I know there is a certain provision that allows for a ""clawback"" of profits made from ponzi schemes. How the clawbacks work, or how likely they are, I honestly don't know. Hopefully a lawyer with experience in this issue can see this and fill us in. It could be totally bunk for all I know, but I do know, that during the Madoff bankruptcy over 400 clawback suits were filed. Again this could be completely inapplicable here, I'm not a lawyer but would love to hear input from one on this issue.

The bitcoins cannot be withdrawn from the site and are insured by the exchange if the trader get liquidated.

There is currently a shortage on Bitcoins on that exchange (fear from the MtGox collapse), and so the interest rate has jumped to a whopping 54.75% annualized (usually hovers around 2%)!  It's nearly risk free returns and a great way to take the stress away from a declining price.

investing,Total market cap to GDP ratio distorted thanks to QE?,"Full disclosure; I have some cash I wish to invest but the ATH´s are holding me back. In 2007 I had a lot of money in stock and freaked out just before the plunge because... well, ATH´s scare the shit out of me. And now we are back.  
Now, one of the indicators Warren Buffet relies on when valuing the overall market is the [total market cap to GDP ratio](http://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php). This ratio is currentyl at over 115% which is to be considered ""Significantly Overvalued"". On top of this we have the Schiller P/E ratio at above 25 (20 being the historical mean). So according to these we are definetly in an overvalued market.  

Now to the question; how will the QE of recent play in to these ratios? The FED-sheets are up about $4 trillion compared to the GDP of $16 trillion. Obviously not all of that cash flows into the stock market but it has to effect ratios like the ones above mentioned.  

What are your thoughts on this? Am I just overly cautious? I want to get in to value investing to build dividend cashflow for reinvestment but getting in at what seems to be the top is probably the worst idea. Or am I missing out on a bull market that is here to stay? (Yellen seems willing to keep pushing more liquidity into the markets if things don´t improve and a big dip in the stock market could possibly be one of the factors for her to intervene)

Also, please refrain from political discussions regarding QE, beyond reasoning about QE´s future incorporation those discussions are not interesting here",finance,1393591912

I'm a (just turned three weeks ago) 26 year old on a $60k salary. I'm living pretty comfortably and fairly frugally, though I'd really like to get as debt free as possible - mostly my student loans.

I just closed on a house this week and have $5k in my emergency fund. The house is in great shape and was fairly cheap (116k) and I put $15k down on it with a 4.6% rate. I've already finished furnishing it and everything so there are no further additional financial necessities to be covered. 

My expenses are looking like this:

$830 mortgage, $315 student loans, $300 groceries, $300 utilities, $160 gas for car, $75 car insurance, $95 phone, $400 ""slush fund"" - this is for like going out, buying a game, seeing a movie, etc.

Note: these are rough estimates. I imagine they'll fluctuate a bit.

I don't have car debt (paid for my 2008 Yaris with 38k miles on it with cash) and no credit card debt. I've been putting 6% into my 401k since I was 23, and my employer contributes 3%, regardless of whether or not I contribute anything.

My student loan debt sits at $20k with interest rates of 6.55%, and it's broken up by 4 loans of varying amounts. The smallest one is $3500. With the extra money that I have left over per month (around $550), I was going to put that towards paying the principal until my lowest loan is paid off, then snowballing that into my next one.

Another thing is that my girlfriend will be moving in come October, and while she doesn't save a ton of money, it will free up money for me to pay off my loans faster - probably an additional $500 a month if we split the mortgage and utilities.

The questions I have are:
A) Would it be wise of me to just not contribute to my 401k and put that money towards the loans since my employer already contributes 3%?
B) Are any of my estimates unrealistic? Are there ways to cut some of these numbers down?
C) Is this a healthy financial plan, or am I missing something? Am I on a good path? My idea was to pay off the student loans, then pay off my girlfriends, then up our investment savings to 15-20% and make extra payments towards the house.",finance,1393599236

I freely admit that I've about as fiscally irresponsible as it can get but I want to make things right (or as right as I can)

I joined the military for many reasons, one of which was to try and give myself a fresh start with finances. I've been living check to check on minimum wage for years now and my savings have almost been all the way exhausted (&lt;$800). Soon enough I won't have to worry about rent, electric bills, food, etc. and will only have to worry about continuing to pay off my student loans.

Since I'll be moving to areas, I figure it would be prudent to switch banks since the one I have now is only regional. In fact, the nicest perk that came along with their checking account (10 free non-affiliated ATM withdrawals per month) has stopped since I graduated (a couple years ago...) and I've been meaning to find a new home anyhow.

I got a credit card with that bank when I first opened up accounts with them and immediately had the fear of God scared into my by family members saying ""CREDIT CARDS WILL RUIN YOUR FUTURE! DON'T USE IT AT ALL! YOU SHOULD JUST CUT IT UP AND FORGET ABOUT IT, YOU'LL THANK ME LATER!"" So I did... never got another credit card and still kept the account open. That was probably when I was 18, I'm currently 24. Be honest, how bad was that move? But more importantly, *how can I work through this and fix it?*

Recently, I've tried to research more into helping myself out but this world of personal finance is absolutely massive and really intimidating (hence why I'm coming to this sub). I've been reading more into online banks for checking and savings accounts. I saw something in **I Will Teach You to Be Rich** saying that Schwab checking awesome and their perks all seem relevant to me (good online experience, overdraft protection, no fees/minimums, unlimited ATM reimbursement, etc.) and ING Direct Savings are great as well usually with very competitive interest rates. Even more recently, my recruiter has been telling me about Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA (but have no direct or indirect experience with anyone who has used it). 

I guess my question is what everyone's experience has been with any of those groups? Good bad or ugly. My reasoning for going for an internet-based bank or the NFCU is more of a convenience issue since I'll be moving around a bunch. No reason to stay with my regional bank (Midwest) if I'm going to be in Texas or out West most of my time, right?

My goal for the short term is to right myself financially, get my credit score up (currently unknown but it can't be too good. Where can I find it?), get an introductory credit card with a low limit to help build it up, set up better bank accounts (high interest savings and an awesome checking account or two), have them automatically pay bills monthly, and after I have a good foundation to work off of, move on to worrying about a 401k, Roth IRA, and investing.

Gold is similar but in order to get around capital controls, you'd need to offshore it somehow which is costly and risky for various reasons.

You can easily offshore and protect your wealth by simple paper wallets stuffed between a few book pages or by a brain wallet (I think most people could understand that concept after seeing the paper wallet).

personalfinance,Trying to save for a house. What are my best savings options?,"A little background: 23, college freshman (I started late due to poor health), USA.

I have a goal of buying a house in 5 years. As of January, I've been able to put away ~$1000/month toward this goal between two jobs and a trust fund. Even if I lost both my jobs (highly unlikely), I could still put away about this much each month for the next 5 years. My goal is to save $60k for a downpayment on a house in 5 years. My current savings account through PNC has a *very* low interest rate.  I'm looking for a savings solution so that my money can grow more quickly, but I don't know what my options are. Help!",finance,1393626603
personalfinance,Bonehead question about interest on a savings account.,"Hey! So, my SO and I have had a savings account with Capital One 360 (formerly ING Direct) for awhile now, and we've finally started buckling down and saving in it. There's 1k in there as I write this. It says that the interest rate on it is .75% APY. What is APY, and how does the interest accrue? Sorry for the dumb question, I just want to learn more about this. 

Also, if there a better savings account with higher interest I should be looking into, all suggestions would be helpful. We're not looking to start investing the money right now, we're just trying to build a fairly liquid cushion at the moment. 

Thanks!",finance,1393628805
Bitcoin,Tax attorney: MtGox collapse and federal subpoena means that US taxpayers should seriously consider filing the appropriate foreign account disclosures (as well as accurately reporting their income).,"The MtGox fiasco provides a perfect opportunity for a government crackdown on what is perceived to be rampant non-compliance amongst the bitcoin community.   This includes not only the underreporting of bitcoin income, but also the failure to file necessary foreign account disclosures.  

In [my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1uccfz/i_am_a_tax_attorney_here_are_my_answers_to_the/) last month, I strongly cautioned that foreign bitcoin exchanges (like MtGox) are probably ""foreign financial accounts"" for purposes of the US reporting requirements.  I also said that the IRS has many ways of finding taxpayers who don't comply with these requirements. 

Now that MtGox has received a federal subpoena and filed for formal bankruptcy protection, there is all the more reason to presume that US authorities will be able to obtain your account information from MtGox, including your trading and account balance history.

If you had an account at MtGox that had a value of more than $10,000 at any point during the year, you should strongly consider filing the necessary FBAR forms.  As discussed in my prior post, the penalties for failing to file are extreme and can include criminal prosecution.  

You should also accurately report your bitcoin income, especially any amounts traceable to your MtGox account(s).  Its not worth the risk of penalties and potential criminal charges just to save a few dollars on your taxes.

**Tl;Dr** Your MtGox account information is no longer secret or confidential.  There is a strong likelihood that the US government will obtain your account information and check whether you properly reported the account and/or your income.",cryptocurrency,1393629026
