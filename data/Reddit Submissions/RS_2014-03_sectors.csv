personalfinance,Looking for feedback and advice on my current financial position,"27 yr old married 2 kids with stay at home spouse - Financial position:

----------------------------

68k gross income
122k 15 year 3.5% mortgage (we own 23% of the condo, no PMI)

40k student loans, 38k is variable interest currently at 2.8-3.07% (not worried about the remaining 2k at 6.8% there's a specific reason it isn't paid off yet)

72k in retirement. No matching plan, option to pay into a 457(b) which can be withdrawn early at no penalty if I no longer work for current employer (we may move in the next 5-10 years, so early withdraw at no penalty is relevant, could also be used as backup to EF if I somehow got fired)

5k emergency fund cash always on hand. Monthly expenses are about $3500. In addition I have 5k in vacation time that is fully vested, accrued, and can be withdrawn for cash payment during any pay period. I know this isn't 6 months, but I do have short and long term disability insurance, very very secure employment, and a very small maximum out of pocket on medical costs ($2,000 annual for entire family after $1,200 family deductible). I'm thinking this should be sufficient for our needs?

About $700 a month extra in revenue over expenses.

-----------------------------

Where should I be focusing that extra money? The variable interest rate loans are riskier as those become a little more painful if the interest rates jump to 6-7% in the next couple years. We are planning on having more kids in the next couple years (my income will also be increasing after I pass the four CPA exams this year.

personalfinance,Finance Advice - I am in a housing bubble and recently purchased a home. Need some advice on hedging.,"Hi all, I am a Canadian living in Alberta, Calgary to be exact. I recently purchased a home here in the city.

I feel as thought we were slightly naive before getting into it, and didn't fully understand the market. 

We (my girlfriend and I) purchased a 1500sq foot home in a community in the City for $349,000. We put down 5% as a down payment, and after CMHC (canadian mortgage insurance) we were in at around $345000 or so. 2.8% interest rate for 5 years.  Our mortgage payment is $1600 monthly.

Anyways, projections here are that we are in a housing bubble. Prices are 'supposed' to decline and rates are supposed to go up. The national interest rate average is around 9.8%, and I am fearing when rates go up our mortgage payment is going to be quite high, and we could possibly lose some money on the investment due to lower value. 

What do you think we can do to hedge against this uncertainty? Can we simply pay more down on the principle while we can? Or should we go at it another approach, (get out now,rent, smaller home, abandon canada,etc)

Your help is appreciated.",finance,1393640590

Aso said he had foreseen difficulties for the crypto-currency, which is generated by complex chains of interaction among a huge network of computers around the planet.

business,Corliss Online Group Financial Mag: Can Hong Kong Solve Scotland’s Currency ‘Fankle’?,"Scottish nationalists are in a quandary: how to dissolve the three-century bond with the United Kingdom while preserving their monetary link with the British pound.

And Hong Kong may provide the answer.

Nationalists want to retain the British pound if they win September’s independence vote, but U.K. political leaders ruled out sharing sterling earlier this month. They fear taxpayers would have to back Scotland in times of economic trouble, much as shared use of the euro forced Germany to bail out Greece.

Ditch the union if you want, but say goodbye to sterling, is the message from London.

This creates a bit of a fankle – a Scottish term for a state of disarray, even panic – for the Scottish nationalists. But they may have another card to play.

A currency board could allow Scotland to effectively keep the pound even without consent from the Bank of England, said John Greenwood, the chief economist at Invesco who helped design Hong Kong’s dollar peg, which has held for 31 years.

“If Scotland were to set up a currency board for a Scottish pound that remained at parity (1:1) with the English pound, the trade, current and capital account balances of Scotland would remain broadly unchanged, unless there was some major change in the economic circumstances of either country,” he said in an email.

This arrangement would require sufficient foreign reserves in British pounds to fully cover the amount of currency in circulation and the total held on deposit by commercial banks for interbank clearing transactions. Hong Kong, for example, holds $312.2 billion. See more Financial News: http://corlissonlinegroup.com/blog/

Some naysayers argue it might be hard for Scotland to build up such reserves.

Nomura, in a research report, contends that raising the required amount of reserves could be a “painful” process for Scotland. The bank asks how much of the U.K’s foreign reserves an independent Scotland would be entitled to in the event of a breakup, estimating that a share proportional to the size of the Scottish economy would only provide $4.5 billion, or about 7% of the total reserves needed for a currency board. Scotland may also have to negotiate to draw down its share of the U.K.’s reserves held by the IMF.

A currency board might also make the Scottish pound vulnerable to speculative attack. Defending a currency board against short sellers can be politically painful, said Joseph Yam, a research fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who as chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, fought off speculators including George Soros’ Quantum Fund during the Asian Financial Crisis.

“In the case of capital outflow, for whatever reasons, interest rates could rocket to very high levels and severe pain correspondingly inflicted on those shorting the currency as well as the economy; the latter may be so politically unacceptable as to lead to political pressure to abandon the currency board arrangement,” he said in an email.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority declined to comment on whether it had been consulted over a Scottish currency board.

Britain has been beaten by speculators before.  George Soros’ attacks on “Black Wednesday” in 1992 forced the U.K. to break its fixed exchange rate with the precursor of the euro, trashing the economic credibility of the British conservative government, which would spend 13 years out of power.

The Bank of England hiked interest rates from 8.8% to as much as 15% before capitulating. Current Prime Minister David Cameron, then aged 25, worked behind the scenes on the government’s policy response.

Mr. Greenwood agrees that speculative attacks would be possible. However, he said, “If Scotland were to follow the disciplines of Hong Kong in relation to fiscal policy, banking soundness, and the avoidance of leverage then there should be nothing to fear, and the Scottish pound could maintain parity with the English pound.”

Hong Kong defended its peg during the Asian crisis by buying up HK$118 billion of stocks and index futures, a move which later drew praise from Mr. Soros himself.

Bitcoin,"I tried explaining Bitcoin in laymen to someone, it grew a crowd.. Correct me if I am wrong.","I was at a coffee shop on my computer dealing with bitcoin and someone saw the logo and asked me what it was all about.. I explain it different every time but this time I put it like this..

So lets say you want to exchange money with someone, what is the best way to do so if you can't do it face to face?

#1. You could send them cash in the mail.. It is unverified and requires absolute risk on the senders part. Could be intercepted or just straight denied of being received. This is basically like leaving an amount of cash in a bank safe-deposit box and allowing anyone to enter and claim it.. not a good idea!

#2. You could give them your credit card information, which is basically giving them access to ALL of your funds on that account. Basically allowing someone to clear you out, cause a huge debt/credit problem. The only good thing about this is credit card fraud department, still a pain but they monitor it.. I would consider this equivalent to allowing someone full access to not only your safe-deposit, but your entire account.. Only good news is the bank manager is looking over your stuff, RECORDING EVERYTHING.. Maybe thats a bad thing?

#3. You could sign up for an escrow service, such as Pay-Pal, though they claim to be something different. That is basically what it is.. You still have to give them FULL access to your entire bank account, and they still record everything. Atleast it is somewhat of an escrow, and you wont get wiped out, but possibly frozen.. I would consider this equivalent to having a 3rd party come in to your bank and audit you in exchange for pulling money out of your own safe-deposit box. Basically the same option as #1, just making it secure and providing insurance in exchange for recording the entire transaction and possibly freezing assets.

#4. You could send money through Bitcoin, an internet protocol that secures and verifies transactions almost immediately to anywhere in the world for pennies on the dollar.. You would never have to give someone full access to any of your funds, and you send the amount you wish to spend, unlike credit cards pulling the amount at their choosing... I consider this equivalent to having a group of 100 random people watching over your safe-deposit box that you chose how much money was in before the person has access to it.. Recording everything but keeping you anonymous aswell. Easily the best option, but I am being biased. 

This may be random BS.. But this explanation grew a crowd of about 20 and I would like to hear some input!",cryptocurrency,1393661408
Bitcoin,"A possible script: Mark Karpeles, the new Snowden","This is only my precognition, in other words it is only one possible script among plenty.
So please read through it with skepticism.

I am feeling that the shadowy part of the US gov wants to get the coins stored in Gox for free and illegally.
There are a couple of elements that make me think so:

- Mark Karpeles said that the coins are technically unavailable

- Mark Karpeles hinted at the fact the US government did not want them to disclose

- So far there is nothing in the block chain that shows that they lost 700k coins via transaction malleability.

- So far it seems rather that addresses that belong to Gox contain plenty of coins.

So Gox's coins (our coins) have not been stolen. They have been confiscated and the ""US gov"" does not want Mark to disclose the information that the ""US gov"" stole our coins.

Now, a new rumor says that Mark flew to HK.
That would be consistent with a situation where he would risk arrest or extradition if he decided to stay in Japan.

Going to HK, knowing that China is at war (financial war) with the US would make perfect sense.
In HK Mark would get protection in exchange of information.
The same thing happened with Snowden and Russia.

Snowden revealed the dirty surveillance of the NSA.
Mark could reveal the dirty tricks of the FED, in other words the dirty ticks of the financial agency of the US.

From there, very soon, around March 11th this year (my precognition gives me that date), the whole truth will be disclosed. The whole Bitcoin community would know that the coins have been confiscated illegally.

Under those circumstance, I predict a huge division among the bitcoin community happening around the same time:

- 50% of the community will be happy to ignore the confiscation saying that it was necessary to get rid of the shadowy exchange because of greed. I can already see that through the last statement of SecondMarket's CEO.

- 50% of the community will not tolerate and decide to ""fork"", which would mean to join other crypto community.

Again this is only what my gut feelings are trying to say to me.
At that stage this is only a possible script of what would happen over the coming days.",cryptocurrency,1393661446

personalfinance,Why are student loans a bad idea?,"Hey guys.

There always seem to be a general consensus, that student loans are bad. That people will be stuck in them forever, and that they can't afford them. And I get it, being in debt isn't nice. It isn't something we strive for. 
But aren't student loans some of the best loans that one could take?

Now I don't know the interest specific for the US student loans. But in Denmark there is a 4% interest while you study, and after you finish it drops to the national interest rate (sat by the Danish National Bank) + 1. So for instanse, the national interest rate is currently at 0%, meaning that the rate of a student loan will be 1%.
Note: this rate varies, but will always be lower than what the normal banks can offer.

This means, that the **best** interest for a loan, is in a student loan. 

So why does people dislike them?",finance,1393682475

Bitcoin,What happened at Gox: Every version that I've believed over the last 3 days.,"Here's the stories I've told myself over the last 3 days.

MK has lost a part of the keys, but tomorrow he cracks it with a brute force attack, gets the BTC, finds an investor to cover the fiat shortfall, steps down... everyone gets their money back, Gox is reborn.

Or The coins keys are permanently lost, we can all stare at our coins in the blockchain, the BF agree to a fork to bail out the investors (not Gox), the press gets all excited about how this decentralised system is really better than the system that Madoff used to fuck everyone. BTC grows and grows with confidence and lots of new users

Or The wallet keys are permanently lost, we can all stare at our coins in the blockchain, the BF refuse to fork on principle, confidence in BTC dwindles and is forever tainted in the minds of the public as that internet scam money... It never takes off, and ends up being used exclusively to buy stuff on second life.

Or The cold wallet was hot and did leak a bunch of money and we track down the perpetrator on account of them having an impossible amount of money to spend, He's the one with the volcano island that turns into a spaceship launch pad.

Or MK stole the money because he thinks its smarter to steal half a billion dollars which is a completely unspendable fortune rather than siphon off a few million here and there, which he could certainly get away with. He goes to prison for 2 years and comes out in time to see bitcoin price drop below $3.46, sells his fortune and buys a nice house, in secondlife.

Or The Maleability attack was actually a distributed attack where someone sold the software to do it, and the money is gone to lots of little thieving bastards, and the mr big that did very nicely will never be found.

Or MK used the BTC 3 years ago to pay off Coinlab just before the price went through the roof and now there's no hope of buying back the coins again. MK is deludedly hinting at the coins are recoverable because he think MT Gox is worth 400m usd and an investor will want to buy his train wreck company, for the Brand value. (too funny)

Or (this is the dumbest one but for completeness i did buy this for ano hour or two yesterday) The Mercan Govmen took my dam money. In the wake of the Coinlab fiasco, or as part of some NSA plot Snowden is yet to reveal, as they investigated DPR and SR, the FBI has been pulling the strings at Gox. Although how they would achieve this by making them run at a partial reserve is really unclear. But they just hate our freedom man. USA, USA!

Or the malleability attack caused them to run out of coins in the Hot wallet and the cold wallet is time locked, but a (possibly internal) hacker has got hold of the key and now it's a race between geeks to see who can unlock and move the BTC to safety the fastest when the timelocked wallet opens in 345436seconds time. MK can't talk about this because if people find out they could hack it too. (this is my personal favourite, I believed this one for almost a whole day)

Here's my thoughts on how this will effect BTC. Those that say the price is unaffected&gt; firstly it's down from 900 to 600. Secondly the usd value of a currency doesn't determine the success of a currency. that comes with adoption. Most uninitiated people thought BTC sounded shady before this. If they see users are stiffed out of 400m usd then that reputation will stick. At best it will set BTC adoption back several years, at worst it will slowly decline and be used for second life.

Anonymity of this currency is probably its most dangerous feature. I don't care if the government sees what I'm doing with my money, because I'm transferring it, and trading it. I'm not buying guns or drugs or stealing. And until that anonymity is removed by a solid exchange system that monitors who is putting money in and out, and verifying users of tumblers (I mean what the fuck are they for if it's not illicit?), then BTC will continue to be feared by regulators who will clamp it by the balls so tight we won't even be able to use it on second life. BTC doesn't need to prize it's anonymity to be a success.",cryptocurrency,1393692513

Bitcoin,[Stratfor] Examining the future of Bitcoin,"Edit: This is an email only investment newsletter that my dad gets. It's not available publicly. 

Bitcoin is a relatively new and unregulated electronic currency that allows the owner to buy, sell and trade anonymously without incurring high transaction charges. Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin has become the most prevalent of a number of so-called ""cryptocurrencies."" Some have heralded cryptocurrencies as potential challengers to financial institutions, especially in developing markets and regions where traditional banking infrastructure is underdeveloped. However, despite a positive reaction to Bitcoin from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, multiple nations have refused to acknowledge the currency. Thailand, Russia, Iceland and Vietnam have all rejected or banned it.

Bitcoin experienced a tumultuous February as Mt. Gox, an exchange that converted fiat currencies into bitcoins and vice versa, on Feb. 7 stopped withdrawals from accounts and ultimately shut down Feb 24. Finally, on Feb. 28 it was revealed that most of the bitcoins deposited into the exchange -- approximately $475 million worth -- had disappeared. Electronic currencies such as bitcoin are susceptible to cyberattack, as the Mt. Gox incident shows. Chief among other concerns about electronic currencies is their existence beyond governments' capital controls, making illegal activities such as money laundering relatively straightforward. Financial regulators and many observers say that cryptocurrencies are a speculative bubble waiting to collapse. But no amount of opposition can erase electronic currencies or the technology behind them.

Analysis
Central to the idea of currency is ownership, the fact that money can only belong to (and therefore be spent by) one person or entity at a time. In the digital era, electronic money is no different than any other computer file, which means that unlike physical money, it can be endlessly copied. Bitcoin is not the first attempt at creating an electronic currency, but it is the first digital tender to gain serious interest and backing. This is largely due to the efforts of Satoshi Nakamoto, a fictitious name or group, responsible for the ""Bitcoin protocol."" Prior to Bitcoin, electronic currencies required a third party, such as PayPal, to determine if one party still owned the money or had previously spent it, thus transferring ownership to someone else. The Bitcoin protocol solved this problem by creating a publicly viewable global ledger, showing the sequential transactions of all accounts using bitcoin.

Bitcoins are bought and sold on the Internet at places known as exchanges. Bitcoins are generally stored in a digital wallet and transactions are recorded in a shared public ledger known as the ""blockchain."" The currency is not controlled by a central bank, but is instead managed by an online community. Members with powerful computers are encouraged to maintain the transactional register by ""verifying the blockchain"" -- solving complex mathematical equations and adding another ""block"" of transactions to the existing chain. The process is known as ""mining"" because the verifier is rewarded with new bitcoins. The way the system works, new bitcoins will not be created after there are 21 million in circulation, which is projected to happen in the year 2140.

Bitcoin has both strengths and weaknesses as a currency. Accounts themselves are anonymous, but determining ownership through regulating exchanges or IP addresses is possible. Bitcoin also allows merchants to escape expensive transaction fees that are often consequence of fraud protection. This is because bitcoin transactions are not reversible and, from the point of view of the merchant, there is little inherent risk of fraud. But due to skepticism and the fact that this is a relatively new concept entirely, few merchants accept bitcoins. Potential markets are also being shuttered by some countries that are fearful of the unique opportunities that cryptocurrencies offer compared to traditional state-sanctioned fiat money.

Decentralized currencies like Bitcoin remain in their infancy. To achieve mainstream longevity, cryptocurrencies will need to become popular and user friendly or find acceptance with a gigantic corporation like Amazon. Governments have struggled to stop decentralized networks in the past, but with each evolution of government crackdowns on file-sharing programs, the programmers become more sophisticated. For example, when Napster became popular for file sharing and was taken down, Kazaa, another file-sharing application, was created instead. This has led to peer-to-peer networks that are so decentralized that they are nearly impossible to stop.

This will not prevent governments from trying to monitor, disrupt and partially regulate cryptocurrencies -- in extreme cases governments could also physically move to shut down exchanges -- so the programmers behind cryptocurrencies have to improve the reliability and security of their networks. Hardening exchanges against cyberattacks, or at least limiting their frequency, will be critical in instilling confidence.

Bitcoin as a Technology

Bitcoin is far more than a currency; it is a new technological platform. Currency is just one of many potential applications. While bitcoin itself may fail, its technological breakthrough -- the Bitcoin protocol -- can be used for other applications in computer science. Though observers have pointed to the Mt. Gox shutdown as proof bitcoin will fail, having one exchange shut-down is not a big deal, and bitcoins' value on other exchanges has yet to collapse since Mt. Gox's problems began in early February.

Over the last year, venture capitalists have been quick to invest money in startup businesses that approach bitcoin with unique ideas. One company envisions ""colored coins,"" essentially a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency where each individual coin represents another physical commodity. Colored coins would then act as a surrogate to trade anything from stocks to securities, traditional money or anything else. Other companies are attempting to connect Wall Street to digital currencies, planning to trade bitcoins or derivatives based on them. To do so would require oversight from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There is an ongoing movement to get the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve an exchange-traded fund for bitcoins, which are being looked at not just as a currency, but as an asset class all by themselves. Unlike gold, however, Bitcoin is also a currency in the sense that it is easily divisible as well as relatively fluid.

Geopolitically, the use of Bitcoin by financial institutions and venture capitalists is of secondary importance, but they do provide a growing user base. The first five years of Bitcoin saw an exponential growth in value as well as popularity. Like any new, free-floating currency, the worth of bitcoins has remained volatile. In order for Bitcoin -- or any other cryptocurrency -- to be widely adopted, there will need to be an increase in the number of outlets and potential users, and there must be overall confidence in the value and stability of the tender. All of this can only come with time.

Cryptocurrencies in the Developing World

The relative ease of moving bitcoins in and out of countries with harsh capital controls was demonstrated during the recent financial crises in Cyprus, Argentina and Russia. Even more recently, Bitcoin addresses have been used on protester's posters in Ukraine as a way to find financial support from abroad. Banking sectors can impose restrictions and limit the movement of conventional funds, but no such regulatory system exists for digital currencies. For frontier and developing markets, digital currencies provide a way for individuals to gain access to dollars and other more stable currencies. The underlying volatility of national currencies is a driver toward alternative tender.

Digital money has already revolutionized local economies in some developing countries, providing a functional way to escape capital controls or bypass technologies. M-Pesa is a mobile money transfer system that has become popular in several African countries. The system debuted in Kenya in 2007, and to date roughly one-third of all Kenyans have an M-Pesa account. As a result, the equivalent value of about one-third of Kenya's gross domestic product is now spent via phone. In July 2013, a technology known as Kipochi was developed to connect M-Pesa accounts with Bitcoin accounts. Currently, anyone in the world can send bitcoins directly to a third of people in Kenya with zero transaction costs. This becomes important when considering the number of workers employed outside their home country. Traditional remittances -- when foreign workers send money home -- are very expensive, with transaction costs upward of 30 percent. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin provide a significantly cheaper alternative.

Kenya's successful adoption of mobile payment methods is a reminder of the fact that bitcoins can be transferred as easily as sending an SMS message on a phone. Much of the developing world does not have access to financial institutions or traditional bank accounts, but even the poorest countries invest in robust telecommunications network architecture, and almost everyone has a cell phone. The proliferation of cell phones and a digital tender like Bitcoin could allow societies to skip technological phases, like the need to construct a massive and intricate network of landlines.",cryptocurrency,1393704081

gaming,My sony experience so far,"I'm curious if anyone is on their third PS4 system?

Not looking for pity just curious if anyone else is unlucky 

I bought the first one December 08, 2013 and waited until Dec 30 to use it, Christmas gift for myself. I started playing Warframe and noticed some graphical tearing, or FPS drops but thought it could just be that game. Played Killzone and noticed that it did it there too, but very slightly. Then with Outlast and AC4. I called customer support and they initially reported it as a hard drive error, thank god I called back and corrected that. They determined it was the GPU.

They had me send the system in in the coffin box they delivered along with a purchase receipt on Feb 10th. I waited and received a new system Feb 21st. 

When I initially powered on the new PS4 it got to the home screen then powered off on its own. I rebooted it and chalked it up as nothing. Then, while scrolling over to settings it crashed. When I rebooted it initially would not connect; pulsing blue lights on top. I tried a dozen or so times; different tv, different HDMI cables, tv inputs. Nothing. Then when it finally booted.  I was then prompted to update to 1.61 before I could go online and access my game collection. I was eager to try Warframe with a new system and presumably non faulty GPU. While updating the system crashed and rebooted. A window popped up and said Critical OS error, please report to Sony. I hit the accept box and reported said error to Sony. I was getting worried. 

I called customer support and was told to Initialize the system via the menu screens and download the OS onto a flash drive from my PC. This is where it died. During the initializing it powered off on its own. With over an hour remaining. It now only goes to blue flashing and the one time I got it to boot into safe mode it said there is No OS, please install via USB. Then instantly powers off. I would say of trying 100 times it blue pulses 98 times. I can't install the OS even if it would stay powered on because the video output is not working. 

After an hour on the phone explaining they said I will be getting another coffin, having to wait another 10 business days and possibly be offered an extension on my ps+ subscription, one free download of sony published games (MLB, Killzone, Knack) or 10 dollars wallet credit. 

I'm a bit insulted by the offer as I've spent hours and hours on the phone with them and an hour total trekking to FedEx all the way across town twice now. 

Called  (Feb 25) and was told Sony doesn't give any compensation for dead products and would not issue a refund for any ps+ time I was not able to use, nor would they issue any free games. I asked to speak to the highest up person possible and was able to squeeze 5 dollars to my wallet out of them. 

Today (Mar 1) I learned that my service request number doesn't work for checking status of repairs online, via phone and can only be looked up by calling and giving them my PSN ID.

But I've currently been plagued by numerous emails from Sony saying the exact same thing; ""a shipping box is on the way."" Only it already arrived and I sent the system in. I've got 6 emails saying the box is en route. 


TL;DR annoyed with sony and my shit luck. Lol. Not looking for pity just curious if anyone else is having such issues",technology,1393712482

Trading,AzJack's Review of the ES for Feb 2014,"I traded very little in February due to Other Stuff going on in my “life”. (Fellow traders, a “life” is all that stuff you used to do before you got involved in trading. It can be fun. Remember?) I sat down this morning to do my ES review for Feb 2014 and to plan my trades for next week. Here’s what I see:

**ES Monthly Chart**

February had the greatest range and the highest volume in the last four months. We made an ATH again yesterday, the last day of the month. Since October 2011, we’ve had 6 down months. Only two of those occurred consecutively.  As with all  other time periods, big monthly moves tend to be followed by consolidation.  I would expect next month to have a much smaller range than February did.

We are still well above the top of the Regression Channel that goes back to the March 2009 low, so a correction is likely. As of the end of February, the top of the channel is at 1800 and the midpoint is just above 1700. This particular bull market is either 2 1/2 or 5 years old, depending on how you categorize the first six months of 2011.

**ES Weekly Chart**

We had four consecutive non-down weeks in February. (The 3rd week was a spinning top formation: it closed at the price at which it opened.) During the current bull, we’ve had as many as nine consecutive up weeks, and never more than 3 consecutive down weeks. (January 2014.) Volume was all over the map in Feb. The first and last weeks had above average volume, and the middle two weeks were significantly below average in volume.

The push to an ATH on no significant economic news implies that this ATH is still the result of Fed money. That tells me we can expect more of the same as long as the Fed continues to pour new money into the market.

The Fed expects the job market and the overall economy to improve in 2014. If those expectations fail to materialize, and if the Fed responds by increasing it’s QE, then we should see this market push even higher. The current P/E on the SP500 is 19.70, which is a little high and would typically indicate it is overbought. However, with QE, I am not sure the old rules apply here.

The 50 Week SMA is at 1686 and the 100 week is at 1531. In other words, those moving averages are currently irrelevant. IF price gets back down into the regression channel, we can start paying attention to those support levels. Until then, they’re not worth looking at.

Resistance at the ATH of 1866.50. Support at 1844.75 and at 1732.25. Everything between those two support prices is up for grabs.

**ES Daily Chart**

5D ATR is now 19.36. 50Day SMA is 1814 and 100Day SMA is 1783. All of these are well out of a “normal” day’s range and shouldn’t come into play on Monday.

New support is now 1846 area, (this was the previous ATH. It is well within range, so we must look farther for the next support level.  I could make a case for the 1837 level as that was solid resistance for a time and is about 20 points from the Friday close.

Of course, our only resistance is the new ATH, so the next likely level above that is no higher than 1877ish. (One full 5D ATR above the last close.) In the absence of empirical evidence of resistance above us, I will turn to pivot points. These have R1 at 1868.25 and R2 at 1878. Good enough for me.

**Plan for Next Week**

I will be looking both long and short, and expecting to make trades that take into account the size of the 5D ATR, currently about 20 points.

I will want to enter my trades at the defined S/R points. At this point, I have only 3 legitimate points:  1847, 1857 and 1867. In the absence of more definitive points, I will use previous S/R levels like 1837 and Pivot Point levels like 1877.

The direction of my trade will be determined by two things:

1. Does the market have a trend in place? If so, I will trade in the direction of the trend, assuming I have a strong stop-loss trigger on the opposite side of an S/R area. If not, I will take a counter-trend move assuming a get confirmation that my S/R areas are being honored. I will look to the NQ for primary confirmation of trend. It is my belief that the NQ and the SP cannot trend separately; they move together. If they are not moving together, we are likely in a sideways day.

2. Is there sufficient range left in the direction of the trade to justify if? By this, I mean, is the trade going to run into an S/R line without going very far? If so, I need to avoid the trade.

I make it a personal rule to risk no more than 1/3rd the amount of money I expect to make on a trade. That means, if I expect to net 21 points on the trade, I will risk net 7 points on the trade.

I will move my stop-loss trigger to B/E when I am halfway to my first target, and will trail that distance until the first target is hit or the trailing stop is hit, whichever comes first. I will make sure that my trail is no less than one average 30 minute bar in width. Currently, the average 30 minute bar is just over 4 points, so a 5 point trail will be sufficient.

I will establish a time frame for the trade to ensure that I don’t just sit in it indefinitely. If my price exits are not hit, then I will take a time exit.",finance,1393726165

personalfinance,Explain it like I am 12- student loan balance discrepancy,"I consider myself to be an intelligent, educated woman. But student loans make me feel freaking stupid.

When I sign into the Student Aid.ed.gov website, it lists my current balance on my law school loans as $125k. Expensive, yes, but what I expected.

Yet when I contact my servicer, Fed Loan Servicing, the Dept of Ed's servicer for student loans (and all my loans are federal loans), my outstanding balance is $175k. 

This is a discrepancy of FIFTY THOUSAND bucks. 

Any insight or even similar experiences would be appreciated, I have written dispute letters to the Fed Loan servicer over the last six months and have not received an explanation. Is the Student Aid website reliable? I have always counted on it to keep a tally of my loans. My brain cannot process where my servicer has added $50k. Thanks.",finance,1393731415
personalfinance,Should I lower contributions to my 401k to pay off loans?,"I recently graduated and started working for a company that offers a 100% match on up to 8% of income for 401k contributions. So far I have been putting the full 8% in, which equates to about $400/mo. However, I have $7,200 in student loans (7.5% interest rate) that I would like to pay off. After bills and 401k contribution, I seem to only have around $400/mo to put towards the student loans. Should I lower my contribution to my 401k for about half a year until I pay this loan off?

Here are more details about my financial situation:

22, Male

Income: $61,000

Take-Home: $3,000/mo

Money in savings: $4,000

| Expense   | Cost    | Percent of Income     |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| Rent and utils        |     $1,175     |     39%     
| Car, gas, and ins  |    $500|  17%   
| Discretionary* | $400 | 13%
| Food       |        $325|   11%
| Phone | $90 | 3%
| Internet/TV | $50 | 2%
| Hair cut | $30 | 1%

* Discretionary covers out to eats, entertainment, and non recurring expenses.

That leaves $430 (14%) to put towards the loans. If I lowered my contributions, I could pay off the loan much quicker. Also, could I get some feedback as to my budgeting? Thanks!

My understanding is that you want rates on bonds to be low when you purchase so that eventually the interest rates will go back up, hence a higher return. Is this correct?

If so, I imagine you'd want to keep an eye on your bonds and look for an apex in said rates then look to sell?

dogecoin,Why we're not going to the moon,"Just kidding we are.

But the graph on [coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/doge_30.html) isn't.

Let us calculate what it would take to get the chart of coinmarketcap (at its current zoom level) on the moon:

Distance Earth - Moon: **380'000 km**    
Distance 0 - 100'000'000 market cap on the graph: **5.3 cm**    
Market cap per cm (graph): **18.9 million USD per cm**

So **380'000 km * 18.9 million USD/cm** gives us a market cap of **$717 quadrillion**, which is **582'927 times** the amount of USD in circulation (including Federal Reserve notes)

For a total DOGE supply of **100'000'000'000** that means **$7.17 million per DOGE**

If the total amount of DOGE in circulation is infinite, then that means we would achieve a **$1 = 1 DOGE** ratio (given a stable market cap at the moon) after **136.4 million years**

Join me next time when we calculate when to expect moon colonization powered by DogeCoin.

Bitcoin,Why hasn't Mt. Gox called for a criminal investigation? Because they are the criminals.,"This doesn't make any sense.  If a bank vault had been robbed of $500 million in gold or citibank had been hacked (office space style) and $500 million was missing, the first thing they would do is call the police and inform everyone and stop accepting deposits and halt regular business operations.

Mt. Gox has access to information (server logs, wallet addresses, etc..) that combined with with the power of law enforcement agencies, could lead to arrests and the recovery of some bitcoins.   I mean if a bunch of random people on reddit can piece together speculative blockchain info to sort of figure out what is going on, surely investigators with full access to all information and authority to issue subpoenas would be able to determine a better picture of what happened.

Lets get real, if the FBI can lure a bunch of Ukrainian peasants responsible for reselling stolen credit cards for a few thousands dollars into turkish prison, I'm sure they can help track down who stole $500 million.

Also, those saying that Mt. Gox is under a gag order,  When in the history of ever has ""teh feds"" used a ""gag order"" to put a multi-million dollar Japanese company out of business?

**Two Secret Service Raids Later, Previous Holder of Over $4m in BTC in Good Spirits**

One man's world has been inarguably changed, for the better, and the worse, by Bitcoin. Through a shrewd and, what some have claimed dubious, business deal, Nashville, TN resident Michael Brown (known online as “Knightmb”) acquired 371,000 Bitcoins (then worth roughly $20,000 in a market which couldn't bear downward pressure) for $5,000. As of this writing, the 371,000 Bitcoins he purchased in 2011 are currently worth approximately $4m. Now, however, he may not only be Satoshi-less, but may also (again) be at risk of a stay in federal prison.

Who Is Michael Brown?
Brown lives in TN with his wife and child, working in just about everything technical. He provides wireless Internet service, designs hardware for other his company and other Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) to use, as well as software. Brown also works as network, email, and website administer for multiple SMBs. Brown is quite familiar with Bitcoin and within the earlier online community. Around 2010, Brown even wrote and published an abstract on “Timekoin,” a proposed Bitcoin alternative he still uses. 

Brown's Bitcoins
Around the time of Bitcoin's birth, Brown collected money (the project had roughly $12,000 in total funding) and bought hashing power to accumulate Bitcoins. By the time the money had run out, the project owned approximately 371,000 Bitcoins. However, even while the price of Bitcoins were roughly $.06 each, there was only very weak market demand. According to Brown, “It is easy in hindsight to think of how foolish anyone would be to sell that large amount of bitcoins for such a small amount, but back then there were articles written all over the Internet about bitcoin being a pyramid scam or a fools investment. The people (investors) that originally got into it, thought they had made a huge investment mistake and just wanted to get out.” And get out they did, allowing Brown to buy the project and its 371,000 Bitcoins for “only” $5,000.

However, while this collection of Bitcoin would be worth roughly $4,000,000 USD as of this writing, Brown states he did give away most of his holdings, including a large chunk to Wikileaks when they began accepting BTC donations, with Brown adding the quip “At the time though, I might as well have been sending power points from pokemon cards as far as what actual value they would get from it.“ Brown also gave much of his holdings away to those finding his contact information, with the remainder being sold once the Bitcoin market skyrocketed, allowing him to “make back my initial investment plus a lot of interest.“

There have been claims of foul play by Brown's previous partners, who were primarily members of electric bicycle forum Endless-Sphere. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Justin, the current owner of the forum (Brown previously owned the forum while the Bitcoin accumulation project was ongoing). However, as of this writing, no evidence was brought up indicating Brown had done anything morally questionable. While there was “a three day mutiny” against Brown while he owned the forum, it appears this was solely related to the sale of the forum to another person (not Justin) who wanted the forum to be monetized.


Tax Document Theft
In mid-2012, Mitt and Ann Romney's tax documents were stolen from their accounting firm, PWC. Later, PWC received a flash drive and ransom letter demanding $1m worth of Bitcoins to keep the documents private. These documents, as of today, were never released, though it would appear the Romneys never paid the ransom. BitInstant, for their part in grabbing the media's attention in this ordeal, offered the Romney campaign a free USD-to-BTC conversion should they be interested.

The flash drive in the envelope sent to PWC did not just contain copies of the documents the ransomer was threatening to release, but also included two pictures of cats around furniture. The cat pictures were heavily scrutinized by the US Secret Service and considered to be the smoking gun of the case, which Brown says “has kind of turned into a running joke now among friends and family.” The Secret Service then decided, likely with evidence not yet presented to the public, to conduct a raid against Michael Brown and his family's home (again).

Likely taken into consideration by the United States SS was Brown's previous acquaintance with SS agents during their last raid of his house, which occurred in 2009. At the time, Brown worked for an insurance company to help them neatly organize customers' personal information into a spreadsheet. Brown alleges that part of the information he was to organize were social security numbers, which he wasn't sure if was legal. Brown contacted the insurance company but wasn't given proper attention until he threatened to tell national media. Brown says, “They explained that no one should have access to any customer's social security number, but I was trying to show them it was wrong assumption. Soon afterward, instead of fixing the issue, they called the federal government and told them I had stolen their customer data which contained tens or hundreds of thousands of social security numbers.“ It was at this point Brown first experiences the joy of a federal raid, where only his workstation was seized (he would not be so lucky in the future).  According to Brown, “After many months and many visits to the Secret Service office in Nashville, the case was finally closed for being a waste of time and resources for the Secret Service and my workstation was returned (damaged). No charges were ever filed and the case dropped.“

The 2012 Raid
It was September 14th, 2012 when Brown and his wife would again awake to bright flashlights being shone in their faces by Secret Service agents. This time, agents demanded answers about the pictures of cats written to the USB drive included with the ransom letter sent to the Romneys' tax firm.

Unfortunately for the Secret Service, they soon found neither the cats nor the furniture pictured. This didn't prevent them from further interrogating Brown and his family, however. His daughter would later be able to identify the cats as being owned by one of Brown's former clients, Janine Bolin, whose computer he backed up for her while helping repair her system. The Secret Service left Brown's house after crawling around his attic and confiscating any electronics they could find. They then paid a visit to Bolin's house, where they'd again confiscate all electronic equipment in case it might have evidence.

Brown states legal fees may be as high as $6,000, with other damages including what was done to his house (including the stereotypical broken doors), and says the situation the US Secret Service has created is similar to if “your local plumber has his entire truck taken, along with all the tools he uses for the trade.” Brown appears in good spirits, however, saying “if I ever do get any/all of my equipment back, I'm going to have a lot of extra of the same thing at least.” Brown ends responding to my questions with “Overall, the Federal government is made up of regular people like myself. The Federal government makes mistakes and bad things happen because of it. The most our family can do is pick up our life and move on. That is why we were reaching out for help. There have been many times when I've donated money or resources to help those in need, I guess it is time I ask the same in return of my fellow man.”

Brown has created a site for donations at www.mbdonationfund.com.",cryptocurrency,1393780589

Sorry for so much radio silence over the past several months, but we are back and we have big news. We've been busy doing a lot of grassroots outreach and we are excited to announce that activists from the Occupy Money Cooperative will be joining a coalition of Occupy organizers and educators known as FedUp from Strike Debt, the Public Banking Institute, the American Monetary Institute and more radically progressive organizations yet to be announced.

We are joining the FedUp coalition in order to help illuminate the corruption of the global centralized banking system and to help promote viable alternatives to the predatory banking system. The Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank are co-sponsoring The Eighth Annual International Conference on Monetary Policy. We will use education as direct action and occupy the Federal Reserve in Washington D.C. on March 21st and 22nd in order to hold the 1st International People's Conference on Monetary Policy in order to provide teach-ins and workshops about the global injustice of the centralized banking system as well as the solutions that our coalition has to offer.

We will stand in solidarity with FedUp and demand that Janet Yellen, the new Chair of the Federal Reserve and the rest of the conference attendees join our alternative conference so we can tell them ourselves how International Monetary Policy should be used to bail out Main St. instead of Wall St.

Check out the announcement here on Occupy.com and please join us in person or in the spirit of solidarity by clickingl RSVP for the event here on Facebook.

Sprouting New Digital-Economic Forms in Times of Crisis

International Conference, Bazaar, Workshops, Art &amp; Performances

March 21-22, 2014
Lab111
Arie Biemondstraat 111
Amsterdam

Program: networkcultures.org/moneylab/program-3/conference-sessions/

MoneyLab: Coining Alternatives is a two-day international conference on alternative economic forms and the future of money organized by the Institute of Network Cultures on 21-22 March 2014 at Lab 111 (Arie Biemondstraat 111) in Amsterdam.

The conference brings together top international speakers – researchers, activists, filmmakers, visual artists and performance artists, designers and programmers – to critically probe alternative economic models, payment systems, revenue models and local and digital currencies against the backdrop of the ongoing global economic stagnation.

Topics: Bitcoin | Crowdfunding | Mobile Money | Digital Currencies | Local Currencies | Economic Crisis &amp; Activism | Money and Art | Alternative Banking Systems | Monetization | Dismantling Global Finance | Alternative Economies

Speakers: Saskia Sassen, Bill Maurer, Franco Berardi, Tiziana Terranova, Eduard de Jong, Aaron Koenig, Brian Holmes, Matthew Slater, Lana Swartz, Beat Weber, Brett Scott, Dadara, Dette Glashouwer, Eli Gothill, Erin Taylor, Inge Ejbye Sørensen, Jamie King, Marijke Hoogenboom, Max Haiven, Quinn du Pont, Ron Peperkamp, Stefan &amp; Ralf Heidenreich, Stephen Musoke, Taylor Nelms 

Is crowd funding signalling an cultural shift in art production and artists’ relationships with their audiences. What lessons are to be learned from mobile money payment systems in Africa? What is the future of internet-based currencies like Bitcoin? What are the technical and economic criticisms of Bitcoin, and how can they be fed back into the currency or be used to create others? Is it possible to imagine a future sustainable alternative network-economy? Is an equivalent of money even needed, and what would a non-monetary economy look like? 

The MoneyLab Alternatives Bazaar complements the conference. The Bazaar presents organizations and initiatives directly involved with alternative revenue models and local currencies such as Qoin, Noppes, Next Nature &amp; Eco Currency, Timebank CC, Peerby, and a Bitcoin ATM. The Alternatives Bazaar provides a platform to network, exchange ideas, and get involved and is open throughout the 22nd of March. Further activities at the event include art performances, a film program, video art installations and workshops.

personalfinance,Question on making extra principal payments,"So i just got a decent tax return and i was thinking about throwing most, if not all, of it to the principal balance on my student loans. I know the best strategy is to pay off the loans with the highest interest rates. 

I have four loans accruing at 6.8% with various balances. Financially speaking, should i pay down the balances with the higher balances or work to completely pay off one of the smaller loans completely?",finance,1393797501
personalfinance,Paying down student loans vs. house down payment.,"So my situation is this. I am currently in grad school with ~$95k in debt and I expect that if I don't pay anything on my loans while in school I will be at ~$130k at the time of graduation. My salary when I graduate will be in the ballpark of $120-$140k a year, depending on a lot of factors, but $125-130k is most likely. My loans are federal unsubsidized and I'm averaging about 7% interest on them. 

My wife is employed making around $130-140k per year and she has no debts. Actually, our only debts between us are my student loans (cars are paid off, no credit card debt, and we currently rent). She is already maxing her 401K contributions.

We are going to want to buy a house shortly after I graduate and get a job as we currently live in an apartment. So, as I see it we have a couple options since she has disposable monies. 

1)We could save the cash and use that for a down payment on a house. We currently have about 10% of a down payment saved (counting a one time withdrawal of $10k each from our Roth IRAs for first time homebuyers). We *may* be able to get 20% saved up in that time frame, but maybe not. Houses in our area are likely to be somewhere between $400-600k.

2) We use that disposable income to pay down my student loans while I am in school. The interest is currently not compounding, but 7% interest is serious business. 

Is there a preferable option here? My main concern is the presence of mortgage insurance if we put less than 20% down, though some of our friends/colleagues have mentioned that with a lot of ""doctor loans"" there isn't mortgage insurance (my wife is a physician), but I've no idea if this is fact or not.

Bonus question: After I graduate, is it possible to take a private loan at a lower interest rate than current to consolidate my student loans? I'm not concerned about being able to pay them off, just more concerned with lowering my interest rates.

personalfinance,Very important Tax Return question,"So, long story short, I went to the IRS website and it's like ""Do ye want to file online?"" So I said ""Ye mate"" and the first website it suggested was 1040.com    

So, anyway, one of the questions asks ""CAN someone claim you as a dependent?"" and my father DOES 

But, when I got the finalized form, it has a question saying ""If someone can claim you (or your spouse if a joint return) as a dependent, check the applicable box(es) below and enter the amount from the worksheet on page 2.  

You [ ]      Spouse [ ] 

If no, put $10,000 &lt;------------ PROBLEM

They're both blank, yet, technically if I said ""Yeah my dad claims me"" the form is SUPPOSED to check me. ...........Right?

This is causing my Federal Returns to be $651 instead of $404. Because if we check the box saying ""You"" It'd be $6,100 on that line instead of $10,000.

The question: IS this website a giant douchebag or is it actually correct? I paid the website $20 for this shit and I don't want the IRS boning me for something that's not my fault.

personalfinance,"Auto loans, should I go to the dealer and let them find me a lender. Or should I contact lenders myself and go to a dealership with a check in hand?","Here's the situation: Yesterday me and my dad go to a dealership looking at 2012 TSX. Name brand dealer, Acura of Pleasanton. They were asking $23,000 for it. We short sold our home like 3 or 4 years ago, but other than that my pops makes over $80,000 a year and has consistently been paying his home rent and everything else. My dad for some reason told the sales person his credit might not be good so I think the sales person was using that to exploit us.

He goes in the back saying it'll take a couple minutes to run his credit, comes back like half an hour to 45 minutes later asking my dad to sign papers saying that they could not pull up our credit number due to lack of credit history or something. Then he goes back for another hour, which I'm thinking he's probably just BS'ing back there with his employees making us sweat and get anxious and desperate enough to where we'll consider ourselves lucky if we can get the car at all. 

He comes back saying with our credit payments will be above $600 a month! Also get this, he never ever says how many months the loan is, or at what interest rate, all the guy wants to talk about is per month, per month. We say hell no, we're leaving. He gets up and talks to his manager and comes back and he says oh a couple more lenders came through and it looks like we can lower the payments to $450 a month but that's it, that's pushing the budget they have to sell the car way far. At this time while he's convincing us ""is 4 to 5 dollars a day going to stop you from owning this car""?  And saying to take the big payments for a year and refinance with another lender when we get better credit to get the payments down. Then another salesman comes out and asks for the keys to the same car we were trying to buy. Saying he has customers wanting to look at it. He didn't even walk towards the car, and later we see that the car was in the same spot parked the same way we left it after we test drove it. Yet another move to get us anxious and willing to pay anything.

**ok here's the important stuff:**

They wanted us to pay $2,000 down, with 450 a month payments I'm assuming for 72 months (6yr) since there was no way they could have lowered the payments supposedly. That's $32,400 on a car that they were asking only $23,000 for. That's BEFORE downpayment of $2,000 making it a grand total of $34,400. What bank even with bad credit, which they never told us what our credit was, would charge a 66% interest rate? **Edit: These calculations are off**

Should we just go around to auto lenders ourselves and look for somebody to give us a straight answer as far as what a downpayment and interest will look like and cut us a check. Rather than go to a dealer and have them say what lenders will do for us without giving us any actual numbers to look at?",finance,1393804368
personalfinance,"24 years old, just graduated from university and have a job lined up. Can I afford to spend 24k on a car?","I have been driving around a 2004 nissan altima (190k miles on it) since I was 19 and I am looking to get a nice used car. The Altima maybe has another 10k or 20k miles in it, but it has seen better days. Thus I am on the market for a new car. 

I would like to purchase a 2011 nissan 370z touring edition (roughly 24k) with 40k miles on it. The condition is impeccable for the mileage. I know cars can be money sinks, but now that I actually have money it is tempting to blow it on a car. Would you advise a young man in my position to go through with the purchase or am I better off being more stingy with my money?

Here is my financial situation:

- 24 years old with a M.S. in geophysics. I was hired to work an exploration geology company to interpret seismic data. My current salary is 105,000/year (8750/mo) and I had a 12k signing bonus  with the company (must pay back if I don't stay for two years). The bonus is currently sitting in the bank, but I will apply it to my student loan debt to reduce it to 14000.

- I have 26000 in federal student loan debt from my undergrad degree in geology. I have no other financial obligations or consumer debt. I have a girlfriend but she supports herself. Not looking to start a family for the next 10 years or so. 

- I live in Houston so no state tax and I have a low cost of living. Here is my monthly budget:
1000/mo for a 2bdr loft downtown (roommate is a friend from college), 250/mo utilities, 250/mo for groceries, 400/mo for eating out/bar tabs, 300/mo for clothes, 60/mo for a cellphone, 400/mo spending money, 150/mo for gas, 300/mo for student loans. Thus my expenses are currently ~3100/month. I usually chuck 3000 into a savings account every month.

Bitcoin,FedCoin,"Warning: the following concerns Bitcoin qua currency, which I do not believe is a reasonable -- let alone optimal -- way to think about Bitcoin. Read at your own risk. Nonetheless, many commentators, some very intelligent, persist in conceptualizing Bitcoin as a currency without engaging with the aspects of the bitcoin protocol that transcend the traditional domain of monetary economics. For the sake of intellectual discourse, I am raising a discussion on the same wavelength, but I don't really think it's a rational way to think about bitcoin, or the future of monetary economics.

Phew. Warning aside, let's continue.

Say you wanted to start a ""legitimate"" cryptocurrency which included a role for a national central bank in conducting monetary policy. Certainly some among you will already consider this a contradiction. But this post is not addressed at you. How could one cryptographically guarantee that only a central banker with a constitutionally valid mandate from the government affiliated with the central bank in question, could influence the control of the money supply for the cryptocurrency in question?

My naive thought is that no existing constitution is even close to providing the necessary guarantees for this sort of cryptocurrency. If you disagree, I would like to know why, and please ELI5.

Stipulating, for the sake of argument, that no existing constitution provides the necessary cryptographic guarantees, I am curious to learn of any coherent explanations of how to integrate fiat money systems with the state-of-the-art in monetary systems. Given that people have cryptocurrency alternatives, what is the positive case for why, in say 5 years, fiat money systems will be able to compete effectively with alternatives based upon secure (as far as we know) cryptographic protocols? I consider ""boots on the ground"" -- i.e. realpolitik and the physical correlates of political power -- at best an incomplete explanation. 

Consider a case such as the U.S.A. I view the probability that the US controls its own money supply, has not defaulted, and remains the world's reserve currency, in the year 2020 as greater than 99%. But even granting these facts, in the face of rational expectations plus political uncertainty, I still see the persistent strength of the USD (relative to existing and potential alternatives) as a bit of an economic puzzle. One form of argument that I find troubling goes as follows. Suppose Bitcoin is a success, achieves broad adoption in the third world, etc etc.  Why wouldn't the US implement its own USDCoins, a cryptocurrency protocol backed by the full faith and credit of the You-Knighted-Staytes of Aymayrica?! I see a logical gap here: what, precisely, would define the value of such a cryptocurrency? 

Let's set aside the question of what's achievable by the existing political ecosystem. In a theoretical, ideal state of the world, what EXACTLY would a FedCoin mean? What guarantees would it hold? How would its value persist across regime changes in the US government? How, precisely, would it be protected from both debasement and ""macroeconomically destructive"" deflation? What about constitutional crises? 

With some positive probability, the advantages of cryptocurrencies cannot be ""undiscovered"". Even in my most intellectually charitable moods, I therefore have a hard time conceptualizing a coherent argument for _any_ conceivable putative ""FedCoin"" over Bitcoin. The point of this post is to expose myself to new lines of argument. Please explain why I am missing something.",cryptocurrency,1393817296

dogecoin,To all Shibes concerned about the value of Doge...,"""To the moon!"" is the rally cry around these parts of the interwebs. Well, some Shibes out there want to be on the moon as soon as Shibely possible and who doesn't?! Well, the D is only a few months which is like...twoish years in people terms. Perspective is needed.

It took Bitcoin about two years to go from nothing to almost $1,200 USD. 

It took two years for Windows Phone to actually be supported by people.

It took about a year and a half for health care reform to be passed in the US.

It's taking me two years for my order to be placed for my correct driver's side axle on my car.

Even better and even more relevant, it took NASA the better part of the 1960s to successfully land human beings on the moon. Almost a WHOLE TEN YEARS. Think about all the failures, blown up rockets, sacrificed lives, puke stains, successes, and floating monkeys it took for a small group of people to go to outer space and walk on the moon. 

Now think about our lonely fun little Dogecoin we have and how it's still such a cute little puppy and ALL the places it might go and can go and should go. It still needs to learn how to not take a dump or pee on the couch. It will get big and strong one day soon. How big that D will get? I don't know, no one really does. 

And to segway off into something else...

MtGox and the scandal around it. Basically, how I see it, it's a bank that collapsed and all the money it had is now gone forever and no one is there to repay this back. This type of thing happen in the 1930s during the Great Depression, banks collapsed and weren't able to give people their money. This is what happened afterwards: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, was formed by the FDR administration in 1933. All banks nowadays are insured by the FDIC (I sure hope your bank is!) meaning if they were to collapse, money is insured up to $250,000.

An idea I have is simple and would really help strengthen the cryptocurrency community in general, form a third party, non-partisan, open sourced insurance group that can insure people's losses from exchanges such as MtGox. Ideally, you shouldn't be keeping your coins on an exchange, but we all know how that goes. You have a certain amount like five BTCs that are to be used to exchange for Doge. But you forget or decide to keep your BTC as they are. Exchange collapses. Coins are gone. Poop. :( 

If that exchange is listed as an insured exchange, you're safe! :) 

Luckily, the Doge community has done such a thing already like the Save Dogemas campaign. Let's expand that out a bit further. Let's form a crypto FDIC of sorts and show the crypto community at large that not only have we pulled off a pretty popular coin, we've made it an actual currency and one that has insured exchanges. Aw yeah!

International Conference, Bazaar, Workshops, Art &amp; Performances
March 21-22, 2014 Lab111 Arie Biemondstraat 111 Amsterdam

Program: networkcultures.org/moneylab/program-3/conference-sessions/

MoneyLab: Coining Alternatives is a two-day international conference on alternative economic forms and the future of money organized by the Institute of Network Cultures on 21-22 March 2014 at Lab 111 (Arie Biemondstraat 111) in Amsterdam.

The conference brings together top international speakers – researchers, activists, filmmakers, visual artists and performance artists, designers and programmers – to critically probe alternative economic models, payment systems, revenue models and local and digital currencies against the backdrop of the ongoing global economic stagnation.
Topics: Bitcoin | Crowdfunding | Mobile Money | Digital Currencies | Local Currencies | Economic Crisis &amp; Activism | Money and Art | Alternative Banking Systems | Monetization | Dismantling Global Finance | Alternative Economies
Speakers: Saskia Sassen, Bill Maurer, Franco Berardi, Tiziana Terranova, Eduard de Jong, Aaron Koenig, Brian Holmes, Matthew Slater, Lana Swartz, Beat Weber, Brett Scott, Dadara, Dette Glashouwer, Eli Gothill, Erin Taylor, Inge Ejbye Sørensen, Jamie King, Marijke Hoogenboom, Max Haiven, Quinn du Pont, Ron Peperkamp, Stefan &amp; Ralf Heidenreich, Stephen Musoke, Taylor Nelms

Is crowd funding signalling an cultural shift in art production and artists’ relationships with their audiences. What lessons are to be learned from mobile money payment systems in Africa? What is the future of internet-based currencies like Bitcoin? What are the technical and economic criticisms of Bitcoin, and how can they be fed back into the currency or be used to create others? Is it possible to imagine a future sustainable alternative network-economy? Is an equivalent of money even needed, and what would a non-monetary economy look like?
The MoneyLab Alternatives Bazaar complements the conference. The Bazaar presents organizations and initiatives directly involved with alternative revenue models and local currencies such as Qoin, Noppes, Next Nature &amp; Eco Currency, Timebank CC, Peerby, and a Bitcoin ATM. The Alternatives Bazaar provides a platform to network, exchange ideas, and get involved and is open throughout the 22nd of March. Further activities at the event include art performances, a film program, video art installations and workshops.

personalfinance,I Have an Idea for Private Student Loans,"but I'm no financier, so I have no idea if this could even work in real life. Rolling Jubilee is great, but they don't touch student loans. Forgiveness programs are wonderful, but they only exist for federal loans. There are companies who use crowdsourcing to buy student loans, but they still require 6-10% interest. 

Here's my idea. Donors and hopefuls pour money into an account that is used to completely pay off student loan debt. The relieved debtor still pays he/her original loan amount back to this account, but he/she doesn't pay any interest. I'm thinking the debtor could opt to either keep the payments the same and shorten the life of the loan significantly, or keep the original length, but lower payments as a result of no interest. This way money is still going back into the account to pay off more loans and the debtor isn't stuck paying Citi Group an extra 130k for a 50k education.

Is there any way to set this up so it could help a lot of people very quickly? Thoughts?

So if you have an alt-coin I would advice to hold on to it because these whales are really trying to drive prices down.

## ELI5: Taxable Income, Tax Brackets, Marginal Tax Rates

The biggest point of confusion for a tax novice is how the tax brackets affect their tax burden.  Your marginal tax rate and your effective tax rate are not the same thing.  Moving into a higher marginal tax bracket does not mean your entire income is taxed at that rate.

The marginal tax brackets for 2013 are listed [here](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/2013-tax-brackets) ([2014](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/2014-tax-brackets)).  I will use the single filing brackets for illustrative purposes (I also didn't include deductions for this initial example).

Say you're a single filer that has $34,000 in taxable income (taxable income is explained more in-depth later).  Your boss calls you in and tells you that you're getting a raise to $40,000 per year!  Great!  But... how does this affect your taxes?  At $34k you're just under the cutoff for the 25% tax bracket, and now your marginal tax rate is 25% after the raise.  Are you really ""making"" more money, but losing virtually all of it to the increased tax burden?

No.  Since the tax brackets are marginal, based on the marginal tax rate (the tax rate at which *the next dollar* you earn is taxed), only the amount *above* the 25% bracket threshold ($36,901) is taxed at 25%.  Your tax calculation looks like this:

* $8,925 at 10% = $892.50  ($8,925 in taxable income)

* $27,325 at 15% = $4098.75 ($36,250 - $8,925 in taxable income)

* $3,750 at 25% = $937.50 ($40,000 - $36,250 in taxable income)

* **Total tax = $5,928.75**, effective federal rate = 14.8%

The marginal tax rates only apply to *taxable income* - that is, your income after all of your deductions and exemptions are factored into your total income.  Your total income is listed in line 22 of the 1040 form, while your taxable income is listed in line 43 of the 1040.  

## Deductions: Standard, Itemized, above the line - WTF?

Everyone is entitled to deduct certain things from their taxes.  Deductions reduce the amount of income that is subject to tax - they reduce your taxable income.  Deductions fall into three major categories: the standard deduction, itemized deductions, and ""above the line"" deductions.

* The **standard deduction** in 2013 is $6,100 for single filers in tax year 2013 ($6,200 for 2014).  If you claim the standard deduction, this is what you'd put in line 40 of Form 1040.

* If you want to claim **itemized deductions**, of which a number of expenses qualify, you need to include Schedule A with your tax filing.  The total of your itemized deductions goes in line 40 of the 1040 form.  The major itemized deductions are for home mortgage interest, state/local/property taxes, and charitable donations.  

* **""Above the line"" deductions** are listed in lines 23-35 of the 1040.  Most require additional documentation to show eligibility.  In /r/personalfinance the most popular tend to be the student loan interest deduction (line 33) and the IRA deduction (line 32).

One of the most common tax questions we get here is ""Should I itemize my deductions or just take the standard deduction?""  **If the sum of your itemized deductions is not larger than the standard deduction, you're almost always better off claiming the standard deduction.**

Now let's go back to our simple example from before.  Taking into account the standard deduction and one personal exemption for a single filer, the tax calculation changes significantly for the better:

* $6,100 + $3,900 = $10,000 subtracted from your taxable income.

* $8,925 at 10% = $892.50  ($8,925 in taxable income)

* $21,075 at 15% = $3,161.25 ($30,000 - $8,925 in taxable income)

* **Total tax = $4,053.75**, effective federal rate = 10.1%

Notice that the standard deduction and personal exemption put you in the 15% marginal tax bracket instead of the 25% bracket.

Your state may offer its own tax deductions for state taxes.  Details vary by state, but one of the most valuable is the deduction for 529 plan contributions if your state offers it.  

## Exemptions

In addition to deductions, most taxpayers are entitled to claim one or more tax exemptions.  Exemptions, like deductions, reduce your taxable income.  The personal exemption is $3,900 for 2013 ($3,950 for 2014).  If you are married filing jointly you can claim an additional exemption for your spouse.  You can also claim an additional exemption for each dependent.

High income individuals and couples may run into the phaseout thresholds for the exemption(s) they claim.  For more, see [IRS Publication 17](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch03.html).

## Tax Withholding

Your employer is required to withhold taxes from each of your paychecks by law.  The formula for withholding can be found in [IRS publication 15](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf).  You can adjust your withholding by giving a new/modified W-4 form to your employer.  The W-4 allows you to specify the number of allowances or extra withholding from your paycheck.

The IRS also provides a somewhat useful [withholding calculator](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator) that can help you determine if you are withholding too much or too little from your paychecks.  The calculator is good if you have a regular salary that doesn't change much throughout the year.

## Tax ""refunds"" - Not Ideal

Your tax filing calculates your actual tax obligation to what you've had withheld throughout the year.  If you underwithhold, you will owe the IRS the difference.  Beware that if you purposely underwithhold too much, [you may face a penalty](http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306.html).

If your tax obligation is *less* than what you've had withheld throughout the year, the difference is returned to you as a ""tax refund.""  While it may seem counterintuitive, tax refunds are not a good thing.  ""Refund"" implies that you actually owed the money you paid at some point - this is not the case.  Money that you never owed was being held by the government at 0% interest.  Instead of working for you throughout the year by paying down debt or funding your retirement accounts, your money was effectively doing nothing for anyone.  Aiming for as small a refund as possible, or even owing a small amount, is highly advisable.  You can do so by adjusting your allowances on your W-4.

## Tax Credits

Tax credits directly reduce your tax burden by effectively giving you a refund.  There are [dozens](http://www.efile.com/tax-credit/federal-tax-credits/) of tax credits in the tax code.  Some of the more common, subject to eligibility, are the child care credit, foreign tax credit, American Opportunity tax credit, and Lifetime learning tax credit.  Your state may offer tax credits as well.

## Capital Gains and Capital Losses

Another common point of confusion is the capital gains tax rules.  Due to the character limit, I will direct you to [this page](http://taxes.about.com/od/capitalgains/a/CapitalGainsTax.htm) from About.com which explains things very well.

You cannot claim unlimited tax-free long term capital gains in the 15% tax bracket - only the amount required to ""fill up"" the 15% bracket is exempt from tax.  Any long-term capital gains past that would be taxed at the 15% rate.

## Other Taxes

Several other taxes you will or may be responsible for paying, and will see withheld from your paycheck:

* State/local taxes - rates vary by state and locality.

* Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance - 6.20% up to $113,000 in taxable income in 2013, 6.20% up to $117,000 in taxable income in 2014.  

* Medicare - 1.45% on your entire taxable income.  If you are a high earner you may have to pay an additional 0.9%.

# Frequently Asked Questions about Taxes

**Should I see someone about my taxes?**

Even if you're itemizing your deductions, the majority of people that ask this question in /r/personalfinance are likely capable of filing their taxes themselves.  Tax situations that may merit seeing a professional would be a small business, multiple state residencies/income, or overseas tax issues (foreign tax credit, foreign earned income exclusion).  Tax preparation costs vary based on complexity and where you live, but most tax returns can be prepared by a professional for a few hundred dollars. 

**What tax software should I use?**

[TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/) and [TaxACT](http://www.taxact.com/index.asp) are the two most popular commercial suites.  If your income is below $58,000 you can file your federal return for free directly with the IRS using [freefile](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free).  Costs of state returns through the Turbotax and TaxACT cost $36.99 and $17.99, respectively.  Both suites charge more for things like capital gains, rental income, etc.

**I already filed my taxes.  Can I still contribute to a Roth IRA?**

Yes.  Unless you're eligible for the [saver's credit](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Get-Credit-for-Your-Retirement-Savings-Contributions) then your Roth contribution after you file your return but before the April 15 deadline will not affect your tax filing.  Roth contributions are post-tax.

**Why doesn't the student loan interest deduction double for couples married filing jointly?**

That's just the way the tax code was written.  The maximum you can deduct in student loan interest is $2,500 regardless of your filing status.

**What's the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit?**

*Tax deductions* reduce the amount of your income that is taxed, while *tax credits* reduce your tax burden directly.  The amount your tax burden is reduced by a deduction is the amount of the deduction times your marginal tax rate.  For example, a tax deduction of $1,000 for someone in the 25% tax bracket will save $250 on their overall tax burden.  A tax credit of $1,000 will save $1,000 on their overall tax burden.

**I screwed up a tax return for a previous tax year.  What should I do?**

You need to file an amended return, form 1040X.  The IRS provides [this](http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc308.html) guidance for filing amended returns.  As the IRS notes, your state tax obligation may change based on your federal tax obligation.  You may need to file an amended state return as well.

Last year over 60,000 people were here for the various conferences; mostly smaller/independent artists, labels and film-makers, as well as the people higher up in the different industries who make the big decisions.

Since so many of these people can hugely benefit from dogecoin, I wanted to get the word out as much as I can. I saw that someone will have a doge-ATM there, which is great but, that's pretty stationary and I think we can do more. Below, I've listed a few ideas I've had for reaching people and getting some publicity (there were over 3000 registered media-attendees last year, just for the music conference).
 
* Flyers - $150+ - Simple printed flyers with info about doge/cryptocurrency and links/qr codes to info, to be posted around town and handed out to the public.
* Street Teams to hand out info - $600 - It would be great if we could get a few people who are actually into doge and crypto to hand out info and possibly wallets/redemption-codes but, at the least we could hire a few people to do it over the biggest days of the conference.
* Preprinted Cards with Info for Artists/Labels and Public with redeem-codes to be sent doge - $100 &amp; $500+ Pool - These would be more specifically to hand out to artists, label reps, industry people; etc. Having examples relevent to their interests will help, as will putting one-time use codes to be sent $5-10 in doge. I figure that, if it's made clear that this is real money and not just a coupon or something like that, then that is an amount that most people will at least look into getting. By putting redemption codes instead of using pre-loaded wallets, we avoid the loss of doge for anyone who DOESN'T look further into it and tosses the card.
* Sponsor a Local Music and Event-Listing Site - $2000 - Sonicvaultaustin.com is a popular site for upcoming shows in Austin and, during the week of SXSW, they get over 10k hits a day from people looking for info about what is going on. By sponsoring the site, we can get dogecoin seen by a ton of people, as well as tell them where to find the ATM, more info, etc. Full Disclosure: this is a client of mine.
* Interactive Displays - In the past I've worked on and built interactive displays for different media-events; things like grand-openings, basketball games, etc. Based on some of the things I've done previously, I had a few ideas for displays (large and small) to draw people in a little more:
* * Rotating pages showing info about doge, live-updates of doge and users contributing to the pools supplying doge for all of this, upcoming shows nearby, and simple games that can be played via SMS to win doge
* * A scavenger hunt where each small display gives a clue for the next, with increasing amounts of doge for checking in at each progressing station and a grand-prize for either the first person to complete all of them or a randomly chosen winner from all of the people who do. This can also be accomplished with paper flyers but, honestly, there are so many, all over the place, that they may get covered pretty quickly
* * Use the webcams from the small displays to generate live-streams of people interacting with them and the conference-at-large
* * The small displays could possibly be put inside of venues, if we can raise enough to also buy advertising space
* * Street teams could be posted near the displays, either in addition to or in place of the Street Teams listed above
* * Multiple Small Interactive Displays - $3500 &amp; Display Pool
* * Large Stationary Interactive Display - $3000 &amp; Display Pool
* Air-Drop Doge - $600 &amp; Pool + plush shibas - This is probably the most unorthodox idea on the list but, I think that it would be really awesome to use a quadrocopter to drop stuffed Shiba Inus with pre-printed wallets (or redemption codes) onto the crowd on the streets. This would mostly be for the publicity, since it's a more expensive cost per interaction (figure about 50 stuffed dogs + a pool of doge for the wallets/redemption codes + hiring a quadrocopter pilot) but, if someone were to ""win"" a few hundred - thousand dollars, that might help the word spread.

In the above, I mentioned ""pools"" a few times so, just to be clear, what I mean by that is that there would be multiple pools containing doge to support these ideas:

* One pool for doge specifically for artists/labels as mentioned in the 3rd point above
* One pool for doge for people interacting with the displays, playing games, etc.
* One pool for doge to be dropped from a quadrocopter

I'll be out during the festival seeing as many shows as I can and, I intend on telling as many artists as I can about things so, I have no problem with posting flyers, handing out info, etc. To do any more than that, it would definitely take a community effort, since I don't personally have the doge or dollars to put into the really cool things I'd like to do. Each price listed above is an estimate for the individual item so, to do everything listed, it would take about $15,000 or 14.5 million Doge but, we could pick a few items and focus on those for less. 

It would be great if we could get a doge-related company to invest and sponsor things but, I didn't get much response when I reached out last week so, I figured I would go ahead and see if there might be enough community-interest to get some of this off of the ground over the next week. Since I realize that this is a pretty big sum of money, if people want to do everything, I'm more than happy to use mitm.io for escrow to hold funds.

I'll go ahead and transfer all of the tips from the thread so far, to there so that everyone can track things.

**EDIT 2: I just transferred the 7270 doge from this thread, as well as 900 I found in my tipbot account, bringing the current total to 30,680 doge + $300**

**EDIT 3: /u/MysticFear asked the very pertinent question of who am I? While I don't have any personal information on my site (having my name and picture pop up on one of those scam ""Busted!"" sites was the last straw), my name is Ruben Ramirez and you can view my business site [here](http://redlotusaustin.com). The whois info will verify my name and anyone who likes can email me at: ruben [@] redlotusaustin.com. I also don't mind providing more info to a mod or trusted user.**

**EDIT 4: HOLY CRAP! /u/aari13 sent 100,000 doge last night!! That brings us to ~132k doge!**

While I would really like to do the quadrocopter idea, I think it's best to shelve it for now, unless someone wants to specifically fund all of that. 

Dropping that from the list, we come out to about $11,000 total, which I think is absolutely do-able!

**EDIT 5: Does anyone have the contact info for the person who will have a doge-ATM at SXSW? I think it would make sense to have a display near that, helping everyone out.**",cryptocurrency,1393868669

Bitcoin,I posted this on FB as my response to all my friends sending my negative articles on BTC.,"A few of my friends have been sending me articles on bitcoin that have a “anti-bitcoin” slant to them. Rather than addressing the same issue separately and repeatedly, i’d like to address them here in one go.

The major theme of all these articles is that bitcoin will crash and be worthless, or it is already worthless. Fine. I agree. That’s right, you heard me! Get out of bitcoin now! So, then why am I in it?

What my anti-bitcoin friends don’t understand is WHY bitcoin has piqued my interest (hint: its not about making money). Bitcoin is much greater than just trading, mining, and making money. Its about changing the accepted and old ways of doing things. The changes happening with digital currency remind of me other exciting and world changing events that I and many of us have experienced. 

For me personally events such as: Going to Penn State on the weekends from Pittsburgh when I was 14 to attend nerdy Apple meetings and exchanging floppies full of games, programs, etc; or dialing into a BBS using a 300baud modem; or connecting my computer to friend’s computer in 1986 and doing text chatting (we only did that once as it was REALLY slow); or in 1989 getting fiber-optic connection in each and every dorm room so we can have this thing called the Internet(all text based back then). We knew something big was happening. This is the case with not just with bitcoin, but with the whole idea of crypto currencies. 

You see, what bitcoin (and any other crypto currency) is doing is making us rethink money as something digital - such as letters became email, pictures on film became jpg or gifs, music became mp3, movies became mp4 and avi. Even if bitcoin itself dies today, it will have paved the way for digital currency. I’m sure the fed is tired of printing and printing. I see the US Federal Reserve adopting a bitcoin type protocol for the US dollar and getting rid of paper money altogether. We will still have the dollar, but it won’t be on paper anymore - it will be digital. 

The Bitcoin protocol is also much more than just about money. Its a system to keep track of stuff/info securely and publicly. Its being used for DNS registration and someday will be used for keeping track and registering of titles/deeds on real estate and god knows what else.

Remember, there was a time when people laughed at paper money too (Tang Dynasty in the 7th century). The norm was to carry around coins of gold and silver. The next generation will ALSO be laughing at paper money, but for a different reason as money will have become digital.",cryptocurrency,1393879393

1. Have 4 different credit cards. Total debt ~$,6000 (some are at 0)

2. Today I asked my CC with the lowest interest rate (12.9%) to change over from a Airmiles rewards to a CashBack plan. I pay an annual fee of $75 and get 1.2% back on every purchase.

3. When the new card arrives, I am going to pay off my debts from all the other cards at once - then cut up all my extra cards. I think this makes sense because they all have much higher interest rates. I also shouldnt have so many cards. It's getting complicated. 

4. I am a filmmaker. And self employed marketing consultant. Hoping to be making cash soon. But useful to have a company credit card for expenses. Should I maybe keep a second card as a company credit card? Makes taxes easier at the end of the year, next time.

bonus: I never use my airmiles, reward miles, all the junk and bullshit they give me. Should I just go online shopping one day and cut my losses, get a cool new gizmo. Or is there a more practical thing to do with all my points?

personalfinance,Trying to save up for a wedding while paying off debt; very little savings; not sure what I'm doing.,"I’m here to ask for advice on how to most wisely pay down my debt while saving for a wedding. I’m a 24 year old graphic designer living in medium-sized US city, if that matters.


**GOALS**


My boyfriend and I are trying to save up for a wedding &amp; honeymoon, hoping to pay for it entirely upfront. We have been advised to save at least $10,000, preferably $15,000, which sounds outrageous to me but that’s the advice we’ve been given. We hope to get married in 2.5 years. I would also like to have all my debt paid off before we get married. 




**DEBT**


I just financed the purchase of a $2,800 computer. I know it’s bad to finance a purchase like that, but unfortunately I needed it immediately for work and waiting to save up the cash would have cost me an important career opportunity. I have 18 months to pay off the computer at 0% APR.


Aside from that, I have $9,000 distributed between 5 student loans with interest rates that range from 3.5% to 6.5%. I’ve been paying $600/mo on those for the last 3 years, but I just decreased that to $400 so I could try to pay off the computer (minimum payment on the loans is $230).




**RESOURCES**


I make $2,300 / mo. after taxes at my full-time job. I do freelance work as well which brings in extra money, but the amount I make from that each month varies wildly between nothing and $1,000+ (after putting 40% away for taxes). I pay about $1,000 in utilities per month (incl. rent, electricity, car insurance, basic pet supplies, cell phone, food), leaving me with roughly $1,300 to spend on loans, transportation, savings, and personal spending. I also just got a $1,100 tax return. 


I have $1,000 in personal savings, and my boyfriend and I have $400 in joint savings. I also have an IRA set up.




**MY QUESTIONS**


My plan was to use my tax return to cut this computer loan down, and then try to get that paid off as soon as possible. That way I can remove the possibility of missing a payment and getting slammed with 22% APR (I don’t plan to miss a payment but I hate that the possibility exists).


But now I’m thinking maybe I should just take 17 months to carefully pay off the computer, since it has 0% APR, and continue aggressively paying down my loans, since they are actively acquiring interest? 


And savings… I feel bad putting money aside for personal savings when I’m $11,800 in the hole. And in order to clear my debt and save for this wedding, I need to be putting aside at least $250 in joint savings and paying $400 toward my debts every month to get all that saved / paid off in 2.5 years. So that leaves me with $650 / mo for… everything else. What is the wisest way to use that money?",finance,1393884923

personalfinance,"In my 30's, married, with a baby on the way, with $150,000 in Student Loan Debt - Bring me back off of the ledge!","My story of debt accumulation started way back in 2003 when I went to school for a liberal arts degree.  It was an out-of-state state school (paid the list price, Strike 1) and upon graduation took a job with a non-profit making around $28,000/yr (Strike 2).  Total debt accumulation for the degree: $50,000 (Strike 3).

I met a great woman who was earning a bachelor's degree in a social science field (foul ball?) and we started dating.  She graduated and began her education to get her master's degree in the same field.  She graduated and took a job and is currently making $49,000 (New batter, Strike 1).  Total debt for her undergrad and graduate programs:  $50000 (Strike 2).

When she graduated, I was making $31,000 at my non-profit job and we both knew that if we wanted to retire before we were dead one of us would have to make more money.  After discussing it we made the decision that I would go back to school, full-time, to earn an engineering degree.  (Engineering was always an interest, just never went for it.)  We considered it to be a financial investment for the future (I sure as hell hoped anyways.)

So, I began a second 4-year bachelor's degree in engineering and incurred a debt of close to $50,000 (Strike 3... again).  I will be graduating in May and have a job lined up which will pay a starting salary of $64,250 with a potential $2000 bonus based on performance.  In terms of life-time earning potential, this job/sector blows my previous job/sector out of the water.  The average salary for a mid-career employee in my field is $110,000.  I'm pretty happy with the fact that I'll be making more than double what I would have been making had I stayed in the same field, however we are now faced with the daunting task of paying this debt off.

With all of that said, we are now expecting our first child in 7 months time.  We've been living relatively frugally up until now, however I feel that we may be living like hermits in the future to make ends meet.  My wife and I sat down last night and looked at our current budget and tweaked a lot of things to get a better handle on paying down our non-educational debt so when the payments come for my loans we have more available cash to pay them with.  Minus our car payment (we are a one car family at this point and plan on buying a VERY cheap car with cash for me to take to work) we have about $9000 in CC/medical/dental debt.  I know that we will be able to pay that debt off by December, which is when my loans will enter (or re-enter) repayment status.

In terms of how we're repaying our non-educational debt:  I have us shooting for knocking down the smallest item first, then rolling that money into the next biggest, and so on.  From a financial standpoint I know that we should be attacking our highest interest rates first, but she and I are both ""results"" driven people and we need to see progress to stay focused.  Yesterday we checked off two of our debts and felt really good about it, which will help us to check off the next, and so on.

I am curious if any of you have suggestions on how we should proceed?  Budgeting advice, repayment advice, lifestyle advice?  Have you been in a similar situation and if so what did you do to get yourself out of it?

I'm a 22 year old college senior graduating in May with a BS in Biology, and my knowledge of finance is pretty limited at this point (I've been lurking and learning, though). 

**Details regarding my situation:**  
1. No income (currently looking for a job, haven't been able to work due to my level of involvement and the fact that I play a sport)  
2. $0 cc debt (with no credit history)  
3. $0 in savings (parents tried to invest what I had and failed.. ha)  
4. $29,500 in student loan debt (mostly federal direct unsubsidized loans, including accrued interest to date; average interest rate is 5.7%).   
5. In 2005, my grandma passed away and left me 1,500 shares of Ameren Corp. (regional utility provider). At the time she passed away, the stock was near its all time high and worth about $51/share (~$76,500 total). Since 2005, the stock's value has dropped into the high teens but rebounded to $40/share (~$60,000 total) in today's market.  
6. Dividends are about $2,400/year before tax which I had hoped to throw into savings but I've had to use for living expenses.  

**My questions:**  
1. Should I sell some/all of my stock inheritance?  
2. If I sold, would I need to pay capital gains tax because a) I'd be selling at a loss from the time I inherited it (from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong!), and b) I'm in the currently in the 10% tax bracket.  
3. If I sold, would I have to do it before April 15, 2014, as to avoid potentially having to pay capital gains tax, under the assumptions that a) I will get a job within a year of graduating, and b) I could potentially be in the 25% tax bracket.  
4. If I sold all of the stock and used half of it pay off my student loans now, what should I do with the rest of it? I still need to do more research regarding investment/retirement options, so should I just throw the other half into a savings account and consider it my emergency fund until I decide?  

My biggest financial goals right now are to pay off my student loans and to save enough in the next year or two to relocate from the midwest to the west coast where there are a lot more job opportunities in biotech. Upon graduating, I plan on living at home with my parents to save as much money as I can. Advise me, please! I just need to be pointed in the right direction so I can figure out what I need to focus on learning because at this point, I feel in over my head!

I added my girlfriend to my healthcare plan from work as a domestic partner starting this year. I was informed by my HR it would become no longer exempt from federal taxes. I was checking my past pay stub and under earning were two new lines, one for dental and one for medical. Now, if my understanding of what is going on is correct, this is so that it would be taxed, since under deductions, the same amount is deducted. 

My question is, at the end if the year, will this addition to my earnings be part of my ""wages"" on my W2, even thought it gets deducted?

personalfinance,tax shelters?,"My wife and I are saving to buy a house in the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2014. Because of the timing of the purchase, I find it unlikely that the mortgage interest deduction or property taxes would justify itemizing this year. Can you help me come up with some ideas to reduce our tax liability? Because we are trying to get to 20% down without dipping into our emergency fund, we are hesitant to increase our IRA contributions much beyond the 10% that we already contribute. 

Combined gross income: $170k
Home purchase price target $350k ($280k financed)
Local taxes probably $3,500/year
Expected interest rate 4.3%
401k/457b contributions 10% of gross (speaking which, could contribute $17,500 each or total?)
Emergency fund $20k (cash and equities)

I believe mortgage points are tax deductible for the primary residence but I am not sure how long we would be in the house. Would 6 years be enough to justify paying points for a lower rate? So if we end up buying the house in August and having 5 months of $1k interest and $1.5k in taxes, I'd still need $6k of other deductible expenses to justify itemization. 

The only other expense that I may have been able to deduct is my student loan interest, but I think we will be above the phase out this year.

Am I overlooking anything?

personalfinance,How would I make the best out of the worst decision I've ever made? (Buying a horribly financed car) (xpost-FinancialAdvice),"Okay, I know I made a horrible decision. I was in a 25 yr old car that was at the end of its life (misfiring, had no reverse, wouldn't go above 30mph, etcetc). I had nothing in savings, I'd been turned down by every bank I'd gone to, I'd been laughed out of dealerships, I finally came across one that was able to find a place that would finance me. I was terrifed and relieved.

I bought (cry) a 2003 BMW 325xi with a sport package and 16 speakers. I didn't really care about all of that, but it was a bonus. The sticker says $12k! They tell me $300 a month, I can handle that! Its better than nothing, and on the up-side its a pretty sweet ride!

I can't afford this car. In the process of all the paperwork, nervousness, relief, talking to the bank and insurance, my payments go from $300 to $455 a month. I was scared. Felt like it was too late to back out. Felt I didn't have another option. I was stupid. 

What can I do now? I'm only 1 payment in on a $7k car that cost $12k, but I'll actually be paying ~$23k for because I have such poor credit that they stuck me with 28% APR. 

I've gone to my credit union and my bank and they both told me I owe too much to refinance without paying a sizeable chunk out of pocket. 

I really just want my 88 Accord with 350k miles on it back, even if I have to get out and push to back out of parking spaces, or avoid highways because of lack of speed. :(

Edit: To add to this, my insurance quoted me $97/month for full coverage, now I'm paying $130/month just a month and a half later. Gas mileage is worse than I'd looked up, 19mpg in the city. I knew parts would be pricier but oh man. 

Whats the worst that would come of handing it over to the bank?

I just transferred to a new school, after scholarships and money I put up I had to take out loans and I received a direct loan of 12.5k. 5k was subsidized and 7k wasn't. I used ~9K and told the school to manage my funds and return the excess, I asked if they needed written notice and they said no, turns out  I DID have to give them a written notice. Long story short, I received a check for about 3K. I'm still within the 120 day disbursement period, so I can just deposit the check and make the payment. 

My 401k gave me really good returns last year, way more then 3.85% (interest rate of un-subsidized loan). I am considering dumping that 3k into a mutual fund with Vanguard or Fidelity (my current 401k provider) and lock it up for 2 years (date of graduation), I'm hopeful that I'd accrue more than the 3.85% in two years (I got 30% return last year) so when I graduate I could repay back the orignal 3K and whatever returns I gained. I know this is a risk but if I get even a modest 8% return for the two years, it's still more than the 3.85% original loan interest.

At my income level (~90k per year, excellent credit), I could probably get a 15 year mortgage, but I wouldn't be saving much after that.

I am wondering what the cost would be associated with this decision.

Essentially, what would be the difference in TOTAL COST of the two following scenarios?

* Option 1: Signing for a 30 year mortgage, but paying it off in 15 years.
* Option 2: Signing for a 15 year mortgage and paying it off in 15 years.

personalfinance,FICO Scoring 101: Behind the Numbers,"Simply put, a credit score is a firm's numerical assessment that quantifies the question: *What kind of risk am I taking on this person?* With credit scores becoming one of the cornerstones of pre-employment screening and apartment leases, it's important to discern from fact and rumor when it comes to managing your score.

The [traditional credit score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AtM1R9NmwM) is calculated using an algorithm from Fair, Isaac, and Company, or FICO for short. The algorithm takes information from one of the three credit bureaus that gather information on your payment history: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax. A computer generates a number based on one of your reports, and spits out your credit score. This number can range from 850 (perfect credit) all the way down to 350 (perfectly terrible credit).

However, there are several different *""flavors""* of credit scores. FICO has tuned their algorithm to give out a mortgage score, an auto score, a bankcard score, and so on and so forth. Even more: your score in any of these categories will be different depending on which bureau originated it. Your TransUnion score will be different from your Experian score, for example. But no matter where it comes from, every score is based on the health of five different factors:

**Your payment history is 35% of your FICO score.**

Naturally, the biggest indicator of whether someone will pay their bill on time is how well they've done so in the past. Some of the best credit scores have an extremely long history of on-time payments. This means that missed payments, delinquencies, collections accounts, judgements, and other derogatory marks will affect your score negatively. While they hurt your score, though, they do not do so permanently. Bad marks fall off at the 7 year mark.

Unfortunately, paying utilities, rent, and other bills don't contribute to your score. These accounts do not count as *tradelines*, or lines of credit, so FICO doesn't consider them. However, if they get passed on to a collections agency, they *will* affect your score negatively.

So if there is one thing to know about this category, it's to always pay your bills on time. Ideally, especially for your credit cards, *you will want to pay all of your statement balances in full every month to avoid paying interest.*

**Special note:** An interesting fact about the FICO algorithm is that you need six months of history to even register a score. Applicants with ""thin files"" will actually have no score associated with them.

**Your amounts owed is 30% of your FICO score.**

This category is somewhat complex, and it generates a lot of confusion when discussed. Also called *credit utilization,* this includes the following sub-factors (among other things), in varying amounts:

* The total amount of credit available vs. the total amount of balances on [revolving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_credit) accounts.
* The amount of credit available on individual revolving accounts vs. the individual balances.
* The original loan amounts on [installment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installment_credit) accounts vs. the current loan balance.
* Amounts owed.
* Number of accounts with balances.

Your utilization is calculated using the most recent reports from your financial institutions. Since most banks and credit unions report the *statement balance* to the bureaus, you can safely assume that your most recent statement balances are what your score is based off of.

One important thing to note is that utilization does not have a history. There is no ""average utilization"". It is solely based on the most recent reports from your financial institutions. So it really is only a ""snapshot"" of your liabilities, and can improve or crash in the span of less than a month. It's generally advised that you can ignore utilization until a month or two before applying for a new line of credit.

Generally speaking, if you are above 30% of your credit limit, a lender may consider you to be higher risk. A statement with a 30% utilization will hurt your score until a lower balance is reported. This is only a transient problem, however, since (once again) utilization has no memory.

It logically follows that paying down debts and keeping balances low will increase your score. The lower your balances, the better. In addition to this, it is often helpful to apply for (or randomly be approved for) limit increases. Just be wary of hard inquiries.

**Your length of history counts toward 15% of your FICO score.**

This category takes into account, among other things, the following information:

* Age of your oldest tradeline.
* Age of your newest tradeline.
* Average age of accounts (AAoA).

It's fairly straightforward to think that the longer you have been managing credit, the more experience you have with keeping in time with payments and dealing with financial institutions. Therefore, you are seen as less of a risk.

All tradelines, both opened and closed, will contribute to your AAoA until the 10 year mark.

**Your types of credit in use is 10% of your FICO score.**

Consumers can benefit from a diverse mix of accounts. A combination of installment and revolving credit will bolster a score slightly, since the lender knows that the consumer has dealt with different types of tradelines. In addition, the number of each type of account is factored in.

It is not, however, necessary to take out a loan simply to boost this category (it is actually detrimental to some degree). Credit cards are sufficient tools for building credit history, and this category will take care of itself in due time. Never take out a loan simply to boost your score.

**Your credit-seeking activity counts toward 10% of your FICO score.**

FICO figures that, statistically, consumers that seek out lots and lots of credit in a short period of time tend to be higher risk. This is reflected in your score to some degree, as you can expect. When you apply for credit to be extended to you, it typically results in something called a *hard** inquiry*.

[Hard inquiries](http://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/New-Credit.aspx), by themselves, are not that big of a deal. For most credit files, your score will take a hit of less than 5 points. A hard inquiry will continue to affect your score for one year, and will fall off your report entirely after two years. The only warning here is to avoid too many inquiries in a short period of time.

Sometimes, for information and other general purposes, some companies will pull your credit report *without* the intent to extend credit to you, resulting in something called a *soft inquiry*. While you may see [soft inquiries](https://www.creditkarma.com/article/hard_inquiries_and_soft_inquiries) on your credit report for up to two years, **soft inquiries do not affect your score, **and lenders do not consider them. So while it's common for lenders to offer pre-approvals for credit cards or loans, this does not count as credit-seeking activity, since you are *not* applying for credit.

**Special note:** You are given a 45-day ""grace period"" to shop around for the best auto loans or mortgage rates, and have it count only as one inquiry. It is always in your best interest to get the lowest rate you can, and FICO recognizes that money saving habits are different from credit seeking habits. This grace period, however, is not extended to credit cards.

## Common Credit Myths and Misconceptions

**""Not using your credit card will hurt your score.""**

This is a hard one to pull apart, because it contains a couple of half-truths. The first truth is that 0% utilization across *all* your revolving accounts looks bad for the month. But again, this is somewhat of a non-issue, because (as above) utilization only counts for the most recent reports from your bank or credit union. So if you were to charge a pack of gum and let the statement report, you would be right back where you used to be.

The second truth is that sometimes banks will close accounts that have not seen activity for six months or so. If this is just one of your many cards, closing will bring down your credit available, increasing your utilization and thus decreasing your score. If it's your oldest account, it will also bring down your age of accounts. Before letting a card go inactive, always check your terms to make sure.

Really, other than that, an inactive, open card will [not affect your score](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2012/05/24/can-freezing-a-credit-card-hurt-your-score) positively or negatively. The only thing you can consider it to be is a *missed opportunity* to increase your number of on-time payments. Otherwise, it will keep your utilization low and your average ages matured.

**""You should carry a balance and pay interest on your credit card to build trust with the bank.""**

I [tackled this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1s9u4g/your_friend_is_an_idiot_and_youre_wasting_your/) already.

**""You need to use a certain percentage of your credit limit every month""**

There is only one credit utilization adage that matters: *the lower, the better.* Utilization does not have any memory, so it's pointless to force yourself to spend a certain amount to get a higher score. In addition to this, your credit history will not contain the amounts paid on revolving accounts; they will only record whether or not you paid on time.

Simply focus on sticking to only regular expenses, and pay off your statement in full every month.

**""I should take out an installment loan for no reason other than to pay it back and boost my score.""**

You really shouldn't. While you *will*, over time, gradually build a payment history, keep in mind that *account mix* is only a small fraction of your score. It's not worth paying hundreds in interest to see what is often a five point increase in your score for this category. Not to mention, your *amounts owed* category (which is 30% of your score) will be damaged for the time you are paying it off.

Instead, consider getting a credit card (or secured card, if you have little or bad credit history and can't get a regular card) and paying the statement balance in full each month. That will build a strong enough payment history without having to pay interest.

**""I should pay the minimums on one of my loans, because if I pay it off completely, it will stop contributing to my score.""**

This is a myth. While you will no longer have the opportunity to increase your number of on time payments, the good history associated with your loans (as well as the loan's contribution to your age of accounts) will continue to add to your credit score until the date of closure reaches the 10-year mark. This is true [even of credit cards](http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Understanding-FICO-Scoring/Calculating-Average-Account-Age/m-p/13256?view=by_date_ascending).

Naturally, you don't need to pay a dime in interest that you don't need to in order to have an excellent score. If you want to keep contributing to your number of on time payments, take out a credit card and pay off the statement balance every month.

**""Checking my own credit will hurt my credit score.""**

When you check your own credit, FICO recognizes that *you are not seeking new credit*. Checking your own credit will not decrease your score. To the same effect, most monitoring systems like CreditKarma or Quizzle are *soft* inquiries; and the same goes with cards that offer free FICO scores with their monthly statement. Again, the real risk that FICO is trying to quantify is your credit-seeking activity. If you're not signing on for new credit or credit increases, you are not going to affect your score.

**""I can bring up my AAoA by closing my youngest account.""**

Not entirely true. Your AAoA is calculated by *all* tradelines, including closed accounts. Your closed account doesn't magically get erased. Instead, closed accounts will continue contributing to your score until the 10-year mark from the date it was closed.

You *will,* however, change your *age of your newest account*, listed above. But addition to this, you will also diminish your overall credit available, which is the biggest risk of closing an account if you can't recover the limit elsewhere.

Taxable income if surrendered would be roughly ~$12k each. It is my understanding that our only option is to contribute back to the policies until the loans are paid back. Is this correct? I’m still struggling to know exactly how these policies work in terms of cash value, taxes, and long-term value. I know that whole life insurance policies are not considered the best investments, but what are my best options to deal with this situation? Thanks so much!",finance,1393974143
personalfinance,FICO Scoring 101: Behind the Numbers,"Simply put, a credit score is a firm's numerical assessment that quantifies the question: *What kind of risk am I taking on this person?* With credit scores becoming one of the cornerstones of pre-employment screening and apartment leases, it's important to discern from fact and rumor when it comes to managing your score.

The [traditional credit score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AtM1R9NmwM) is calculated using an algorithm from Fair, Isaac, and Company, or FICO for short. The algorithm takes information from one of the three credit bureaus that gather information on your payment history: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax. A computer generates a number based on one of your reports, and spits out your credit score. This number can range from 850 (perfect credit) all the way down to 300 (perfectly terrible credit).

However, there are several different *""flavors""* of credit scores. FICO has tuned their algorithm to give out a mortgage score, an auto score, a bankcard score, and so on and so forth. Even more: your score in any of these categories will be different depending on which bureau originated it. Your TransUnion score will be different from your Experian score, for example. But no matter where it comes from, every score is based on the health of five different factors:

**Your payment history is 35% of your FICO score.**

Naturally, the biggest indicator of whether someone will pay their bill on time is how well they've done so in the past. Some of the best credit scores have an extremely long history of on-time payments. This means that missed payments, delinquencies, collections accounts, judgements, and other derogatory marks will affect your score negatively. While they hurt your score, though, they do not do so permanently. Bad marks fall off at the 7 year mark.

Unfortunately, paying utilities, rent, and other bills don't contribute to your score. These accounts do not count as *tradelines*, or lines of credit, so FICO doesn't consider them. However, if they get passed on to a collections agency, they *will* affect your score negatively.

So if there is one thing to know about this category, it's to always pay your bills on time. Ideally, especially for your credit cards, *you will want to pay all of your statement balances in full every month to avoid paying interest.*

**Special note:** An interesting fact about the FICO algorithm is that you need six months of history to even register a score. Applicants with ""thin files"" will actually have *no score* associated with them.

**Your amounts owed is 30% of your FICO score.**

This category is somewhat complex, and it generates a lot of confusion when discussed. Also called *credit utilization,* this includes the following sub-factors (among other things), in varying amounts:

* The total amount of credit available vs. the total amount of balances on [revolving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_credit) accounts.
* The amount of credit available on individual revolving accounts vs. the individual balances.
* The original loan amounts on [installment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installment_credit) accounts vs. the current loan balance.
* Amounts owed.
* Number of accounts with balances.

Your utilization is calculated using the most recent reports from your financial institutions. Since most banks and credit unions report the *statement balance* to the bureaus, you can safely assume that your most recent statement balances are what your score is based off of.

One important thing to note is that utilization does not have a history. There is no ""average utilization"". It is solely based on the most recent reports from your financial institutions. So it really is only a ""snapshot"" of your liabilities, and can improve or crash in the span of less than a month. It's generally advised that you can ignore utilization until a month or two before applying for a new line of credit.

Generally speaking, if you are above 30% of your credit limit, a lender may consider you to be higher risk. A statement with a 30% utilization will hurt your score until a lower balance is reported. This is only a transient problem, however, since (once again) utilization has no memory.

It logically follows that paying down debts and keeping balances low will increase your score. The lower your balances, the better. In addition to this, it is often helpful to apply for (or randomly be approved for) limit increases. Just be wary of hard inquiries.

**Your length of history counts toward 15% of your FICO score.**

This category takes into account, among other things, the following information:

* Age of your oldest tradeline.
* Age of your newest tradeline.
* Average age of accounts (AAoA).

It's fairly straightforward to think that the longer you have been managing credit, the more experience you have with keeping in time with payments and dealing with financial institutions. Therefore, you are seen as less of a risk.

All tradelines, both opened and closed, will contribute to your AAoA until the 10 year mark.

**Your types of credit in use is 10% of your FICO score.**

Consumers can benefit from a diverse mix of accounts. A combination of installment and revolving credit will bolster a score slightly, since the lender knows that the consumer has dealt with different types of tradelines. In addition, the number of each type of account is factored in.

It is not, however, necessary to take out a loan simply to boost this category (it is actually detrimental to some degree). Credit cards are sufficient tools for building credit history, and this category will take care of itself in due time. Never take out a loan simply to boost your score.

**Your credit-seeking activity counts toward 10% of your FICO score.**

FICO figures that, statistically, consumers that seek out lots and lots of credit in a short period of time tend to be higher risk. This is reflected in your score to some degree, as you can expect. When you apply for credit to be extended to you, it typically results in something called a *hard inquiry*.

[Hard inquiries](http://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/New-Credit.aspx), by themselves, are not that big of a deal. For most credit files, your score will take a hit of less than 5 points. A hard inquiry will continue to affect your score for one year, and will fall off your report entirely after two years. The only warning here is to avoid too many inquiries in a short period of time.

Sometimes, for information and other general purposes, some companies will pull your credit report *without* the intent to extend credit to you, resulting in something called a *soft inquiry*. While you may see [soft inquiries](https://www.creditkarma.com/article/hard_inquiries_and_soft_inquiries) on your credit report for up to two years, **soft inquiries do not affect your score,** and lenders do not consider them. So while it's common for lenders to offer pre-approvals for credit cards or loans, this does not count as credit-seeking activity, since you are *not* applying for credit.

**Special note:** You are given a 45-day ""grace period"" to shop around for the best auto loans or mortgage rates, and have it count only as one inquiry. It is always in your best interest to get the lowest rate you can, and FICO recognizes that money saving habits are different from credit seeking habits. This grace period, however, is not extended to credit cards.

## Common Credit Myths and Misconceptions

**""Not using your credit card will hurt your score.""**

This is a hard one to pull apart, because it contains a couple of half-truths. The first truth is that 0% utilization across *all* your revolving accounts looks bad for the month. But again, this is somewhat of a non-issue, because (as above) utilization only counts for the most recent reports from your bank or credit union. So if you were to charge a pack of gum and let the statement report, you would be right back where you used to be.

The second truth is that sometimes banks will close accounts that have not seen activity for six months or so. If this is just one of your many cards, closing will bring down your credit available, increasing your utilization and thus decreasing your score. If it's your oldest account, it will also bring down your age of accounts. Before letting a card go inactive, always check your terms to make sure.

Really, other than that, an inactive, open card will [not affect your score](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2012/05/24/can-freezing-a-credit-card-hurt-your-score) positively or negatively. The only thing you can consider it to be is a *missed opportunity* to increase your number of on-time payments. Otherwise, it will keep your utilization low and your average ages matured.

**""You should carry a balance and pay interest on your credit card to build trust with the bank.""**

I [tackled this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1s9u4g/your_friend_is_an_idiot_and_youre_wasting_your/) already.

**""You need to use a certain percentage of your credit limit every month""**

There is only one credit utilization adage that matters: *the lower, the better*. Some of the best scores only have utilization between 1 and 9% (rounded up).

Utilization does not have any memory, so it's pointless to force yourself to spend above or below a certain amount to get a higher score in a month that you're not applying for new credit. In addition to this, your credit score will not factor the amounts paid on revolving accounts; the only thing that matters from month-to-month is whether you paid on time.

Simply focus on sticking to only regular expenses, and pay off your statement in full every month.

**""I should take out an installment loan for no reason other than to pay it back and boost my score.""**

You really shouldn't. While you *will*, over time, gradually build a payment history, keep in mind that *account mix* is only a small fraction of your score. It's not worth paying hundreds in interest to see what is often a five point increase in your score for this category. Not to mention, your *amounts owed* category (which is 30% of your score) will be damaged for the time you are paying it off.

Instead, consider getting a credit card (or secured card, if you have little or bad credit history) and paying the statement balance in full each month. That will build a strong enough payment history without having to pay interest.

**""I should pay the minimums on one of my loans, because if I pay it off completely, it will stop contributing to my score.""**

This is a myth. While you will no longer have the opportunity to increase your number of on time payments, the good history associated with your loans (as well as the loan's contribution to your age of accounts) will continue to add to your credit score until the date of closure reaches the 10-year mark. This is true [even of credit cards](http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Understanding-FICO-Scoring/Calculating-Average-Account-Age/m-p/13256?view=by_date_ascending).

Naturally, you don't need to pay a dime in interest that you don't need to in order to have an excellent score. If you want to keep contributing to your number of on time payments, take out a credit card and pay off the statement balance every month.

**""Checking my own credit will hurt my credit score.""**

When you check your own credit, FICO recognizes that *you are not seeking new credit*. Checking your own credit will not decrease your score. To the same effect, most monitoring systems like CreditKarma or Quizzle are *soft* inquiries; and the same goes with cards that offer free FICO scores with their monthly statement. Again, the real risk that FICO is trying to quantify is your credit-seeking activity. If you're not signing on for new credit or credit increases, you are not going to affect your score.

**""I can bring up my AAoA by closing my youngest account.""**

Not entirely true. Your AAoA is calculated by *all* tradelines, including closed accounts. Your closed account doesn't magically get erased. Instead, closed accounts will continue contributing to your score until the 10-year mark from the date it was closed.

You *will,* however, change your *age of your newest account*, listed above. But addition to this, you will also diminish your overall credit available, which is the biggest risk of closing an account if you can't recover the limit elsewhere.

personalfinance,Looking to purchase a home - VA Loan/No Debts,"Hello there r/personalfinance!

My wife and I are looking to move our small family into our first home after living in apartments for some time.  I am a full-time student, and my wife is a salaried Registered Dietitian with a local organization.  

I draw GI Bill benefits of $1.2K as a Full-Time Student (and *appear* to have a job this summer paying ~$1K a month, which will count as Full-Time school as well, so the $1.2K will continue to come in).  *I realize this is not traditional ""income"", just full disclosure from me*.

My wife earns approximately $43.5K.

We have no major debts whatsoever.  Our expenses monthly hover around ~$1K, primarily associated with daycare/car payment.  We are frugal budgeters and track our money judiciously.

Using Navy Federal Credit Union for pre-approval, we have been offered a $160,000 loan, but realize this is not a reasonable price for us.  We are looking at a home that is currently $137,900.  We have $13K in savings, which will be used towards closing costs not absorbed by the seller, and the VA Funding Fee is going to be added to the mortgage.  Future large inflows include ~$5-6K tax return (EIC, low income from my last year of service due to tax-free zones, etc.), and withdrawal from TSP of $2K.

That's where we are financially.  Some things we know:

1. Get three compartmentalized inspections for home, termite, black mold.
2. Remain cognizant of the fact that because of $0 down payment, interest remains a financial burden for a duration.
3. To somewhat counter the above, we're paying the full points possible to secure the current 3.375% interest rate.

We're excited at the proposition, but do realize there are risks as well.  At this point in our life, we feel the benefits of our own private yard, a reasonable space to live in, and lack of roaches at our sink every morning outweigh the risks of having to spend some of our liquid assets on repairs that may crop up, or improvements we'd like to make.

I'm calling on the collective conscious to give us feedback!  I ask only for your honesty and expertise.

My questions will be.

Where do you seek the Canadian Market heading? What are you using as indicators for this?

The Canadian market is heavily influenced by finance and resource industries. What weaknesses do you think this exposes the Canadian economy to? 

How is TD planning their business for the future? What big opportunities do they see for the bank and for return for shareholders? What about customers?

personalfinance,"Using HELOC to pay off Mortgage on Investment Property, Good Idea?","My current situation is this, I'm refinancing my primary residence to get a better interest rate and out of PMI. I've gotten my primary residence appraised at $410k and will owe $205k after the refi. I will be able to take a HELOC (Home Equity Line Of Credit) out for up to $123k @ 2.5% for the first 6 months and Prime +.25% with a baseline of 3.5% after the intro period. There is no fee for me to do this. I also own an investment property, which is worth ~$250k. The current mortgage on that property is approximately $133k @ 4.75% with PMI (I also hate the mortgage company which recently bought this loan). PMI = $70 a month.

My thought is to take the $123k from the HELOC and with $10k of cash pay off the investment property. I can pay down the $123k in approximately 3 years. This will free me from the terrible bank and reduce my interest rate. My concerns are mainly about complication and problems related to taxes. Everything I've read says generally HELOC interest is tax deductible for the first $100k of credit, but I have seen some people say that if used on an investment property, the interest of the HELOC is directly deductible from the investment property profit, even in amounts over the interest on the $100k of credit.

I could always refinance the investment property to a 15yr fixed at 4%, or a 5/1ARM @ 3.5% but that comes with upfront costs estimated to be $2k - $3k, hassle for an appraisal, and more time spent, not to mention more interest costs, but with a more simple tax scenario.

So any advice on the HELOC strategy?

TLDR: Use a $123k HELOC to pay off an investment property, how bad will this mess up my taxes and is this a bad idea?",finance,1393983219

Up for auction at Stuffcoins, ending Friday night, are the first 3 painted DogeFed Fine Art Paper Wallets!

This is the very first DogeFed Fine Art Paper Wallet auction for charity. With proceeds split 50-50 between the painter and her chosen charity, the [Foundation Fighting Blindness (blindness.org)](http://blindness.org), we are auctioning off three painted paper wallets by [Zineb Kohen](https://twitter.com/z_kokotte), artist.

As art, these paintings simply require framing and tasteful display in the finest richshibe homes, galleries, and museums. As wallets, these will be functional art, serving as DogeFed Alpha test articles. (Wallet elements to be applied to paper border or back per buyer preference) You won't want to pass these around from shibe to shibe, but they are perhaps the best way to present a gift of DOGE and, kept sealed, would make a fine cold storage.

The first three paintings are, with auction links:

At DogeFed we were struck by how quickly Zineb managed to grasp the essential elements of doge, producing such spot-on interpretations after a brief acquaintance. She had this to say about her first impressions of Dogecoin:

""I stumbled on Doge few weeks ago, and was instantly fascinated by the idea behind the digital currency. The most interesting thing to me is that Doge is not only about money; rather it unites people around a societal vision and a humanistic ethic. As an artist with a visual condition, I jumped at the chance to develop Doge’s image and promise half of the auction’s money to Foundation Fighting Blindness.""

Zineb has agreed to license these images for use by the DogeCoin community under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license! Such generosity, much copying! Spread them far and wide. (600 dpi JPEGs/TIFFs available on request for print and high-res needs.)

All funds received from this auction will be transferred to a dedicated, published wallet - transparently and accountably, 50% will be sent to Zineb and 50% will be converted to USD for charity.

* we're both maxing out our company's 401k match

It seems like we're doing pretty well (right?) and on the right track but i do have some questions.

Second, what about a joint credit card, should we open one with a different bank or stick with chase for the rewards? For this I'm more so concerned about all of our eggs in one basket, will that do anything for our credit scores, should we be looking to go with a different bank? We're also hoping to get a house this year so i want to pay off as much debt as i can before i pick up a mortgage. 

With a lot of talk about marriage being a financial nightmare, I just want to say that having a second income makes it so much easier to manage our finances. Neither of us would have been able to pay off a car or student loans by ourselves as quickly as we are now. With what we've already paid off leaves us with the ability to quickly pay off our other expenses and leave us with some extra cash to blow and/or save up.",finance,1394036417

personalfinance,What should I do with my money until I graduate? (Will be in college for two more years),"So I see a lot of advise on here for people already out in the ""real world,"" and have to balance saving with expenses (such as rent, cars, mortgage, etc). However, I'm 20 years old and still in college (currently a sophomore). I wanted to know what you guys think is the best thing to do with my money with respect to short-term saving/investing taking into account the only real ""surprise cost"" that I need to plan for would be a new car if my current one breaks.


My Situation:

- I don't have any formal student loans; my parents right now are covering everything out of pocket. After I graduate college, they would like me to repay part of my education ($50,000) within a ""reasonable"" time frame.

- No debt (other than college) besides my current ~$200 credit card balance which gets automatically drawn in full from my savings account every month.

- Because I've had job since I was 14 (especially due to the internship I had last summer) and am very frugal, I've managed save up roughly $10k.

- Currently, ~$1,900 of that is in stocks I purchased last summer spread across three companies (one I would consider risky, one medium risk, and one blue chip). The remaining $8,000 is in cash, with the majority sitting in a savings account making 0.75% interest.

- I have another internship lined up for this summer would should make me roughly $9,000 before taxes and will probably (hopefully) have another for next summer making roughly the same.

- Since I am going to have very few expenses for the next ~2.5 years (and thus won't need to get to it), I have no qualms about locking away my money into a short-term bond or CD.

- Since I have a more money than I'll 'need', I have no problems with (a reasonable amount of) risk.

- I want to pay back my parents as soon as possible after I graduate (I hate owing people money, especially relatives or friends) while still having enough for a rainy day fund

- My current car has 265,000 miles, but is in surprisingly good shape considering that fact. I think it will actually last until graduation (it's a manual so the transmission is virtually indestructible, has a newish clutch, and newish struts), but regardless, I want to have roughly ~$4-5k available in case it does break.

- I want to have a reasonable amount of money upon graduating to afford an apartment (I don't want to move back in with my parents), a new car (if my current one doesn't break), utilities, etc until I get a job


Since interest rates right now are piss poor, I was leaning more towards putting the majority of my current $8k into the market. I was thinking one of the following:

- Buy $1000 worth (each) of 6 or 7 blue chip stocks that pay dividends

- Buy $1000 worth (each) of 4 or 5 riskier stocks, and pick up some long term put options to mitigate the risk. Keep the rest of the money out of the market in bonds or CDs to mitigate the risk a little more

- Put $6000-7000 in a reputable mutual fund or index fund

Also, I think the money from my internship this summer will go into a safer investment such as bonds or CDs which will act as my new (used) car fund if necessary.

Do any of you have any tips or suggestions for me on what I should do to better prepare for my future in the real world?

personalfinance,Debating which loan to pay a large amount of money on (Ca),"Hello everyone! I have been going back and forth debating with myself on this issue and thought I would bring the question to the experts.

I currently have saved up about $8000 (I also have an emergency fund) to be paid to one of two loans I have in repayment.

The first is a bank loan that I used at the time I needed to buy a car:
I owe $7445.45. The interest rate is 3+5.25%. Paying 168.07/month.

The second is my student loan:
I owe $28,860.65. The interest rate is 5.5% floating. Paying 334.66/month.

I can not decide which loan the $8000 would be better going towards. It would completely eliminate the bank loan (which has the higher interest) and leave a bit left over to go towards the student loan. But at the same time the larger debt in the student loan costs more in interest despite a lower rate. Having the bank loan gone would mean an extra 168.07/month that could automatically go towards the student loan.",finance,1394048363

personalfinance,Just got my first real job. Want to clean up years of past financial mistakes and become an actual adult – and buy my (attainable) dream car. Wanna help?,"Throwaway account, here.  After 10 years of being a poor musician/valet, I got tired of never having money/health insurance/vacations/a reliable, fun car.  I absolutely love cars, and at 30, I realized that with the way my life was going, I was never going to own a car that I loved, much less cross any dream cars off my list.  Went back to school and finally landed a dream job a week ago.  Pays 52K with full bennies, 18 days paid vacation and a 401K.  I live in the midwest, so 52K is actually a great starting salary, and the field I'm in is great about giving large raises fairly often.

My goal is to buy a new (or almost new) car – a 2011-2014 WRX 5-door.  They go for around 20-28K depending on options and condition.  I understand that this probably won't happen anytime soon.  I really don't care how long it takes – it's the biggest reason that I changed my life around, and without that goal in mind, I wouldn't have followed through with it.  I'd like your help in figuring out the smartest way to get the car of my attainable dreams.

Some hurdles:  Around 2008, I got in a bind and took a $1,800 cash advance on a credit card with a high interest rate (I know, I know) to buy a car to get to work.  I defaulted on the card, of course.  The balance is now somewhere north of 6K, and in the hands of a different creditor every couple of months.  How should this be dealt with?  I've heard that after 7 years something happens, but I don't know what.  It should also be said that the credit card was through my current bank, so they will not be providing me with a car loan until the old card is paid off.

Other than that, I'm ok in other ways – my student loan was only for 18K, and I haven't started paying it yet.  My rent is only about $350 living with my SO.  All of my utilities are included in my rent.  I walk to work.  My car obviously doesn't have a payment, but is only worth about $1000.  It also might die relatively soon (head gaskets, a $2000 fix).  I have nothing in the bank whatsoever.  Earlier this year, I got a $300 credit card for the sole purpose of fixing (or positively affecting) my credit.  I use it and pay more than the minimum every month.  I leave a balance on it because I've heard that that's better than paying it off.

So yeah.  What do you think?  How would you go about buying a $26,000 car if you were in my shoes?  I'm at your fiduciary mercy.  Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Was just paid a decent lump sum from ex-employer in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. What do I do?,"I worked with a company for roughly 2 years, and then they were bought out and I resigned 4 months later (didn't like the new company and had a better opportunity). Anyways, I was just given my Employee Stock Owner Plan about a year after resigning my position with them. It's a little over 11k, and I have until the end of March to decide on what to do with the money. The options are getting a distribution and the money is taxed (not sure what the rate is? 20% federally? I live in FL if that means anything), or I transfer/rollover the money to an IRA or something else that's available.

My situation:
28 and unemployed, but talking with 2 companies right now. I have an interview tomorrow and an unofficial offer that's been on the table for a month now. Long story as to why it's not official, but there is a chance the official offer may come through this week or next from what he tells me... (I'm not putting my faith in him though). Been unemployed since early January after the start up I was working for halted the project and laid everyone off (was a leadership issue not funding). I only have about 4k to collect in unemployment benefits which I haven't started yet, but will be by end of month if not employed. I've got roughly 14k to live off of. I'm in my parents house right now so my bills are mainly my car payment and college loans, which amount to around 900 a month. I just deferred my only government loan starting this month which only saves me about 160 a month. The other are private loans. I have no 401k or IRA started. Each company I've worked for hasn't had one and if they did I wasn't with them long enough to have anything started. I'm starting to get concerned that I'm almost 30 and do not have anything started towards retirement. Which is where my dilemma comes in.

What should I do with this new lump sum of money? Take the taxable distribution which would probably be around 9k, or take a chance of possibly thinking I'll be employed soon and rollover the money into a new IRA account I set up with someone (recommendations on where to set this up?). Also I just learned there is probably an IRS taxable penalty for chasing out which would reduce my take out to around 7k. I'm leaning towards rolling over, but concerned I won't get job placement quick enough and need the money to live off of. It's been a long two months unemployed so far, and it's looking bleak if these two jobs don't pull through for me. I also don't know anything about how to set up an IRA.

**EDIT** 
I just got an official offer letter from the guy I've been talking to for a month that I mentioned above. So this changes my situation a little bit. So now lets add another situation to what's already above. Say I accept the job offer (probably going to anyways) now I have this 11k that I can pull out or rollover. Do I pull it out and use it to pay off one of my college loans or is it more important I start an IRA?

I know for a fact that I have made some really unwise decisions in this course of being jobless nonchalantly assuming that I would have a job by now but that isn't the case. Fortunately I have learned a lot of things on the way.

Basically I pit myself in a bad situation at Walmart by accumulating bad attendance. It got to the point where if I had one more screw up I'd be fired. I was a cashier but one day I was assigned to push carts in the pouring rain. I did so for a few hours but during that time they claim they couldn't find me. Of course this led to the firing so the next day I filed for unemployment.

However your last absence was due to transportation issues over with you had control. Misconduct in connection with the work has been established.""

personalfinance,Cash Flow vs. Net Worth,"Alright, everyone. My wife and I were discussing our finances tonight and came to a bit of an impasse in regards to our thought process. I'd like your input because I don't think either of our rationale is inherently wrong.

A bit of backstory: We currently have two vehicles, a 2002 Civic which I use as a commuter vehicle and a 2009 Corolla S which she purchased prior to us getting married. Her credit is very rocky, so she purchased the vehicle at a 19.99% APR. Currently, we owe ~$14,000 on the vehicle, and it is worth an estimated $10,000. We were trying to weigh the differences between refinancing the vehicle or selling the vehicle to purchase an older vehicle, as she does not use the vehicle daily. In addition to this, we have a savings account with $6,000 in it (this includes our short-term emergency fund).

The reason we're needing to do this (besides to obviously do something about the interest rate) is because we just had a baby, and my wife is now working part-time from home. With this, our monthly cash flow is not sufficient for our needs.

Basically, the debate is a higher net worth vs. more cash flow per month.

Currently we pay $551.69 per month for her vehicle and insurance for both our vehicles.

If we refinance the vehicle, our net worth (for the vehicle and emergency fund) would be $2,000. Monthly cash out-flow would be $341.16 including insurance on both vehicles.

If we sell the vehicle, and purchase a $6,500 vehicle, our net worth would end up being -$2,825 with current vehicle pay-off, taxes and down payment on the new vehicle included. In this scenario, monthly cash out-flow for the vehicle and insurance on both vehicles would be $253.84.

There is a difference in net worth of $4,825 at the cost of $87.32 per month in cash flow. My concern is that, by that math, we would need this new vehicle (the purchase of an older vehicle) to last us at least 55 months to cover the loss of net worth. 

Is a net worth increase of $4,825 worth more than $87.32 per month when talking about a vehicle? Thoughts?

If there's anything additional that I can clarify, such as how I got these numbers, please don't hesitate to ask.",finance,1394074116

Bitcoin,Economia (March 2014) realistic opinion article,"Hey guys, I read this article just this morning in Economia.

Here's a link to the 'e-magazine':

http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/adff9b38#/adff9b38/32

EXTRACT:

&gt; **'Bitcoin is the secret to a safer, more efficient financial system'** Garrick Hileman
&gt; 
&gt; The internet currency Bitcoin is surrounded by uncertainty. Is it a speculative bubble? Is it as anonymous as is claimed? Can it be used to purchase the legendary White Widow marijuana or hire a hit man? But these questions divert attention from far more important discussions about Bitcoin's potential to drive financial innovation.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin has transcended partisan ideologies. Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman and US Tea Party icon Ron Paul are diametrically opposed on virtually every issue *but* Bitcoin (both dislike it). Yet Bitcoin's opponenets should ask how the groundbreaking ideas that underlie it could be applied to reforming the global financial system. Although the 2008 financial crisis exposed profound institutional shortcomings, subsequent regulatory safeguards, like the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the Basel III, have failed to bring about transformation. Likewise, protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, aimed ultimately at reforming the culture of finance, have delivered mixed results.
&gt; 
&gt; The fact is no one, except a small coterie of financial insiders who have benefited from taxpayer-financed bailouts, should be satisfied with the current system, not least because another crisis, accompanied by more bailouts, can be expected in the near future.
&gt; 
&gt; While the exact timing of the next meltdown is unknown, one thing is certain: consideration of what kind of financial system we need would be incomplete without Bitcoin. The technology behind it could not only help to reduce risk by creating safeguards shielding the payments system from unpredictable financial activities; it could also bolster growth.
&gt; 
&gt; Financial institutions act as matchmakers, linking investors, borrowers and savers, and recording what people own and owe. In exchange for these services they are generously compensated. So, to ask whether bankers' pay is fair is really to ask how much value is created by financial matchmaking - and there is no simple answer. By allowing a greater proportion of an economy's wealth to be channeled toward investment and other productive economic activities, a more efficient financial services industry boosts growth. Given the high costs of financial systems that are antiquated, costly and inefficient, the smaller the financial system, the better off everyone else will be.
&gt; 
&gt; Profit seeking is also a factor in the inefficiency of the world's financial system. While British authorities recently announced the transfer of physical cheques would be abolished, a two-day cheque-clearing delay will remain. As scanned images of cheques could be processed electronically almost instantaneously, the delay can be explained only by ""float"" - the interest earned by holding onto money for as long as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Float is one of the ways the financial services industry extracts resources from the economy. The 3-5% charge levied by credit card companies adds up to several hundred billion dollars in profits. Fees for wire transfers and currency exchange can climb to 10% per transaction. The innovations pioneered by Bitcoin eliminate the fees, delays and inefficiencies lining the pockets of the financial services industry. Ahead of US Senate hearings last November, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote to senators saying Bitcoin may ""hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure, and more efficient payment system"".
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin, with its capacity for anonymity, could make the global financial system more secure. At the same time it offers an alternative tore of value, and its use as a medium of exchange is steadily growing. But perhaps the most exciting innovation offered by Bitcoin is the ""Blockchain"" - peer-to-peer software that keeps a record of all transactions and a tally of who owns what. The Blockchain serves the ""ledger"" function of banks, but at a fraction of the cost.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin marks a return to a community-based approach to money and banking, with financial services more closely connected to the people. Large, monolitic third-party managers, like ""too big to fail"" banks"", would be cut out. With software like the Blockchain powering a new financial architecture, ""the people"" would effectively become the bank.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin and its ecosystem are maturing, and only time will tell if its current price is a speculative bubble. But the innovations pioneered by Bitcoin could play a transformative role in building a safer, less expensive and more effective financial system.

I think it's well written and takes a realistic view on the potential of both Bitcoin and the technology that it uses. While it does only talk about Bitcoin for a short amount of time, it highlights the issues with the current financial system and what Bitcoin could do to remedy some of its vices.",cryptocurrency,1394094483

Bitcoin,speculation: MtGox was closed because of SilkRoad investigation,"This theory was pretty quick to build some steam after the closure but hardly any evidence was ever used to support it (besides the fact that it would fit with MK behavior). Today nytimes broke the story of JTAN having hosted silkroad servers (http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/silk-road-had-digital-outpost-in-pennsylvania/).
In this article we get a perfect example of just how the FBI will treat a company when they are involved in the silkroad investigation. First of all this was all secret until very recently 
&gt; The search warrant on JTAN and the company’s involvement in the Silk Road case had remained a secret until a few weeks ago. On Feb. 18, federal prosecutors asked a United States magistrate in federal court in Philadelphia to unseal the matter so authorities could begin providing Mr. Ulbricht’s lawyer with information to begin planning a legal defense.

From this we know that IF mtgox has their assets seized and are forced to play a part in the investigation then they would be forced to stay quiet. The article also says
&gt; Mr. Nadovich has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

If this is a good parallel then we have no reason to believe that MK might be implicated.
This is all backed by the quote from MK on IRC
&gt; 03:13 &lt;@ne0futur&gt; 2014-02-20 10:40&lt;MagicalTux&gt; le gouv. US veut pas qu'on disclose hein
03:13 &lt;@ne0futur&gt; US gov doesnt want us to disclose

He also stated that
&gt; &lt;MagicalTux&gt; Well, technically speaking it’s not “lost” just yet, just temporarily unavailable

and from the following article one can read that http://thegenesisblock.com/mt-gox-seizures-linked-silk-road-fed-testimonies/
&gt; Recent testimonies by federal agencies indicate that the account seizures were in fact related to the multi-year pursuit of Silk Road operators, rather than a crackdown on money transmission infractions for their own sake.

This refers to the dwolla seizing. So it is clear that MtGox is under investigation from the US government and they have had their dwolla account seized because of the silkroad investigation. MK does not want to talk about the source of the missing or ""temporarily unavailable"" bitcoins because of ""le gouv"" and here is the kicker:
&gt; Just days after the F.B.I. served the search warrant on JTAN, Mr. Nadovich began taking steps to close parts of his business. In a Sept. 14 online notice to JTAN customers that still appears on the company’s website, Mr. Nadovich said he was terminating the firm’s “dedicated server” business. Mr. Nadovich gave no explanation but said “the business situation we find ourselves in does not allow continuing this service.” On Oct. 30, he posted another notice, telling JTAN customers the company was struggling financially and could file for bankruptcy protection in 2014.

So after JTAN became a part of the silkroad investigation they saw themselves unable to continue business as usual and filed for **bankruptcy protection** citing financial trouble.",cryptocurrency,1394097052
Bitcoin,BitSource Wildlife Conservation,"Wouldn't it be a great to crowdsource funding for somebody's Kickstarter which is a noble conservation geared project that uses UAV/drone technology to combat poachers and save dwindling species from extinction. The method they propose is the only practical method of enforcing the laws with any effectiveness in an affordable fashion for those doing the conservation efforts. 
I was thinking that if a solid Kickstarter campaign like this

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/846841162/team-arend-wildlife-conservation-uav?ref=live

could reach its funding goal, in large part to a bitcoin collections being given to their campaign, and their campaign sees some notable success (as it is likely to see if it is launched), then the bitcoin community would look real stand-up to the public while doing an invaluable service to the planet as a whole. If anybody is interested in pooling a donation somehow we could work that out and hand over the total collected coins to the campaigners who will convert it to accepted currency on kickstarter. I'm sure that such a project like the one cited on kickstarter appeals to more than just those who enjoy kickstarting things. I'd also bet that there are many bitcoin users who are generous enough to slide some modest or generous donation towards the cause who would have never given squat to kickstarter. 

This is a really significant period in human history and it would be disgraceful to look back on ourselves and know that we snuffed out species after species with habitat loss and then even species we took out of existence with our own hands to make some illicit profits. All the while we do nothing?

crypto,Had to write an encryption scheme for a Python class; I'm curious about how one would go about cracking it.,"First, the scheme generates a key from a password. Given the password and a matching decoding function, the recipient should be able to regenerate the key.

My encryption function is basically a set of substitution ciphers with constanty-changing keys. Perhaps the best way to think of this scheme is by imagining it as a virtual Enigma machine. Imagine three wheels with the key embossed around their edges. The key is used as a substitution cipher for each individual letter. Before each letter is encoded, however, the first ""wheel"" spins, shifting the key by by *i* places (where *i* is the index value of the character being encoded). The resultant letter is then fed into the second ""wheel,"" which will already have shifted by 7*i*. Finally, this letter is fed into the third ""wheel,"" which will have shifted by *i*^2 + 1 places beforehand. The resultant letter is recorded, and the cycle repeats for each letter in the message.

The fact that the ""wheels"" are ""turning"" at different rates prevents the kind of 1-to-1 character correspondence that makes substitution ciphers so easy to crack. For example:

    my_encrypt(""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"", ""password"")

returns:

    'bsjnhjxgzfyu mpt fzs'

**How might one go about cracking a code like this?**

dogecoin,Idea - Cryptocurrency Video Site to Compete with YouTube,"Howdy Folks

I've got a crazy idea I wanted to get out of my head and share with you. Apologies in advance for the length of the post, but I like to include a lot of details. Also just FYI this has been crossposted to [the CrazyIdeas subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1zpr9q/cryptocurrency_video_site_to_compete_with_youtube/)

The **TL:DR** is:

Video website like YouTube but difference is users can 'tip' the video maker with Cryptocurrency e.g Dogecoin, BitCoin etc. Users can watch adverts to earn cryptocoin and could then answer advertiser questions after the video to get even more cryptocoin. Users could pick topics they are interested in and be shown adverts or promotional videos for those topics. Users then use that cryptocoin to tip the user generated video content.

**Detail**

The idea is a video streaming site like YouTube where a user can choose to watch adverts or promotional videos and get paid in Cryptocurrency for their time. The idea being they then use this earned Cryptocurrency to 'tip' the user generated videos they watch on the site.
The site would make money from the advert/promo vids which the advertisers pay for and the content producers would make money from the tips they receive from the viewers.

n.b all monetary values are just place holders and can be tweaked easily

If you sold 1 minute of video advertising for £0.10 per watch, then £0.05 would be given to user and £0.05 would be kept as revenue. The advertiser could then choose to have a survey after the video for an additional £0.10 per 5 questions and once again £0.05 would be given to user and £0.05 would be kept as revenue.
As the Crytocurrency is transferable out of the website there would have to be strict measures in place to stop bots from farming the site. There would have to be a check for the full advert being watched and a capatcha check for surveys.
There would also be diminishing returns so that after every 10 adverts payments are halfed and/or there could be limit in the amount you can earn in a set time period.
But you could also incentivise users to watch adverts with additional bonus payouts when 10 adverts are watched etc. Could take this further and have daily/monthly achievements such as 'watch 150 ads in 1 month = 1000 dogecoin' or the other way such as 'tip 50 videos at least 100 doge each = 1000 dogecoin'

Users could also transfer their own cryptocoin into their online account wallet and tip away as they want. Could also take a percentage cut of the tips e.g 5% of all tips. This would ensure the site makes money when a user transfers their own cryptocoin into the site. Preferred partners could have a lower tipping fee, or channels with 100,000+ subscribers could have lower fees.

The aim of the site is not to provide people with a way of earning a living through watching adverts, but is instead meant to be an alternative to YouTube where adverts are forced on you on every video. My idea gives users the choice to reward the content producers they like and the content producers can earn more money if they are popular.

As users would already be tipping normal user created videos, it would be easy to add a small paygate for big content producers. e.g Channel 4 could host the TV show, The IT Crowd, and users could pay 300 doge to unlock access to an episode for 1 month.

The site would need to ensure that content providers don't have their own adverts in video, making users watch double adverts. If users watch adverts to get coin then have to watch adverts/sponsorship messages then they will be put off.
Potentially this might be it's own fix. If there are more adverts/sponsorship then users might be less inclined to tip videos meaning content producer gets less anyway meaning they stop.
Alternative is to force any of these messages to appear at the end of the video (or not at all). But enforcing this would take up a lot of resources.

**Example**

A company like Mojang, who created the video game Minecraft, could purchase some advertising to show off Minecraft. A user who has selected Video Games as an interest would watch this and earn 100 dogecoins.
The user then watches a user created video on Minecraft and tips all 100 doge to the video.

If we take a user video with 10,000 views and say 5% of users tip 100 doge, then the video producer would earn 50,000 doge which right now is £30 ($50). So a video with 100,000 views would earn £300 ($500). (Minus the tipping fee on the site)

I'm not sure if 5% of the users participating is a bit high, but I think 5% of people taking 1 minute out of their day to watch an advert so they can tip a video they like isn't out of the bounds of reality.

Now, if we assume the site is more popular and people enjoy the cryptocoin functionality

If we take a user video with 10,000 views and say 2% of users tip 100 doge, 2% tip 300 doge and 2% tip 600 doge and 1% tip 1000 doge, then the producer would earn 300,000 doge which right now is £180 ($300). And a video with 100,000 views and the same payment breakdown would earn £1800 ($3000).

**Potential Problems**

Problem: As users can watch videos without ever tipping, nobody ever does meaning content producers never get paid, meaning they stop using the site.
Fix: need to make sure tipping is as easy as possible
Fix: make the fact other users are tipping obvious. If people see others tipping they will too
Fix: could have mini shops for user channels where people can buy items with cryptocoin
Fix: need to make sure site has lots of users (if this was easy everyone would do it)

Problem: As coins can be transferred off site, bots could game the system so they earn loads of cryptocoin. If this is common then advertisers will not use site
Fix: Implement features as above
Fix: Make sure that all steps require human interaction e.g transferring money offsite requires capatcha. This makes automated bots more difficult
Fix: Allow advertisers to easily lock down what countries their adverts are available to
Fix: Make sure that total earnings over time can never be too high

Problem: Content producers continually go on about making sure you tip them, ruining user experience.
Fix: this might fix itself as users will be less inclined to tip whiners
Fix: have a policy which says content producers are no allowed to beg for tips then implement an automatic system where if enough users complain the video is put up for review

Problem: The site would probably have to operate as a cyrptocurrency Exchange so that people can buy crytpocoin and the content producers can cash out
Fix: Could partner with an existing exchange
Fix: Could just setup an exchange and then earn more money from the exchanges

**Extra Income**

Could integrate a shop system in site where users can buy set items with channel branding. e.g have a range of posters, cups, t-shirts etc and the channel provider is able to create and upload their own art for these. Then when a user purchases say a cup, the order is sent to the correct manufacturer closest to the user location and manufactured and shipped. Site would get the majority cut of this purchase to cover costs, but content providers would also get a cut

Could 'outsource' tasks to users of the site and pay them in coin. e.g if a video gets put under review, a user could log in and review the video for 100 doge. The idea being the video is reviewed by lots of users to get a consensus. This may or may not be cheaper in the long run compared to hiring people to do this

Content Producers could allow the content to be downloaded for a small fee. I see this as being something the music industry could use where the download file is a high bitrate mp3 file.

**Summary**

Well let me know what you think. I think something like this could work but if it is to stand any chance it would need to have a fair chuck of capital investment to get going. Big/popular content producers would probably need to be enticed to the site to begin with and the infrastructure would cost a lot. However, it could be good competition for other video sites",cryptocurrency,1394109684
personalfinance,Debt is counterproductive. Captain Obvious,"Debt is counterproductive:
 
Debt becomes heavy over time if you don’t takes steps to reduce and eliminate it.  Debt is similar to the storage of fat cells in a heavy person’s body. That first double cheeseburger with crispy lawn green lettuce, juicy tomatoes, and sizzling bacon didn’t physically appear to make any difference to that figure after consumed.  As more cheeseburger’s (financed widgets) are taken on, the fat (debt) begins to pile up.  Just as the extreme buildup of fat cells limit a person’s ability to physically stretch and be flexible, debt limits a person’s flexibility.  They are unable to adapt to new, different, or changing investment environments.  The weight of the debt (fat) prevents any chance of possessing surplus funds to invest when the time is right.
 
Similar to an overweight person driving around on a scooter, debt limits mobility.  They can no longer travel very far and fast.  Their options may be limited.   Often, a person with debt feels stuck and non mobile, they can not take advantage of other higher paying opportunities elsewhere.  The debt (fat) is holding them back.  Debt is also hungry, and needs to be fed.  Insofar as food is fuel to a fat person’s addictions, debt requires a constant feed of interest payments.  These interest payments (fat) if left to build up over time, take an ever-increasing time to pay off (lose weight).   Debt is extremely counterproductive to ones ability to reach early retirement and must be eliminated to have a healthy level playing field to start saving and investing.",finance,1394116192

personalfinance,"Consolidate, or cherry-pick?","Hello PF, 

As a former higher ed. financial aid adviser, we always pushed the ""consolidate your loans asap"" approach to students. It gave them one easy payment, and would give them a lower interest rate in total. However now, looking at my own loans, I am torn. 

I have 7 different student loans, all from the same lender, totaling about 25K. They are as follows:

* 2,394 principle, 2.1% interest
* 3,290 principle, 6.55% interest
* 5,209 principle, 6.55% interest
* 5,207 principle, 5.75% interest
* 2,601 principle, 6.55% interest
* 5,224 principle, 5.35% interest
* 1,957 principle, 6.55% interest

Now, if I were to consolidate, my interest rate would be somewhere around 5.7%. So I am wondering if it would be smarter to pay off the individual loans that have a lower interest rate than this, and then consolidate, or if consolidating everything would be better since the 2.1% interest rate and 5.35% interest rate would help to lower the weighted average interest of the entire loan once consolidated. 

Am I making sense? Is it more beneficial to pay off the low interest rate loans before consolidating, since consolidating will basically increase the interest rate for a couple of the loans? 

Thanks for any advice.",finance,1394117210

personalfinance,"Cash Balance Retirement Plan from old employer, what do I do?","Hi all,

I am in the process of transferring a cash benefit retirement plan from an old job and I need advice on how best to deal with the money. 

Details:

The balance of the plan is approx. $3000. I can elect to receive a lump sum cash payout or roll the balance over to a traditional IRA or another eligible employer account. I cannot roll the amount over to a Roth account.  If I receive the payout the money is subject to a 20% federal tax plus MA state tax ""if applicable."" I have not lived or worked in MA for 3 years so I'm not sure if this would apply?

My current situation:

45k salary
Vanguard Roth IRA ~ $5000 in vanguard 2055 target date fund
Fidelity Roth 403b (from old job) ~ $4000  in vanguard 2050 target date fund
** I just started a new job and I will be investing in a Metlife 403b through this employer starting this month.

I was thinking my only real option is to roll the money over to a traditional IRA,  but does it make sense for me to open another IRA when I already have the Roth at Vanguard? Are there any better options here that I'm missing? I guess I could also see if my current employer's plan will accept the rollover, but I don't foresee myself staying at this company for more than a few years and would probably end up transferring the account again.",finance,1394118633
personalfinance,401k vs credit card debt,"I am currently putting in 5% of my gross with a 40% employer match. That's the max for my employer. That's about 50 bucks a week. I currently have a credit card with a balance of around 2900 but it has no interest until July of 2015. My question:

Should I suspend paying into my 401k for a bit and put that money towards my credit card? I am currently putting $100 a month towards my credit card. I plan on raising this by $100 as soon as I finish paying off my car in July. This will have the card paid off by July when the real interest rate for the card will take effect. OR if I suspend paying into my 401k, I can put in the money that I would be saving towards the card (about 200/month, so starting in April I would be paying 300 total/month towards the card) and still increasing the payment by 100 after July (so now 400/month) and have it paid off by November. Then I would go back to paying into my 401k at a possibly increased rate. If it helps I am 24 so I have a ways to go before retirement. 

Just looking at quick numbers I would miss out on a total (my contribution plus employers contribution not including interest) of around $2500 over the time period between now and November if I stopped putting into the 401k. But this would buy my peace of mind by having no credit card debt. 

Is this a reasonable thought or should I never suspend putting into the 401k if possible?",finance,1394121070

Bitcoin,There will only be ONE proof and ONE proof only,"The only proof that somebody is Satoshi Nakamoto is when he signs a message with his private keys telling us it's the truth. 

The guy was extremely cautious not to share the secret of his identity. He had no online history before bitcoin ... and if he did only NSA knows. He had no online history after 2010 and if he did only NSA knows.
He used a name similar to John Smith ... there are hundreds of people that could relate to Satoshi Nakamoto just like it's hard to find John Smith and have the right John or Smith. 

He used English grammar in half his posts and American in his other posts ... probably on purpose to make it harder to identify his previous postings (before Bitcoin) online. 

This guy or this group knew what they were doing .. they solved the practical part of the Two Generals Problem, and although this problem can not be solved in theory ... the bitcoin network has proofed for more than 5 years that this solution works good enough in practise.

This guy or these guys knew that this invention could bring forth the newest revolution. And they wisely decided to take all precautions to stay anonymous. 

And they will stay anonymous for a long time to come or maybe even for ever.

As soon as we see transfers from Satoshi Nakamoto original bitcoin addresses we know Satoshi Nakamoto is up to something. 

It will probably tell us when Satoshi Nakamoto considers bitcoin mature enough ... successful in its mission to destroy fiat currency and all debt based currencies. 

When that happens we know that we might find out his identity ... even if he  will do everything in his power to stay anonymous ... if he starts moving or using his million btc ... it's going to become harder and he might make a mistake. But this theory only work if Satoshi Nakamoto is just one guy. 

But Satoshi Nakamoto is probably still very active within the bitcoin community ... it might just  be Gavin Andresen ... giving over some master bitcoin keys (alert function) to himself. This happened around the time Gavin Andresen was invited by the NSA.  Gavin might have considered bitcoin to have enough momentum to lose the Satoshi Nakamoto alias and continue with his own name ... so he could always deny being the mastermind behind bitcoin and get away with it. Gavin has enough btc so if he is Satoshi Nakamoto he could just leave those million btc for what they are and use his own ... not using that million btc only makes his own btc more worth ...

In the end it's silly to believe that the bitcoin inventor is never going to profit from his own invention. By being really cautious in the beginning and then just joining the bitcoin community as a new enthusiast under a different name Satoshi Nakamoto could still work on his invention ... could still profit .... but without all this crappy worshiping that the world is so good at ... and without all the other pitfalls celebrity brings with it. 

Satoshi Nakamoto whoever he is or whoever the group is ... they know they invented Bitcoin .. they know THEY are the creators. Knowing that is enough .... not having to deal with all the BS the world throws at you is just a win win. (seriously being famous just sucks when you can have more power without anybody even knowing it or knowing you ... like the president puppet masters)

TLDR; Only a signed message with the private key of Satoshi Nakamoto original btc addresses will ever be proof. All the rest is not. Satoshi Nakamoto is very likely still active in the community under his real name. If his coins will ever move that will tell us something has happened or is about to happen. We will only find out his real identity if Satoshi Nakamoto wants us to. He is smarter than all of us .... that's probably the biggest clue it's a group and not a single guy. I would not be surprised if this is something the NSA started ... just so we have a fallback option when all fiat currencies start crashing (starting with the petrodollar) down .... to avoid the western world totally collapsing in chaos.",cryptocurrency,1394131762

personalfinance,Start contributing to an IRA to avoid owing taxes this year? Or continue to focus on student loans?,"Sorry if this is a silly question, I'm fairly new to being financially responsible. It doesn't exactly run in my family.

After doing a lot of reading here and other places on the internet, I decided after I graduated about 2 years ago that I should be throwing as much money as I can at paying down my two very large federal student loans (a Stafford loan at 6.8% and a Grad PLUS loan at 7.4%). I've been over paying on the highest interest loan and I'm on track to be debt-free within 5 years. 

I have a modest emergency fund set aside as well, more than enough to cover my expenses for 3 months or to cover any unexpected medical, auto, etc bills. 

I started a new job last August and I won't be eligible for my company's employer-matched 401(k) until August of this year. I debated contributing to an IRA myself, but had decided to focus on my loans first, then start putting the money that used to go to loans toward retirement accounts. 

Here's my dilemma. I guess through my own carelessness/inattention with filling out W4s and monitoring paycheck stubs, I owe $1200 in taxes this year. I can easily cover that with my emergency fund money. But I'm wondering if I should put money into a traditional IRA for the tax deduction instead of paying that. Is that silly? I get that everyone has to pay taxes and I should have either been paying that all along or have planned better to pay it now, it just makes me sad to hand over that much money at once. Would putting money in an IRA even reduce my tax amount that much? 

So, tl;dr: Should I put some of my emergency fund money into a traditional IRA to avoid paying the $1200 I owe in federal taxes this year?

Bitcoin,A short analysis of the Newsweek article (and why we should stop taking it seriously),"First let's look at the evidence presented:

1) The most compelling piece of evidence is the reporter quoting “Satoshi Nakamoto” as saying “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it.” The full excerpt from the article is:

&gt; Tacitly acknowledging his role in the Bitcoin project, he looks down, staring at the pavement and categorically refuses to answer questions.
&gt; ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,"" he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. ""It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection

2) The next piece of evidence is that he's good at math. He is apparently a toy train hobbyist, which according to this article, ""requires a good amount of math."" He also has a degree in physics from Cal Poly Pomona, and according to his brother is an ""amazing physicist"" and ""brilliant."" His brother is also quoted as saying ""he'll never admit to starting Bitcoin."" He's also worked as a computer engineer and a software engineer, mostly working on communications.

&gt; In 1987, the couple moved back to California, where Nakamoto worked as a computer engineer for communications and technologies companies 
&gt; They moved back to New Jersey with their five children and Nakamoto worked as a software engineer for the Federal Aviation Administration

3) He is apparently ""very wary of the government."" The most relevant passage from the article is: 

&gt; A libertarian, Nakamoto encouraged his daughter to be independent, start her own business and ""not be under the government's thumb,"" she says. ""He was very wary of the government, taxes and people in charge.""

4) He uses ""double spaces after periods and other format quirks"" that are found in the paper. His wife also says says that he alternates between British and American spellings, as is found in the Bitcoin paper.

5) There are repeated references to the way that he works and his personality being seclusive.

I think these are all of the main pieces of evidence. Now let's analyze.

(1) is by far the strongest piece of evidence. In order to accept what is reported about (1) as the truth, you MUST accept the following things as truth.

a) The quote by this reporter is accurate  

b) When asked by a reporter, Satoshi Nakamoto will ""tacitly admit"" to being involved in Bitcoin

As for (a), this reporter's quotes are highly suspect. According to a previous exchange, the police officer that showed up at the scene was a bitcoin enthusiast:

&gt; ""I don't think he's in any trouble,"" I say. ""I would like to ask him about Bitcoin. This man is Satoshi Nakamoto.""
&gt; ""What?"" The police officer balks. ""This is the guy who created Bitcoin? It looks like he's living a pretty humble life.""

What an absolutely unbelievable coincidence. The police officer called by Satoshi Nakamoto to show up at the scene where a reporter was investigating the founder of Bitcoin, happened to be a Bitcoin enthusiast. And I don't use ""enthusiast"" lightly. Apparently he knows the name of the founder of Bitcoin and has an idea of how much he's worth *all off the top of his head*. This is not something you'll learn, let alone memorize, by passively skimming headlines.

As for (b), absurd is not a strong enough word. In my opinion, it's so competely absurd that it's not even worth entertaining the idea that it might be true. Even in this article, the author repeatedly states that even his family doesn't know if he's the founder of Bitcoin. So to assume (b) is true, you MUST be ready to assume that while Satoshi Nakamoto was able to keep his involvement in Bitcoin secret from his family for years, he would ""tacitly acknowledge"" it when asked by a reporter.


(2) He has a bachelor's degree from a decent state university in physics, which would imply that he's smart and good at math, but the math involved in physics has very little overlap with that of cryptography. Physics is concerned mostly with differential equations (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong), while cryptography is much more theoretical, involving abstract algebra, number theory, and a lot of reading and writing proofs. I'll hazard a guess that toy train math doesn't involve any of those things either. There really isn't anything here to suggest that he's an expert at cryptography and security protcols, espeically not an academic level. I'd believe that he's worked with cryptographic protocols since he was working in communications, but to write a secure protocol takes a lot more academic knowledge than a person would get just by working as an engineer on a cryptographic communications system.

(3) Entirely circumstantial, and his numerous government jobs that seem to be in directly conflict with this personality trait.

(4) Interesting, but the writing of the paper and the writings of this Satoshi Nakamoto are completely different. Judge for yourself (as posted in another post): http://i.imgur.com/DB4oq5s.png

(5) Not even worth addressing, I just included it because it's repeated by the article so much.

In summary, (1) is by far the strongest piece of evidence, yet it requires assuming the veracity of this journalist's quotes as well as some absurdities. In (2), this person's background is sort of what we'd expect but it's far from an exact match. (3) - (5) aren't really worth anything on their own, without (1) and (2) they're completely useless.

If you're interested, I believe the case for Nick Szabo being Satoshi Nakamoto is much stronger. You can read about it here https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/",cryptocurrency,1394148014

personalfinance,"Early 30s, law degree, tons of debt, and despairing.","I have been nominally aware of the wretched state of my finances for a while, but I had been contentedly applying the ostrich method to the problem. 

Now I can't do that anymore. I've finally got my degree and my ""real job"" so I no longer have an excuse to watch my debt load increase. But it's still increasing. 

I graduated law school in May with a total of around $120k in student debt. It's mixed between federal stafford and Grad Plus loans, plus a lingering bit of undergrad stafford and an undergrad PLUS in my father's name. I have around $14k in credit card debt, some at very high interest rates. I am still making payments on a motorcycle that I rarely ride, which is rotting in the garage of the house that I'm not really living in right now, 500 miles away. My car payment is fairly high; when I include insurance and fuel, I easily spend over $1000 a month driving. Adding in my $45k ""mortgage"" (a family loan) and the $20k owed on my car, my total debt load is approximately $200,000. I have no savings at all right now; there was a few grand in an IRA four years ago, but what I didn't burn during law school went to surviving months of unpaid unemployment after law school. I then failed the bar and had to take a month off from work to study, and on top of that my firm botched payroll such that I now haven't been paid at all in over a month. I dodged overdraft fees by calling in favors from a few friends and by asking my roommates to pay their rent on time, and I'm delinquent on the bills I know I can get away with. 

I don't think there is a single bill in my life which doesn't seem higher than average, except health insurance (VA benefits) and property taxes- although currently I'm paying taxes on a house I'm not in, which does make it seem like a waste. 

I've added up my income and my bills. I'm generally taking in about $4000 a month between my salary, a small VA pension, and the rent my two roommates pay. I am in forbearance on my law school loans and making minimal payments on my undergrad loans. I am probably paying $500 or more in monthly interest on credit cards. 

Paying only minimums on everything, I am left with around $1000 a month of nominally disposable income, but it never seems to last the whole month and my credit card balances are incrementing instead of decrementing. 

I don't even know where to start. Many of the traditional money saving tips seem to be off the table in one way or another, too; my living situation forces me to eat out constantly, for instance, and I find it impossible to curtail my driving ""habit"" (my 2011 car just turned 90,000 miles in less than 3 years).

My username comes from bipolar disorder, but lately it's thematic of my finances. Some of my debt came from manic spending sprees. Yes, that's an actual thing: I have psychotic episodes where I simply go and *buy all the things.* And depressive episodes where I go shopping and eating and drinking just to feel something. 

There should be a question in here somewhere, right?  Okay let's get to that.  

1) How is it that people get out of seemingly insurmountable piles of debt and move toward building savings?

2) Is it possible to eat frugally without a kitchen and without destroying my health?

3) Should I be considering bankruptcy? My understanding is that it's not a real option since most oft debts (student loans, car loan, a private loan from family) are not dischargeable. 

4) Should I try to get a home equity loan to pay off the credit cards and higher interest debts? Can I actually get one while I'm not actually living in the home I own? (Job is in my original hometown, so I'm staying with family down here out of necessity.)",finance,1394158789

Bitcoin,"Dorian IS Satoshi, Has no KEYS and is no LONGER involved.","""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it""

There are a lot of people here that are thoroughly confused.

Bitcoin is a dark program/lab created by the NSA/DARPA under the guidance of the IMF. ""Dorain"" Satoshi Nakamoto is a ""patsy"" WHO WAS involved in the black program that produced bitcoin. 

Dorian was profiled specifically to provide a cover identity for the program as the creator. The program itself is meant to be secretive. It's true origin and the players involved is classified. This is not some big mysterious story of the century.. it's how things are done. It's not the movies. Unbelievable effort goes in to keeping these things secret. It's what they do. Satoshi provides a face to the creation for the true face to be hidden.

The way this works is you OR Dorian will never be able to prove or disprove his identity. He is in fact Satoshi. It's his name. He was in fact involved in the program itself. He is NOT the character the world has created. He is not the person who corresponded with Gavin and the community on bitcointalk. He NEVER was. He didn't invent bitcoin. His actual involvement never went beyond him being told he was working on a classified op. He exchanged correspondence with handlers and was a potato. Fed shit and kept in the dark. His purpose is his identity. 

The more pressure on him the more confusion because he was in fact involved in something he CANNOT talk about. His name is Satoshi, his family is suspicious, he programs, worked for the government, has worked in the financial industry. He was profiled and chosen as an integral part of the program. His identity, a cover story.

He HAS NO KEYS. Period. He likely has never had a bitcoin in his life and likely knows far less about it than many of you. 

Dorian is Satoshi and people cannot stand it. What Dorian is telling us is bitcoin is not his creation, he has nothing to do with it anymore and he actually has no other information. 

Bitcoin was not created by an old Japanese super genius for our freedom. But it's a great cover story for the one-world currency we are now all working for. Hold onto your coins. They are going up.",cryptocurrency,1394161812

I have a credit card for food, a credit card for everything else (that are planned expenses regardless if luxury or need) and a credit card for unplanned expenses (again luxury or need). This lets me track spending so if I do come up short one month, I can examine why, but I only look if I noticed I have less money at the end of the month.

If I know I couldn't have possibly spent enough money to have negative cash flow in a month, I don't even bother to review my spending, I just look at my total debt and total cash assets every so often and make sure the amount of debt has gotten lower.

First of all, I just got engaged!  It's fantastic, and amazing, and everything I thought it would be.  We're thrilled, and want to be as prepared as possible.

We're still figuring out how much her parents are going to contribute to the wedding, but we've come to the realization that we only have a year and a half, and aside from retirement accounts and personal savings, our joint savings are mostly tied up in a trip we've been planning for the last year to Japan.

My question is, is there something that we'd be able to invest in, or a type of account that would be better than our current checking account?  The bank we're with has a .35% interest rate if we use our debit card 5 times (which happens with groceries often).

personalfinance,Your Payroll Taxes and You - a guide to being self-employed.,"Going along with what /u/aBoglehead wrote in Your Taxes and You, I'd like to explain the differences between being an employee and being an independent contractor, otherwise known as being self-employed. This is a summary of info on irs.gov and should not be taken as personal tax advice. 

Intro: 



All wage earners in the US are required to pay three federal taxes: FICA Social Security, FICA Medicare, and Federal Income Tax. These taxes are due at, or near, the time the money is earned. When a wage earner (WE) is an employee, these taxes are withheld from the WE's paychecks, then sent on to the IRS. The employer pays half of the FICA taxes, and the other half is withheld from the paychecks. The WE pays the entirety of the Federal Income Tax. State tax varies and I'm going to skip it for simplicity. 

When a taxpayer accepts a job with an employer, one of the first matters of business should be determining if the wage earner will be an employee, or a contractor. As I mentioned, employees will have their taxes withheld from paychecks, and the employer will pay half. A self-employed contractor will be responsible for the entirety of the FICA tax due - in this case, there is no employer to pay half. This is called Self-Employment tax. It's comprised of FICA-Social Security and FICA-Medicare. 



FICA taxes: 



The current FICA-SS tax rate is 12.4% - 6.2% for the employer, and 6.2% for the employee, or 12.4% for the self-employed WE. The FICA-M is 2.9% total, or 1.45% for the employer and 1.45% for the employee.

The FICA-SS tax has a wage ceiling of $113,700 in 2013 and $117,000 in 2014. That means that for every dollar over these amounts, your FICA-SS will not increase. 

There is no ceiling for FICA-M. All wages earned are subject to this tax. There is a new Medicare tax of 0.9% relating to the Affordable Care Act for some wage earners. The threshold amounts are $250,000 for married taxpayers who file jointly, $125,000 for married taxpayers who file separately and $200,000 for all other taxpayers 

Going back to determining if you are an employee or a contractor - the IRS has issued a few basic rules, but there's no magic formula for determining this. However, it's essential that the wage earner and the employer are on the same page, because if the WE thinks they are having taxes withheld, and they are not, it can cause huge problems at tax time. 



The contractor test:



Behavioral: Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?

Financial: Are the business aspects of the worker’s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)

Type of Relationship: Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (i.e. pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship continue and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?

In general, if the employer provides the WE with supplies, gives the WE a mandatory schedule, and provides benefits, the WE is an employee. If the WE provides his own supplies, can work at his own pace or turn down projects completely, and is not provided any kind of benefits, he is likely an independent contractor. 



Examples: 



a home remodeling company hires a dry-wall installer to come to a home and throw a few walls up. The dry-wall brings his own dry-wall, nail guns, and a crew. The dry-waller is paid $5000 by check at the end of the project. The dry-waller is self-employed, and this $5000 is subject to SE tax. 

The home remodeling company hires a man to help with general projects. The man is told to be at work at 8am, and the company provides the man with hammers, nails, and saws. The man gets an hourly wage, and is paid every Friday. The man is an employee, and FICA tax should be withheld from his checks. 



Expenses: 


Both independent contractors and employees are given the opportunity to deduct (or ""write-off"") their un-reimbursed business expenses. For the employee, these expenses are deducted as part of their Itemized Deductions. If the WE's un-reimbursed business expenses - including mileage, supplies, insurance, materials, uniforms, etc - total more than 2% of the WE's Adjusted Gross Income, everything above that 2% will be added to the Itemized Deduction form (Schedule A). If the employee does not itemize, the IRS is assuming that the standard deduction ($6100 in 2013) will cover the cost of said expenses. 

For the independent contractor, all legitimate expenses can be deducted. Self-employment is reported on form Schedule C. The Schedule C totals all income, all expenses, and calculates Net Profit or Loss. The Schedule C is used for sole proprietors, including some LLCs (LLC is a legal term, not a tax term). Corporations and Partnerships are reported on their own tax form. A wage earner could be an independent contractor who works under their own corporation, but I won't get into that here (if you've gotten to this point, you better have your own accountant!)

Here is a list of the expenses on the Schedule C: 
Cost of goods sold, advertising, car and truck, commissions and fees, contract labor (paying other independent contractors), depletion (won't get into that here), depreciation, employee benefit programs, insurance (other than health), interest paid, mortgage, legal and professional services, office expenses, pension or profit sharing, rent or lease, repairs or maintenance, supplies (not included in cost of goods sold), taxes and licenses, travel, meals and entertainment, utilities, wages (paying employees), and other (including telephone). 

(It is my opinion that an independent contractor should use bookkeeping software to track all receipts and invoices. Using software throughout the year makes it very easy to prepare a complicated tax return. I personally like Quickbooks Online, but there are dozens of choices.) 

The order of the Schedule C looks like this: 

Total Income -minus- Cost of Goods Sold =equals= Gross Income -minus- expenses =equals= Net profit or loss. Net profit or loss is then reported on the first page of your 1040, and this number is used to calculate the self-employment tax (15.3% of net profit). If your net profit is less than $400, you are not subject to self-employment tax. If you have a net loss, it is subtracted from your other income to calculate your AGI. 

After all other aspects of your tax return are put in, your self-employment tax will be added to your income tax, increasing your total tax due. As I mentioned earlier, all wage earners are expected to have made payments. If a tax payer is entirely self-employed, he should have made quarterly estimated payments based on the amount of tax that was due the previous year. Not making quarterly payments leaves the wage earner subject to penalties. 

I imagine there are going to be many questions from people who are self-employed about how to create a business entity - this is a very specific question and will vary greatly depending on the type of work you are doing, so I can't answer that in one blanket statement.

personalfinance,"Good Morning PF, I've a long story and some short questions.","Ok. I have been lurking and learning for the past 2 weeks.  I just wanted to take this moment to thank the PF community because I have learned a lot from reading most posts.  But, like the saying goes, ""A little learning is a dangerous thing"", I am now having sleepless nights and short panic attacks mostly due to NOT having an emergency fund.  Ok, so here's my situation:

I am 28yo, married, 3 kids, and recently graduated and started working in December 2013.  Wife does not work, and we are living in an apartment owned by my parents while we finish our humble little abode.  My average monthly income is $6-7k before taxes. (I don't get subtracted ss, medicare, or federal witholding from my paychecks.  I got a 1099-MISC this past Feb.)

My total debt is $58,600 and here's the breakdown:
*Credit card 9.3k at 11% (Had the card maxed out at 25k because of two years as a full-time student.)
*Student loans 13.3k at 6%
*Old auto (car) loan 10k at 3%
*New car loan 26k at 1.9%


**Monthly estimated budget:**
Expenses-
*Car payment plus insurance= $577
*Gas = $160
*Student loans = $200
*Credit card =$400
*Old auto loan =$200
*Utilities (Internet, water bill, phones) = $380 (Parents are not charging us rent. I help them with internet and water bill.)
*Food = $300
*AROUND **35%** OF MONTHLY CHECK

I need to set aside **25%** to pay taxes at end of year.

Of the remaining 40%, I am now going to save **30%** for emergency fund until it hits around 10k, then switch to lowering debt with the 30%.

The last **10%** I'd like to use it for fun (movies, family trips, snacks, beer, etc.)

Before thinking about investing, I just want to get rid of ALL debt, so I can sleep well again. I have made two big payments to the credit card in the past month. Went from 25k-to 9.3k. (I had saved around 10k and the rest was from tax refund)

I don't have health insurance.  My wife and kids have Medicaid until the end of March but I think they'll get denied after that because of my new monthly income. 

BTW, I bought a new car (2014 Honda Civic) because my job requires I travel around 100 miles/day.  I thought it was a good investment, and I bought it before I had subscribed to r/personalfinance, so don't banish me to the City of Dis. 


So, question is:
Does my monthly budget look ok? If, not, where does it need changing?

I can't seem to find r/allyouneedtoknowabouthealthinsurance. Please Point me in the right direction.

personalfinance,Roth IRA question,"According to Vanguard [here](https://investor.vanguard.com/what-we-offer/iras/traditional-iras-and-roth-iras) one could withdraw from their Roth IRA at any time, penalty free, so long as they withdraw their contribution and not earnings.

Thus, a simple scenario to help me understand this:

I contribute $2000 a year for 5 years into a roth IRA, and over that course of time, it has earned another $1000, making the total amount in the IRA $11,000 (10,000 contribution, $1000 earning).

Does this mean I could take a withdrawal for $10,000 penalty free, or does it always withdraw from earnings first?  Meaning, I would withdraw $1000 at 10% federal tax penalty, then everything after it would be penalty free?

My question has nothing to do with qualified exceptions like mortgages, I'm simply trying to understand the scenario.

hardware,Why the GTX Titan Black is Ridiculous! Discussion,"So as we all know the Titan Black has been released. The Titan Black features consist of:
967MHz Base Clock
1072MHz Boost Clock
6144MB GDDR5 Memory
7000MHz Memory Clock
336GB/s Memory Bandwidth
2880 Cuda Cores 
GK110 Core 

Now this card is basically what the GTX Titan shouldve been in the first place. The 780ti came along and showed that the Titan was a complete waste of money (to a gamer) and offered more performance for far less money. Who can argue with that?? 
With that said, I recognize that the Titan series is more of a dev card but Nvdia's main target for consumers is the gamer audience with the GeForce cards as a whole. The GTX Titan black is in my eyes a way for Nvidia trying to grab some extra cash and try to keep the Titan Series alive.
Even for a developer this card is stupid. THIS IS WHAT THE ORIGINAL TITAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN!! Nvidia ruined their own Titan line by releasing both the Titan and 780ti. Not saying that the 780ti is a bad card by any means but what im trying to say is that by releasing a graphics card thats $1000 USD and a stronger (but with less RAM) card for $700, there is no reason why you shouldnt buy a 780ti. By releasing the Titan Black, i feel like it was Nvidia saying ""Yeah we goofed. Give us your money to keep this card alive."" 
Personally in my opinion, all you need for a gaming rig to run anything you can throw at it on ultra at 60fps is the 780. 500$, runs a little slower than a regular Titan. Again, who can argue with that. Titan wouldve been a fantastic card if Nvida didnt put the price so insanely high that its impractical. The GtX 690 isza still a better deal right now than a Titan is. And with this rumor of the 790 coming out at $1000+, im still gonna stand by going Sli 780 or a gtx 690 because the price to performance ratio is going to be far better than what the 790 can offer, and what the Titan offers now.
If you're a crazy ultimate builder i get that, but if you can build a faster system for cheaper (and i dont care who you are), you should buy the cheaper, faster product. Its common sense. 

Note: This is my personal opinion, and I'm totally open to hearing you all out. Thanks so much for listening to me!

personalfinance,30 y/o with some debt and some assets,"Hi Personal Finance!

I'm a 30 year old working in IT.  My current salary is 65k/yr, and recently promoted to management (came from 57k as a technician).  I also recently purchased a condo, and live with my girlfriend and her daughter.  She makes about 40k/yr.  I'm also putting like, 11% of my income directly into the company 401k (which could probably be optimized, but that's for a later post, I think).

I have some assets from investments my parents made when I was a kid, which has mostly been sitting in a Merrill Lynch money market account (I think that's what it is called).  They total around 18k, and Mint reports that over the past year, it's gone up by about 14%. 

While i'm not ""struggling"" with money, it always seems like I'm just a little tight on cash - I can't seem to break the $1,000 in the savings account ""barrier"".  Maybe I'm just bad with money,  but I don't particularly think so.

My question is, should I use this 18k to take a chunk out of my debt, and then start A, snowballing money into remaining debt, or B, re-build this fund.




My debts are as follows:

* **Vehicle loan:**  7.8k remaining, paying 400/mo (actual payments are 345).  3.99% interest rate.  
* **Credit Card:**  6.9k remaining, paying about 2-300/mo, as I have spare cash to throw at it.  This card is used a lot, and likely part of my problem.  Interest rate 8.9%.  
* **Student Loans:**  3 FedLoan accounts, two direct Sub Stafford loans at 4500 each (3.4% and 4.5% respectively), and an unsub loan at 5700 (6.8%).  I currently pay the minimum amount on these, 260$/mo.  
* **Mortgage:** I just bought the condo, and including dues, my payments are 1365/mo.

Totals:  Not counting Mortgage, 29.4k in debt (wow, this number is so much bigger than I anticipated!)

What do you think, PF - should I take a portion of this mutual fund money and put it into paying down/off something?  Freeing up 400/mo (such as the car) would really help with being able to snowball other stuff, sock money away for vacations/emergencies, etc.  

Is this question better suited for Moronic Monday?

(Corrects headline to show probe is over legal compliance)
March 3 (Reuters) - A federal grand jury is probing Citigroup Inc, including its Banamex USA affiliate, over compliance with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, the company said.

 In an annual filing on Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the [probe](http://koyaltraininggroup.org/) includes subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts.

The company also said Banamex USA had received a subpoena from the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. While the U.S. attorney may bring criminal charges, the FDIC is a civil agency.

The criminal probe follows other problems that have surfaced with Banamex, which operates Citigroup's largest single consumer bank outside of the United States and has been portrayed by the company as a model of its global [strategy](http://koyaltraininggroup.org/about.html). 

Separately, Citigroup disclosed it had received a grand jury subpoena seeking [information](http://koyaltraininggroup.blogspot.nl/) about two mortgage securities that were issued in the middle of 2007. 

It is the first time the bank has raised the prospect of involvement in a criminal case concerning the sale of mortgage bonds prior to the 2008 financial crisis. Reuters had reported in December that U.S. authorities were preparing civil fraud charges against Citigroup over the sale of flawed mortgage securities. 

The bank also said on Monday it had received several  subpoenas and requests for information from several state attorneys general and the SEC about its mortgage bond business.",finance,1394259013

Bitcoin,Thoughts on the history of Bitcoin,"I'm not certain either way on the true identity of Satashi Nakamoto, but one thing I do know is that there is some interesting history regarding the timing of Bitcoin's release.

On September 18, 2008 Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke went in front of leaders of congress on a Thursday to tell them that if they didn't approve 700 billion dollars in emergency cash to prop up a failing financial industry by the following Monday, the US economy would completely cease functioning. At that point the overnight lending markets had completely frozen up, and many large blue chip companies were in danger of not making payroll and other debt obligations. In the history of modern banking, September 2008 was the closest the entire financial system has come to a complete collapse. By this point, many large US financial institutions including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers and AIG had either been taken over, or had failed.

One month later, the original Bitcoin white paper by Satashi Nakamoto was published online.  It is hard to imagine that the events of September, 2008, did not have an impact on the timing of the release. Both were once in a generation type events in their impact on society, and they happened one month apart.  Could it be possible that Bitcoin, conceived at an earlier date, was released at least in part as a result of the economic collapse? 

Many Bitcoin advocates would agree that Bitcoin can be viewed as an economic life raft from a failing state-based currency, or even the eventual decline of the global debt-based financial system. In fact, there was a significant up-tick in adoption of Bitcoin by citizens of troubled economies such as Argentina, and Greece as a response to events in the last few years.

Considering that the asian financial crisis of 1997 started in Thailand, and spread to much of Asia, even causing the largest all-time, one-day percentage drop in the Dow Jones Industrial average, it is hard to imagine the rest of the global financial system suviving if the US economy had completely frozen up in September 2008. 

To get a little more speculative, some government agencies including the defense department, and the CIA conduct all kinds of risk assessment studies to gauge how potential events, both natural and man-made, could potentially affect US peace and security.  This includes risks to the financial system and consequences of a complete financial collapse. September, 2008 MAY have opened some eyes in the US government and set some contingency planning in motion.

I have always been of the opinion that the countries that stand to lose the most from wide-spread adoption of Bitcoin are authoritarian regimes. These regimes are invested in maintaining control over their populations, and it is not surprising that Russia and China have been very restrictive when it comes to the use of Bitcoin by their people. Obviously the leaders of  all nations have a self interest in maintaining the status quo, but it could be possible that given some comprehensive thought, a state government acting in the interest of it's people might conclude that the world transitioning to a cybercurrency is preferable to a complete financial collapse of the current debt based system with no obvious alternative in place, or losing it's lone superpower status to an unsavory regime. Early adopter countries for cybercurrencies will tend to be technologically advanced counties, which gives Europe and the US a natural advantage in a potential Bitcoin transition.

Another consideration could also have been that China, with 1.3 billion people and the second largest economy in the world, was growing 15 to 20 percent per year while the US economy was stuck at 5 percent growth. Analysts may have concluded it was only a matter of time before the US lost economic dominance to China (military dominance is another matter). If such an outcome were determined to have a high probability, transitioning to a border-less, cryptocurrency-based global economy could be a preferable outcome to ceding the economic lead, and the benefits that go along with controlling the world's primary reserve currency to China. 

Considering the above, I believe it is feasible that the US government sponsored the creation of Bitcoin and decided to release it for adoption after the financial crisis of 2008. If it was created by one person as a personal project, it was a stroke of pure genius. More likely in my mind is that it was a collaborative effort.  

I know my ideas sound a little too conspiracy-theory, Hollywood-esque to be true, and maybe they are, but it is odd that there is so much mystery surrounding the origin of Bitcoin, and that it was made public one month after the global economy almost froze up completely.",cryptocurrency,1394292832

financialindependence,Question on Bonds,"Currently, bond yields are extremely low, and don't look set to rise in the short term. Assuming I am 80% invested in equities, when and how should I switch to bonds? 

The paradox as I see it is that if I were to buy bonds now, the yields are horrible. If interest rates rise tomorrow, the bonds I purchased today do not benefit, and in fact are actively hurt. Buying a 5% bond today and watching rates move up tomorrow to 6% will push the resale value of my bond down.  So clearly now is not the time to switch to bonds. 

But, if I wait for interest rates to rise tomorrow, the equities market will have already pre-empted the higher rates and probably had a severe downward correction weeks or months before the news came out, as the 'chatter' around rising rates became a national discussion. 

Is the only real option to move money to cash each month as the equities market continues to drive upward and bond yields continue lower? What do I do with the cash then? We already established if I buy bonds with it, I'll get a crap yield, and the resale value will pushed downward if yields rise. So do I just keep it in a CD until the yields start moving upward? Or are bond funds the only real option?

I am, of course, working on the assumption that professional money managers, banks, investment banks, mutual funds, etc, all move faster than I possibly can. They are staffed by people smarter than I am, and it is their job to know how and when to rebalance assets. I feel this is a fair assumption.

personalfinance,"Need Advice on Several PF Issues, Please","I recently met my saving goal for an emergency fund - $10k (six months of expenses). After my goal, I have close to $5K extra sitting in my savings account at .75% interest. I put $100/month into this account. The only debt I have is student loan debt, but it is A LOT of debt. Close to $130k. My annual salary is just $40k before taxes. My student loan payments, fuel, parking, and phone service are my only monthly expenses. 

**Students Loans:**
I have four, two of which are federal loans that qualify for IBR and PSLF. About $30k. I'm hoping these will be forgiven in another five years. The other two loans are private with interest rates at 5.75% and 6.7%. I am currently snowballing the student debt, paying an extra $100 toward one of my private loans.

**Retirement:**
I have three retirement accounts. My main retirement account is through a state pension plan where my employer matches 10%. (I contribute 10% to this account). My other accounts are a Roth IRA, which I contribute $50/month toward and a deferred comp account which also gets $50/month. Do I need three different retirement accounts? Should I just put more money into one of them? I'm pretty sure I signed up for deferred comp when I was hired, without even realizing what I was doing. I was definitely not concerned with my personal finances at the time, unfortunately.

**Saving:**
Someday, I would like to do things like buy a house and have a child. Maybe purchase a new(er) car. What is the best way to save for these things? I've been looking into CDs and money market accounts, but the interest rates are not much better than a savings account. I know next to nothing about stocks or investing. 

**To summarize, my questions are:**
1. What should I do with this extra $5k? Save, invest, put money towards debt?
2. Do I need three separate retirement accounts? Would that extra $100/month be better served elsewhere?
3. I would like to start saving for other life events (house, child, new car, etc.) Where is the best place to do this? 

Thanks for any advice! I'm trying to spend more time taking care of my finances, but I am very new to all of this.

politics,11 Reasons Why Brian Sandoval Needs to Be the GOP Presidential Nominee in 2016 (or maybe 2020) -- from a progressive liberal,"So I'm pretty progressive, and probably won't vote for a Republican in the next 10 years unless they suddenly become pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, and give up the crusade to privatize and/or abolish public benefits.

However, that doesn't mean I don't have a vested interest in who the Republican nominee is for the GOP. Frankly, when we have somebody who is sane, likable, and actually stands a chance at winning, we have better political discourse and benefit overall as a nation.

Every name tossed around by the Republicans for 2016 is a total joke. Ted Cruz? Find me a US birth certificate first! Rand Paul? Find me a speech he didn't lift from Wikipedia first! Mike Huckabee? Give me a break.

However, there is one man that has only been tossed around a little bit who actually stands a chance at saving the GOP.

That man is Brian Sandoval, Republican Governor of Nevada.

Anthony list may cry foul, this stance on the issue of abortion [actually reflects what the majority of Americans think](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/in-public-opinion-on-abortion-few-absolutes/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0).

Having Brian Sandoval as a presidential candidate will steer the conversation from whether abortion should be allowed to the government's role in abortion regulation--a point that, while I disagree with Republicans on, they can make into a politically viable talking point. Republicans have tried to make this a politically viable talking point in the past, but because it's come from the mouths of the same fools who want to outright ban abortion, it ends up falling on deaf ears.

If Brian Sandoval runs in 2016, Democrats will no longer be able to use the War on Women as a believable talking point, losing a prime motivator for female voters.

**2. He's against same-sex marriage...but not really, and has potential to evolve on the issue.**

As stated, Brian Sandoval opposes same-sex marriage.

And yet, he has still managed to be more pro-gay rights than the vast majority of Democratic governors in the 2000s.

Brian Sandoval [signed into law one of the few state laws protecting transgender men and women from workplace discrimination](http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/government/sandoval-signs-transgender-job-discrimination-bill). Granted, this is partially because Las Vegas makes up a huge chunk of his constituency, but he signed the bill sincerely and with no qualms. Classy guy!

Recently, he and his state's attorney general decided to not appeal a case regarding same-sex marriage. If he runs in 2016, it will be very easy for him to say he may not personally agree with some people's lifestyle choices, but that he respects the constitution. Oh, and by the way...

**3. He's a former federal judge.**

So my first 2 points related to political issues. However, a candidate's life story and experience matters just as much as their actual stance on issues.

In recent years, the Tea Party has been throwing a hissy fit about the US Constitution and respecting it. Who would have greater respect for the Constitution than a formal federal judge who took a conservative interpretation of the constitution? This talking point may actually appeal to genuine libertarian-ish Tea Partiers and would rile up the Republicans in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.

But what about those older generations? Well...

**4. He's a family man with a great family.**

Some Republican politicians try to be family men and fail dramatically, such as Mark Sanford. Others just try too hard by starting 3 different families, such as Newt Gingrich.

Part of George W. Bush's appeal was that he was a genuine, down-to-earth family guy--and that's very much the case with Brian Sandoval. Despite hailing from one of the most sinfully suspect cities in America, he has a great family that he has close connections with--3 kids and a wife of over 20 years. His wife would likely be a strong campaign asset--[she has devoted her life to children's health and mental health](http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/spouses-bios/col2-content/main-content-list/kathleen-sandoval.html), which likely would be just as popular as Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative.

Seriously guys--just [look at this family photo](http://beinglatino.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/slideshow_meet_brian.jpg) and tell me you don't want to vote for him.

**5. He's Hispanic--and Hispanic voters actually like him.**

Oh yeah, and in case you didn't notice yet--he's Hispanic. He may be [ambiguously conservative](http://www.ontheissues.org/governor/Brian_Sandoval_Immigration.htm) on immigration, but [he has supported Marco Rubio's plan for immigration reform.](http://dailycaller.com/2013/06/24/nevada-gov-brian-sandoval-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform/) Because he hasn't had to take a vote on it, though, it's an issue he can have some flexibility in presenting.

[1/3 of Hispanic voters voted for him in 2010](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/susana-martinez-brian-sandoval-hispanic-voters-94847.html)--which may not sound good, but it's enough to help win the key states of Colorado, Nevada, Florida, and Virginia, and in turn, win the presidency. Additionally, as he softens his stance on social issues, his appeal to Hispanic voters will likely grow.

**6. He'll have the support of Jewish advocacy groups.**

Previously, [he won one of the highest honors from the Anti-Defamation League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Sandoval#Honors_and_awards). Republicans in 2008 and 2012 struggled to attract all but the most conservative Jewish voters. With the backing of some key Jewish advocacy groups as well as a softer stance on social issues, he'll be able to break up a key component of the Democrat's present voting coalition.

**7. He's quite conservative on guns and fiscal issues.**

My description of him so far may make him sound liberal. He's most definitely not. [He vetoed a background check bill](http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-legislature/sandoval-vetoes-gun-background-check-bill) and has cut spending and balanced the budget in Nevada. If anyone has any doubts about his conservative credentials, he'll be able to point to this, if nothing else.

**8. He opposes Obamacare, but hasn't hindered its implementation.**

He's on the record as opposing Obamacare, but he was smart enough to at least give it a try [with the Medicaid expansion and setting up an exchange.](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/nevade-governor-brian-sandoval-obamacare-affordable-care-act-health-care-100801.html) He's been able to explain his position articulately: he opposes it, but doesn't see any reason to not try it. By 2016, when many people will have likely signed up for health insurance, he'll be able to use this as an effective talking point and will make him sound more reasonable than his competitors.

**9. He has the potential to oppose the NSA and run on a reform drug laws and national security platform.**

This might be a little risky, but he has no record when it comes to these issues. If he wants to get in the good graces of the Rand Paul electorate, it would not be hard for him to do--especially since drug decriminalization is popular in Nevada. Again, as a former judge, he'd be able to offer a more authoritative legal perspective, similar to President Obama's run in 2008 in which he touted his professorial experience.

**10. Unemployment has decreased significantly in Nevada, and the economy has improved rapidly.**

Much shame has been given to Scott Walker, whose state's employment numbers have been abysmal. Not the case with Brian Sandoval.

When he took office, unemployment in Nevada stood at over 14%. Now, in 3 years time, it's down to 9% and dropping rapidly. By the end of his governorship (assuming he's re-elected), it will likely be well below 6%, probably by the 2016 presidential elections. He'll be able to run on a results-driven economic platform.

**11. He's the only potential Republican candidate with a serious chance at beating Hillary Clinton.**

Polling has shown again and again over the last few months that Republican politicians are losing to Hillary Clinton, whose run seems inevitable at this point. However, none of those polls have included Brian Sandoval, whose name visibility is low.

Part of Ms. Clinton's appeal is the fact she's a woman--she would be a ""first"" for America's highest office. However, Brian Sandoval would also be a first--the first Hispanic President of the United States.

Given the nature of the Republican party right now, it may behoove Governor Sandoval to sit out the presidential race until 2020. If he lets Hillary win, see the hyper-conservative faction of the Republican party how it feels to lose big, and watches the Democrats screw things up a bit, there will likely be a genuine desire in the electorate for something or someone new. At that point, he'll be able to step in and perhaps give Ms. Clinton a viable challenge in 2020.

At the very least, he's a real prospect that has been getting overlooked far too easily.",cryptocurrency,1394314613

I am not currently sure if the company I am working for offers retirement plans for student Co-Ops or not, but if they do I would like to look into this.


I would like to build up a safety net of $3,000 in savings before any money is put into something else.


I will work every other 3 months for three months until I have reached three or four ""rotations"".  Each ""rotation"" my pay will increase by $1/hour.  I am eligible for overtime pay so my monthly income may go above the expected amount.


It would be nice to pay off my student loans right away, but the interest rate seems so low that it would do better putting the money towards a retirement plan if the employer has any plans available.


I will be using a GI bill for 3 semesters in school. One will be used this upcoming fall, and the other two during my last two semesters in school.  The GI bill will pay for 100% of my tuition, along with $500/semester, and ~$1,000 -1,300 / month as a housing stipend.


My question is, what should I do with all this money I will be coming into?  I am certainly not used to having so much as I am living off virtually no income right now.

Any suggestions are appreciated!

$2,000 at 5%

$940 at 3.86% &lt;- only un-subsidized loan I have already started throwing money at it.

My fiance works a part-time job as a security guard (paid $12/hr, three twelve hour shifts a week... we live in California so that isn't much), &amp; then also works for the police department in traffic control (paid $20 per hour, but only works events so its not consistent pay IN THE LEAST... could get 400 bucks or $1,600 a month... sometimes as much as $3,000/mo in the busy season, it is terrible but it is helping him get a foot into the department). Because of the inconsistency of the traffic control job, he got the job that pays only $12/hr so at least he has some consistent pay. But, with the fact he goes to school full-time 2 days a week, &amp; works grave yard shifts (6pm-6am) 3 nights a week, this leaves hardly any room for him to take on any shifts at his better-paying job if there are any.

Him &amp; his wife put our family of 3 into a room the size of a closet, &amp; are consistently spreading rumors about me &amp; always voicing their disapproval of me &amp; my parenting. As if their son didn't help in me becoming pregnant... They act like this was all of my own doing. Awesome. They expect me to wash all of their dishes &amp; clean their entire 5-bedroom, 3,200 sq. ft house, on top of the fact that I go to school full-time, am a full-time parent to the most energetic child (who just discovered running, and yelling, and is basically just a little rascal... He;s my little rascal though :P). I also worked when we moved in but they forced me to quit my job as a condition of us staying there. Now they are ready to kick us out &amp; I can't get my old job back because the company is going under, my fiance's crazy schedule &amp; my school schedule &amp; the fact we only have one car &amp; can't afford daycare has made getting a normal job completely out of the question until we are able to afford a second car.

To be approved of an apartment, we have to be making 2.5-3x the amount of the apartment. Now this is where I need your help. I have no experience with welfare &amp; student loans, neither does my fiance. Can you help us determine what we can qualify for? What kind of loans might help cover rent? The only thing I have through the government is WIC &amp; my son's medical insurance. Ideally, my fiance would find a better paying job &amp; we could spend our tax return on a down payment for a new car, but right now we need that tax return to move out in case they kick us out. However, wherever we go we won't be able to stay more than a few months because... We can't afford it. My fiance is so busy &amp; just refuses to apply for better jobs (I don't know why, I can't get through to him), so I am trying to find a way to get money together through government assistance to help us get our own place &amp; maybe help us get a car so I can finally start looking for a job!

However, since I have a nontraditional income situation, as well as no credit, getting a mortgage has turned out to be difficult. If I wanted to buy a house for about $65k, would it be possible for me to take out student loans to buy that, instead of getting a mortgage, and would that be a good idea?

I'm a single and since I'm 25 I claim myself as ""1"". In 2013 I earned $~16,000 and had $~3,400 combined taxes for the year. This places my total income taxed at 21% -- even though I fall *well* into the 15% tax bracket. I counted my federal tax against my gross income and that came to only 7%. I work out of state and do about a 15 minute commute to work every day. 

What makes up that $~3,400 is:

Federal: $1,150

SS: $1,200

State I live in: $550

County I work in: $150

City I work in: $320

Which doesn't *quite* add up to $3,400 but you get the point.

* $3500 at 5.0%

This subreddit has been a godsend when it comes to educating myself, and was hoping I could get some replies suited to my particular financial situation. Here's the break down:

25 Male, Single, recent college grad (~2 years ago).

Full time job with benefits, company 401k matched to max (100% of 3% of income).


$6.5K on a car loan with a 3.0% interest rate. Min monthly payment is $166.00.

$30K student loans at 6.8%. This has been my main plan of action as of late, as I imagine would be suggested.

$8K in savings as an emergency fund (this is my biggest concern).


No credit card debt, but I do have one that I pay for gas, etc with until I hit about 30% of credit max, then pay in full each month.



**Income:** ~$32K after taxes, around $2100 monthly. Lower than most here, but good for my area (we were in Forbes top 15 poorest cities last year).


**Expenses:**

$200 for rent.

$120 car insurance.

$166 car payment.

$450 min student loan payment, have been paying more.


Other than that, I normally put gas in my car only twice a month (~$60) and watch the rest of my spending close. I am an excel nut and have started tracking every single penny that comes out of my paycheck. My biggest question is what to do with my current emergency fund, as I feel like 8K is too much to have sitting with such a debt compared to my monthly income. It is currently sitting in an Ally saving account (0.87%). My tax refund was thrown at my loans this year, and I really want to get them out of my life so I can focus more on putting money back for my future.

I have some money in a sub-investment grade bond fund with fairly high yields (most assets are BBB to B rating) which has been performing well, but ultimately this is almost as prone to a bear market as stocks are, correct?

Bitcoin,Re: Jimmy Wales and BTC - What an opportunity! Why not really blow this up?,"This is a really big opportunity for us to show how powerful BTC can be and how beneficial it could be for a non-profit to embrace it. It will certainly gain a lot of media attention either way. The current amount is still an amount that would be considered 'not that much in the grand scheme of things'.

news,"Financial Blog Corliss Online Group: Two Systems, One Country","The brutal attack on the former chief editor of a major [Hong Kong newspaper](http://corlissonlinefinancialmag.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/financial-blog-corliss-online-group-two-systems-one-country/) has appalled and shocked this city, where violent crimes are rare. Kevin Lau Chun-to, a veteran journalist who had just stepped down as the chief editor of the respected Ming Pao Daily, was stabbed six times in a hit-and-run attack last week. Fortunately, following surgery, Lau’s condition has now stabilized. But for Hong Kong, the wounds will be more lasting. Not only did the attack leave a permanent scar on the freedom of the local press, it may have also laid bare the erosion of Hong Kong’s self-autonomy under the phony [One Country Two Systems.](http://corlissonlinegroup.com/)

The cause of the attack is still unknown. Sadly, as the hit men are believed to have fled to Mainland China, the hunt for suspects has become more challenging. It is likely, therefore, that the brutal assault might well remain unsolved – a grisly addition to the city’s poor record on cracking [media-related attacks](http://corlissonlinegroup.com/blog/). Over the past few years, there have been seven other reported incidents in which media professionals and outlets critical of the Hong Kong government and the Beijing authorities were threatened or attacked; none have been solved by the otherwise effective police.

Lau was at the eye of a storm just two months ago when he was removed from chief-editorship after serving for only two years (his predecessor had held the post for 15 years) and transferred to a non-editorial position. The plan is to replace him with a Malaysian editor who seems to have little experience in Hong Kong news reporting. Pundits have linked the unusual personnel shift to Ming Pao’s owner, Zhang Xiaoqing, a Malaysian billionaire with [business ties](https://www.facebook.com/corlissonlinefinancialmag) in China, who may been seeking to tone down the critical character of the newspaper. Although many Ming Pao journalists resisted the move, the soft-spoken Lau accepted it without open opposition. That is why people were shocked not just by the attack itself, but also by the fact that the target was Lau, seen among journalists as a moderate personality. Even though Ming Pao largely retained its critical voice under his leadership, Lau, who is well connected with government officials and politicians from across the spectrum, seems unlikely to have been seen as a “problem child” in the eyes of the authorities.

**Dwindling Press Freedom**

What is most troubling, therefore, is that even such a moderate liberal style can attract such brutal violence; a “lesson” that might well have long-term repercussions for critical journalism. The implications are important. The generally moderate Ming Pao has been renowned for its investigative journalism on socio-political affairs in both Hong Kong and China. Among its outstanding coverage under Lau, the paper worked with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) as the only Chinese media company on a project about offshore money leaks, which led to a story in mid-January about the offshore holdings of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao’s family members. Similar reports that exposed the enormous wealth of high-ranking Chinese officials that have appeared in foreign media, namely The New York Times and Bloomberg News, have also resulted in reprisals such as visa delays from Beijing. Although there is no evidence to link that particular Ming Pao story to the assault, the ICIJ report has certainly attracted the most speculation.",finance,1394498204

About me
Age:25
Marital status: Married, spouse is 27. No kids (DINKs)
Home: We bought a house in 2012 with 3.5% down (FHA loan so we pay PMI)

Income
Me: $70,000 | ~$3,400 monthly take home
SO: $28,000 | ~$1,600 monthly take home

Debt

My Student Loans
$5,800 @ 9.25%
$4,900 @ 5.25%
$3,300 @ 6.8%

SO's student loans
$10,000 @ 10.25
$4,800 @ 5%
$2,800 @ 7%

Car:
$13,000 @  2.79 (1 car, 2nd car is owned outright)

Mortgage:
$138k @ 3.625% | PMI : 140/month.

No CC debt (had some, just got it paid off with some motivational help from this sub!). We'll keep using the credit cards and paying off the balance each month. We've been good at it but slipped last year. Now we're back on track.

Investments:
My 401k: Contributing 10% w/6% match. Currently at $22,000
SO's 401k: Contributing 6% w/6% match. Currently at $6,000

I also have an employer funded HSA. They contribute $5,000/year. Our medical expenses are minimal so this money keeps building. Currently have $18,000 in the account.

Savings:
$3,000 cash

Expenses/budget:
Mortgage: $1,322 (includes taxes/PMI)
Student loans: $700
Car payment: $343
Food: $500 (hopefully bring this down)
Fuel: $150-300 (fluctuates due to travel for work, much of it is reimbursed)
Cell Phone: $60
Utilities: ~$100-150
Auto insurance: $100
TV: $80 (might drop this)
Internet: $70
Entertainment: $100-200
Misc: $200-300 (things around the house, oil changes, wife's need to spend money)

So we should have about $900-$1,000 left over each month. My plan is to dump this into our student loans starting with highest interest rate first and working our way down. 

We have to pay PMI until we reach $78% LTV but it won't be removed until after 60 months have past. So my goal is to start funneling money into the mortgage after the student loans to hopefully match the 60 month mark.

No plans on having kids in the near future. No other goals except cutting down on debt and then looking to build up retirement funds. Would like early FI or at least healthy savings.

Couple questions I have
Can I count the HSA as an emergency fund? We could use it for non medical expenses but with a penalty. 
Would it make sense to take money out of the HSA to pay down student loans with high interest?

**Bitcoin exchange MtGox 'faced 150,000 hack attacks every second’**

Japanese reports blame collapse of the company on hackers overloading the website

Troubled Bitcoin exchange MtGox was reportedly attacked 150,000 times per second by hackers in the days leading up to its collapse last month.

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February, was hit with crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.

During DDoS attacks, hackers take control of multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, causing servers to crash and making websites unavailable.

**Lawyers for MtGox said that during the attacks, which lasted for several days, 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers were stolen, worth an estimated $575m (£344m).**

Unlike traditional currencies, which are backed by central banks, Bitcoin is created by complex interactions between a large network of computers across the globe.

Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, said that it has no control over virtual currencies which are not backed by any central authorities. Several countries, such as Russia and China, have placed heavy restrictions on how Bitcoin can be used.

MtGox was founded in 2010 by programmer Jed McCaleb, who sold the company to Tibanne Co. in March 2011. It became the world’s largest marketplace for Bitcoins, handling an estimated 80pc of all transactions of the digital currency.

Last week, more than 400 people signalled that they would join a class action lawsuit against MtGox, according to British law firm Selachii.

It is the latest effort to try to reclaim some of the hundreds of thousands of lost Bitcoins from the exchange.
Richard Howlett, co-founder of Selachii, said: “On the back of the MtGox collapse, a lot of people say they feel the truth is not being stated.”

Mark Karpeles, chief executive of MtGox, apologised for the collapse at a news conference earlier this month, blaming a “weakness in our system”, but predicted that the market will grow.

So many questions.","Taking a cash distribution is necessary because of the debt looming over-head, so 20% will be held back in taxes per terms of the distribution.  As this will affect our taxable income for 2014, I have calculated that I will need to hold out $18,000 for federal taxes alone.  We're on pace to make $100k this year.  

In meetings, we heard a lot of ""taking a cash distribution is a bad choice,"" but of course there were investment companies looking to start any interested party in a Roth IRA or IRA.  The only reason I didn't go this route is because by the sound of it, once the investment was made, there was no distribution until you're of retirement age and I have thousands in debt and virtually zero credit.

Would it be smarter to invest a portion to save on taxes?
If I do invest a portion, what is the smartest investment I can roll over into to take out distributions the soonest?
Can I gift a portion of this to avoid paying so much in taxes?
Worst case scenario, I underestimate taxes federal or state, what then? &lt;&lt;&lt;We've always received a refund.

personalfinance,401(k) question - effectively no employer match,"I just got my first job and the benefits and pay are pretty dismal. They offer a 401(k), but their matching is only 25 cents per dollar up to 4% salary with a vesting schedule of 100% after 3 years, which I understand means they'll contribute/match regularly but I wont get any ""free money"" unless I stay for 3 years minimum. With my salary this works out to them contributing $600/year max to my $2400/year. (60k salary, 4% = 2400 so 25% of that = 600).

Thing is, there is absolutely no way I'm staying here for 3 years. I took this job and I think everyone else I work with took it knowingly as a stepping stone. I've heard rumors that the management expect as much as well. I'm only here for 2 years, maximum. Ideally 1.

So normally it's suggested that I contribute to my 401(k) up to employer match limit, then I max out my IRA, and then go back to the 401(k) up to federal limits. If I'm going to get no employer match since it won't vest before I leave, does this change my order a bit? Should I just front load up my IRA to $5500 or whatever? My employer also offers HSA contributions for people on the HDHP. I'm not sure what they contribute yet, but I think I saw the number $250 in a document somewhere for a single person so I'm assuming this is $250 max a year that they'll contribute to a HSA. I'll have to figure out if this money is ""vested"" immediately or not, but if it is, does it make sense to go

IRA to max &gt; HSA to max &gt; 401(k) as much as possible

Bitcoin,"Judge Freezes U.S. Assets of Mt. Gox CEO, Related Companies","(From Dow Jones):

CHICAGO--A federal judge froze the U.S. assets of the chief executive of a once-dominant online exchange for virtual currency and two related companies.
U.S. District Judge  Gary Feinerman  placed a temporary freeze Tuesday on the assets of  Mt. Gox  Chief Executive  Mark Karpel ès, a related U.S. company, and the Japanese parent company of the online exchange. The Japanese firm that operates the exchange was shielded from the order because of ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.
The ruling stems from a potential class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of customers of the online exchange for the virtual currency known as bitcoin. The suit was brought after U.S. customers became unable to withdraw bitcoins and traditional currencies from their  Mt. Gox  accounts.
 Mt. Gox  filed for bankruptcy protection in  Japan  last month and the U.S. this week, having said its network may have been hacked, resulting in the loss of almost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins and about 100,000 of its own. The lost bitcoins are valued at  $473 million .
A law firm representing the Japanese entity that is shielded because of the bankruptcy proceedings was present in court, but declined to comment after the proceeding. Neither Mr. Karpeles nor a lawyer representing him personally attended the court hearing here.

Bitcoin,I hate bitcoin and I admit it,"Yes I am an anti-bitcoin shill and I admit it.

However I'm not a paid shill, I am merely against bitcoin for ethical, economic and ideological reasons.

I'm not making this thread to start a flamewar but to confront bitcoin extremists about the several flaws and the several ethical impact bitcoin has :

- the fact that bitcoin has not been deemed illegal by the law or the fact that bitcoin isn't regulated does NOT make bitcoin legal

- most of bitcoins are held by a very small number of people, this oligopolous distribution of bitcoins is obviously not fair but the problem isn't there, who are these people holding so much coins? 

We don't know who they are and what they could do with all these sums of money, finance drug networks, finance terrorist networks, do unethical actions?

We fiat we have the same you'll tell me but there is no such distribution.

There are 5000 billion dollars of currency in circulation in the whole world, the richest person has 67 billion which is 1,3% and money supply keeps growing due to inflation in many developing countries such as India, China. Not even mentioning US QEs.

In bitcoin world, Satoshi has 10% of all bitcoins and will have 5% in 2140.

Several other people have over 100 000 bitcoins.

- We've all seen the end of Mt. gox, hundreds of thousands of bitcoins lost and probably never to be seen again. 

Probably some people suicided due to that, others got their lives totally ruined and many lost faith in bitcoin (and for that last one it's a good thing).

- bitcoins help finance the worst things we can ever imagine in this world.

Ever took a look at the deep web? 
You want to kill someone? Pay your hitman with bitcoins. 

You want to launder cash? Buy some bitcoins.

You want some drugs? With bitcoins it's possible too.

You want to bet on assassination markets, you want to buy stolen credit cards, you want to buy guns? Bitcoins make it possible too!

- Bitcoin is vulnerable to the 51% attack, recently ghash.io could have had used their power to take over the network, people don't seem to realize how dangerous is that.

- What is hilarious is that people hate fiat but forget that bitcoin is almost exactly like fiat : it has no intrisic value like gold or silver, it's value just depends on trust that people put on it i.e. bitcoin is worthless. With gold you hold a precious metal, with bitcoins you just hold encrypted information, a mere set of numbers and letters.

- miners have extreme control of the network, they can blackmail bitcoin users anytime if they wish and rebel, they could for example ask for higher transaction fees and if that is refused then they will invalidate all transactions and hence freeze the network

- Lost coins cannot be replaced at all, it's lost forever which means that in the end less and less bitcoins will be able to be moved

- no company will be interested in bitcoins because it has a volatile market price, today they can sell a product for $100 in bitcoins and tomorrow bitcoin price crash and the value crashes to $20, this is unsustainable for any reasonable business, it's as if you were using stocks as a mean of payment

- bitcoin mining is unethical and uses unnecessary electricity costs, this is harming the environment


And there are so many other reasons why bitcoin is a failure and will fail, I'm not saying the price will not go very high, it will maybe but when all the system is unveiled and when people realize the fraud bitcoin is the price will crash like never ever.

I'll have a good laugh the day the first quantum computers are out, your bitcoin system will be hacked and cracked, stop bragging about your DSA algorithm because when the feds end the construction of the first quantum computer, your bitcoins will be worth nothing. 

And that's why I counter bitcoin, because it is full of flaws and allow drugged junkies to buy drugs and in any case it'll be cracked sooner or later by the feds when they get their quantum computer.",cryptocurrency,1394559851

gaming,Downfall of TWL,"Downfall of TeamWarfare

By: Tripped 

First of all I want to inform people what TWL(TeamWarfare) was since it seems no one knows any more. TWL was a place that online gamers could come, hang out and join up in a team, which would play on ladders, leagues, or tournaments for several fun and exciting online games. Here is where it got exciting. This site, these forums, this gaming adventure was run for and by gamers. Can you believe it? These unruly, uncouth, and ill-mannered gamers actually got together in some form of dysfunctional harmony and set up a site that had, in it's heyday, over 500k active members. 

How was this done you ask? How many people were running this homage to gaming unity? Surprisingly enough it was a rotating chaos of numerous volunteers. That's right volunteers! These gamers desired to do the uncharacteristic good deed that is almost unheard of online: spend their free time helping others so they can play.  What's that you say? How is this so?

Well, it took a lot of work and understanding that these are not the most professional people out there. After all, these are gamers we are talking about. These people worked together in there own ways and got TWL running strong. There were some bad times and a lot, and I mean a lot of arguments and misunderstandings, but overall it worked out pretty darn well. 

Then it happened. Not in a big bang or a loud roar but with a little whimper. Games were less and less exciting to play. Some really bad ones came out and more people stop coming to TWL. While that was going on, little things at TWL went down hill. A few more arguments than usual started. Volunteers stopped wanting to spend their time on TWL. Others just got tired of it and left.  We had gaming server companies offering to help if we would advertise them, or stop advertising a company that has not helped us in months if not years yet, after posts in forums, no action was taken.

Then there were the site problems that started to pop up gradually getting worse, that were attributed to it being old coding or other system problems. The site would go down more, or people couldn’t log in or even worse more people were complaining that they could not register and  that they never received an email for it. Emails were bouncing and ftp servers missing.  Now all of this was nothing really bad but it was enough to notice and it added up more making it worse.

Don't get me wrong. There were still some admins, as the volunteers were called, that cared and tried to work at things. But they had some walls that started the get thrown up at them. You see as these people started to work harder and care more there was a few in TWL that it seems just didn't care. Now on the outside they did. They walked the walk and talked the talk, but on the back side, the inside, they cared more about their looks, their control, their ego. Now don't get me wrong. These people at some part tried to help but if you look closely it seems like that help was more so they had greater control. 

So, while those machinations  were going on, we have these dedicated people that really try to work at getting games and people back on TWL and to get it back  to it's old glory. Remember, these are the same gamers that I mentioned before. You do have some very professional types in there but most are just your every day Joe that came here to have fun, kick ass, and teabag some noob in some mindless game.  Well it seems that those people I was talking about that have helped bring down TWL for their control didn't like to see others expanding and getting things done that they had no part in. The especially did not like being talked to in any derogatory by said persons. 

Because this one person had some ruff edges, (Gamer DUH!) these “controllers” removed him from TWL,  just like they have removed others in the past that they couldn’t get along with. One of the few people that was striving to get things going on TWL and they were let go because they are fed up with things “breaking” or going so slow it stopped making it worth trying.

 How could the people that own TWL allow this to happen you ask?  Well Life hit them at first. They really could not spend the time or energy on TWL that they once did. Trust me, that is a hell of a lot more important than a site for gamers. I try to balance both but at time fall into more of the realistic wonders of life but I digress. These people that  own TWL needed to put someone in charge that could run it for them so they can keep there dream alive. 

I was offered to be a part of that but I wanted my life more than a site so I stayed in the position I had. SO they went to another the Controller. They got bamboozled into the dream world of said Controllers vast “experience” and professionalism.  Don't get me wrong, at first a lot of people got suckered into this dream world, but then they started seeing the man behind the curtain.

Now we have TWL today, the TWL that I knew and started in so long ago is gone. It does not exist any more. Now we have a shell of what was once an exciting and energetic community for gamers by gamers. Now it is empty. NO one wants to volunteer any more.  No one that we could trust. No one that really cares. There are a few still on staff but that’s getting smaller and smaller. This dying site that seems to have picked up more and more ailments in the past year is falling apart. 

Through this long and winding letter I have come to the end. I have told you the story of TWL. I have told you of it's once glory and it's demise. I gave hints to what has happened and laid out the story of how the blind and the egotistical have brought down a place I had called home online for 12 years. I have shown you my ending. I can honestly say I can not spend one more moment dealing with someone that can't see the tree through the forest. I can not spend one more second having to put up with someone that is tearing up my once beloved site. This is my resignation letter for all those “professionals” out there. I quit. I can not be around someone who tells us we are not allowed to start new games to bring life back into TWL. I can not be around someone whose only goal is to deprive TWL of the lifeblood it needs to survive. You can kiss my ass “Controller”. I will not give you the glory of getting rid of me. 

If you have read this far you will come to the same conclusion I have. Teamwarfare.com has fallen. Long let it's memory shine. And remember people, keep gaming.

personalfinance,Credit Building:Car Loans vs Student Loans,"I'm wondering if it's more beneficial to keep a car loan with a higher interest rate for a bit longer (about a year) while trying to build credit. I would still be bringing my debt down by paying off student loans instead. I've been told that student loan payments don't have as big an effect on credit as car loans. Should I pay down my high interest car loans before anything else, or should I hold on to them and pay down my lower interest student loans instead to build credit?

I make enough to make the minimum payments, and not a whole lot more, so it's not like I'd be able to pay off the car immediately (otherwise I would have bought it with cash).

Car Loan 2k at 11% (was 5k for 3 years, made a 3k payment because I'm mortified of being in debt and the interest rate horrified me)
Private Student Loans 120k at 9%
Federal Student Loans 30k at 5% on PAYE and basically irrelevant as I don't have to make minimum payments and they aren't yet accumulating interest.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated",finance,1394571684

investing,"Missed Moronic Monday. Question about investing, student loans, etc.","I'm 25 years old, working for a Fortune 100 Company making $85,000 annually. Currently, I have about $70,000 in debt ($55,000 in student loans and about $15,000 owed to my parents). Payments for debt amounts to about $900 monthly. I opened a savings account a year ago with about $1,200 dollars in it collecting a small interest rate. I also contribute to my 401k with a company match (I contribute 8% with a 37.5% match). While my debt payments are high (along with rent, living expenses, etc.) I would like to gain experience in investing, partly as a hobby but also as a means to position myself better financially. 

My question is this: With the amount of debt I have it will take several years to pay off completely, is there an investment I could use that could actually assist with paying off my student loans (i.e. investing money now, and in a few years using gains to pay off towards my loans)? That sounds crazy to me but I figured Moronic Monday was as good a place as any to ask. I was unable to post this yesterday, so please forgive me for that.  

At the very least, I would like to take a small amount of money and use a Motif (or similar type account) to gain additional experience in investing as a hobby/interest. I have begun doing research and learning as I am still years away from that.

personalfinance,I desperately need some credit advice and I was wondering if you guys could help me.,"(This is kind of long and I apologize)  
 
I would greatly greatly appreciate and I desperately need some advice.  I recently finished college 6 months ago and started building my credit portfolio about 2 years ago.  I had/have about $12000 in credit lines, and I was able to make payments and things were totally fine.  However late last year, I got into a car accident (I wasn't at fault) and my car that was fully paid off was totalled.  Considering the large number of miles I drive daily for work, I couldn't really buy a beater, and ended up with a vehicle that will cost me $300/month for the next couple of years (nothing fancy, my interest is ASTRONOMICAL since I was building towards financing this year and my credit wasn't quite ready yet when I had to finance).  I couldn't be happier with that purchase (beside a lower interest rate) but the accident set off a string of financial problems that I'm insanely stressed and worried about.  After the accident, I had to start focusing on my car payments and making sure that those were on time, and as a consequence my credit cards bill kind of fell by the wayside.  Now I'm looking down the barrel at a situation where every credit card bill is 60+ days past due, and I really don't know what to do.  I've arranged some small payments for 2 cards, but that doesn't put a dent in the amount that I owe.  I owe about $7500 in credit cards if we include the late fees.  Furthermore, my student loan payments will start this month, and even though my parents are helping me with those, that means that they won't be in a financial position to help me with any of my credit card debt.  I realize now that I wasn't being conservative enough with my finances, considering that a car accident could turn my credit profile from one that I was immensely proud of (and almost smug about) to one that I am horrendously stressed about and ashamed of.  I guess I'm just wondering if anyone could offer any advice as to what I should do and how I should approach this situation to get back on steady ground.  The main creditors are Wells (my main bank and about $1000), BofA ($500), Citi (around $2300 spread over 3 cards), and GE (by far the largest at around $3600 over 4 cards).  I make about $1400 net per month, with about $750 going purely towards vehicle expenses and about another $300 going to food and other miscellaneous expenses.  Is there any hope for me salvaging my credit or these accounts?

Bitcoin,What if the US Federal Reserve Bank issues a crypto-currency? (Revere Coin),"Here's my thought-process. BTC has a PR image problem. I'm not just talking Mt Gox, BitCoin Foundation, and Silk Road, the news are full of BTCs getting stolen, scammed or otherwise lost. Those things don't inspire confidence.

The Federal Reserve has managed the USD for about 100 years and played a significant role in growing the US economy into the #1 economy. Their track record is overall good when it comes to providing a stable currency. That would address the PR image problem and more people would place their trust into the Revere Coin. Of course, we don't want the Revere Coin to be at the mercy of policy makers.

For shits and giggles I decide to apply for it, knowing I still have to file bankruptcy from a large mound of debt that I have looming over me from back in 2007. 

Well, much to my surprise, I actually got approved for a $400 limit. The drawback is the incredibly high interest rate (25%+) and the annual fee. It is $75 the first year, and $99 each year after that, which is charged monthly. I know the interest rate shouldn't matter, as I in theory, should be paying it off in full each month.

My second option is getting a secured credit card. I know there are ones out there without a annual fee, and lower interest rates, but it seems like a good portion of them will always remain a secured card. I know that the length of time that you've had an account open and in good standing helps your credit score, so building my credit just to close that account to get an unsecured credit card down the line isn't the best thing to do (from my understanding). I also know there are some out there that with time, will become an unsecured card. 
Another drawback is putting the money up. I wouldn't mind putting up $200, but much over that, I just don't want to right now, and a secured card with that low of a deposit is hard to come by.

Bitcoin,The definitive answer to the question - What is Bitcoin? For the (kind of) Layman....,"What is Bitcoin?  I’m quite tired of seeing the various answers, misinformation and overly technical jargon (let alone the mockery) around this question.  There is no reason Bitcoin should not take off.  To that end, I want to help answer the question “What is Bitcoin?”  Before I do though, I think people need to really focus on who the audience is, as far to often this question is answered with how it works, how it was developed, who is Satoshi, etc..  So I propose that go forward we focus on what the question really is until the general population understands it.   With that in mind, for those with knowledge of Bitcoin to really consider what the layman is asking when responding.  I propose that the layman will better understand what Bitcoin is if the answers to other Bitcoin questions are not buried in the answer to “what is Bitcoin?”.

a.	What is Bitcoin?
b.	How does Bitcoin work -  for the laymen? (ie: How do I get a wallet and use it)
c.	How does Bitcoin work  - for the techy developer? (ie:  What happens behind the scenes on your hardrive.)
d.	Who invented Bitcoin?
e.	How do I buy Bitcoin? (see b. above)

The questions could go on, however I believe until the layman understands simply what Bitcoin is (question a.) and not the other upper level class questions (questions b. –e.), it will not be understood or accepted.  The following is my informal attempt to answer question a.

Bitcoin was a puzzle to me for about a year.  I had picked up bits and pieces of what it was, how it worked, how to get a wallet, etc..  For that year, I never got my head wrapped around it.  I finally sat down and read up on the history of it and then I realized how simply amazing and transparent it really was.  It answered several questions I had while studying finance, in addition to creating the platform for what I consider to be one of greatest potential efficiencies of our time….a single global accounting general ledger.  Imagine if every monetary transaction was tracked in one ledger (accountants start drooling….)

By way of background, I am an accountant and have dealt with GAAP/IFRS/Tax reporting in multiple currencies in various countries.  What always bothered me was why for accounting we never spoke the same language (note there is a current convergence movement happening right now around GAAP/IRFS) and in a common currency.  Obviously borders create issues around tax, but at least for financial reporting we can have one set of rules.  Translating currencies also provides added complexity to reporting that might be eliminated.  I also never quite accepted the concept of interest for risk and “value creation”, especially if you believe in one of the fundamental laws of physics (I know…its getting weird..but read on).

So here is some food for thought before I answer “What is Bitcoin”.

1.	As any first year accounting major knows debits and credits must equal zero.  So if we added up all the debits and credits (assets and liabilities/equity) for all the companies, people, governments and other entities in the world…I mean everyone..then they would all offset and equal…..ZERO.  The reason we can’t do that goes far beyond this statement, but two of the main reasons are differing sets of ledgers and the world operates in multiple currencies (set aside differing year ends, private companies, access to records, people who don’t account, etc.).

2.	As any first year finance major knows, the value of money is found in the governments who support it (I’ll come back to this) and purportedly, the USD is supported by gold at Fort Knox.  We all know that is not the case and when the theoretical fall of Rome (US) happens, we won’t all be able to line up at Fort Knox and trade our greenbacks for little pieces of gold to put in our pockets and take with us as we sail across the ocean to trade with other countries.  The US dollar and other currencies are supported by the fact that the people of a given country (call it a community) acknowledge it is an ‘I owe  you’ for goods or services in the future.  That simple.  Not gold..but a promise to take back that piece of paper (US Dollar) and give up a chicken, goat, widget..whatever…at some point in the future.

3.	Where did money come from in the first place?  Who got the first dollar?  Let’s say Bob got the first dollar.  So what did Bob give up for that first dollar..a goat?  Some gold he found.  Great..so Bob walked over to Doug and said, “Hey Doug, I’ll give you this gold for that ‘I owe you’ piece of paper?”.  That doesn’t sound right.  So how did it go down.  Did the government just print a bunch of ‘I owe you’s’ (ie: dollar bills) and distribute them equally amongst the people?  Did the people just accept it as something valuable?  Where was the gold to back up its value?  How did that gold get into the governments hands to support the value of those dollar bills?  What did the government have to give up for the gold…certainly not dollar bills as you can’t put the cart before the horse?  

4.	Who cares about the national debt!  It’s just a giant payable on the ledger of the US government.  Somewhere though another country has a giant receivable (aka China).  Well certainly the US must also have a giant receivable from other countries that once we collect we can pay our debt? At the end of the day..none of it matters!  It’s like a perpetual loan….if you never settle it or it never comes due, then it just keeps growing and growing.  And guess what, when you add up all the payables and receivables of all the people, countries, entities, etc. in the world…they offset eachother.  So unless we default on our debt, it really means nothing.  Even if we did default, then what….well personally, maybe they take a car away, but if you are the US government, then what…they take your country away?  No..you go into a workout group…you pay off what you can and get it forgiven…restructure.

5.	Interest rates have always had me a bit stumped.  I did great in finance and mathematics, however I never quite understood the concept of interest rates.  I get the concept of creating value.   For example, I might only give up one chicken for some milk and another chicken for some powdered chocolate, but I you offered me chocolate milk…I might pay 3 chickens.  So value creation is the increase in value created by combining goods or services to receive more in trade than if the components of the goods or services were traded for on an individual basis prior to being combined.  Sounds great…right?  I’m willing to pay more for a product whose whole is worth than the sum of its parts?  Let me propose this - energy is neither created or lost, only transferred.  It’s a fundamental principal of physics.  So with that in mind, if I can measure the effort that goes into creating that great combined product, shouldn’t I only be willing to pay for the inputs to it?  For example, one chicken for the milk, one chicken for the powdered chocolate and how much for the effort of combining them?  Well if energy is neither lost or created, then the effort is measurable by the food the person put in their mouth that was converted to the energy used to mix the chocolate milk drink.  Let’s say it was the equivalent of an apple.  So if I’m paying three chickens for this combined product, I’m really paying that third chicken in exchange for the energy of an apple.  Seems a little overpriced?  That’s because it is!  I propose that value creation is really the result of unfair trades and the inability to measure everything (for various reasons).  So in theory, if everything was perfectly measured and no unfair trades ever took place, then I ask this…why do we need interest rates?  Some will say that interest rights are the premium for being given something in exchange for having to pay it back in the future, including the risk it might not be repaid.  That sounds pretty good and up to Finance 101 standards.  I can buy that, if someone is willing to pay for it, but I ask, in the grand scheme of things (the answer is 42), did that act of lending that chicken today in exchange for getting a chicken back next week really result in the creation of more chicken?  Should I have to give two chickens a week from now as a penalty for having received the one chicken today on loan?  Some say yes, some say no…my only point is some would say this is an unfair trade and in a world where no energy is created or lost, the only variable here is time….so should the borrower really have to pay for that.  He is giving back the same amount of energy he received (welcome to my brain).

So now that I dragged you through that, this is my answer to “What is Bitcoin?”……

BITCOIN IS A GLOBAL CASH BASED ACCOUNTING LEDGER (aka: A CHECK BOOK) THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE, HOWEVER THE IDENTITIES OF ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE MASKED AS A SET OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS.

It really is that simple.  How it works is a different beast as far as how everyone can see it, but again, that is not what I want to answer here.  So if you accept my definition, then quite simply think about it like going to the bank and looking through all their accounts.  You can see which accounts have how much money, what date they deposited or withdrew money, how much money there is in all the accounts.  The only thing is, at the bank, the accounts have names you recognize.  My prediction is that in order to legitimize Bitcoin, there will need to be trusted banking institutions (with controls and regulations) who associate the masked Bitcoin account number with a name and address (as is happening right now at Coinbase and other formerly popular Bitcoin exchanges).   Coinbase will become the first bank of Bitcoin!  There will however always be those how don’t take their Bitcoin to the bank and effectively keep their Bitcoin “in their mattress”…so no one will ever know their name.   Regardless, the Global Accounting Ledger will always keep track of how much is under their mattress based on their masked account number, instead of their name.  

So to round out my above ramblings

•	Bitcoin really will form the basis for the first potential cash based global accounting system.  Maybe Google can host it.  Maybe none of us will have bank accounts or need to file tax returns….they will all be stored on GoogleBank and be measured in Bitcoin.  We won’t have to file tax returns as the IRS will just access or GoogleBank account.  Gone are the days of Quickbooks and MYOB.  

•	So what about Fort Knox?  Well…the Bitcoin community will be just as strong as the current country based communities that issue fiat currency.  It is all in what you agree on and believe in…..but remember, there is no gold at Fort Knox!

•	Who got all the first Bitcoins then?  Good question!  You need to go read up on bitcoin “mining”.  It is not unlike the first miners that mined for gold.  

•	And settling national debt then?  Well…not sure Bitcoin will solve that, but a Global Accounting Ledger in one Bitcoin currency will sure bring transparency and simplicity to who owes who what?!!

•	Then do away with interest rates and unfair trades?  Not at all!  Unfair trades will always be there as idiots are born every day.  The common currency and global ledger will just allow for things to be priced more efficiently without having to account for exchange rates.  Interest rates I’m sure will always be as they are a just a cost of giving something to somebody for a period of time and expecting it back…..theoretically an unfair trade when talking about thousands of days vs. infinity.



For how Bitcoin actually works, how to get a wallet and how the Global Accounting Ledger is copied and validated by the users on the network (aka – no different than a clearing house….arguably more reliable)……I suggest you don’t wait a year to find out.  Bitcoin is the future…….get your wallet now!",cryptocurrency,1394598078
Bitcoin,Bitcoin Ecosystem is just a 21st century throwback to Wild Cat banking.,"**A common conception of the wildcat bank in Westerns and like stories was of a bank that left its safe somewhat ajar for depositors to see, in which the banker would display a barrel full of nails, grain or flour with a thin sprinkling of cash on top, thus fooling depositors into thinking it was a successful bank.**

This is exactly how Mt. Gox operated.

Bitcoin insurance FDIC style is impossible. No insurance company will ever be able to store/own enough bitcoins for any payouts in the event of a meltdown. Imagine if they had to raise bitcoins via short term loans? The interest rate would need to be through the roof to attract willing lenders. You can only insure bitcoins for FIAT value. The capital cost of raising such a stash would require costly insurance premiums. How many people want to pay 10% commissions per trade? Insuring bitcoins for payment in bitcoins would be impossibly costly. 

Andreas talks about using the blockchain for exchanges. How? The total exchanges per day already exceed the capacity of the blockchain's transaction limit.

The only way to insure bit-coin's is by debasing the existing ones and creating a pooled multi signature adress.

dogecoin,Move Your Business Away from Cryptsy Immediately: They Really Do Seem to be Intentionally Manipulating the Market,"Cryptsy is a disaster. It ruins almost every rally that ever happens with Doge, seemingly entirely on purpose. I also have some very interesting screenshots from their website crashing which reveal numerous unfilled, super-high buy orders of all sizes in their trading engine that are not being filled (as in hundreds of higher orders that probably only appear when they want them to). I can come up with no explanation for those orders but that they are using them to manipulate the market, and they are somehow imbedded in their trading engine by some Kasperov-beating super computer they commissioned.

Besides the market always disappearing during rallys, Cryptsy also stinks because of CONSTANT ""Bad Gateway"" errors and/or involuntary logouts, abysmally slow deposits that happen virtually instantly ANYWHERE else (but take 24-48 hours on Cryptsy), AND an overall customer service non-delivery they should be absolutely embarrassed about. 

Why can't they take some of the MILLIONS of dollars they rake in and make a working website with bandwidth and staff to cover everything needed? Bandwidth costs next to nothing nowadays, and they can certainly afford to be staffed properly, as well as have a functioning, FAIR trading engine. 

Cryptsy is pathetic, and it causes large losses of money to their customers, because ALL ACCESS TO FUNDS is COMPLETELY CUT OFF during their ever-present problems. At times it seems you'd be better served meeting a stranger in a dark alley with cash sticking out of your pocket than doing business with Cryptsy.

Additionally, if anyone can remotely spell or punctuate, take a close look at Cryptsy's support ticket auto response. It's grossly under-punctuated, and they can't even spell ""withdrawal"" correctly. If you haven't used Cryptsy, believe me, you will be opening plenty of unanswered support tickets in your first 24 hours of trying it out. Here's a ""greatest hit"" direct quote from their auto-response to a question properly marked to be about a deposit, not a withdrawal. It almost sounds like Dogespeak:

""Withdrawls User did not confirm the withdrawl email. To resend a confirmation, go to the bottom of your balance page and resend the confirmation email https://www.cryptsy.com/users/balances. If you hit enter, the email will NOT be sent. You must click the link to send Want to cancel an unconfirmed withdrawl? You can do this on the balance page at the bottom with the cancel option https://www.cryptsy.com/users/balances""

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 64 - Bye-Bye MultiPools,"Hey all, GoodShibe here!

Today is a momentous event! 

With the successful release of [QT Wallet version 1.6](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/207hfb/ann_dogecoin16_its_ready_all_you_need_to_know/) we have, for the first time in our history, been able to successfully take back control of our coin from the multi-pools and the strip-miners who have, for so long, used our DOGE as a stepping stool to get more BTC.

Long time readers will remember, but for those who haven't been reading my posts for very long, the *very first* Of Wolves and Weasels was actually titled:

*[Locking out the Wolves and the Weasels: Protecting Doge from opportunists](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1uk84t/locking_out_the_wolves_and_the_weasels_protecting/)*

In that post I specifically spoke about the threat of Multi-pools, how they were dumping DOGE onto the exchange at any price, pulling down the value of our Dogecoins.

Back then, things were so precarious - our DOGE was worth a mere 25 Satoshis, the multi-pools were hitting us hard (well, comparatively) and it really seemed like our little currency could've gone either way.  

My goal at the time was to try and rally all 20,000 Shibes (ha!) to just start mining.  Mine with everything they had, try to push the difficulty up as much as they could to try and keep the multi-poolers at bay.

It didn't really do all that much... but it did inspire my fellow Shibes to get out there, mining while the getting was good.  Trying to get as many DOGEs as they could, no matter how little they might get (heck, we even had people mining with their android tablets and cellphones, breaking out 1-2Khs here and there).

And yet through it all, we persevered.  

Our scrappy, cute little DOGE stood strong despite TENS and HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of DOGE being mined and dumped onto the market, daily.  

We've taken our lumps against the strip-miners, and, if things play out the way they're supposed to with this 1.6 version, we're going to come out of the other side of this with a whole new renewed vigor.

It's definitely something to be excited about!

All that said, having been through this experience, it's one of the reasons I'm not really a supporter of *any* multi-pools.  

I appreciate that there are many Shibes out there who don't think it's a big deal to strip-mine 'lesser' coins for DOGE, but please remember that that's exactly how *WE* were seen.  A 'lesser' coin. 

Those who came and took from us didn't care about us or our community or our coin.  

We were a means to an end and nothing else.

Do you remember what happened to FedoraCoin?  If you don't, you can read [that post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xioxf/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_34_our_cryptofamily/).

But, essentially, the multi-pools swooped in and almost flat-out destroyed their coin.

They came to us for help, asking for the hashpower necessary to overcome the difficulty left in their wake -- which had, essentially, left them unable to find or mine any more blocks.  We helped them get over that hump -- and, to be fair, once the multi-pool heard, they also did try to help and make things right.

But what of those coins who don't know how to ask for help, or know how to fix things?  Do they 'deserve' what happens to them?

We survived because we have a strong, passionate community.  But some coins just aren't there yet, or are just getting started.

If you really want to get DOGE for yourself - and if you can't mine DOGE directly for yourself - please consider taking part in the DOGEconomy.  This is a community full of fun, kind, brilliant Shibes.  You have talents, you have skills.  Check out /r/jobs4dogecoins or /r/dogeservice and put your abilities out there.  If you can make things, consider selling them on /r/Dogemarket or /r/dogebay.

Let's try not to let our DOGEconomy stall around us!  Buy things in DOGE, sell things in DOGE and let's get our DOGEs out there, running free.  Jumping from hand to hand.

If you're not sure what you're good at, or if you have skills worth any DOGE at all then there are lots of other ways to help the DOGEconomy -- help get restaurants to accept DOGE in /r/dogefood or help create the next generation of DOGE software/widget/wallets in /r/dogecoindev.

There's lots to do around here and even more that needs to be done.

This launchpad won't build itself, my friends -- but today, discouraging the multi-pools from trying to strip-mine our DOGE, is a fantastic step forward in preserving that which we've already built, helping to keep it from crumbling around us.

So, let's celebrate!  

Definitely mark this one down on the timeline, add it to the list of our 100 Days of Dogecoin (which, incidentally, **our 100 Days is a mere 6 days away!**)

Because this is a big one, my friends.

Much love to /u/lleti for pushing this forward, to the fantastic /u/digibytedev, creator of the coin '[Digibyte](http://www.digibyte.co/)' (/r/digibyte) for being all-round great folks and helping us to implement their DigiShield difficulty algorithm.  Now our Rockets have a much-needed forcefield technology!  (Okay, maybe not, but still... that'd be pretty cool!)

Thank you to the many Shibes who first noticed the issue at hand and had the courage to bring it forward -- I know there was one Shibe specifically, who had created a thread that, in frustration, even explained, in detail (with code) how to pull off what they were doing.  

That thread has since disappeared into the mists, most likely removed, but I remember you dear Shibe and understand your frustration.

/u/somegeekintn warned us a month ago [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1xg0w7/are_miners_gaming_the_system/).

/u/peoplma warned us about 2 weeks ago [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemining/comments/1yynmz/there_is_a_cycle_of_difficulty_changes_and_net/)

If you also created a thread warning us of this, please let me know in the comments with a link, I want it to be recorded for posterity.  

Thank you, all of you, for your service to our community.

It's 8:40 AM EST and we're at 59.28% of DOGEs found our Global Hashrate is spiking from ~58 to ~84 Gigahashes per second and our Difficulty is holding steady at ~948.

These are the last few days of Multi-pools jumping off and on, taking from for themselves and leaving scraps for us.  Watch that clock tick down, my friends and wave bye-bye when they leave.

As always, I appreciate your support!

GoodShibe

**SYNOPSIS**:  This post talks about the history of multi-pools and Dogecoin and how we are taking back control of our coin.

**SUPPLEMENTAL**

Community Challenge Week is still in full effect!
___

**Community-Wide 'Weekly Challenge'**:

**Beginner**:

* Bring up 'Dogecoin' one time in casual conversation.  If it fizzles, let it.  If not, listen to what they say, their concerns, their misconceptions.

**Intermediate**:

* Tip some Dogecoin to a friend who doesn't yet know about Dogecoin.  Paper Wallet, Mobile Wallet, QT Wallet, Lite Wallet -- whatever you like.

**Advanced**:

* Wear something Dogecoin-related in public all week long.  If anyone asks you about it, stop what you're doing and talk to them about it.  No pressure tactics or anything.  Listen to what they have to say.  Their concerns.  If they're amenable, give them some Dogecoins.

**Epic**:

* Talk to a small business or restaurant about Dogecoin.  Ask them about their concerns - be honest about volatility, risk, etc.  *Don't try to sell them*, ask them what they'd need to have to feel comfortable accepting it.  Maybe the answers will surprise us, maybe they won't.

**Legendary**:

* Talk to your local media about Dogecoin.  Note: You should feel somewhat comfortable speaking about Dogecoin, knowledgeable about what it is, how it works.  If interested in undertaking this, I recommend creating a 'Legendary' Thread in the sub and talking it out with the community ;D)

Bitcoin,Bitcoiners do not understand inflation - focus on politics,"Bitcoin, the protocol, is brilliant. Regardless of whether Bitcoin endures as a currency or not, aspects of the protocol are going to be incorporated in ways that we cannot currently imagine. To have the network validate ""truth"" between 2 parties without an intervening 3rd party is very novel. This fundamental innovation is here to stay.

Bitcoin, the movement, is less brilliant. And sometimes confused. In the Bitcoiner's view, inflation means a currency is being ""debased"" in the most pejorative sense of the word. In this simplistic framework, inflation = bad. For the Bitcoiner, a chart showing how inflation has devalued a nation's currency over time is proof that a nation's central bank has destroyed wealth. This is flawed thinking.

Inflation is but one economic measurement. It is not the only measurement. If you will indulge a sports analogy, it is akin to only focusing on turnovers in a football game. Yes, turnovers are not good, but the sole goal is not to limit turnovers. It is to win the game. And the game, for policy makers, is or should be to increase the standard of living. That's the goal: Increase the standard of living.

When you see a chart showing how the dollar lost value, perhaps even 98% since the Federal Reserve came into existence in 1913, do you honestly believe that we live at 1/50th the standard of living as a person in 1913? We live longer. We have cars with airbags. We have access to the world's library of films in our living rooms. The average person can afford a trip on a jet airplane. We have access to vaccines. We have access to a much wider variety of foods at all times of the year. Our drinking water is safer. There is very little that was better in 1913 compared to today. 

So what does the dollar being worth 98% less than it was in 1913 even mean? There are goods and services that John D. Rockefeller could not have bought with his entire fortune in 1913. Such as a cellphone. Or travel from NYC to London in 7 hours. Or a flu shot. 

Dismissing the role of central banks in a modern economy solely because currencies lose value does not stand up to even the simplest historical examination.

One of history's greatest currency destructions happened in Germany from 1922-1924. Germany had just lost the Great War (later known as World War I.) The mark to dollar exchange rate fell from 190 marks per US dollar in 1922 to 630 billion marks per US dollar by November, 1923.* Needless to say, the currency was destroyed. But German industrial capacity remained. England, in contrast, returned to the gold standard in 1924, which it had suspended during the war. This set in a period of austerity and deflation in England…stable prices and all. Yet, by 1939, Germany was a vastly superior industrial power compared to England. (If it wasn't for America, the English would be speaking German.) 

(*The number was referenced from one of my favorite books on the subject, Lords of Finance by Liaquat Ahamet - A tale of 4 central bankers during the 20s. A must read. I can't do it justice.)

Basically, if you own a tomato farm that can produce 100,000 tomatoes per year, it still retains the capacity to produce 100,000 tomatoes regardless of how much a tomato costs. Like in Germany. Utilizing and expanding economic capacity is what matters. The currency might lose all value, but the land or factory simply doesn't vanish.

If you prefer a more recent example, take the past 25 years. Japan vs. China. In 1989, Japan was forecasted to have become the world's largest economy by today. China was a 3rd world country. Japan had an economy that was several times larger than China's even though it had 1/10th the population. Since then, Japan has had 20+ years of next-to-zero inflation and sometimes deflation; their currency has been among the least ""debased"" in the world. China, with a good dose of annual inflation every year for the past 25 years, is now the world's 2nd largest economy having surpassed Japan.

Do you think any thinking person would suggest that Japan has had a better 25 years of economic performance than China? Yet, if you only measure inflation, Japan is the winner. Inflation is only one metric. China's economy has been the world's great growth story: A billion-plus people being pulled into modernity due to capitalism.

(Japan's new Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, practically ran on a platform of promising to bring back inflation. Interview in Foreign Affairs: http://www.foreignaffairs.com/discussions/interviews/japan-is-back)

Part II.

Another aspect of the Bitcoiner's argument is that a saver would have lost money over time as the currency was ""debased"". If 50 years ago, a person had $10,000 and put it in their mattress, then yes, it would buy less of some goods today than it could buy in 1964.

However, if a person had the inclination to put it in a FDIC-insured bank or US Government bonds, he would have more. For instance, assume the person earned an after-tax yield of 3.5% for the past 50 years. 1.035 x $10,000 = $10,350 is the amount you would have after year 1. To get year 2: You multiply 1.035 x 1.035 x $10,000 to get the compounded amount you would have after 2 years. To get the amount compounded over 50 years, you would take 1.035 to the 50th power. That means 1.035^50 x ($10,000). You get 5.58x or $55,800. If you increase the after-tax yield incrementally to 4% ($71,000) or even 5% ($110,000), you'd have much more.

If you invested 100 years ago in 1913, you would have over $300,000. This is 3.5% compounded on the original $10,000 in US backed government bonds. $10,000(1.035^100).

(Yes, I know you cannot get 3.5% today, so don't get hung up. It is meant to be an uncontroversial average. People were getting 5%+ on CDs in 2007. In 1980, you could get 14% on US Treasuries.)

In a nutshell, you DO NOT get rewarded in an economy that expands its monetary base by keeping your money in a pillow. You DO get penalized for taking the money out of circulation and keeping it idle.

(That's why we have blinds in poker: You can't just sit and wait for pocket aces. Blinds force action as does inflation.)

If you save money in the form of lending it out at interest, in a healthy economy, the interest you earn more than counteracts the loss of purchasing power caused by inflation.

The basic point remains that inflation, by itself, is not any indication of whether an economic system is successful or not.

Bitcoin,A challenge to Bitcoiner's views on inflation and economics,"Bitcoin, the protocol, is brilliant. Regardless of whether Bitcoin endures as a currency or not, aspects of the protocol are going to be incorporated in ways that we cannot currently imagine. To have the network validate ""truth"" between 2 parties without an intervening 3rd party is very novel. This fundamental innovation is here to stay.

Bitcoin, the movement, is less brilliant. And sometimes confused. In the Bitcoiner's view, inflation means a currency is being ""debased"" in the most pejorative sense of the word. In this simplistic framework, inflation = bad. For the Bitcoiner, a chart showing how inflation has devalued a nation's currency over time is proof that a nation's central bank has destroyed wealth. This is flawed thinking.

Inflation is but one economic measurement. It is not the only measurement. If you will indulge a sports analogy, it is akin to only focusing on turnovers in a football game. Yes, turnovers are not good, but the sole goal is not to limit turnovers. It is to win the game. And the game, for policy makers, is or should be to increase the standard of living. That's the goal: Increase the standard of living.

When you see a chart showing how the dollar lost value, perhaps even 98% since the Federal Reserve came into existence in 1913, do you honestly believe that we live at 1/50th the standard of living as a person in 1913? We live longer. We have cars with airbags. We have access to the world's library of films in our living rooms. The average person can afford a trip on a jet airplane. We have access to vaccines. We have access to a much wider variety of foods at all times of the year. Our drinking water is safer. There is very little that was better in 1913 compared to today. 

So what does the dollar being worth 98% less than it was in 1913 even mean? There are goods and services that John D. Rockefeller could not have bought with his entire fortune in 1913. Such as a cellphone. Or travel from NYC to London in 7 hours. Or a flu shot. 

Dismissing the role of central banks in a modern economy solely because currencies lose value does not stand up to even the simplest historical examination.

One of history's greatest currency destructions happened in Germany from 1922-1924. Germany had just lost the Great War (later known as World War I.) The mark to dollar exchange rate fell from 190 marks per US dollar in 1922 to 630 billion marks per US dollar by November, 1923.* Needless to say, the currency was destroyed. But German industrial capacity remained. England, in contrast, returned to the gold standard in 1924, which it had suspended during the war. This set in a period of austerity and deflation in England…stable prices and all. Yet, by 1939, Germany was a vastly superior industrial power compared to England. (If it wasn't for America, the English would be speaking German.) 

(*The number was referenced from one of my favorite books on the subject, Lords of Finance by Liaquat Ahamet - A tale of 4 central bankers during the 20s. A must read. I can't do it justice.)

Basically, if you own a tomato farm that can produce 100,000 tomatoes per year, it still retains the capacity to produce 100,000 tomatoes regardless of how much a tomato costs. Like in Germany. Utilizing and expanding economic capacity is what matters. The currency might lose all value, but the land or factory simply doesn't vanish.

If you prefer a more recent example, take the past 25 years. Japan vs. China. In 1989, Japan was forecasted to have become the world's largest economy by today. China was a 3rd world country. Japan had an economy that was several times larger than China's even though it had 1/10th the population. Since then, Japan has had 20+ years of next-to-zero inflation and sometimes deflation; their currency has been among the least ""debased"" in the world. China, with a good dose of annual inflation every year for the past 25 years, is now the world's 2nd largest economy having surpassed Japan.

Do you think any thinking person would suggest that Japan has had a better 25 years of economic performance than China? Yet, if you only measure inflation, Japan is the winner. Inflation is only one metric. China's economy has been the world's great growth story: A billion-plus people being pulled into modernity due to capitalism.

Another aspect of the Bitcoiner's argument is that a saver would have lost money over time as the currency was ""debased"". If 50 years ago, a person had $10,000 and put it in their mattress, then yes, it would buy less of some goods today than it could buy in 1964.

However, if a person had the inclination to put it in a FDIC-insured bank or US Government bonds, he would have more. For instance, assume the person earned an after-tax yield of 3.5% for the past 50 years. 1.035 x $10,000 = $10,350 is the amount you would have after year 1. To get year 2: You multiply 1.035 x 1.035 x $10,000 to get the compounded amount you would have after 2 years. To get the amount compounded over 50 years, you would take 1.035 to the 50th power.

personalfinance,Assistant in Student Loan Repayment Plan,"Right now I have $40k in federal student loan debt with about a 5.5% interest rate. I've started with $47k and have been paying it for about 2.5 years now, my minimum payment is $560.00 a month (it use to be lower). Anyways, I make about $2.4k a month post-taxes and post-retirement. I live rent free but not with my parents. My savings is currently at $7.5k. 

I was planning to tackle the student loan pretty hard by putting about 1k a month towards the payment and then about $500 towards my savings. This leaves about $900 for other items. I do not have a car payment or any other major debt payment.

After filling in my information (Verifying beforehand that I was on the real Discover website with proper security credentials) it said I was approved and that I would receive my card in the mail in a few days.  It did not have any other information, no APR, limit, card number, place to transfer my balance, nothing, not even in the email they sent to me verifying my approval. Is this normal? I have NoScript on my web browser, and reloaded the page with all script allowed, so it may have blocked some elements and not loaded the rest upon the refresh, but I am not sure if I was really approved or if it was merely submitted and I have to now wait to get a response. Compounding my confusion in this, I received two emails nine minutes apart confirming my submittal for the card. I seem to remember seeing the information about my new card when I was approved for an AmEx card last year, but am not sure what is standard operating procedure.

I have been getting way more money than I should have and haven't been paying enough taxes.

My question is this: I have heard that if you open a traditional IRA (or was it roth?) you can claim a deduction on your current owed taxes. I think the amount was: $2000 towards a traditional IRA then an $600 refund or something of that amount. Is this true?

personalfinance,"Need to pay down debt, but also need to save...I'm in quite a pickle and need advice!","Sorry for the wall of text r/personalfinance, but I'm desperate for advice right now.

Before I go into my debt detail, let me give you a little info about myself. I am currently a senior in college, about to graduate in December. I currently work a job where I make around $700 a month, give or take. I have enough money in my savings account to pay rent until my lease expires, plus $400 in savings. I am currently trying to save for the time that I may be jobless for a while in early 2015, as I will be getting married (no big wedding, just a courthouse ceremony) and moving with my (then husband) to his next duty station, which is outside the United States.

Now, here's where the tricky part comes in. I still have loans that I will be needing to take out for the fall semester, though I am hoping I won't need anymore private loans. My situation is alot worse than I would like to admit I fear, and I want to pay down as much debt as I can before I move so that I don't leave my future husband with my mounds of debt.

Here's the scoop:
My current monthly bills (not including my rent):
phone - $97 (I know this could be lower, and have looked into cheaper options, but I don't want to compromise my service. I have thought about switching to T-mobile from Verizon, since they pay the ETF. Does anyone know how their coverage is? Is it just as good as Verizon? If so, this could help tremendously...because I am paying out the ass.)
Electric - around $50
Private loans - $45 (minimum payments)
Credit Cards - $132 (minimum with both cards)

My outstanding debts are:

$6300 on credit card 1, with an interest rate of 8.25%
$400 on credit card 2, with an interest rate of 18.25%
My private loans are at $39,000, with an interest on all of them of 7%.

To answer any questions that I may get asked about my 1st credit card, I was young, and working a job where I made about $100 paychecks, living much outside of my wealth while I was living at home. Before I knew it, it snowballed into this pile that in about a year, paid down from the $7200 it was. 

So, with all of that information, if any of you can give me good advice on how to get this paid down as much as possible while still saving, I would appreciate it. I am currently searching for a better job, and have a summer job lined up on campus that is easy and will bring in more money, but I know I will need to find a second job, and fast. 

I am just not entirely sure where to begin to pay this mountain down, and want to pay as much as I can before marriage and moving, start a EF, as well as still manage to have money to do some fun things this year while I can. I don't want to have to be a hermit because I'm too broke. :/

In the meantime here is my Pay with Bitcoin button http://www.adrianchilders.com/payments

This is just a personal blog and it's dated, but should anyone decide to send some btc my way I am going to start a non profit to create a platform where people can create their own governments/organizations. We need to move away from overbearing, geographic based governments and create communities online so that people can choose which governments or societies they want to be a part of instead of having to be part of a country just because we were born within a geographic area. 

If companies are not allowed to create monopolies why can governments monopolize their citizens? People should be able to choose the government they want to be a part of and be able to leave if they are no longer happy with the government. People should be able to decide how much they are going to be taxed and how much regulation, protections and benefits they want from their government. Governments should compete for citizens as opposed to citizens being born into a society without being able to opt out. 

I'd love to collaborate with people on this subreddit. I envision a platform similar to reddit or a wiki of some sort where people can draft their own constitutions, bill of rights, vote for their leaders, etc.

You can friend me on facebook or follow on twitter. Make sure to send a message to introduce yourself

I'm sure this will get down voted by ""patriots"" loyal to their federal governments but for those disenchanted with lack of choice and want to create a better system I look forward to working with you. We need to be able to opt out of our federal government and choose the societies we want to be a part of.

personalfinance,Borrowing from TSP,"I saw a couple comments yesterday and meant to reply to them, but forgot. They were discussing borrowing from TSP (the US federal employee's equivalent to a 401k), and a couple wrong things were stated that I wanted to correct, along with providing additional information and links.

First, all of this info comes from the [TSP website](http://www.tsp.gov). Specifically, this [section on loans](https://www.tsp.gov/planparticipation/loans/loanBasics.shtml) and this [much more detailed pdf](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk04.pdf).

The things that people seem to get wrong is where in your TSP account the loan money is pulled from, and how repayment works.

Which funds is the money borrowed against? Proportionally against all of them. If your balance is 100% in one fund, that's where all your money comes from. If it's 50% in two different funds, then half your loan is from one, half from the other. 20/30/50, then, again, that's the percent of your loan that comes from each fund.

How long is the repayment period? Depending on your loan type either 1 to 5 years (you setup the loan, these are the bounds) for general purpose (anything goes) loans or 1 to 15 years for residential (purchase or construction of a *primary* residence). You can repay early without penalty. Remember, this loan is really against your retirement so no bank cares about the loss of earnings for future interest payments. Paying it off early is the best thing for you.

What's the interest rate on the loan? This is where some of the confusion comes in, I think. You pay interest based on the G Fund rate the day you took out the loan. If the rate is 1% on the day you borrow, that's your interest rate. If it's 2%, then that's your interest rate. The interest payments are added into your TSP account, it's not lost to the system. While, in general, TSP loans are probably not a good plan, this is the best aspect of them.

How are repayments allocated? In each pay period your paycheck is deducted by the repayment amount, that money is allocated just like your regular TSP contribution. If your regular contributions are 100% G Fund, your repayment is 100% G Fund. If it's 50% I Fund, 20% S Fund, 30% C Fund, then that's how your repayment amount is allocated.

If you don't work for the federal government, other qualified retirement accounts can also be borrowed against with similar rules. Check out this [IRS Site](http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-regarding-Loans) for information about that. The repayment period and interest rates and a few other loan terms are decided by your retirement account managers, within the constraints set by the IRS.",finance,1394665338

gaming,What are all your thoughts on Titanfall?,"Please don't downvote for my opinion on the game. I'm a bit disappointed but I'm curious to hear other peoples thoughts. I must admit I haven't played very much. I think I just hit level 6, so I am unaware if things get better later on. Here are my complaints so far.

1. The game runs like complete shit on my PC (gtx 580 overclocked, 3.5ghz quad core, 16gb ram). My pc runs BF4 at pretty high settings at 50-60fps and can't even run titanfall smoothly (which basically looks like a 360 game) at 1080p. Yes that's right I can't even run it at 1080p, I have to turn it down to 720p and even then its still not as smooth as BF4. Curious to hear if anyone else has performance issues on decent pcs. 

2. Fuck the bots. They are nothing but a distraction. There's been several times where I see a couple enemies so I shoot at one only to find out I was shooting at a bot while an actual player killed me. Or when I'm in a titan I see a group of enemies and fire all my rockets and guns at them while a real player shots at me from behind with anti titan gun. 

3. I feel the Titans come too easily and too quickly. I find pilot vs pilot gameplay just more enjoyable. It's fast paced, exhilarating, and satisfying. The titans just seem to interrupt that fast paced gameplay with how often they appear. In fact I think I encounter titans more often than I do pilots. Pilot vs titan gameplay is slow paced and boring. Fire a rocket, slow reload, fire another rocket, repeat. I think titans should be buffed up and be much harder to obtain. I don't think every player should be able to get a titan every match. They could have made the titans available when you get certain kill streaks. They could have gotten really creative with how they are delivered and such. For example you could have your killstreaks set to 3, 5, and 15. A 3 killstreak could give you a pretty small fairly easy to kill titan. A 5 would set down several npc mini titans that roamed around and shot rockets, or a mid ranged titan, or 3 weak titans for yourself and 2 other players on your team. And a 15 would deliver a massive titan that you can just wreck shit in, and it would take several pilots to take it down. These are just some quickly thought up ideas, but my main point is titans could have been much more of an impact if they weren't so common. 

Overall I feel its a decent game, but not nearly worth all these 9/10 5/5 reviews.",technology,1394701270

personalfinance,Please convince me that buying a new (used) car is a terrible idea.,"Hi r/personalfinance

I really need your help. Here's my background information:

- Graduated from college in May '13
- $100,000 student loan debt (three different loans with interest rates from 4.5% - 8%)
- Current salary $72,500 (end of year bonuses from 10-15% to put me right around $80,000)
- Monthly net pay $4,607.12
- Monthly fixed expenses $2,012.69
- Monthly Discretionary income $2,594.73
- Current savings of $7,000
- Pre-approved for an auto loan for the value of the car at 1.99% interest
- Checking account returns 2% interest (which makes the interest on the loan completely negligible)

I found a beautiful CPO 2010 Volkswagen CC for $17,000. It's had only one previous owner, only 29,000 miles, and has an impeccable service history. It also comes with a 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  This dealership is supposedly 'no-haggle', but I'm fairly confident I could pull the price down to $16,000.

I currently drive a beat up 2001 Geo Prism with 141,000 miles on it. I hate driving this car around - I really want something that I'm excited about getting into, though I know buying a car with my level of debt is probably irresponsible. I also travel often for work (typically three days a week), and live in a downtown metro area where I'm able to walk most places I need to go - including the office - so I don't drive terribly oten as-is.

personalfinance,"Spoke to Discover rep today, need advice on what he told me","I have a 3315.90 balance on a Discover card at a 25.99% penalty interest rate. Believe me, I know. It sucks. Minimum payment is $91 and I pay $100. $72.xx goes toward interest. I am trying to get aggressive about paying it down. Been budgeting with YNAB since Jan 1 and imagine that, I have extra money now to throw at it.

So I called Discover today to see if there was anything they could do to help me out with this horrifying interest rate so I could get this thing paid off. The guy I spoke said no, it's locked at that rate. Can't go up or down. However he offered me a (sort of) solution. He could reduce my interest rate on new purchases to 17.99% and give me 0%/6 months. He advised me to utilize my $1k available balance to pay my everyday expenses like gas, groceries, restaurants and then whatever I charge to the card, pay at least that amount plus the $100 I'm already paying each month to work down the balance @ 25.99%. He told me any payments I make over the minimum would go toward the 25.99% balance first. Then, pay as much extra per month as I can to pay down the new balance before the 6 months is up and even then, it will revert back to the new interest rate of 17.99% so I would be money ahead even if I didn't pay it off in the 6 months.

If I'm diligent, and don't charge more to the card than I would normally spend within my budget anyway and make the payments like he suggested will this actually save me on some interest? Seems like I would just be trading a balance at 25.99 for a balance at 17.99 which should help me pay it down a little bit faster.

Does this make sense or is this guy just trying to get me to charge more to the card? Should I just disregard this as nonsense and get crazy about paying this balance down as quickly as possible the old fashioned way?",finance,1394750442

energy,Duke Energy Coal Ash Plans,"Duke Energy CEO Email:

Six weeks have passed since a broken stormwater pipe released coal ash from our retired Dan River Steam Station into the Dan River. As part of our immediate response, teammates on site worked tirelessly to install permanent plugs inside both stormwater pipes that run beneath the site’s two ash basins. They also successfully removed coal ash in an area of the riverbed below the broken stormwater pipe’s discharge point. We, along with various agencies, have continually tested the water in the Dan River. The drinking water has remained safe.

We have undertaken a number of additional activities since the initial days following the ash release at Dan River. We initiated a near-term engineering review of all our ash basins to identify and address potential risks. Just as importantly, a team is focusing its expertise and energy on identifying ways to strengthen the comprehensive ash management plan we’ve had in place for years.
I want you to be aware of plans we have shared with North Carolina officials regarding our management of coal ash at Dan River and across our system. We propose to:

    Permanently close the Dan River ash ponds and move ash away from the river for use as lined structural fill or to a lined landfill. This work would start immediately upon confirming the destination for the ash and securing the necessary permits. Once those details are in place, we would expect to complete this work within 24 to 30 months.

    Accelerate planning and closure of the ash ponds at the retired Sutton coal-fired plant in Wilmington, N.C. We will evaluate the possibility of using the ash from this site as lined structural fill, as well as other options. We will submit a conceptual ash basin closure plan to the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) within six months. We will complete the removal of water from the Sutton ash basins in the next 18 to 24 months.

    Move all ash from the retired Riverbend Steam Station near Charlotte away from the Catawba River. Like Dan River, we would seek to find a lined structural fill opportunity or a lined landfill for the ash. Upon confirming the destination for the ash and receiving the proper permits, we would expect to complete this work within 48 to 54 months.

    Continue moving ash from the Asheville, N.C., plant to a lined structural fill. We will look for similar ash reuse opportunities where allowed under upcoming coal ash regulations.

    Convert Unit 5 at Cliffside Steam Station and both Asheville units to dry fly ash. Alternatively, these units could be retired from service. If the conversion to dry fly ash option is selected, this work would be completed within 30 to 36 months of receiving the necessary permits.

    Minimize the potential risk of a discharge similar to the one that occurred at Dan River by accelerating ash pond water removal at all of our retired coal plants. This work would be completed within 24 to 36 months after receiving the required permits.

Of course, implementing these near-term recommendations and longer-term plans depends on state and federal agreement that these are prudent, cost-effective and environmentally sound options.
For more than a century, our company has provided reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. Coal-fired power plants produced a good portion of that electricity. Throughout that time, we have managed our ash basins using industry standard technology and monitoring practices. We continue to place the safe operation of our ash basins as one of our highest priorities.
I am confident we have the right team in place to strengthen our ash basin management strategy. We will continue to work with the appropriate parties outside the company to solicit valuable input, challenge assumptions and build consensus on the right approaches.
This is a journey that will entail a great deal of work and continued scrutiny. Through it all, we will demonstrate leadership and accountability.

Thank you for your dedication and, above all, your focus on safety.",energy,1394756959

personalfinance,Payoff student debt vs retirement savings,"I am looking for some advice. I am 27 and racked up a decent amount of student debt, $80,000. It landed me in a great career, so I am not complaining. I stayed at my parents home a few years after school to pay off the easy target: $13,000 private loan at 9.3% interest. It was gone a year and a half after I started working. I currently have approximately $55,000 left in loans.

But now I don't know where to go. Do I go for the private loans even though they have the lowest interest rate? Do I hit the federal loans? What should the game plan be? I thought I had one but I keep waffling.  

In addition, I am only saving for retirement in a 401k where I max out the employer match (50% up to 6%). Instead of adding additional funds to a Roth or something, I'm putting the extra money I have on these student loans. The current plan has me adding $450 in addition to the minimum monthly payment of $750. I am a little worried though that I should be saving more for retirement, but when I try to figure out what would make the most sense... I just need more opinions.

I work full-time maintenance and make roughly $18,200 yearly after taxes, etc. In my head that seems like it should be plenty to live on, but when it comes right down to it and I put it on paper... it just doesn't cut it. I was hoping I could get some suggestions on how to go about making positive changes or getting some good strategies to better my chances of moving in to a place of my own.

* Dental Bills - $50
* School Debt - $150
* Spending Money - $200
* Gym - $15
* Emergency/Car maint. - $50


This brings me to $900 a month, leaving just $500 for living expenses such as rent, utilities, food, etc. 

I live in NE Ohio, so if I looked really hard I could find a decent (small) space for a little under $500 with rent and utilities. This brings me right up to my $1400, without a single penny for savings and without thinking about roughly $200(?)/month for food. 

How to other people my age do it? I do see that one problem right off that bat would be that I've allotted for so much excess ""spending"" money... that could transition into food money. Even still, that leaves not a single penny for savings, clothing, laundry, toiletries, or any type of unforseen expenses. 

It's extremely disheartening for me to see that I make nearly twice the Federal Minimum Wage... yet it seems impossible for me to even survive on my own. I am very fortunate to have a family who supports me and lets me live in their home, I realize...

I also have an emergency fund with $9,000. I also have $7,000 in my checking, which has been pretty stable, and I'm getting $500 back in taxes. 

Based on my financial situation, especially the student loan debt, should I open a Roth IRA? I havent begun saving for retirement and my employer doesn't offer a 401K. I'm not sure if the money is better spent on tackling my student loans. 

Also, should I change to income based repayment for my federal loans? It would make my payments less burdensome (about 1000K a month right now) and I think I could use that money to pay off the principal on my 8% loan. The only down side I can think of is that I will have the federal loans hanging around for more than 10 years. 

Constructive advice is much appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1394765180
news,Deep Blue Group LLC: U.S. Stocks Retreat with Emerging Equities on China Data,"U.S. stocks declined with emerging-market equities while base metals drove commodities lower as an unexpected drop in Chinese exports fueled concern that growth in the world’s second-largest economy is moderating.

The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) fell less than 0.1 percent from a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 percent. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was down 1.2 percent by 4:52 p.m. in New York, the steepest drop in a week. China’s CSI 300 Index fell to a five-year low. Copper posted its biggest two-day drop in 28 months, while lead and zinc also retreated. Corn prices sank the most in three months while 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose for the first time in five days.

China’s exports dropped the most since 2009 in February, underlining the challenge faced by the government in achieving the 2014 growth target of 7.5 percent with lawmakers meeting in Beijing on [economic policy](http://deepbluegroup.org/). Japan’s economy grew less than estimated in the fourth quarter and the current-account deficit widened to a record in January. In Crimea, Ukraine began army drills as Russia’s Foreign Ministry warned of “lawlessness” in the former Soviet republic’s eastern provinces.

“We’re just waiting to see what goes on overseas with geopolitical situations and developments,” Stephen Carl, principal and head equity trader at New York-based Williams Capital Group LP, said by phone. “We need to keep an eye on overseas because we’re still waiting on a concise agreement in the Ukraine, but markets, as we saw last week, continue to grind higher despite that.”

**Market Anniversary**

The S&amp;P 500 has surged more than 177 percent since falling to a bear-market low, reached five years ago as of yesterday. The measure rose 1 percent last week, buoyed by improving U.S. hiring and manufacturing data. The S&amp;P 500’s valuation rose to almost 16 times member companies’ projected earnings, the most expensive level of the year.

Industrial stocks paced declines today among U.S. equities. Boeing Co. dropped 1.3 percent after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers and crew during a Malaysia Airline System Bhd flight to Beijing March 8. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. slid 3.8 percent and Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. lost 2.5 percent, among the biggest declines in the S&amp;P 500.

Chiquita Brands International Inc. soared 11 percent after the owner of the namesake banana label agreed to buy Dublin-based Fyffes Plc in an all-stock transaction that values Fyffes at [about](http://deepbluegroup.org/about.html) $526 million.

**China Trade**

China’s overseas shipments plunged 18.1 percent in February, customs data showed March 8. [Economists surveyed](http://deepbluegroup.org/) by Bloomberg predicted exports would rise by 7.5 percent. Premier Li Keqiang announced this year’s economic-growth goal at the opening of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress in the capital last week, a target unchanged from last year.

“China is moderating but only very modestly,” Donna Kwok, a Hong Kong-based senior China economist at UBS AG, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “Ultimately you need to wait for March data to really get a true sense of the underlying outlook. The PBOC is very consciously guiding the recent volatility. We see the default as a risk, as a shift in investors’ mindset.”

The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) fell 2.9 percent, the most since June and the lowest close since Jan. 20, to pace losses in emerging-market indexes. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong slid 1.8 percent to a one-month low.

**Commodities Slump**

Malaysian Airline System fell 4 percent in Kuala Lumpur after the disappearance of its jet.

Brazil’s Ibovespa fell 1.5 percent to the lowest level since July as commodity exporters including iron-ore producer Vale SA tumbled. China is Brazil’s largest trading partner.

The S&amp;P GSCI Index of commodities slid 1 percent. Copper futures dropped 1.7 percent in New York after touched the lowest level since June. The metal has fallen 5.8 percent in the past two sessions, the biggest two-day slump since October 2011. Lead retreated 0.6 percent and zinc fell 0.8 percent. China is the world’s largest consumer of industrial metals.

Gold for April delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle at $1,341.50 an ounce in New York, trading near a four-month high. West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 1.4 percent to settle at $101.12 a barrel.

Corn futures for May delivery fell 2.2 percent to close at $4.7825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Nov. 18.

**Soybean Futures**

The U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its outlook for world corn inventories before the 2014 Northern Hemisphere harvests by 0.7 percent to 158.47 million metric tons, topping analyst estimates.

Soybean futures for May delivery fell 2.7 percent to $14.1875 a bushel, the biggest decline since Jan. 21. Futures have climbed 9.8 percent this year.

The MSCI All-Country World Index dropped 0.4 percent today after completing a fifth weekly gain, the longest run of weekly advances since August.

Investors are also watching developments in Ukraine. The country’s armed forces are testing the combat-readiness of troops, the Defense Ministry said today on its website, reiterating the government’s desire for a peaceful end to the standoff in Crimea.

Russia has vowed to defend the ethnic Russians that dominate the Black Sea region. Crimea’s local government may use a March 16 referendum to leave Ukraine and join Russia.

**European Stocks**

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.5 percent after posting its first weekly decline since January. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company, fell 1.9 percent in London and BHP Billiton Plc lost 1.4 percent.

The Australian dollar depreciated 0.5 percent to 90.19 U.S. cents after advancing to 91.33 cents March 7, the strongest level since Dec. 11.

The People’s Bank of China weakened the yuan’s reference rate by 0.18 percent. The currency declined 0.2 percent to 6.1385 per dollar, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices.

Spanish 10-year bonds advanced, pushing the yield six basis points lower to 3.30 percent, the least since January 2006. The yield on similar-maturity Portuguese securities tumbled for a fifth day to 4.45 percent.

**Taper Pace**

Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell one basis point to 2.78 percent, the first decline in five days. Economists projected U.S. payrolls would rise by 149,000 last month, with the bigger-than-expected 175,000-worker increase in data March 7 indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from frigid winter weather.

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser, who votes on policy this year, said recent encouraging economic reports aren’t enough to change the pace of reductions in the central bank’s monthly bond purchases.

“The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction,” Plosser said in a Bloomberg TV interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed’s tapering of its stimulus program.

Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said in a speech today that he expects the U.S. economy to expand at a rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 2014. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month the economy is robust enough to withstand measured cuts to monetary stimulus.",finance,1394769183

One terrible choice after another, but now I am finally starting to get my act together and become a responsible adult to get out of this $48,614 debt. Right now I have two part time jobs and earn roughly $300/week, with $520 in my back account. 


Here's some screenshots I took from the Sallie Mae website that lists all the loans and interest rates: 
http://imgur.com/a/FKLHX


- Student Loan Total: $45,815.87
- Credit Card Debt: $1,796 (10.15% - 24.99% APR based on creditworthiness, which I pay the minimum of $45 a month and then some depending on what I can scrounge up.)
- And $1000 that my cousin lent me with no interest, but I want to pay him back soon.

All of my student loans are currently deferred until July, but interest doesn't accrue only on subsidized federal loans. I live at home so there's no rent to pay. Food is provided by my family and only money I spend is to eat out about once a week and buy beers sparingly. I don't spend much on anything else. I also want to get a cheap (~$2000) car so I can get another job to bring in more income.


Questions of the top of my head:

- Is it a good idea to put off my loan payments so I can save up for the car?
- Should I pay off the credit card or the loans first?
- In which order should I pay my loans?
- Any other advice you can give?

altcoin,"For Fun, I would like to start my own Mining Pool - Have some questions before I do.","***Note, I want to say I will not be posting a link to any pool I start here, as I do not want to break the rules.  If you are interested in trying it out after I get it up, feel free to PM me and I'll send you the information.  I'm not doing this for money, just for fun really.  There will be no required fee, and won't ask for donations, but you can always help pay for servers if those coins are just burning a hole in your e-wallet, haha!*

***Also, sorry if this has been asked already a bunch, I tried to look but din't have the best luck in my first go, so I decided to start a discussion.*

Hello!

I have some spare Rackspace performance servers which I am thinking I'd like to setup an open source mining pool.  It will be stratum, PHP 5.5 w/ ZendOptimizer/Opcache, memcached, separate MySQL DB (Percona Server of course), etc.  I use CentOS 6.5 at work to host our websites, thought not for any particular reason.  I assume it doesn't really matter, but is that fine to use?  Would using an Ubuntu server be better? Another Distro?  My choices are Arch, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD, Gentoo, OpenSUSE, RHEL (costs more, would just do CentOS frankly...), Scientific Linux, and of course Ubuntu.  Again, I just figure I'll ask.  As for resources on the webserver, how powerful might this need to be?   I'm thinking I'll put it on one of my spare 4 or 8 GB Performance 1 Rackspace servers (4 or 8GB RAM option, which have 4 or 8 vCPU's and 800Mbps/1.6Gbps respectively) - whomever has experience with a pool, would either of these be fine for, say, 50 up to 100 or 200 users?  I doubt I'll get more than that, it's not like I am truly going to advertise it, but you never know.  If it gets popular, I'll actually invest in some better hardware, or maybe even put it on my dedicated box.  Is a mining pool something that can be clustered easily enough?  I assume

Another thing I am wondering, has to do with security.  Would I be fine with IPTables and SELinux?  Or should I look into something more legit?  How do you feel about Vyatta Routers or CloudPassage Halo?


Aside from the system itself, what would be a good coin and/or set of coins I should look into having available?  I really have not been keeping up as well as I suld be and used to be w/ the latest altcoins, but the ones I have let my (modest and meager) hardware are Quarkcoin and Maxcoin - frankly, after the launch failure/debacle of Maxcoin, I'v been wondering if that's just dead anyway.  Are either of those two good to include?  If not, what's better?  

Thank you in advance!  It's kind of late here, so I know I am forgetting some questions being all tired - I'll add more on here as I think of them.  That said, if you have any other suggestions that haven't yet been asked or addressed, bring it up!

Hello! I am Dr. Kristin Omberg, Deputy Group Leader at the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/index.php). I am the Deputy Group Leader of the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies Group and the Laboratory's project leader for the Department of Homeland Security's BioWatch Program.

BioWatch is a detection system that monitors for potential airborne bioterror attacks. Our work mainly focuses on the test evaluation, field sampling, event reconstruction, and sample management system software.

I have also been the principal investigator for research tracking biological agents in the environment. In 1998, I was named one of [American Chemical Society's](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en.html) Congressional Fellow. Today, I am currently a member of the ACS Committee on Chemistry and Public Affairs and the ACS Committee on Budget and Finance.

Why are we here today?

The 2001 anthrax letters contained only two sugar cubes' worth of material. It took five lives, months of clean up and a cost of over 1 billion dollars.  The federal government is working to detect and prevent attacks that would contain 200 times that amount and could cover an entire city.

 I have been working on bio-aerosol detection techniques, atmospheric transport, and dispersion modeling as part of the federal government’s early warning programs. One of the challenges in our work is the lack of knowledge on how a biological agent would behave in an urban environment. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts and I’ll try and answer as many questions as I can starting at **12:00pm ET!**


EDIT: Hi folks! Before we get started, I want to issue a correction on a statement I made yesterday. The US has ratified the BWC. We have not signed off on transparency/verification protocols. I always get those two confused, and apologize for any confusion I may have propagated.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin can be fun; help me create a treasure hunt!,"My favorite way to get people into bitcoin is to show them in person. There is a bit of inertia to get individuals to download an app on their phones, but once they do I think bitcoin's transfer speeds and actual ease of use speak for itself at that point. 

**With this in mind I want to create a bitcoin treasure hunt**.

1. Generate and print a handful of paper wallets. Paper wallet would include catchy tagline with a followup link for more info (about bitcoin and paper wallets).
2. Load 1 mBTC on each
3. Slip into [orange card sleeves](http://imgur.com/452dei2)
4. Scatter them all over a college campus; such as in stairwells, trees, buildings, classrooms, etc. The placement should ideally be provocative (I'd write ""take me"" or ""steal me"" on the sleeve).
5. Finders take paper wallets, follow to website which gives them a short brief on bitcoins, other unfound wallets on campus (show off/educate about blockchain), ***and a quick tool to sweep coins into their wallet.*** 

I want this process to be as dumbed down as possible so that anyone can take this and quickly/easily withdraw bitcoin. Bitcoin is relatively easy to use, so putting it within a user friendly framework is ideal.

**My main problem** is that I don't want to simply refer everyone to make a blockchain.info wallet (requiring a relatively lengthy signup process) just to  sweep the coins. I'd much rather use a simple single-service tool that takes the private code and immediately sweeps into a designated address.

Ideally I want to encourage the user to use a wallet best for them. Whether that be a pc, mac, android, iOS, or web; I want the decision to be theres. I want them to feel comfortable picking their own wallet and then being able to easily (without signup or hassle) paste a private key into a tool and have it sweep the funds onto a designated address.

**Am I being too picky?**

I really wish to do this, and the weather warming is making me more excited to start spreading these around. I wish to do this in waves to keep interest, and I want this to be a hidden learning experience. I want individuals to be able to get through the whole process of finding the paper wallet to having a bitcoin wallet of their own with the funds quickly, easily, and with minimal hassle. I'll use blockchain if I have to, but I'd prefer something more simple that I include seamlessly to the hunt.

personalfinance,Making the best use out of my large tax refund,"I've been lurking this sub for a while now, but this is my first post here. Like most Americans, I recently filed my taxes, and today I received my tax refund in my checking account. Interestingly enough, I received a full refund of my federal taxes from last year, $3,600. My main question at this point is whether I should use this money to pay down my student loans (which are substantial), invest it (which I have yet to start doing), or some combination of the two. So here's some info on me and my current financial situation:

I'm 27 years old and make slightly under $3K/month after taxes

I have a few thousand dollars in my checking account (pre-tax refund)

I have about $155,000 in student loan debt, which breaks down as follows:

Stafford Loans (6.8% Interest): $150,000. I'm currently repaying via IBR at about $300/month

Perkins Loan (5% Interest): $4,500. I'm coming out of grace period, and my first payment is not due until 5/26.

My emergency fund has $19K in it.

I have a trust fund with ~$15K in it. I don't touch this money. It's basically there for when I eventually want to buy a house and need a down payment.

And that's pretty much it. I haven't started investing any money for retirement yet because a) I only started working this past July after graduating from med school, and b) I'm only a few months into repaying my student loans and wasn't sure how much I'd have left over at the end of each month to invest. I recently started monitoring my budget, so after a few months I plan on seeing how much I can afford to put into a retirement account (I'm hoping for around 5-10%).

Anyways, this brings me to the question of what to do with this tax refund. If you made it this far and forgot, it's $3,600. It's a substantial amount of money and I don't want it just sitting in my checking account. Given everything I've laid out so far, do you think it makes more sense to just throw it at my loans, invest it (maybe open up an IRA?), or do a combination of the two.

dogecoin,"To clarify the ""We need to grow up"" post: serious where needs be.","[My latest post was absolute disaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/20cuxt/we_need_to_grow_up/). I admit that explaining my mind is not my best skill, [but when even GoodShibe makes a dedicated daily post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/20eayu/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_66_only_as_serious_as/) that is aimed at dismantling it while mostly misunderstanding your point, you know that you've done goofed. That's why I felt the need to make this clarification post, and that's why in the future I'll refrain from writing dramas after a 14 hours work shift. (application releases suck, especially if you forgot to test your application during the last month or so)

So, here's a new post, hoping for it not to be yet another ""moar serious plz"" post and hopefully speaking the mind of a group of shibes whose voices get silenced too often.

The first thing to say is that I have to backpedal on the dogespeak argument. That is something that is personal and up to one own's personal to use it or not in whichever situation they want as it doesn't affect other shibes, even though I still wanted to remember that our strength is our community's friendliness and not the doge meme itself. 

But whatever, let's jump to the main point of the post. **You can start reading from here**

In this community the majority of shibes seem to be phobic of two things: seriousness and talk of value. 

Of course, there's absolutely no denying that it would be a problem if this community became serious: we'd lose everything that makes us unique. Might as well call ourselves Bitecoin and settle it at that. (geddit? Because dogs bite, and and a byte a computer thing. Gehehehe). 

But on the other side of the spectrum resides the problem of this community taking everything **too lightly**.

During the last recession it was made painfully obvious the fact that we absolutely REFUSED in the most categorical way to give importance to anything. The price tanked and we *STILL* refused to stop bashing and laughing at people who were concerned about the value. I understand the mentality behind not caring about how much our coin is worth *at all times*, every morning waking up being worried whether our coin gained or lost X percent of yesterday's value. But when the coin's been on a constant downward line for the latest two weeks, with a loss of over half its value and no sign of stopping, maybe it's ok to be concerned. Just *maybe*.

It doesn't mean we're becoming Bitcoin, we're only acting out of necessity. GoodShibe's post is titled "" Only As Serious As We Need To Be"". And that is exactly right.

Because, as I already said, our community's priorities are others, true, but we must also keep in mind that our coin's value is an aspect to which we are indissolubly tied to, even if only for our charity drives. 

You are not concerned about it? You don't care about it? That's completely *fine*. All of this doesn't mean that *you* have to be concerned. Hell no. You are free to do whatever you like and act as carefree as possible, even if the sky is falling. But I want to ask you to respect the shibes that want to act seriously, the same way they respect the shibes acting silly. Please, **do not ostracize other shibes that want to be serious**, especially in times of crisis. That's it. Nothing else. I repeat for emphasis: I'm not asking you to be more serious, but only to respect other shibes' decisions. It's their own decision to take all of this seriously, it doesn't affect you and it's a necessary service for our coin to stay alive.

I mean, we regard ourselves as a friendly community and the only people that we are not friendly to are the ones that are concerned about this coin's health? What the hell? Trolls are literally more welcomed than serious shibes: I saw people tipping huge amounts to users that said the nastiest things about our coin and our community, while ""serious"" shibes usually get downvoted to oblivion.

dogecoin,Only serious where needs be.,"[My latest post was absolute disaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/20cuxt/we_need_to_grow_up/). I admit that explaining my mind is not my best skill, [but when even GoodShibe makes a dedicated daily post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/20eayu/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_66_only_as_serious_as/) that is aimed at dismantling it while mostly misunderstanding your point, you know that you've done goofed. That's why I felt the need to make this clarification post, and that's why in the future I'll refrain from writing dramas after a 14 hours work shift. (application releases suck, especially if you forgot to test your application during the last month or so)

So, here's a new post, hoping for it not to be yet another ""moar serious plz"" post and hopefully speaking the mind of a group of shibes whose voices get silenced too often.

The first thing to say is that I have to backpedal on the dogespeak argument. That is something that is personal and up to one own's personal to use it or not in whichever situation they want as it doesn't affect other shibes, even though I still wanted to remember that our strength is our community's friendliness and not the doge meme itself. 

But whatever, let's jump to the main point of the post. **You can start reading from here**

In this community the majority of shibes seem to be phobic of two things: seriousness and talk of value. 

Of course, there's absolutely no denying that it would be a problem if this community became serious: we'd lose everything that makes us unique. Might as well call ourselves Bitecoin and settle it at that. (geddit? Because dogs bite, and and a byte a computer thing. Gehehehe). 

But on the other side of the spectrum resides the problem of this community taking everything **too lightly**.

During the last recession it was made painfully obvious the fact that we absolutely REFUSED in the most categorical way to give importance to anything. The price tanked and we *STILL* refused to stop bashing and laughing at people who were concerned about the value. I understand the mentality behind not caring about how much our coin is worth *at all times*, every morning waking up being worried whether our coin gained or lost X percent of yesterday's value. But when the coin's been on a constant downward line for the latest two weeks, with a loss of over half its value and no sign of stopping, maybe it's ok to be concerned. Just *maybe*.

Am I saying that we have to be more serious, overall? No. 

Am I saying that we should let go of being silly? Of our friendliness? Of our jokes? Of our spirit? No.

What I'm saying is that **we have to understand the fact that THERE ARE TIMES where it is COMPLETELY OK for us to be more serious**.

Bitcoin,The CFTC regulating bitcoin will be a huge blessing,"The CFTC stands for the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission. They ""regulate"" currency trading, forex, and futures contracts, as well as some other tiny niches.

1) First of all, the current chairman of the CFTC loves bitcoin.

2) The CFTC is a federally chartered gambling institution. They do not even pretend to draw a line between ""investing"" and ""gambling"" because there is no need for an ambiguous moral distinction where there is none. CONGRESS through legislation has stopped the CFTC on multiple occasions where the CFTC was ready to reshape american capital markets towards economic freedom.
case in point:
- futures were once banned in the united states (citation needed)
- Onion futures are banned in the united states by an act of congress
- Box office futures are banned in the united states by an act of congress, immediately after the CFTC approved their existence and policies to make them work

3) Tax treatment of CFTC regulated products is VERY FAVORABLE. It would benefit all cryptocurrency holders. The public does not understand anything except ""income tax"" and that is just during election years, but the real party is AND ALWAYS IS in futures and currencies. Look up the 60/40 rule.

4) Every institution the CFTC regulates is a gambling institution. These guys just don't care, if you want massive MASSIVE leverage, you want CFTC regulation.

AMBIGUOUS ASSETS thrive under CFTC regulation, where a different agency such as the SEC will certainly be akin to a fascist dictator via comparison. ex. Single-stock futures, Stock index futures, etc. These are futures contracts for securities that affect the securities market, yet enjoy 60/40 tax treatment, MASSIVE MAAASSSSIVE leverage, no pattern day trader rule, etc.

personalfinance,Check my logic on an auto loan.,"I just got approved for a $10k auto loan at 1.65% APR. The rate is good for a loan up to 60 months. I plan on paying off whatever I end up buying within two to three years, but I'm not finding any reason why I should take a shorter loan term if it doesn't affect the interest rate.

My thought is that I should just take the longest term possible and pay as much as I can every month toward the principle. That way I have a low ""minimum payment"" in case anything happens. If, for example, the car needs work done, I can use some of the money I'd normally put toward the payment, rather than using a higher interest credit card (obviously would come out of my emergency fund before either).

Does that make sense? If so, should I take that a step further and not even bother paying more of the principle? At a rate that low, wouldn't it make more sense to just put that money into a higher interest account instead?",finance,1394849226

Bitcoin,"YSK: Bitcoin can be debased, and this is how we prevent it.","In many of today's economies more than 70% of the money in circulation does not exist in form of coins or bills. It has not been printed by the central banks or the federal reserve. Relevant [image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/MB%2C_M1_and_M2_aggregates_from_1981_to_2012.png) and [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply).

Instead, most of today's money has been created digitally in form of bank credit. This is the money we use daily when we make use of debit and credit cards, bank transfers or checks. It is the money in our bank accounts and here's how this form of debasement works.

----------
**How Fractional Reserve Banking can debase a currency**  
*And how Bitcoin is not immune to it*

Most of you in this subreddit already know that today's bank don't keep 100% percent of the customer's deposits in their vaults. Instead, they're only required to keep up to 10% in the US, 1% in the EU and there is no reserve limit in Great Britain.

This means that a Bank can take Bob's $100 deposit, credit it to his account and offer $90 to Alice* in form of a bank credit. 

Of course, Bob is still able to use that money: watch what happens when the next day both Bob and Alice go to the local pizzeria: Alice pays $90 an Bob pays $100 dollars with his debit card. 

How much money does the owner of the pizzeria now have? $190 even though no such amount of hard money exists in the system. But indeed, there's now $190 worth of currency in the economy and consequently the effect of monetary inflation.

Of course this only works if the pizzeria has their bank account at the same bank as Bob, but since most people use the same limited amount of big banks, in the end it ends up working similar to a closed loop and banks can estimate what percentage of their ""non-hard"" currency can be sent / lent without having trouble. 

In the ends, what's important to notice is that under a fractional reserve system even hard currency such as gold or physical coins can be multiplied if people accept a digital non-hard counterpart. 

**Bitcoin is hard currency**

Bitcoin can't be multiplied or created arbitrarily, but an alternative unit of account acting as de-facto Bitcoin and perceived by society as such can be. And this is, unfortunately, quite easy to achieve. 

First of all we need a Bitcoin Wallet Provider, let's call it ""CoinPay"", for example. Either without user's knowledge or because they are powerful enough to lobby their way into legislation, they operate under a Fractional Reserve Banking system. 

Of course this service is very convenient and very safe for people such as grandma and grandpa. Most ""average"" citizens use bitcoins through their CoinPay accounts and most business have a CoinPay account as well. 

Now, when I log in into my CoinPay account it tells me I own 10 BTC. But of course, we can also deduce that since it's a Fractional Reserve System, the real BTC are actually somewhere else and not necessarily in cold storage. 

Fortunately for me I'm able to pay with my ""Account BTC"" as if they were really there. For CoinPay it's really convenient as well. Since most companies and businesses also own an account with them the only thing they have to do is transfer a number on their private ledger without even moving any real BTC, or better yet, without even needing to have any real BTC. 

They can also calculate the percentage of real reserves they need based on the amount of external wallets and wallet provider competitors. But in any case they if they're competent enough they can keep the system up and running without problems just like modern commercial banks do. 

**In the end, the perceived effect to the Bitcoin economy is of monetary inflation, even though the amount of hard bitcoins hasn't changed.** Alternatively you can think of it as if people had stopped using bitcoin and had started using an alternative currency (the account BTC) and the effect this would have on bitcoin's value. 

**How can we prevent such a situation?**

I might be wrong and this is only my personal opinion, but I would like to predict the following things: 

- Fractional Reserve Banking of Bitcoin will be very lucrative for some companies and a good amount of people will end up interested in this possibility. 

- If commercial banks ever accept Bitcoin deposits they are sure to make use of FRB just like they do with fiat currency. If it's not legal yet, they will lobby in order to regulate FRB of cryptocurrencies. And they sure seem to have the money and power to do such a thing. 

- Most people won't care. They will go for the most convenient option to store their bitcoins, not caring if they have access to the private keys, their coins are stored under FRB or if their wallet provider launders money for drug dealers. Oh wait... that is already happening.

- Once Bitcoin is popular enough, Wallet Providers won't care about the minority of people threatening to withdraw their bitcoins, doing blockchain detective work or whatever. After all, grandma, grandpa and most of the population are perfectly happy with their wallet account. 

- It is likely that most people use only a handful of wallet providers, just like most people use Gmail, Live, Hotmail and GMX webmail despite there being almost endless alternatives.

Maybe, to an extent, bitcoin will be more resistant to the effects of Fractional Reserve Banking than fiat currency. But that does not mean it will not exist or have a noticeable effect on the Bitcoin economy and value. 

**The easiest way to prevent the above mentioned scenario is to make decentralized wallets (AKA Bitcoin clients) easier and, more secure and more convenient to use.**

Of course I do realize that this is already in the works, yet I also notice an increase in centralized wallets and their convenience and advantages cannot be ignored. Neither can a FRB scenario be ignored, especially because given the possibility it will be a very enticing option for the parties involved. 

These are my two bitcents. What do you think?

I've been paying the $1500 loan off for the past year or so and I'm going to have around $1700 left over from my pell grant at the end of the semester. So, I think that one's getting paid off in full within the next 2 or 3 months. My concern is the interest rate on the $5000 private loan. Would it be a wise decision to take out the $5500 federal loan that I'm eligible for next year as a junior and use that to pay off the private loan? 

I'm pretty sure the interest rate will be smaller and it will be subsidized. I'm planning on living at home for the next two years and commuting. I'm sure I'll receive a pell grant for around the same amount as last year, which I'll use to cover the price of gas, etc. I currently have a part time job, and since living at home will cut my expenses (No rent, food, utility expenses, etc), I plan on putting around 50 to 75% of my monthly income towards my federal loans.

Dear Robert,

Thank you for contacting me about Bitcoin. I appreciate hearing from you.

As you may know, Bitcoin was first introduced as a digital payment system in 2009, and has been described as either a digital currency or a digital commodity. It allows for pseudo-anonymous transactions without third-party involvement.

Since its introduction, Bitcoin's value and popularity have increased dramatically. Users may appreciate its low transaction costs and increased privacy. Because Bitcoin does not require a third-party intermediary, transactions may be less expensive than traditional online payment systems.

Use of Bitcoin, however, is not without risk. For instance, Bitcoin has experienced tremendous price volatility. In addition, Bitcoin networks have struggled with security. One of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, was recently forced into bankruptcy following a security breach that led to a loss of more than 800,000 Bitcoins.

I look forward to learning more about Bitcoin and other digitial currencies. In the meantime, please be assured that I understand your views on Bitcoin and value your input. I will keep your thoughts in mind as work continues on this important issue.

Thank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.

Time is of the essence for me, and I'm starting to panic as my world is going to collapse if I don't get a loan soon. 

I'm a student receiving no help from his parents studying computer science at a university.

I've asked multiple times on reddit for help to no avail, but I figured I'd give it one last shot before I give up.

ANY advice is appreciated.",finance,1394918978

CryptoCurrency,What about exponential POW?,"With the goal in mind that the hashingpower for a cryptocurrency should be as distributed as possible; imagine a POW function where when you double your hardware, you only increase your hashingpower by e.g. 10%.

As you know for the hashing, all the transactions and the nonce are hashed together. And (in bitcoin and most altcoins) the nonce can be any number. In the first step we add a task that gets more complicated the bigger the number is, for example factorization, and require the output to be part of the block. If the nonce is 30, then the factorization is 2,3,5 - this way the work of factorization is proofed.

This increases the amount of work that has to be done for bigger numbers. For miners this means that even with small equipment you have some chance of winning the hash, with more equipment you have a bigger chance, but it no more increases 100% proportional with the additional equipment.

But this system is easy to attack, you could just take some primenumbers as the output and then calculate the nonce based on them. This means we need a random number that the miner can not influence. So the second addition consists of two parts. First we require every transaction to have a random whole number, that could simply be the output in satoshis (0.00253 coins = 253000 as number). We add these together and get an unique random number for every block. Second we combine the random number and the nonce the following way:

new number = ( ( random + nonce ) * 2^nonce ) + 1

When you add 1 to any given number, its factors are different from the first number. So 30+1 = 31, when factorizing 31 you can not encounter the numbers 2,3,5 because these are the factors of 30. And in fact 31 is a prime. So our new number can be factorized by any prime but 2 (and the random number + nonce). The 2^nonce part also adds an exponential growth to the new number. So the effect of more calculation power for additional hashes grows exponential too. Miners therefor would focus more on smaller numbers, and when they want to have an advantage against the others, they have to invest much more for smaller outcome.

To sum it up, an additional work is added that exponentially increases with the size of the nonce. It encurrages the use of small numbers and makes more hashes per second much more expensive. This benefits small miners and reduces the interest to participate in pools. Therefor this system is good for altcoins that try to be CPU-only and aim at ""one CPU, one vote"".",cryptocurrency,1394928292
personalfinance,So we got credit cards and kind of freaked out...,"So a little over a year ago, we went to the credit union, just to see what kind of credit cards we would qualify for.... low and behold we each had amazing credit and somehow got signed up for them.  We proceeded to max them out before moving in together.  When it was revealed to each other how much we were in the hole, we became committed to being more responsible with our money.  Combining our resources and moving in together helped tremendously, but we are still in the hole! 

Well we got engaged a couple of months ago, and really want to start our life together off on the right foot.  So that is where this beautiful community comes in! I need your brains. 
We have a number of debts between us, some is to family, and some is not.  Also, we are  aiming to move in May sometime but more on that below.
I don't know if this is relevant, but he is 32, I am 29.
Debt in general makes me super nervous, and the long term goal is to pay the debts off and build a healthy savings account/emergency account/long term savings accounts. 
The short term goal is to get through the next 6 months using our money safely and efficiently.  Any and all advice is much appreciated!!!  

I am sure the following description of our financial situation could be more organized, but this looks as confusing as my brain feels! 


Both of our credit cards are in the freezer. 

My father has given us $5,000 for the wedding, and we are going to come in under that budget (super small ceremony in August).

My fiance is a student and will be for the next 3 years, at which time he will be employed as a nurse. 

He currently has enough in the bank for spring tuition and living expenses through the end of April. 

Grandmother is also going to be paying his tuition starting in the fall (we are going to take care of her so she doesn't have to leave her home at age 93). During this time, I will be covering both of our regular monthly expenses.

We are fairly frugal, we always eat at home/bring lunches (with the occasional dinner out).

We are expecting a deposit back from our current rental situation of about $1,275 when we move out.

I am currently selling some assets and should net around $5,000 for them by mid April.

Moving expenses expected to be ~$800.

My current take home is ~$1,275/mo.

When we move my income may decrease for 3 months to ~$600/mo. before resuming to normal.


Our debts:

His Student Loans (previous degree, current degree): ~$16,000 (interest rate?) deferred until graduation.

His Family Debt: ~$3,000 (0% APR) to be paid back once employed.

His CC BAL ~$4,000 (8.9%? APR): ~$115/mo. min.

My CC1 BAL $820 (15.24% APR): ~$50/mo. min.
 
My CC2 BAL $3,150 (8.9% APR): ~$80/mo. min.
 
My Family Debt BAL $4,080 (0%APR): ~$40/mo. min.
 

Our regular monthly expenses:

His Phone bill:  $35/mo.

My Phone bill: $50/mo.

My Car Expenses (gas/ins): $125/mo.

My Roth IRA (BAL ~$5,000) contributions: $150/mo.

*Joint Expenses Currently through April (current balance $500): $1400/mo. (we each contribute $700)
includes: rent, utilities, internet, groceries, cat supplies, household stuff etc...

**Joint Expenses after we move in May estimated: $500/mo. 
includes only: groceries, cat supplies, household stuff


We have separate bank accounts/expenses, and a joint bank account which we put all of our combined living expenses into - this system has worked out fairly well, but if one has other suggestions, I am open to them.

Lastly, I have a conversation scheduled soon with the person who is holds my Roth IRA.  I don't really know what to ask her, or what I should be looking out for about that...so if anyone has any suggestions, that is also much appreciated.  It feels like I am doing what I should be doing by having one of these, but I feel like I am so removed! I don't know if that makes any sense to anyone...

Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this, I have been lurking on here and it has really inspired me to get my shit together!",finance,1394930195

personalfinance,"211k federal student loans, IBR for 10 years vs private consolidation","I just started my medical residency, graduating with 211k in student loans, all federal.  My initial thought for repayment was to go the IBR route and shoot for loan forgiveness after 10 years in service positions.  However, the more I think about it the more I hate the idea of living under this debt for 10 years.

My new thought is to try to pay it off as soon as possible.  I'm making ~$50k/year and my wife should be making ~$80k/year (pre-tax) once she finds a job.  In 3 years I should be around $150-200k annual income.  Once I'm done with residency I could feasibly pay ~$7-9k toward loans/month if devoted a big chunk of income to them (rough estimate as I don't know about future expenses).  At this point in our life we do not have any other debt, though we will likely be buying a house in the next 5 years.  

Right now my loans are federally consolidated with a 6.8% interest rate.  

I guess my questions are:

1.  Is this a good idea and does my plan make sense?

2.  Am I able to and should I try to transfer my federally consolidated loans to a private company to get a lower interest rate (i.e. Wells Fargo, etc)?  Anything better than Wells Fargo?",finance,1394935896
personalfinance,"Figuring out inheritance, advice on where to place the money welcomed","So, my mother died back in December, and she left me most of the liquid assets. At this point this is the breakdown of what I am working with

* MMA with PNC bank (not ideal)
* Scottrade brokerage account
* 401k from Mother's employer
* Ally Checking and Savings Account (my personal savings)

Ok, so with all of the above in mind, this is what I'm thinking of doing, and would just like to make sure I am on the right track here with this, and any advice on which companies to use and why would be appreciated.

$5.5k Roth IRA for last year's income (not sure who to put it with, I keep hearing Vanguard, any other recommendations? I'm planning to put $459 a month for the first few months of this year in as well, and $459 each month for the rest of my life as well, basically just maxing out at the $5500 a year contribution as my employer has no 401k or other benefits at all.

Inherited 401k, I've heard of issues with inherited IRA's, not sure how this works with a 401k. I was honestly planning to just roll this account into an IRA, probably with the same company as the Roth IRA I plan to open, does this make sense as the best option? I looked at administrative fees and other things for the 401k I have and compared to the .05%-%.19% rates I hear for a lot of good funds, it seems the 401k doesn't have the best options.

As for the rest of the money, I'd like to put it into a brokerage account and set it up into low cost ETF's and/or mutual funds, though probably put it into a diversified portfolio with some bonds and other things as well. Since I'm only 23, I figure a healthy amount of risk should be fine.

I only have one qualm over the management of these assets. Currently I'm driving a car which is not my own, and I have wanted my own car again for a while, paying $200 a month in gas and $170 a month for overpriced insurance in my Dad's name is no fun. However since I only have 11k saved, need $6500 or so for my Roth IRA plan, and an emergency fund, and to buy a car (I'm aiming for a 2008 Prius), I need to tap into at least a bit of this money I received. However it doesn't feel like my money, or like something I have the right to really use. Can anyone relate? I just feel like I don't have the income to really support my own freedom in getting a car of my choosing, plus the interest rates would likely be horrendous. Does anyone have any thoughts or recommendations regarding this? I'm probably just being crazy.",finance,1394944058
personalfinance,Criticisms/thoughts on using high dividend stocks to replace liquid savings.,"About 9 months ago I was fed up with the .1% returns on my credit union checking/money market savings.   I invested about 10k in one of the stocks (PSEC) that pays a monthly dividend of ~1%.  So 12% yearly yield is awesome and I take into account that about 20% of that yield will go to federal taxes.

So I am considering expanding to a majority of savings as it has worked out so far as the stock prices of many of these BDCs stay in a narrow range so I'm not as concerned about selling at a low point if I need to make a semi-large purchase such as car replacement or such.  Meanwhile, I can utilize the dividends as pure liquid with no trading fees and such.

Curious if others do the same or have alternatives that are best for the chunk you want to consider liquid/semi liquid savings.   I know it is much higher risk, but just hate the idea of not even keeping up with inflation.   Background - mortgage paid off - 401k maxed - emergency fund in I-bonds.",finance,1394947759

personalfinance,Advice Request: Tax-Advantaged or Not for Our Personal Scenario,"I am looking for tax-advantage vs non-tax-advantaged advice, plus whatever else you think we might have overlooked according to our specific scenario. We have already read tax-advantage articles and understand the difference, as I believe you will find evidenced below.  

I think the big questions, assuming that we have not overlooked anything are:
  
* Do we stay the course with our $28-35k annual Roth 401(k) contribution (see details below).  
* Or do we switch to non-Roth 401(k) and minimize our taxable income and maximize our tax deductions with expected sizable mortgage interest, real-estate tax and child tax deductions (more on that below).   
* Where do we put our next savings dollars after maxing out Roth or Non-Roth 401(k)s, after we build our rainy-day cash fund back up? 

**Income:**
  
* Gross annual income: $203,000  
* Me:     $97,000  
* Wife: $106,000  
* Other details: We started out making about $120,000 (50-50 split) in 2007, and our salaries have grown substantially since then. We expect income growth to continue to trend upwards over time. We have been handily beating the assumed 1.5% income growth that a lot of projections make. I don’t think it’s realistic that our income will grow at the 7-8% annual rate that it has over the past 7 years, but I *assume* we’ll do better than 1.5%  

**Current savings plan for 2014:**
  
* Roth 401(k)s:   
 * My wife and I both contribute 14% to our separate Roth 401(k)s.
 * We receive a $1:$1 match on the first 8% of our contribution from our employer.   
  * Wife and my contribution: $28,420  
  * Company match: $16,240  
  * Total: $44,660
  
* HSA:  
 * 2014 contribution: $4,000  
 * Joint healthcare plan is through me. We are putting $3,000 into the HSA this year and will receive $1,000 from my employer.  
General savings account: We’re putting away about $3,000 cash per month into a general savings account. Normally, this would go into an investment account, but we’re on an aggressive plan to save for a mortgage downpayment.
   
**Balances of all savings/investment accounts to date:**
  
* Me Roth 401(k):   $103,500  
* Wife Roth 401(k):   $70,769  
* Me Roth IRA:         $46,291  
* Wife Roth IRA:       Nothing as she was aggressively paying down student loans.  
* Me taxable investments: $63,308  
* Me lending club: $450 &lt;— really just cashing this out ASAP as I don’t have time to manage this money  
* HSA: $5,000  
* Cash: $120,000 &lt;— this is because we’re looking to buy a home within the next 3 months, ideally. We’ll probably spend the entirety of this amount on down payment, closing, moving and immediate fixes. We have an extremely inexpensive Roth 401(k) loan option should we run into hard times. We’ll also be saving cash aggressively to build back up our rainy-day cash account. 
 
**More financial/life details to potentially factor in:**  

* TAXES: 
 * Federal income tax bracket: 28%  
 * State income tax: 5%  
* CHILDREN: Plan on delivering our first of two or three children in 2015. We plan on maintaining two incomes. 
* HOME: Plan on buying a home in the next 3 months, ideally. It will be in the $500K - $600K with 
 * $17K-$22K mortgage interest (deduction) in first 10 years and 
 * $7K-$8K real-estate tax (deduction) annually.
* IRAs:
 * Our MAGI is $193,000   
 * we cannot contribute to Roth IRAs any longer unless MAGI falls in future years. 
 * we do not qualify for IRA contribution deduction since we are covered by a retirement plan at work.
* SOCIAL SECURITY: This projects out to about $36,000 annually between the two of us. 
* RETIREMENT GOALS: 
 *   I think the *best-case* scenario is that we could retire by age 50-55 with $200-$300k dependable annual income. We would like to retire early, but we realize there are so many variables that cannot be accounted for, and we don't have our hearts set on this.
* Do we expect to see higher taxes in our elder years? No one knows with certainty. Ideally, we’ll move to a local with lower or no state-income tax. I think the analysis is moreso on what do we gain by reducing taxable income and maximizing tax deductions.

Calls for Brennan’s Ouster Emerge Along With Details of CIA Search of Senate Computers http://interc.pt/1cz6O0W

But none of the reports in the media get to the heart of the matter, nor do they ask any searching questions.

John Brennan works for Obama and Obama is supposed to be able to fire him at the drop of a hat, just like anybody else who works for Obama.

Did the CIA Chief Just Dare Obama to Fire Him? http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/did-the-cia-chief-just-dare-obama-to-fire-him.html

So why hasn't Obama fired Brennan and instead stayed silent on the matter? The dispute is not going away anytime soon.

N.B. Brennan gave a speech to the CFR on March 11th. Presumably Brennan used this opportunity to get backup and support from the CFR, in his dispute with the Senate.

Why didn't Obama fire James Clapper and Keith Alexander for their blatant lies to Congress - a Federal crime?

Why would Obama want to approve someone who has proved to be incompetent and is a known supporter of torture from the Bush regime, for CIA Director in John Brennan?

Brennan was canned for nomination in 2009 because of these reasons. Nothing has changed between 2009 and 2013, in regards to John Brennan.

The questions that should of been asked of John Brennan at his confirmation hearings - but weren't http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/02/tis-comment-censored-by-huffington-post.html

What has John Brennan got on Obama?

How did a one term, supposedly very left wing, Senator ever get to be President?

Why didn't the CIA stop him by using their assets in the media to spread some stories to discredit him and prevent him from getting the Democrat nomination?

After all, Obama's only credible rival was the strongly establishment and pro CIA, Hillary Clinton.

http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/01/what-has-john-brennan-got-on-obama.html

Why has Obama refused to prosecute senior bankers for their massive frauds before, during and after the house price crash and instead bailed the big banks out with trillions of dollars?

Why is Obama pushing through blatantly Corporatist ""trade"" deals in TPP and Tafta, which have very little to do with free trade and everything to do with boosting the profits of large Corporations at the expense of National Sovereignty?

Obama has been on the side of the CIA, the NSA and the bankers; and against the Constitution, the Rule of Law and the American people from the get go. There is a very good reason for that.

personalfinance,Transferring rental properties to an LLC or Corporation (US),"Lots of questions, but I've done some research and haven't found a ton on these specific subjects. 


1) I understand there are liability concerns with keeping rented property in your name. What's the consensus opinion here? Are they overstated?

2) Are there any obvious tax benefits to transferring ownership to an LLC or corporation I own?

3) I have very favorable interest rates on each of the properties; are there ways to retain the current loans, or would it involve applying for new loans in the company name? If so, any recommendations for corporate lenders and what interest rates should I expect compared to non-investment property rates?

4) What corporate structure do you recommend and why?

5) Would I have to file taxes in each state that the properties are located in?

6) Is there any way to transfer ownership without it being a taxable event to me personally? Stated another way, would the IRS always consider this type of event a sale from me to the corporation?

Specific to me: 32 years old in the US (Florida), current full-time income is around $90k. No debts with the exception of mortgages. $50k in Roth IRA, $30k liquid (CDs and accounts). 

I currently own four properties, including the one I am currently living in. The other three (one single-family, one duplex, and one condo) are located in different states than the state I currently reside in. The properties are in college towns or near military bases, so rental history has been very solid and vacancies are very low over the past 2-6 years I have rented them. All properties have remaining mortgages of anywhere from $50k to $220k, and between the three properties that are rented I am cash flow positive by around $100 per month before any taxes/depreciation.  The prinicipal is currently decreasing each month by $900 over all properties combined. I currently depreciate all properties and itemize deductions. There is a combined $70-90k of equity in the 3 properties.

If any more information about my situation would help, I can expound, but I'm not sure what else is relevant. Thanks in advance!",finance,1395001553

Here's what i'm confused about - I always thought that with retirement accounts you threw money in there and didn't touch it until you're 60 and magically it turned into $1mil through compound interest. I guess I just thought it was a savings acct with a really high interest rate? Now I see that you're actually ""investing"" in something? Can someone explain this to me? 


If i'm investing in something it seems like things are going to fluctuate, how do I know my money is going to grow? There's no chance of me actually losing money, right?

personalfinance,Pros/Cons of financing MBA with a home equity loan vs. a student loan,"I've recently been accepted to business school and will need to take about 100k in loans to cover the costs beyond what I have currently available in my 529 and from my employer. It is a Saturday only program, so I will continue to work while enrolled, and while I could take out basically all of the money in my brokerage account to pay for it, I'm not comfortable with that idea. So, I'm trying to decide whether or not I should take out a home equity loan for the 100k, or stick with student loans. 

The interest rate on my mortgage is 4.125%, and I have about 200k in equity currently. Lowest I'm able to find for private student loans is around 6.5%. My wife and I are above the income level where we can deduct student loan interest (At least, that's based on my understanding of that deduction, which may be flawed). 

So it seems to me that the home equity is the better move as the rate is lower and I would be to deduct that interest. Are there any downsides to this approach? Does anyone have any experience doing this themselves? Does anyone have alternate suggestions for covering this 100k?

personalfinance,"I have $30K, and 38K in student loans what should I do?","So, through pure fortune, stocks that my parents had invested in when I was born, and that I invested in as a teenager have grown exponentially from a few thousand to over $100K.  One of the stocks hit a stop that we had put on it and sold for about 30K.

My plan was to pay off the majority of my student loans (about 26K with the rest saved for taxes).  Being that I still have quite a bit left in savings, and am making enough to pay for my month-to-month costs, is this an intelligent decision?

To give a bit more background, I am 25M, just finished with a masters degree.  I am working to start my own business, but my field is mainly focused on nonprofit and government work, so I will likely never be making a huge amount of money.  I am more interested in doing work with and for people.  It would be fair to say I will probably make between 40-60K a year. The loan is at 38K (paid off 3K this year so far) and is at an interest rate of 6.8%. I am on the 10-year plan so it is currently set for me to pay about $495/mo not including interest.

Given that information, what would you recommend I do?",finance,1395006665
personalfinance,"Paying off loans, dropped credit score?","Hi, first post here, and I have a few questions, but first a little bit of background info.

I am 23, recently graduated college (December) with a student loan debt of ~$7100 ($5500 principal + interest), and was able to immediately pay it off using money from a college fund my parents started years ago. Just a few days ago I received an email from MyFedLoan verifying that my loan had been paid in full.

I use CreditKarma to keep tabs on my credit score. I guess I was hoping that paying off my student loan would increase my FICO score, but as of today CreditKarma reports a 12pt drop, moving from 727 to 715. My student loan account was the oldest open credit account to my name (open for more than 4 years). I have an open auto loan account (1.5 years) and two Citi credit cards (1 year) that I recently closed and paid off the remaining balances (never missed or made late payments).  I have not yet looked at my credit reports from annualcreditreport.com because I wanted to give a bit of time for Citi to report my credit cards as paid off/closed, and I also don't want to use up the ""1 report per bureau per year"" limit, but if you all recommend I do that then I will definitely take a look at the reports.

I understand that by paying the student loan debt in full (the oldest open account), my average age of open credit lines dropped, and this is why CreditKarma reported a 12pt drop.

My questions to you all:

1. Why did my FICO score not gain any points from paying off my student loan debt?

2. I recently paid off and closed two Citi credit card accounts (both around 1 year old). I did not want to pay the $85 annual fee on the cards, so I closed them and opened a Chase Freedom card, which I'm using and paying off in full each month. Will having paid off the two Citi cards increase my credit score? Or will closing the accounts actually drop my credit score again (because of the avg age of open credit line will drop again)?

I have never been great with money or saving, but last year I told myself I would become financially independent and that is what I'm trying to do. I've been working hard to pay off my debts, and want to do everything I can to increase my credit score.  I plan to get a home mortgage a couple of years from now and want the best interest rate possible.

I just started a new salaried full time position in December, and I am finally bringing in a decent amount of money per month, so I will continue to read /r/personalfinance in hopes of making myself financially stable using your help and advice :)

FOMC Statement on Wednesday - Analysts Expect More Qualitative Forward Guidance

MIDNIGHT TRADER 8:08 AM ET 3/17/2014 

09:08 AM EDT, 03/17/2014 (MT Newswires) --

Monday, March 17 

09:15AM Industrial production, February (consensus +0.2%, last -0.3%)

Manufacturing industrial production, February (consensus +0.3%, last -0.8%)

Capacity utilization, February (consensus 78.6%, last 78.5%)

Industrial production is expected to be up, driven by higher electric and natural gas utilities output in February due to unseasonably cold weather.

Economists forecast a modest reversal of last month's substantial drop in manufacturing IP, due to scheduled gains in auto production.

Manufacturers' schedules suggest auto assemblies of 11.0 million units at an annual rate.

Aggregate weekly hours of manufacturing production workers, a key piece of source data for the industrial production report, continued to show weakness in February (-0.2%), but declined at a slower rate than in January.

Mining output was likely little changed on the month.

10:00AM NAHB housing market index, March (consensus 50, last 46)

The NAHB housing market index dropped 10 points in February, the largest decline in almost 30 years.

The composition of the decline was consistent with a negative weather impact, as current sales conditions and traffic of prospective buyers fell more than future expectations.

However, the under-performance in the West was somewhat perplexing to analysts, given more seasonally normal weather in the western part of the country.

Tuesday, March 18 

08:30AM CPI, February (consensus +0.1%, last +0.1%)

Core CPI, February (consensus +0.1%, last +0.13%)

CPI NSA index, February (consensus 234.699, last 233.92)

Higher natural gas prices likely offset lower seasonally-adjusted gasoline prices, resulting in an approximately neutral contribution from non-core components to the February CPI.

Although ""financial market"" natural gas prices have increased sharply, expect only a modest part of this increase to pass through directly to higher retail prices.

Also worth noting, the three cent increase in postage stamp rates taking effect at the end of January should increase the core by no more than one basis point.

08:30AM Housing starts, February (consensus +3.4%, last -16.0%)

Building permits, February (consensus +1.6%, last -4.6%)

Housing starts posted a huge 16% decline in January, probably due in large part to adverse weather.

Economists forecast starts to remain close to their depressed January level, ticking up modestly.

Building permits have declined for the past three months, and weather remained a negative headwind in February.

Once the weather distortions clear, analysts are more optimistic on a housing recovery going forward.

Wednesday, March 19 

08:30AM Current account balance, Q4 (consensus -$88 billion, last -$94 billion)

Consensus expects a narrowing in the current account balance in Q4, following the $11 billion (quarterly rate) decline in the trade deficit already reported.

The current account is comprised of the trade balance, the balance on income from foreign assets, and unilateral transfers.

02:00PM FOMC statement and Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)

Economists are looking for more qualitative forward guidance on Wednesday.

Possibilities include:

1) Retaining the 6.5% unemployment threshold for now and adding a qualitative description of the Committee's intentions after the threshold is reached.

(2) Switching entirely to qualitative guidance and dropping the 6.5% reference.

(3) Some reduction in the 2014-2016 funds rate projections is likely.

Lastly, it appears likely that the Committee's longer-run projections for the unemployment rate and the appropriate funds rate may decline a bit.

Yellen will likely maintain her stance (side bar: take no risks) in her first post-FOMC press conference, beginning at 2:30PM.

Thursday, March 20 

08:30AM Philadelphia Fed index, March (consensus +4.0, last -6.3)

The Philly Fed index should improve only a bit in March, remaining at a weak level.

Continued very cold weather in Pennsylvania, higher natural gas prices, and weakness in last month's new orders suggest another lackluster print.

08:30AM Initial jobless claims, week ended March 15 (consensus 320,000, last 315,000)

Continuing jobless claims, week ended March 7 (consensus 2,880,000 last 2,855,000)

Jobless claims unexpectedly declined last week, moving further below the four-week moving average of 331,000. The Labor Department did not attribute the drop to any special factors.

Continuing claims declined substantially over the past two weeks, returning to a level close to that seen at year-end 2013.

Continuing claims jumped sharply in the first week of the New Year, but this was due to claims from the expired Emergency Unemployment Compensation program.

10:00AM Existing home sales, February (consensus -0.1%, last -5.1%)

The stabilization in pending home sales in January suggested that the slide in existing home sales over the past six months may be coming to a close. Pending home sales tend to show up as existing home sales within two months.

Friday, March 21 

11:45AM St. Louis Fed President Bullard (FOMC non-voter) speaks

Bullard recently revealed himself as having favored rate hikes starting in 2014. While concerned about inflation that is currently too low, he expects inflation to exceed the Fed's 2% target next year.

01:45PM Dallas Fed President Fisher (FOMC voter) speaks

Fisher is typically known for more hawkish monetary policy views. He recently dissented against the agreed-upon terms of continued testing for the Fed's fixed-rate reverse repurchase facility, with decision-making power on increasing the maximum allotment size delegated to Chair Yellen.

In line with other recent Fed speakers, including Presidents Dudley and Evans, Fisher recently stated that he expects future forward guidance to be more qualitative in nature.

04:30PM Minneapolis Fed President Kocherlakota (FOMC voter) speaks

Kocherlakota has advocated a 5.5% unemployment rate threshold in the past (vs. the current 6.5%), and recently stated that monetary policy could be doing more to push employment and inflation to levels more consistent with its dual mandate.

However, he did not dissent at the January meeting.

07:20PM Fed Governor Stein speaks

Stein is known for his academic expertise in financial economics.

In the past, he argued that tightening monetary policy to address financial imbalances might ""get in all the cracks"" in a way that regulatory or supervisory policy could not.

1. Guaranteed rate: 4.4%. Policy has never paid less than 6%.
2. Can withdraw or ""borrow"" money from the account (always at an interest rate lower than what I'm receiving on the money) completely tax-free.
3. ""Basically, it's like a roth with no restrictions"" - You can put a ton of money into it (until it falls under a certain ""trust"" tax laws) and you can withdraw money for any reason whenever you want.

I did a search and the best I could tell about why r/pf hated them so much were:

1. They have lots of FEES FEES FEES
2. They might be reasonable for high wealth individuals (millionaires+) because they offer a tax shelter

I was wondering if there was a good way I could put a spreadsheet together to compare the fees in WLI to taxes on an index fund investment to see if there was a substantial difference. While that's definitely a factor, I see a lot of practicality in the flexibility of being able to withdraw/borrow money from a WLI investment as needed - i.e. let me pay for a car cash with money from my WLI investment, then just pay it back into my WLI policy on my own - could save 2+% interest on a car loan that way. I know that many people in r/pf are very hardcore money stackers and live in 1 bedroom apartments with 3 roommates and eat ramen all day so they can become millionaires at 35, but the rest of us spend a little bit of money from time to time.

personalfinance,I recently remembered that I hate Wachovia or Wells Fargo or whatever it's called now. Advice on choosing a new bank (and organizing emergency funds/general savings/etc. accounts) would be much appreciated.,"We have a steady income (as of the last few weeks) that we can comfortably put over half of into savings each month because we don't have any credit cards or debts. I've been looking into internet banks (Ally, BoI, etc) recently because I noticed even their lowest interest rate checking accounts have rates an order of magnitude better than Wells Fargo's highest rate savings account. I am a member of NFCU, but I haven't looked into it much because my mom currently uses my account there (it's joint with hers, but she could give it back to me) and there are no NFCU branches anywhere near here.

We are doing everything with debit/checks currently because we're both extremely risk-averse when it comes to money and spending. So we're looking for a checking account for all our spending, along with a savings account, and it would be preferable to have them at the same bank unless there's some reason that's not a good idea (I have no clue). I'd like recommendations about banks we should go to. Ally had the most information on their website, compared with some others I looked at, but I don't know anyone who doesn't use WF or BoA or SECU, so it's hard to get recommendations from people I know.

I understand that an emergency fund should be a normal savings account that you can easily take money out of at any time, but I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile to split our savings and also have a longer-term savings account with higher interest (like a CD or maybe an IRA or something?). Oh, additionally, we're planning to move for me to go to grad school in the winter and have no idea where to yet, not even whether we'll be in-country, so I have no idea how to save for it. We have half a paycheck of savings right now because we've been living for the last three months on what was left of my teaching assistant income last semester and help from friends. So all of our savings is going to be built over the coming year, if that makes a difference.

Again, any advice would be appreciated. This is the first time it's been worthwhile to think about where to keep savings since they finally exist.",finance,1395075869
personalfinance,Can't contribute to an IRA or 401(k),"Hi /r/PF,

I am a grad student who is in a very strange tax situation. I am not employed, nor self-employed, I don't pay payroll taxes, only income taxes, and I have to pay them myself quarterly (estimated taxes). I get paid twice a year through a federal agency in the form of a fellowship and they pay my tuition, as well as other ""related educational expenses"".

I contributed to an IRA in 2013, which the IRS and the Tax Institute (my mom works for H&amp;R Block) said was fine but now they think it is not fine because I don't have earned income...I don't really know all the terminology. But basically: I have to remove my contributions and can't contribute for 2014, either.

Sooooo now what? I moved the money I would normally put in my IRA into my Vanguard brokerage account and put it in Target funds there. Is there something else I can do?",finance,1395084911

personalfinance,How much to have left after buying first house?,"Hey all,

I'm in need of a bit of guidance.  I'm a mid-20's tech worker in Seattle, been here ~3 years, saving for a first-house with my girlfriend/future-wife. We've been extremely fortunate, and I've been extremely lucky in the job market.  Thanks to that I've been able to save a lot in the last few years, primarily stock with some cash, but with no clear goal yet other than ""I'll find a use for it"".  We'd like to seriously start looking at buying a nice-ish starter condo/home in a good location, either later this year or this time next year.  **Edit:** We plan to be married before we go through with buying, so consider us ""newlyweds"" for the sake of argument. :) Question is:

When have we saved enough to do it well, and still be adequately prepared for life after buying? I'd imagine there's lots of things that crop up, so having more padding would be smart.  But how much padding?

If we've saved enough for a 15% down payment + fees/taxes and leave a 6 month cash/stock buffer, do we go for it?  Or do we wait until a 20% down payment is doable with a super large buffer (maybe closer to a 12+ month buffer because termites)? Somewhere in between?

We've been living a medium lifestyle (still go out to dinner once a week or so, might grab happy hour dinner every now and then, but don't splurge nearly as much as some in our position) and got lucky with our current rent situation, so we have a pretty skewed view of the desired housing/income percentage.  Is it actually a not-bad idea to pay ~30% of pre-tax income to housing/mortgage, or is that more the absolute max and should probably be aiming more towards 20-25%, or lower?

A bit about us:

**Income**

* Me: ~$115k
* Her: ~$55k, starting soon

**Savings**

* $30k cash in traditional savings account
* $100k in Fidelity investment account ($15k cash earning 0 interest, $85k investments, mostly company stock, with some riskier stocks and index ETF).  My plan is to slowly move towards a more hands-off portfolio as my riskier investments hit long-term holding in the next 6 months or so, will probably liquidate most of them for a down payment.
* $21k in Fidelity 401k (maxed out matching amount, 6% contribution with matching 3%) and $2k in HSA.  Won't touch these.

I'm averaging up to $2k/month in saved cash and discounted stock.  This will likely pick up a bit once she starts her job, assuming spending stays about the same.

**Debts**

* She will have $20k in student loans, not sure about interest rate.
* No other debts.

**Market**

* In Seattle, avg small home or condo with enough space for 2 is &gt; $400k, and up to $600k depending on the neighborhood and number of windows.",finance,1395090444
personalfinance,More loans or PT Job during college?,"Hi Reddit! I'm currently a full-time college student studying business (second year, will be a 3rd-year in the Fall), and am essentially contemplating between keeping my PT job during the year or quitting it after the summer ends and to just take on more loans. Here's a bit of background:


**Expenses:**

I go to school in Austin and pay about $500/month for rent/utilities for a shared bedroom in a 2bed/2bath apartment near my university. I make enough at my PT job to pay for this. For groceries/food, my boyfriend (who lives in the same complex as me, but different apartment) lets me mooch off of him. Tuition is completely taken care of by university/federal grants and some federal loans. I don't have a car, but I have a bike that I ride to classes and take the bus to commute to work (free bus pass with the college ID)

**Financial Background:**

Last year (my first year of college), my tuition and off-campus housing was paid for by my dad. Half of tuition was paid for by federal loans, and the other half of tuition and my housing was paid by my dad. 

This past summer my dad dropped a bomb on me and told me that he wouldn't be able to contribute *anything* to my housing or tuition because he has too many other things to pay for (my mom and dad have been going through a shitty divorce that hasn't been settled yet and has been going on for at least the past year), like alimony for my mom and lawyer bills. Because of this, I started a part-time job last semester working as an assistant at a small family law firm (get paid $10/hour at about 12hrs/week). 

My mom doesn't know about my job, because she already works a lot. She has two jobs with crazy hours that don't pay very much (She is the 'head of household' now on taxes, which is why I now have grants for this year for school), and pretty much flat out said that she would rather take on a third job than have me work during school (she really wants me to focus on studies, and I'm supposed to be the ""smart one"" in my family). I don't want her to get burned out any more than she already is, so she doesn't know that I'm working, and believes that my dad is still paying for everything. Because of this, I don't think I can ask for her help either, because she doesn't have much extra to give, and I don't want her to find out that I'm kind of struggling.


**My concerns:**

I feel that my job is taking a hit on my grades. Last year it was above a 3.0, and as of now, my GPA is at a 2.61, and doesn't seem to be improving. I took a part-time job because I thought I could balance my college experience with it, but that seems to not be the case. **Should I just suck it up and try to deal with the workload for the rest of my time as a student, or should I free up my time to dedicate to my studies by just taking on more loans and quitting my job?**

**Options that I've considered:**

* Stay in Austin and keep my job until school starts again, and maybe switch from part-time to full-time, or at least getting more hours than my current schedule (or if I can't change my hours, get a second part-time job). I calculated that I can save up to pay for my expenses for at least a full-semester next year. I think I can use loans to pay for the rest of my expenses
* Stay in Austin and take summer school to raise my GPA, but I would still need to have a PT-job to pay for expenses, so I'm kind of concerned that my time-management will still suck like how it is now
* Go back home and for the summer and have take on a job. I don't have a car though, and share with my mom and she has a very irregular work schedule, so I think my work options/work hours will be limited, but I won't have to pay for any expenses
* Ask a family friend for loans? I also think this is helllaaa awkward and a huge thing to ask for, and I don't entirely feel comfortable doing this just because it is a huge favor. Secondly, I'm afraid my mom might find out from whoever I borrow from if I go about doing this

**NOTE: I'm originally from a suburb, so there is really no other way of getting around unless you have a car, since things are so spread out. Austin, or at least the area I live in (close to campus and downtown), everything is easily accessible through the bus system since routes are pretty expansive and stops are frequent. With that in mind, I think it would be a lot easier and more feasible to find a job in Austin. 

Thanks in advance for your feedback and advice!! I really appreciate it. And sorry for the wall of text!",finance,1395091812

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Methods,"Hey, PF, yet another student loan repayment questions. I've done several searches, but haven't come across a question similar to this yet. 

I have approximately $43,000 in student loans from graduate school, at a fixed rate of 7.125%. I am going to set up auto-payments for my minimum payment of $320/month and take advantage of the 0.25% interest rate reduction.

My question is, would it be beneficial to additionally pay whatever interest has accrued on the account on a weekly basis? This way, if my assumptions are correct, by the time my monthly payment is processed the whole thing would go towards principal. Right? And I would be paying less in interest in the long run, I'd be paying more towards the principal every month.

In theory, the weekly interest payments would be decreasing every month after the autopayment, even in it's only a few cents a month. Right?

Thanks, PF.",finance,1395094887
investing,I need help allocating assets between TSP and Roth IRAs,"25 year old federal employee, 2 kids, and wife. We make about 71k combined and will make an additional 29k (tax free military benefits) on the side throughout the year. Because I am having to invest in my TSP and 2 Roth IRAs, I want to make sure that I am correctly allocating my funds. I have decided to max out the 17.5k contributions to my TSP and the remainder invest into Roth IRAs. Target dates were not an option because I have not heard great things about the TSP target date fund. 

The 29k are divided as follows:

60% stock (ROTH TSP -- c fund)

30% International Fund (Roth IRAs (VGTSX)) (Ideas about anything better?)

10% Bonds: 5% ROTH TSP G fund and 5% Traditional TSP G fund

Since employer matching contributions (5% max) are only distributed to the Traditional TSP, I have decided to keep 5% of the G fund in traditional and everything else in Roth accounts. Is this the correct thing to do? 

Also, are my index fund choices the best way to allocate my assets between the TSP and Roth IRA (i.e. C fund, VGTSX, and G fund)?
Your help is greatly appreciated.",finance,1395102312
Bitcoin,Almost 9 months ago I launched a bitcoin only store. Here is an update and some interesting info regarding the journey so far.,"CoinsForTech is fast approaching our 1st birthday and I wanted to give an update of what our first 9 months as a bitcoin-only merchant has been like. I really think we provide a great service and have grown incredibly well since our launch. This is with no mentions from blogs and very little expenditure on advertising. 

There are some figures and statistics below which are incredibly positive. I am most proud of our widespread customer base as accepting bitcoin has really been a game changer here. We do good volume in areas flagged incredibly high risk and have not been scammed once. Not to mention the instant irreversible payments and almost non-existent fees. **IF YOU ARE AN INTERNATIONAL MERCHANT YOU SHOULD BE ACCEPTING BITCOIN.** I cannot stress this enough. Incredibly low start-up and ongoing costs, clear market from bitcoiners wanting to spend, irreversible and instant payments worldwide – what have you got to lose? 

* Since our launch we have sold over $300,000USD of electronics to customers across nearly 40 different countries. All of these sales were in bitcoin. You can see our order map [here](http://coinsfortech.com/about). If our current growth continues we will break $500K revenue for our first 12 months which is awesome, especially given lack of marketing.
* Of these sales we have been scammed a total of zero times. This is an incredible testament to bitcoin as we are in an incredibly high-risk market. I have been in electronics reselling for several years and never have achieved remotely close to a 0% fraud rate.  Quite ironically we have had three attempted scams – each of which tried to pay using credit card.
* **Every day we are transferring HUGE amounts of money between countries with very little reliance upon current banking infrastructure**. We are doing this incredibly cheap and quickly compared to fiat business as well. In March alone we have processed over $50K of orders across 15 separate countries at a fraction of the cost of non-bitcoin businesses.
* We are active in several high-risk markets. In fact, customers in areas such as India, Israel and Pakistan are some of our best. We could never ship to these countries using a system other than bitcoin. We are honestly comfortable delivering to some of the most high-risk countries due to the nature of bitcoin. These markets are now ripe for the picking as our products are significantly cheaper than they can find locally and there is no currency conversion barrier stopping them purchasing from us.
* We have many customers that replace the bitcoins as they spend them. They are using them as a method of payment rather than for speculation. Depending on the market, it is cheaper for many to use bitcoins and purchase internationally than it is for them to use fiat and source locally.
* We just recently broke 1,000 products listed. It’s worth mentioning this is just a fraction of what will be available. Think software, much more camera equipment, video games, fragrances, make-up and a HUGE amount of computer components. I seriously mean huge – it’s going to take forever to get them sorted.

If I move, there is a very good chance that company would just choose to let me go.  If I do this, it would be right around Summer.


I'm supposed to make $800K before taxes this year, but taxes take up almost half my income.  No joke, I live in CA and my effective tax rate is well over 40%.  I feel like I'm working hard mostly for the government at this point.  I just finished my income taxes and I owe $45K between state + federal.  And I claim 0 on my W-4 but I owe like crazy every year (I think because the AMT fucks me).  

Stats:

* I turn 34 this Summer (no kids, no wife).
* I have $425K in my 401k + Roth IRA
* I have $100K in cash that I use as an emergency fund
* I have $50K in I &amp; EE bonds I use as a backup
* I have $80K in 529 plans (not my kids though;  nieces) 
* I have $650K in taxable mutual funds (munis + stocks)
* I own a house that's worth $540K (but I still owe $380K on the mortgage)
* I have $10K in an HSA

So all together I might have $1.8M in assets but with $380K in liabilities.  So ..... questions:


I don't have enough to retire this early, but I feel like I shouldn't have to work full-time at some high paying job either.  I want to just work part-time (20-30 hours a week) at most and focus more on my hobbies (doing music).  How would you guys do this?


My annual expenses I estimate to be about $30K per year without the mortgage and $65K with the mortgage.  


* I could pay off the mortgage by selling off a bunch of stocks, but then I'd have to pay capital gains taxes on most of the stocks I sit on.  This would more than half my taxable investments ($650K to $270K) but at the same time my yearly expenses also get halved.
* I normally don't mind holding the mortgage because I think of fixed rate debt as an effective hedge against inflation, but that argument really only works when you wages that also rise with inflation.  If I quit my job, that's no longer the case. 
* It's not obvious that I would be able to find part time work that provides health care.  Do you guys trust Obamacare enough to cover health expenses in case shit happens?  I would hate to see the assets I built up melt away if I got hit by a car or something and had expensive medical bills.
* There's a very good chance that if I leave my industry, I might not ever get hired into this high of a salaried position again.  I feel like I'd be burning a bridge behind me.  How'd you guys get over this?",finance,1395105530

What they are doing is on a scale thousands of times larger than what that idiot naif Charlie Shrem did. If the Feds took him down, it is only prudent to assume that they are investigating BTC-E as well.

The operators are completely anonymous and eventually when the risks of running the exchange are too high, they will be incentivized to run with the coins.

Citing ""senior American officials,"" [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-flight.html?hp) claims that the divergent turn on MH 370 was preprogrammed into the aircraft's computer. _Their sources are unnamed. They do not provide an explanation as to how they know that the route was programmed rather than flown manually. Thus, we advice you to take this report with a pinch of salt until we receive official confirmation._

dogecoin,Let's talk about a fundraiser. (open discussion),"So, this is a bit self-centric, but I was thinking of running a fundraiser in Doge. I know there are a bunch of Charities we are already donating to such as the water one currently that is raising a lot of attention, but every avenue needs to be explored or at least sniffed, and that's where I was thinking I could come in. 

This summer, I am running a LARP in the state of MN. We are using a rule system from Croatia that is based in The Elder Scrolls' universe. We are keeping the events free to play with the exception of the end year event which will be (hopefully) held in a castle built by a non profit organisation and private donors. 

The LARP scene in Minnesota and the USA is not a pretty one. LARPs where legacy players have complete rule over what's happening due to their levels or earned skills run rampant, and this is a negative thing. It's one thing to have a bit of control over a sector of a game, but a complete different story to dominate the game even if you don't have the real world skill to due so, just because the rules say you can. 

The LARP I am running aims to change that, we have omitted a leveling system completely and have made the main focus of the game Role playing via the players interacting with each other to create their own stories. 

This is not to say that there won't be combat or fighting, there will surely be many, but we wanted to make sure the game is immersive and players become emotionally invested in order to create a great atmosphere. 

This is the part where you could become involved. I want to make these series of events, some of the best LARP events people can try in MN or the upper midwest, but in order to do so, funding is a necessary evil (or blessing). I have a list of a few things that could really help set up a small world for the players to play with; Tents, costumes, the ability to compensate an NPC or two, and a few misc. Props that we could order. 

How can Doge benefit from this? While it is not a huge audience, this LARP has the ability to grow just as anything else does, and with that, we can always let people know it was funded by our fine friends of the /r/dogecoin community. Also, it's nerd culture, there are plenty of ezines or reporting sites that would maybe eat this sort of story up, ""Online community helps raise funds for a man's LARP in order to keep it free for the public to play.""

The more visibility doge get's the better. 

But anyways this turned into a pitch more than i wanted, I just figured I would ask what your opinions on doing such a fund raiser would be. Do you think it could help the Dogecoin community, or do you have an idea on what I should do? Let's have an open discussion.",cryptocurrency,1395115703

I have a few questions regarding my credit score and financing. I am currently an authorized user on one of my mother's credit cards, which helped me build credit initially, but I am wondering when I should have myself removed from her card? I have a credit card of my own that I've had for a year with no missed payments or anything; I am just worried because without my mother's credit card on my credit report, the average age on my credit lines drops to ~six months or so. However, the card of my mother's that I am an authorized user on has a high utilization so I'm not sure if those would in a way negate each other? 

Secondly, I am also paying payments for a car that I purchased last year. My interest rate is 4.9%, and in a year I haven't missed any payments and have since graduated college and taken on a fulltime job. Am I able to renegotiate my APR? My mother cosigned for me when I bought it but would refinancing on my own be of any benefit? 

Lastly, I used to live in Ohio for school. I have since moved out of state but I was unable to cancel the gym membership I opened while there before I left (personal reasons caused me to have to leave abruptly). They have since been charging me $10/mo for about a year because even though I live out of state they said I have to come in to cancel my membership. I'm not sure this is exactly fair since I live ~300 miles away, but I have tried to cancel numerous times with the same result. Any ideas?

personalfinance,Student in need of loan repayment options,"Hey guys,

I've recently dropped out of college (save the telling me to go back, because I am in no position to right now and it is for personal reasons) and I am looking to start repaying my loans. I have 3 months left on my deferred status and my total principal amount sits around 56,000 - 58,000.

My yearly income is between 45,000 - 50,000 and my monthly rent sits around 800. I also have a car payment of $400 (yes, extremely HIGH interest) but that may be taken care of this summer with a down payment and a new loan.

Basically I've been toying at the idea of debt consolidation but I have been debating on whether or not this is a good idea. I want to pay off these loans as fast as I possibly can without suffocating myself too much with extra interest. Most of my loans have come from the federal loans(roughly half), and the rest are from Sallie Mae(only 1 loan) and Discover Student Loans(about 4 of them). I'm not exactly too spread out to really have a difficult time managing these loans on an individual basis, so I wonder if it's best just to leave things as they are and pay individually.

Or, would it be safer and better for me to do a debt consolidation? I'm worried that say, Sallie Mae will ask a minimum payment of $125 and Discover will ask one of $200, etc, etc... I feel like I'd get effed up pretty quickly in trying to go down this route.

Bitcoin,Who does bitcoin actually affect?,"Warning: I'm 22, barely starting to get educated about personal finance and financial institutions.  I have a minor interest and I haven't studied anything like this before, but...

The way I see it bitcoin basically only affects savings/checking accounts and even then it doesn't change much of anything.  AFAIK most of the adult population has long term savings (stocks/cds/401k) , a credit card, a savings account, and a debit card.  Money comes into the savings account, expenses come into the credit card, and money goes from savings into credit cards, large purchases, and long term savings.  Debit/checking is a useful for ATMs/cash/checks, and as a buffer between your other accounts (increasing your credit line).

Obviously bitcoin has nothing on savings accounts or credit cards, since there is no agency investing or guaranteeing money.  There's no reason to use bitcoin over credit cards, since bitcoins don't and will not offer rewards, and legislation prevents people for charging more for credit (and no store will be willing to give discounts for bitcoin any more than they would be willing to do it for cash).  Even beyond reward schemes, credit is great because you can keep the maximum amount possible in savings.  Bitcoin only has the advantage over debit cards because it eliminates the centralization and monthly fees.  Even then, pretty much everybody will still keep a checkings account for the linking bonus to savings.

Bitcoin won't replace checks until literally everyone is willing to accept them- even a converting agency won't help if people don't trust bitcoins or the person using them.  Cash is different because you can use it at stores- bitcoin could replace that, but if you aren't using a credit card, you wouldn't use bitcoins.  There is no point to a credit card using bitcoins, as the money is already arbitrated by a third party.  

The way I see it the only thing bitcoin truly changes RIGHT NOW is wiring money, by avoiding the clearing houses/fedwire.  Thats fantastic, as the system is hugely expensive, but its not much and its a pain in the butt to withdraw from an account, buy bitcoin, and transfer the bitcoins into another account.

Am I missing something?  Seems to me that the centralization of money that allows banks to offer savings accounts means bitcoins will only ever be as useful as (e)mailing checks.  Nobody hangs on to their own money.",cryptocurrency,1395170103
personalfinance,"I'm using a Dave Ramsey style snowball elimination of debt plan. I have $12,000 right now. Do I pay off my car and be debt free except my house?","Hey Reddit. I've been working extremely hard the last two years to take care of and get out of debt. I hate it. I hate owing money. Plus I like having more of my money. I started out 2 years ago with one credit card at 10,000; another at 2500; and multiple other smaller credit cards that added up to probably 20,000 in CC's alone. Add a 24,000 vehicle loan and a 200,000 mortgage. 

I consolidated my CC's into a personal loan, cut them up and started snowballing debt. I eliminated my personal loan last august. Every dollar I've had has been going to my savings to eventually pay the car off. 

I've finally done it. I have the 12,000 in my bank ready to pay this car off and be debt free except my house. 

Now here is where I'm torn. I still have 3 more years on my car loan. It's 430 bucks a month. I know I've already paid most of the interest, but there's still quite a bit left. I'm working on finishing my basement as well and have stalled that due to saving to pay off the car.

I'm heavily leaning towards paying the car off. What would you do?

**TL;DR I've been working hard on getting rid of my debt. I have 12 GRAND. Do I pay my car off and be free of debt except house? Do I spend that money on my house and continue payments for 3 years?**


EDIT: Forgot to mention. Yes I do have an extra $1000 in a separate emergency fund that is for emergencies. The 12,000 is in savings now because that's where I was storing the money for paying on the car until I reached the full amount. I hadn't fully decided on paying it off yet. Otherwise I would have just been making extra payments each month until now.

Bitcoin,"Seriously..... who has the ponzi scheme going the federal reserve, the bank of England or bitcoin ....","This was written by the bank of England last week

:in other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it's backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There's really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What's more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with ""quantitative easing"" they've been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.""",cryptocurrency,1395181386
personalfinance,Best options for Refinancing home when seperated/Divorced,"Me and my wife are co-borrowers on a home loan. the home value at the time of purchase 460k.

we setup a joint bank account and used that to fund the monthly mortgage payments. both  of us split the mortgage payments. 
Last year,  my wife decided that she doesn't want to pay her share. Leaving no choice , I started making all the mortgage payments and paying bills.

A month ago, My wife suddenly decided that she did not want  to stay with me and was filing for a divorce. She has agreed to move out and I am ok with staying in our current home. 

I have a 6 figure salary and my job is pretty stable.  Just checked my FICO score at Myfico.com and it is over 800.

can someone provide some guidance in such a situation.

-- would selling the home be the best situation here. ?
 
-- if I have to refinance, would I get a rate that is closer to the current 30 year rates.

personalfinance,I am completely financially illiterate and have a math disability. Please direct me to a (simple) great starting point.,"I read the FAQs and this kind of question doesn't appear to be listed, at least to the best of my understanding.

I'm absolutely mortified to be admitting this, and I'm not sure how to articulate any of this to make sure I am making sense to you, so please be gentle.

To avoid a novel, I'll try to make my issue into simple bulletpoints:

-I'm 25 and financially illiterate.

-I have a legitimate math disability (I have the math skills of about a 4th grade level), and I flip/switch numbers (dyscalculia).

-I have severely enmeshed finances with an unstable parent whom I no longer have contact with.

-I have 145K in student loan debt (private and federal) from undergrad and grad (due in part to enmeshed finances with said parent).

-I do not understand any of my loans, nor do I understand the financial lingo of student loans when I try to research them.

-I have a credit card with 2K debt, but I'm not too concerned about that at the moment.

-I only understand the concepts of ""save what you can"", ""put extra money in a savings account"", and ""don't buy what you don't absolutely need on a credit card"".

-I work two jobs, totaling 60 hours a week, so I'm trying the best I can to have money come in.

-I have a lot of questions and would like to have lots of time to ask someone about it. I guess perhaps like some kind of financial tutor?

I am trying to untangle this web, and I think I made a little bit of progress, but I still feel very lost and I am very scared. I know the severity of going default on a loan (which I am about to but thank goodness I have money saved so I have a good chunk of the required amount paid off). I am a very frugal person, but I am having a lot of problems because 1) I don't understand my loan finances and 2) because they are enmeshed with my mom's.

I tried contacting Key Bank (my bank) yesterday to talk about some of this stuff, and they were very kind but they could only talk about so much. At least it was a start.

My loan companies (I have 3) were not particularly helpful because I didn't understand them. I also struggle with talking to someone on the phone because I want to ask ""Wait, what's that word?"" or ""I don't understand what you're saying"", and I don't think they have that much time.

I would do much better with someone in person, one on one, in private sessions. I want to know if there is perhaps a financial counselor type that discusses EVERYTHING financial with you (not just your situation but also financial options), and teaches you everything you need to know, as if you are five years old again. Perhaps like a Sylvan Learning Center tutor for adults in finance? I would like to invest in finding someone along these lines but I'm not sure where the first place to start would even be. 

If it weren't for the enmeshment and loans, I feel like I would be fine money-wise, (I only have credit debt because of the loans), but I still wouldn't understand things such as saving for retirement, stock options, a 401k, etc.

Is there a site or hotline where I could find someone like this and make an appointment to meet with him or her in person? How does this process even work? 

It might seem silly, but this post was a VERY big step for me. I hope I am posting this correctly. If not, please let me know and I will promptly delete this and/or post this elsewhere.

Thank you for your time.

EDIT: Okay, wow! Holy crap this is incredible! These comments are SUPER helpful, and I promise I will respond more to them when I have a larger period of time. 

My confidence has SOARED since reading all the great things from everyone, and I feel that perhaps I'm not as financially illiterate and math disabled as I thought I was. I guess I was feeling insecure because I've lurked here before and didn't understand a lot of the posts. I feel as if this sub is better than a counselor of some sort!

I also want to clear a few things up:

Just because someone has degrees does not mean that the person is exempt from being ignorant in other areas. For all you know, my masters could be in underwater basket weaving. It's not (actually elementary ed), but I think you get the gist. It's also a bit more challenging to be knowledgable on a topic like finances when it's never been exposed to you and ESPECIALLY if your parents have significantly screwed up finances. After all, we often only know what we see and are exposed to. 

We need to take accountability at some point, obviously, and cannot blame our childhood, school curriculums, credit cards, and whatever else for our financial issues. It's just sad and frustrating to be figuring out such a crucial thing such as how to support yourself without debt when we tend to be exposed to some pretty frivolous (at least in my opinion) things in school (including some core courses in college).",finance,1395187200

This guy is loaded and the ticker for their company will be on the LSE this year sometime. At first we thought the company was bought to be shelfed just for the advertising app I showed earlier. After todays run and going through the filings we were wrong. The new board of directors and World Global Networks are all from well established fortune 500 companies or they have extremely crazy resumes.

Guys this is very preliminary because it had to be put out to our group. There has been no formal PR release about the purchase and today volume of 60 million was astronomical with a 400 percent increase and at one point saw a 528% increase. Me and Dave played this one today and before we gave to the group wanted to see if it was what we thought it was. This was an extremely risky play and couldn't give to group and watch us all get burned.

PLEASE DO YOUR OWN DD IMO this is just the beginning of run sinc eno PR is released and the company is essentialy same name as their European counterpart. @ tickers in 2 countries, Fabio may be a genius but hes also loaded. This is under everyones radar today but wont be tomorrow. Their was nothing on reddit, no news outlets, and even twitter was pretty quiet about it. **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**.. But this run happened with no formal PR and just filings quietly disclosed to public. I was lucky enough to spot a weird volume trend.

I have no idea what this will do but im in for the ride and literally I have no idea where it can go.

personalfinance,Short Term Investment Advice,"I have approximately $80k I want to invest.  I anticipate I will need the money in about three years for a down payment on a house.

A few months back I met with a financial advisor and he suggested dividing the money between index funds and floating rate bonds.
Last week I spoke with him again and he suggested that I divide the money equally between a lower-risk bond fund (such as Nuveen Limited Term Municipal Bond Fund (FLTDX)) and a higher-risk unit investment trust (such as First Trust’s Equity Income Select Series 38).
In the Nuveen fund, the average annualized returns for a three year investment with sales charges was 2.49%, which doesn’t seem like a great return for a three year investment.

Likewise, the unit investment trust has a 1% initial Sales Charge and 2.45% deferred sales charge, which I think is a lot of fees for the investment term.

The advisor also told me that he is paid a percentage of the funds’ sales charges.

These funds seem like ok suggestions but they also carry sales charges/fees that are fairly high. 

Questions

How do you think the advisor’s suggestions compare to something less actively managed, like ETFs/index funds?  For the lower-risk option, what do you think about floating rate bond funds this year, given that interest rates are likely to rise? 

The suggestions he provided last week vs two months ago seem much different.  Should I be worried about his sudden change of tune?

&gt;I have invested in some bitcoins myself, and find it fascinating how a whole new global currency has been created. For people who can afford to invest a little in bitcoins, it’s worth looking into.

&gt;Those of us that understand that Bitcoin has the potential to change money forever. If you believe that a decentralized digital currency, free from government corruption and controlled by the masses is the future – then you’re in this camp. This is no easy road, there are going to be sell-offs, attempted regulation, and major unforeseen disasters. It’s not for the faint of heart. We could and probably will lose everything, but IF we pull this off, the results will be unlike anything we’ve ever seen.

Bitcoin,Let's get Norman Goldman to cover Bitcoin! (AM Radio show host across U.S.),"The Norman Goldman Show (http://www.normangoldman.com/) is one of my favorite programs, and practically the only AM news show I listen to.  His ""senior legal analyst"" coverage on Bitcoin would bring the idea to tens (or even hundreds) of thousands of new patriotic, libertarians that are looking for things like this that can help with freedom of speech, and freedom of money.  Here is the letter I wrote to him on his facebook page... I encourage you to visit this page (https://www.facebook.com/normangoldman/posts/820956231252619), and like or comment on my post!!!  Let's make this happen!

Hi Norman!  I’m one of your many Denver fans, and also at the very top-end demographic of the “millennial generation”…. Age 32.  You’re growing a younger audience of patriots and I thank you for bringing some sanity to the airwaves.  I listen to your show every day (while I drive an hour in traffic) and absolutely love it.  You are the only reason I listen to AM radio, and I learn so much on the various topics you cover that encompass everything from our civics classes, politics, corruption, international news, and even simple things like aging.  I began listening when I was looking for answers to the insanity, back when the Republicans shut the government down in October 2013.  You spoke my mind and I was hooked right away.  I’ve learned a lot from your show and want to give back by taking an evening to write to you about something you and your audience should be paying close attention to…

It is clear that your audience of listeners is educated, astute, international, and values freedom, justice, equality, and empowering the voice of the people so that they can be heard.  We are the freedom fighters… and Bitcoin is the modern day embodiment of that spirit, and also similar to the Wild Wild West.  Well, I can’t think of a better group of open-minded individuals than you and The Norman Goldman audience to begin discussing the phenomena that is Bitcoin.  I’m sure you’ve heard of it in the news (probably in a negative light, as that’s what grabs headlines and sells content).  

Now, before you stop reading, I’m not here to sway you or your audience one way or another… I would simply greatly appreciate it if you could add some unbiased coverage on this topic, as it is largely misunderstood.  There are MANY angles to cover on Bitcoin, and it can’t easily be compared to tangible things (other than the invention of the printing press, perhaps).  Bitcoin is the world’s first global socio-economic experiment, so therefore I think that it is a qualified topic for “Senior Legal Analyst” segments, especially in how different countries are trying to grapple with how to handle and regulate Bitcoin.  The news coverage on this topic is happening fast, and regulating Bitcoin could ultimately determine if its fate is widely adopted, or pushed into the hands of criminals (as no government can simply make this technology go away).  Regulators are debating… Is it a currency?  Is it a commodity?  How do we tax it?  How do we regulate it without stifling American innovation (job creation)?  Bitcoin is something new altogether… a “crypto-currency”, or as some would call it “e-gold”.  A marvel of the modern world, Bitcoin is the only digital creation that cannot be copied (like cash), and has a finite supply (like gold… but not like our fiat economy which could eventually collapse with so much inflation). 

The reason you should be interested are numerous, but here are some highlights:
-	Bitcoin is an open source, decentralized system – no country, company, or person can control it.  In other words, it’s here to stay… like HTTP (the Internet protocol), and SMTP (email protocol).  It is a technology standard that is owned by no one and maintained through open source software development. This is as democratic, libertarian, and anti-establishment as you can get.

-	Bitcoin empowers people… All over the world.  Anyone can take a payment from anyone else… no 3rd party (i.e. Visa, PayPal, Bank of America) needs to be involved, scraping off a hefty cut. 

-	Bitcoin transcends language, currency conversion, the Fed’s manipulation of the money supply, and any kind of intervention with the Free Market or Free Speech.  This will lift people out of poverty, allow more of the peoples voice to be heard (amongst the corporate-controlled media outlets) and level the playing field for any small business.

-	Bitcoin is a public ledger that can also transfer property, stocks, deeds, votes, and even combats fraud!  Every transaction is traced, and with new businesses working out 3rd party escrow services for Bitcoin transactions, there will be even more ways to leverage this technology for trade and commerce.

-	Bitcoin startups have received over $100 million in Venture Capital already.  Bitcoin has an $8 billion market cap that is expected to grow as high as $50 billion this year alone by some industry analysts.  The potential is in the trillions (see industries below)

-	Bitcoin will likely revolutionize the following industries/events in the next 3-5 years:

 --	Banking.  Why pay a bank fees, wait days for transactions to process, when you can do it for next to nothing in seconds?

 --	Credit Cards – Bitcoin is deflationary currency, designed to increase in value.  It promotes saving money by design, rather than spending dollars before they lose more value. 

 --	Stock Market – Bitcoin Investment trusts will hit Wall Street later this year.  There’s already some Bitcoin businesses that are publicly traded.

 --	ForEx &amp; Exchange Rates

 --	Paying for Use of Copyrighted Media (News article, Magazine article, Podcast episode?) with microtransactions 

 --	Add-Free Internet with microtransactions

 --	Mobile Payments (across any device)

 --	Peer-To-Peer selling (eBay/PayPal/Craigslist)

 --	Donations / Rallies – Anonymous; send money to people you don’t know anything about… just a sign with a QR code that they’re holding up.

 ---	civil unrest / Ukraine

 ---	Occupy Wall Street 2?

 --	China.  They are flocking to this like… well you get the picture.

The mainstream media is simply not getting this, and coverage on this topic is flawed.  Some examples that are detracting from the real news:

-	Newsweek claims that the face behind the originator, Satoshi Nakamoto is “exposed” – yet the originator is meaningless to Bitcoin’s impacts on people’s lives (and many believe they got it wrong anyways)

-	Warren Buffet fundamentally misunderstands what Bitcoin actually is and is advising people to stay away (no surprise here, but this isn’t good for mainstream media coverage)

-	The collapse of Mt. Gox is the collapse of Bitcoin – not true either.  That is one out of many bitcoin exchanges, and was totally mismanaged… the Bitcoin 2.0 businesses are emerging while the Bitcoin 1.0 businesses fail.  Again, this is survival of the fittest, and there is no government bail-out for practicing bad business practices

Norm, if you’re still reading this and are interested in covering Bitcoin, I would even go so far as to send you a small amount to show you how it works… I think it would be fun to demonstrate the power of the donation concept first-hand.  You’ll just need to create a wallet (free… I like coinbase.com) and post your QR-code somewhere I can see it (Facebook works), in order to receive donations.  Jimmy Wales (co-founder of Wikipedia), was just tweeting that he was looking into Bitcoin and the community quickly donated to him over $11,000 in a few days to show him the potential.  Overstock.com’s CEO has already generated over $1m in new business by accepting Bitcoin, and is now paying employees with it.  The Bitcoin community is a libertarian and patriotic group that will rally behind anyone that supports the same principles that they stand for: freedom, transparency, and empowerment.",cryptocurrency,1395204896
personalfinance,I have a general plan...looking for some fine-tuning,"First of all, big shout out to you guys for helping me begin my path to financial independence. Been lurking here, /r/studentloans, and /r/investing for a while and have come up with the following plan. 

 The Man: 
I'm one year removed from undergrad from a prestigious private university (read: I have student loans). During this gap year I've been volunteering to pad my resume and applying to STEM PhD programs. I'll be earning 23K/yr pre-tax for the next 5 years while earning my PhD (wohoo!), likely followed by 40-60k/yr post-doc for 2-5 yr, and finally 80-120k/yr after that. 

The Debt ($39k at various rates):

* $24k government unsubsidized loan at 6.55%
* $171 government subsidized loan at 5.35%
* $2k government subsidized loan at 4.25%
* $3k governement subsidized loan at 3.15%
* $3k private loan at 7.4%
* $6.4k private loan at 4.5%

The Plan:
By the time I start earning my 23k (July), I will have about $4k in my savings account. I'll need this for a cross country move and to cover my first months' expenses. As a graduate student, I will have no monthly minimums on federal loans. Further, I am *eligible* for $20k/yr in federal unsubsidized loans at 5-6ish% while in graduate school. I plan to use $10k to eliminate my private loans, and borrow little to nothing on top of that. I will pay at least the interest on these federal loans, interest that would otherwise capitalize when i'm through with school. Everyone with me? 

Fast forward to next Fall: Once I refill my emergency account to 4-5k, I'm left with a dilemma on what to do with excess monthly income (haha, excess income). Do I save up 3k to open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard or do I start to pay off my loans? I can draw from this IRA without penalty after 5 years for a down payment on my first home. I would need to set up this account during the 2014 tax year in order to be able to withdraw these funds without penalty when I'm through with grad school in 5 years. 

I was even considering taking an extra 3k from my graduate student federal loan to ensure that I can open this IRA. Is this a completely bone-headed move? Roth IRA accounts typically have a &gt;6% yearly return don't they???

China hasn’t found evidence that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ever entered its territory. [WSJ](http://on.wsj.com/1osxClu)

**8:10 AM UTC / 4:10 PM MYT - 21st MEDIA STATEMENT**

&gt; The passengers and crew on-board flight MH370, their families and loved ones, have been at the centre of every action Malaysia Airlines has taken as a Company since we first learned the flight disappeared.
&gt; 
&gt; The Malaysian Government is coordinating an unprecedented international search effort covering 2.24 million square nautical miles. With this simply enormous area we cannot determine how long it will take to locate the aircraft.
&gt; 
&gt; Considering these challenges, our caregivers have informed the family members of the missing passengers and crew that we have taken the decision to continue to provide information and assistance through the further enhanced Family Support Centre (FSC) based in Kuala Lumpur which has been operational since 8 March 2014 rather than the various Family Assistance Centers (FACs).
&gt; 
&gt; The Family Support Centre will continue to proactively provide relatives waiting for news at home with daily updates. In addition to personal phone calls, Malaysia Airlines will now send out SMS blasts with brief updates to the families. We have also set up an email address for family members as a channel for them to communicate with us. Updates via the Malaysia Airlines website are also available.
&gt; 
&gt; This Family Support Centre will be open round-the-clock and will house family support representatives trained to assist those who are seeking answers and further information. The representatives will be divided into four shifts with ten staff handling each shift. This will ensure that someone is available to attend to the families at all times. The centre will also have Mandarin speaking personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; Below are the toll-free numbers that has been set-up for eight different countries. A back-up number is also given to the families in the event they are not able to reach the toll-free number. The number to call to get in touch with this centre is +603 8777 5770.
&gt; 
&gt; |**Countries**|**Toll-free number**|
&gt; |:--|:--|
&gt; |China|10-800-130-1364 (South China) / 10-800-713-1404 (North China)|
&gt; |Malaysia|1800-81-4819|
&gt; |Indonesia|001-803-015-203-7708|
&gt; |Australia|1800-198-163|
&gt; |US/Canada|877-504-4210|
&gt; |New Zealand|080-045-4029|
&gt; |India|000-800-100-3449|
&gt; |France|080-091-2622|
&gt; 
&gt; All this while, the families have always been briefed first, followed by the media and then the public whenever new information surfaces. However, the often conflicting information and wild speculation have caused a major distress to the families.
&gt; 
&gt; The Airline continues to work closely with the authorities and we appreciate the help we are receiving from all local and international agencies during this critical and traumatic period.
&gt; 
&gt; Our top priority remains to provide any and all assistance to the families of the passengers and crew.

What would happen if the fed -doesn't- raise interest rates? What does this do to the economy?

personalfinance,5% down PMI free loan or save .4 percent?,"I am in negotiations for my first house (woot!).  I have an offer for a PMI free loan if I put 5% down.  I am just a bit shy of 20% saved up.  The rate on this loan would be around 4.65%.  I have a feeling I could get a loan w/o the PMI free w/ 4.25%.  At this moment it would probably take me another 3 months or so to have enough cash on hand that I feel comfortable w/ putting 20% towards the house.  Also, if I do this 5% down instead w/o the PMI, I can put this extra cash I have towards my student loans that are around 6.5%.

So two different loans on the table:

One is I put 5% down and don't have a PMI w/ an interest rate ~4.65%.  I currently have about ~19% saved.  With this loan I would be able to have more cash on hand, and also apply quite a bit towards my student loan debt which is at 6.25%.

The other would be a loan be a normal loan w/ a PMI but the interest rate would most likely be 4.25%.  I would not be able to pay off the 20% immediately, but could in the near future.  I also would have a lot less cash on hand and would not be able to pay down my student loan debt.

Right now the house is worth much less than that, estimates around $65k. I owe $74k. It is not my primary residence - I have tenants whose rent covers my loan+hoa fees and management costs. I have no plans to get rid of it within the next 5 years, considering the current LTV.

I have been looking and only found one company willing to do the HARP 2.0 refinance but I am not sure if it is worth it. Getting a new 30-year loan for simply a lower payment doesn't make much sense to me considering I have 7 years into the loan, most of which I've been paying an extra $50 towards the principal. Not much but it should help some.. 

Does it make sense to get a new 30-year loan but keep the same payment amount, putting the difference towards paying down the principal? Or does a 15-year with a lower interest rate but same payment a better idea? This is what I really need your help on.

It is important to point out that the satellite imagery of the objects released by Australia are four days old. They are dated Sunday 16 March. 

In ASMA GM's media statement, suggested the authorities have taken their time to analyse the images before stating that they could have been debris from MH370. 

To repeat he said: “RCC Australia received an expert assessment of commercial satellite imagery on Thursday.”

“The images were captured by satellite. They may not be related to the aircraft. [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/20/mh370-two-possible-objects-may-have-been-found-in-australian-search-zone#block-532aa226e4b015397016d563)

Press statement from Malaysian Defence Minister.

&gt;At 10:00 this morning, Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Najib Razak received a call from Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia, informing him that ‘two possible objects related to the search’ for MH370 had been identified in the Southern Indian Ocean. The Australian High Commissioner has also briefed me on the situation.
&gt;
&gt;At this stage, Australian officials have yet to establish whether these objects are indeed related to the search for MH370.

To see how the search has now been narrowed this is the revised search zone that was being examined on Wednesday:

John Young - Australian Maritime Safety Authority

- All times are in Canberra Time
- Coordinating Southern Corridor search with assistance from RNZAF, US Navy
- Satellite imagery has been received. RCC Australia conducted an assessment.
- Image is in vicinity of search area. Further images are expected after commercial satellites were redirected to take high quality images. Will be provided in due course.
- Images taken 2500 km SW of Perth - 4 aircraft repositioned.
- Orion arrived at 1:50 pm. 3 more aircraft are tasked to arrive. US P-8, another Orion. P-8 is on scene now. Second Orion will arrive on scene at 6 pm. New Zealand Orion will depart at 4 pm and will be on scene 8 pm. RAAF C-130 has been tasked to drop data marker buoys. 
- HMAS Success fleet oiler ship en route to area - will take some days to reach.
- Focus of AMSA - continue search with all available ships and aircraft. Grave concern for passengers and crew onboard.
- Weather: moderate in the Southern Indian Ocean. But poor visibility has been reported. Weather ""not playing.""
- Objects may be not from MH 370 and may be difficult to find.
- Full statement can be read [here](http://journalists.medianet.com.au/Release.aspx?R=797890&amp;amp;K=5478873)

Q&amp;amp;A

- Objects are indistinct on imagery. They are ‘credible sightings.’ Objects that are of reasonable size and are awash with water.

- Size of the objects: largest object is assessed as being 24 meters (78.74 feet) long ""blob"".
- 1:50 pm: Orion reported the weather on scene. No debris sightings.
- Merchant ship: most likely scenario is if an aircraft finds an object, it will mark the area with GPS and the ship will be sent to investigate the area.
- Satellite imagery is progressively provided to AMSA. Discovered to reveal a possible object part of a possible debris field.
- This is credible enough to divert research to this area on the basis that it provides a promising lead that this may be a debris field. May not be related to the search even if debris looks “good.”
- Water may be several thousand meters deep.
- The area is 4 hours flying time for the P3. Aircraft can search for about 2 hours due to fuel load.
- Advice for families: AMSA is doing its very best to find any possible survivors IF the aircraft came into the southern corridor and IF the objects are indeed the aircraft

Winners 

Putin

Putin has consolidated his already high approval ratings and strong power base within Russia as a result of his actions in Crimea.

Putin has also consolidated his power base among the oligarchs and power elites in Russia.

Putin gave the nod to his top cronies in Russia before he intervened in Crimea. E.G. the head of Gazprom sold ALL his sizable shareholding in the company a week or two prior to Russia's military intervention in Crimea.

The obvious message that Putin is sending out to the rich and powerful in Russia, is that working closely WITH Putin is worth their while and not working closely with him will cost them money. (The rich and powerful in Russia already knew this - but it's always worthwhile sending out pertinent reminders every so often.)

The stock market fall in Russia won't of affected Putin's inner clique much at all.
I wonder if anyone benefited by actually shorting Russian shares? (Shorting is betting that share prices will fall.)

American Neocons and Warmongers

The Neocons are using the American engineered crisis in Ukraine as an excuse to escalate global tensions and even start another major war or cold war with Russia.

Ukraine : US officials and US media go bat shit crazy over Russian interference in Crimea http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukraine-us-officials-and-us-media-go.html

Neocon William Kristol wants the US to start a war against someone .... anyone! http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/03/17/bill-kristol-calls-for-americans-to-be-awakened-and-rallied-to-war/

Israel is also trying to goad America into war, for the benefit of Israel and the certain detriment of over 99% of Americans. http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-israel-usa-idUSBREA2H0SV20140318

Arms Companies 

Calls to cut back on America's current astronomical level of arms spending (over $1tn a year) will now be more muted - not that there was much in the first place.

There may even be calls to increase it in the near future ""to counter the Russian threat"".

It's Cold War mentality and deeply against the interests of over 99% of Americans, but it usually works on a hugely gullible and ignorant American public. 

Arms sales to the rest of the world are also likely to significantly increase if the Neocons succeed in engendering a new Cold War type mentality.

NSA and CIA

Calls to defund the NSA and to control the CIA will now be more mooted.

Who in Congress is now going to speak out against the recently revealed (to the mainstream) criminal activities of the intelligence agencies in the face of this new escalation with Russia?
At the very least the American engineered Ukrainian crisis will distract from the crimes of the CIA and the NSA.

Maybe the CIA and NSA should concentrate on spying on Russia, to glean Putin's intentions before he acts, instead of spying on Congress and the American people.
Maybe they already did and knew that Putin wouldn't take a coup in Ukraine lying down.
Either way it does not put the intelligence agencies in a very good light (but it is very doubtful that anybody in the mainstream is actually going to come out and say it.)

Just like 9/11 and Boston were massive intelligence failures and if the intelligence services were actually doing their supposed job of protecting Americans, they would never have been allowed to happen.

Republican Party Establishment

(See Democrat Party below.)

The Neocons who completely dominate the Republican Party Establishment will benefit from the renewed spirit of warmongering which is being encouraged in the Corporate owned and controlled media.  
Recent polls were indicating that Americans were getting fed up with the endless wars and multiple interventions in numerous countries.

The number of instances of warmongering Neocons being treated as sane policy makers (rather than the insane people they actually are) has dramatically increased, e.g. on MSNBC in recent months.
E.G. John McCain, American Enterprise Institute, Brookings Institute, ex-advisors to McCain etc.

Losers

Barack Obama

Barack Obama is being portrayed as spineless and weak in a lot of the media.

A lot of it will stick among Independent voters - the only people that count in an election.

It will stick because it is true (but not in the way that the Neocon Corporatists like John McCain portray).

Barack Obama has never stood up against the big banks, the arms companies, big oil, big pharma, Monsanto etc. He has never stood up for, or worked for, the American people.

He is a spineless puppet for Big Corporate and Big Money interests .

The Neocons also portrayed Obama as weak when he did not pursue the Neocon agenda for overt full scale war in Syria for the benefit of Saudi Arabia, Israel, the arms companies and big oil.

He backed down in the face of overwhelming public opinion against war in Syria, a lack of international support - even the UK government could not hoodwink their Parliament enough to authorize it and he was going to lose the vote in Congress if he had pursued it.

Democrat Party 

The Democrat Party will lose further support from Independents in the 2014 mid-term elections.

Independents are the largest demographic at 40% of the electorate.

Democrat candidates were already up against it because of the slow-motion train-wreck that is Obamacare, which Obama continues to try and run from by delaying the fines for not being Obamacare covered.
See the recent result in Florida.

The young who were conned by Obama's empty and meaningless rhetoric in 2008 are starting to smell a rat in the face of the overwhelming evidence that Obama has reneged on numerous campaign promises.
He has just continued the disastrous economic policies of GW Bush and massively expanded the Mass Surveillance State.

Barack Obama : A Gigantic Fraud upon the American People http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/barack-obama-gigantic-fraud-upon.html

The economy is already sinking like a stone and despite the media headlines unemployment is going up, particularly among the young.

Ukrainian People 

The Ukrainian people are certainly going to be worse off as a result of the American intervention in the domestic affairs and Coup D'Etat in their country.

This is not exactly unusual - see Iraq, Libya, Syria etc.
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukraine-us-officials-and-us-media-go.html

Ukraine is already poor with a per capita income of only $6,500 a year.

It already had extreme difficulty in paying it's bills, e.g. the $2bn or so owed to Gazprom.

Russia had given Ukraine a 33% discount on it's gas - nearly half of it's energy supply.

Russia is likely to withdraw this discount, which will lead to the impoverishment of Ukrainians and have a severe detrimental effect on Ukrainian industry (they will be forced to pay market rates or 50% more for their gas). 

Ukraine's industry is very inefficient and relies on exports to Russia (the only country willing to buy it's steel products). These have now been put at risk, through higher energy costs and e.g. via new Russian trade tariffs.

Unemployment in Ukraine will no doubt rise as a result of American actions (the American actions were never designed to benefit the people of Ukraine).

Ukraine has now lost the very significant gas reserves in the Black Sea around Crimea, which it could of used to revamp it's economy. Exxon and Chevron were planning to put up $1bn as an initial investment for exploratory drilling.

The story sold to poorer countries that joining the EU will provide benefits and better job prospects might of been superficially and temporarily true when Poland joined the EU in 2004.
It no longer is. See Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Cyprus, among several other countries that are in deep economic trouble.
The EU is bankrupt with massive and rising National Debts, over 500 insolvent banks and massively high unemployment - an average of 12%. 

I very much doubt that the German people are going to be overly enamored with helping Ukraine - they are already crying foul from the continuing bail outs to the rest of the Eurozone.",energy,1395253846

One of my biggest problems in figuring out where to start to get help or figure out what my options are. Doing blind google searches for something I know nothing about is not helping at all.

I could give details but its not really about that. I have a good job. I am pretty frugal on my spending. And I have a massive amount of dept. Just about 90% of it is student dept. I went to college, made some bad decisions but stayed with it so I could get a good job when I graduated, and I did.

After graduating I concentrated really hard to find a good paying job. It took me about a year, when I got it I was so exhausted I just worked for a few months. To be honest I waited to long and now some of my college loans are in default and coming after me for money. Some are garnishing my wages, hence the lost feeling I’m going through.

I just don’t know where to start with anything. I’ve tried calling a few places. What they say is that they want money, they want more money! Why am I not paying them? And then the next place says the same thing, and the next. I obviously have only so much money, and need to be able to support myself. 

But I don’t know what else to do. I don’t know where to go for help. I don’t know how to find an advisor. Is a dept or credit advisor such a thing? I don’t want to pay to have someone help me if I shouldn’t. I’ve read bad things about consolidating my loans and I don’t know what to do. I have some private and some through the gov. I don’t want to loose the low interest rate I have on most all of them. Is there a free service? A national one I can call to deal with or should I look locally? Should I try and take a class or something to figure it out? I’m not opposed to putting in time. I just hate having to call these places and getting the same whats wrong with you comments. I’m trying to figure this out. I Don’t know what to do.

After starting to look at houses, getting yearly car inspections, and doing some math with my wife, we decided to forego the newer car and focus on a house. We've saved up half a down payment (instead of paying off the student loans early) and are considering making an offer on a house.

Financially, an interest rate of ~3.5% 15yr or %4.5~ 30 year is less than 6.8% for the student loans, so as soon as a house is closed on, paying off the student loans will be priority again, and a baby.

Our total assets $185,000. Our total debts $150,000. (difference $35,000)

Breakdown:

$6,000 in cash, checking and savings accounts, CCs, basically all the places we pay for things out of. We never keep a CC balance, always pay off, and this system works for us.

$10,000 in a money market as our emergency fund, we don't touch this.

$140,000 in mutual funds 401k's and IRAs. I loaded mine up early and don't want to touch these until retirement. Wife is not contributing and I have my employment contract to get about $7,000 in IRA yearly, no matching just a fixed amount.

$25,000 additional in savings. Most of this was a gift to buy a new vehicle. More on this later.

The ($150,000) debt is wife's student loans. These started at close to $300,000 2 years ago, so we've been killing these hard, most 6.5% loans, highest interest first. No other debts at all, cars are low maintenance cost and low insurance cost.

Income: take home pay monthly between us $8,000.

Expenses: Averaging $3,000 monthly including $1200 rent and required student loan payments. Our budget is very tight and we're doing good with that. It will be really nice once the loan is gone and we can not worry about going out to eat.


Changing gears. We want to have a baby and get a house instead of renting. The student loans could be paid off in about 2 years if we kept up the momentum. We decided to postpone the extra payments now and get a house now.

The $25,000 (part of which was a gift for a newer car) can be used as a down payment. If we can, we'd like to use it for a newer vehicle to honor the intention of the gift. If we start looking for a house now, we'll need twice that, $50,000 for a 20% down payment for the lowest price house we are willing to look at in the area. We'll save $5,000 a month for the next 5 months instead of paying extra into student loans to get our down payment. We'll go month to month on our lease which will increase rent $50.

At that point in 5 months if we found a house for $250,000 we have the down payment, can get a mortgage that is close to our rent cost now and pay down the student loans again (minus baby and new house costs). If we find a used car in the $20,000 range we can buy it then as well.

We plan to start looking at houses now, hoping to buy in 5 months. If we don't find a place we like or realize we need more capital, each month will add $5,000 to our down payment so we can look higher as needed within reason.

Does this make sense to you? Have anything you would do differently or ideas? Glad to hear them. Thanks!",finance,1395268049

I am 25, and I will be making 50k in base salary a year living in a medium sized urban area, with housing costing around 1k a month. I have car expenses of about $300 per month, $100 cell phone, $100 health insurance, and possibly a couple other small fixed expense that I may be forgetting. 


Savings:
I have 401k matching program with 3% at 100% and the next 3% at 50%. If I save the 6% it will be about $190 per month. 

Debt: 
No credit card debt
42k in student loans. All federal half in subsidized and half in unsubsidized. I haven't gotten the complete info on the student loans but I believe their interest rates are in the 4-6 percent range. 

My question is about what I should focus on for the next couple of years. My job is going to include a pretty sizable amount of commission. 

Should I always have the 401k at 6%? should I pay off the student loan before starting to save in the 401k? When should I set up an emergency fund (before or after student loan is paid off)?

investing,Should I sell off my emerging market ETF?,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a critique of my thesis on emerging markets.

After noticing the currency turmoil in Turkey, South Africa, and other emerging markets (EMs) in late January, I decided to load up on EEM and FM and they now account for almost half my LT portfolio. 

my rationale was as follows:

* EEMs are dirt cheap. P/E for MSCI EMs is 11.9; P/E for S&amp;P 500 is 17.7. Forward P/E for MSCI EMs is 9.9; Forward P/E for S&amp;P 500 is 15.53. 
* I felt that the shock of tapering had worn off and bargain investors were bound to move in
* I'm a firm believer that things have a way of fixing themselves. Financial crisis, Greek crisis, Cypriot crisis, Syrian war, Russian invasions, Argentine defaults, terrorist attacks...the market has recovered from everything. So what's to stop EMs from recovering?

It's obviously too early to be panicking (I'm not) especially in light of the Ukrainian developments, but I'm starting to question my wisdom with EMs as outlined above. I've always known that EEM has been an exceptionally shitty investment since 2011. I've known that EM funds have seen massive withdrawals, and the entire mood surrounding EMs remains bearish. But how much longer can this last? Is this lull permanent? I am genuinely concerned that the only reason EMs have eked out some of its meagre gains since 2012 has to do entirely with fed stimulus.

Is there something I'm not seeing? Are emerging markets last decade's investment? Or will patience pay the bills as it did with American equities?

news,The Avanti Law Group: Legal Fraud of the Century,"There are plenty of candidates for that title, but after Tuesday the prize belongs to attorney Steven Donziger. Federal judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that the environmental activist had engaged in a massive racketeering scheme and declared that a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron CVX -0.89% in an Ecuadorian court cannot be enforced in the United States.

As our readers know, in 1993 Mr. Donziger sued Texaco (now merged with Chevron) for what he said was the company's failure to clean up oil pits it drilled in Lago Agrio in the 1970s with state oil company PetroEcuador. Chevron had signed proof that it had cleaned its portion of the pits and had been absolved of any liability, but Mr. Donziger sniffed the potential windfall of a media-ready environmental ""disaster"" and sued the company for $113 billion. He enlisted all manner of celebrity helpers, including actress Daryl Hannah.

He won in Ecuador, but only thanks to what Judge Kaplan found were ""dishonest and corrupt"" measures including bribery, coercion and engaging an American consulting firm to ghostwrite an independent expert's reports. In a 485-page opinion, the judge called the case ""extraordinary,"" calling the actions of Mr. Donziger and his legal team ""offensive to the laws of any nation that aspires to the rule of law, including Ecuador."" The corrupt extortion was intended to ""instill fear of a catastrophic outcome in order to increase the amount Chevron would pay to avoid the worst,"" Judge Kaplan wrote.

Chevron refused to give in, and now the case may serve as an example of how companies can fight back if they have the nerve and the cash. Mr. Donziger says he'll appeal, but on the factual record he stands discredited. Another worthy casualty may be financially strapped Washington law firm Patton Boggs, which got involved on behalf of Burford Capital's BUR.LN -0.44% effort to provide litigation financing to the plaintiffs. Tuesday's opinion means the firm won't collect any plunder, which couldn't happen to a nicer crowd.

Mr. Donziger is a pioneer of the foreign environmental tort, trying to exploit Third World juries to bleed U.S. companies regardless of the merits. We're glad to see his dishonesty face American justice. `",energy,1395282089

personalfinance,Should I use part of my inherited IRA to pay off my student debt?,"My dad died four years ago (as of yesterday, actually, weird) and left me with a nice sum of money -- approximately 250k from his trust and an inherited IRA (that was passed down to him from his parents) worth approximately 270k. Unfortunately, both my father and his trustee, my uncle, had/have a thing against private colleges and refused to pay the full cost of my tuition, leaving me with approximately 80k of student debt (private loans) upon graduation. 

There are allotments in the trust for other expenses, like 25k for a car (that I don't need, I have a perfectly functioning car that only needs the occasional service/repair) that I'd ideally like to repurpose towards paying off my student loans, but my uncle's standing pretty firm with the ""You knew we didn't approve of your choice of college when you went"" point of view and the full amount of the trust isn't released from the trustee to me until I'm 45, so getting my hands on it seems like a moot point for now.

So that leaves me with the inherited IRA, over which I have full control. The money is appropriately invested and yielding returns. But my question is this: would it be worth pulling out the 80k I need to just abolish my student debt, with all the income tax pulling it out would entail? The interest rate for my private loans are pretty steep (between 7 and 9%), so getting rid of them ASAP is incredibly appealing, but I feel like I'd just end up paying the same amount overall when factoring in taxes. But the idea of not having student loan debt any more...it's tempting.

personalfinance,Used Car Auto Loan. Bad Credit.,"Hey folks

I'm in the beginning stages of looking for a car. My credit score is pretty bad, ~590 on a good day. I have debts in collections that I need to pay off, and I am in the process of contacting agencies to set up payment plans. Once all is said and done, I anticipate that roughly $150.00 of my monthly income will go toward paying off debts in collection. My monthly net income is $2750.00, and I do not pay rent or have other expenses aside from phone bill (~$110/mo) and commute (~$60/wk).

I need to buy a car for work; I just got a new job after a few weeks of unemployment and about a year of underemployment. Because of this situation, I do not have any money in savings which makes it difficult to put money down on a car. I applied for a loan pre-approval from CapOne which I was awarded with very high interest rates ($12k / 11.5 APR). 

My questions are as follows: 

* Should I shop around for a better pre-approved rate? 
* Should I finance (is it possible to?) the entire vehicle? 

(NB: I realize cars are depreciating assets, as soon as I have one, I will be able to, and intend to, pick up side jobs such as catering / tutoring / etc to pay as down the principal as soon as possible)

* General advice for a first time car buyer?

For reference, the car I am looking at is a 2011 with 37k mi. Clean carfax. KBB value $14,000. List price $12,500. Total price $13,700.

Let me know if you'd like more info or if there is anything that I need to consider that I haven't included.

Thanks for any advice or assistance.

hydro,"Lesson learned on ""damping off""...","Hey all,

I was propegating some veggies in a slab of rockwool cubes in a tray with a humidome and a warming pad.  

All the radishes sprouted in 48 hours, and the next day I moved them directly to the baskets to avoid putting the rockwool under the HID lamp and causing algae growth.

I got a bit excited and thinned them out once their seedling leaves filled out a bit.  Probably should have at least waited until they had true leaves.  Either way, one of the cubes had 3 in it, so I thinned two, but accidentally damaged the 3rd.

While working on my NFT setup I lost another from being knocked onto the floor.  I put those two cubes back in the tray and reseeded, the mistake I made here was not learned until about a week later.

A couple days after I reseeded those radishes I started noticing wilting and whithering seedlings.  Swiss Chard was hit hard, probably 2/3 affected.  The tomato seedlings were about 1/2 hit.  The Kholerabi probably lost at least 1/2, if not 2/3.  And since the spinach was just getting ready to sprout, I've yet to learn of how it was affected.

At first I chalked it up to leaving the warming pad unplugged overnight as I'd borrowed it's outlet while testing a pump for my NFT.  It was a cold night outside, so in the basement it dropped down to probably 60F.

Today though the wilting was more apparent, and it was only while reading up on growing Marigolds did I learn about ""damping off"".

Damping off is a term for the wilting, withering, wasting, of seedlings upon germination.  It's usually caused by mold or fungus, and made worse by high humidity, low temperatures, or poor drainage.

I set about correcting the situation by thinning out anything that looked affected with tweezers to extract the roots.  It was a bit of a bad day on Black Rock, but I learned a few things about plant biology and pest control.  When I reached the radish cube I'd reseeded I discovered that the seeds had simply fed the beast, and I knew I'd found my Patient 0.  Most of the damage was closest to that cube, which by some dumb luck was smack-dab in the middle of the slab.

I've left the humidome off for the night, and I'm thinking of cycling some water through the cubes, using a turkey baster to draw it out from the bottom, maybe purge out any residual mold.

I also placed Patient 0 in my fire.   Did you know Rockwool is used as artificial coals in a gas fireplace?

If you owe back taxes, then you may ultimately become the dupe of one of the most potent creatures in their collection arsenal: IRS Tax lien services. As soon as those thirty days have passed the IRS will choose which approach to garnishment to make use of. The 3 typical techniques associated with levies are bank levies, wage levy, and physical asset seizure. What is a Tax Lien? A Federal Tax Lien is the federal government's legal claim against your property when you fail to pay a tax debt. When they place the lien in effect against you they can usurp your property, including your house, personal property, financial assets, essentially anything you have of value. IRS publications can really hang back one to the lowest degree of spirituality. An IRS tax lien is where the IRS files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien against taxpayers who have not been fully paid their taxes. The IRS will look to view any alternative equitable relief you could qualify for those who are not eligible for innocent spouse relief. And recognize that the larger your back tax debt legal responsibility, the sooner the IRS may issue this federal tax lien against your holding. Even if you possess the authority to signify yourself before the Internal Revenue Service, it is strongly recommended that you simply retain the services of a skilled tax professional. 
This tremendously boosts your opportunity associated with success. Lien exists after the IRS decides how much you owe, send you a become aware of how much you owe them and a demand for payment, and you abandon or refuse to pay the debt on time. The IRS files a public document to tell the public about your unsettled taxes, and these records will be available at the county recorder's office.  The putting is the IRS' attempt to collect back taxes from taxpayers by putting a lien on the assets of those taxpayers. The constitutional line that they file is public information and can be considered by credit reporting authority. IRS tax debt relief by enabling the debt ridden tax payer to reconcile the debts for a portion of the sum of money owed to the IRS. A tax lien is registered with the county government where the taxpayer resides. A tax lien comes into effect once the IRS evaluates your liability and informs you about the payment and you abandon to pay the amount of time. It is prudent to try out the advice of IRS tax specialists for IRS tax liens. The unenthusiastic impact can be far reaching, as noted above with the begging part. Keep in mind that an IRS lien release will typically occur ten years after the tax is assessed, provided the IRS does not sense once more. It actually is fairly challenging to set up your innocence of tax debt when the collection method has now started. The IRS is usually correct in these matters, but maybe it's possible that you are a rare one that slipped past them.

I'm a 32 y/o professional with a steady job.   I make $65,000 with $5-10,000 in bonuses yearly.  I just received my yearly bonus and was wondering the most efficient way to spend it.


I recently finished my 6 month fund with $12,000 in an FDIC insured savings account (interest rate 0.05%).  I have a 401k through my company worth $37,000 with Fidelity (T. Rowe Price Retirement 2045 Fund, Exp Ratio (Gross/Net) 0.78%). For the last 6 years I have been putting 10% of my gross income into my 401k, $250 per paycheck currently.  Honestly, I have not paid a great deal of attention in the past to my particular investment options.  My company matches 50% of my 401k contribution into ESOP stock of the company up to 6% (3% into the ESOP).  In the ESOP account I am fully vested at $100,000.


I have a 30 year mortgage of $145,000 that's valued by the county at $130,000, purchased in 2009 at 5.875% interest. I also have a car payment of $320 a month with 54 payments left at 0% interest.  Student loans are paid off and I don’t have any credit card debt.


Am I better off starting a Roth IRA with my bonus or should I just start smashing my mortgage to reduce the principal so I'm not under water?  My discretionary cash each month is about $300 after covering all my, honestly generous, living expenses. I want to put at least half that towards my mortgage, maybe more but I was considering starting a vacation fund.  I don’t mind staying here indefinitely, but I also don’t like being ‘stuck’ here should my situation change.


Also, I have been considering whether I should keep the whole of my 6 month fund in a traditional savings account or straight transfer it to my new Roth account (where if I need the money I can withdraw in an emergency) or some other type of account with a better interest rate and reasonable liquidity.

personalfinance,Should I start a Vanguard Target Retirement account now or wait?,"So, I haven't started retirement funding yet (outside 400 dollars I was forced to put towards a state retirement account as a summer employee at my undergraduate college) and I am 24 next month so I'm trying to get a jump on it. 

Looking at YNAB, I have enough money to move some things around and have the $1,000 minimum to start a Roth IRA with Vanguard and start building a retirement fund while maintaining my buffer and rainy day funds. 

That being said, I do still have federal student loans (which I am overpaying on and am on track to have them paid in 5/6 years instead of 10, highest interest rate is 5.75%) and my employer has a 403(b) I can start paying into in October and they match up to 10% of my income. 

Basically, am I better off 1)Starting the account 2)throwing it towards my  loans or 3)Saving to make the 10% match as soon as October hits (depending on how contributions are restricted, I should be sent more info once I qualify). 

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone! Looks like I'll be waiting on the Vanguard account until I get this 15k in debt off my back.",finance,1395340767

Thank you for contacting me and for sharing your  thoughts regarding the letter I recently wrote to federal regulators  expressing  my concerns about  Bitcoin . Hearing from West Virginians is very important to me, and I value the opportunity to hear your thoughts.
 
As you know,  Bitcoin is a  virtual currency that is  defined by a public address and a private key ; thus ,   Bitcoin is not only a token of value but also a method for transferring that value.  However,  Bitcoin   has gained notoriety in recent months due to its  wild price fluctuations and involvement in illegal transactions.  This virtual currency is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly unstable and  potentially  disruptive to our economy. 
 
Moreover,  Bitcoin is a haven for individuals  to anonymously purchase items such as drugs and weapons illegally.  As you may know,  I have already written to regulators once on the now-closed  Silkroad , which operated for years supplying drugs and other black mark et items to criminals   with the use of   Bitcoin . In addition, d ue to  Bitcoin's an onymous and irreversible transactions , the virtual market has been extremely susceptible to hackers and scam artists stealing millions from  Bitcoins users .   For example,  Bitcoin's anonymity has made the currency increasingly susceptible to cyber-thefts, including when  the currency's  maj or exchange, Mt.  Gox , lost over $500 million to hackers, and, as a result, had to file for bankruptcy. 
 
While many  foreign count rie s   have already  banned or restricted the use of  Bitcoin , the United States has yet to take any meaningful action. Thus,  I am most concerned that , as  Bitcoin is inevitably banned in other countries, Americans will be left holding the bag on a valueless currency.
 
Before the U.S. gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I  have  urge d the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.

personalfinance,Need some advice deciding whether to go forward with this student loan consolidation.,"I'm a recent grad as of last May and just started repayment on 4 private student loans last November. I wanted to possibly lower my monthly payments and interest rates by consolidating through a credit union, so I applied through CUstudentloans.org. I was accepted to consolidate 3 of my 4 loans through a 3rd party credit union.  I was just barely under the income limit to be approved to consolidate all 4 loans, so now I'm not sure if I want to go through with it. I'm not well-versed in financing so maybe someone could please offer some insight on this? More info is below.   

Private Loans:  
1-  $3428 @ 7.74% with $50.26 monthly payments  
2- $10581 @ 4.74% with $82.69 monthly payments  
3- $9868 @ 10.74% with $108.53 monthly payments  
4- $11514 @ 4.49% with 87.87 monthly payments  

Loans 2-4 were approved to be consolidated @ 5.64% over 15 years for a total of $32,225.   
I have the option of paying $265 for every month or doing a graduated plan of $151 for 48 months and then $328 for 132 months. My credit hovers between 730-740 so I was hoping to get a little better rate than 5.64%, but I guess that's the best I could get.  

Another redditor suggested rather than consolidate, work on paying extra for Loan #3 with the highest interest, and then working on Loan 1. I also have a monthly payment of ~$260 in federal loans, but that's another story in itself! I can afford my current payments, but I wouldn't be able to afford much more to work on paying off early.

personalfinance,Lots of help,"Hello all. I have a very unique situation. In fact im sure majority of your initial advice will be to discourage me. Please dont. I understand the risk. I want to do something special. Im willing to risk everything and live in poverty for the rest of my life. I believe with my work ethic I can succeed. So again please dont advise me to not to do it. Im lookimg for innovative advice on how to best do what I want. 

Ok so I feel like tl dr is coming so ill do my best. First im usually pretty good at everything I do. Every job ive ever had I learn quick and usually perform better. Not always the best but better than average.

I use to be a professional poker player. I was 18 got fired from a job. Had been living on my own since 15. Decided to move back home and play poker until I was a pro. Took me 6 months.

In poker I started a business. Not including my play. I was able to take 2000 and turn it into over 200k. With a daily return rate of around 20 to 30%. More in the end. I know this sounds crazy. My partner manages a very large mutual fund. He helped me a lot. He helped with numbers how much money to use. We had a llc. Legal contacts. 

Poker was made illegal about 3 years ago. Majority of my capital was seized. I invested nearly 80% of my profit and lived mostly still poor. Until I moved to vegas. Now when I say 200k that was not my profit. It was honestly prolly 30 to 40% in a little over a years time. Not bad for a drop out from the ""hood"".

Anyways I had a lot of things going on. Poker was stripped. I never really cared about the money. I just loved poker. I would play for hours sometimes 48 straight.  I just wanted to be the best. I didnt care about 2nd I wanted to be the best. I knew if I did that money would come. Now you may say I was addicted. No. I have played maybe 3 or 4 times in the last 3 years. I miss it and I still love it. But it takes a lot of money to have a proper roll for even the lowest stakes. And you cant make a ton of money at the lowest stakes, especially if its your livelyhood. Because your profit would barely pay the bills so you could never add to move up.

You could but would take years. And im an online player. Playing low stakes pisses me off. So I want to do something else to get me money for poker. I dont want to grind.

I have a friend credit score of 602 (creditkarma). 30k a year income. 6 years on the job. No money saved. A credit card with 800$ maxed out. Pay it every payday to reduce balance then max it out pretty much by the next payday.

Until today when he read a thread. He thought that would increase his score. Theres a car loan in his name. Purchased last year for 9.9k. A really high interest rate. Theres about 2k worth of medical bills in collections. 

The car is paid as agreed for a year and the credit card the same for 8 months.
He can within say a month pay 400 or 500 and budget down to aggressively build his credit.

So whats the best plan here? Next year he wants to buy a house. With one of the government programs for first time buyers. 

I have another friend who wants advice too. But ill start here. Ask any questions. But please advise on how to acclerate credit as fast as possible.",finance,1395359409

Bitcoin's promise: a financial revolution the web's been waiting for


&gt; A key moment, Sporny and others say, will be a meeting in Paris next week hosted by the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, one of the key bodies for setting internet standards.

&gt; Gathering for the first time to discuss web payment standards will be telecom operators such as Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica and AT&amp;T, payment companies including SWIFT, PayPal and Gemalto, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve.

&gt; Bitcoin can claim some credit for this buzz of activity.

&gt; ...

&gt; However, Visa Inc's head of innovation Jim McCarthy told an investors' conference this month that while there were things to be learned about bitcoin, ""I don't see those as the things that are going to tip the apple cart anytime soon.""

&gt; MasterCard and *Visa will not be at the Paris meeting*, noted Sporny.

personalfinance,Are we ready to buy a house? Details inside.,"My husband and I would really like to buy a house before the end of the summer. Is this goal reasonable given our current financial situation? A bit of back story: We moved to a new city about 7 months ago after he graduated from law school. We’re both employed in jobs we love, and anticipate living in this city for many, many years. We’d like to buy a house while prices and interest rates are still relatively reasonable, and would love to start trying for a baby at the end of this year. Our current apartment is affordable given our salaries. ($115,000 combined) This has allowed us to save up a decent amount, but it's way too small to start a family in.   

The houses we’re looking at cost around $300,000. We want to pay 20% down ($60,000) to avoid PMI. I’ve always been a “saver.” Spending half our cash on a down payment makes me freak out a little bit, but I know at some point we’ll need to pull the trigger and just do it.   

Here’s our current financial situation:   

**After-tax Income:**   
Me: $3,000/month  
Husband: $4,700/month  
**Total: $7,700/month**    

This does not include bonuses. We don’t count bonuses towards our budget- any extra money we get this year will go towards savings or investments. At the end of the year, my husband will start earning attorney bonuses on top of his base salary. This will be about $30,000 extra per year in the future.   

**Cash Assets:**   
Savings/Emergency Fund: $30,000  
Vanguard Mutual Funds: $30,000  
Other Stock Investments: $62,000  
**Total: $122,000**    

**Debt:**   
None. We have no student loans and we pay our credit cards every month.     

**Retirement Savings:**   
Vanguard Roth IRA: $4,000  
Vanguard Traditional IRA: $6,000  
**Total: $10,000**    

We just started saving for retirement this year. I know this needs to be higher. We’ll definitely max out our Roth IRA contributions this year, and I'll be eligible for my employer's 401k and stock options next February.  

**Current monthly expenses:**  
Rent: $900  
Utilities: $30  
Electric: $100  
Cell Phones: $180  
Car Insurance: $100  
Groceries: $450

Up to 2008, my credit scores were near the 800 range, but a divorce led me to an eventual short sale which dinged my credit score. I also had to ""short sale"" a vehicle I had at the time. The bank allowed me to sell the car for less than I owed them at the time.

This made my credit score drop to about 650 at the time, but throughout 2013, my average was back up to 720. I was planning to buy a house, got approved, etc. Everything was going well.

Back in January, I thought to myself that if I disputed the short sale (because the bank was fined in relation to my short sale) my credit score would increase and I could get an even better rate on a house I'm planning to buy in the future. A few weeks later, I got a letter back saying that nothing was changed so that was OK. I checked my score again and it was still in the 720 average. 

Today I got a letter from my credit card company saying that my interest rate would be hiked up by 5% because of my credit profile. I went to check my score today and boom. Equifax 694, Experian 693, but TransUnion had gone up to 727.

I am so upset right now. This is going to cost me a lot of money in interest rates with my potential new home purchase or even get me declined.

I make twice the amount of money I used to before. I am current on all accounts. I have done everything right after the short-sale. Why in hell would they lower my score? 

Could they have figured out somehow that I'm in the market for a home and want to screw me over and hand me off on a silver plate to the shark banks on purpose?

Any ideas on what I can do to ask for an explanation for the sudden drop or fix it?

How long does it take for them to update my score again?

personalfinance,Trying to figure out the best way to manage a 401(k) loan - input welcome and appreciated,"I'm 33 years old and have approximately $200K in my 401(k).  In 2011, I bought a house as a first time home owner.  To help finance it, I borrowed $30K from my 401(k).  Through my plan, I have a 15 year repayment plan at a super low interest rate (close to zero).  If I leave my job, I have to pay the entire thing back within 30 days, or else it is considered an early distribution.  They only withdraw $100 out of each of my bi-weekly paychecks to repay the loan.  I have called Fidelity to see if I could increase the payment, but I can't.  I can only get certified funds to make extra payments.  

I'm considering taking out a personal loan from a bank to pay back the 401(k) loan.  I *think* the calculus I should be thinking about is this: if I can make more in the market with growth and compounding/time value of money, than the increase in interest rate would be, I should do this.  And I think I would, right?  Because if I could repay it all today, this is money that could be growing for 30 more years.  I'm also hopeful that through a personal loan, I could do a five-year payment plan or something else that's both more flexible and aggressive so I can get this paid off.  

To further complicate things, I am considering leaving my job soon.  If worse comes to worse, I could just take it as an early distribution, but I really don't want to do that.  

Also, I have no idea how one gets a personal loan.  Do I do it as a home equity loan?  Or do they just look at my credit and figure out if I'm good for it?  An unsecured $25K loan seems like it might not be a thing that exists.  

Alternatively, am I missing any other options?  TIA, guys.",finance,1395406376

personalfinance,I did some simple student loan vs investment calculations to show how crippling student loans can be. Let me know if I made a mistake anywhere!,"Average Student Loan Debt as of December 2013: $29440

Average Student Loan Interest Rate: 6.8% (this includes federal and private lending rates)

To pay this loan off in 20 years, it will take you $224.42 per month which is quite a bit taken out of your check every month.

If you take that same $224.42 that you would otherwise pay into your student loan and invest it at 7% (which is pretty fair over 20 years) you'll end up with $118,130.66.

Simply, at the 20 year mark your student loans are at 0 but your portfolio is now at $118,130.66. This is where compound interest really starts to hurt/help you depending on what your situation was:

In another 20 years, which is an average of retirement age and around 65 after you graduate college, you're looking at a total of $575,259.08 for the person who took that $224.42 per month and paid into their retirement account for 40 years straight. The person with the student loan would still only be at  $118,130.66 (the original 20 year investment total). 

This is a difference of **$457,128.42**

This is obviously very simple math and either graduate could contribute more or less to their retirement. It does, however, show what a dramatic toll taking on debt can be. 

Edit: This was also showing people who take two different paths in life. I get that people try to pay off their student loans early but there are also others that do not. It's showing what a mistake you can make by deferring, paying the minimum payment  etc. I paid mine off early as well but I know quite a few people who won't come close to making the ten year pay off mark.",finance,1395409758

To that end, I continued to live with my parents, and socked away everything I had into investments - from the townhouse, from my paycheck, from my bonuses, everything.  I ran my old car into the ground, and then replaced it with a Prius for the low operating cost (a fine car which I still heartily recommend to anybody with a congested commute), which I've been running for the last 3 years.  I also didn't have any relationships in my 20s to spend money on, so that just got diverted into investments too.

At the end of last year, I hit my goal a year ahead of schedule - I now have enough money saved up from my investments to pay off my $270k mortgage in its entirety!  I live in Toronto, so I know that that's no small feat.  With the low interest rate environment, I plan to maintain the investments that I have, as the rate of return I get exceeds the mortgage's interest rate (3.6%) handily.  I make about $50k a year after taxes from my job, and collect about $16k a year on townhouse rental income.  Even after moving out and losing that rental income, I've drawn up a provisional budget that will give me an annual surplus of $10k, to be spent on vacations, further savings, and emergencies, which will also absorb the increased operating costs.

I have about $300k in equities, in addition to cash on hand (you can see how I've massively front loaded my savings in life!) - the plan is to allow $180k of that to grow in high risk investments to fund my retirement, as I have 35 years to absorb a lot of volatility (and my math suggests I'll reach my current retirement income goal of $50k/yr easily when combined with Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan), and use the other $100k as a renewable car fund (liquidating the last $20k as surplus to pay for this car with cash, along with selling my current one and using cash on hand and a sizable incoming tax refund to make up the rest), skimming off the top every 8-10 years and selling my incumbent car to get one of similar price, theoretically forever more assuming an annual 5% real return on investments.

In terms of major life expenses, I feel that I've already funded my retirement at 65, and as a single man, the townhouse is already all the house I feel I need for myself, and will even serve for the beginnings of a future family.  The only thing left is to renovate it and move in myself, but that's not until next year, and I have another full year to save up money from work and rental income to fund those renovations.  That's why I feel like I can upgrade to a luxurious driver's car, and enjoy the experience before I inevitably get into a relationship in my 30s, settle down, and have kids.  Heck, with a sedan, I can still keep that for the first few years of my hypothetical future kids' lives too, and the car will have depreciated enough by then that I shouldn't be too bothered about it.

So, with all that in mind, am I making a mistake by buying a brand new luxury car?  I can buy it with cash on hand by the time I take delivery in the middle of the year, and have a plan to afford comparable cars later too.  My math suggests I have the means to do this sustainably, but have I missed anything in my analysis?  I need to be 100% sure that I won't screw myself over financially by buying this car before I execute the plan, so I welcome feedback.",finance,1395428444

I wanted to throw out my personal situation, as I thought it may benefit anyone considering Lending Club or any other ""Social Lending"" company like Prosper.  

On Wednesday the 12th, I submitted a request for an 8k Loan through Lending Club.  I was pre approved for the 8.9% 3 year term, and after sending a bit of paperwork since then, was approved today.  

I overall found the people and the process quite affable, and would be happy to answer any questions.  


A bit about my financial status:
 
* Mid Sixties Income (Recently Promoted to Mid 80s)

* 8k Credit Card Debt Across two cards, 16 and 18% interest rates

* 16.5k Auto loan (3 years left)

* 2k Line of Credit Available


* Thought my credit was around 680's, ran it and got fico score was hitting 710.  Haven't had anything report against me in 3.5 years.  

I'm using the loan to pay of the CC debt in one fell swoop, then taking the additional payments I would make towards CC payments or just charging them up and paying them down to Build up a 3 Month emergency fund, then pay off the loan early, then extend the fund to 12 Months in the year after.

personalfinance,"21, looking to buy first house, and also need a smidge of tax advice.","First of, about me:

21, single.
Steady full time job for the past ~2 years.
$9/hour, gross pay before taxes for last year was 16,550. After taxes ~14,270.
I currently live in a house with two other room mates, one owns the house and the other is like me. I pay $400 a month.
I make a little extra money on the side by buying electronics, fixing and selling. Anywhere from and extra $100 a month, to 250.
Credit score is around 690. I have ~300 utilitization on a total of a 3,750 CL split between 3 cards. Always pay every month, never a late payment. Nothing derogatory on my credit report whatsoever.
No car payment.

The tax advice I need:
For 2012, I received approximately ~600 back on my tax return, this year I'm only supposed to be getting back 60 from federal and 20 from state. Nothing has changed for me from 2012-2013 that should effect my taxes. Same job, same house, same car, etc. Why is there such a difference? What am I doing wrong? I've tried filling out everything on turbotax, H&amp;R block online, and another, and they all say the same. I haven't actually gone into a tax preparers office, because I'm barely getting anything back, the cheapest I found costs $70 for them to do it for me. I don't know what to do about it.

Second part:

I'd really really like to purchase a house by June. I know its soon and will more then likely be extremely hard to do, but if possible I'd like some advice on what I can do to make it possible. 

My grandpa has ~30 rental properties in another state, and he will help me repair anything I would ask him to on a house that I purchase, but I will not ask him for help other then advice when it comes to actually purchasing the home. (He'd buy the house for me if I asked, but he gets taken advantage enough from others as is, and I love him too much to do that)

There are plently of houses in my area for 55k-95k that would suite me just fine. 

My girlfriend and our two best friends will be moving in with us. Girlfriend goes to school full time and works part time, she'll be contributing ~200 a month, and the other couple will be renting for ~500 a month. If you add those to what I spend now on just rent, it bring what I can spend total on a house to $1100 per month. On a pretty high estimate, I figure ~800 on the payment and utilities, leaving me with ~300 to put away for repairs/other various expenses that come with owning a home. 

That is very do-able for me. My main problem is the down payment, I don't really have anything to put down for it. I've been told by family members and friends there are various programs for helping with down payments, both federal and statewide (I live in Mississippi.) I just cannot seem to get in touch with the right people. Every person I contact turns out to be a dead end, and it's hard to find good programs that I would be eligible for.  

I also don't know what my chances of approval would be for a mortgage. 

Any help, advice or tricks would be **greatly** appreciated.

Thanks in advance.",finance,1395443130

personalfinance,options or suggestions for underwater rental in need of repairs,"First, a little back story. My wife and I purchased our first house back in 2004. We put no money down, got a 5 yr ARM with a 2.65 margin. So far our interest rate has been very low compared to a typical 30 yr. 
We tried to flip it, (one of the reasons we did no money down and a ARM) the flip flopped, so we stayed until 2011. The area was taking a turn for the worse and we couldn't pass up the house we are currently in.
We became unwilling landlords and we purchased a newer, bigger house closer to family so we can start a family.
Last year we started loosing money on the rental every month because of the escrow being short. Also, the basement started leaking. We tried one solution involving injecting a water proofing treatment from the outside costing us $7000. It recently started leaking again, now the water proofers need to trench the basement on the inside costing us an additional $4000. 
We can technically afford the additional cost but it would wipe our emergency fund out and we will be loosing more a month. We currently loose $30 a month on top of other repair expenses. We are also underwater, we owe $88k. A realtor friend ran numbers and best we could sell it for would be at $60k.

My thought would be to short sale it and use the $7k tax break from the business loss (first waterproofing) to offset the tax on the forgiven balance of the mortgage.

Would this work? 
Do you think this would qualify as a hardship for a short sale?

This morning I read a [story](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/rising-interest-rates-slow-down-housing-sales/2014/03/21/567817fc-b037-11e3-9627-c65021d6d572_story.html) in the Washington Post about rising home interest rates. It cited Fannie May experts predicting that home mortgage rates would rise to near 6% next fall.

I played around a bit with a [mortgage calculator](http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/) and it looks like the difference in a monthly payment on a $400,000 mortgage can be substantial. With some preset assumptions, here are different rates:

* 3% APR: $2,253/mo
* 4.5% APR: $2,593/mo
* 6% APR: $2,965/mo

Which means that a couple who could afford a $500,000 house at 3% APR is unlikely to afford the same house at 6% APR.

Step One: Order all of your debts by their total balances from the least to the most amounts owed. 

Step Two: Continue to maximize your savings on a monthly basis while paying only your debt’s minimum payments.

Step Three: Pay off the debt with the lowest total balance, regardless of the interest rate of the other cards, but only when you have saved an amount of money that is equal to or greater than the total remaining balance. 

Step Four: Once you pay off a debt, use the minimum payment that you were paying on this previous debt and apply it to your monthly savings. 

Step Five: Continue savings at your new savings rate and repeat the previous steps.

politics,"Reddit Exclusive Op-Ed: ""Questionable Authority"" (Read, Rate, Comment)","As tax season is now upon us, we shall reflect on how far our experiment can go in our Country that renewed itself on that day of fortitude – 9 July 1868. It’s that day of which the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S Constitution was ratified and has led this land anew to the following crucial principles that we shall cherish till death does us part: freedom and equality. As Sec. 1 states, ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."" It all seems based off recent events that we are living in a dire era that needs constant reminding of such principles, as well as the laws that enforce it. Beyond my years, there is a tradition claimed that we, as Americans, are a nation of laws and not of men. However, is such a statement truly an embodiment of what this land is and what its people stand for? As I have come of age, I have witnessed lawlessness to a dreadful degree amongst those who are three times my senior who claim to be our leaders. I’ve questioned the very merits of the ole’ principle of respecting one’s elders but I find it to be greatly unbearable to acknowledge such a principle on its own right. 

If such elders who hold power in this land begin to recognize the underlying principles of such an amendment then we shall conclusively proclaim that this is, in fact, a new world. It shall be a necessity for them to understand the causes behind it whilst connecting such causes to the present day. When they consider this, I shall without a doubt respect such elders as if they were my own. Nevertheless, until I see the entire respective body of this land’s political institutions tread boldly in enforcing it. It would be too tempting in never respecting their authority until the death of me. It has come to my attention that a particular statue in federal law has not caught the full attention of the legal community, nor the general public, of the legality of what is officially known as; ""federal insurance contributions.” It is an involuntary tax of 7.65% imposed on voluntarily employed individuals through their individual day-to-day paychecks, or wages, on a monthly basis. Moreover, such contributions are at the very mercy of one’s employer. Nevertheless, the employer is also at mercy, here... at the mercy of the federal government. 

If such employer does not comply, they are obligated to pay dreadfully large back taxes on each of their employees, including themselves, wages of the same percent withheld by their own employees’ wages. Is there any rational justification for this especially since, in theory, such taxes would eradicate one's business without creatively shifting resources overseas? With this in mind, if an employee acts on their non-compliance with such then wouldn't he or she submit to perpetual unemployment whilst being coerced to live on the government's dole? Is such a reach in governmental authority justified in the name of an ""insurance"" program that entitles one to funds for their retirement, but not guaranteed all of which one ""contributed?"" Unfortunately, this was the case in a Supreme Court ruling titled, ""Flemming vs. Nestor (1960),"" that reined in any meaningful purpose to the program. The Court has ruled that our contributions are not contributions but are mere taxes as dictated by Article 1, Sec. 8 of our Constitution. It leaves our government to use such contributions at-will for other purposes, reduce or eliminate benefits at any time like what might occur by the time I am in my forties -- in the 2030s, as the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Administration has warned in 2013. 

With this ruling set into place, there comes an accompanying ruling titled, ""Helvering vs. Davis (1937),"" which is concurrent with the one previously mentioned; in that, the Court justified the actions of the Congress in collecting and spending from such monetary sources on the basis for the ""general welfare."" I will let that one sink in with one question, what is general welfare? It begs unto the age-old question: does one’s employment through a binding contract solely sanction the result of the fruit of one’s labor -- money, a voluntary exchange? Is such fruit a result from the contract legally belonging to the employee for their own pursuit of Happiness? Does it bear truth that *italics*something voluntarily exchanged through legal means of ownership that is tangible, or moveable, considered one’s property as in private property? Surely, the mere notion of currency, as to wages, fits this description; therefore, logically speaking, this is the case because of the basis of voluntarily exchanged agreements. 

In Fleming vs. Nestor, the Court changed the course of history by declaring that Social Security payments -- monetary exchange, is not considered property, which wipes out centuries of the knowledge stating the contrary. With this, the Court ruled that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not secure our contributions, which is telling. As a means of highlighting the absurdity of this judgment, I shall not quote this clause in context, ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" As I recall, anybody who contributes to Social Security whether it be the employee or their employer... this is a clear violation because our contributions are paid to total strangers who have lived to see the Age of 65. Where is our ""just compensation"" for our savings in the present that we are entitled under the Fifth Amendment? 

Is it when we too reach such an age? If this is so, would we be getting all that we are entitled instead of being granted an amount peculiarly distributed to everybody, even if our neighbor has worked and contributed less? From this point, it begs the question as to whether such contributions forthrightly violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Whatever happen to, and I shall quote, ""nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"" that we seem to boldly apply to cases on social matters now and days in order to guarantee equal rights to the masses? Why do we purposely exclude such an amendment in applying to fiscal matters like this? Lastly, with this in mind, was there ever a contract that we have approved for our government to take such a measure in the first place, like non-apportionment, non-census, or non-enumeration taxes on income?",finance,1395503269

personalfinance,I have a question regarding canceling credit cards and the effect it will have on my credit score (USA),"For reference, I'm a twenty-four year old female in the US. 

I got my first credit card at sixteen and wracked up $550 in bills within the first six months. My mother found out, cancelled the card, and went apeshit. 

I waited until nineteen to get another card, and at that point, my relationship with my personal credit spiraled out of control. I charged up my cards to the limit and held them at the limit for several months. When my student loan refunds would come through, I would pay them off, only to charge them right back up again. 

In December of last year, my dad cosigned on a $5,000 to pay off my credit cards. By March of this year, I had paid the loan down halfway, but had also charged all of my credit cards back up. 

I woke up one morning and realized that I was paying $400 a month in loan/credit card payments and that something had to stop. I felt like a *literal* drug addict- taking out loans to consolidate credit card debt and then swearing I would never use them again, only to do it the next month. It was a cluster fuck. 

I now have paid off all of my credit cards and have a personal loan in the amount of $8,700. 

Here's the breakdown:
Dillard's card. Limit was $1300. Paid off, account closed. 
Target card. Limit was $700. Paid off, account open, card cut up. 
Discover card. Limit was $1,000. Paid off, account open, card cut up. 
JCPenney card. Limit was $900. Paid off, account open, card cut up. 
Wells Fargo card. Limit was $2,500. Paid off, account open, card cut up. 

Now that I've made myself look like a credit fiend, I want to explain also that while my credit card debt is ridiculous and utterly unnecessary, especially at my age, I was not ""drowning."" I haven't made a late payment in over four years. Creditors have never called me and harassed me. I have never had to choose between buying groceries and paying my credit card bills. I am not late on rent, electric bill, etc., etc. They were an issue, but I wasn't destitute. 

My problem now is this: everyone tells me that closing credit card accounts will hurt your credit. I have two closed accounts on my record already- the card from when I was sixteen and the Dillards card. 

These are the two options that I feel comfortable with: 1) close ALL the accounts and rely on savings and family if emergencies come up, to hell with the potential damage to my credit score, 2) close all cards but (either) the Discover or the Wells Fargo (depending on interest rates- I've had the Discover since 2009 so I figured I'd keep the oldest card?) and lower the limit to $200 in case my savings runs out or family can't help me. 

My worry with the second option is that I'll see that $200 and charge it right back up, then call the company and ask for a credit increase. I don't want to do that but I'm also worried about having an emergency that I can't pay for. I've only had my full time job since August, so piling up tons of money for savings hasn't been able to happen yet. It's a slow process.


So, /r/personalfinance, how will canceling ALL of my credit cards hurt my credit? Is it worth the damage to keep me from amassing credit card debt again? Will it hurt less to keep just one card open, or should I just go with my gut and cancel all of them? Thanks, everyone!

I'll refer to him as 'Professor Econ' or just 'Econ' below. I know that it would be a much stronger conversation if he had agreed to provide his name; but I have to respect his request for anonymity. When I'm confident of what Professor Econ said, I put it in quotes, the rest of the time I just paraphrase his statements. I may have some quotes wrong.

Peel: What are your general impressions of the idea of cryptocurrencies?

Econ: He is skceptical that it would have macro-economic implications. Money is a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.  The unstable price of Bitcoin does not make it a good unit of account or store of value. It is used now as a speculative commodity. If central banks do a real bad job, and if bitcoin or   some other medium of exchange proves itself better money, then  people will substiute out for that better medium.  He does not  think central banks are willing to substitute out.  He doesn't think  central banks will be so bad that some other form of money such as  bitcoin would ever have a chance to become significant.
  
Peel: I understand that you do not think Bitcoin will be successful; What would happen if it were to be successful?

Econ: Looking at back at history, international trade switch from the  British pound switched to the dollar in the 1930s, so it's possible  to have a change in the reserve currency. The main macroeconomic  implication would be loss of the 'exhorbitant priveledge' seniorage.  This would not be inconsequential but also not huge. For example if  the dollar was deposed, the US would pay a higher interest rate on  debt.  ""There would be greater market discipline of central banks. Problems would lead to shifts out of the dollar."" The same thing  would happen if another currency were to become dominant. In the  past there were worries about the yen and euro becoming dominant;  these currencies no longer are seen as a threat to the dollar.

Peel: How fast would such a thing happen if it were to do so?

Econ: It's difficult to predict the speed with such a thing would   happen. [Currently] the Fed can increase the growth rate of the  money supply without inflation. If people don't want to hold dollars, that would increase prices; fed would reduce the rate of  increase in money supply.   ""I'm sceptical that cryptocurrencies will account for a  significant proportion of transactions.  But I could be wrong! [laughs] If so, the Fed would need to respond. If Bitcoin were to become a competitor currency, the Fed would become more diligent and would improve the dollar's utility as money.  They would become more diligent in making the dollar a better unit of account and store of value.""

Econ: For some, cryptocurrencies are a substitute for gold.  It was not only monetary policy that led to shift from gold, but changes in the supply and demand.  Large swings in supply and demand can lead to changes in price in a commodity.  If the bitcoin market becomes liquid, the bitcoin price will change.  The Fed can destabilize [maybe he said 'stabilize'] prices by printing money, but bitcoin doesn't have that option.

Econ: ""What advantage does a cryptocurrency have over a stable dollar?"" 

Peel: Bitcoin is two things, a currency, and the decentralized,   cryptographically-secured network on which that currency is transferred. I understand that it costs 10-20% to make international money transfers from some African countries. Because anyone can use the Bitcoin network for free, it is relatively straightforward to set up an money transfer service that undercuts the established transfer services and does the transfer in minutes. It is possible to to make a bitcoin transfer for free.

Econ: Liked this example. If there is a switch to Bitcoin, it  would push banks to make transactions in the dollar more efficient. If traditional methods don't respond, then there would be significant movement. If banks start to lose money, they will respond with a PR war, and will lower the prices of dollar  transactions. ""Banks will fight dirty."" They will look to examples that show bitcoin as used only for illegal activities.

[We talked a bit about Ethereum after this, which he did not have an opinion on, and also his thought on what happened with the financial crisis, which led to the following:]

Econ: If the government says something is safe, then people will rely on the government, but if the governement doesn't do its job, then there are problems.  He suggested that it would be best if there was no regulation or good regulation.  He'd prefer they roll back regulation. The same principles would apply to regulation of  cryptocurrencies.

personalfinance,Seeking advice on opening an IRA for the tax break,"First, I'll lay out my current situation. I've just graduated college (though at age 28), I currently have $8,000 in the bank and $20,000 in loans, though I don't need to begin repayment until October. I'm currently making $2,500 a month working at a startup.

I've just been working out my taxes for last year through TurboTax and here's what I've come up with: between $7,200 of self-employment income I made at an internship over the summer and my grants and scholarships that were in excess of my tuition, my taxable income is about $15,000, leaving me owning about $1,500 to fed and between $0-500 to the state depending on whether or not I get a particular credit (they denied it initially for the last two years, but I successfully appealed once so it's spotty).

I'm thinking about dumping money into an IRA (I currently don't have any investment accounts) in order to reduce my taxable income. If I put in the max to a traditional IRA ($5,500), my tax owed drops to about $300, so a savings of $1,200+. It is my understanding that I can still do that until next month, but correct me if I am wrong.

The considerations are 

1) swapping my growing emergency fund for a retirement fund, though I think this is mostly a personal decision for me to make about how secure I feel with my income and the risk. 

2) Am I making the right decision in choosing a traditional IRA for the tax break now over a Roth IRA which could benefit me more in the future (I only know a bit about these things)?

3) Is this a crazy scheme and should I just pay the taxes and save my money, or put it towards something other than an IRA, or maybe not do the maximum contribution?

I think this would be an easier choice if it didn't involve the extreme of moving basically ALL of my money into an investment account so soon after entering the workforce. Any input and feedback is welcomed, thanks!",finance,1395529611
personalfinance,"What counts as ""earned income"" (for Roth IRA purposes)?","I hope this is the right sub... maybe this belongs in legal advice?  I'm having a heck of a time figuring out if my income for 2013 counts as ""earned income"" as far as being allowed to make Roth contributions is concerned.  I looked into it at the beginning of the year (in past years, I've made enough money from another regular W2 job that it wasn't an issue), and convinced myself I was ok to make Roth contributions this year and have been dutifully contributing every month so that I hit the $5500 max in Dec.  But now as Apr 15 draws near I'm looking into it again I'm suddenly much less sure.  I've tried googling and poking around on the IRS website, but I haven't found anything convincing in either direction.  

**I'm hoping you can help me figure out what's up or direct me to the right part of the tax code to read and figure it out.**

I am a graduate student paid by a fellowship (the official documents I have call it a ""training grant"" in some places and a ""fellowship"" in others.  The part that gets paid directly to me is called a ""student stipend"" in the documents) issued by a federal organization, but administered by my university (i.e. the fellowship organization gives my university a big chunk of money at the beginning of the year, and the university doles out a piece of it to me each month.  The university signs my paychecks.)  I do not get a 1099 or W2 or any other tax document listing the income, and there is no automatic withholding.  I don't think it gets automatically reported to the IRS, but it's definitely still taxable, and I pay quarterly estimated taxes and report it on my tax forms.  I have taxable income which is predicated on doing research which I would think counts as ""income from working"" on the one hand, but on the other hand it's not clear if I'm an employee or who my employer is (the university or the fellowship-granting agency or neither or both) or whether that even matters.  

1) **How do I figure out if this training grant/fellowship thing counts as earned income or not?**  At the beginning of the year I was thinking that since it's taxable it must count, but now I'm not so sure. 

2) **If it's not earned income, what do I do about the contributions I already made in 2013?** Do I just take $5500 out of my Roth now (before apr 15) and then I'm ok?  Or is it more complex than that?

3) **If I can't make IRA contributions with this job, is there some other tax-sheltered thing I can do with my retirement savings** for 2013 and the next few years until I have ""earned income"" again?  This fellowship is a multi-year thing.  I'm incredibly thankful for the funding, but it would still really stink to lose several years of being able to make Roth contributions.  I don't have access to a 401k through my employer.   I'm in my mid-20s and the thought of losing out on tax-sheltered retirement savings in such prime ""early career"" years is disappointing.

politics,"Reddit Exclusive Op-Ed: ""Questionable Authority"" (Concerning Constitutionality of Social Security)","As tax season is now upon us, we shall reflect on how far our experiment can go in our Country that renewed itself on that day of fortitude – 9 July 1868. It’s that day of which the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S Constitution was ratified and has led this land anew to the following crucial principles that we shall cherish till death does us part: freedom and equality. As Sec. 1 states, ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."" It all seems based off recent events that we are living in a dire era that needs constant reminding of such principles, as well as the laws that enforce it. Beyond my years, there is a tradition claimed that we, as Americans, are a nation of laws and not of men. However, is such a statement truly an embodiment of what this land is and what its people stand for? As I have come of age, I have witnessed lawlessness to a dreadful degree amongst those who are three times my senior who claim to be our leaders. I’ve questioned the very merits of the ole’ principle of respecting one’s elders but I find it to be greatly unbearable to acknowledge such a principle on its own right. 

If such elders who hold power in this land begin to recognize the underlying principles of such an amendment then we shall conclusively proclaim that this is, in fact, a new world. It shall be a necessity for them to understand the causes behind it whilst connecting such causes to the present day. When they consider this, I shall without a doubt respect such elders as if they were my own. Nevertheless, until I see the entire respective body of this land’s political institutions tread boldly in enforcing it. It would be too tempting in never respecting their authority until the death of me. It has come to my attention that a particular statue in federal law has not caught the full attention of the legal community, nor the general public, of the legality of what is officially known as; ""federal insurance contributions.” It is an involuntary tax of 7.65% imposed on voluntarily employed individuals through their individual day-to-day paychecks, or wages, on a monthly basis. Moreover, such contributions are at the very mercy of one’s employer. Nevertheless, the employer is also at mercy, here... at the mercy of the federal government. 

If such employer does not comply, they are obligated to pay dreadfully large back taxes on each of their employees, including themselves, wages of the same percent withheld by their own employees’ wages. Is there any rational justification for this especially since, in theory, such taxes would eradicate one's business without creatively shifting resources overseas? With this in mind, if an employee acts on their non-compliance with such then wouldn't he or she submit to perpetual unemployment whilst being coerced to live on the government's dole? Is such a reach in governmental authority justified in the name of an ""insurance"" program that entitles one to funds for their retirement, but not guaranteed all of which one ""contributed?"" Unfortunately, this was the case in a Supreme Court ruling titled, ""Flemming vs. Nestor (1960),"" that reined in any meaningful purpose to the program. The Court has ruled that our contributions are not contributions but are mere taxes as dictated by Article 1, Sec. 8 of our Constitution. It leaves our government to use such contributions at-will for other purposes, reduce or eliminate benefits at any time like what might occur by the time I am in my forties -- in the 2030s, as the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Administration has warned in 2013. 

With this ruling set into place, there comes an accompanying ruling titled, ""Helvering vs. Davis (1937),"" which is concurrent with the one previously mentioned; in that, the Court justified the actions of the Congress in collecting and spending from such monetary sources on the basis for the ""general welfare."" I will let that one sink in with one question, what is general welfare? It begs unto the age-old question: does one’s employment through a binding contract solely sanction the result of the fruit of one’s labor -- money, a voluntary exchange? Is such fruit a result from the contract legally belonging to the employee for their own pursuit of Happiness? Does it bear truth that something voluntarily exchanged through legal means of ownership that is tangible, or moveable, considered one’s property as in private property? Surely, the mere notion of currency, as to wages, fits this description; therefore, logically speaking, this is the case because of the basis of voluntarily exchanged agreements. 

In Fleming vs. Nestor, the Court changed the course of history by declaring that Social Security payments -- monetary exchange, is not considered property, which wipes out centuries of the knowledge stating the contrary. With this, the Court ruled that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not secure our contributions, which is telling. As a means of highlighting the absurdity of this judgment, I shall not quote this clause in context, ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" As I recall, anybody who contributes to Social Security whether it be the employee or their employer... this is a clear violation because our contributions are paid to total strangers who have lived to see the Age of 65. Where is our ""just compensation"" for our savings in the present that we are entitled under the Fifth Amendment? 

Is it when we too reach such an age? If this is so, would we be getting all that we are entitled instead of being granted an amount peculiarly distributed to everybody, even if our neighbor has worked and contributed less? From this point, it begs the question as to whether such contributions forthrightly violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Whatever happen to, and I shall quote, ""nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"" that we seem to boldly apply to cases on social matters now and days in order to guarantee equal rights to the masses? Why do we purposely exclude such an amendment in applying to fiscal matters like this? Lastly, with this in mind, was there ever a contract that we have approved for our government to take such a measure in the first place, like non-apportionment, non-census, or non-enumeration taxes on income?",finance,1395538793

Roth IRA 5500

Have 19,750 left to invest (27000- (1750+5500). Because my parents take care of my expenses.

So the grand question is where to allocate my funds if I plan on accumulating enough for a down deposit on a 400k house....sometime in the future (not sure when could be 5 or 10+ years)

I have been hearing two sides of the argument (colleagues and online). On one hand, I should take advantage of tax advantaged accounts....on another hand, I should mentally separate dipping into my retirement account unless I had to (so instead of money sitting in a bank, a personal brokerage account would be better).

How does a Roth 401k contribution work for tax season? So would I write off the next year that I earned a salary of 35k - 17.5k? or.... would it be 35k - (17.5 x 1.25; I use 1.25 because I lose about 25% of my gross pay through fed, state taxes, social security and medicaid). 


A)
Contribute $15,750 to my 401k (seeing as 17,500 is the max and I've already contributed 1,750 for 5% match)

Invest the excess $4000 in a personal account

or

B)
Don't invest in my 401k fund as company's funds are actively managed (even if they do well, probably equivalent to a total stock index minus the 1% for fees; Put--m), and PUT 19,750 in my personal broker's account that is currently invested in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2060 (the goal is to accumulate 30k so I can get Admiral status on US Stock, Int'l Stock, and US Bonds to mimic the target retirement fund - not sure if that's worth it, though. The Vanguard Target Retirement Fund is 0.18 expense ratio for no hassles)

I understand some will bring up an emergency fund but I don't perceive this to be an issue. I have ~7.5k in my bank with 2.5k of it in a Credit Line account (won't be touching).

First of all, the fund is composed (mainly) of Portuguese, Italian and Greek bonds at this point. As for it's performance history, it is in my opinion remarkable in terms of safety for the medium/long run, and lack of deep downward trends during crisis. 

Here's a picture for its performance [1994-today](http://i.imgur.com/vdNyrcT.png). This is ~6.85% annualised over a span of 20 years. To give a better idea of its evolution in [2001-2003](http://i.imgur.com/5GFvH70.png) the curve gives 5,08% annualised. And during the crisis of in only two years [2007-2008](http://i.imgur.com/nW9iRpf.png) this gives. Almost no dip and then shoots up. From [2010](http://i.imgur.com/8nGe4wE.png) until now it's about 13.40% annualized, shooting up to 30% in the last few months. 

Now I supposed this growth in the last years is mostly associated with a very low interest rate, as Euribor is super low, and recovery in the euro zone.

Now everything looks really good. But almost too good. Is there anything I should be wary of? If interest rates happen to go back up in the next years would this typically imply a slower growth? Or could it be really bad news? In other words, are there any signs I should be looking out for, that could indicate I should bail out asap at some point?",finance,1395594074

personalfinance,Should I Start a 5-year CD Ladder?,"(Throwaway account due to personal information.)

Stocks are relatively highly valued right now.  Bonds are poised for a drop as soon as interest rates rise, and when interest rates rise stocks will probably drop too, as money flows out of stocks and into bonds.  In this environment, I am a little scared that both stocks and bonds will underperform over the next couple years, and while I'm not taking money out of the market, I'm hesitant to invest more.

Basic question:   I'm thinking about throwing my extra cash into 5-year CDs (current interest rate is at 2.15% at GE Capital Retail Bank) to create a CD ladder we could break into if the market tanks.  My current asset allocation is 95% stocks, 5% bonds, and I'm thinking of slowly moving it to something like 85% stocks, 8% bonds, 7% CDs.

Background Information: I'm not sure how much background info is necessary, so I'll just write everything I can think of.  I (30M) and my wife (29F) have a net worth of $3.2MM almost entirely invested in index funds at Vanguard.  We have an emergency fund in liquid cash of about $30k, which is 6 months of living expenses for us.  We have no debt, no house, no car.  We rent an apartment in San Francisco and don't need a car.  I have an job making $165k/year, but I don't consider the job stable.  She doesn't work.  We hope to buy a house and have a couple kids within the next couple years. 

If I did do this, my plan would be to make the CDs in the 5-year ladder mature quarterly, and give enough cash that we could get by on them.  So, that means 20 CDs, one maturing every 3 months, with about $9k in each CD, for a total of $180,000 in CDs.  Is it stupid to leave this much money out of the market?

electronics,Help with basic CPU architectures?,"I made a basic CPU but now I want to make a more advanced one. 

I need some help, although it can excecute instructions and works as intended, the design is still pretty flawed. Here is a list of some of the more major open problems:

One feature I really want to integrate is a request acknoledge function. Mainly for input and output data, but also between the multiple ALU's(my previous CPU only has one ALU). How exactly would I go about doing this? My best thoughts now is something sorta like three state logic by enabling and disabling registers holding input data to an individual ALU.

What is the best way to feed data in? On my first CPU the data input method was pretty crude and cumbersome, it was basically disabling the CPU clock so registers could be loaded one at a time in response to an instruction comand.

Creating a matrix display driver? How would I go about making the characters display in a specific spot on a matrix display? I want an end result something like the ""Output"" command in Ti BASIC.

I still can't quite figure out how to coordinate the CPU cache. The method I use now is to use shift registers to convert the instruction into a serial stream and back into parralel to be stored into the cache where they can be asynchronously edited and reloaded.

The way I did conditional jumps is really ineficient, it involved storing the address to jump too aswell as all 16 bits of the condition on which to jump in the computers ROM. The Jump address was loaded to a register that was constantly fed to the ""data"" input of the program counter. The jump condition was loaded to a register. Each bit of the jump condition number was fed to the ""a"" input of a XNOR. The ""b"" input of these XNORS was loaded to the corresponding output of a register which was constantly loaded to the current data output. All of these xnors outputs are fed to a 16 input AND gate, whose output was fed the ""load"". The and gates output was also inverted and fed to the program counters ""count"" input.",technology,1395621794

personalfinance,"Inherited some money, unsure what to do with it.","Hello /r/personalfinance 

I am currently an 18 year old university student in the UK in first year studying software engineering, over the summer my uncle unfortunately died and has left me a sum of around £25k.

 I've never had more than £2k in my bank account and really have no clue what is the smart thing to do with it, ISA's have been suggested and it seems like there are some available to people my age which make some amount of sense interest rate wise, but other than that I have tried to look at what is available to me but I am a bit swamped.

He worked for British rail all his life and was a massive train-enthusiast, helped run a private steam train line in his spare time, so I was thinking I might take £2k out and go interrailing round Europe this summer and store the rest away for a rainy day/house deposit.

However I do have a job this summer which should give me about £4k to work with would it be better for me to use that money instead and have more of a lump sum to invest from the beginning?

I do not currently have a car and have not passed my test but I live in a big city and use primarily public transport and it is feasible to do so.

What is (in your opinion) the best plan of action?

personalfinance,Seeking advice for strategic repayment of multiple student loans at 6.8%,"I'm looking advice on how to best pay down my various studemt loans. I owe $58,210.10 at 6.8% interest rate across different loans. Here is the loan break down. 

Loan Number | Loan Type | Principal | Interest Rate | Minimum Payment
---------|---------|---------|---------|---------
1 | Stafford (Unsubsidized) | $12,953.75 | 6.8% | $93.02
2 | Stafford (Subsidized) | $7,563.72 | 6.8% | $54.59

6 | Direct Loan (Subsidized) | $7,102.79 | 6.8% | $98.17

The Stafford Loans are all on the 25-year repayment program. The Direct Loans are on the 10-year repayment program. 

I make $70,000.00 per year and almost have a $10,000 emergency fund saved up. 

In addition to the minimum payments listed above, I can probably throw about $1,000 per month at one loan. I'm a bit confused at which one this should be, here's why:

* Focusing on loan #6 would give me a quick win and free up $98.17 per month after it is paid off; however, it is a subsidized loan
* Focusing on loan #3 would take longer to pay off than loan #6; however, it would free up $148.22 per month and get rid of a big unsubsidized loan.

Now, I have $62k in student loan debt and want to buy a house in the upcoming 3-6 months. My middle credit score dropped from 712 to 694 in the last month, which will give me an interest rate that will cost me an extra $12,000 in the next 30 years of repayments.

Taking into consideration:

a. ~5.8% interest rate on the $62k debt

b. Getting an extra $480 and starting a retirement account (I'm 34 and have no retirement savings)

c. Putting the $3,776 may reduce my debt and therefore increase my credit score by a few points so I can a potentially reduced $12k savings in the life of my home loan.

personalfinance,I need advice on climbing out from under debt.,"Hello there.

To be clear, I have thumbed through the pages here and I am truly envious of you guys here. Those with your shit together and in proper order. It's hard to describe the type of envy I feel-- the best I can do is that it leaves a sinking feeling in my stomach if I dwell on it long enough.

I'm 26. I'm getting married to the love of my life in September, and we are finally moving in together in May. There's one hiccup.

I'm under about $1600 in credit card debt. I tried to pay it off within the 0% interest year but alas! I wasn't successful and so the uphill climb has begun. My fiancé knows I have a credit card but no idea how high the balance has soared.

I am in tears over that fact, but that's not the point here. The point is I need a plan to get it taken care of. I need to take action. So here is where I stand:

I make roughly $820 a month, or $410 every two weeks. My expenses total $320. My credit card has an 18.9% interest rate.

What are my options? How fucked am I currently? Would transferring the balance to another 0% interest card be the right move with the correct payment plan? And if so, whom should I look into for such a card?

I know I've made mistakes, so hopefully I can dissuade the criticism of my poor spending habits but I'm really just in need of guidance and (hopefully) someone telling me I'm not absolutely fucked.

personalfinance,"Help with paying my student loans off early, and avoiding excessive interest","Hi everyone,

I am looking for some advice to how to pay off my student loans early, and avoid paying the most interest. At this time, my student loans are broken up into private and federal loans. My private loans have an average interest rate of 2.5%, so I am currently paying the minimum on these loans. My federal loans have roughly the same total amount, but a much high interest loan.

They are broken down as such:

Loan A - $18,500 @ 7.65% fixed

Loan B - $8,300 @ 6.8% fixed

Loan C - $8,300 @ 6.8% fixed

Loan D - $12,700 @ 6.8% fixed


I am currently focusing all additional money per month on Loan A since it has the highest interest rate and the highest principal. The additional money goes towards the principal after satisfying the interest. At some point, the interest on Loan A will be smaller accrual amount than Loan D. 

I am looking for advice or a way to calculate when I should switch over from paying extra on Loan A to Loan D. Also  at what point when Loan D becomes low enough that I should switch back to paying Loan A.

personalfinance,Preemptive advice for my financial situation?,"Howdy PF. Today I was wondering if you could help me sort of dissipate the fog of uncertainty of my future today- financially at least. 

I fled home as soon as I graduated high school due to the enviroment. I moved 1600 miles away after carefully researching the college I wanted to attend, the job climate, weather, crime rate, etc. I settled on CCAD with a lovely scholarship and grants and such paid for two thirds. I saddled 5K debt (only because I had to live on campus) but now I am a sophomore this coming fall and my tuition will drop from the 30K it was for freshman year to 11K. grants and scholarships chunk off 9K (yay fafsa) That's my school situation.

Due to the fact that someone (evidence points to my ma) took out credit in my name when I was 8 years old and neglected to pay it, ""I"" have 2K of debt and a credit score of 378. Super awesome. I can't take out any loans. I don't mind taking longer for school, but I was given information that eventually, grants and scholarships run out usually under 5 years. So while I absolutely don't HAVE to finish school within 4 years, its highly encouraged. I'm currently part time due to the financial situation where I couldn't take out a loan. I live with a roommate roughly 30 minutes away from school on a bus ride.

I opted to stay out of school for the summer in an effort to try to find a more permanent living situation.

I have been desperately searching for a job for the past 6 months since I landed, but I hesitate following through with certain jobs due to the locale and the fact that I can't drive and doubly unsure of where I'll be living within the next 6 months. I have until June to a) find a roommate since mine is moving out or, b) move somewhere else. I lean towards option b so that maybe I could be within walking distance of school.

My father in an effort to help me sends me 400 a month. My mom deposits 25 dollars in my account every two weeks. On top of that, I work freelance and odd jobs in between filling applications and the like. I make roughly around an extra 100-400 a month on freelance alone. 

My expenses/bills/loose budget as of current
Rent: 307
Utilities: 100
Netflix: 8
Groceries: 80
Nescessities: 50

I don't have much to save afterwards and live ""paycheck"" to ""paycheck""

My pops still pays my phone until this november, to where it'll be up to me to obtain a new cell phone plan. Because of the fact most of my business is online and I rely on contact my commissioners asap and often, I cannot bend on not having internet capabilities on my phone. I don't call much and I text a lot. I've looked at Verizons unlimited plan for 70/month but I know there are cheaper options available. As for what, specifically, I don't know.

So, knowing all of that, these are my subsequent questions:
1) What should I do about credit? Because fighting the credit stuff needs a stable living situation, I don't know if I should start the process or not.

2) with that in mind, what do I do about school? I'm not opposed to taking a 'gap year' in an effort to smooth over my living situation and job situation to being much more permanent. I've discussed with my SO that if it were all to go well with us, we would move in together fall 2015. I would not be opposed to putting off school until then.

3) With 2 in consideration, would it be smart to instead move closer to school (were I able to continue to fall 2014 in education) or stay in my current living situation near many job locations and instead procure a new roommate?

4) How does one make a budget when their income is fuzzy after a certain extent? Should I cut it into percentages?

5) I do not have a savings account. I just having a checking account with navy federal and a debit card with them. I have a paypal debit card linked to that, but that's not really a bank but I have no other choice. Should I go through a new bank for a savings account/credit card for use in emergencies/building up credit?

6) I don't have a lot by choice. I like to keep it light. I have a 3ds I bought when things were better, a macbook for school, a tablet (wacom) for school, and a busted gs3. I've sold everything else. I sleep on a mattress on the floor and I have no concrete furniture except a dilapitated floral couch and a couple beanbags. I don't feel the need to get any more furniture except perhaps an actual mattress instead of the cot thing I'm currently sleeping on. Is it okay to not bother getting a frame or is that something I need? I figured I could just use like, pallets or something.

7) 
I already use Mint. I have a savings account my parents have access to (at least to deposit bones). I have a paypal debit card that allows me to track my purchases via emailed receipts. No credit card. I browse r/selfsufficient, r/frugal, and r/personalfinance. It is not possible to live with either one of my parents, family is far away/dead, and art degree is non negotiable. Cannot join militiary due to health reasons. I learn website building and computer languages in spare time in order to get a leg up. Um. I've picked my brain for anything else that may be pertinent to help, so please, if you know of resources or can impart the kind of advice you'd get from your pa, please do help.

Bitcoin Swaps Near Reality as Tera Group Forms Legal Framework

By Matthew Leising and Silla Brush

March 24 (Bloomberg) -- Tera Group Inc. created a legal
framework for Bitcoin swaps, which would let investors trade
payments based on how the virtual currency performs against a
real one.

The terms for a multimillion dollar swap between two U.S.
institutions is planned to hedge Bitcoin volatility over a 25-
day period, the Summit, New Jersey-based company said in a
statement today. Swaps based on Bitcoin are unregulated and the
firm is seeking the blessing of the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission so it can offer the trades on its regulated
swap-execution facility, the company said.

“We as a company are trying to bring some structure and
some protocol to help the Bitcoin community,” Leonard Nuara,
the president of Tera, said during a phone interview today. “It
provides a tool for a natural hedge to get relief from the price
changes in Bitcoin.”

The regulation of Bitcoin, let alone derivatives linked to
it, is an unresolved question in many parts of the world. Even
as regulators and investors struggle to grasp Bitcoin’s many
uses -- including investment vehicle, payment-processing system
and money-laundering tool -- they are now confronted with the
additional complexities of an emerging derivatives market.

The International Swaps &amp; Derivatives Association created
the master legal document for swap transactions in the 1980s,
and it’s still in use today for customized trades that can’t be
backed by clearinghouses. Tera would join others in the quest to
create derivatives based on Bitcoin.

George Samman, a former Wall Street investment adviser who
in May helped start a platform for betting on Bitcoin’s price
swings, saw trading on his BTC.sx website grow to more than $35
million by Jan. 21. After the shutdown at Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based
exchange for buying and selling Bitcoins, BTC.sx suspended
trading because it had to find another exchange partner for its
customers.

At the CFTC, the top U.S. derivatives regulator, lawyers
are considering if and how to oversee derivatives linked to
Bitcoin and other digital currencies, two people briefed on its
work said in February. The agency has been preparing an internal
memo that examines the CFTC’s authority over digital currencies
and how it might exercise those powers to regulate the markets,
the people said.

Tera has provided information about its Bitcoin agreement
to the CFTC and is in discussions with the regulatory agency,
Nuara said in the phone interview. Tera hasn’t asked the CFTC to
decide on approval by a certain date, he said.

“The infrastructure and regulatory protocols already exist
in the conventional OTC swaps markets to support these hedging
instruments,” Nuara said in a statement today. “Regulatory
approval is crucial to the long-term growth of the market
utilizing Bitcoin.”",cryptocurrency,1395680906

business,"If The IRS Calls, Hang Up","Bp Holdings Tax Services promoting profit - The largest ever phone fraud scam of [Internal Revenue Service ](http://www.bpholdingsmngt.de/) impersonators is underway this tax season, and thousands of victims have lost more than $1 million as a result of the scam, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Taxpayer Administration. TIGTA, which has received reports of over 20,000 of the fake IRS calls, is warning taxpayers to be on the alert.


The IRS first warned taxpayers of the pervasive phone scams in November and included them on its Dirty Dozen tax scam list for 2014. The scammers appeared to first target to recent immigrants, but the scam has spread to the general population, and has hit nearly every state.


The scammers make unsolicited calls to taxpayers claiming to be IRS officials. Then the scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license. Real IRS representatives will not make such threats, nor will they ask for debit card, money order, or bank account information over the phone.


The problem is the calls feel “real.” TIGTA says the scammers typically use common names, know the last four digits of the victim’s Social Security number, make caller ID information appear as if the IRS is actually calling, send bogus IRS e-mails to support the scam, and sometimes call a second time claiming to be the police or department of motor vehicles, and caller ID again supports their claim.


TIGTA is asking taxpayers who don’t owe federal taxes who get a call like this to call and report the incident to their integrity hotline at 1-800-366-4484. If you do owe federal taxes and get a call like this, TIGTA says to hang up and call the IRS at its official number, 1-800-829-1040 (that’s 1040 like the form number for your federal tax return).

Forex,AUD/NZD (or NZD/AUD for you locals :P) discussion,"Looking for a bit of discussion on this pair.  

This pair is driven heavily by interest rate differentials, a good correlation exists between the 2y swap spread or the 1y1y spread between AU and NZ.

RBNZ has a fairly steep interest rate track priced in, with 4% expected (possibly another 25bp hike) by end of 2015.  

RBA is moving back towards a more neutral bias going forward, however there are obviously risks regarding raw material prices moving lower (iron ore is a big one), and Chinese slow down concerns.  

Market positions seems to be fairly stretched, albeit it has been twice what it is now late last year and earlier this year (probably as hedge funds shorted Aussie in response to the RBA cutting cycle and China).  This is based of CFTC currency futures positioning, so it's not a perfect method by any stretch.

This is obviously a longer term trade, with ideal entry back towards 1.0550 rather than the 1.07ish level we're trading at now.  

Would be interested to hear any constructive thoughts on this pair ... not really interested in what you think it'll do in the next 24 hours, more thinking a 1m+ view.",finance,1395709539
Banking,(teen advice) Having a dedicated savings account VS Managing all finances with a single debit card account,"19 year old living with roomates in Alexandria, VA.

Liberty Reserve was a Costa Rica-based centralized digital currency service that billed itself as the ""oldest, safest and most popular payment processor ... serving millions all around a world"".[1] The site had over one million users when it was shut down by the United States government.

Also, please excuse me my bad english (polish is my native language), however I will use it to the best of my abilities. I have also read the FAQ and most of the topics that seem to be related to my situation. 

Anyway, being 25yo I have realized that I do not have (never had) any financial plan. As the title says I believe that's better to start now than never, but I just want to make sure that I understood FAQ correctly. Also, I would like to ask you guys/girls for your opinion on certain subjects.

So here we go:

Age:25yo
Status:single
Financial situation:
*stable job (E5 US Navy) - $4k/mo; $16481.11/yr according to W2 (only base pay is taxable/no state taxes being paid)
*$5000 in savings
*no emergency fund
*just paid off my car loan
*$0 debt (except $2300 on credit card - will be paid by the end of the mth [most of the expenses go through 1% cashback credit card)
*member of Navy Fed Credit Union (if that makes any difference)
*storage unit $100/mo and car insurance ($100/mo - full coverage, progressive) is my only expense so far

Once I get home (from deployment) pay changes to ~$3700/mo. Then additional bills get in effect:
*apartment - $950+utilities
*cell (does anybody from here or r/Frugal know decent plan with decent coverage in Virginia area?)
*car utilization bills - oil changes (due to warranty it needs to be done by dealership), gas, tires etc
*media (probably FIOS 50/25), quite sure that I'm going to skip cable (any good alternatives to cable?!)

Also I've meet a girl/girlfriend (E2 US Navy). However she's carrying roughly about $8000+ in various debts (credit card, student loans). She also has no car and quite bad driving record. 

My plan is to pay off her (now ours) maxed out credit card (10%APR) since that's our biggest expense. I plan to do that even before we build our emergency fund (both of our jobs are pretty stable, and this interest rate on this maxed out credit card is hurting our budget and her credit). Than pay off student loan (that would be one, maybe 2 paychecks evolution), and then start from scratch building our financial stability (emergency fund). Also after or in conjunction with emergency fund we plan apply for the car loan on my name (since difference in our credit scores is about 300pt) we also plan adding her to my insurance (it will be cheaper than her trying to get insurance alone). 

Does anybody see, know better solution (maybe refinance all loans into one loan with lower APR?)

One more question to the military savy folks. About TSP, should I use traditional or Roth contributions? Also since we're young we planned on following I (international) and C (similar to S&amp;P500) funds (any advice on that?). And since military is not matching up contributions should we invest in something different (like Vanguard low-cost index fund), or stick to TSP since it's very low-cost option? Or maybe use Vanguard but when a chance max out tax-free contributions to TSP (while being deployed in combat zone)?

Please excuse me if I'm asking silly/moronic questions but I would rather sound like an idiot than be an idiot by not asking.

Please let me know if there is any additional information needed to asses my situation, also let me know if I missed something important (which I probably did).

Why I Believe In Bitcoin - And How I'm Investing In It
Mar. 25, 2014 10:46 AM ET  |  1 comment |  Includes: BTCS, OSTK, SMME

Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize payment mechanisms.

Bitcoin is also a way to hedge against inflation and currency debasement.
Here are some ideas to buy the Bitcoin story through an online trading account.
As someone who loves exploring the latest startup and technology trends, I've been keenly following the latest on Bitcoin startups that get funded. I must admit I still cannot entirely wrap my head around bitcoin. For example, is Bitcoin a giant bubble or not? Is it a real currency or more a commodity? What is indisputable though is that the Bitcoin phenomenon is very real, and there is a whole startup ecosystem forming around Bitcoin. Indeed, what I didn't realize until just now was how serious VCs are about Bitcoin - there is some serious money from major VCs going into bitcoin startups, as this chart from technology site Techcrunch demonstrates:

(click to enlarge)
Recent VC Investments in Bitcoin Startups

At this point in my thought process, I have genuinely come to believe that Bitcoin genuinely has potential to become the ""gold of the Internet."" To further understand the potential of Bitcoin, legendary VC Mark Andreessen - whose firm Andreessen Horowitz recently invested $25 million in bitcoin startup Coinbase - explained it recently in a piece he wrote in Dealbook. Says Andreessen:

""Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.

""Bitcoin is the first Internet wide payment system where transactions either happen with no fees or very low fees (down to fractions of pennies). Existing payment systems charge fees of about 2 to 3 percent - and that's in the developed world. In lots of other places, there either are no modern payment systems or the rates are significantly higher (Andreessen mentions rates of up to 10% for international remittances).""

Andreessen concludes this fascinating piece by noting that ""Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals and businesses alike.""

With over $50 million of his own money invested in Bitcoin startups, as well as a track record of predicting and shaping the most innovative technologies to come out of Silicon Valley, Andreessen is a voice well worth listening to.

One thing that Andreessen does not go into much in his article - since he is not an economist - is how Bitcoin could make an excellent hedge against further currency debasement. Consider the ongoing implementation of QE, which has dramatically expanded the US monetary base, or M2. The US Monetary Base is at a current level of $3.869 Trillion, up from $3.734 Trillion last month and up from $2.874 Trillion one year ago. This is a change of 3.64% from last month and 34.62% from one year ago. The chart below from the St. Louis helps us visualize the massive amount of new money that has been - continues to be - created by the FED:

(click to enlarge)
The Current Monetary Base Via St. Louis Fed

In my opinion, at some point this massive increase in the monetary base will end up feeding into the real economy. Of course, we cannot predict when this might happen with any certainty, but it certainly makes sense to have some kind of inflation hedge in your portfolio. A major inflation hedge that many investors have long used is gold, there is an argument for having a small portion of your portfolio's inflation hedge outside of gold, and with the increasing development and legitimacy of Bitcoin it might be the time for investors to begin to explore the new internet currency as an option. One excellent reason for doing so is that the original creator of Bitcoin - who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto - developed an algorithm that set a finite limit on the number of Bitcoins that will ever exist: 21 million. That means that no government or central bank can ever rev up the printing presses to create more bitcoin, the way the FED has done - and continues to do - with the US dollar.

So if you believe in Bitcoin, like I do, the next question is how can we invest in the bitcoin story from an online brokerage account? This is still not the easiest thing to do, but based on some research these are some intriguing options to consider:

Bitcoin Shop Inc, (OTCQB:BTCS) Bitcoin Shop is a pure play on the increasing use of bitcoin as an ecommerce system. BTCS - which was previously known as TouchIT Technologies Inc - is offers approximately 140,000 goods through an affiliation with Amazon. One reason BTCS intrigues me is because it is a way to invest in the Bitcoin story without the high volatility of owning Bitcoin directly. As an analogy, think of BTCS as you might think of the stocks of exchanges such as CME - the value of the investments trading on CME might fluctuate, but CME takes a tiny cut of every trade made. I believe that whatever fluctuations Bitcoin may have that it will continue to be increasingly accepted in the ecommerce world, and BTCS should be a beneficiary of this.

Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK) OSTK is another ecommerce play on Bitcoin, albeit not a pure play like BTCS. OSTK recently started accepting Bitcoin as a payment mechanism and within 24 hours it had processed $130,000 worth of sales in bitcoin.

SmartMetric Inc (OTCQB:SMME) SMME is a developer of patented payment card technologies and in-card biometric products. The company just announced the creation of its SmartMetric Intelligent Card OS, which it describes as ""an operating system that runs on nano-computers built into its patented SmartMetric Biometric Bitcoin Card. The card is the first biometric, fingerprint protected Bitcoin payment card in the world.""

Finally, as a side note, the Winkelvoss twins of Facebook (FB) fame recently announced plans to launch a Bitcoin ETF which will track the price of Bitcoin, in the same way that an ETF such as GLD tracks the price of gold. This Bitcoin ETF though has not yet been approved by the SEC and consequently has not started trading, so it is not currently an investment option.

I personally prefer not to speculate on the price of Bitcoin directly, and hence BITCN is not one I'd ever opt for. I would rather look at stocks that are a play on the overall Bitcoin story itself, and if I had to pick just one of the options described above, it would be BTCS. Needless to say, any of these stocks are extraordinarily risky, and indeed, I'd compare investing in something like BTCS as akin to investing in an early, pre-exploration stage miner - although the risk is extremely high, the payoff could be astronomical if the stock takes off. However, it goes without saying that these are not specific recommendations, but only ideas for anyone interested in exploring how to invest in the bitcoin story through an online trading account to explore further.

personalfinance,We need two cars this week. Can anybody offer up advice here?,"My 2001 Lincoln broke down a few weeks ago at almost 200k miles. We have been pouring money into repairs lately on it, and it's time to move onward and get a more reliable car for me.

Husband totaled his car two weeks ago. It was an 05 Toyota Corolla with 150k miles on it. We had full coverage and have a check for 7k to spend on another car from insurance.

My questions are:

For my husband's car, he needs a really reliable car that will take him 120 miles a day (round trip) for work. It has to have great gas mileage, and be a fairly easy and inexpensive car to fix up should problems arise (which is why the Corolla was so great). Would it be okay to attempt a straight across sale? Meaning, should we get a car in good condition with good mpg for $7k, even if that means a car with 100k+ miles on it (considering his was at 150k)?

With this in mind, I also need a car for around town. We won't put nearly as many miles on mine, so I was thinking we could use our home equity credit line at a really low interest rate to buy myself a car (about 13k). We do not have cash for this one, but I'm sick of having old beat up cars that cost more in repairs than the car is worth. I also think it would be good to have a newer car in case my husband's breaks down and he needs a reliable one to get to work for a bit.

Does this sound right to you guys? I'm getting mixed advice from getting my husband a newer car (about $20K) and me nothing (which I could technically do, but it would suck) to splitting it up so he has a $10k car and I have a $10k car. But I don't want them to crap out at the same time, so this seems like a silly idea.

Any advice or thoughts on the best way to handle this would seriously make my day. Thanks so much!",finance,1395761605

Fast forward 4 years, I got a secured credit card to rebuild my credit. It's really not doing anything for me. It's a $400 limit and I use it to pay for food and things of that nature and pay it off in full everytime. I've had it for almost two years now and I've called Capital One explaining the situation and that my income has drastically changed. I went from $27 an hour to $53 an hour (IT - App Developer). So, I'm pulling 100k. They won't extend my credit line because it's a secured card and I need to apply for an unsecured card.

I already know I'll be rejected because of the credit score and I don't want a card with a high interest rate anyway.

The negative default on that loan will go away once it's paid in full in the next 3 months. It's at $3000 (was $10000 after interests and fees from defaulting). I'm contributing $1200 a month for all of my loans since I started my new job.

In all, what should I do? I'm paying all of my loans and I should be debt free by the end of this year.

personalfinance,Is it possible to remove a cosigner from Sallie Mae student loan or will we have to pay it off?,"Hi, Using a throwaway account due to the personal info in here.

My wife and I are in USA on an H1B Visa currently, both of us in our early 30s making approximately $80 to 100k each. My wife had taken out a couple of Sallie Mae loans in 2008 for her postgrad degree which were quite large (especially given the financially conservative nature of the culture from which we come), due to it being an Ivy League. She had used 2 of her family friends for these loans as cosigners.

Now, one of the cosigners wants to be removed asap from one of the loans for some personal credit reasons. My wife spoke to Sallie Mae on the phone about this and from what she told me they said it might not be possible. 

From my research of the past couple of hours it seems like it is quite possible if she has a good credit score and has had 24 consecutive on time payments on her account. She has never been late in the last 5 years on either one of the loans and we both have a credit score wavering 700 to 750 last I checked.

Following are the details of the 2 loans currently (rounded off). They're both under the type ""Business Education Loan"" and since we aren't Americans, these are private loans.

1. 	Principal balance:	 $45,000.00 (Started at about 60k)

 	Interest rate:	1.75%	 

 	Interest rate type:	Variable	Unsubsidized	 

2. 	Principal balance:	 $30,000.00	 (Started at about 40k. This is the cosigner who needs to be removed)

 	Interest rate:	2.0%	 

 	Interest rate type:	Variable	 Unsubsidized	

My questions: 

1. What is r/personalfinace's thoughts on these interest rates? I'm asking because if these are really good, we will put in that much more effort to make sure we can have the cosigner removed without changing the loan terms. From what little research I have done till now, it seems they're quite good, but it might be selection bias as most people giving examples of their rates on forums may have higher interest rates (and hence they ask questions on what to do with them.)

2. How likely is it that we may have this cosigner removed and what are the steps we should take for this? Sallie Mae might be denying this removal because we are not US citizens or maybe because my wife might not be asking the right questions (she can be a little iffy when it comes to any personalfinance matters). 

3. I'm currently away on a client site for a few months - would it be possible for me to talk to Sallie Mae directly about this matter if I have all the details or perhaps on a conference call with her or would they only speak about it to her?

4. Any other advice that you can come up with, even if unsolicited, given my details and my general ignorance of US' financial and tax world.

Sorry for all the rookie questions and if I've provided too much detail or omitted any necessary data (please let me know and I'll provide it). I'm trying to get a crash course in personalfinance from now on as I realise how important it is - especially for someone living and earning in the US. Thanks.",finance,1395779658

personalfinance,Is it worth it pulling from a retirement account early in order to pay student loans?,"I have ~$30k in student loans with an average ~6.5% interest rate.

I also am forced to contribute to a mandatory before-tax contribution plan in which I currently have about $5k.

Apparently I can take out that retirement money if I were to ever leave my current position (but obviously pay taxes and some early withdrawal penalties). 

Hypothetically speaking, would it make sense to take out that money, pay any taxes and penalties, and pay off student loans?

personalfinance,Suggestions Please: What To Do With 20K Post Tax,"Hi r/PF,

Longtime lurker.  I wanted to see if I could get some thoughts and opinions on what I should do.

First, I'm a 34/m.  Single, but about to get married.  No kids.

I currently have a High Yield Savings Account that I use for an Emergency Fund.  After reading r/PF, I'm thinking the amount I have in there is excessive for my normal 6-8months EF.  I think I could probably take about 20-30k out of my EF and still be ok to cover 6-8months of expenses/bills/etc without issue.

I contribute to my company's 401k and get the full matching. (This is pre-tax, so doesn't really apply here).
I have a Roth IRA. Maxed it out for 2013 and 2014, so can't contribute anymore.

So with that in mind, what should I do with the 20-30k that I take out?  Is there some sort of ""tax advantage"" account I can open and put this money towards to earn interest/income?  My end goal to try to get the money to earn for me, but it doesn't necessarily have to if there are better uses.

Some thoughts I've had:

1) I have a mortgage, which is my only debt and I'm current on, but I could dump it in there to bring the principle down.  Currently 154K left @ 4.75%

2) I thought about buying Series I Government Bonds, but that's only 10K per year.

3) Put in a CD that might have a high interest rate, but rates aren't the greatest right now

4) Open a brokage account and invest in some Mutual or Index Funds

Again, I'm just tossing around ideas and not sure what to do with these post-tax dollars that will give me the best bang for the buck.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thank you.",finance,1395792141

Bitcoin,I filed my US federal taxes and claimed a $76 capital loss on Bitcoins. Calculation based on (nearly) perfectly balanced book of 107 transactions where 46 realized a loss/gain. AMA,"Some basic info. I spent about 15 hours total working it all out (would take way less time next year, lots of time lost figuring out how to do stuff).

I used http://ledger-cli.org/ and input ALL transactions from all wallets, and exchanges (107 in total) where 46 of those was a situation where I disposed of Bitcoin resulting in a loss or gain.

I then looked at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdf to figure out what information would be required and sent a spreadsheet to my bookkeeper containing all the relevant information on those 46 transactions. 

Turns out the IRS doesn't care about transactions less than $0.50 so 12 of those transactions weren't reported on the tax return, but all 107 Bitcoin transactions were instrumental in balancing my Bitcoin books and tracking lots of Bitcoin in a FIFO manner. I could have tried to sell specific lots out of order, but I erred on the side of considering them all combined because I moved stuff between wallets/exchanges so much that if IRS came calling I couldn't actually justify the separation.

If there is interest I might write up a tutorial on how to track Bitcoin with Ledger, 10 of those 15 hours were probably spent just figuring out how to make all the transactions balance in such a way that allowed me to make Ledger do the capital gains calculations itself.",cryptocurrency,1395795420

personalfinance,Taking that next financial step (26 yr old),"Hi personal finance, I need some help. I'm 26 and am starting to really get established and get my feet under me. I am always concerned that I am not doing what I need to do and that everyone else is much further ahead. I have a good job, completely financially independent and am ready for the next step for a better future. I am far from a finance guru but I've managed what little money I have pretty decently so far and now I'm ready to know more. So gimme what you got as far as advice/opinions/thrashings. Finances are as follows:




What I currently have:

$16,000 in the bank spread out over a checking and savings. Savings account has about a %.89 interest rate.

$10,000 in a 401k. This is through my old company which uses a different institution than my new company's 401k (will need advice on what to do with it)




Income:

~$3700/month take home or with a chance at a yearly bonus (something I never count on). I just started a new job and can't enroll in 401k so this take home pay will reduce a little once I can even though the money will still be 'mine'.




Fixed Outgoing:

$6,500 left in student loans. Have been paying aggressively since I hate any kind of debt. This is currently at about $290/month

$550/month rent payment

$250/month car payment

$100/month car insurance payment

$100/month electric (have roommates, hard to lower this)

$80/month phone payment

$50/month water/gas payment




Variable Outgoing:

~$150-200/month groceries

~$80-100/month gas for car

~$100-200/month for entertainment (restaurants, bars, concerts etc...)




I might be forgetting something but that is the general gist of my monthly income and expenses. I don't spend recklessly on 'things' although I will spend sometimes on 'experiences' from time to time. I have 2 credit cards that I use day to day but both get paid in full each month and rarely will have an outstanding balance at the end of the month. They have different due dates so one of them always has a balance but their respective balances never go more than a month or two without being paid in full. One has a limit of $7500 (Capital One Venture Card) and the other has a limit of $5,000 (Chase Freedom). My credit score, last pulled in February of this year was just over 800 for two of them and the third was in the 700s (can't find the paper right now).


I can't think of anything else to disclose at the moment. So, how can you help me manipulate and maneuver my monies to where they need me to be so I can save as much as possible for years to come. Can't wait to hear what you got for me. Thanks :-)",finance,1395799158

dogecoin,We need to stop funding &amp; donating and start spending.,"With this NASCAR thing being fully funded AND doge4water also being completed recently a lot of DOGE are going to USD. NASCAR nor any place the water foundation wanted to spend money take DOGE.

What happened to those tens of thousands of DOGE that got 'donated'? They got traded to an exchange to BTC and then to USD. You just flooded the market with a ton of DOGE in a firesale because someone needed USD.

2 of the biggest campaigns so far have just been funded and doge is in freefall and on its way to bottoming out at the lowest ever.
-

We need to be buying stuff from food vendors. Selling things on craigslist. Exchanging your money for DOGE in your neighborhood. Become the neighborhood ATM. All those doge traded on the spot for cold hard cash. You're likely just going to put that money back into the bank and then get more DOGE with it anyway. Neighborhoods are starting to have their garage sales. Mine is an organized spring cleaning for a massive neighborhood. (So they get the gridlock out of the way in one weekend). 

Start advertising stuff in doge. ""Craftsmen 12"" tablesaw. 40000 DOGE"" with a link to doge. Then put up another ""40000 DOGE for $20"". And the guy will go"" Well fuck. I can buy that guy's doge for $20 and I getmyself something cheap!"". Offer 50% discounts on anyone purchasing in doge.

Give out free doge with every purchase. Attach $5 in doge in a paper wallet on all 'big ticket' items that cost $20+. 

Sell your services. (Legal services, ahem). Mow lawns for 5000 doge. Walk dogs for DOGE. Trade handywork or moving services for DOGE. This is what we need to drive the currency. Not just another cycle of mine/buy, donate, flood the exchange to go back to USD.

**Edit:** Parents, give your kids allowance in DOGE. Comic book stores start accepting DOGE. Pay that DOGE to a guy that makes 3D printings of comic book super heroes. Who spends that doge renting space at a local hacker space.

Doge could be the currency of the ""micro brewery"" movement for everything. The currency of hacker spaces and the amateur photographer.

But if you just take all the doge and donate it. That doge gets converted from doge to USD and the dodge just go back on the open market. It's like what happens on part of wall street Reddit so loves to hate. Don't pay trading fees, don't conform to the 'big bank' of doge, the exchanges. Be your own ATM for the neighborhood. Be the guy accepting doge at his garage sale. Be the guy tipping in tip threads.

Amateur photographers could put their doge address as a watermark in their photos. People could donate to the artist to buy the piece without the watermark or rights to use it. The photographer could be shooting a local skate park where a local skate hero has his doge QR code on his T-shirt. Just in case he does a stunt that goes viral on twitter or facebook. Where people from around the world can tip him for the stunt. He can take his doge to the local butcher and get some locally grown grass fed beef. The butcher pays the farmer for his doge...

It's like throwing a baseball up in the air. Converting it back to USD. Making it not about Doge = Doge but about Doge = USD. That, that is gravity pulling doge back to the ground. But spending it spending it is adding fuel to the booster rockets. Then once we are in space we can throw as much doge back to USD without it mattering. We are in space on the way to the moon. We could be the first coin on the moon.

personalfinance,"24 years old, earning $350 a month and living with my parents. Is moving out a good option?","Ok. So, I live in a 3rd world country. My apologies it's a too damn long post.

I earn $350 a month. I live with my parents. I don't pay any bills and I don't pay for food as long as I live with them. The only necessary expenses I have are work related, like lunch and my commute. I pay around $32.5 per month on food, $35 on my commute and $20 on my phone.

I have around $2,250 of savings. I invest them in a guy who gives me 5% interest rate every month. I don't withdraw of that money and the principal compounds. I also drop of whatever I save every month into the guy.

I know I could have probably reached $3,000 had I been a bit more frugal but I'm young and I kind of felt the need to at least taste a step up lifestyle from the 3rd world college kid lifestyle before that. Mostly I've bought core pieces from /r/malefashionadvice frugally, mostly uniqlos and some 2nd hand sneakers. I also go to starbucks occasionally. I don't eat out on food greater than $4 a pop though (yeah I can spend good money on coffee but I don't like to spend it on food lol).

On stepping up lifestyle thing, I also bought myself a macbook, an ipad and a nikon camera with lenses and accessories, but that was way before I started saving though, I just thought I should mention it so you'll get what I meant about wanting to step up the lifestyle. That's two years of me buying til the last drop of cash I have. But, I'm confident I'm over that binge so yeah, theres that.

I also don't have a girlfriend and I don't plan to have one at the time being. Partly because I'm a bit of a Ted Mosby and mostly because I don't find it practical, especially because I live in a country where you're expected to be serious about relationships, at least compared to what you're probably used to in the west. That and the expectation of you treating them...

So here comes the question. Should I move out of my parents house?

A bachelor pad (I don't know if you guys are familiar with the term?) can cost around $100-$130 a month. It's good for one person, has a kitchen and bathroom. Sometimes utility inclusive, sometimes not. I don't know how to cook, so I'll probably have to buy outside for probably $0.90 per meal, so including work lunch that's probably around $85 a month. I don't plan on getting wifi, because I have wifi at work. TV, I haven't watched TV in ages, I usually download episode to my laptop. Utilities... I honestly don't know how much utilities can cost me as I've never paid one ever but I'm guessing it's in the $20-$25  range for just me. I've mentioned that I no longer buy things to step up my lifestyle and I'm really determined to save every extra cash I have, so I'm confident that's pretty much all of my would be expenses. 

So... 

Rent $130
Food $85
Work Commute $35
Phone $20
Utilities $20

Work Income $350
 
That leaves me $60 more or less to drop to my guy. The estimates are all in the higher extremes, so I guess I can probably get as much as $90 of extra cash every month.

Another question: I know my guy and his 5% is risky. I'm planning to withdraw my money and put it in an index fund. I plan to raise my savings to $5,000 before withdrawing? Thoughts? I'll post details about my guy later if you want...

***edit 2:*** 

There is confusion with ""my guy"" being a loan shark.

The confusion probably comes from my usage of the term LENDER to describe my guy. It is a term in common usage in the Philippines, which I've now realized does not exist in American English. In fact, I think that the practice to which I am describing actually does not exist in the West.

Philippine English lesson. A LENDER is someone who operates a legitimate ""Lending Business."" He usually goes from house to house to meet his clients to grant loans and to claim the interest.

He is not a loan shark as far a Philippine English is concerned. Loan sharks are bad people connected with crime syndicates.

***edit:*** So this guy, to clarify is a lender in my hometown. He's been a lender for years. Way before I've invested in him, he's been a lender. Everyone I know has at least gotten a loan from him once. He's a lender first and investment guy second. Apparently he's very good at what he does. He now actually operates beyond my hometown. His lending business has grown too big for him to finance it himself and that's why he's been asking for investors. I'm not quite sure of the exact circumstance but I would guess that he probably once got short of money and he probably asked someone to finance it 50-50 on the 10% and boom, he probably caught the idea.

I rechecked everything, and realized I'd goofed and picked that TI part without realizing that 1.3A /switches/ doesn't mean the chip can actually source 1.3A as output.

personalfinance,How bad is it to intentionally allow a student account balance to go to collections? Need help evaluating my options,"I've put myself into a stupid situation financially and would appreciate advice.  In December I dropped out of a teaching program that was affiliated with a university, through which I was receiving federal loans to cover living expenses (the first year of teaching through this program was unpaid).  The last disbursement of the loan was scheduled for January and I received it even though I was not entitled to it due to being gone from the program at that point.  I immediately sent the entire amount of that disbursement ($6,700) to my student loan provider, thinking nothing of it and assuming the matter was settled.

I recently received a call from the university stating that I owed that $6,000.  I checked into it and the January disbursement of the loan never appeared on my student loan account - the $6,700 I put toward it went toward other loans from undergrad.  So the money was being handled by the university and not the federal government as I had assumed, and I had paid it to the wrong party.  

I'm struggling with what to do about this balance.  My options are to 1) set up a monthly payment plan 2) take out a back-balance loan to cover my debt or 3) do nothing and allow the balance to go to collections.  A monthly payment plan would be difficult for me to swing because the university only allows them to extend up to 6 months, which would mean I would have to pay over $1,000 a month.  My income is roughly $2,000 a month, my rent is $720, and the grace period for my student loans ends in June so starting in June I will be paying about $300 on top of that $1,000.  

Taking out a back-balance loan might be the best option but I currently have no private loans and I'm extremely unwilling to take one out due to the high interest rates.  

Lastly, I've read on here that when a debt goes to collections it's possible to negotiate with them to pay a lower amount and have it removed from my credit report.  I'm thinking this might be my best option in this case.  I'm worried about the temporary hit to my credit because my current lease expires in August and I plan on moving to a new place then, but there's a chance that the debt might not have even gone to collections by then, so my credit could feasibly still be okay at that point.  I don't plan on doing anything else (buying a house or car) that requires good credit anytime soon.

Am I an idiot for thinking that dealing with collections might be my best option?",finance,1395853312

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Alliance - Yours If You Want It,"Cross posted to bitcointalk

In the most recent episode of [Lets Talk Bitcoin](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/e95-the-captain-and-the-keep/), Anthony Di Lorio of The Canadian Bitcoin Alliance and Andreas Antonopoulos discuss the Bitcoin Foundation and The Global Bitcoin Alliance. Well worth a listen. I'm personally ambivalent to the politics of the former but do like the concept of a loose federation of groups grown from the ground up. To me, such an alliance of people helping themselves fits well with the bootstrapped nature of the blockchain.

In the next few years, beyond the early adopter phase, tens of thousands of business people and millions of ordinary citizens are going to form thousands of adhoc groups trying to get to grips with this thing. They will come together to learn, to brainstorm, to collaborate and to share.

In the spirit of decentralised organisation, I have set up a site at [http://thebitcoinalliance.com](http://thebitcoinalliance.com) and offer it free to anyone wishing to use it. You do not need to be a member of any club and do not need to pay a joining fee or subs. This is a service to the community and if the Global or Canadian Alliance wish to take it over, I will donate it to them as long as they leave it free for anyone to use and membership to the wider alliance remains optional. 

Intended as a work-space and a way to make and maintain connections, you can form or join groups – semi-public or private - to discuss a subset of your interest. This is a blank space to use as you wish. Create a forum, make connections, form discussions based on a project, location, language or topic. Find experts. Make things happen or chew the fat.

I'm a writer, not an entrepreneur and have asked no-one's permission to do this. Although I align myself with the aims of The Global Bitcoin Alliance, I represent no-one and will not speak on anyone's behalf. I simply like Di Lorio's and Antonopoulous' approach and have taken the logical next step. Crypto currencies and trustless networks are set to change the world. They will foster the next wave of decentralisation and self-determination. To that end, we need tools to connect and network. Until we can turn it into a DAC, I hope this will be a useful compromise.

Bitcoin,"I am a tax attorney, here is what the IRS notice means to you","**Edit:  This post discusses the tax treatment for US Citizens.  I thought that was apparent when the IRS is involved, but apologies if the title confused any non-US bitcoin users.**

Hey guys, I've received a lot of questions about the IRS notice and how it affects [the post I wrote a couple of months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1uccfz/i_am_a_tax_attorney_here_are_my_answers_to_the/)  The short answer is that nothing really changes, other than we can stop speculating about possible tax treatments in the event bitcoin is treated as a foreign currency.  I've updated my post to reflect this change.  

Here's a quick rundown of the how the Notice affects most people. Just keep in mind that these topics are covered in more detail in the original post in case you want more information.

**#1 Bitcoins are property, not foreign currency.**  
This means that capital gains treatment will apply to most people.  This really isn't a surprise and basically everyone expected this result (although some hoped for the longshot possibility of foreign currency treatment).  The biggest exception is if you are engaged in a trade or business and hold bitcoin as inventory for sale to customers.  This is probably  a pretty small group of people, though.  

**#2 Every bitcoin transaction is taxable.**  
As I said in my first post, Bitcoin users will have to calculate their gain or loss every time they purchase goods or services with bitcoin.  Yes, this is a very onerous burden and creates a significant threat to the widespread adoption of bitcoin.  However, this outcome is not very surprising and is consistent with US tax laws. Hopefully the Treasury Department or Congress can be convinced to apply a ""personal transaction"" exception similar to the one that exists for foreign currency. But for now, this is how it will have to work.   

When calculating your gain or loss, you must determine ""amount realized"" and ""basis.""  When buying goods or services with bitcoin, the amount realized is equal to the fair market value of whatever you received.  When selling bitcoin, the amount realized is the sales price less any transaction fees.   

The biggest issue for most bitcoin users is determining their basis.  Because bitcoins are fungible, you run into the problem of tracing the cost of each bitcoin you hold.  You cannot just arbitrarily choose your basis.  The IRS will permit you to use the FIFO method (First in, First out).  Any other method such as LIFO or Average Cost Basis is not advisable, particularly now that we know foreign currency rules do not apply.  

**#3 Miners recognize income in the year the bitcoin is mined.**

This was a big unresolved question prior to the Notice.  The amount of income is equal to the market value of bitcoin on the day it was mined.  You can use any exchange price as long as its reasonable and you use it consistently going forward.  The market price also becomes your basis in that bitcoin going forward.  Therefore, when you sell it sometime in the future, you will subtract this amount from the sales price in order to determine your taxable gain.  

Note that you can deduct your mining expenses in the same year, such as electricity and depreciation (subject to loss limitations).  

**#4 Miners are subject to self-employment tax if their activity rises to the level of a trade or business.**

The IRS notice did not provide any guidance on when a mining activity constitutes a trade or business.   A ""trade or business"" is generally defined as an activity engaged in on a substantial and continuing basis for the purpose of generating a profit.  This does not have to a full-time activity, just one that you regularly pursue with a profit motive.   Obviously, whether or not your specific activity is a ""trade or business"" depends on your particular situation.  The more substantial and continuous your activity, the more likely it is that you're a trade or business.  You can read a little bit more about the test [here](http://www.bitcointaxsolutions.com/is-my-mining-activity-a-business/). If your mining activity consists of more than just an old GPU card (or two), I suggest you consult with a tax professional to determine if you're a trade or business.  You'll also need to get guidance on making estimated Self Employment tax payments (which is done in quarterly deposits with the IRS).  

**#5 The IRS Notice is retroactive.**

Okay, ""retroactive"" is not technically the right term.  The law has not changed, the IRS is just informing everybody of how they interpret it.  But, they will apply these interpretations to past tax years as well as the current one.  So, if you already filed 2013 taxes (or earlier years) in a manner not consistent with the Notice, you should consider amending your return because the IRS will apply the rules in the Notice to your situation. 

Feel free to ask any questions.

investing,Should I buy points to buy down the interest rate of my mortgage or invest that money elsewhere?,"First time buyer here. Like many, I've decided it'd be a better (and cheaper) decision for me to buy than rent in this crazy rental market here. My goal is to find a place to live for 2-5 years then keep it indefinitely as a rental property. I'm looking for a walkable condo close to the downtown area of the neighborhood in which I grew up.

I found a 715 sq ft HomePath condo which would be perfect for what I'm trying to do. I'll likely be taking advantage of the HomePath mortgage offered, but I want to do whatever is going to be best financially in the long term. This place was originally listed for $113,000, which I wasn't interested in paying. They recently dropped the price to $97,000, so I called my realtor and toured it that same day. It needs quite a bit of work, but nothing too major. Every wall will need to be repainted, it needs new floors/carpet throughout, and the bathroom floor feels a bit soft (I suspect a complete remodel is in order). The kitchen has been nicely remodeled and won't need any attention.

I had my realtor write up an offer for $90,000, but before she submitted it she talked to the listing agent, who advised her it has two other offers. She told me she was able to get him to give her a number he thinks would be accepted, which was $103,500 (bank netting $100,000 after $3,500 closing assistance). I told her I was comfortable with that, as I really do want this property and believe it is a good value. That was Sunday, so now I'm waiting to hear back from Fannie Mae about whether the offer was accepted.

Have I thrown up any red flags yet??

I began collecting all the documents I needed for the mortgage and talking to the broker who pre-approved me, who has been absolutely wonderful to work with. The thing is, I don't know much about personal finance or mortgages aside from how to budget and save. I thought my FICO score was around 660, so I was ecstatic when she told me I was pre-approved and that my average score was actually 776. I didn't know about shopping around for mortgages, or the two-week hard pull window (which has passed), so I went with the first person someone recommended. As I said, I have no reason to not believe this is a good deal, and she's been great to work with, I just want to get a few other knowledgeable opinions.

I'm the type of person who likes to error on the side of caution, especially when it comes to financial math. I don't have a high monthly income, and what I do make varies, but I have managed to save $32,000. Due to my the variable nature of my income, having a low monthly payment is important to me, but only if it makes good financial sense. If my offer is accepted, and I make a minimum down payment of $5,175 (5%), my total financed amount will be $98,325. Rounding up to $7000 for other costs, that would leave me $25,000.

My mortgage broker has been working with a 4.75% interest rate and a total of $4400 in closing costs, but hasn't given me a breakdown yet as to what those costs entail. I asked today, but she's out of the office until tomorrow. Does this seem in line with what I should expect?

This leads me to my next question of whether I should use more of my savings to

My plan is to invest $12,000 into this place, with a high budget of $15,000, leaving me $10,000 in savings, which I could use to buy points or increase the down payment. If neither of these are worth it, I'll just invest a bit in my IRA and call it good. Please keep in mind, though I intend to pay off this property as quickly as possible, I also intend on keeping it indefinitely.

personalfinance,Tax Day Coming- Did I Mess Up?,"I filed my taxes in February, but since then I've been worried I should have used a tax professional...

Is it normal to not have any deductions or did I maybe do something wrong? Is there any way to correct this if I could have gotten more back?

personalfinance,HSA health insurance or not?,"I already asked some plan question, but now have an HSA specific question...continued help is very appreciated!

My wife's insurance plan changes on July 1st. My company goes Jan. 1 to Dec 31st. This qualifies her to change her own plan or join mine on July 1st (as well as give me the option to switch mine on July 1st).

She is due to have our first baby in August. I've been running the numbers to try to see what makes the most sense. All of the non-HSA plans have large copays and deductibles for delivery, ranging from $450 to $840. With an out of pocket max set at $2k on one plan and $5k on the two others.

I'm leaning toward the HSA plan, even though with my estimates the PPO might be a cheaper, I worry that the estimates might be more off and I'll end up paying more out of pocket. Also, given that I know my wife will chew through the $1250 deductible on the HSA plan, that is the ceiling she will pay on all services the rest of the year, so don't need to worry about losing more. The max more we'd have to spend out of pocket would be $1250 for myself or our child if need be, but I'd assume if something big happened we'd be paying somewhat on another plan.

The only thing that jumps out is if the hospital bills my wife for some against he deductible and then the baby, that would mean I end up paying more than $1250 out of pocket.

The other thing that seems attractive to me is getting an HSA in a year I know I will hit the deductible, at least for my wife. I'm thinking maybe I should max the HSA for the year @ $6450 which would save me from a 33% Federal tax rate and 5.3% for Massachusetts. 

In a worst case scenario, I will spend $2500 out of pockets on deductibles this year and still have $3950 left in an HSA.

Even if I switch back to a PPO on Jan. 1 2015 (which I expect to, given what I have been warned about the health care expenses of a baby), I'll still have at least $3950 of tax free money that I can use at any point over the next 35 years for health care expense. 

Am I missing something or does this make a lot of sense?",finance,1395875080

I'm in Australia and graduated last year (2013) from high school. I've gotten a Cert III in Business (Not sure of the U.S equivalent of that.) since then, and have an interview tomorrow for a really good temp government job. I'm optimistic. There are also opportunities for a permanent position, but that's a bit too far in the future to worry about now. 

The pay is 42.5k gross pa, 12% superannuation, but the contract is for 6 months so I'll make half of that. This will be the first time I make any 'real' money that I'm not OK with mindlessly blowing on stupidity, partying and...well, wasting. I still live at home and I'm not sure if I'll be paying rent or not once I get a job, but for the foreseeable future I have no expenses outside of $7 on the bus for daily travel and entertainment. 

*Would that mean I only get 6% superannuation of 42.5k, or 12% on the 21k or so I'll make in the 6 months? 

* How do I choose a good superannuation fund?

* Any tips for how to organise a budget, or should I just mindlessly save as much as I can until I'm left with 18k (post tax + post 6 months of expenses) at the end of it? 

* I currently have two student accounts from when I was under 18. As far as I know, student accounts have much higher interest rates and very few, if any, administrative charges. Are there any ceilings on how much I can put in those accounts before the bank demands I open an 'adult' bank account? 

* On that note; credit cards. Are they worth investing in, just for a good credit rating (Like in the U.S.A) or should I avoid them altogether? What's the better option in Australia? 

* How should I go about taxes? I know I'm applicable because the limit is 18k pa and I'll be making about 21k gross in 6 months. Should I get receipts for everything and keep them, or just for things that are work-related? Do I have to manually set aside money for tax, or is it automatically deducted from my salary? If someone could just explain the tax system in general, I'd be very appreciative.

personalfinance,Need help deciding which debt to pay off first.,"My husband and I have recently started budgeting to get ourselves out of debt and basically plan for our future (emergency fund, home renovations, kids, new car, vacations, etc.).  We've calculated that we have about 1300 buckaroos to pay toward something, the question is what.  Our debt consist of our mortgage (just bought a house a little over a year ago), my car, my student loans, and a small personal loan.  We've read that the best strategy to go with for getting out of debt is to pay off the smallest balance first and let the amount that you had been paying snowball onto the next lowest balance, and so on.  My hubby thinks we should also consider the interest rates for the loans and the potential roll-over amount that will be available to pay on the next item in addition to the total balance.  Our mortgage is pretty substantial and the small personal loan has a 0% interest rate so we aren't considering those to begin with.  Our plan so far is to pay off the car and some higher interest rate student loans in the next 1-1.5 years.

We still owe a little over 18,000K on the car, the interest is 3.65%, and the payment we currently make is just shy of 550 bucks.  I owe 35,500K on my student loans but the balance for the ones with the higher interest rate (6.55%) is a 16,100K, and we currently pay 500 bucks a month, but the roll-over amount would be 200 bucks when only the higher rate loans are paid off.  If we really stick to our budget, we have 1,300 bucks a month to put towards something while still being able to built up our emergency fund.

So I'm wondering if it's smarter to pay off the balance for the car first even though the interest rate and total balance is less than the student loans and apply that 500 bucks toward the loan payment in addition to the 1300 when the car is paid off,

Or

Should we concentrate on the student loans first because the balance is lower and the interest rate is higher, even though the amount that would roll over to the car is only 200 bucks.

Something else to consider is the tax rebate we get for the interest paid on the student loans each year when we do our taxes.  I'm just looking for some advice on the matter, hope you guys can help us out.",finance,1395900710
Forex,Is Hedging Really A Strategy?,"I'm a scalper as I have a very low risk tolerance and right now I'm just not in the ""zone"" in predicting the markets and so sitting on the fence with my trades, I took up the hedging strategy found over on forexfactory (circular pairs). Anyways, just wondering if hedging my risk and then attempting to profit from off correlation is really a strategy? 

I currently long GBPNZD, short GBPUSD, and short NZDUSD. If the positions are not in profit, then I'll just accumulate the daily interest rate differentials. If they are in profit, I'll let them run and then look for possible reversals and then exit out there. I don't have a lot of experience in this hedging context so just wondering if it actually makes sense to do something like this?",finance,1395900782

investing,How to make money investing,"Some ideas

The stock market will always go up.  Rallies and bears happen but overall over 100 years+ the stock market grows 8-10% a year.  It is easy to make money but, measure your results against the S&amp;P 500 if all your stock capital was in it.

If you want to be rich you must put off expenses today for future benefit that's how the economy works.  First pay off your debt that is higher than 5% a year interest.  Next you must save money only buy what you really need, Warren Buffett still does this today.  You must invest your money in index etfs and keep saving.  You can consider diversifying between S&amp;P 100,400,500,600 and dow jones.  Now you must weight how much time you can spend studying the market to find better investments.  Max out your Roth IRA/401k taxes kill returns.  Oh make sure to pay taxes too, jail kills returns.

For your indexing when the market drops 20% you should consider throwing a party, and when it drops 50% like in 2008 you might as well party Wolf of Wall Street style.  Essentially since we know the market goes up you need to pile as much money as you can afford in for the long haul.  Don't try to time tops.  Oh when you see the market double in 5 years on new highs (late 90s) or when the news says ""Lehman brothers bankrupt"" be cautious and wait for a nice discount price on the S&amp;P.

SKIP HERE FOR MORE RISK

So you decide to dedicate 4 hours+ a week on investing and think you can beat the market.  Maybe you want to be Warren Buffett.  Side note Buffett spent long hours working for his success and sacrificed his personal family life for a higher return, decide what matters to you in life.

Oh I forgot you are currently laughing at indexing because you trippled your money in a leveraged out of the money option call.  You can beat the market in the short term, but over 40 years your get rich quick method will always fail.  

During your research you must use technical and fundamental analysis. Start with a fundamental idea some examples: Solar sounds like a good idea, in order to keep up with mobile devices our infrastructure needs to be upgraded to allow fast internet everywhere, aging population will lead to an increase in healthcare, and maybe banks will make good returns on all this innovation.  Next select a good amount of companies that perform your fundamental idea.  Compare revenue, earnings, price to book ratios, debt ratio, profit margin, Ect.  These ratios are shorthand for how Buffett values companies.  Perhaps you find a company with great cash flow, low debt, consistent profit, and a great fundamental idea like Coca Cola.  Use technical oscillators (RSI, MACD, Stochastics, Ect.) along with resistance bands to enter your company at a profitable time.  Keep in mind this is an investment you should hold forever.  I once heard someone say 80% of movement in a companies stock is due to the general market so always keep an eye on the S&amp;P.  This is why all stocks seem to go up and down in general unison with exceptions here and there.  Huge established bluechip companies can fit this criteria and be great for growth.  You need to invest a huge amount of time to beat the market it often takes up a full time job.

Everyone else already prices a company on expected growth.  You have to figure out why something has more value than it's current price or something everyone else is overlooking.  

Options, futures, forex, bonds, Ect:

You can enter some of your ideas after research with options and futures.  Options give you leverage so you can control sometimes 100 shares of stock for the price of 1 share.  You should fully understand options before using them.  In one instance a banker bankrupted a 150 year old bank buying put options at the wrong time. You can use this website to estimate your risk www.optionsprofitcalculator.com

Don't look at penny stocks please.  I like trading bonds after a large market crash.  Interest rates go down when bonds go up and vise versa.  When the fed drives interest rates to 0 buy a long term bond etf with leverage.  I see interest rates increasing in the next 10 years so bonds will be going down.

Last thoughts:

Never panic
Be able to write a list of reasons why you made a trade.
The index will beat most people here in the long run.
Dividens are your friend always reinvest them.
Leave time for what you care most about in life.
There are other investments (lending club) which offers 5%-9% a year in return.  Consider factoring in CDs and other investments to hedge against risky option trades.
Don't look at mutual funds fees kill returns, unless you are forced to in a company 401k.  If you must buy mutual funds invest in the top 3 for the last 5 years and rebalance every few years.  Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world.

I aim to beat the market but not by much.  I hope to average 9-13% in the next 60 years (I'm 18) which is pretty ambitious.  I'm not Warren Buffett and I can't pick winning companies so I like entering indexes and sectors at opportune times.  Of course I leave some side cash to mess around with options.

personalfinance,[NY Metropolitan area] 25 Y/O starting to invest?,"Hi PF,

I've made a throwaway to give as much information as possible. I am 25 years old and graduated from a private university (no loans) with a degree in Biology. I do not use this degree in my current job.

Job History:
I worked in politics for two years out of college - one year on a senator's campaign staff and another year on a retired airforce general's congressional campaign in a swing state of the 2012 election cycle. After, I became a private investigator for 8 months resulting in the job I have now as a paralegal.

I have a decent skill set. I am handy and good with computers. I can troubleshoot/diagnose, etc. Parents are both computer engineers so I knew how to type a URL at 5 years old. I can proof read and review documents well. Other skills include: public speaking, diagnosing and fixing business inefficiencies, e.g: law firms, political campaigns; messaging and speech writing (akin to propaganda but now known as ""Public Relations"") and the art of persuasion. Point being I am not dumb but I lack direction in individually profiting off of my skills.

Career Objectives: 
Ideally, I wish to do as much good on a society level while making money. I am not materialistic, rather I enjoy experiences and interactions. I plan enrolling in law school in the next 2.

Financial History and Breakdown:
I come from a well off family but I am unsure what investments they have for me, if any. They very kindly pay for my car insurance and cellphone bill. They are always available to help out but seldom do I ask. 

I left home 6 months ago. I lived at my aunts for 5 months rent free and have now moved into a studio with my girlfriend. I pay $650 a month for rent, utilities and cable. 

Breakdown: 
Salary: $409 per week after taxes=$1636 per month.

 I am getting a salary increase April 1st of $400 additional per month and the same on May 1st. 

Current salary: $500 before taxes, $409 after taxes
Expected salary come May 1st: $730 before taxes, $XXX (I don't know calculations exactly).

Expenses:
$650 a month for rent, utilities, cable/internet

$200 a month for food (Estimated) groceries

$160 a month for gas - I bought a used car last year. 2007 honda accord, 70k mi

$400 a month for I have no idea. I waste a lot of money on small stupid things that pile up. It's horrible.

Total: $1410. 


Current Bank Balances:
A citibank regular checking: $440
Maspeth Federal Savings Bank checking: $100

Bad credit history of allowing a secured credit card get maxed and incur $160 in fees. The bank closed the card and subtracted the fees after taking the secured money I deposited (rightly so) - so I'm unsure what to do about that if the balance shows $0. I maxed this card during my three month unpaid paralegal internship that eventually landed me my current job. 

I need to catalog my expenses and expenditures in an effort to curb stupid spending and promote fiscal responsibility. 

My questions are:
1) I get paid weekly and am left with $288 after setting aside bill money. I use $150 as weekly operating money, cigarettes, gas, lunch at work, etc. What should I do with $130 a week or $520 a month? I am interested in investing Vanguards small cap growth ETF I think it is called? I have a friend who invests heavily and he recommended I start with that fund. What are some investments that are short term (2-3 years) but high yield? Is peer to peer lending a viable option for this short desired term?

2) What do I do with that closed secured credit card? It has a $0 balance on it and I have dodged every single phone call. How do I build my credit back up? Do I do another secured credit card?

3) I need some more work clothes which require a suit or at least a dress shirt, tie and dress pants. I want to get high quality long lasting shirts/ties/pants - It is how I roll in this regard. How do I factor purchases like this into my budget?

personalfinance,Emergency Fund vs. Student Loans,"Hello personalfinance. I currently have about $9,500 saved and am expecting $1,000 tax refund. I have 2 student loans that I could feasibly pay off with this money. One is my federal loans (unsubsidized) with a balance of about $10,000 and an average interest rate of 5%. The other is a Sallie Mae loan with a balance of about $7,800 and an interest rate of 3.25% (variable). If I pay off these loans, that would deplete my savings and I wouldn't have much of emergency fund.

I'd like to know if it would be better to hang onto my emergency funds or pay off the loans. I'm leaning toward paying off the loans because I'd really like to decrease my debt burden. I have a third student loan with payments that are $367. Also, which of the two would be better to pay off? Does it matter? Thank you for your advice.",finance,1395926685
personalfinance,"I thought this was an easy question, but then I started thinking about it... (Mortgage vs. personal loan)","Here's the details:

$12,000 owed on a timeshare mortgage at 11.75% interest. Will be paid off by 2021.

$2,500 owed on a car note with a 1% interest rate. Will be paid off this November.

Our original plan was once the car was paid off we'd increase the payments to the mortgage to pay it off sooner, but at 11.75% does it make better sense to take out a personal loan to pay it off?

My credit union offers a personal loan rate of 8.99% for 48 months - which means we'd be paying off the mortgage sooner, but wouldn't be able to deduct the mortgage interest from our tax returns going forward.

EDIT: Aside from getting rid of the timeshare... I guess it makes more sense to take out the personal loan. I know 11.75% is absurd. It sounds like even taking the mortgage interest deduction into account isn't worthwhile. Once the car is paid off we can more than double our payment to the timeshare loan so it will be paid off faster.",finance,1395928054

Leave a comment at the end if you have any tips to share that you don’t see here.
Her we go:
#1  Go Naked With Credit
Credit cards are not your friend.  You spend more overall when you use them, and carrying a balance (like the majority of card holders do) incurs interest and fees that increase your cost of living.  The convenience is not worth it.  Go naked and stop using credit for good.

#2  Pay Yourself First
Pay yourself first, before the credit card companies and car payments.  Put a designated amount of money into savings and investments before paying anyone else.  Waiting to put money into savings and investments with what’s left after paying all the bills rarely works well.  Have that money automatically deducted from your paycheck and put into a 401k, IRA, or other investment account.  If you do that automatically, you won’t even have to think about it.

#3  Put Money Into Retirement Accounts
When you pay yourself first, this is where much of that money should go.  You can contribute to an IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, 403b, or whatever plan may be available to you.  Your first priority should be to contribute to accounts where your employer matches your contributions.

#4 Go Cash Only
Once you ditch the credit cards, use only cash to finance your life.  “Cash” also includes checks and debit cards.  When you use cash, you know you have a limited supply and you’re more thoughtful about your spending.  I prefer to use cash in an envelope system.

#5 Invest In Yourself
Invest in knowledge and skills that make you more valuable to your employer or your own business.  Mastering new technologies and skills almost always translates into more money through raises, job promotions, or increased business. 

#6 Spend Less Than You Make
It sounds obvious, but most people don’t do it.  Living on less than you make is not hard to do when you go cash only and consistently do a written monthly budget.  Most people who are in debt are spending more than they make every single year.  Much like the federal government, this is unsustainable in the long run.  Stop making excuses and just do it.

#7 Make a Budget
I’ve been preaching this for years and I won’t stop.  Do a written budget every month, spending your money on paper before you spend it in the real world.  A written budget is the absolute best tool you can use to get complete control over your money, spend less than you make, and stop living paycheck to paycheck.  I wrote THE book on how to make a budget that works.  You can check it out here.

#8 Be Valuable to Your Employer
If you work for someone else, make sure to become so valuable that you can’t be ignored.  The more value you bring to your employer on a daily basis, the more likely you are to get raises, promotions, and other recognition.  Most employees are just there for the paycheck, and prove it by doing average work.  Making the effort to be above average always pays off.

#9 Get Out of Debt
Debt serves as a drag on your finances and your life.  When you use it, you always pay more than if you had just used cash instead.  Make a plan to get out of debt, work that plan to completion, and you’ll be shocked at how freeing it can be to live without debt payments dragging you down.

#10 Learn Positivity
Having a positive attitude is a choice.  Recognize when you’re acting or talking in a negative way, and learn to counteract those negative words and actions with positive self talk and actions.  Relentlessly positive people get more done and bounce back from failures much quicker than negative people.

#11 Hang With The Right People
I don’t mean this in a shallow way, as in making friends just to get something out of someone.  Hang with people who share your values and are positive, successful people.  When you hang out with these people you’re more likely to emulate them and learn from them.  Keep the negative Nellies at arms length.  Just like your momma said, you are who you hang out with.

#12 Be a Giver
You can’t truly be a financial success unless you give some of your money away.  The more you have, the more generous you should be.  I recommend at least tithing 10%, as well as giving additional amounts on top of that.  The Bible says repeatedly that when you’re a giver, you will have at least what you need, and you will even have an abundance, which allows you to be even more generous.  Giving is a virtuous cycle.

#13 Change Your Mindset
You have to learn to think about money and wealth differently.  You can’t think about money like the average person who is in debt and broke.  When you learn to think about money the same way that a millionaire does, it will open your eyes to new possibilities and get you moving in the right direction financially.  Here’s a couple of great books that had a huge impact on how I view money:
“Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki
“The Cashflow Quadrant” by Robert Kiyosaki
You can find many others in the CFF bookstore

#14 Maintain an Emergency Fund
You WILL have an emergency that requires money to fix!  When you are prepared for the inevitable car breakdown or water heater explosion, you’ll have cash to deal with the problem on the spot, instead of having to deal with payments and interest for months or even years because you weren’t prepared and had to go into debt.  You can read more about how to start an emergency fund here.

#15 Own a Home
Over the long term, owning a home is better than renting.  It doesn’t always have a high return as an investment, but owning a home does build long term wealth as you build up equity over time.  As you get the home paid off, you won’t have the problem of paying ever increasing rent in your old age as your income declines.

#16 Learn How to Invest
Beanie Babies and action figures won’t cut it!  Learn how to invest in mutual funds, index funds, real estate, your own business, etc.  You need to make sure your money is making money for you.  Here are a couple of good books to get you started:
 ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"" by John C. Bogle
""Common Sense on Mutual Funds"" by John C. Bogle and David F. Swenson



#17 Keep a Happy Marriage
Studies have shown that a happy marriage can be key to building wealth, as well as a healthy, happy life.  Work on your marriage consistently to continue making the relationship stronger over time.  An unhappy marriage or a divorce has huge costs to emotional happiness and monetary wealth.  Here are a few posts on money and marriage you might find helpful.

#18  Be Healthy
Eat right, exercise, get rid of stress, and maintain balance in your life.  When you pay attention to your physical and mental health, you’re happier, have more energy, and are more productive.  Taking care of your body and mind through healthy habits allows for a longer, higher quality life, and allows you to be more able to care for the needs of yourself and others that depend on you.

#19 Get Insured
Make sure you have health insurance, life insurance, home insurance, disability, and any other insurance that will protect you and your family against an unforeseen disaster that can ruin you financially.  These things happen more often than you realize, so be prepared.

#20 Pay Cash For Used Cars
Yes, you can pay cash for your next car.  I’ve done it twice now, and it feels so great to not have car payments any more!  Here’s how you can pay cash for your cars until you die or the kids take away the keys.

#21 Feed Your Spirit
We weren’t put on this earth to live only for ourselves.  Connect with God through a robust prayer life, studying His word, service to others, and fellowshipping with other believers.  You can’t be truly rich without God in your life.

It’s About Action and Consistency
When it comes down to it, setting up your finances for massive success is not just about money.  It’s about achieving bigger and better things in every area of your life, and not letting yourself be exposed to unnecessary problems that can be prevented by being diligent.
The key to all of these is action and consistency.  When you actively integrate these things into your life and turn them into habits, that’s when you’ll get the maximum benefits from them.
You certainly shouldn’t attempt to do all these at once or you will be overwhelmed.  Pick one or two at a time to work on, and proceed from there.

We are saving for a wedding that will be here in May. After that, we will have about $1,300 a month to either go towards debt payoff or saving for a house. We would like to have a house in 3 years but with our debt, but we understand may not be possible. 

We live in Chicago so cost of living is a little higher than where we grew up. No car payments but we are looking to move this time next year possibly and will both need cars. 

I guess what I really want to know is what makes the most sense here? We both want a house in 3 years. Does it make sense to save half and pay more over time AND get a house soon? Or is it pay everything off and worry about a house later? I do my best to throw just about everything extra to our debt. We aren't missing any payments but we don't live lavishly either.

investing,Why Invest in Real Estate?,"Purchasing and investing in real estate has always been attractive for those that are looking to generate additional income and benefit from the wealth created with increases in property values over time. Is investing in real estate right for you?

The Attraction

Diversification is key to anyone’s investment portfolio whether you are talking about mutual funds, TFSA’s, stocks, bonds, RESP’s, RRSP’s etc. Diversification helps balance risk and provides a level of confidence that your investments are still going to be there when you are ready to liquidate them, such as at retirement etc. Some would consider adding real estate, other than their principal home, to their portfolio to ensure full diversification.

A real estate investor can still use a relatively small amount of down payment or capital to purchase a property, and this can provide an attractive return on investment (or ROI). This return is generated from a combination of monthly income and property value increases.

The monthly income is generated by taking the rent collected from tenant and then deducting all the expenses. To ensure that there is a positive cash flow, smart real estate investors work with a mortgage expert and real estate agent that can assist with the analysis.

Equity is built in the property by way of appreciation of value over time as well as with each mortgage payment. With mortgage interest rates at record lows and an abundance of potential tenants in many areas, there is a high demand for real estate investors to take the plunge.

Here’s another way to look at it as well... real estate investment is also beneficial for those who have a hard time saving money, as it can act as a sort of forced savings account. Essentially, as you pay down the principal of a mortgage, you're reducing debt and building equity. Then, when you go to sell the property, the money you receive back from the sale is considered your “forced savings”.

So What is the Risk?

Like any investment, there is risk and it is possible to lose money in real estate, albeit relatively low. Real estate has shown to appreciate steadily over the long term, and has for the past 25 years, so the chances of someone losing money on a purchase are pretty slim. However, keep in mind that doing your due diligence before an actual purchase is key... you must take into consideration certain factors when choosing a property, such as desirability of location and stability of the market in that area.",finance,1395935577

personalfinance,Should I (21) buy a house? (Canada),"First off, thanks for taking the time to read this and provide advice.

I want to start by stating my current position.

I am 21 years old and am employed by the Federal Government of Canada. I live and work in the National Capital Region. I consider this a very secure position. I would be buying the house with my SO of three years (also 21). He also works for the Federal GoC, and is also in a very secure position. We have lived together for almost the entirety of our relationship, save for a couple months at the beginning. We are not married but we plan on getting married within two years.

We are currently renting a townhome in the suburbs. Rent is $1500/month, and our utilities come to $400 altogether, for hydro, gas, water, and internet.

The only debt I currently have is ~7000 in a car loan that I took out earlier this year. We have no credit card debt. My SO has ~$15,000 of student loan debt, and I have ~35,000, although my parents are using the money they have set aside to pay it off in its entirety. I am only graudating at the end of April, so it isn't time to pay off these loans yet. 

Our joint monthly incomes are around $6000, although come May my SO will be getting a raise, making our monthly income around $7500.

We currently do not have an emergency fund, and I am aware that we need to build this up before we even consider buying a house. Note that we are looking to buy a house in September or October, which gives us plenty of time to built that up.

Our down payment would be $15,000, maybe a little bit more. We have an additional $5000 set aside for closing costs, such as inspections, lawyer fees, taxes, etc. We were pre-approved for a mortgage a year ago when we had only $10,000 saved up and were making significantly less money for $240,000. We didn't go through with it because it was too much of a rushed decision, and we decided we would think about it more and keep renting in the meantime. 

It is both of our financial goals to be homeowners as soon as reasonably possible. Both of us are also very handy and we look forward to putting work into a house, making repairs and renovations ourselves, and learning on the way. We also are surrounded by family who work in the trades who are happy to help us learn anything we may need to know in accomplishing these tasks. If and when we buy a house, it will only be if it is in a good enough condition that we can be almost certain it won't need any major fixes (such as septic or anything else that expensive) within a year. We also won't be doing it until we have an additional $5000 in our account for anything that may happen to the house, such as a burst pipe.

Edit to add - we have not been pre-approved for a mortgage this year. We wanted to beef up or savings accounts a bit more and also be certain that this is feasible for us before we got the banks involved. 

Another edit - We will be staying in the area for AT LEAST 5 years, although I don't see us going anywhere in the next 10 years (things can change though..)

Please let me know if I've left out any necessary information. Thanks in advance.",finance,1395936208

Bitcoin,"After getting blocked by the subscription pay wall at WashingtonPost.com, I wrote this message to customer service","Hey, if I could make micro payments for each article I read, I would probably binge read the Post and give you folks lots of money. 

But the subscription model is a tough sell, mainly because I don't want the hassle of having to cancel another recurring credit card payment.  Ancestry.com has already fooled me once.  

Now, I can probably assume that you are against micro payments because the credit card swipe fees make it seem uneconomical.  One option is to do what iTunes does, and wait until approximately $10 of charges have been amassed before running the charge.  

But let me suggest a better option: accept Bitcoin for per article micro payments.  If you don't want the volatility risk of holding Bitcoins, use one of the BTC payment processors (like Bitpay) that will convert the payments into cash at the end of each day.  You'll never have to hold any Bitcoins. Just cash.  Sweet, sweet cash.  

You could charge .002 bitcoins (about $1) per article (or even per segment of a long article).  If that was an option, I probably would've spent $10 reading WaPo articles in the time it took for me to write you this message.  

This just seems like a no-brainer business decision because the potential reward substantially outweighs what is basically zero risk. Seriously. What's the worst that could happen?  Nothing.  You just go back to normal if it doesn't work out.  There's no long term contracts or infrastructure investment, thus no sunk costs.  Even in the virtually impossible scenario  you made no money from it, you'd still be able to write up a killer first-hand critique of why the Bitcoin model is flawed. 

What's the upside?  Only revolutionizing the way people consume digital written content.  And its about time because let's face it, the subscription model is dead.  Subscriptions were designed for an era when you couldn't choose to consume and pay for only the parts of a newspaper you wanted.  You had to buy the whole thing whether you liked sports or not.  It is ridiculously stupid and stubborn to persist in trying to make this model work in the digital age.  

I'll leave you with this.  

Fourteen years ago, if people wanted to buy that awesome song they heard  on the radio, they had to buy the entire album.  Even if it was Blind Melon and the only song you wanted was ""No Rain"" - you still had to spend $15 for all of the crappy filler songs too.  Then Napster came along, and all of a sudden people were like ""ZOMG! I don't have to get the crappy album!"" When Napster finally died, the rest of the music industry went back to CD's.  Except for this one guy named Steve, who was like ""Hey, why don't we just set up a legit version of Napster where people can pay $0.99 per song instead of stealing them?""  And the rest of the music industry scoffed, ""No one will ever do that! HAHAHA! MORON!""  Of course, Steve's iTunes store is now the world's largest retailer of music and it has fundamentally revolutionized the way we buy music, movies, television, and more.

Eventually, someone is going to do the same thing with journalism.  Subscriptions are a dead end, and no one's buying luxury yachts with pop-up ad revenue. Like iTunes did with music, micro payments per article are the future of online journalism. Bitcoin is one technology that can make this happen.",cryptocurrency,1395982051

My father recently passed away and I am coming in to $120,000 of life insurance money. My GF and I would like to pay off our debts, and make a 3 hour move from Huntington, WV to Louisville, KY.

I am 32 years old, my girlfriend is 31 years old. 

Our Debts:
Me - $15,000 Credit Card debt, all with US Bank. Shitty interest rates on all of it. They are old credit cards from 10+ years ago.
Her - $15,000 Federal Student Loan, and approx $30,000 medical bill debt.

What would be the most efficient way to tackle the pay off of this debt? My intent is to pay off this debt in full, no more payments. I have been told by a few people that it wouldn't be worth paying off her $30,000 of medical debt as it won't impact her credit rating and they will not legally pursue suing her in court for the money. For her Federal Student Loan, do they ever renegotiate for a lower pay off? For my credit card debt through US Bank, should I pay in full? Or should I work with the bank or a lawyer to have it renegotiated for a lower payoff?

As neither of us have ever lived in Louisville, we intend on renting for a short period of time while we explore housing options in town. We are hoping to set aside $50-60,000 for a down payment on a house, so that we can minimize our mortgage payments. 

Ideally, after debt repayment and house down payment, we would like to set aside between $10-15,000 for savings/investing. Best way to do this?

As for employment, I will be staying with my current employer at an annual salary of approx $60,000. She will be seeking new employment in Louisville, but expects to make around $20,000 a year.

personalfinance,Rolling old pension to IRA and starting new pension. How's my plan?,"I start work for a state government in a few month, and they require participation in the state’s pension fund.  It takes 7% of my pre-tax salary up-front and pays out in some sort of voodoo math that hurts my tiny little mind to figure out.  All I know is that combined we’ll make around $88k in a moderately high-priced city (not NYC but not Nowhere, USA either).

My SO and I are both leaving positions that had a pension, and we plan to roll our contributions - a measly $4k - into a traditional IRA.  I’ve decided I’d rather put that money into a traditional IRA rather than a Roth IRA because we have thousands in credit card debt.  I’d rather pay off the debt now and pay taxes when I retire instead of paying taxes now and having more credit card interest to pay each month.  I think we’ll put it into a joint IRA account with Vanguard at the Target Retirement 2050 fund (we’re both 30). 
 
Speaking of debt, I read a Mr. Money Mustache article about how we should “treat all debt like an emergency.”  So my current plan is this:

*We will not make any contributions to the IRA after the rollover until we completely erase our credit card debt.*  

We were both paycheck-to-paycheck before, but this move gives us both a nice raise.  Hopefully that means our debt will be crushed quickly (I’m looking into getting YNAB to make sure we crush it fast).  If we make IRA contributions when we could be paying down debt, we’re going to add to our interest rate payments, which I absolutely hate.

**With all that in mind, I have a few questions.**

**1. How’s my old-pension-to-IRA plan sound?**

**2. I know this subreddit generally has a “MAX OUT ALL THE ACCOUNTS!” retirement mentality, but don't you think we should wait on IRA contributions until we pay off the credit card debt?**

My Wife is 26 and a public-school art teacher and has all her student loans paid off, I have 15k in student loans but have a federal job, with a student loan repayment service(part of their retention program). I make 54k(raise to 65k this coming sept, and 78k the following sept) and my wife makes 50k. We have a 2009 &amp; 2008 Honda Fit &amp; Toyota Yaris, bought out-right. We are living at my parents house with minimal rent.

**Expenses:**
We are very frugal, and are good about living below our means. 

* Dental Ins.: $890/year
* Health Ins.: $3000/year
* Phone: $840/year
* Car Ins.: $1041/year
* Monthly Allowance(includes gas): $900/month
* Unforseen, random Expenses: $100/week

Both my Wife and I's families are not that well off, so we give them a monthly check to help out.

* My Family(rent): $500/month
* Her Family: $400/month
* Church Tithe: $300/month


* *Total Expenses a year:* **$36,172**


**Savings:**

* Bank: $35,789
* Stocks: $11,374
* Roth IRA: $10,600

* *Total:* **$57,744**

**Retirement**

* IRA &amp; TSP: $8,175


We are currently saving about **$2,850 a month**. This along with 5%(w/5% match) going to my TSP, and $200/(2weeks) going to my Wife's IRA. This savings will increase once I get my scheduled raise in September.

**My Plan &amp; Questions**
It has always been my goal to buy a house out-right by the time I was 25, my Wife supports this, and yes I do know mortgages are at an all time low, and yes I have heard of the Time-Value-of-Money. I just have an irrational disliking of debt. However I have been doing a lot of research about investment properties, listening to bigger pockets podcast and the like. And my goals are starting to change, I still would like to buy a house by 25, but maybe not outright. We feel we would like to own a starter two family home first, from there we'll get some experience in real estate, and being a landlord, and see how that goes. If we like it I figure we'll just withdraw our principal from the Roth, and invest in more properties. If we decide, real-estate is not for us, I'll just keep it in the Roth. Our current plan is to buy our first house in about 1.5 years.

* I am planning to invest $5,500, for 2014 for the ROTH-IRA, and my wife can invest $11,000 for both 2013 &amp; 2014. Any reason I shouldn't do this?

* What do you think of using the Roth as a liquid Capital account?

* What funds would you suggest I buy with the Roth, if I am using it for this purpose?

* My Stocks are all long term stocks, I initially purchased my portfolio by $7,000. It is now worth $11,300. That is a very large gain… I want to try to avoid paying capital gains on it all if I can.

Bitcoin,IRS Law Change Needed,"It's pretty clear the IRS felt they were working within existing laws when providing their recent virtual currency guidance (http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf): 

&gt;In some environments, it operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper 
money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, 
circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the 
country of issuance -- but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. 

&gt;Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes

I'm not sure what the specific request should be from US lawmakers, but I think a debate and law change needs to happen for this to get handled properly. The problem is that there's no clarity on Bitcoin yet. The IRS said it's not US legal tender but it's also not foreign currency, so therefore it's not currency and must be considered as any other property. There must be a new middle ground.

Let's ask lawmakers to update the law to reflect a world with Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency,1396043269
personalfinance,I can pay off one card or pay a little on three...,"I have three credit cards. Each card has a $1500 credit limit and the same interest rate. All three are maxed out. I am expecting to have an extra $1500 to put towards this debt. Would it be better for my credit to pay off one card completely and just the minimum on the other two (and carry a larger balance on them) or pay $500 to each of them equally? I am new to the credit card game and am not sure which route to take. Normally I pay the balances in full each month but we have hit a hard patch and have been relying on the cards to keep us afloat until business gets better. Thanks for any guidance you can give!

personalfinance,How best to handle taxes owed for 2013.,"Let me give you a little back ground on my situation. My wife and I currently owe around $2600 total in state and federal income taxes. My CPA and I completed my 2013 return and have yet to file. I was only really able to take the standard deduction for married filing jointly. We rent our house and have no student loan debt, so no deductions there. My wife and I fully funded Roth IRA's for 2013 with vanguard. I spoke with Vanguard and have to option to categorize these contributions as traditional IRA contributions. So, we now get to the point of my question. Is there any benefit to lowering my taxable income by re-categorize my IRA contributions for 2013, which would reduce my tax bill to pretty much zero, and invest only in a traditional IRA until we buy a house? Or would it be a zero sum gain in the long run since I would be paying the taxes owed in retirement anyway.  Also note that paying the taxes is not the issue I have the money to do so, I would just like insight into anything that I may be missing.",finance,1396054497

personalfinance,Just got my first job! Now student loans must go.,"Hi all. I just recieved a job offer for a position making $55,000 a year with a 3k sign on bonus. I currently have 36,000 in student loan debt, all federal, and about $5000 my mom has in a parent plus loan. I have no credit card of other outstanding debts and I own my 95 Honda Accord.

I would like to kill the debt as fast as possible. Rent in the area will run me $1400/mnth with utilities and internet, and my cell is 45. I have approximately $2200 cash in a savings account, and $1100 in my checking as well as making another $800 from my student jobs. My lease is all paid up for the year as well.

I have six months from June to kill approximately $9000 in unsub (6.8%) and $2000 (3.8%) before the subsidized (3.4%) starts gaining interest.

How should I go about attacking this debt? After my bills are paid, with that salary I'd have approximately $1500 left over. I will begin $2200/yr in a 401k with a $ for $ match as well.

My initial Instinct is to pay $1000 toward the loans and continue living frugally for a few years, but a part of me wants to pay $500 (200 over minimum) and enjoy the spare cash to purchase a car without 165k miles and on hobbies. Thoughts?",finance,1396059990

Bitcoin,"Discussion Topic: Suppose the US government were to launch its own cryptocurrency called ""BitDollar."" Is this a win for cryptocurrencies, or a slap in the face to the unregulated ideals of Bitcoin?","BitDollar would work exactly the same as Bitcoin, except that the Federal Reserve has the ability to introduce as many new BitDollars as it deems necessary, possibly by having access to a bottomless wallet (similar to the way that it's able to print paper money today).

Assume that the value of one BitDollar is locked at $1, so the Fed can either print $100 in paper, or release 100 BitDollars. The rate of inflation would stay the same. 

Assume there are no plans to phase out paper money, but the supply of paper money might diminish as the country begins using BitDollars.

BitDollar miners would be allowed to exist, and the Fed would need to adjust the rate it ""prints"" money to account for the amount of BitDollars mined by independent miners.

Some other things to consider:

* One of the hurdles with using Bitcoin in the United States is that it's difficult to get into the Bitcoin economy. You either need to know someone personally who is willing to sell you Bitcoin (unlikely), live near a Bitcoin ATM (unlikely), or sign up with one of the online exchanges (time consuming and somewhat risky). Do you think BitDollars would be easier to get your hands on?

* How do you think the value of Bitcoin would change as a result of BitDollar? Would it increase as people begin to trust cryptocurrencies, or would it drop as people switch over to BitDollar?

* How would the US government try to leverage this new technology for its own gain? Perhaps a transaction tax?",cryptocurrency,1396101606

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=546338.0


If you haven't heard yet, Auroracoin has forked badly and appears to be crashing under a 51% attack. The above thread on the BTC forum will tell you that, along with something I find rather disgusting. The whole thread reaks of arrogance and, frankly, laughter at the failure of a coin that was, however underplanned, a nice concept and apparently an honest attempt at helping out a hard hit economy.

But neither the intentions of the AUR founder, the realism of his endeavour nor the technical details are what I'm here to talk about; it's the reactions in the cryptocommunity, and how greatly they differ. Sure, the Bitcointalk thread does have people showing sympathy, but at the same time, it's full of voices either spitting scornful laughter or claiming they'd have loved to break the coin themselves. ""Another weak copycoin down"", the discussion goes. Contest between cryptos is natural and fine, but this isn't contest. It's a notion that flat out strangling any and all smaller contestants is good and fair, and it's showing contempt for people trying to build a cryptoeconomy of their own. People who decided to trust the AUR founder despite the numerous rumours that the coin was a scam. Somebody taking that decision does not deserve to be hit while they're already lying down.

But enough of the negativity, because /r/dogecoin is here to the rescue. What little discussion of the AUR fork I've seen here doesn't have this venomous air. You shibes are critizising the bitcoiners stomping on a wounded altcoin rather than laughing at a potential competitor that's out of its luck. 
And I'm damn well proud to be a part of this mentality. If somebody falls, we don't start biting them like a bunch of rabid wolves; we comfort them, chase away those wolves and help them back up. We rebuilt Fedoracoin, and if anybody can do something to save the Aurora users, it's us.

I just need to move forward, and stop making all the same mistakes.

I've been running from it all for so long and I've never made an attempt to keep track of it.  I do know it's a lot.  My credit score is a 504(!).  It's bad.

I'm trying to find information about my options.  Bankruptcy?  Debt consolidation?  How do I know what's a scam and what's a good idea?  This is my money, and in today's world, that's pretty much my whole future.  I don't want to screw it up worse than I already have.

He has said things like he would disband the fed, get rid of the minimum wage, privatize education, get rid of the CIA and FBI and withdraw the US from the UN if he could. It seems to me like he wants America to return to the laissez-faire period of the late 1800s and early 1900s where people like Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, and Morgan made huge fortunes while their workers were paid next to nothing and there was no regulation in anything like Upton Sinclair illustrated in The Jungle. We have moved past that time period as a country because we realized how serious the flaws were so I honestly feel like Ron and his supporters are delaying the progress of America.

investing,How should I invest for down payment in 3 years,"I've never invested in my life. I set a goal to purchase a home in 3 years, but I would like some advice on how to set aside some extra cash for a down payment. Here is my situation:

Every 6 months, I can dump another $8k into my portfolio thanks to my employer's ESPP.
Doing some quick math, that means I'd have $71k in 3 years if I let it sit in my savings account (plus a few bucks from their pathetic interest rate)

My question is, how should I invest for the next 3 years if I plan to liquidate the portfolio for a down payment? What online broker should I go with? (I have e*trade for ESPP, but is it any good?)

personalfinance,Truck quandary - need advice,"Hi PF, this is a throwaway for soon to be obvious reasons...

I got myself in sticky situation related to personal finance and I'm hoping for some advice.

In 2013 I got a loan for a truck around $30k. About 2 months after I got the truck, my child's mother (who I pay child support to) stopped helping me out with finances (my monthly payment to her is about $900). When she was helping me out, I could make the truck payments no problem. For the last year I have been struggling to make the payments and keep myself fed/pay rent.

In January my auto insurance lapsed. While it was lapsed I got into an accident in my truck.  No one was injured and there was no damage to anyone's property (I slid into a ice/snow bank).

The front of the truck is smashed up pretty good. I'd estimate getting the truck fixed will cost about $3-4k.

My plan originally was to get insurance when I could afford it, claim that the accident happened while I was insured (fraud) and move on with my life.

I now see that the exposed metal from the crash has rusted over the last 3 months. There is no way anyone is going to believe the accident occurred recently.

I don't know when I'll ever have the money to fix the truck, if ever... Perhaps my 2015 tax return? I still owe around $26k on the truck.

What do I do?

The options I've considered are:

- Stop paying for the truck, let them come repo it, take the major hit on finances and credit?

- Attempt the insurance fraud anyway? Claim the accident happened more recently than it did? Likely go to jail?

- Try to sell the truck? I'd take a major loss. Who would buy a truck with a smashed front end?

- Flee the country?

I realize how hosed I am here, just wanted to get some opinions on what my best move would be?

I currently have some student loans from my undergraduate degree, but my Master's will be fully funded. I will get about $400 every two weeks for income after taxes. While receiving funding, I am not allowed to have another job during graduate school.

Until January, I will be living with my partner in the city he has found a job (500+ miles away from our current location). He will be working full-time as a engineer making $22.00 per hour (with a high possibilities of bonuses and overtime). He currently has some student loan debt (exact amount unavailable, roughly ~$40k), but no other liabilities or assets either. We have not yet found a house/apartment to rent in this city yet, so expenses are still up in the air. 

***My Information***

Current FICO Credit Score: 644

Current Student Loans and Interest Rates: [here](http://imgur.com/cVZSlZS)

Credit Cards: None

Car Loans: None

Other Loans/Liabilities: None, besides a few manageable medical bills

***Monthly Expenses while at University***

Cell Phone: $80 (currently locked into a contract until Summer 2015)

Utilities: $120 per month

Food and other expenses: $200 per month

I know that our very first step after moving will be to start an emergency fund. Other expenses that we are looking at coming up are student loan payments for a few months (my payments begin in June), a car for me since I don't have one, and possibly a newer car for my partner since his is getting expensive to keep repairing.

personalfinance,"25m - Paying Student Loans, Saving for House, and Building Credit","Hello everyone, I've been researching around /r/personalfinance for a bit and thought you wise folks could offer me some advice.


My goal is to buy a house (my first) within the next two years. I'm thinking of something around $150k. I think an appropriate amount to have saved for a down payment and closing costs would be $24k (please correct me if this seems wrong). So, my goal would be to save $1k/mo.



The situation:


*$2700/mo take home pay


*$1700/mo expenses (erring on the high side for all costs)


*Have a 5 month emergency fund ($8600) built


*Contributing to 401k (9% with full employer match)


*$4500 student loan debt at 4.25% interest rate, paid ahead til 2018


*No other debts but no credit history really (score is 686)


My plan was to fully pay off my student loan when I receive my paycheck in the next couple days. I have applied for and was approved for a credit card, though I have not received anything yet and do not know what the limit is yet (I did this simply to help my credit score, I have no intention of ever paying interest with this card). 


I know that saving $1k/mo seems ambitious (err... mathematically impossible...) given the numbers I posted, but the expenses are a rough number and I've been paying $750/mo of student loans off for a while. If it squeezes too much I can attempt to cut expenses and cut back the saving if ultimately necessary. 



So my questions for you fine folks are:


*Does $24k saved for a down payment and closing costs on a $150k house seem sane? 


*Thoughts on paying off the student loan (eg: use your card in several payments in short succession, don't pay it all off at once because the interest rate is low, etc.) 


*Any sort of savings account or investment you can recommend for the home savings? 


*Does this all seem sane and healthy to you?

personalfinance,What are the consequences of not paying your mortgage and going into foreclosure?,"I xposted in /r/personalfinance and /r/legaladvice/  Sorry if I broke reddit's rules

I live in Maine

So, my wife and I are getting divorced.  She moved out a year ago and I have been paying 100% of the mortgage ever since.  Her name is on the mortgage, too.  We were working on the relationship for a while but things are not going well and she is filing.  We meet with a mediator next week.  We are very friendly and maintain a good relationship despite the divorce.  So I would not do this out of spite.

I can maintain the mortgage but I'm living paycheck to paycheck.  Now my old car is ready to die (rusted out frame) and I cannot afford to replace it.  I have no cash but I do have about $6000 in assets that I can liquidate (4-wheeler, snowmobile, etc).  I also have $50k in a 401k and $17k in a college fund for my son that I'd rather not touch but will if I have to.  My wife will probably get half of everything.  I will also probably have to pay alimony and child support (we will each have our son 50% of the time) because I make 2x her pay.  

I have no other debt.  I have a credit card I use every day and pay it off 100% every month.  I have two other credit cards I do not use; both have $20k limits.  I don't know the interest rates of any of them because I never have a balance.  As a result my credit score is 805.  My wife owes about $12k in credit card debt in her name only.  She cannot afford the apartment she lives in and racks up more credit card debt every month to pay the bills.  I think that means I am not liable for any of it.

We bought the house in 2007 (height of the bubble) for $240k.  We now owe $196k.  The mortgage payment is $1700 per month.  I have not called a realtor or home assessor.  I would need to put about $3000 in repairs before I sell.  That's if I do the work myself.  It would be much higher if I have to pay someone.  I have no idea what the current market value of the house is but I don't think I can sell it for what I owe.

So, what happens if I stop paying the mortgage, stay in the house until evicted, and stockpile that cash instead?  How long before I am evicted?  If I finance a car and go into foreclosure can they seize the car?  I told my wife I am thinking of this and she is worried about her credit score.  I keep thinking (I said no spite..)  she hasn't paid a penny on the mortgage for a year and now I'm a bad guy because I don't want to, too?

I know I should probably try to sell but honestly I have no energy or motivation.  I just want out.  So I asked my wife to invest the time and money into selling.  She is unwilling as well.  Also, I honestly don't care about my credit right now.  Credit is only good if you can finance something.  I cannot finance anything if I continue to stay in the house.  I feel I need cash right now, not credit.

Please, just assume that I will not sell and I will stop paying the mortgage.  I want to know what the consequences are.  Thanks!

Tldr; I cannot afford my mortgage and a car.   The house is upside down   I need a car today. I have no cash.   Please assume my only option is to go into foreclosure.  What happens if I finance a car, stop paying the mortgage, and start stockpiling cash instead?",finance,1396188769

The introduction of Riley was a huge ""look at our new toy"" moment that seemed to not deliver what we wanted. You rarely use him as when you want to you are afraid he will get shot. The few times you see him he's aesthetically pleasing but now what we wanted I guess. The lack of depth that came from the campaign left a dry, lifeless campaign that I didn't enjoy. The brothers didn't have enough of a back-story for me to feel a secs of caring as they proceeds in their ""nearly impossible"" missions, which on hardened, the standard I play on, was a cake walk. Moving from cover to cover allowed you to absolutely slap the federation with the back of your hand. So the campaign left a dry, lifeless story to me.

But none of you care for the campaign. Time for the real fun. MULTIPLAYER! WOOOOO!

I returned this game.

Going off of my previous statement, this is the first game I have EVER, EVER brought back to GameStop. Ever. The multiplayer made me wanna throw in cod 4 to revive my love for the series. Ghosts multiplayer is so one sides and hard to play that I went from a ~1.3 (give or take a tenth) to a 0.82. Now I can't tell if it is me being either A) bad. Or B) the games structure. Along with many of my friends who have had te same problem, dropping from a 2.1 (BO2) to a 1.6 (GHO) my buddy Andy was absolutely unstoppable in BO2, then dropped to a little above good in ghosts. The maps ""Levelution"" is a complete joke. From moving a dumpster in an area I've never seen a gunfight in, to moving piles of logs in an area you will never see ANYONE IN GENERAL. The game seriously lacks it's pearlessace that we were promised. And what happened to that spotting system? Am I wrong? Wasn't there support to be a BattleFeild style spotting system? I may be wrong on that. But I digress further into this ""unforgettable title"". Now in fairness, the game did have to live up to some serious competition, BO2, MW3 killed it in sales an were very fun games. Ghosts has had to compete with BF4, which I later bought and love. But the game is missing that full feeling. The small things also got to me. All the guns sounding the same, the new sniping thing with the periphial vision sucked, the killstreaks were kinda awful. It may just be the fact that I wasn't very good also. Map structure was broken and one sided. Take the one map with the freight trains and freight that split the map down the middle. If you spawn in on the side with the orange building with the ladder that goes up to the top floor to the sniper spot, you won. Hands down, you won. And it would be a blow-out. Or the map with the earthquakes, spawn in on the gas station? You got massacred to no extent. WEAPONS- don't get me started. The weapons are basicly all exact copies of the honey badger minus the silencer and with added fire rates. The DMR's or Marksmen Rifles are a complete joke, either requiring 3-5 shots, or, being an instant kill. The sniping is done well I must say outiside of the weird blurry view. The SMG's are horrible unpowerful and the shotguns are the rule of the roost, the bulldog cannot be stopped. The game attempts to make up in lack of multiplayer in customization or the squads. I F**KING HATE THIS SYSTEM!! Let me play as one character!!! Please!! This whole system of squad points and unlocking is almost a copy of black ops 1 and the cod-money-points thing that flopped. Who in the dev-room looked at this idea and went ""this is good. This is gonna be game changing!!"" That person should be fired immediately! Why the hell would I ever want to use more than one person! All people do is just play as the first guy and give home classes that cover whatever their play-style is. Nothing I hate more in that game that that system.

Extinction- finally something worth talking about.

Extinction to me made the game go from a 3/10 to a 5. Extinction was a very well done minigame. It was challenging, but not impossible, I beat it with a few friends after our 5th or 6th play. The story couldn't mean less but all we wanted to do was play that bomb and run. The fights were a team-based struggle where you needed to work as a squad to revive, or move in a wave, or resupy people. It was done quite well.



---Overall---

Come on Infinity Ward. You're better than this. You guys have us MW1,2 and 3! But this? This is an atrocity! I love you guys as developers, but come on! Your game has more returns than any other game in history! (Fact check that, I'm not sure of its true, heard that on a review) Your game disappointed me and so many others. Cod ghosts has it's glimpses of triumph here and there but they are so far and few that it makes a lazy, boring game.


So if it seemed rantish I wouldn't blame you. This game failed in my eyes. I've been playing BF4 and that has been very fun. 


Overall score. 4.5/10, would not buy.

personalfinance,Researching into a Money Market account,"From what I understand a money market account (MMA) is sort of like a savings with a higher interest rate, bit with more restrictions concerning amount of allowable withdrawals and minimum balance.

I can only assume that the APY is higher for an MMA and the restrictions are greater is to ensure the bank that they will have a certain amount of your money available to them, and in return you are rewarded with a slightly higher APY.

personalfinance,We've been working on our debt for years but can't seem to make any headway. Considering debt consolidation and looking for other helpful tips.,"For the last few years my wife and I have been working to try and pay down our debts and get our head above water. Our main focus is our nearly $17,000 combined credit card debt. To keep a sob story very short, we went through a bit of a tough time in 2010 when I lost my job and in 2011 when we had to try and sell our home after I had found work out of state, which ended up going into foreclosure. My wife has worked very hard on our budget but it's still a huge frustration in our lives and we can't seem to make any headway on it. 

After reading through different posts on here on personalfinance, there seem to be a multitude of different suggestions, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what would potentially best fit our given situation.

**The first idea that comes to mind is Debt Consolidation**. From what I've read this is basically a numbers game trying to determine if the Interest Rate and Payments would truly be better than just being diligent and doing it yourself. I've also heard some horror stories of disreputable consolidation schemes that never actually pay back your debts. Outside of that, I'm totally unaware of any additional tricks or hidden fees that might be associated. It's an attractive option though, since it would seemingly allow us to establish the long term goal (we'll have our debt paid off by this date) while consolidating the number of payments and payments schedules we have to balance. Not sure if it would make sense given our financials below.  

I've also seen a few suggestions of just not paying your cards and effectively filing chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy. Call it personal pride, but this is totally not something I'd ever want to consider. It also seems way too good to be true and I'm not sure what sort of legal ramifications there would be after the fact given that even with our debts, my wife and I are certainly not destitute and can afford to continue making payments on our debts. It just very much feels like we'd be taking advantage of the situation. 

Outside of that we're looking for any suggestions that anyone feels may help us. Like I said, my wife has been working with our budget and has it pretty much down to the last penny, but it doesn't allow us to be very flexible when certain ""out of the blue"" expenses pop up. We end up having to readjust the budget pretty much every month to make up for these things, which I see as a major contributing factor to why we still haven't made much headway on our debts. 

We're currently going with the ""avalanche"" method, trying to completely pay off our credit card with the current highest interest rate and then kill it. I'm sort of on the opinion that we should just outright cancel all of our credit cards in order to make sure we're not putting anything back on them, but that leaves us in a very precarious position in case something should arise. I imagine the real answer here is to work on setting up an emergency fund on the side that only sits there in case something comes up (so we don't put anything back on a credit card) but I'm having a hard time balancing that decision against putting every dime we can toward our credit card balances.

For reference, our current credit break down is as follows:

Credit Card 1: Purchase APR: 11.99% current min payment 105.55 current balance: 5526.00
Credit Card 2: Purchase APR: 11.24% current min payment: 97.00 current balance: 4887.00
Credit Card 3: Purchase APR: 9.24% current min payment: 121.00 current balance: 6908.00


**Edit:** We've talked about pulling money out of my IRA to pay down our debt, but it doesn't seem to make ANY sense given the compounding effects it would have on our retirement. I currently have a ""static"" IRA (nothing being contributed into it, only managing invested funds) along with a work based 401k that is being invested into along with matching by my employer. Not sure if it makes sense to take the IRA funds (about 10k) and put those towards the debt given the fact it's not being invested into.

personalfinance,"Will have $35,000 as of January 1. I have a few ideas, what is wisest?","So my husband has about $20,000 in inheritance coming to him in January, 2015. I have about $15,000 in inheritance stashed away. Additionally, we have about $5,000 in savings of our own, and expect to have at least another $5,000 by then. We estimate a total of about $45,000 at our disposal. 

I am trying to decide what exactly to do with this money. A few things:

Our annual income isn't huge; our take-home pay is about $2,800/month because I'm currently unemployed (we're moving to a new city and I had to quit my job). I expect to be employed again soon but I will leave that income out of consideration. We currently break even with my husband's income alone.

I have about $27,000 in student loan debt. I am paying $500/month on it. According to my servicer, I'll pay this off in 6.5 years at my current repayment rate. My husband has a $500/month car payment for about 2 more years. His credit is flawless, mine is on the low end of fair (maybe because of my huge loans? Not sure why)

I see 2 real possibilities, maybe an odd 3rd one too:

1. Pay off all debts, student loan and most of the truck. Save what we can going forward to hopefully get a down payment on a house someday in the next 6 or so years.

2. Try to put most of that money toward a down payment on a house now while interest rates are good.

3. Buy a house at auction. We figure that property taxes, insurances and utilities would cost us about half of what we currently spend in rent.


Personally, we like Option 3. Our city has hugely high rents. If we owned a house outright, we could start putting a TON of money toward my student loans. Without rent, I'd say we can take half of what we were paying on rent and put it toward student loans, and cut my payoff time to about 3 years. We'd only be comfortable with this with the help of a lawyer to ensure no lien/debt nightmares on the property. Then we also wouldn't have to pay off debts just for the joy of taking out a 10-year bigger debt.

BUT something about option 3 suggests ""too good to be true"" and I fear we're simply not thinking about the drawbacks clearly enough.

Could someone give me some advice?

personalfinance,30 yr vs 15 yr conventional mortgage,"1st time homebuyer.

If I can easily afford payments on a 15 yr mortgage for a new home, is this a no brainer over a 30 yr mortgage?  I would build equity sooner and I would still have room for investments on the side

personalfinance,27 and I feel like I don't have enough time. Advice needed.,"Hi r/personalfinance. I'll try to keep this post as brief as possible, but I really need some advice on what to do. I'll list out my figures and then ask my question.

Debt: 

Student loans: $117k (mix of federal subsidized and unsubsidized)
Credit cards: $600
Car loan: $700 ($93.56 per month)

Bills:

Rent: $530 (my husband pays the other $300)
Internet/Local Channels: $75
Heat/Electric: Average $120
Gas: $160 
Groceries/Eating out: According to my mint, I average around $389 per month in this category.

Bank balances:

$6900 in my primary checking
$879 in my joint checking (used to pay rent and cable)
$2400 in savings

Income:

After taxes and a 2% 401k contribution (that's not matched because my company sucks), I am taking home around $2400 per month. I just got a promotion so that should go up to about $2600 per month with quarterly bonuses of $2000.

Other information:

My student loans are in deferment as I've been taking two community college classes per semester, but I'm tired of staying in school. I filed for an IBR (not eligible for the pay-as-you-go plans), but I've yet to hear back what my monthly amount would be. My husband's income is about $1500 per month and he takes care of his credit card debt, our car insurance, and our cell phone plan.  His student loans are also in deferment for the time-being. However, his situation is far more dire. He lives paycheck to paycheck and my savings effectively acts as a safety net for the both of us.

Job-wise, we're both in the IT field, but he's just starting and I've only been in the field for about two years. I feel like I can't stay at a job for longer than six-months to a year because of my student loan debt and it's starting to freak me out.  I'm just not sure what to do anymore.  

TL;DR: I start a new job tomorrow that makes $41k base with $8k in quarterly bonuses, but I have $117k in student loan debt that's in deferment.

I'm at a crossroad and don't know where I should go. A quick synopsis. I have $62k in student loans left. All private and at 3% interest. Minimum payment is $375/mo. I just finished paying off all of my federal loans with higher rates. I have no other debt to speak of. I have $10k in the bank and an additional $35k ""emergency fund."" My 401k is doing quite well and is around $120k invested semi-aggressively.

I currently make ~$150k/yr with monthly living expenses around $3k,, not including fun money. I would say I spend between $500-1000 per month on recreation. Mostly on the low end of that.

Now that I'm at this point I don't know what to do. I hate being owned. I hate being in debt. It's a realistic possibility that I could be debt free in 12 months if I set my mind to it. The other side is I could probably invest and make a better return on the money than I pay in interest.

I've decided to make some changes in my career that will result in me making about $100-120k/yr so i'm trying to figure out if I should get rid of the debt, or invest the money and have that to fall back on.

Any advice is appreciated.

EDIT: Budget is as follows: Rent $1875, Electric: $100, Groceries: $500, Gas: $200, Car ins: $120, $200 set aside each month for annual/biannual professional licensure fees and memberships. Most of my free time is spent running, biking, swimming, or camping so I don't spend much. Most of my friends are pretty thrifty too so there isn't much temptation.

Also, it should be mentioned that the pay cut is not mandatory or urgent. I've just reached a point in my current job where I want more and it's apparent I won't get it there. I might find something that is complementary and keep the original job, or I might quit and find a whole new gig. Either way, the job is secure as long as I want it. I'm outperforming every measure.

I'm very nervous about having a 95% allocation towards stocks, and I'd like to diversify into *something*, but bonds have terrible yields, and will probably drop further when interest rates rise.  Nothing else really looks all that promising.  I've been looking for alternatives, and I ran into two private placements at a local real estate conference.  While we qualify to be accredited investors, the extent of our investment experience has been buying Vanguard funds, and I feel very nervous and under-educated.

I'd like to know what the community thinks of private placements in general, and maybe two offerings in particular:

MMG Capital Tax Lien fund
http://www.mmginvestors.com/available-investment-programs/211-new-opportunity-real-estate-tax-liens-12-return.html
The basic idea is that MMG Capital buys tax lien debt from counties and collects on it, the homes being collateral for the debt.  The fund has a preferred return of 12% to investors.  What this means is that the investor gets the first 12% of any profit, and MMG keeps everything over 12%.  The debt having collataral makes it seem like this would be fairly safe.  As in, maybe there's a risk MMG doesn't find tax liens to buy, but there doesn't seem to be any substantial risk that MMG doesn't get paid for a tax lien they've already purchased.

 GCA California Real Estate Fund
http://www.gcaequitypartners.com/
The basic idea is that GCA provides loans to ""fix-and-flip"" investors who will purchase undervalued homes that have upside potential, spend 2-12 months renovating, and then re-sell the homes.  GCA does not own the homes, only the loan.  However, the loans they give are ""hybrid"", in the sense that GCA also gets a cut of any price appreciation.  They are offering an 8% preferred return, plus a 30/70 split of profit after the first 8%.

I don't think these offerings are risk-free, but I'm hoping that their risk would at least not be highly correlated to stock market returns, which is really what I'm looking for in diversification.  I'm also very afraid of being taken in by con men. 

Some big questions I have:

Is there counter-party risk?  Could MMG Capital or GCA just disappear tomorrow with my cash?

The government evidently thinks these investments are risky enough to keep non-accredited investors away?  Should that worry me?

Step 3:

In both Master and slave run

After Installation get completed. check whether java is installed properly by running

```
 $java $javac
```
To check JAVA version run

```
 $java -version
```
We have java-1.6.0\_30 installed. Prefer java 1.6.0 version always.

Step 4:

Create a ssh key in master To create key run

```
 $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P """"
```
[](http://ift.tt/1jqaoLj)

Step 5:

In master make a copy of the key generated and place it into /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized\_keys

To do this run

```
 $cat /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Step 6:

In master test whether we can ssh to our own machine.

To test run

```
 $ssh localhost
```
[](http://ift.tt/1fF776r)

Step 7:

In master to come out of the connected machine press ctrl+d It will show as logout and Connection to localhost closed as shown in the image below

[](http://ift.tt/1jqanHv)

Step 8:

open a new tab in terminal in your local machine.

send the key of your amazon ec2(The pem file which you have download from [amazon](http://ift.tt/1dpdXiv)) to your master machine.

To do this run this command in local machine

```
 scp -i ~/path/to/key.pem /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@[publicDNSofmastermachine]:~
```
The above command will copy the the key from your local machine to ec2 machine.

[](http://ift.tt/1fF78XL)

To check whether the file has been copied to master run $ls in master in your given path.

Step 9:

Add the key to ssh-agent

To check whether ssh-agent is running or not run

```
 $pgrep -fl ssh-agent
```
If no output, Then it means it is not running. To make it run

Run this command

```
 $eval `ssh-agent -s`
```
Then check with run

```
 $pgrep -f1 ssh-agent
```
Step 10:

Now add your key to the ssh-agent. To do this run

```
 $ssh-add ~/key.pem
```
Step 11:

Now send the ssh key generated in master to slave by rsync([http://rsync.samba.org/](http://rsync.samba.org/)) so that they can communicate.

To do this run

```
 $rsync -avL --progress ~/.ssh ec2-user@[public-DNS_of_slave]:~
```
[](http://ift.tt/1fF78XN)

Step 12:

In Both Master and slave update hosts file.

To do this, run

```
 $hostname
```
You will get something like this ip-172-0-0-1,then run

```
 $vi /etc/hosts
```
Enter the ip address of both master and slave in the format shown below

```
 172.0.0.1 master 172.0.1.2 slave
```
Save it and come out the vi editor.

If there are more slaves than one then add the ip address of slaves as shown below

```
 172.0.0.1 master 172.0.1.2 slave 172.0.1.4 slave2
```
and so on

Step 13:

To check whether it is working properly run

```
 $ssh master
```
It will connect to master machine

To come out press ctrl+d,then run

```
 $ssh slave
```
It will connect to slave machine

To come out press ctrl+d

Step 14:

In master download Hadoop 2.2.0 by running following command

```
 $wget http://ift.tt/1jqaoLz; Once downloaded untar it by running
```
$tar xvfz hadoop-2.2.0.tar.gz
```
Step 15:

Set the permission to the hadoop-2.2.0 folder by running

```
 $sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user hadoop-2.2.0
```
Step 16:

In both master and slave

We have to set JAVA\_HOME and HADOOP\_HOME in bashrc file.

To do this open bashrc file by running

```
 vi ~/.bashrc
```
Update bashrc file with

```
 export HADOOP_HOME=/path/to/hadoop-2.2.0 export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0.x86_64 export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```
[](http://ift.tt/1fF77mP)

Step 17:

In both master and slave run

```
 $source ~/.bashrc
```
This will make bashrc file has the source.

Step 18:

In master update JAVA\_HOME in home/ec2-user/hadoop-2.2.0/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh

```
 JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0.x86_64
```
[](http://ift.tt/1fF77mT)

Step 19:

In both master and slave Run

```
 $cd //To come to home
```
Now create are creating directory so that hadoop will store its data files, network ports, etc here.

To do this run

```
 $ sudo mkdir -p /app/hadoop/tmp $ sudo chown hduser:hadoop /app/hadoop/tmp $ sudo chmod 750 /app/hadoop/tmp
```
If you forget to set the required ownerships and permissions, you will see a java.io.IOException when you try to format the name node in the next section).

Step 20:

In master

```
 update /etc/hadoop/core-site.xml, /etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml, /etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml
```
Run

```
 $vi hadoop.2.2.0/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml
```
Add below lines between ….

```
hadoop.tmp.dir/app/hadoop/tmpA base for other temporary directories.fs.default.namehttp://hdfsmaster:54310The name of the default file system. A URI whose scheme and authority determine the FileSystem implementation. The uri's scheme determines the config property (fs.SCHEME.impl) naming the FileSystem implementation class. The uri's authority is used to determine the host, port, etc. for a filesystem.
```
come out of the vi editor. Then Run

```
 $vi hadoop.2.2.0/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml
```
Add below lines between ….

```
mapred.job.trackermaster:54311The host and port that the MapReduce job tracker runs at. If ""local"", then jobs are run in-process as a single map and reduce task.
```
come out of vi editor.Then Run

```
 $vi hadoop.2.2.0/etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml
```
Add below lines between ….

```
dfs.replication2Default block replication. The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created. The default is used if replication is not specified in create time.
```
come out of vi editor

Step 21:

From master we have to copy the hadoop folder to slave machine

To do this run

```
 rsync -avL --progress /home/ec2-user/ ec2-user@[public-DNS_of_slave]:/home/ec2-user/
```
Step 22:

In master now Run the below command to format the namenode of hadoop

```
 $hadoop-2.2.0/bin/hadoop namenode -format
```
Step 23:

once the format is done run (in master)

```
 $hadoop-2.2.0/sbin/Start-all.sh
```
It starts NodeManager, NameNode, Datanode,SecondaryNameNode, ResourceManager in master AND NodeManager in slave

To check this run $jps command in both master abd slave.

Step 24:

Now we shall download and install spark in master and slave In master download spark-0.8.1-incubating-bin-hadoop2

To download this run

```
 $wget http://ift.tt/1fK7VFP
```
Step 25:

Now untar it by running

```
 $tar xvfz spark-0.8.1-incubating-bin-hadoop2.tgz
```
Now add the public DNS of slave in slave file of spark.

To do this run

```
 $vi /home/ec2-user/spark/spark-0.8.1-incubating-bin-hadoop2/conf/slaves
```
Remove localhost present there and add slave public-DNS of slave or give the host name we specified for slave ip in /etc/hosts i.e “slave”.

[](http://ift.tt/1jqaoem)

If in case there are more than one slave add it as follows

```
 slave slave1 slave2
```
and so on

Step 26:

From master sync the spark folder to slave by running

```
 rsync -avL --progress /path/to/spark-0.8.1-incubating-bin-hadoop2/ ec2-user@[public-DNS_of_slave_machine]:/pathto/spark-0.8.1-incubating-bin-hadoop2/
```
Step 27:

From master run

```
 $sudo ./spark/bin/start-all.sh
```
This will start spark services in both master and slave

To check this run $sudo jps command in both master and slave

Step 28:

Run

```
 $./bin/spark-shell
```
This gives you the scala shell.Now you can run some scala code here.

Example: Put a sample file in hdfs as follow

```
 $hadoop fs -put /path/to/README.txt / scala&gt;val textFile = sc.textFile(""hdfs://master:54310/README.md"") scala&gt;textFile.count()
```
This will return you the total number of lines in the file specified in the hdfs path.

To see the web-UI of spark give the following address in browser

```
 [public-DNS_of_master]:8080
```
There you can see the number of workers also

[](http://ift.tt/1jqaoet)

Step 29:

To stop spark service Run

```
 $sudo ./spark/bin/stop-all.sh
```
To stop hadoop service

```
 $hadoop-2.2.0/sbin/Stop-all.sh
```

personalfinance,Questions about down-payments on a home purchase!,"- From a buyer's perspective, why make a down-payment?
    - I tend to think that with today's low interest rates, it may be best to pay a home-loan as slowly as possible so as to allocate that money to investments / stocks / funds that will (at least probably, over the next 30 years) offer a return that's greater than the rate being paid on the mortgage. This would suggest that a buyer should make the smallest down-payment possible.
- Going in another direction, suppose I were buying a 100k property and could make a 40k down payment: Would there be any advantage to a) paying 20k, taking a 80k loan, then immediately paying it down by another 20k, as opposed to b) paying 40k and taking a 60k loan?
    - Would the interest rates that the bank offers differ? Assuming the rates were the same, would the two processes have an impact on the total interest paid?
- Thanks! Oh, and since I'm trying to learn, math and sources help more than straight ""Yes"" or ""No"" statements.",finance,1396275540
personalfinance,An email from my CPA regarding annuities. What do you think?,"*My CPA sent me this email. What do you think?*

Consider the source when it comes to negative press about annuities 


We all know annuities are in the news frequently, sparking debate for a variety of reasons both within our industry and beyond.  If you’re an advisor who works with annuities, you already know it’s inevitable that your clients are going to come across bad press about annuities from time to time.


For myself, I try to proactively manage that reality by explaining where annuities fit in the broader scheme of investment options, and why some of the negative press out there may not be entirely objective.  I explain it this way:


Essentially there are three types of institutions vying for your money.  The first type includes brokerage houses and mutual funds — both basically stock market-based.  The second is insurance companies, and the third, banks.  As long as the Fed keeps interest rates at or near zero, banks are pretty much out of the running at the moment, so that leaves brokerage houses and insurance companies.


Now in terms of the financial press, you have to think about where some of the information you read in it comes from.  The reality is that most articles written in financial publications aren’t written by financial advisors or money experts; they’re contributed by professional writers.


A particular writer might have a resume that includes everything from athlete interviews for Sports Illustrated to travel articles for National Geographic, but this month he’s writing a feature on annuities for a top financial magazine.  Of course, not being an expert, he has to write his story with the aid of a lot of outside research.  He could do basic research on his own, or he could turn to a more convenient source.


Who might be the easiest source to work with?  Well, probably someone who advertises with the magazine.  And just who are those advertisers?  Very often they’re Wall Street firms and mutual funds.  So when the writers calls on of these friendly sources, of course they are more than happy to put their spin on the subject of annuities — a spin that will probably be more favorable to the sale of their products.


In the end, this seems like a great system.  After all, everyone is happy.  The writer is happy because he got his story.  The advertiser is happy because he was quoted and got some extra free publicity.  The publication is happy because the advertiser (a big revenue source) is happy.


But the end result for readers/investors, is, again, a story that may not be as objective as it seems, and may ultimately amount to little more than anti-annuity rhetoric.  In other words, when it comes to any news about annuities, I make sure my clients and prospects understand that it’s important to “consider the source.”",finance,1396275799
Bitcoin,Trustless P2P Prediction Markets,"Previously, I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ycjdi/whitepaper_decentralized_bitcoin_prediction/) about [my Truthcoin project](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin), but it was immediately buried via the MtGox-Apocalypse.

Since that post, I've continued to make a lot of progress, and now consider the design (and the proof-of-concept code for all completely novel elements) to be finished, and await new comments/questions, and/or a development-initiative.

Summary:

USD-based PMs are subject to censorship/removal, and current BTC solutions require trusting a third-party with funds.  All existing solutions require the operator to provide the markets you are interested in and correctly arbitrate those markets. This project aims to eliminate all of these problems.

As before, PMs allow you to do a number of remarkable things (are you tired of hearing that Bitcoin ""has no intrinsic value?""):

1. Use the combined knowledge and intellectual ability of mankind to construct and refine the most accurate possible prediction of the future.
2. End debates about the contentious issues of today, such as climate-change, heritability of IQ, effect of GMOs etc.
3. Prevent anyone (even politicians, industry leaders) from lying about a target claim.
4. Encourage and compensate whistleblowers.
5. Provide ‘market advice’ on the relative impact of decisions on outcomes (“If we adopt X Fed policy, what effect on inflation can we expect?”).
6. Provide insurance (buying and selling) opportunities for catastrophic global disasters, earthquakes, hurricane, etc.
7. Allow tradable binary financial derivatives, for example on the BTC exchange rate, or the solvency of exchanges, or to create replicating portfolios of 'real-world' assets (gold, DJIA, BTC).
8. Recreational gambling in real time, always at actuarially fair odds and low fees.
9. Allows for the creation of ‘Trustless Dominant Assurance Contracts’ which allow financing of public goods such as lighthouse, roads, etc. with no counterparty risk.

personalfinance,"Looking for constructive criticism for my attack plan - a few questions, as well.","I'll try to describe the situation as accurately and quickly as possible, but will summarize expenses at the end. My wife and I are turning 26 this summer.

My salary is $38k, not including overtime or bonus. Her salary is $34k, not including overtime. So, $72k gross yearly. Our take home is around $4490 per month, estimated without overtime.

We both contribute 3% (with a company match to that 3%) to our 401ks. Mine has around $5500 or so in it, hers is newly opened with her company.

I have a Roth IRA with around $390 in it, but a small amount is invested in riskier stock picks with the rest sitting in money market since all the funds have minimums that I can see of $3k+. She is looking to open one.

Not much of savings to speak of, maybe a bit over $1k in our checking account. We feel very secure in our positions and are near the top performers. I do, however, understand the necessity of growing an emergency fund. We have life insurance, short and long term disability insurance, etc.

I have maybe around $1.3k on a credit card. She has probably around $6.9k. These are at typical CC rates.

I have no student loans. She has between $90k and $100k between her undergrad and masters. I believe these loans to be around 6.5%, if memory serves.

I have a ~$13.8k car loan at 2.49% which comes to around $280-285 per month. I have a ~$6.2k personal loan at ~10.5% which is $200 per month.

-----------------

So, **take home $4490 per month**. Including rent, car, personal loan, minimums on student loans, gas, food, insurance, utilities, internet/cable/cell, etc - our **expenses should total around $2931 per month**, or around 50.25% of our gross (65.28% of our net).

This means we have ~$1559 ""left over"".

With how secure we feel in our jobs, I'm tempted to just throw $1200 per month towards the CC debt until that's eliminated and then begin putting away maybe $600 per month in an emergency fund and throw $600 per month extra towards the personal loan, then focusing down the student loans.

**Questions**

- Is the personal loan at a high enough interest rate to make it worth it paying it down over building an emergency fund? In a broader sense... when should an emergency fund be built? Immediately? When you're CC-debt free?

- Are the school loans at a high enough interest rate to, at this point in our lives, focus them down instead of contributing to our Roth IRA at that point?

- My car only has 7800 miles on it and is in Excellent condition - it's worth around $14.6k according to KBB.com. I'd prefer to keep it, but decided to include the information. This isn't really a question one way or the other, just info.

- How much psychology should come into play? The CC debt and personal loan weigh on me a bit heavier and definitely take precedence to pay off over trying to max out IRAs at this point, in my opinion. The student loans I'm a bit more of a toss up on, especially considering that they're not in my name, despite the fact that I'll be helping to pay them off.

Please note I'm not interested in judgmental responses concerning the past - only constructive comments regarding the future.

**EDIT: Thank you for the responses - we will be aggressively paying down credit card debt within the next 6 months, and then do the same with the personal loan. After that, we should be free to throw around $2000 monthly, maybe a little more, towards the loans, which should pay them off pretty quickly. Then we'll be debt-free (the car will be paid off by then) and will be able to max our IRAs and put a lot more towards our 401ks going forward. I think I was putting more weight into the next few years than was necessary. Sure, starting to contribute the IRA max now would be awesome... but not at the expense of all this debt. If we start in a few more years, it won't be the worst thing. And it will feel a lot better being debt free.**",finance,1396285144

A. Refinance to remove the PMI that I pay. Which is about ~110 dollars a month. This would in reality only drop my monthly payments by 20-30 dollars. 

B. Refinance and take some equity out of the house, still removing the PMI. This would bump my payments up, 30-40 dollars a month. 


C. Wait. I don't NEED to pay off my parents/gf (no interest) right now, but moving forward would not have to worry about paying them and able to start saving. 


I'm leaning towards option B for 2 reasons;

-My monthly payment will only go up 30 dollars per month. 
-Able to pay off 3 debts; My parents (3300), my g/f(2300), my car(15.5).

I know that only the car has interest involved. However my parents are going to need the cash soon and I will not be able to pay it off completely when they need it. It is more of a personal relief to not have to worry about paying them (parents &amp; gf). I would be saving 325 dollars per month by eliminating my car payment, possibly more if I adjust my car insurance from Full Coverage. I paid roughly 700dollars last year in interest on the car. 

The interest rate on the house would go from 4.25 to 4.625. I plan on staying in the house for at lest 5-10 more years.

Bitcoin,"I am a tax attorney, here is the truth about 1099s and the $600 minimum threshold (for U.S. Taxpayers)","Hey guys, I've been seeing an alarming amount of confusion regarding 1099s and the $600 threshold mentioned in the recent IRS Notice.  I hope this helps to clear some things up.  

I should start off by saying that Form 1099 is an information return used to report certain types of payments that you make during the year.  The idea is that the payment recipient might ""forget"" to include the payment in his  taxable income at the end of the year, so requiring the payor to report the payment to the IRS will help make sure this doesn't happen.  There are a variety of different Form 1099s depending on the type of payment involved, the details of which aren't really important for our purposes.  

Here's the truth about Form 1099s and the $600 minimum threshold: 

**#1:  Personal transactions are not covered**

Form 1099s are required only for payments made in the course of a trade or business.   You do not need  to file a Form 1099 for personal transactions, like buying a new computer or a cup of coffee.   

*To be clear:  If you are not engaged in a trade or business, you do not need to worry about filing a form 1099.*  

Even if you are engaged in a trade or business, you do not need to worry about filing a form 1099 unless the payment was made in the course of your business.   Your personal transactions are never subject to 1099 reporting requirements.    If you want to know if you're engaged in a trade or business (perhaps as a bitcoin miner), here is a brief discussion of [the test for a trade or business used by the IRS](http://www.bitcointaxsolutions.com/is-my-mining-activity-a-business/).  


**#2:  The $600 threshold has nothing to do with capital gains**

There is no minimum threshold for reporting taxable gains.  It doesn't matter if your gain is $0.50 or $500,000.  Gain is gain, and if you are required to file an income tax return, you need to report all of your gains.  

The $600 threshold refers only to the requirement for filing a Form 1099.  Basically, the IRS understands that requiring a 1099 for every single payment made in the course of your business is too cumbersome.  So, it requires a 1099 only if the aggregate of all payments to a particular business/person exceed $600 during the year.  Again, this $600 is completely unrelated to how much gain/loss you might have on each payments.  


**#3: There is no special 1099 requirement for bitcoins.**

The point of the IRS Notice was to confirm that bitcoin transactions are subject to the same 1099 requirements as fiat transactions.  It did not create any new rules or special 1099 reporting requirements.  So, if your payment would not be reportable on a 1099 if it was done in cash, then it is not reportable on a 1099 if it is paid in bitcoin either.

Bitcoin,"Even by I.R.S. standards, the recent ruling on bitcoin flirts with nonsensical non-logic in a way that is truly shocking to an outsider. Govt officials have called bitcoin ""digital currency"" thousands of times, not once have they called it ""digital property"".","Really astonishing. For months, including the Senate hearing and the Treasury Department's own published documents on bitcoin always refer to it as a ""virtual currency,"" ""digital currency,"" or my favorite ""convertible virtual currency."" Don't take my word for it. Search through publicly available federal government documents that mention or address bitcoin in any way. It's always discussed as a convertible electronic currency, which it is, not as property.

If the government views bitcoin as property - for taxation purposes the same as selling ice cream sandwiches out of an ice cream truck - why was this not a topic broached during the Senate hearing? Why did former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke in his letter refer to ""virtual currency"" several times, and ""virtual property"" not once. His successor, Janet Yellen, has had an equally sane approach toward bitcoin.

Even by the sometimes byzantine logic of modern tax agencies, the IRS is simply wrong.

If mining Bitcoins is self employment, so is jerking off to porn.

If Bitcoin is primarily ""property"" and not currency, then why the focus on KYC/AML compliance? It's not money according to the IRS. And why the need for money transmitter licenses? And why is New York State trying to regulate Bitcoin if it's just property? Lawsky's job is over before it even begins, if this nonsensical IRS classification is not challenged and revised.

personalfinance,20/yo looking for advice on saving and planning for future,"I am a 20/yo female living in the US, and I've always said that I'd start saving for my future when I turned 20 and its certainly time.  I probably could have started a few years ago, but other factors would have made it challenging.  Now I'm looking at saving but I'm not sure what's the best course of action, whether I should just save or invest and if investing how and where...  

**Goals**
My long-term goals are to have 1mil saved by the time I'm 60 for retirement.  Although I'm sure this is an overly-generous number I like to set my goals high (and have never failed to meet them) and also really want to be able to enjoy my retirement and be able to travel the world and do all the things I couldn't do when I was working.  My family lives long lives and has good health well into their 80s so I see no reason to think I won't be able to be active far into retirement.  

**facts about me**

I currently work as a bartender/waitresses full time and bring in APPROX $400-$500 per week.  I have to approximate because I make a lot of my income in cash and my income swings vastly depending upon the time of year (I live a tourist area).  

I live with my partner so my living expenses are relatively low...rent and electric come out to about $300-350 depending upon the time of year (cold climate). 

Other expenses aren't too much...I'm not sure what we spend on food and other basics per month but I know that I charge most of my expenses to my credit card and that averages around $1000 per month including my phone and car insurance.  

Although I have a credit card I am in no credit card debt, I pay it off at the end of every month religiously.  

I'm in school...entering my senior year in fall for a bachelors degree in Business Management.  Thus far I'm 100% debt free, about $7000 comes from the government in grants per year and about $3000 I've paid out of pocket.  

I did buy a nice car in October of last year, a 2006 Jetta.  I put down a substantial down payment on it and took out a loan for $5200 (about $5600 with interest) and I've been aggressively paying it off and have it down to $3660 as of today.  :)  I also still have to sell my old car, but it's been buried in a snowbank since fall and it won't be melted out for probably another month.  I'm hoping to get $1000+ for it when I sell it.  

I have a $2000 emergency fund, but at this moment my checking account is pretty low (about $300) because I just finished paying off my credit card from this last month when we took a vacation, plus when I did my taxes the government decided they paid me too much in federal grants for school this year and made me pay them back for their mistake (seriously, if I make a financial mistake I have to pay for it...why are they any different?) and I ended up having to pay $2100 out of pocket which took a real hit on my finances.  

We currently live in a low cost of living but also low income area.  Probably in May or June of next year (after we both graduate college) we'll be looking at moving to a big city area, probably in the south (Atlanta GA maybe?) which will raise our cost of living but also dramatically raise our income potential.  However, there are going to be big moving costs involved and since I currently make way more I'm guessing most of them will fall on me.  

**how much can I save?**
I'm sure I could easily save $50 a week if I'm careful, maybe more.  Any advice on this topic?

**Save?  Invest?  Something Else Entirely?**
This is really where I need your advice!  I don't even know how to go about achieving my goal and need advice as to what to do with my money!",finance,1396304328
Bitcoin,"This was my first first Reddit post ever, now I have bad karma, should I be concerned?","""No offense to the lawyer that started the thread, but lest we not forget the IRS was instituted after the Federal Reserve Act was unlawfully ""passed"" without amending the constitution thereby purportedly transferring the power to coin money and control the value thereof from Congress to the Rothschilds and others. The tax you pay to the IRS goes directly to pay the interest on the loans the Federal Reserve grants the U.S. Government in what can only be called a perverted circle jerk. I call it this because the Federal Reserve is not ""Federal"" and has no ""reserves"". They create money from nothing and loan it to the government at interest that the IRS then seeks to collect from the debt slave, i.e. American citizens located anywhere on or off Planet, as the case may be. Finally one may ask what the hell is a black giant pyramid with 2 Freemason columns doing at the IRS headquarters.""

I posted this under the link initiated by a tax attorney looking to drum up business no doubt, nevertheless everything I said was factually correct so why the bad karma?",cryptocurrency,1396304991
personalfinance,"Long time lurker, PF has become my favorite subreddit!! Quick question?","Paying my debts off like it's advised here.

Just a quick question on repayment preferences!

Chase Slate Balance Transfer @ $ 4,300 till June 2015 @ 12.99 after that

PenFed Visa Balance Transfer @ $ 8,900 till Sep 2015 @ 9.9% after that

Car Loan @ $ 5,800 @ 1.49% @ $250 a month

My method was to pay min on chase, auto loan and just put all extra on penfed.

Only reason I contemplated paying auto loan off is that's an extra $ 250 a month towards another debt and car is old and has high miles. I'm scared of it breaking down while owing on it, lol

Thanks again for everyone's help, looking forward to a triumph Tuesday someday.",finance,1396308417
