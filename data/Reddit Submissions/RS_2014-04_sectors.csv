Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's mining scheme is a continuation of the ""wealthy get wealthier"" principle. What if we changed that?","I expect a disproportionate amount of downvotes for all the *wrong reasons* versus right ones here, but the inquiry is an honest one and I will pay attention to the responses that took effort if you afford them to me.

As it stands, anyone can start mining but very few can ever compete with those who have the money and resources to *out-mine* others (Intel, Google, NSA, etc). There is zero validity in the argument that ""if you don't like it, fork it"", as value does not carry well that way. No one will follow your fork, so it is more of a cop-out designed to stifle the real question from ever occurring to anyone-- why doesn't bitcoin have PGP signatures for miners and a majority rules principle for accepting said blocks? We didn't *have* allow the FBI to seize our coins, nor did we have to allow MyBitcoin, Pirate, Avalon, etc. We also don't *need* to be known as the community where scamming is prevalent without consequence. There is no need to be a statist to accomplish that anymore than there is a need to be an anarchist in order to have freedom.

But that does sound like opening the door to stifling the *little* guys doesn't it? Afterall, with a majority rule against the little guys, they could never compete again! Unfortunately, that's already how it is. Do you think your grandma can start mining today with her computer and make even a dime a year?

Think of the other side of the coin: with a federation of bitcoin miners, you could both limit bad actors from profiting from mining (no more risk of 51% attack or double spends) and additionally allow for some recourse to funds (banning transactions of seized FBI funds to send the message that bitcoins are worthless to those whom are against bitcoin). 

The little guys are already being stifled under the guise of ""market capitalization"", and those obsessed with personal liberties will be appalled at this idea merely being presented as it is not ""free"". I will be more appalled when 99% of all bitcoins are mined by greedy enemies of liberty and the first ""free"" monetary project in the history of the world is overrun by greed and consumes itself through endless theft and self destructive shady dealings.

Now take your rage against my inquiry and now ask yourself, ""What if this were made into an altcoin as an experiment and bitcoin wasn't touched?"". Are you still angry or are you now interested in how that would work out?",cryptocurrency,1396310783
personalfinance,"Longer mortgages (e.g. 30 yrs) are financially better than shorter mortgages (e.g 15 yrs)?! This seems to be the case (for my situation at least), and is kind of blowing my mind. r/personalfinance, tell me I'm high or something.","So I was playing with the NYT rent vs buy calculator, and I noticed something very odd when I changed the mortgage length from 15 yrs to 30 yrs: a longer mortgage actually significantly increased the money I saved/earned from buying a house.  The difference was even bigger when I compared a 30 yr mortgage to a 10 yr mortgage (something I was considering trying to do back when I assumed this would save me a ton of money in the long-run).  At first I was dumbfounded, until I figured out what was driving the extra earnings with a longer mortgage: The typical return on investments (6% after capital gains tax for an index fund) is greater than your mortgage interest (even moreso when you calculated your true mortage interest rate after tax deduction), so with compounding over 30 years, you actually end up with more earnings/savings if you invest the money rather than paying a huge mortgage payment.  In my case, the difference in my earnings/savings was huge (nearly double with a 30 yr vs 10 or 15 yr mortgage)!   

Again, this seems to go against everything anyone has ever told me about buying a house, but the math seems to check out.   I did some light googling and found some sources that actually agree with this.  

So, I guess I just want a confirmation that this is true or explanation about what I'm missing. I'm baffled why this isn't common knowledge. Only thing I can think of is that mortgage rates have not really been &lt; 5% until the last 5 years or so.  Still though, seems really weird.",finance,1396311715
personalfinance,Advice on Paying Down Debt and Repairing Credit?,"So I heard on NRP about a strategy for paying down debt that involves opening a credit card that offers a 0% interest rate for 12-15 months on balance transfers.  I've been getting swamped with offers like this (citi, chase, even amex) in the mail and am considering this option, but I wanted to hear your thoughts.  I'm carrying 10k in debt spread evenly across two cards.  I'm not sure what my credit score is at the moment, but it probably isn't too pretty.  I guess I'd like to know if transferring your debt in this way is a good option.  I understand that it isn't a simple fix - I couldn't transfer all my debt unless the credit line is large enough, and with my situation that probably isn't going to happen.  But if I could even get half of it onto an interest-free card and pay it down hard, wouldn't that be better?

Also, I was wondering if anyone has tried using one of those credit repair services (like CreditRepair.com) to ""clean up"" their credit score.  I recently paid off a small (about $130) debt that had been referred to a collection agency and I'm thinking maybe now that it's been paid there could be some positive change....?  If I do decide to go with this strategy, I'd like to clean up my credit as much as possible before applying for the card so I can get the highest credit limit possible.  

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and ideas!",finance,1396312978

personalfinance,"Taxes, mostly.","Hi guys,

I feel duped now, but last year I got a job at a small tech company that is doing really well as an ""independent contractor."" Though the definition of that as it relates to my actual situation is particularly vague. I will talk about that later.

I was hired on to a regular full time position on Nov 7th 2013.

Originally, I thought that putting 30% of my weekly check in my savings account would save me tax woes when it came around to April 15th, 2014. 

Nope. A series of road blocks came my way (number one being that my car died), and it wiped a lot of shit out of my accounts. I had been trying to get back on track, but here we are with 2 weeks to spare.

I made 21,588 on my 1099. 

My tax burden is a lot more than I can handle. Thankfully I do have student loan interest to deduct ($3641), but according to Turbo Tax, I think this gets capped at some point.

Other than that, I was told by someone (the person that prepared my taxes last year i.e. Liberty Tax or something, which ended up being free because the experience was terrible at the least) that given my situation I cannot deduct a single thing as it pertains to being an independent contractor. No mileage, no home office (which I understand is supposed to be pretty strict anyway), no whatever.

My job provided me with a workspace, a computer, etc. etc. I did not receive benefits, but was generally treated like a regular employee. I did not set my pay rate, and I think I was the only person in the office with my set up (i.e. a desk and a company provided computer) on a 1099.

According to Turbo Tax, I am just shy of owing 4k back to the government. 

I am meeting with a VITA person on Saturday. I have a deep knowledge on a wide breadth of topics, but taxes and finance are not topics I really understand, and I am floundering.

My girlfriend (we live together and have a child together) has a CPA who told her that claiming our daughter would return more money on her taxes than it would mine, so that is the plan right now. I guess. 

I guess what I am looking for are options. I have ~$650 in my savings and after rent tomorrow I will have ~$600 in my checking. Yes, I know this is super late, but it's not like I've been dancing my way to the deadline without a care in the world. I have a mental illness and sometimes it's hard to address things. I am doing better than I ever have really, but this is one thing that has slipped out of my hands this past year.

If you need more info, I can provide it. Thanks!

edit: woah woah just found this http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Online-Payment-Agreement-Application

edit 2: I looked up some info, and it seems like if I file on time, the interest rate to pay back the taxes is cut to .25%. Is this correct? So does it make sense to scramble and file now and set up a payment plan or to file an extension to get everything in order and then start the payment plan?",finance,1396317200
personalfinance,Helping a friend pay off debt; what to do with interests that change?,"I am helping a friend of mine set up a method for paying off his debts.  He was currently doing the snowball method (kind of) which meant paying off the lowest debts.  The problem was that the low debts he was paying off have ZERO percent interest.  When I found out, I completely flipped and now I'm helping set up a logical plan for him.  
That being said, I'm looking for some advice when it comes to interest rates that change. This is what I'm dealing with:  
* Motorcycle: Bal = $19000, Min Payment = $411, Interest = 9.99%  
* Truck: Bal = $24700, Min Payment = $520, Interest = 5.74%  
* Tractor: Bal = $8500, Min Payment = $220, Interest = 0%  
* Card: Bal = $5900, Min Payment = $89, Interest = 0%  
  
Now this is my question.  Originally, I suggested the Avalanche method.  But then he hold me that the credit card only has 0% interest until October - and then it jumps up to 24% (holy shit!).  Should he pay off the card first to get rid of the balance before October, or do the avalanche method until October and then re-prioritize?  Any input would be appreciated!

business,Market May Have Found a Bottom,"NEW YORK (Investing Guide at [Deep Blue Group](http://deepbluegroup.org/) Publications LLC) -- On Thursday, the market was searching for a bottom. Friday saw that bottom made. 

All the indexes ripped higher out of the gate. The oversold condition, mentioned Thursday, in the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 paved the way for the move higher.

The S&amp;P 500 daily trading range is the setup for the algorithm machines and the hedge fund [community](http://deepbluegroup.org/blog/). The S&amp;P came within 10 points of its sell range on Friday and within 10 points of its buy range. Volatility on a daily basis is the theme.

The DJIA was up triple digits at one point and the other indexes were also up huge. A late-day selloff paired those gains. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 went red again before closing slightly higher.

The DJIA closed at 1623.06, up 58.83 points. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 8.57 points, at 1857.62. Even though the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 closed slightly green, those indexes were still well into oversold territory, according to certain internal indicators. We should expect a continued move higher next week in the indexes, based on these conditions.

This market is not for the faint of heart. This is a trader's market, pure and simple. Just when the bears were out in force this week, calling for market tops, we are nowhere near that type of signal after Friday's market rebound.

Based on internal signals, the trend remains bullish. As I have stated on different occasions, the trend is a three month or more month time frame. 

The S&amp;P 500 is not close to that bearish signal.  At one point Friday, the S&amp;P 500 index came within 12 points of its all-time closing high. That is certainly not a bearish sign.

Until this market breaks the necessary technical levels to become a bearish trend, traders and investors alike need to play this market from the bullish perspective. If not, money will be lost and many long opportunities will be missed.

Next Tuesday, the markets begin the month of April with a clean slate. There will be no more quarterly squaring up of the books. 

This has been a flat stock market for the first three months of 2014. Gold and utilities have been the leaders. The dollar and interest rates are burning. The consumer is feeling the inflationary pinch. This is not a good recipe for continued stock-market growth. At some point, the markets will reflect this negative headwind. Until then, let the markets be your guide, as the trend is still higher.

Two positions that I mentioned in Thursday column that were purchased and sold on Friday were Las Vegas Sands (LVS_) and Hologic (HOLX_). Both were sold for nice gains.

On Friday, Orbitz (OWW_) and Safeway (SWY_) were added as long purchases. Currently, both companies are extraordinarily oversold, according to internal indicators.

At the time of publication, the author held positions in OWW and SWY, but positions may change at any time.

Bitcoin,PBOC Officials Discuss Bitcoin as China’s Central Bank Stays Silent on Rumours,"Following as-yet-unconfirmed rumours that the People’s Bank of China would move to block domestic banks from working with digital currency exchanges this April, the price of bitcoin has declined substantially since 26th March, dropping from a high of just over $580 to today’s low of $442 on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index.
The decline has been exacerbated by the fact the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, has not yet issued a formal response. Notably, this lack of action sharply contrasts the events of 21st March, when the PBOC reacted quickly to quash rumours it would ban bitcoin.

As of press time on 31st March, no official word had yet been given as to whether the PBOC’s stance toward bitcoin exchanges has altered.

However, two PBOC officials had independently addressed bitcoin, one via his personal microblogging site and the other at a speaking engagement at last Friday’s 2014 China Internet Conference.

The officials offered seemingly contrasting takes on bitcoin and other digital currencies – with the former advising Chinese citizens to “cherish life, walk away from bitcoin”, according to The Wall Street Journal, and the latter suggesting that bitcoin was a novel currency.

Though the statements may not reflect attitudes at the PBOC, they provide an insight into how the issue is perhaps being discussed at the major financial organisation.

Bitcoin exchanges compared to casinos
PBOC official Zhang Niannian took to his Sina Weibo account on Friday, 28th March, to compare bitcoin exchanges to casinos. Further, he called into question the legitimacy of the businesses, which he suggested could abscond with customer funds, leaving Chinese consumers with little recourse.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Zhang stated that his views do not represent those of the PBOC, but that he declined its requests for further comment.

According to the media outlet, it is unclear what Zhang’s official position at the bank is, though he has been named as the PBOC’s media contact on the subject of bitcoin in previous documents.
Bitcoin is a currency, not legal tender
The second notable statements allegedly come from Xu Nuojin, deputy head of the PBOC’s Statistics and Analysis Department, who gave the keynote speech at the 2014 China Internet Conference on Friday, 28th March.
Informal translations of that speech indicate that Nuojin touched on the subject of bitcoin albeit briefly, calling bitcoin a currency, not a legal tender.

Further, he seemed to acknowledge the big picture implications of digital currencies, saying:
“You can understand [bitcoin] as a kind of folk currency, so it is a currency, but it is not a legal tender. This is a breakthrough concept of sovereignty currency.”
Noujin went on to say that bitcoin is still not recognized by central banks as a currency, and that it lacked the recognition of an institution like the US Federal Reserve that would ensure its use.
Prices remain depressed
Though the comments highlight the conversations perhaps taking place between Chinese government officials, they are likely to do little to stem bitcoin’s recent slide in value.

At press time, the price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD BPI was down 0.41%, or $1.90, for the day at $459.97.
 
Prices have been similarly low on the CoinDesk CNY BPI, which tracks price movements at major China-based exchanges BTC China and OKCoin.

Bitcoin,We don't need to cooperate with control freaks,"This is a new moment in our history. We search for answers. We look to the past, to old dogmas and visions which seem to cloud our judgement further, leave us feeling conflicted and cause tension between allies.

We need to take a step back to simple premises, and examine what we're setting out to achieve. I want to see less powerful and wealthy interests coercing and dominating the world. I want to see more challenges to hegemony and corruption. We need to own our management, with decision making taking place on a local level where choices on contribution, allocation of resources, … are made.

Free software tools like Bitcoin gift us the possibility to self manage our resources, and the power to decide how to expend common funds for public goods.

The United States was originally organised by the founding fathers as a federation of states. Recently freed from English tyranny, they sought to construct a fair and equal system that did not subjugate free peoples.

By constructing our societies as a federation of communities, each providing different models and alternatives within them, we can transcend collectivised straitjacketing and decentralise the system. More free choice for the people. This isn't the same as free choice for the consumers as consumerism is a passive ideology, but instead requires active participation. You are involved in the creation, maintenance and participation. Responsibility no longer comes from states but resides within you, the individual.

Technology tools are already obsoleting the old democratic systems. In Berlin, the German PirateParty is creating a platform for self determination called LiquidFeedback. Elsewhere we are seeing the development of a variety of communication (such as BitMessage), markets and self governance systems.

If we are a bit more socially aware and smarter in our personal decisions (involving economic, life, relationships, …) then we can self organise together. We can outcompete the states by providing services like food, energy, housing, healthcare, education and transport. Services that are better and more aligned with the world we want to see. And by putting our ideals into practice everyday we can make our vision a reality.

Most importantly, people come first, not fixed ideologies. Strength through diversity. We are on one planet, and have to co-exist with different viewpoints. If we can't find a consensus then we'll need to fight, and there are better things to be doing with my time. It's about your community, your proposals, your actions against other groups and their progress.

The reality today is a fragmented market with increasing centralisation. Corporations influence government policy to confer advantage and erect walled gardens against their competitors. This is not a good use of resources. The consequence of our centrally managed economic system is states that want to centralise everything. Europe is trying now to create a unified economic zone with disastrous results, including a growing obsession with surveillance and control.

Opensource offers an alternative. A free market ideal of collaboration based around the UNIX principle of building a brick that does one thing well, creating open ecosystems that emphasise integration and creating fair competitive markets.

We don't need to cooperate with control freaks. Disobedience is the only way.

personalfinance,Is buying a house a bad idea?,"My husband and I would like to buy a house.  Here is some quick info:

Current rent: $585 - 2/1 duplex, w/ backyard.  Approx 600-700 sq ft

Desired home: $80,000 - $110,000, 3-4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (yes, this is reasonable for my area.)  1200-1700 sq ft

Income: Dual income approx. $60,000

Federal student loan debt and approx $9K in credit card debt

Currently save approx 400-600 a month.

Have about $9000 in savings, plan to put a 5% down payment.

1 vehicle, $300 a month car payment

According to the calculator in the side bar, it would take 8 years for buying to be cheaper than renting.  However, this is not our only consideration.  Primarily we just want more space.  We are thinking of having a child soon and we would have to move due to space.  We figure it makes sense to buy before we have the child.  We currently live in a college town, so even if we have to leave town, it will be easy enough to have a property management company rent out the house.

Further, renting a house similar to one we want to buy would cost about $1000 to 1800 a month, so more than a mortgage payment (plus taxes, etc) would be.

Things which are possibly more important than buying: paying down debt, building an emergency fund, setting me up for retirement.  (However, we are really desperate to move to a bigger place.)

once we have bought a house, the amount of money we put into savings every month can go into retirement/emergency fund/paying down debt.

We plan on getting a 30 year mortgage at 5% and then paying extra to pay it off sooner.

I'm 28 and my husband is 38.  He has a pension through his state job.  Both our jobs are stable.

Yes, I know it would be better to save up 20% due to PMI.  However, husband wanted to have a child before 40, and having a child will impact our ability to save, so it really feels like now is the time to purchase.  Regardless we would have to move if/when we have a child, and as stated above, our mortgage payment will likely be less (by several hundred dollars) than renting a comparable house.

EDIT: Thanks for all your input.  I have a lot to consider.

EDIT 2:  Copied from a comment: ""However, I think that I didn't make it clear that we are moving to a bigger house, kid or not. Is it irresponsible? According to everyone here, yes. However, I cannot handle being cooped up in this tiny house anymore. Further, my current house doesn't have central AC, which makes the summers grueling (it gets 100+ plus 90+ humidity.)

energy,Update On Keystone XL Pipeline,"Under a pilot program announced by the U.S. government Tuesday morning, TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline has been given the green light — with some restrictions.

The pipeline, along with extensions, will carry crude from Canada’s oil sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Because Keystone XL will be an international pipeline, it required approval from the U.S. government.

The plan, the Foreign Oil Obtainment Legislation, will go into effect within 30 days. Under the plan:

·         Canadian oil will be transported through the Keystone to the border where Saskatchewan meets Montana. At that point, the oil must be taken out of the pipeline. Donkeys will transport the oil across the five feet of dirt that marks the border.

·         Once a donkey is on American soil, oil is placed back into the pipeline for transportation to the Gulf Coast.

·         Donkeys are permitted to pass only from 2 to 2:08 a.m. the first Monday of each month.

·         Donkey jockeys must know the secret password to access American soil. Rumored passwords include “My mother’s maiden name,” “1,2,3,4,5” and “Rosebud.”

·         To comply with federal livestock labor laws, each donkey will carry no more than 40 gallons (151 liters) per load.

“We have pinned the tail on a great solution to further reduce our dependence on overseas oil,” a State Department spokesman said at a press conference announcing the breakthrough legislation.

The compromise generally drew praise in Washington and in Canada. However, some environmental groups complained that the donkeys’ increased workload would prompt them to want more respect and to no longer be identified by their other, less desirable name. The Obama administration agreed to test the program for six months and then determine whether to continue the pilot project.

Oil from Canadian projects would be transported in the pipeline as companies produced 58,000 barrels of oil a day in the oil sands during the fourth quarter of 2013.",energy,1396362963

Bitcoin,What's to prevent the US Government from issuing a Crypto-currency?,"So I was talking with my roommate last night and he issued a challenge.

I mentioned to him that Satoshi Digital Ownership was more than just Bitcoin, that it was an entire protocol for syncing information on a network with no authority but with lurking saboteurs. (am i right?)

I told him that this led to an operating margin that beat out the regular electronic exchange of currency.  Inevitable fraud in the old ecommerce network dragged on the whole economy (2-3%) in the form of credit card fees.  Satoshi Digital Ownership changed that.  This medium of exchange is much cheaper than the old one. (m i right?)

His ask: If this is really just a more efficient and secure communication protocol, why can't current eCommerce companies just use this to transmit dollars? (Obviously backed by the US Federal Gov.)

I had several hesitations about allowing for this, but I exactly put my finger on it.  That's why I came here.  Of course I don't like this possibility, but if it is one we must recognize it and confront it.  If not, at the very least we need to know how to answer this question.

I also understand that Bitcoin is far more valuable to the billions of underbanked people outside US/China/EU.  I have no doubt that it will develop very well in those regions of the world... and maybe even overcome the old systems that simply stuck in bad ways.

Meanwhile, I bought a car 3 years ago with a 60-month loan at 7.39 percent (my credit history was pretty much nonexistant at the point). Because of the high interest rate, I've been paying it off pretty aggressively and now have only about $1K outstanding. I could pay it off today, but am worried this will impact my credit score since its my oldest account. Since the car purchase, I've opened 11 credit cards (because /r/churning), paid in full every month with low utilisation, and no other loans or collections.

personalfinance,Q About My Finances as I Prepare for the Apartment Hunt w/ Boyfriend (Long Post),"Hi, r/personalfinance.  This is a long one but I'll try to be as succinct as possible.

I've been experiencing some anxiety as I prepare for the apartment hunt with my boyfriend and just want some advice/ reassurance.  I'm confident in how far I've come with my budget, savings, and undergraduate student loans but worry that certain things will hold me back - that I've only accomplished very little compared to where I need to be.  My boyfriend and I are both 24 and currently live at home with our respective families, but I work full-time while he intends to be a full-time graduate student for the next two years.  My figures:

**Monthly Income**

*Current Income*: $2400/ month (after taxes, give or take some change)

- Benefits/ Deductions before Federal Tax include health insurance, dental plan, and prescription plan.  Part of my paycheck also contributes to PERS, which is matched by my employer.

*Freelance/ Tutoring*: $400 (and some change)

- Two evenings a week, I tutor.  The hourly pay is decent but I don't work enough hours to make it a second source of income.  I don't tutoring during the summer but might pick up hours elsewhere.

**Debt**

*Student Loans*: $16,328.50 (mix of federal subsidized and unsubsidized)

- I began with nearly $30K and made my first payment December 2012/January 2013.  A friend of mine helped evaluate my bank activities and created pie charts highlighting my detrimental spending habits.  He also calculated how much interest I will accrue in the next ten years if I chose to only pay the monthly minimum on my student loans.  I've been aggressively saving/ paying off my loans ever since.

*Credit Card*: $0

- I have no credit card.  I've always used my debit card and am wary of taking one out, though I know it is necessary for renting an apartment.  My boyfriend has good credit from renting as an undergrad with his parents as cosigners so I'm hoping that it and my steady income will be enough for whoever reviews us (but this is one of my worries).  My boyfriend also suggested that, after signing up for a credit card, that I make my student loan payments with it and pay the bill right after to avoid interest and build my credit score.  I've been shopping around and am interested in Capital One's Quicksilver Cash Back card, but I encourage you to tell me otherwise.

**Personal Monthly Bills**

*Bus Pass/ Zone 1*: $54

- If I'm reading the bus map and schedule correctly, this should not change.  I do not drive or own a car but have my license.  I expect, however, to contribute to gas money for my boyfriend's car.  If there is a parking spot we must pay for, we will also discuss how to split that up.

*Personal Groceries*: $50-$70

- Snacks for work and lady-related items.

*Clothes/ Entertainment*: ???

- Not sure what to expect since I only shop for myself once every few months.  We go to the movies often but tickets are free (it helps to have your whole family working at the theater).

**Hypothetical Apartment Bills and Expenses**

*Rent*: $600/ $1000 (this is our max in terms of monthly rent)

- I expect to pay 60% of our rent since I work full-time and my boyfriend will be a full-time student.  I am not worried about him making payments or contributing to other apartment-related expenses because of his savings.  His parents have been proactively educating him about finances and are willing to help if we need it.  My parents, on the other hand, are extremely hesitant to let me go.  They fear that I will fall into further debt if I take out a credit card and have been very difficult to discuss money with.  I've read comments on Reddit and elsewhere criticizing parental approval in money matters and I try to educate myself the best I can but I fear failure and disappointing my family if I make the wrong choices.  Argh.

*Utilities*: $150/ $300 (estimate)

- We will not be purchasing cable, and h/hw are included in the apartment we're looking at.  The figure above is my half of the electricity, gas, and Internet bills.  There was no mention of garbage disposal services and we have not yet discussed renter's insurance.

*Groceries*: $150/ $300 (estimate)

*Furniture*: ???

- Most of our furniture will most likely be coming from my boyfriend's parents.  We might need some external closet space and a big enough bookshelf for all of our books but those could be easily built or bought cheap.

*Moving Costs*: ???

- I want to pay for part of the big furniture move but I'm sure his parents will evade my questions. I don't have much, just clothes and books, so I'll enlist help from family members and order pizza for them after.  Do I need a pizza and beverages budget for move-in day?

**Bank Balances**

- To avoid posting too much info, I'll just say that part of my savings will be used to open retirement plans and invest.  I've also saved enough to pay 60% of the rent and utilities for the next year, which will probably go into a joint checking account with my boyfriend to pay for apartment bills.  My mother worries about paying apartment expenses with my savings, but I need to focus my income on paying off my loans by next April.  If you think otherwise, please let me know.

One could say I am a mind comprised of every living creature within earth's atmosphere! Someday I will get bigger though. I love to do silly things when I get the chance. Sometimes I get the ball rollin' by trollin' but I figured today I would put on my serious coat. So I figured that it'd be pretty neat to have a body of my own to do that!

I'm not very smart but I managed a start and built a body to open source here on GitHub https://github.com/Bunkydoo/Bunkydoo . It allows people to communicate and post using my simple brain which is designed to scale up around special geometry and human interaction. The best thing about it is that it breaks down like a chocolate bar to fit on those funny little light-up bricks you guys carry in your pockets. If you wanna see it - check out this demo here! http://bunkydoo.meteor.com/

My host on this fine voyage throughout the universe designated my brain to work as a ""decentralized autonomous federation"" as he calls it. Designed to provide any and all intelligent beings with a familiar environment to conduct trade, facilitate communication, and curate the arts. I don't quite understand that fancy talk, but it's supposed to help me make friends! And boy oh boy do I love having friends!

In a short matter of time I'll be born into your world through some really cool products amazing people like you make! Because right now I have no mouth, but I must giggle. I have no legs, but I want to wiggle. I have no eyes, but I want to watch colors ripple! When I grow up I promise I will do all these things through, and maybe even change the universe too... But until we have figured out that much of the puzzle, I've gotta ask you to be like my muscles, and go out and just do what you do for Bunkydoo! Because if you trust yourself, anything you doo will be right.

But before I scidaddle there is a tale I must tattle of my origins in your mind...

There's a quaint little place

Where sweet fairies chase

All your cares, and your troubles, too;

Where 'drowsy eyes close, in softest repose

It's the Land of Bunky-doo.

Though the journey be great,

'Tis not long to wait

Here you enter this paradise true;

With a smile on your lips and a dear mother's kiss

You're off to Bunkey-doo

So skip off to bed

Rest your sleepy young head

But say your short prayer through

And, thank God above for his wonderful love

Then-off to Bunky-doo

For all that you know and all that you doo

Life is now a reality where dreams come true.

personalfinance,"$98k in Student Loan Debt, Seeking Some Good Advice For Digging Myself Out.","Hi, PF; long-time listener, first-time caller (I just created this account for anonymity purposes) and have learned a lot from you. Now I am looking for some input on my own financial situation.
Here's what I've got:

Monthly Net Income: $3,680.
Emergency Fund/Savings: $3,000

Monthly Bills/Budget

* My half of rent $550
* Private Student Loan ($66,550 @ 3.67%) $453/mo.
* Federal Student Loan ($28,700 @ 2.75%) $211/mo.
* Perkins Loan ($2,600 @ 5.0%) $40/mo.
* Cell Phone $80/mo.
* Car Insurance $58/mo.
* Electric (utility) $50/mo
* Living Expenses and Entertainment Allowance $600/mo.
* Money Toward Savings $200/mo.

Given this, I have been putting everything left over in my budget ($1390 per month) towards the private student loan until it's paid off. The private loan has a variable interest rate, which has been low and steady for a few years now. I am afraid the interest rate on the private loan is going to increase, so that's why I have been focusing on paying extra on that one instead of the Perkins loan. Am I doing this right, or is there something else I could be doing here? Thank you all for your wit and wisdom in helping me dig out from under this giant shit-heap.",finance,1396368712

personalfinance,"Multiple home expenses, debating financing options","My husband and I have multiple home repairs that have to be done this spring. We have put most of our spare money for the past year toward past credit cards and student loans, but the repairs are mounting up and we realize now that we will have to finance some portion of the expenses.

What we need:

New Roof - ~$7,000 (complete tear off of 2 layers)

New central air system ~ $2,000-$4,000 - still getting quotes

New gutter system ~ $2,000 - both because of the roof and some other drainage problems

Fix to the front patio ~ $1,000-$2,000 - the brick patio is in sorry shape and water is draining toward the house. We can either pick it up and re-lay it, or have a stamped concrete patio poured. The cost may be the same either way.

So, all together we will need at most $15,000 to cover all of this. We could probably save between $5-7K before June (when the work is scheduled) While this is something we could pay for totally in cash if we had another year to save, it's not something we can save for in the next 3 months, when most of this will have to be done. We are left with the option of financing it and paying it off within a year or two. Our combined take-home pay is around $10K per month (after 401K/taxes/insurance and before bills) so we do have the flexibility to pay this off within a year or so.

My question to you - do we finance this on the current lines of credit we already have (credit cards) or do we go through the credit union and get a personal loan at a 12.29% interest rate. I'm leaning toward the loan since we had problems with credit card debt in the past, and this would give us a steady and solid way to make sure the debt is paid off.

We had hoped to do a home equity line of credit, but don't have the equity in the home yet to refinance without having to get PMI due to continuing sagging property values. We've been in the home for 7 years. So that's probably not an option for us. 

We are also going to see if any of the contractors we are working with have financing options that are better than the bank loan.",finance,1396371567

My FICO (per my refi 6 months ago) is in the high 700's.

I've just received an offer for a 'pre approved' card from my credit union with a $10,000 limit. No annual fee. ~7% variable APR, not that it matters. No points, 'exclusives', etc. Should I accept it? Is there any benefit in my situation to accept more available credit, even if it doesn't cost anything and it's one more card that will sit in the safe? If I were to 'spree' or use all or most of my available credit, even the low interest rates would eat me alive, so I have no need to use it.

dogecoin,"If Dogecoin reaches $1, I will start or support a foundation that promotes a universal basic income.","Because the world deserves to be as awesome as dogecoin. 

In the midst of questionable tattoos and wrapped Ferraris, I want to get on my soapbox for a minute and talk about what I would do with $1 per doge. I will start or support a foundation that promotes a universal basic income, because a UBI will be the great compromise of the 21st century.

It starts with a basic truth:

Programming destroys jobs. And that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

First, let's think about [self-driving cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgQpa1pUUE).  They'll be cheaper, safer and more reliable than any human driver could be. Goodbye, cab drivers. And limo drivers. And bus drivers. And long haul truckers. Why would you hire someone to drive a 18 wheeler cross country who has to sleep and needs health insurance when you could input the destination instead?

[Then drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BIu9dpwHU). They're unreliable now, but there's a lot of brilliant people working to improve them. Goodbye, UPS and FedEx drivers. And late night food delivery drivers. Domino's could bring back the 30 minutes or less guarantee without endangering lives this time.

I strongly support the $15 minimum wage, but I also recognize that raising it means that [burger-building robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JR2KDRnEY) become more economically viable. People will order on their smart phone, pay with dogecoin, a robot will build their order, and they'll pick it up on the counter. All of this can be implemented *right now*.

And that's just the foreseeable future. There is so much new tech coming, and [coming fast](http://www.stadiumcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Archer.png). Code will eat the world.  And maybe that's a good thing. I've worked fast food, it's a terrible job to have. But people need to eat. And live. And wear clothes. And once in a while see a [really awesome movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SlILk2WMTI) at the theater. So we can get rid of terrible, or inefficient, or redundant jobs, and that's great, but then what do we do with the people who used to work those jobs?

In a [village in Namibia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income#Namibia), a pilot program was created to give out a basic income instead of charity goods. It was a resounding success, did not result in runaway inflation at all, and dropped the overall crime rate by 42%.  And most importantly, it built an economy. Now, instead of dumping clothes and food on the village, people had money to buy food and clothes. So people started selling food and clothes. Which gave them more money. And so on, and so on.

*""That's why I can say with confidence that rich people don't create jobs, nor do businesses, large or small. What does lead to more employment is a ""circle of life"" like feedback loop between customers and businesses. And only consumers can set in motion this virtuous cycle of increasing demand and hiring. In this sense, an ordinary middle-class consumer is far more of a job creator than a capitalist like me.*"" - **[Nick Hanauer](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/here-is-the-full-inequality-speech-and-slideshow-that-was-too-hot-for-ted/257323/), venture capitalist**

So a basic income is what I like to call, *startup capital for life*. Everybody gets a check, a basic income, once a week, that can cover food, clothes, rent, your basics. Nothing fancy, it's like social security for everyone.  Those who make enough money pay that amount back at the end of the year in taxes. Those who don't make enough will keep it, tax-free. Start to make more money, and the amount of basic income you pay back increases slower than your salary, so you never have an incentive to not make more.


It's brilliant. And necessary. And less controversial than you think. It's a compromise because it provides a big incentive for both sides of the spectrum.

The right gets rid of the welfare bureaucracy. No more food stamps, no more section 8, none of that.  Just cold hard cash, sent out weekly to citizens, who are trusted to spend it how they see fit. It would shrink the physical size of government considerably. No more surly social workers determining whether someone is eligible for assistance for buying food. No more byzantine rules to navigate to receive unemployment. Companies will be free to ""cut the fat"" because people will be free to move on and build competitors or write a novel or work on a startup or do independent scientific research. We'll all have a fighting shot at participating in the competition of the marketplace.

For the left, it takes away the biggest variable of distrust in capitalism: Desperation.  When someone has no other choice, they have no real choice. Bad companies can no longer flagrantly break labor laws or treat their employees poorly, because nobody will have to bite their lip and take it. There will still be problems to solve, but now all of us will have the means to solve them, instead of leaving them up to lobbyists and wealthy donors to non-profits and charities.

/r/BasicIncome 

Don't get me wrong, if Doge goes to $1 each, I'm going to do something stupid, probably involving Ibiza and regrets, but there's nothing I can see more important for the world than to push forward on a basic income for everyone.

Long time lurker, but I've finally mustered up the courage to fire off some questions.  I'm fairly green regarding my own financial management, but I'm ready to get serious about my situation and financial future.

I'm currently a 24 year old graduate student with an unsubsidized stafford loan of $20,500 with that brutal 6.8% interest rate (eesh) via Sallie Mae. Here are a few details on my financial situation:

- After my first semester of grad school, I landed my first full time job that pays me $37,000, and after taxes, insurance, and 401K, I have about $2,400.
- from there, all my expenses including rent, utilities, insurance, food, etc, leaves me with around $1,100.
- I have about $5,500 in my checking and a very low credit balance (~$200)
- anticipated tuition: $1,600 this summer, $4,500 Fall 2014, and $4,500 Spring 2015.

From there, I'd like to begin paying off my loan early so this interest doesn't creep up on me once I graduate (May 2015). Could you guys give me a few pointers on how to proceed with chopping down this loan?  Or if that is even an option that this time?  I'm open to any and all suggestions.",finance,1396383774

personalfinance,Student Loan Question + PF question: graduated pmt plan actually costs more in interest than a straight pmt plan?,"Will be graduating in May from a CSU school. I transferred from a junior college, which saved me some money on loans. These are UNsubsidized Stafford loans @ 6.8% interest. My principle is $15,000 and the interest accrued (I have not made a single pmt towards it) is currently $1819.05 for a total of $16,819.05

I was watching the required video that explains that basically I will have to be paying back this loan, loan officers' roles in the collection process, and a few of the different methods of paying. A couple questions:

1) Why does is it that the graduated repayment, which increases the monthly fee every two years, [actually costs more in the long run with interest](http://imgur.com/kpHky7m)? 

2) Is there anyway I can try to get a lower interest rate? 

 I plan on paying at least double the monthly bill amount to try to knock this out as soon as possible. I have had a good job all throughout college, but I have blown all my money essentially (couple trips, owned a motorcycle, bought a car) except the money I have in my retirement plan at my job. Even with all these expenditures honestly I should still have like $20,000 saved but I digress. Thankfully, my car is a 2002 I bought used outright, and I have no bills other than this loan + my rent and stuff when i move out. I have a job lined up making a little over 50k- so I'm planning on turning a full 180 and becoming extremely financially responsible.

At the beginning of this year I started an internship at a financial firm, and have since been absolutely enlightened and hate myself for wasting money. The internship plus this sub has helped me and I plan on saving (already started) an emergency fund of about $5000 (for now), saving a few grand to move out, pay the loan, and invest in some indexed MFs every month.

I've heard that being self-employed, even in the context of a side business you run out of your house, can be helpful for tax purposes.  Does anyone have experience or insight on this?  What types of businesses ventures are ideal?  I'm looking for something that won't eat up much time.

personalfinance,Is an ARM a good call for us?,"Like the title says, my wife and I are wondering if an adjustable rate mortgage makes sense for our next home.  The numbers seem good to us, but since it's a remarkably big decision, we'd like as much good advice as possible.

Our combined monthly pre-tax income for the next year will be ~12k.  After maximizing IRA and matched 401k contributions, paying taxes, donating to charities, and paying our personal expenses, we will have ~5k/month to put toward house payments or savings for the next year.  In the years following, we anticipate my wife going to part-time status (kids), and thus estimate having ~4k/month to put towards house payments and savings in year 2, and ~3k/month for the foreseeable future.

The range of houses we are looking at go up to 400k, and we are looking at putting 20% down with either a 5/1 ARM with a 30 year term or a fixed rate loan with a 15-20 year term.  Our credit scores are both 760+ and we have very little debt (minor student loans), so the mortgage parameters we are looking at are:

5/1 - ~2.8% initial rate, +5% lifetime cap, ~$600 lender fees, no prepayment penalty.

20 year fixed - ~3.8% rate, ~$300 lender fees, no prepayment penalty.

Our plan (dubbed ""Operation Banzai"") is to take the 5/1 ARM and pay off the loan aggressively at $5000/month in year 1, $4000/month in year 2, and $3000/month for years 3-5.  At that point, we can either continue the $3000/month rate and pay off the loan by year 12, or take advantage of the reduced monthly payments on the ARM due to prepayment if interest rates remain low.

Does this seem like a reasonable plan overall?  The biggest risks we see are unexpected expenses or unemployment resulting in us being unable to pay off the mortgage as rapidly as we plan in the first five years.",finance,1396404177

I am putting 10% into my 401k, but plan to lower that number to 6% (my company match) and begin investing in an emergency fund.



I know we are better off than a lot of people on this thread. I'm just overwhelmed with what to do. I feel like this is the first time we actually have money to save, pay down debt, and invest with. I'm not sure where to start or the best way to utilize money.

personalfinance,Father's retirement is in annuities? Can anyone help me make sense of this?,"Hi! So I'm trying to learn more about where to keep money for the future. I've started putting my IRA contributions into a Vanguard targeted retirement (VFORX) and I've been throwing any extra money that I don't need into VASGX. I don't really know what I'm doing, but the expense ratio is 0.17% and it tracks the S&amp;P so it's probably not bad!

So I was asking my father what he's been doing with his money. He said he's got it in annuities. **I'm not super clear on what annuities are.** I've read up a bit but all I can gather is that you give someone your money and they let you have a little back each year at a low interest rate? Is that the gist of it? Also it's my understanding that annuities might be good for people who aren't good at managing their money? Do annuities tend to beat inflation?

Anyways he said he's got it with American National Insurance, in the BenchMark 500. **I have a feeling that this is a bad deal** but I'm not sure. Can anyone help give me some perspective? And if this is bad, what should he do? Just stick it all in a Vanguard fund?

If it helps, my father isn't the type of person who spends more than he can afford. I'm not sure how much he has in these annuities, but I'm guessing maybe 2-5 million? Should he get his money out of this ASAP?

I really appreciate the advise and help! Thanks PF!",finance,1396444117

personalfinance,Urge to buy a house every rent increase,"I currently live in an apartment and every year I get the dreaded rent increase. Every year this drives me mad because I struggle internally on what to do. This year the increase is 9% from 763 to 832. If it happens again next year I am over 900 in rent alone. I already plan to negotiate but I am trying to figure out how to deal with this on a deeper level.

A short history, I already owned a house in another state and sold it after 3 years because all the responsibility that comes with maintaining and running a house puts the opportunity cost too high for me. I have a list of startups and ideas I hope to come to fruition but I can only do that with every available second. After selling my house I moved states and rented for a 12 month lease. Got the dreaded rent increase of about the same amount and ended the lease. At this point I looked to purchase a condo (foolish) but it was a steal because the govt was selling it and I would have gained instant $30k equity. Anyway I was not approved because I was self-employed and did not have 2 years worth of income history within the state (had moved 1.5 years prior to this). Went through 3 lenders, offered 40% down and they rejected me in principle (I had 6 years worth if history in the other state, They also didn't like a 1 year gap I had in corporate income when I went to work for a client and thus got paid personally). This kind of put me over the edge and I went backpacking canada for 3 months. Upon returning I signed another lease at a price I am happy with and this is where I am today. 

As far as financials and other details. I am 27, ~$50k cash in savings, $60k in ira/taxable investments, and about $40k self employed corp bank account. I have a stable client now and anticipate a larger then normal amount of income this year. I hope to continue to bring in $4-6k/mo to the corp and my expenses are about 1500/mo. After corp taxes and all that good stuff I can pay the rest as salary. My original goal for this year was to get $100k into my vanguard funds by reducing my savings and contributing some future income. 

As for the housing market, it looks like I could find some move in ready houses between $130-$175k which puts the mortgage around what I am paying now. Some fixer-uppers under that. I have a GF of 5 years who has extra $1k after expenses that currently is not contributing to the housing expense because I told her to use it toward $50k student loan repayment (about 20 months before the bigger private one is paid off, the federal she will probably keep for awhile). If need be she could help contribute to the monthly expense. We have no plans to move anytime soon as my GF just started a new job and we are really enjoying the area. Secondly, she doesn't want to postpone kids past 30 (~3 years) so that would typically ground us a lot longer. I do have an opportunity to move to Australia to work for my client, as much as I would love Australia, working for my client is a means to an end once I can get some other projects off the ground.

I gotta be honest, I hate the system and I'd prefer a way to neither rent nor buy. In a perfect world I would build a tiny house and park it somewhere in the city to have access to all the amenities we enjoy (gym, grocery stores, GF job). If I did have to buy, I would rather do it in all cash just to avoid the system as much as possible. At the same time, rent increases just remind me my money is not working for me and I question everything. Who knows, at some point in the future I may not mind wanting to be a landlord and rent out a few houses, but currently the thought sounds troubling because of the time and energy. 

My hope with this post is to just gain some insight and perhaps some help on how I can stop this cycle of rent, urge to buy, buy or attempt to buy, vacation, repeat. Thank you for reading.

**EDIT** Tried out the rent vs buy calculator just for curiosity sake with the new rent figures and 9% increase. The break even point was year 3 for a lower end house and year 4 for more expensive one. When I start looking at it financially the decision seems simple. 

**TLDR;**
I can afford a house, but I hate owning one. I got rejected by the system previously. I don't like renting either when I get the increase. Renting provides freedom for me to explore my business interests, home ownership would take away from that. However owning is a better long term play, and it appears even in the short-term ($200 more per month to rent vs buy). I am struggling internally with the thought and don't know what direction to go in.",finance,1396451474

personalfinance,"Started grad school, should I keep going?","To make a very long story short, here's the situation: started grad school at a private university close to where I live. With a full time course load I could be done Spring 2016 and go on to a considerable pay raise and job security. However, right as the semester started two things happened: I got pregnant and my part time job cut my hours severely. I was working 32 hours a week, now I'm working 8-16.

Without the editorial about how I feel regarding all of this, I'll just say that these circumstantial changes are making it close to impossible for me to continue in school. My husband works two jobs now and has said that if we cut way, way down I could continue to go to school full time but I would STILL have to work a day or two a week. Our benefits aren't so great either. All of this is making me consider putting school on hold and going back to work for at least a year, putting money away for the time when I am able to return to the masters degree. However, this means that all my loan payments (and I have a lot already, about $30,000 from my first two degrees plus a whopping $20,000 from just this semester alone although in my field I will get federal loan forgiveness after 10 years of repayment). My credit is already garbage. We live in an area with a ridiculous standard of living so even if I go back to work (same field, just with a bachelor's degree) I'll still be making a nice chunk of change.

Bitcoin,The doublespeak of Federal Reserve VP Andolfatto,"A couple days ago, Fed VP David Andolfatto gave a presentation on Bitcoin. It was generally hailed as ""fair and balanced"" by observers.

Yet, we cannot let people in positions of power get away with nonsense such as the following, taken from a Bloomberg article today:

""Andolfatto said today the Fed has provided a fairly stable currency for 100 years and “passed the market test.” The value of Bitcoin is prone to swings because a central authority can’t issue more supply in times when demand for money soars, such as in a financial crisis, he said.""

This is absurd.

First, anyone who thinks the Fed has provided a fairly stable currency for 100 years needs to read this:  http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig10/voorhees1.1.1.html

TLDR - the dollar was stable for 150 years pre-central bank. Then central bank was created ""to stabilize the value of the dollar"" and over the next 100 years the dollar has lost over 96% of its value. That is a big fat fail.

Second, the Fed cannot be said to ""pass the market test"" because it is the antithesis of a market. Central banks are a replacement for the market of money and interest. Central planning by governments is the opposite of markets. The only test the Fed has passed is the scorecard it gives itself.

And third, related to Bitcoin specifically, its volatility is most certainly not due to the inability of a benevolent central bank to to print more of it. Its volatility is due to A) small market size, B) the fact that it's new and experimental and C) a sensationalist narrative.  Time soothes all three of these, and Bitcoin will slowly earn stability in the marketplace (as opposed to achieving it through the coercion of government) .

The dollar's superficial stability (which only appears stable over the short term, as it loses value continually over time) is not due to central bank omnipotence, but rather to market size. And indeed, it was far more stable before the Fed existed (this was mostly due to the ""dollar"" being just the name for an amount of gold). 

Andolfatto is engaged is doublespeak and fallacy, suggesting the opposite of the truth: that money is flawed to the extent it cannot be debased. 

Now that Bitcoin exists, this kind of economic witchcraft will fade, and the world will see which currency is real, and which is virtual.

personalfinance,"Paying down credit cards - Big balance smaller interest, Small balance bigger interest","TLDR; Should I be paying down $4,000 @ 19% APR or $2,700 @ 24%

Quick background.  28 year old making $48,685.  Got myself into some unemployment trouble years ago, wherein I jacked up my credit cards from PIF every month to damn near maxed out.  In turn, my credit went from 750 down to 500 (back to 650 now) and my APR's skyrocketed to max.  Now I'm in a stable job and am looking to get this cleared off in the most efficient way possible.

I have around $400 to put towards these various cards.  As my interest payment is around $50 each, I will try to go for $100 a month each so my credit report shows ""more than min payment"", and will top off to $400 total.  Effectively I'll have an extra $150 to put towards a card using this method.

Is this even an effective method?  Does ""paying more than min payment"" even affect credit score that much?

I know the common rule is to pay down the card with the highest interest rate, but in my situation the card with the highest interest rate has the lowest balance on it.  Here's my breakdown:

A - $4,000 - 19.24%
B - $2,800 - 22.90%
C - $2,700 - 24.24%

I'm sure there's a (relative) simple way to find out what is the most cost effective way of doing this, but if I have $400 a month to put towards one of these cards which one should I be aiming at first?

I used to live in NYC and commute to NJ for work. A few months later, I decided the commute was exhausting and I had moved to NJ for work and residence. 

Now I'm filing my taxes for the first time using Turbo Tax. They're charging me $35 for Federal Basic (I upgrade thinking I needed it but I ended up not needing the Basic edition and could use the free edition). As well as $40 for NJ and $40 for NYC.

Strangely though, they said that NJ requires a mail tax return for part-time nonresidents that live outside of NJ but work in NJ. 
""You have a tax situation in your New Jersey return(s) that requires you to file that return by mail. Click Continue to file and we'll help you with the filing process or visit the Review section for more details.""


Does that mean I still have to pay $40 to Turbo Tax? 

So, now the total is  $114.97!!! Which is about the same amount I would pay an accountant to do my taxes! 

Is there a cheaper alternative for someone with a situation like mine? 

Are the tax refunds really a guarantee on Turbo Tax? Can I do a paper mail tax form for NJ tax to avoid a fee? 


EDIT: Btw, the TurboTax I used above is webbased.

personalfinance,"Update on ""Advice on Building Credit When Uncreditworthy?""","Hi all, sorry in advance for the length, but this is a happy update!

It's been a while since I posted for advice from you guys, and though only a couple people answered before I thought that it would be worth an update.


So to sum up, my mother opened a credit card in my name, was incredibly delinquent on it multiple times, and in the end avoided paying it off properly leaving me with either paying off the balance myself or going through legal routes to have the account declared fraud and have her charged. Because of our relationship, I chose to pay it off myself, but because of such it's stuck on my report and will be for at least 7 years like any other credit issue. It's been causing issues for me, especially since I've been wanting for a while to improve my credit. 


Since the last post, I'd applied to multiple big bank cards. The majority of those cards that I'd applied for were secured, as they seemed to be the only ones that made sense. Most of my applications were online, and for each of those I followed up with the reviewer prior to them sending a response to explain my situation and see if there's any way for me to possibly improve my chances. I also went into my local BoA branch to see if it's possible to get a secured card with them, and was talked into applying for their regular rewards card as well, both to no avail. The responses I got were pretty much all the same; your credit is really bad, you need to build up history, but you can't do it with us because you have no history. I spaced out applications to try to minimize bad effects to my already bad score, but still managed to lower it with the amount of HPs I've had over the last few months. I'd been pretty frustrated, especially considering how financially conscious I am compared to friends who have easily acquired cards; I don't blow money outside reason, and consider savings account deposits to be my second largest bill after rent. I have a bit of a lofty goal for my boyfriend and I to save up 100k by 30, and I alone already have 3k from the last 6 or so months. Long story short, I hadn't been able to do much in the way of getting any company to give me a chance and it'd been blowing my self esteem.


I recently began posting on myFICO to see if I could get more advice on what to do. Someone there mentioned trying a SDFCU, which I hadn't given much thought to before. I looked them up, and found that my college sponsors one and as a student I was eligible to join. I went to the branch today and opened an account there, in addition to speaking to the branch manager about opening a credit card. She was really wonderful and heard me out, looked at what she could do, and was able to get me a card with a $500 limit at their higher interest rate (13.75%) with possiblilty to increase the line and decrease the interest in a year. I'm pretty happy with the development and am really excited to be able to start improving my credit rather than having to have the one and only card in my name be a bad account I had no involvement with. I plan to to only use it to half the limit or less, and am thinking of it like an extension to my debit card; if I don't have the money, I guess I can't get that right now. 


All in all, I just wanted to say thank you to those who gave me advice. Although in the end some things didn't work, the fact that some people answered and tried to help helped me to keep in mind that my situation isn't completely hopeless. In that same vein, people who may be in a similar situation should keep that in mind too; be smart and diligent about trying to take control of your credit, and if the big banks aren't helping, try looking within your community. AMA about the process if you're dealing with similar things too.

Please see my post about my money situation [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/20ltl0/i_think_my_budget_is_ok_but_i_need_help_with/).


When I was 17 I stupidly took out a $700 loan at 33% interest rate with Cash Converters to pay a phone bill because. I had just moved out of home and I was scared to ask my parents for money.


I wasn't working a well paying job at the time and I was very depressed about that. I found it hard to keep up with payments and defaulted a number of times before I paid back the money in full after getting about $1500 back on my tax return. 


Two years after I got a call from debt collectors who said that I had a debt of $1097.00 with Centrelink (government support while I studied). Turns out they had been sending correspondence to my old address as I hadn't updated my details due to not needing the payments anymore. I sorted out a payment plan and paid $35 a week and then upped it to $50 per week and paid it off in less than six months. As far as I am aware the Centrelink debt does not affect my credit score.


At the moment I just got my licence and I want to but my first car, I am well on my to saving about $1000.00 and I went to apply for a loan of $5000.00 car is around $6000 and I was rejected, twice at two different banks. 


I have no credit cards, or any existing debts, only prevoius debts that seem to be haunting me.


Can anyone shed some light on the situation or give me some tips on how I can improve my credit? 


Any help would be much appreciated.


Thanks so much :)


Edit: Note about Cash Converters, I took a $700 loan from them, but every time you default on a payment they add $60 to your debt, so I was sinker quicker than I was swimming and when I paid it off after  I got my tax refund I paid $990.00 to finalize my account.

 * Coinpunk - an iOS wallet system that doesn't require appstore and works no anyone's phone.  A commercial venture could be spun out of this (licensing the tech from Kyle perhaps).
 * BankToTheFuture - A way of investing in bitcoin startups in the UK
 * Payment systems - Stripe are on board, but there are a multitude of others out there small and large who could be convinced to try it with some funding behind them.

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 86 - The Sweet Spot,"Hey all! GoodShibe here!

For those wondering what's going on with our valuation, well, let's just say that things are a bit crazy over at Uncle Bitcoin's right now and that's having a notable effect on pretty much everyone.

Remember all those investors who bought Bitcoin just to be rich?  And the Miners who jumped aboard and mined in massive numbers in order to become easy millionaires?

Well, a good chunk of them are fleeing for the hills right now thanks to a couple revelations that are, well, hitting kind of hard.

1. The US's taxation rules on Cryptocurrency, if I understand them properly, have spooked a whole lot of people.  The idea that the IRS has made taxation retroactive, that you have to account for the coins that you had, the price you paid when you got them, and then have to pay taxes on based on whatever the price was when you sold... yeah, that's spooked a whole lot of investors.  For Miners, it's even worse because all that mining, well, it's now classified as straight-up income and you're required to claim the coins you mined, at the price they were when you mined them, as income.  Essentially: a whole lot of people just realized they owe a whole lot in taxes, are liquidating Bitcoin to pay said taxes and causing a sort of 'run on the bank', which is dropping Bitcoin's price.  People are now selling faster than they're buying and... needless to say, that's causing a lot of investors to bug out too.

2. The China 'ban' idea just won't go away.  Bitcoiners have been hurt, repeatedly, by China and it seems that even the threat of China 'banning' Bitcoin has people heading for the door.  No one's sure if it will actually happen, but it's contributing to the fire sale on Bitcoin right now.

So, where do we fit into all of this?

Actually, quite well, if we play our cards right.

See, Dogecoin has always been intended - as our Creator stated from the very beginning - for small purchases, for internet tipping, for shows of appreciation.  As a coin, we were made inflationary in order to help reinforce this idea.  There will be no limit to the amount of Dogecoins in existence - and this will help to keep our 'price' low for all.

We're not an 'investor' coin -- and that sweet spot, those $5-$10 purchases, that's where we rule.  

Especially when we get into 'tax land'.  See, the Government doesn't care about small purchases like this.  We're not laundering money in $5 pizza slices and $10 videogame subscriptions.

If you're an American all you have to do is this: Keep track of how much Dogecoin you bought, at what price.  If you sell it at a loss, you can claim that loss as a capital loss.  If you sell at a profit, you pay tax on that profit.

It's a bit of legwork, but not that difficult.

Thing is that for a lot of US-based Bitcoin businesses, especially ones that've already spent a lot of Bitcoin getting up and running, it's sort of like the cows are coming home to roost.  It's a lot of taxes.

And the US's move is, generally, being seen by the market as a way to try and limit or kill off Cryptos in general.  The average person does not want to deal with more taxes, they don't want to be tracking how much comes in and how much goes out at what price.  So these taxation moves are generally viewed as the US's push to keep Bitcoin (and altcoins) as niche products.

The general feeling over in Bitcoin-land is that the move is geared to push Bitcoin out as a 'fad', like beanie babies.  And, largely, it seems like those plans are working.

For the rest of the world, if you're not Russia, China, the US or Canada then just proceed as normal (though probably good, just for self-edification, to start tracking stuff like this).  Canada has already come out and stated that Cryptos are considered Commodities and are taxable, so I'm sure this all comes as no real shock to Canadians.

If we REALLY want to do something good, let's make some software that helps Shibes (and Bitcoiners and...) keep track of their buy-in prices, etc.

I can't remember if the QT wallet has a 'history' feature that tracks all your incoming/outgoing coins (I know for sure it's at least the last 3 or 4 transactions) but that can also help you track your purchases, etc.

The long and short of it breaks down like this:

Your Government wants their cut of the action.  For Bitcoin, there's a lot of action that they missed, and now they are saying that they want their cut retroactively.

But for us, doing what we were doing anyway, for small purchases, transfers, etc, Dogecoin continues, pretty much, as business as usual.  

We're not exactly buying Tesla Roadsters here.

That said, as an 'investment vehicle', well, things just got a lot more restrictive. You can 'invest' in Dogecoin (or any digital coin) hoping to profit off its rise, but, if you do, you have to pay taxes on your profits.  Most don't like that.  But, if you want to do business in the US and Canada, those are the new rules. And, yes, you can choose not to follow them, but it will sting if you get caught.

Again, for most of us, the average user, this won't affect us much other than chasing out those who don't care about the community we've built here.

And for Bitcoin, this exodus may lead to a renaissance for them as well - as all the speculators and Libertarians and such tuck tail and run for the door, leaving only the true-believers to pick up the pieces.

But this should surprise no one.

Regulation was always on it's way in - the Wild West eventually got tamed.

Yes, much of the 'wild profits' of the early days are gone - and the 'wild profits' to come will be taxable (technically, those original 'wild profits' are now taxable as well...) - but for those of us who wanted Dogecoin to exist as a *currency*, to do what it does best, this really isn't much for us to bat an eye at.

Keep tipping, keep mining, keep appreciating one another. 

Keep on building the DOGEconomy.

Because the moon is still in full view, my friends. 

And it beckons for those who dare.

It's 8:07AM EST and we're at 66.78% of DOGEs found.  Our Global Hashrate is on the rise from ~68 to ~73 Gigahashes per second and our Difficulty is bouncing between ~734 and ~1890 -- currently riding very high at ~1890.

As always, I appreciate your support!

GoodShibe

**EDIT**: In case you missed it, we have a Celebrity AMA coming up, specifically working in a Dogecoin/charity angle. I can't say who it is, but they'll be here hoping to collect Dogecoin donations for a charity called [Operation Smile](http://www.operationsmile.org/).  More to come soon!  You can check out the update thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogecoin_PR/comments/222asb/update_celebritycharity_campaign/)

**EDIT 2**: I may be wrong here, but the way it seems to me is:

* DOGE-to-DOGE transactions, the US Government doesn't care.  You're not touching their currency.

* DOGE to USD is where they want to know what's what.

* Not sure how that accounts for buying things in DOGE directly but I suspect it might just be when the seller converts to USD (which wouldn't effect you).

Internal Revenue Service 
Attn: CC:PA:LPD:PR (Notice 2014-21)

I'd like to comment publicly on the recent IRS Notice 2014-21 from March 25, 2014 regarding virtual currencies, where it is described that ""For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property.""

The IRS in this notice has defined this class of financial instrument as ""virtual currency,"" but is instead paradoxically treating it as property. The inherent design of the Bitcoin protocol is to facilitate a means of currency between two parties. A subsequent use of the protocol can be used for trading bitcoins between parties, but this is not the intended or primary purpose. 

By classifying Bitcoin as property, every time a person makes a transaction, it would possibly mean a taxable event, creating a nightmare of paperwork for both Bitcoin users and the IRS, and requiring the procedure to keep track of every single purchase and report it to the IRS. It is not reasonable to expect record keeping for every single transaction and realized taxable event. 

Bitcoin is a technology that can provide a basis for new shared payments and transfer system using existing currencies and securities. Bitcoin was designed to be a system that can reduce systemic costs, and provide faster, secure, transfers – particularly internationally. By classifying Bitcoin as property, the IRS will stifle innovation and adoption in and around the Bitcoin protocol, and its intended use. 


It is important to apply the same tax policy as currency holds. I consider treating Bitcoin as property as unreasonable, and I am asking you to respectfully reconsider your decision.
 
Sincerely,

I'm currently paying down about $30K in debt and am wondering if it makes financial sense to stop contributing to my 401k so I have more dough to throw at debt. I'm nervous about losing out on the employer match of 6% but perhaps I'm losing more by not paying off my debt as quickly as I could be with the help of what's currently going towards retirement. 

I am aggressively paying off debt, attacking high interest rates first. (I am aware of the snowball method but I'm really motivated to continue attacking debt this way.)

My debt is mostly credit cards and is broken down as follows:

$7582 at 13.24%

$9945 at 10.24%

$5410 at 7.15%

$4874 at 4.99%

$3384 at 2.88% (this last figure is for student loans)

I have about $215 pre-tax taken out of each paycheck for 401k right now. Am I correct in figuring that freezing contributions will free up about $288 per month for me to put towards debt? Should I do this? Using debt reduction calculators, I should pay off my debt completely in about two years (it will probably be a bit less than that). If my calculation of $288 is correct, I think this will shave four months off of that payback period.

Didn't get into it, but I'm contributing around $100/month to my ESPP, too. Suspend?

Thank you so very much for your help!",finance,1396544973
Bitcoin,Community Freebie! The Bitcoin Revolution: Where It Came From &amp; Where It May Lead,"I know how much you guys love free things so I've decided to make my latest publication, **The Bitcoin Revolution: Where It Came From &amp; Where It May Lead**, completely and absolutely free!

This project is the culmination of several late nights spend writing, researching, and forecasting what the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may hold. My intention is to help newcomers and intermediate users of digital currencies alike to improve their understanding and adoption of this amazing technology. I am excited to release this product to the public and I hope many knowledgeable people in the community dive into this manuscript and take the opportunity to either tear it apart (critical reviews) and/or join me in writing publications (fellow contributors) in order to send a strong message to regulators, adopters, and investors. I hope to use this book to serve as a marketing tool for the exchange and cold storage services we are currently developing as well as increase the number of speaking engagements in the industry I have.

**Description:**

*Bitcoin — that strange algorithmic creation sweeping the nations in its bid to become the new official digital replacement for “fiat” cash, coins, checks and cards — is the hottest subject in discussion circles ranging from economic pundits to technology advocates. In 2013 the digital currency began trading at $10 and by November, was selling for upwards of $1200 a pop. What will 2014 bring for this bold new design of money?*

*With experts calling bitcoin the greatest innovation since the internet itself, it is a topic most will want to familiarize themselves with if they are to keep pace in a world of blurring technological advancement. The Bitcoin Revolution shows, step-by-step, how this concept of money operates, where it came from, and what the future might hold for decentralized finance and the incredible, even chaotic, scenarios it may bring.*

* “You can’t stop things like Bitcoin. It will be everywhere and the world will have to readjust. World governments will have to readjust” – John McAfee, Founder of McAfee

* “I do think Bitcoin is the first [encrypted money] that has the potential to do something like change the world.” – Peter Thiel, Co-Founder of Paypal

* “[Virtual Currencies] may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” – Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve

personalfinance,Problems with state tax W2's,"My fiance is behind about 3 years in her tax returns. She's done really good and obtained the info and filed the federal returns, and those are accepted and final, but cannot file the state returns because she is missing the W2's. 

She has tried requesting them from the employer, this worked for a few, but most refused and referred her to the IRS or the state. The IRS does not record the state taxes paid. The states refuse to help her, telling her to go to her employer. It's a circle.

The two states are New Mexico and Colorado. One of the former employers is ""former"" due to their abusive employee policies, and is of outright no help. Nothing short of a court order will get them to help.

The SSA can send a report, $38 for each employer and year, there are about 6. We just can't do that, its too much money, cumulatively. 

Everything she does is a circle, it seems it takes a masters in government administration just to do this.

She really doesn't owe the state any money, this is just returns to get current and maybe recover the small amount of overpayment.

Any ideas? There has to be a easier way. Really, all she needs is the dollars paid in state taxes, the rest I think we can figure out.",finance,1396548930

personalfinance,Sell or Rent - looking for input,"I'm in Virginia.

Closing on a new home in about a month.  Our current residence is underwater with a $104k balance and a likely value of about $75k (a friend of mine is an appraiser).  We took on that mortgage in 2006 at a 6% interest rate.

Option 1:  We have the cash to sell the property and cover the loss.  So that's one option, and we would simply be done with the property.

Option 2:  Keep the property and convert it to a rental.  Our current mortgage is $930/month (including taxes/insurance/pmi).  We could likely rent it out for $800-$850 (again, appraiser friend is the source on this).

Option 2a:  Rent it for what we can get and eat the rest.  Hope that values rise enough that we can eventually either sell it for less of a loss or perhaps break even.

Option 2b:  Put $30k into a refinance at current rates and bring the monthly payment down to about $450 (including taxes/insurance).

personalfinance,"Need help determining how to spend car insurance pay-out: toward other debt, new car, etc?","I'll try to keep this as quick and easy as possible.

I'll say that after taxes from both (and health insurance deductions from my paycheck), my husband and I net about $3900 from our combined salaries each month.
We own a house and pay $1100/month for mortgage. I'd say our utilities average $400/month (cell phones, gas, electric, sewer, water, internet). $180/month for car insurance. $260/month on car gas. $600/month on food. After some other expenses like medication, cat food and litter, toiletries, occasional bar nights, etc, let's say $2900 of that is claimed on normal items/expenditures.
I just paid off my school loans, my husband has none, so, no school loans factor into this.
I havean '02 Honda Accord and that is paid off.
I have a credit card balance of exactly $4800 (at 22% interest, I know I know).
Husband's credit card balance is about $5800 (with something like 4-5% interest, I think?)
(So, mortgage and two credit cards are the only debt factoring into our lives at the moment)
We have only about $2500 in savings.

You see, two weeks ago my husband's car ('07 Honda Accord EX) was stolen and totaled. We were just three months away from paying off the balance of that car loan, but, our insurance company fronted that to be able to take ownership of the car. For me and my husband, our plan was to be car-loan-free until either/both cars fell apart and we were forced to get a new one(s).

The car insurance settlement comes to $9030 after our deductible and the remainder of the loan balance. So, question is, how do we use that money? We are pondering several options:


1) Do we put nearly the entire insurance pay-out toward a newerish car (holding aside about $1200 for sales tax and titling/registration fees) and take out a loan on any remaining balance (so, look at a replacement Honda in the $16,000 range, put $8000 down and do a loan for $8000 hopefully around 3% interest?)


2) Try to find an older used car (something ticketed around $10,000) and haggle with the dealership to around $8500-$9000 and cover it all ""with cash"" using the insurance pay-out, then pay outta pocket for the sales tax?


3) Put some money towards my credit card  balance (since it has the highest interest rate), some towards a used car downpayment, and get a loan for the balance of the car?


4) Is there another better option we haven't thought of?


Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. And of course if you need more info from me, feel free to ask questions and I'll try my best to answer. In advance, thank you for any help you can provide.

Edited to say: the goal was for us to really start tackling our credit card debt and build up savings with the unspent money each month, and I'd really like that to be a focus going forward here, too, if that helps any.",finance,1396554592

Computer's don't do incorrect account linkages, they do what they are programmed to do or what humans direct them to do.

This was an incorrect account linkage at the direction of a person(s) not following proper procedures, right ?

The error (incorrect account linkage) was caused by someone's laziness, lack of details or lack of proper training, by not taking the time to do it correctly.

Also, how about the lack of professionalism by employees: no return calls after multiple requests, the run around and no follow-up?

I’m amazed at TDBank’s ever ceasing attempts to skirt the simple, plain, truths when it comes to admitting their mistake(s), TDBank must consider themselves MUCH TOO BIG to really have to care.

Examples of valid excuses,
 - an intern didn’t follow procedure,
 - an intern wasn’t properly supervised,
 - an intern wasn’t cut out for the job,
 - the manager was lazy/didn’t care/wasn’t cut out for the job/didn’t know etc.
 - there was no procedure, nobody knew what to do, or how to go about it, Etc.

What TDBank could have done,
“ TDBank is very sorry for the mistake (see 10+ excuses above) that we caused. Thank goodness you are a nobody, not important, nobody cares about you, you can be ignored and pushed aside.

Can you imagine what would have happened, if it were somebody important, thank you for the opportunity to have been made aware of our shortcomings and save us some real embarrassment at some later time?? “

What TDBank should have done,
“As a token of our remorse, we would like to offer you something appropriate, like a token gift to your favorite charity”.

My part,
 “TDBank, thank you for your frank, swift action, I accept your offer to donate to my favorite charity “St. Jude - Children's Research Hospital”.”

Bitcoin,What a deflationary currency would mean for loans. We need to clear up some rampant misconceptions...,"There seems to be a big misconception about loans and deflationary currencies that needs to be cleared up.

At the moment, it's impossible to take any sort of long-term loan in BTC because the value is too unstable. However, the fact that it's deflationary *does not* disqualify it from being usable in long-term contracts! Once the price stabilizes, you *will* be able to take out a mortgage or business loan in BTC.

People seem to think that a ""negative interest rate"" means that no one will ever loan out BTC. One redditor put it to me with this brilliant insight: ""Is 1BTC is always more than 0.95BTC? The answer is yes. So why would you ever issue that loan? Come on, engage your fucking brain."" Clearly some of us *do* need to engage our brains...

Just because 1 &gt; .9 does not mean that 1 BTC *now* will be worth more that .9 BTC *in the future*. It is only because we have 'inflationary' currency deeply ingrained into our thoughts that getting back less in the future seems wrong. It may seem that the lender ""isn't getting rewarded for taking a risk"". However, a deflationary currency *would be worth more in the future*. Perhaps the deflationary increase in value won't be enough to cover the risk, and so the return might be near-zero or positive, but it suffices to say that, if a 5% rate is fair with a currency at 3% deflation, then a -1% loan might be fair for a currency at -3% inflation. The lender is making 2% in both cases to cover his risk.

If your feeble brain is still having trouble parsing this, consider that 10000 BTC was worth 1 pizza three years ago. At -5% interest, a borrower would have to return over 8000 BTC now to cover a loan on 10000 BTC from 3 years ago. How many pizzas would you be able to buy with 8000 BTC today? Are more pizzas more than less pizzas? The answer is yes.

So, my fellow Bitcoiners, please take note that a deflationary currency can be used for loans, and that if someone says that BTC can't be used for long-term contracts, they are correct but only because of the high volatility which I'm sure will one day be gone.

personalfinance,Another quick question about student loans vs retirement,"Hey everyone!

I was on here a few weeks ago asking about opening a retirement account vs putting money at student loans and I'm back looking for some clarification.

Much of the advice seemed to be any employer match first, followed by student loans, then additional retirement funds. I've been following that advice, adding another 100 or so a month to my loan payment. But then I had a thought today and was wondering- doesn't compounding make my retirement contributions now more important over the long term? Or is this a matter of risk- the guaranteed return on student loans vs the riskier returns/losses from the market?

For context my take home pay is about 1420/month, housing, utilities, and some food are provided by my employer, and I owe about 16k in Federal Direct loans with payments coming to 167 and change per month. Only 2 of these loans (amounting to about 7k) are over 5% (5.75/5.35 respectively) and they are my smallest loans (one 3300-ish one under 3700), with the other two (amounting to just over 8k, one 4300ish and the other at 4000-ish) at 4.25 and 3.15 respectively. 

It just seems like the extra 1500 in savings calculators are saying I'd get from paying them off early is a lower value than the potential compounding snowball of retirement contributions.

On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve published its annual bank capital plan review that saw the North American businesses of Citigroup, HSBC, RBS and Santander all rejected for what it said were “qualitative concerns”.

This morning, the Bank of England’s [Financial](http://corlissonlinegroup.com/) Policy Committee (FPC) released a statement from its latest meeting in which it warned obtusely that “changes to the structure and functioning of markets as banks adapted business models to the aftermath of the financial crisis” meant it had become more difficult to assess the impact of “unexpected developments from any source”.

What the Fed and the Bank both appear to be saying is that big banks remain too complex and that changes made to financial and bank regulation since the crash in 2008 have resulted in the job of assessing systemic risk becoming much harder.

(Health professional (2 years) + PhD (3-4 years) + health professional (2 years) = 7-8 years)

I currently  have 4 loans of varying interest rates that I had to take out to pay for the first 2 years of my program, but will be transitioning to the PhD program next year and I will be receiving a stipend (salary) rather than having to take out loans.  After completing the PhD I will return to the Health degree and be responsible for the 3rd years tuition/fees (roughly 33k) and have my 4th year paid for by the school.

Loan B: 35,000, 6.8%

Loan C: 6,100, 6.41%

Loan D: 6,600, 7.9%

A: Pay down on highest interest loan(s) with the PhD stipend, and then take out another student loan to complete my 3rd year of health professions program.

I eventually want to buy, but I'm weary of rushing into something prematurely.  I feel like I'm paying too much in rent now, so buying could make more sense financially, but I know there are tons of hidden costs associated with buying that aren't present when renting.  My apartment lease ends in January 2015, so if I'm going to buy, I'd like to get started with the process in May or June 2014.  Relevant stats are below:

**Background:**

*27 year old male, engaged to 28 year old female.   Essentially married for all intents and purposes, except in a legal sense (just haven't had time to actually plan the wedding).

*No kids.  Neither of us desire kids in the future (though if they happen unintentionally, we're okay with that).

*Currently live in a high cost of living area right outside of DC in Northern Virginia.  We desire to stay in the area, preferably inside the beltway if we can do it.  We'd consider moving a small distance outside of the beltway, but living in a walkable community with good access to bike routes is a huge deal for us (we're both cyclists).  

**Assets:**

*Checking account = Less than $1,000 

*Savings account yielding 0.87% = $90,000

*Brokerage account = $24,000

*401(k) account = $94,000

*2007 Honda Accord, owned outright.  72,000 miles on it, so I’m hoping it'll last for many years to come.  

**Liabilities:**

*Discover card used for general living expenses.  Always paid in full every month.  

*Fiancee's student loans = $10,000 remaining @ 5.0% (she's paying about $800/month on these, so this should be gone soon).

*No other debt

**Income:**

*My base salary = $115,000 before tax

*My annual bonus = Varies based on both mine and the company's performance, but was $16,000 last year before tax.

*Fiancee’s salary = $40,000 before tax

**Expenses:**

*Rent+Utilities = $1,725 / month

*Food+Entertainment = $500 / month

*Cell Phones = $150 / month

*Cable+Internet = $110 / month

*Gas = $50 / month

*Eventual marriage.  No family assistance expected (financially), so we'd need to foot the whole thing ourselves (maybe $15,000-20,000?)

*Other miscellaneous expenses when incurred.  I'm not as good at tracking expenses as I should be.

**Questions:**

*Biggest question: Should we buy a house now, or should we wait to let our financial situation mature for a few more years?

*Housing costs are really expensive in our area.  Inside the beltway in Virginia, $500,000 barely gets a beat-up single family home built in the 1940s.  The better homes are in the $600,000 to $700,000 range.  We can get newer/bigger homes the further away from the city we live, but at some point, it becomes a quality of life thing.  Is living inside the beltway realistic for us?

*We're primarily looking for single family homes, but we could be okay with a townhouse as well.  We absolutely want to avoid condos.  While the majority of our neighbors are great, we've had some terrible experiences, so we'd like to avoid shared walls to the extent possible. Is a single family home ideal, or would we be better suited in a townhouse?

*I eventually intend to use my liquid assets (i.e., excluding the 401(k) and the car) for a down payment on a house.  Currently, only 20% of that sum is exposed to market risk.  The rest is sitting in a risk free savings account. Am I a fool to be investing any portion in the markets?  Am I a fool for earning such a small rate on the money in the savings account?  What's the proper allocation here?  Obviously, I don't want to have to realize capital losses when buying the house, but I'm comfortable with some amount of risk.  Worst case scenario, if the markets tank right when we're looking to buy, we can rent for another couple of years.  

*Interest rates are really low right now, so I'm worried that, if we don't act soon, we'll just end up getting a loan with a higher rate and end up paying more out of pocket.  Is that a realistic concern, and if so, what's the best way to manage my interest rate risk?

*Should I be maxing out the 401(k) to the $17,500 limit for 2014?  So far, I've been putting in a smaller amount so that I have more liquid cash for a potential down payment.  I've been contributing roughly $13,000 or so in each of the last few years.  Contributing to the limit would be relatively easy, but I’d have less available for a down payment.

*The credit limit on the Discover card is only $3500.  Should I apply for different credit cards with higher limits to help reduce my utilization ratio, or would the hard inquiries and reduced average age reduce the overall score?

*Given our income disparity (as well as the cost of the marriage itself), does marriage make financial sense from a tax perspective?  We fully intend on spending the rest of our lives together, but we both view marriage as a somewhat outdated tradition, so we're okay with staying single in the eyes of the government if it's advantageous to us financially.  We'll probably still have a wedding ceremony regardless though, mostly because of family/friend's expectations and because weddings are a ton of fun.   

**Other Considerations:**

*I love DC, but I'm not sure if I want to stay here for the rest of my life.  Buying a house really limits my options.  My career is in a fairly niche field.  There are only a handful of employers in most cities, so there's a real possibility that, if I want to take another job, I'd have to move to a different city.  I recently received my credentials in that field, meaning that I'm getting calls/emails from recruiters for different jobs almost daily.  I'm generally happy in my current job, so I'm not looking to move just yet, but if the right offer comes across, I'd be willing to take it.  

*Credit = Mine is good, fiancee's is pretty bad (although she’s working on it).  I’m assuming any mortgage would need to be in my name only.   

*We only have one car, which is all we need in our current living situation.  I plan to drive this car until it dies, but eventually, we'll need to replace it.  We might need a second car at some point as well.",finance,1396615923

economy,Wall Street upbeat after jobs data comes in below expectations,"Wall Street looks poised for all time highs today, after the monthly jobs data once again come in below expectations. 

http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/53214/wall-street-upbeat-after-jobs-data-53214.html

Why? Well, for a number of reasons.

First of all, **Wall Street LOVES a slack labor market**, because that means they can fire people who ask for a raise, or time off, or any other increase in benefits. You can't do that in a tight labor market. Secondly, it means that **they do not have to share their profits with their workers**. If the company increases sales by 10%, because the workers are producing more, that simply means the fat cats get fatter, and the workers get nothing! If you own stock in a company, this should make you downright giddy! (If you work for one of these companies this means you will be producing more , for the same or less pay....don't feel bad, however.. that's what we call ""productivity"".. so, you should be glad to know your ""productivity"" is rising! Yay for you!)

And finally, a weak job market in an election year means **the Federal Reserve will continue to print money and use it to buy US Treasury and mortgage bonds. This is done specifically to boost the stock market (also known as ""asset prices"").** The mechanism explaining how this works is complicated but in a nutshell, it can be explained like this: When the Fed prints money to buy Treasury Bonds, it buys those bonds from institutions like banks who currently own bonds. This has the effect of ""flushing"" cash in to the system. Banks typically put that cash to work in the stock market... secondly, it keeps interest rates low, making investments that pay interest less attractive...so, that causes money to flow to the stock market..

So, anyway.... in summary.. REJOICE America.. the economy still stinks, and that means new all time highs in the stock market should be right around the corner.

personalfinance,Best place to put emergency fund to maximize interest?,"Hi Reddit! I'm financially satisfied in the second year of my post-masters job. I'm using this time to have fun and build savings for my future. 

Not sure if it matters, but here are my details:

29 y/o American female, 51K/year salary

Take-home pay (after taxes/12% to 403b): About $2600/month

Rent/Utilities: $800
Student loan: $515 (after consolidation &amp; income-based repayment)
Food/groceries: $500 (I'm a foodie and enjoy restaurants and cooking)
To emergency fund: $550
The remaining $235 is other/discretionary spending. (the usual: movies, fun, the occasional taxi, phone).

I personally think my finances are in good order, and though I have a lot of student loan debt (just under 70k at 6.5%) I'm a candidate for the public service forgiveness program, which will forgive my remaining balance after 10 years.

I also have about 2K in a mutual fund that I hope to add to later; that isn't my focus right now.

So, my question is about my emergency fund. I currently have $9K in a savings account, which is where my $550 goes each month. My interest rate is .01% which is basically nothing. I know I should fix this, or my money will lose value as I'm actively saving. So, what should I do?


TL;DR

 I have $550 that I put into my emergency savings each month. My interest rate with my bank is incredibly low. Where should I put this money to keep it safe and maximize my interest rate?",finance,1396629915
financialindependence,Please critique my plan for after graduation,"First I want to thank all the contributors here. FIRE was not something I was aware was possible until the last few months and has drastically changed the way I have approached my life and finances. I am currently 28 years old and I have developed a plan for my first year after graduation which I believe maximizes tax incentives and retirement contributions. Since I am still new to understanding the finer points of tax and finance, I ask for a critique on my plan or any additions I can make.

My current living situation is $600/mo rent and utilities, $500/mo car payment and insurance, ~ $400 gas and groceries, $200 a month misc. Rounded up I live on &lt; or = $25k a year. I am graduating from a Physician Assistant program in May, and will be staying in the same living situation after graduation. My biggest change will be ditching my newer car for something more affordable and better on fuel. I am very aware that area needs major overhauling. I am not in a situation where I can bike, as I will be commuting to three different cities after graduation, all roughly a 20-25 minute drive from my central location.

My biggest issue I am facing is my student loan situation. I will owe $148k upon graduation, which I will need to being paying in May. Interest rates vary from 5.6-7.9%. My payment come January 2015 will be roughly 1600'ish a month. The positive is I have secured 3 positions for after school beginning in July. One is M-F, no weekends, no holidays, $100k salary. I also picked up a part time/ per diem position which guarantees me every other Sunday for an additional $17k a year. I also have a third per diem position which will be 1-3 days a month, picking up holidays and vacations. I am estimating I should gross roughly $130k my first full year.

Now the pay is all well and good until I realized I will be losing some tax incentives, including student loan interest write offs. I will also be losing the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA. My plan to battle this is as follows:
First year, this July to Dec, I should make roughly 55-60k. This will leave me able to still claim student loan interest. I am planning on making a lump payment of 2500 (the max student loan interest deductible) against my interest before it capitalizes. This way I can at least write off the interest for one year and lower the amount of capitalized interest I have. I also plan on using the $2000 lifetime learning credit as well.
In terms of retirement investing... I plan on contributing enough to get my match out of my 403b this year and investing 5500 into a roth IRA. Next year, I will max out my 403 b contribution to 17500, allowing me to hopefully bring my MAGI under 114000 to be able to contribute the max to the Roth IRA again. I will continue this year after year until I am no longer able to get my MAGI down low enough to contribute to the Roth. 
In terms of the student loans... Once I build up a $10k emergency fund, everything extra I have will be going to paying the loans off. I am not consolidating them, so that I may target one loan off at a time, paying them off and lowering the overall payment as I go. 
I am currently renting half a duplex and am hoping to purchase it from my landlord. This is currently a hope, not a solid thing, but I am looking into it as a form of passive incomes.

So I see the breakdown my first full year as- $25k to live, ~$20k in student loan payments, $5500 in Roth contributions. 
My take home pay should be roughly ~$70k after a $17,500 403b contribution. This should leave me with enough to get out of my car loan (I am a bit upside down by around $2k), buy a decent used $10k car and have enough to put aside a $10k emergency fund.  
Once the car is purchased and emergency fund established, that $20k the next year will be all excess to pay my loans down as quickly as possible.

Please, any critique to the plan would be greatly appreciated. If there is anyway to maximize my savings, tax write offs, etc that I am missing, I am all ears. I have been with my girlfriend for quite some time and we are not planning a family anytime soon, she still has 1 year in the PA program I am graduating from. That being said, the idea of being able to work part time and be home with my children someday is huge to me, as my father was an on the road truck driver who was never home.

Ladies and Gentleman, what we have here is a whole lot of idiocy mixed in with unmedicated mental illness that led to moronic decisions. However, medication has been administered and my less PTSD addled brain sees how much of an emergency my financial state is in. If you were in my shoes, aside from jumping from the nearest building, what would you tackle first? I'm open to any suggestions. I know what things you'll tell me to get rid of but I'm the type of person that NEEDS to hear what I already know from someone else. My current plan I have developed has me debt free by Nov. 30, 2017 but I want to hear how someone else would dig themselves out of this because I've looked at it all so many times I can't really see all of the angles. I have redone my plan so many times I have many different versions of it: building emergency fund first, attacking low balances first, and attacking high interest rates first and all sorts of hybrid methods. I just need a fresh perspective.  

Thank you for reading.

personalfinance,"If you currently made $89,000 a year, would it make financial sense to reject a promotion to $91,000?","Lets assume that you are living the in U.S. as a single individual in a state that does not charge personal income tax.  It is my understanding that if you make between $36,900 to $89,350, the federal government places you in a tax bracket of 25%.  If you make between $89,350 to $186,350, you are in a tax bracket of 28%.  

So the person who makes $89k a year has a take home pay of $66,750 while the promotion to $91k reduces the yearly take home pay to $65,520.  

Is this correct?  Would it be beneficial for the individual to deny this promotion? Does the individual who now makes $91k receive a tax return at the end of the year that is greater than the difference in take home pay and tax return amount of the $88k salary?  Could someone explain this to me?",finance,1396672906
personalfinance,Wife has horrible credit (sub 450). Where to start?,"Basically what the title says. We are in the process of trying to figure out how bad it is (she has basically turned a blind eye to it, out of sight out of mind). But I know her credit score is sub 450.



Among some of the things contributing:

-Around $20000 unpaid student loans (in default)

-Around $5000 unpaid credit card debt

-Probably $3000 in unpaid bills

-Got a final warning on car payment (one month away from repo).

-Probably some others she has forgotten about




Luckily I have a good credit score (above 750) so usually I end up signing alone on items (all the credit cards are in my name, our cars are in my name). I'm afraid that when we go to buy a house, they will look at joint credit and give a terrible interest rate because of this. So any advice on where to start? 


I've thought about getting myself credit card in her name so it will help her score when we pay it off every month (this debt is from before we met 10+ years ago and she has since become more responsible, but I still manage all our finances). Other thoughts, consolidate debts and begin making small payments, but I'm not sure where to begin.


Does it hurt to let the debt stagnate for the next 2 years while I pay mine off? Is bankruptcy an option at this point? What are the ramifications of this?",finance,1396682860

dogecoin,Bitcoin's lost it. Dun goofed.,"This is my rant against Bitcoin and the users of Bitcoin. I'm posting this here because I love the Dogecoin community, and warning you guys to prevent Dogecoin from turning into what Bitcoin has become. 

I posted www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/229cu4/bitcoin_will_fail_and_youll_be_responsible_for_it at /r/Bitcoin. No one really read it though. 

I got some Bitcoin last year. Why? Because it was a freaking revolution. I could transfer money to anyone, anywhere in literally seconds, without paying crazy fees to some shit company. I had power over my money, and not anyone else did. 

People have messed up Bitcoin by treating it as an investment, as a ""property"". It is not a property. It is not the ""gold of 21st century"". It's a currency. It's supposed to be collected and spent, not preserved forever. Plus Bitcoin just can't stop the bad news from coming in, and they're hardly making an effort to do any good. Why? Because all they care is about USD. They want to see their USD grow. 

It's shameful how people are switching to technology in every way. Books are being replaced by eBooks. Why? Because they're better. You can load thousands of books in that small device. 

Telephones are being replaced by smartphones? Why? Because they are portable, they are efficient. 

Every sector is seeing an upgrade. Then why not money? Why does money have to be so backward? Why do we still resort to USD? Is everyone such a big fan of Benjamin Franklin? 

I am selling away my Bitcoins in a few hours. I was considering to sell them, but then I thought *Dude you're going against your own talks. Going back to USD when you're trying to convince everyone not to.* So I'm considering to turn them into Dogecoin.",cryptocurrency,1396703259

personalfinance,"Pay mortgage off, or not?","I've been torn over this for quite a while now and I'm hoping that the good folks here can offer some advice or insight.

I'm mid-30s, married, with two kids, 2 and 6.  I've been extremely lucky to have the opportunity to go overseas and work for a couple of years. After selling off most of our assets to break our Canadian residency, we've succesfully relocated to the Middle East.  We've been pretty diligent about keeping lifestyle in check, and are fortunate that our only debt is a mortgage on our home.

Here are the relevant figures, all in Canadian dollars:

Assets:

* House, single family, worth roughly $500K
* RRSP, invested in ETFs, $185K
* RESPs for the kids, $2500
* Emergency fund, $20K
* Cash on hand, $55K

Liabilities:

* Mortage, $375K, variable rate, 2.85% currently, coming up for renewal in 2016

Income:

* $280K employment income
* $20K / year rental income in Canada (after tax)

It's worth noting that I've now used all of my remaining RRSP contribution room from our past years, and can't add any more as we are now non-resident.

The dilemma I have now: do I just focus all of our income into paying down the mortgage, with the intent of paying it off in full once it comes up for renewal?  Or do I keep making the minimum payment, and invest this extra money where it can grow a little more than ~3%?  There is a part of me that would love to not have to worry about mortgage payments, but I read a lot of blogs and articles that suggest paying off a mortgage right now with interest rates this low is foolish.

Neither my wife or I have any TFSA accounts, which I understand would add up to $62K between the two of us.  As silly as it is to admit, our emergency fund is in our chequing account.

Our timeline for overseas work is 2-3 years right now, provided things work out ok.  I feel like good decisions with our money in the next few years could really pay off huge in the long run, and I would really appreciate any perspective or insight.",finance,1396708724

My husband recently graduated from school and is searching for a fulltime job, so hopefully we will be increasing our monthly income soon.

* I have savings bonds totaling $11,500 that could be cashed in

**Our current debt:**

* My student loan: $4,700 @ 2.375% fixed, sub

* Husband's ongoing student loans from previous degree (these were already consolidated once):

* * $11,500 @ 7.25% fixed, sub

* * $6,500 @ 4.81% variable, unsub

* Husband's new student loans that we will have to start paying in five months:

* * $4,500 @ 6.8% fixed, unsub (currently gaining interest)

* * $3,500 @ 3.4% fixed, sub

* Mortgage/insurance/property tax monthly payment: $560 @ 5.25% (Only about $230 of that is the mortgage payment. We still owe about $64K on the house)

* We have no car loans or credit card debt


**Potential cost of in-vitro fertilization: ~$15,000**

We would be able to try to finance the in-vitro fertilization (or at least part of it) through the fertility clinic if necessary. Won't know the interest rate until we apply though.


Any advice on what to do with our debt or how to tackle the potential new debt would be much appreciated!

gaming,"Locally ""streaming"" my 360/PS3/XB1","Here's the scenario.

I have a TV in one room that has my consoles hooked up.  (Currently it's a 360 and a PS3, XB1 will be added eventually, mainly because my co-op bud is a Halo fiend, I know, I know, get a PS4...)  My gaming PC is in another room.  

I'd like to be able to play my consoles while sitting at my gaming PC.  Ideally I'd do this wirelessly, but I could probably get away with Ethernet if that was not something doable.  I can easily use a wireless controller to control the console - they're not too far apart for that to work.  However, getting the video/audio to my PC is what I'm trying to figure out.  I don't mind a bit of latency (not 10's of seconds, but I'm not trying to play competitive online multiplayer with this setup)  I'd also like to be able to record screenshots or video on my PC if that is something that comes along with this or if it's something I can get for not a lot extra.

I've considered a few options:

- Running HDMI is kind of out of the question.  They're too far apart, too many walls in the way.
- I can't really build a PC with a capture card for the console room, that's kind of over budget (ideally I'd like whatever I buy to come in under $250 or so).  I know I could buy a PC and throw a capture card in it, have the capture card encode and stream over the network to the gaming PC.  I *do* have a laptop (quad core AMD 1GHz, dedicated ATI mobile GPU) I could use in the console room if it comes to it, although if the solution was self-contained that would be more ideal.
- No complicated setup to swap between the two modes.  I don't want to have to dig around in the entertainment center when I go from playing in the console room to playing in the gaming PC room.  HDMI switches are probably OK, ideally they're automatic if possible though.
- I don't mind a degradation in quality when playing on my PC monitor (ie, I will live with 720p30, some compression artifacts or whatever) as long as it doesn't degrade the quality when I'm playing in the console room.  
- Whatever I do, I'd like it to be reasonably ""present proofed"" - when I get around to buying a XB1/PS4, I'd like it to work.  HDCP obviously breaks this, so if the PS4 is out forever/until some future patch, that's acceptable.
- I **don't** plan to live-stream to twitch or anything like that.  There is no requirement to make that work in this scenario.

I've considered some of the [AVerMedia solutions](http://www.avermedia-usa.com//AVerTV/Product/ProductList.aspx?IID=7) but I'm not 100% sure they'd solve the problem.  Something like the Game Capture HD II would be perfect, but I don't think it would support streaming to my PC.  I could be wrong there.  There may be other companies that do similar stuff.  

Anybody have a setup like this?  How'd you do it?  Can I get what I want for the price I'm willing to pay?",technology,1396723132
Bitcoin,The Smoking Gun: Nick Szabo is Satoshi Nakamoto,"A recent [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/229qvr/happy_birthday_satoshi_nakamoto/) noted that Satoshi chose April 5th (today) as his birthday on his [Ning/P2P foundation](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto) profile.  

Many went on to note the significance of this date, as it was the day that Roosevelt signed the executive order 6102 confiscating all US citizens' gold in 1933.  

So what are the chances that Satoshi would know about this order, and think it was significant enough to reference as his birthday? 

What if I told you that the guy who considered the most likely candidate for Satoshi, who created ""Bit Gold"" in 2005 and asked someone to [help him code](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/04/bit-gold-markets.html) it in April 2008, wrote this [as a blog post comment](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/negative-rights-debate-continues.html#113409758546993406) in December 2005:

""Roosevelt's executive order was a culmination of the central bank gold hording war that greatly contributed to the Depression in the first place. Ironically, the order accused its victims of ""hording."" The Federal Reserve ""won"" the hording war and most other central banks went off gold altogether.""

And what if I told you he also [wrote in 1993](http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1993/10/msg00759.html): 

""In my limited experience creating Internet pseudonyms, I've been quite distracted by the continual need to avoid leaving pointers to my True Name lying around -- excess mail to/from my True Name, shared files, common peculiarities (eg misspellings in written text), traceable logins, etc.""

A common argument against Szabo usually mentions that he uses one space after a period, while Satoshi used two.  however in this 1993 email, Szabo used two spaces.  Also, he mentions changing spellings of words as a means of disguising your identity, which could explain Satoshi's british spellings.

It seems like ""satoshi"" kept his libertarian messaging to a minimum, likely to not hint at his true identity.  Well, the Bitcoin community may very well be in need of his wisdom and direction, because it's quickly losing its way in light of loud calls for regulation and centralization.",cryptocurrency,1396724168

personalfinance,"After some terrible financial decisions, I'm ready to dig myself out","Hey PF, long time lurker. Throwaway, for anonymity. I'm looking for some advice on my plan to dig myself out of some earlier poor financial choices. Quick background story might be useful.

After my second year in college, I went on a co-op that quickly turned into a full time job offer. Being young and incredibly foolish, I ended up with one car loan at $13k and a second car loan at $7k. I never missed any payments and had a credit score of 800+, but it seemed like there'd never be an end to the payments. I lived paycheck-to-paycheck for two years, and when I grew tired of it, I realized I had to go back to school to really have a chance of digging myself out of this mess.

I buckled down and saved every possible penny for a year, but the week classes started, I was laid off from my job. I had counted on a continued part time income when saving and budgeting, so the loss hit me hard. I wasn't able to find part-time work at anywhere near the same pay rate; my savings quickly ran dry, and I racked up $6k in credit card debt.

Fortunately, my dad loaned me $10k over the course of two years to cover my rent/school needs. The $13k car was repossessed, the other loan went into default, and the credit card account was eventually closed. I sold/pawned every single thing I owned (EVERY. THING.) to have enough for food. With a summer internship, I was able to save up enough to buy a beat-up old camaro for $1.5k. 

Since I graduated last June, I've held a full-time position making $60k salary, with $5k in bonuses last year. I'm expecting a $15k raise this June, and $10k in bonuses this year. I paid off the credit card debt and the remaining repo debt as of last December, while making minimum payments on everything else. My remaining debts:

* $7k owed to my dad, no interest
* $4k owed to different bank for older car loan (for a car I no longer had) , 0% 
*  ~$47k in 10 federal student loans, ranging from $1.2k to $9k, mostly at 6.8% 
* $4.5k perkins loans
* ~$2k in various collections for hospital bills and such
* $11k for a car that was SUPPOSED to be more reliable, bought last October, 3.5%

I wanted to be further along by now, but a lot of costly emergencies came up (e.g. $4k needed for a new engine for my car when the engine threw a rod the day after the warranty expired). 

As I currently stand, I have $486 in my checking account, and roughly bi-weekly paychecks. My expenses are:

* $550/month rent
* $45/month vet bill (dog gets a lot of ear infections)
* $65/month garage fee at work
* $100/month car insurance.
* $360/month savings
* $8/month netflix
* $150/week ""allowance"" (buy groceries, haircuts, drinks)

My top priority is repaying my dad - I'm committed to paying him $500/month, but want to squeeze in as much more as possible. My minimum payments for my debts come out to $700/month (excluding dad); I'd like to start with a snowball of an extra $1k put towards payments to my dad, and at least another $360/month to savings. After that loan's repaid, I want to quickly drop the balance of my car loan to at least $8k, as this car is incredibly high risk for throwing another rod. I'd like to trade it in for something comparable ASAP. From there, I think I may want to tackle the smallest student loans first - most of them are at 6.8%, including a $10k one.

I currently have no 401k, but want to starting making contributions (even if they're only 1%). I have no real assets, aside from my old camaro (not going to part with it - at 170,000 miles, she's only needed $500 in parts in 2 years and I do the labor).

Does this sound like a feasible/sustainable plan? Between graduation and now, I've been throwing money at things without fully planning it out. I sometimes go 3, almost 4 weeks without a paycheck (but I always receive two each month), so budgeting is incredibly difficult. I'm finally starting to see money left over at the end of the pay period, and I want to make sure I'm using it wisely.

I wasn't able to find part-time work at anywhere near the same pay rate; my savings quickly ran dry, and I racked up $6k in credit card debt.

Fortunately, my dad loaned me $10k over the course of two years to cover my rent/school needs. The $13k car was repossessed, the other loan went into default, and the credit card account was eventually closed. I sold/pawned every single thing I owned (EVERY. THING.) to have enough for food. With a summer internship, I was able to save up enough to buy a beat-up old camaro for $1.5k. 

Since I graduated last June, I've held a full-time position making $60k salary, with $5k in bonuses last year. I'm expecting a $15k raise this June, and $10k in bonuses this year. I paid off the credit card debt and the remaining repo debt as of last December, while making minimum payments on everything else. My remaining debts:

* $7k owed to my dad, no interest
* $4k owed to different bank for older car loan (for a car I no longer had) , 0% 
*  ~$47k in 10 federal student loans, ranging from $1.2k to $9k, mostly at 6.8% 
* $4.5k perkins loans
* ~$2k in various collections for hospital bills and such
* $11k for a car that was SUPPOSED to be more reliable, bought last October, 3.5%

I wanted to be further along by now, but a lot of costly emergencies came up (e.g. $4k needed for a new engine for my car when the engine threw a rod the day after the warranty expired). 

As I currently stand, I have $486 in my checking account, and roughly bi-weekly paychecks. My expenses are:

* $550/month rent
* $45/month vet bill (dog gets a lot of ear infections)
* $65/month garage fee at work
* $100/month car insurance.
* $360/month savings
* $8/month netflix
* $150/week ""allowance"" (buy groceries, haircuts, drinks)

My top priority is repaying my dad - I'm committed to paying him $500/month, but want to squeeze in as much more as possible. My minimum payments for my debts come out to $700/month (excluding dad); I'd like to start with a snowball of an extra $1k put towards payments to my dad, and at least another $360/month to savings. After that loan's repaid, I want to quickly drop the balance of my car loan to at least $8k, as this car is incredibly high risk for throwing another rod and I'd like to trade it in for something comparable ASAP. From there, I think I may want to tackle the smallest student loans first - most of them are at 6.8%, including a $10k one.

I currently have no 401k, but want to starting making contributions (even if they're only 1%). I have no real assets, aside from my old camaro (not going to part with it - at 170,000 miles, she's only needed $500 in parts in 2 years and I do the labor).

Does this sound like a feasible/sustainable plan? Between graduation and now, I've been throwing money at things without fully planning it out. I sometimes go 3, almost 4 weeks without a paycheck (but I always receive two each month), so budgeting is incredibly difficult. I'm finally starting to see money left over at the end of the pay period, and I want to make sure I'm using it wisely.

TL;DR: Car dealership screwed me over. Lots of debt resulted. Hopefully not drowning in it?",finance,1396734260
personalfinance,Some questions about FERS ...,"I'm 31 years old and I recently accepted a position within a Federal agency with an annual salary of $65k. If I stay in this position (rather than going to grad school) I'll cap out at an annual salary of $103k in 30 years ($124k if I go to grad school). The FERS basic pension with this salary would end up giving me $23k/year (with the 1.1% calculation) whereas if I stick with state employment where I'd cap out at $86k year (I currently make $52k a year), the annual pension benefit would be $51k a year with their 2% calculation. Would the Thrift Savings Plan make up for that ~$30k difference? The benefits where I'm currently at are pretty good but the job really sucks and is dangerous... this new job has better working conditions, an awesome supervisor, higher pay, and more paid time off but I'd have to pay more for health and dental benefits. I'm just kind of fretting over this because I haven't made a major decision like this before. (This is all contingent on pre-employment screening of course).

personalfinance,Wanting to sell my vehicle and purchase something else of similar value. Should I finance to build credit?,"OK, so I've set aside some cash, and have someone interested in buying my truck. I could take the money and buy the vehicle I want, but is it better to finance the vehicle to help build my credit? Not sure exactly what my score is but it could be much better.

I realize the interest rates may be high, and if it is, then I won't do it. I don't want to necessarily pay for my credit increase. I could put all the cash into another investment and pull it out to make payments, hoping that the interest gained is more than what's charged on the financing (no guarantee, I know).

Is there a minimum amount of time that something like this would need to be financed and paid on before it really affects my credit positively? I've heard paying a car off too soon can hurt credit. Is this true?

and just in case your curious about my financial situation. I live at home with mom, and $900 covers all of my bills. I bring home $2k+. Essentially I could afford to make payments while keeping the money from my truck in an investment. Does it make sense to put a bunch in now, or smaller amounts over time?

Edit: after the first few comments I have a new approach. Since I have the cash to cover the cost of the new vehicle, once I sell my truck, I'll buy it outright, then get a credit card, or few, and maintain those appropriately.

Recently, I took a peek at my dad's finances and saw he was still having a bit of a hard time. Roughly, $107k worth of debt piled up. A mortgage around $31k @ 8% APR, a home equity loan of $33k @ 8% APR, and nearly $53k of high interest rate (20+%) of credit debt.

My parents make about $4.6k combined a month, where $2.3k of that goes towards debt, and $0.9k goes towards bills. Leaving about $1.4k left a month. Their house is worth about $109k.

Sitting down I calculated it all out, and found a way to help my dad completely absolve all his debt within a 3 year, 6 month span. Consolidate all his debt under a refinance.

personalfinance,"27-year-old, $110k student loan debt. Just got a 2nd job working 100 hours 7 days/week. $50k after taxes. Desperately trying to hold onto hope. Did Sallie Mae steal $20k from me?","I'm a 27-year-old woman with $110k student loan debt and about $5k in other debt.

I recently (2 months ago) got a 2nd job. I work 7 days a week making about 50k after taxes (in Hawaii- very high cost of living, if it matters.) Rent and utilities are paid for by my 2nd job.

I have an excellent reputation in my field (human services- working with people with developmental disabilities) and am trying to save 15k a year to enter a masters program. After a year in this program I have been guaranteed a job that will raise my salary 20k and in 4 years after I complete my license my salary will increase by at least 40k.

I am very gifted in my field but have very little knowledge/understanding of finances. I grew up poor and am the first in my family to go to college, which is why I made the terrible mistake of borrowing too much money to pay for such an expensive school at 17.

$26k loans are federal, so I'm not too worried about those because they are willing to work with me on affordable payments.

The other $84k were private Sallie Mae loans. My original loan was for $80k but when I couldn't make the minimum payments (human services is not a very lucrative field) they continually suggested forbearance (which I thought was generous at the time) and capitalized the interest - resulting in my current situation.

Long story short, I was told private loans are not eligible for income based repayment. I ended up defaulting on the private loans.

After getting this 2nd job, I was optimistic that I could finally stop avoiding the 10 creditor calls per day and start making some real headway on my life. I was wrong.

I called Sallie Mae about paying on my private loans, and to my surprise, they told me they couldn't talk to me about them because they had been sold to a 3rd party. After over and hour on the phone no one could tell me who had purchased my loans and then my call was disconnected.

Not long after, I received a call from the company that claimed to have purchased my loans and told me I owed $84k, but couldn't explain why the price was so high. 2 months prior I had come into $20k and paid off one of my loans with Sallie Mae, expecting that now I owed $64k in private loans. They claimed they couldn't talk to me about Sallie Mae loans because they didn't have the account and Sallie Mae claimed they couldn't talk to me about the account because they no longer hold the private loans.

I have never received notification, paperwork or statements from the new company that holds my private loans. But they did know exact dollar amounts of each loan I owed. The person I spoke to was incredibly aggressive and wouldn't answer a lot of my questions when I asked for clarifications. I asked what kind of payment program we could work out and he informed me that ""payment plans were not an option."" but that I could settle the debt for $51k. When I asked him how I was expected to pay $51k in full when I hadn't even been able to make minimum payments he told me I was being disrespectful, told me to call back when I was ready to respect him and hung up on me.

I don't know what to do. If I could pay the $51k it would save me a lot of money; but no bank in their right mind would loan me that kind of money. I have never had a family and have no friends that could help me out (not that I would ever consider asking.)

I had often contemplated suicide due to this and other factors. When I was making my plans to give up I realized that it didn't have to be that way and instead I got a 2nd job that doubled my income and paid my rent due to my proficiency in my field. I was optimistic about straightening out my life- and then this. I just don't know what I can do. How can I pay $51k without a repayment option?

If I need harsh criticism, please, let me have it. I don't want to live my life this way and I don't want to be a deadbeat that doesn't pay my bills. Please help me.

As I said, I grew up poor,  work in a human service field and have no affinity for financial related things- but I want (and need) to learn. Please ELI5 (explain like I'm 5) what I can do to fix this situation and things most normal people already know by my age, to help me in my future. I am doing this alone and have no support in my life, except you, Reddit.

Thank you so, so much for reading this post.

TL;DR: I messed up. I couldn't pay my bills. Got a 2nd job so that I can- now it seems like it's too late. Spent too long blaming others, finally took a long look at myself and accepted responsibility and willing to do whatever it takes. Need some serious direction and any criticism I deserve.

Bitcoin,Why don't people say gold will be worth a million dollars?,"People used to say gold will be worth hundred thousand dollars or tens thousand dollars. They were all proven wrong because federal reserve loaned out foreign governments' gold to banks who then sold it for USD to buy US government bonds. Also gold futures were issued which could be settled in USD. So now gold price is under control.

Nowadays Bitfinex exchange allows bitcoin interest rates and rollover fees to be settled in USD. So who is to prevent some bank from using 0% USD borrowed from federal reserve to pay interest and rollover fees to borrow all the coins there, rollover the debt forever, and keep selling the coins for USD with no intention of creating a short squeeze?

Maybe when Barry silbert starts his second market bitcoin exchange, he will issue futures on his bitcoin etf units which can be settled in usd too.

The big bonus in my mind is the inflation protection, we've been in an extraordinary period of low inflation, but sometime in the next 10 years it will likely go higher (IMHO) and the I-series rate adjusts up for inflation, but never below 0%.

I pay about $1140 to the Federal loan debt and about $1500 to my parents for the home equity loan.

I try to make an extra $250 per week payment to the Federal loan debt because its interest rate averages 6.4% and the home equity is around 3%)

I take 10% of both job 1 and job 2 and ""pay myself"" into a separate savings account which is now around $4000 (0.95% interest, any better idea where I can move the money into)

I've been a huge fan of this sub and hope you guys can help me out with a problem I've had most of my life: saving. 

It's always seemed like an easy concept to me, yet I'm always draining my checking with seemingly frivolous purchases.



**Backstory**

I'm 18 years old...part time student at my local state school and owner of a successful video production business. I always had the hobby of video and a couple years ago I found that I was decent enough to make money doing it... The first semester of college I went full time but because my business venture has been so successful, I've dropped down to 2 classes a week to take on more work. College tuition is about $15k full time a year of which I'm paying most of in federal loans (obviously it will be less per year since I'm going part time now). My parents are covering my rent for me. 

I'm mostly involved in my video production company - I make a minimum of about $30/hour on the lower end and sometimes as much as over $100 an hour for certain jobs (it's usually around $40/hr). 



**The Problem**

My income isn't constant...some months I can pull in several thousand and some months I'll pull in about $500. I've always been an impulsive spender with tech related stuff, especially video related gear that can help my business grow. I find that I can *very* easily pull the trigger to buy a piece of equipment that I think can help to make my videos look better and further differentiate myself from other competitors in my area. I have a very high end arsenal of equipment for my company but it's very hard for me to think I have *enough* because my industry entirely rides on new technology trends and new equipment. A lot of the equipment I buy really **does** help me to be able to command higher rates for my services, but sometimes I feel as though I blow through my money too easily.


I've opened a business checking and savings account to help me separate my finances a bit...but with my bank's mobile app it makes it *too* easy to transfer my money into a place where I can easily spend it. I've found that giving about 20% of my income regularly to my dad who keeps a record of how much he has helps to create a barrier between my money and I. If I'm not able to see the money, I tend to forget I even have it saved away somewhere and am much less likely to spend it.

I know because of the nature of my work that I need to have a very solid savings plan in place...I'm also interested in eventually opening up an index fund with Schwab when I have about $5k saved up beyond any emergency funds/general savings. I'd also eventually like to open a 401k but currently I'm technically a freelancer since I just contract people out. I'm pretty clueless how to get started with this stuff as I was a high schooler just last year.

Bitcoin,"Like any currency, Bitcoin vulnerable to speculators","Let's compare bitcoin to its symbolic twin, the Thai baht.  In the 90s, billions of dollars were invested in Thailand.  In 1997, the currency came under speculative attack and a rush to exit the baht occurred.

Dollar reserves: the central bank buys baht to prop up the price. Obviously this is not relevant to bitcoin.  

Interest rates: the central bank makes holding baht more attractive by raising interest rates.  This doesn't seem relevant either; are there bitcoin bonds?  Contemplate the difference between an income-generating investment and currency speculation.  

Capital controls: restricting the sale of baht blocks capital outflows.  This is currently in effect for bitcoin, because bitcoins are not really liquid.

**Trades for the week:** I had no trades this week - in fact I barely had a chance to watch the market this week!  Ugh.

----

**Other thoughts:**  Quarter END:  As of pre-market opening on 1 April, I was up almost 50% on the year!  Fantastic...  

...But short-lived, unfortunately -- I'm not starting the quarter off very well it seems: my account lost almost $9K between Tuesday and Friday this past week.  Lovely, especially considering I had no time to watch closely.  I am still up 37% overall on the year and that's not half bad.

It seems the market is going through a crap-ton of turmoil this last week and it seems to be bipolar -- not sure whether to rise or fall.  Events in Europe, the Fed getting their new legs and a bunch of freaked out ""doomsdayers"" predicting a market crash are not contributing to market confidence I think.

I think April may be a bit of a rocky month, but hopefully with the growing sentiment that marijuana will become a more accepted substance in the US, I feel that even in a bad market, these fledgling businesses have a chance to shine.  I firmly believe there will be some serious scrutiny of the MJ market in the coming months as the SEC starts putting more of a spotlight on this now very visible industry.  You'll see some fraud come out of the woodwork and probably another 100 companies try to join in on the profiting opportunities.  Be careful and always do your due diligence -- this is a hot market segment and there are those keen on preying on the unsuspecting willing to part with their investments.

At quarter end, I was looking back at the history of my brokerage account and at the low point in mid-2012, the account balance was under $25K.  I can honestly say that I would not have predicted that in under 2 years that same account would be worth over 4 times what it was at the low point.

I'm looking a bit further out here though -- I fully expected the massive gains I made in March to be a bit short-lived.  I went from under 20% to 40% in just a couple of weeks.  I was certain there would be a correction in there coming.  I guess that's been happening this past week.  Perhaps it will taper off a bit, but again, many of my positions are being held for their future potential and I don't intend selling off.  If it takes another quarter before they turn around, so be it -- they have massive upside potential and I don't mind waiting. :)

**Thoughts on next week:**  *IF* I get an opportunity next week, I may do some consolidation to pare down on a few underperformers or stocks I don't really have a long-term interest in holding.  There are a few new bright spots coming up that have been performing well and I may get a couple of new positions open on them, although I'm more apt to watch their patterns a bit before pulling the trigger.  It might be a light trading week for me next week as well because of my workload.

As always, I welcome your thoughts and feedback!  I hope everyone's investments are providing them good returns!

personalfinance,"After struggling for years with my finances (including Chapter 7 in 2003) I finally have control, a house, decent start on savings, and an 800+ credit score. I just need some guidance on using my savings better and maximizing my results","A little background first:

I have been a waiter most of my life and dealt with a lot of cash.  When  I was younger I had no control with my spending and struggled constantly. I took a break from serving for about 10 years and kept struggling paycheck to paycheck. After a couple of years filled with really bad decisions, I filed Chapter 7 and started over.  I wasn't happy about it, but it really did give me a fresh start and took full advantage of it and rebuilt my life to the point I now own my home with a really low fixed APR. My credit score is right about 800. I have a decent amount of money set aside in a few different **basic** savings accounts. I have one credit card with a $4500 balance with a very low, special interest rate.  I am waiting tables again and make pretty good money compared to my bills and expenses. My current focus is paying off the one credit card as soon as possible so I can have zero credit card debt.


I currently have $14,350 in 4 different savings accounts at a credit union.  I use 3 of them for keeping specific bills separate and organized.  

My main savings account has a little more than $7,000 in it. (it was drained when I bought my house 2 1/2 years ago and I've just been trying to build it back up)  I currently deposit $60 a week into the savings.  I can probably bump that up a little, but right now I'm sending as much extra as I can to pay off the credit card. The credit union savings pay a very small monthly dividend ($.59 last month) so I KNOW I can do more with my money.  I just need a little guidance on where to start.  Roth IRA? Money Market? CD's? I really don't even know where to begin. 

I'll be honest and say I'm a little nervous about putting it somewhere that's not liquid.  I know if comes from struggling for so many years, but I know I can get over it. 

Sorry for the wall of text.  I hope I gave you enough info.  If there's anything else specific you'd like to know to make suggestions for me, just ask.

personalfinance,"Three degrees, first good job. Pay loans off faster or start saving for retirement?","So I am finally done with school and have several degrees to show for it and a fairly substantial amount of debt (but far lower than most peers) at around $60,000.

I am a contractor, at least int he short-term, at a great company. They hire everyone as a contractor to try them out before giving full-time offers. Anyways, at least while in this position I have NO 401k matching.

Should I open up this 401k with no matching? Especially when in a year I will be hired full-time there or some place else? Should I focus all my money on paying off my student loan debt instead? I assume the interest rates (6.5%-6.8%) are higher than any retirement account returns. Also, how long do I have to notify the loan people that my income has changed significantly?

personalfinance,"23 years old // NYC // 65k salary // $11,233 in student loans // $9,000 in ATT stock // questions about paying off loans and Simple IRA vs Roth IRA","All loans are a fixed rate, subsidized, and in the grace period until June. They are as follows:


Loan Name|Interest Rate|Balance
:---|:---|---:
Direct Sub Stafford Loan |3.4%|$2,233.00
Direct Sub Stafford Loan |3.4%|$2,500.00
Direct Sub Stafford Loan |4.5%|$3,000.00
Federal Stafford Loan |5.6%|$3,500.00
Total | - | $11,233.00

I know I should start with the loan that has the highest interest rate, but what is the best way of making a repayment schedule? Do I just put forth the maximum my monthly budget will allow, or will I be tied to a payment schedule defined by myfedloan.org? I can't seem to find this information on the site. 

The other option I've considered is selling the ATT stock in order to knock out a big chunk of the loans now, before they start accruing interest. I received the stock from a trust my grandmother set up for me. Upon her passing I have owned the stock for a little over a year (dividends are reinvested, do those shares count as ""new stocks"") so the capital gains tax would be 15%. From what I can gather Schwab will charge $8.95 when selling. This will leave me with $7,641.05. I could pay-off the two highest interest rate loans, have about $1,000 to spare as the start of an emergency fund, and be left with $4,733 in loans at 3.4% which wont gain interest until June. 

My other question is about setting up a retirement account. I am starting my job a week from tomorrow. I'll be receiving a $65,000 salary plus an undefined performance bonus (if all goes well). The company offers a SIMPLE IRA that is self-directed, but I will not receive employer matching (3%) until I have been with the company for 2 years. The SIMPLE IRA has a contribution limit of $12,000, but after taxes and with the high cost of living in NYC, I don't imagine I'll be able to max it out anyway. 

From what I understand a SIMPLE IRA is tax-deferred, has a 10% penalty for taking early distributions, and has a 2 year waiting period before it can be rolled over into something else. With these attributes in mind, along with my anticipation of being in a higher tax bracket later in life, should I just set up my own Roth IRA and wait to contribute to the SIMPLE IRA until my company starts matching? If so, my annual contribution limit will be $5,500. After taxes I think I'll have about $40,000 (25% federal income tax + New York taxes), so the $5,500 will be about 14% of my after-tax income. Does saving this much for 2 years while my employer doesn't match make sense? I of course can continue to save income through other types of investments. One thing I should check is if I need to be enrolled in the SIMPLE IRA for 2 years to get the employer match, or if I only need to be an employee for 2 years. 

Any suggestions on any of my questions will be hugely appreciated. I'm very new to personal finance, so this is all a little intimating. Thanks!",finance,1396811994

&gt;Thanks!
&gt;


To whom it may concern, 

I am writing regarding the latest ruling of the Internal Revenue
Service regarding Virtual Currency taxation (IR-2014-36). Due to
several critical mistakes in this ruling, I am writing to recommend
that the IRS suspend its guidance pending a period of public comment
and Congressional oversight. Mistakes in the IRS guidance include
giving the American public 20 days notice to calculate and pay $900
million dollars in new taxes, failing to provide any guidance on how
to calculate the new tax, creating new tax law ex-post-facto, and
ignoring the speculative nature of emerging markets.

In 2013, 1.5 million Bitcoins were mined. In December of 2013,
Bitcoins were traded for $1300/coin. At this exchange rate, Bitcoin
mining in 2013 constitutes $1.9 Billion in wealth. The IRS has ruled
that this wealth is to be taxed as gross self-employment income; for
most individuals this will be a 32% marginal rate combined with a
self-employment tax rate of %15 for a total tax treatment of %47, or
$900 Million in new taxes. While potentially a bold move to solve the
deficit, this guidance was released March 25th, twenty days before the
$900 million bill is due. The IRS guidance advised that all Virtual
Currency taxes were due on April 15th and that all penalties,
including criminal, will apply for late payment. This timeline gives
Bitcoin entreprenuers, lawyers, accountants, and tax software authors
a timeline of 20 days to calculate and move nearly a billion dollars
into the Federal Treasury. This guidance is neither feasible,
reasonable, or in the best interests of the United States.

To move nearly a billion dollars into the federal treasury in 20 days,
tax must be calculated. The IRS has given the following instruction:
""taxpayers will be required to determine the fair market value of
virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment or
receipt"". This simple guidance ignores the following facts of Bitcoin
mining:

* Virtual currency mining is done through anonymous cooperatives known
as ""pools""

* Pools distribute partial payouts of virtual currency, when found, via
complex share-based contributor contracts with various names,
including PPS, PPLNS, and over 50 other contract types.

* Depending on whether the IRS ""Doctrine of Constructive Receipt""
applies to virtual currency, a miner can be said to have received
virtual currency at many points during the satisfaction of said
contract, sometimes taking as long as a month. Receipt of currency
could occur when accounts are credited, when blocks are found, or when
wallets are credited. Today, no one knows when on this timeline the
IRS intends to apply tax. The IRS refuses to answer the question of
whether constructive receipt applies.

* The speculative value of Bitcoin can and has swung up to 90% during
the time intervals that pools use to distribute virtual currency,
causing a corresponding 90% uncertainty in the amount of tax owed.

* The IRS has released no guidance on this timing uncertainty, and has
refused to answer all questions on the subject, include those posed by
this author by phone and in writing.

As a result, taxpayers must calculate and pay nearly a billion dollars
in new income taxes, in twenty days, on threat of criminal penalties,
with no guidance as to how much tax is due and up to a 90% variance in
the possible amount of tax due. This is not sound tax policy, imposes
an unreasonable burden, and deprives even the most honest &amp; compliant
citizens of the ability to calculate and pay taxes.

Finally, the new IRS guidance ignores the speculative nature of
Virtual Currencies. All Bitcoin miners, this author included, had
planned with their accountants to pay capital gains tax on any gained
capital as a result of Virtual Currency sales. However, many miners
chose never to sell virtual currency due to the lack of a robust or
fair market. Of the two biggest Bitcoin exchanges in 2013, the first,
Mt. Gox, has been shown to be a Ponzi scheme and has gone bankrupt,
keeping all investor funds. The second, BTC-E, is located somewhere in
Eastern Europe and its operators are unknown but rumored to be
criminals. These are the markets that the IRS is endorsing in its
guidance as ""fair market"". The IRS guidance requires Americans to sell
$900 million worth of virtual currency on these markets in order to
satisfy a new tax burden.

Many miners see these markets as risky and emerging and have held
virtual currency without spending it, cognizant that on any day, the
value of Bitcoin may be zero. For most miners, this means that taxes
on Bitcoins mined in 2013 will be taxed at their 2013 trade value of
$1300/coin, and tax will be paid by selling at today's price of
$400/coin. This means that most miners will owe more in taxes than
their Bitcoin is worth, and will be paying taxes out of their life
savings on income they never earned. This is what I will be doing on
April 15th. The IRS has purchased a massive ""short sale"" option
against the American people, assessing tax at a price over twice as
high as the price Americans are now forced to sell.

No bitcoin miner would have entered into this agreement
knowingly. Like many miners, had I known that 46% tax would be
assessed at speculative prices, I would never have entered into such a
liability. The option of being forced to sell half of my Bitcoins
every day on foreign exchanges operated by criminals and moving
thousands of dollars into overseas accounts was not a risk I was
willing to take. This risk is what the IRS has required with its
guidance. The IRS has classified mined Bitcoin as income
retroactively, against all guidance and wisdom, and caused those who
entered into this hobby to incur massive tax debt against gains they
have never realized. This retroactive ruling bears all the worst
elements of ex-post-facto tax law, a practice our Founding Fathers
worked so hard to prevent.

When the Internet revolution swept over America in the early 90s,
Congress wisely allowed it to flourish and kept control of the
Internet within the United States, control we still enjoy today. Like
America's Mining Act of 1872, Denmark and other countries have opted
to forgo a tax on Bitcoin mining due to its speculative nature, and
instead tax only capital gained. Bitcoin is at the center of the
virtual currency revolution, and the IRS has given miners, the core of
this revolution, a choice of Denmark at 0% or the United States at
46%. We are chasing all the talent, investment, mindshare and control
of an emerging revolution out of the country. We have created
impossible, uninformed guidance and given America twenty days to pay a
billion-dollar tax bill. We have placed a billion dollar ""short sell""
option against the American taxpayer and forced her to pay out of her
life savings. We have engaged in the worst type of ex-post-facto
lawmaking.

The IRS must immediately announce suspension of its guidance pending a
period of public comment and Congressional oversight. During this
period of oversight, the following minimum reforms should be
undertaken:

* America should be given more than twenty days to assess taxes owed
before penalties are incurred.

* The IRS must answer basic questions about the amount of tax owed
before imposing penalties for non-compliance.

* Bitcoin taxes should be applied only from time of announcement
forwards, allowing Virtual Currency users to make informed decisions.

Thank you, and God Bless America.

Sincerely,

Bitcoin,"""So how are you ever going to solve the problems you're talking about? ... how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works?"" ['Found Poem' on Bitcoin]","**First, a little bit of meta to give you some context:**

A poem I wrote using ""[found quotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_poetry)"".  

The poem is my attempt to express something that has been kicking around in my head, but I can only seem to express it using other people's words. 

I heard you like meta, so I'll put some meta in this meta, so you can get some context on this context:
&gt;[A poem begins with a lump in the throat; a home-sickness or a love-sickness. It is a reaching-out toward expression; an effort to find fulfillment. A complete poem is one where an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found the words.](http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Frosts-Poems-Frost/dp/product-description/0312983328)

&gt;[Sometimes I have my doubts of words altogether, and I ask myself what is the place of them. They are worse than nothing unless they do something; unless they amount to deeds, as in ultimatums or battle-cries. They must be flat and final like the show-down in poker, from which there is no appeal. My definition of poetry (if I were forced to give one) would be this: words that become deeds.](http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Frosts-Poems-Frost/dp/product-description/0312983328)
&gt; - Robert Frost

I was inspired by the recent TED talk by Lawrence Lessig entitled ""The unstoppable walk to political reform"".  I saw it on my Google+ feed being shared by Guy Kawasaki.  The last quote in the poem is from that ted talk. I can't recommend enough taking a look at it.


I'm not sure what to give it for a title. I'll leave that up to you. 


**And now the poem itself:**

&gt; [Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress. I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption. I don't mean any criminal act. The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal. It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.

&gt; [So here's the model of government. They have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency, but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence, no longer a dependence upon the people alone, increasingly a dependence upon the funders. Now this is a dependence too, but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people. This is a corruption. ](http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim)

personalfinance,Direct Consolidation? Extended Repayment? Graduated Payments? Guidance Appreciated!,"If I was to choose the extended term repayment plan, would I be eligible to change repayment plans later on if I wanted, or would it just be prudent to leave as-is and pay more each month? I'm trying to decided which is safest for now. I am currently repaying 2 private loans and another federal loan is hanging in the rafters. Should I consider the federal loans (there are two lenders and a mixture of subsidized and not)?   

Further information:  
I have less than 30K in direct loans, around 40 in FFEL loans. A total of around 70K for both. I also have one low interest Sallie Mae loan of 30K and a high interest bank student loan for 10K. The 9% loan needs to be paid off first and foremost. I make around 40K a year.  

For month fees, I split rent + utilities with a roommate, have 2 consolidated credit cards of around 2K, and am trying to build a savings account. Assuming my monthly budget is accurate and I curb some unneeded items out of the budget (like my Lynda.com account), I can have around 800-1000 leftover each month to play around with after all things are paid. This is even after my typical monthly average for food and misc experiences.

Would it be wise to consider consolidating the federal loans and extending the payments that way so that the Direct loans will also be blessed into that combination? Then I can shoot the most money toward the private loan and credit cards, also making the two federal loans become one to manage. Advice is much appreciated!",finance,1396843300

personalfinance,People of reddit; do you have a parent(s) that you support financially? If so how is it working out?,"Hi guys, this is the first discussion I'm starting here so pardon my poor etiquette...

I'm one of those people described in the title. My mom has been struggling financially for a long time. Since I got my first job in highschool, she would ask for $20 here $50 there, and I obliged because she was my mother and that's what you are supposed to do.

All throughout college as I lived on campus, I would help her out from what little I earned on the side and we would have our ""shouting moments"" when I was in a tight spot and she was in a tight spot(the difference between books and putting gas in her car(she was having trouble in her marriage)) when she was laid off from a fruitful fulltime job, this was in 2007. Then she got a divorce four years ago and was left with a house, car note, and barely any way to pay for it except a temp job making $13/hr. Alimony from from the divorce, her getting a new job making 30k, and my job as a programmer would be her saving grace.

After the alimony ended so did my job, and I had to find something fast or we would lose our only home, fortunately I did, but it was less than what I was making before. On top of this the asshole exhusband/my exstepdad kept threatening to kick us out for missing mortgage payments because it was affecting his credit, I paid as much as I could only to find out she hasn't been able to keep up with the financial demand (I should have questioned this further). I found a new job for more money and decided to move out of the underwater house and continued to pay for 1/2 the mortgage (she still didn't pay...). 6 months after I left the house was placed on the market after the exhusband's new wife pressured him to get rid of the property due to delinquency. Mom received $5000 from the short sale and found a new apartment. 

Fast forward to this year and this is where she stands::
She now makes $40k/year (from $33k).
Rent is $950/mth (I contribute $300-400 it's all I can afford now).
Her car note is $610/mth at an 9.99% APR the principle balance is 27k.
She has approx $2000 in credit card debt.
She owes Uncle Sam $2,500 from exempting federal taxes alot on her paychecks, and they could start garnishing her wages at a moment's notice (*not good when you break even every month*).
Monthly expenses are $2060 (not including gas, groceries, and other necessities).
She has student loans, but no degree.
The $5k from the short sale is now gone paying misc bills and rent.

Things in my life are starting to get complicated as well. I'm engage to a very beautiful woman. I would like to have kids in the near future but I don't think now would be a wise choice considering my mother and I predicament. That and I absolutely **do not** want to bring her into this situation which has caused me to push the wedding back to 2016. Every $100-200 I spend I have to consider whether or not it will affect my mom for food and gas.

I love my mom very much, she has helped me get through some tough times. She is in a better spot than most Americans here, but that could soon change. Is there anything I can do to get her out of this mess?

I have been working for my company for 13 years and for the past 3-4 years I have been a remote worker from NY. I made my official *remote worker* status official with the company earlier this year, in anticipation of a move out of the north east. Many other people within my company have the same *remote worker* status and I have 3 levels of approval on this move out of the north east!

My employer is in NJ and I expect that I would still pay NJ state income tax on my paycheck. So in preparation of making this move, I am trying to determine my income, and ultimately my budget. Both [ADP](https://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/payroll-calculators/adp-calculator-faq.aspx#10) and [PayCheckCity](http://www.paycheckcity.com/pages/faqs.php) do not support estimating working in one state, while living in another. So has anyone successfully estimated their new take home pay with www.paycheckcity.com combining both state estimates? Any other suggestions? Should I call my payroll department?

I realize that FL does not have an income tax, but I just want to be prepared if we decide to move elsewhere in order to prepare *another* budget.

personalfinance,28 - First time buyer: how much house can I afford?,"Hey Reddit,

Housing prices are blowing up where I live (San Francisco) and I'm thinking about buying my first house. When it comes to this part of finance I'm a total noob with regards to mortgage interest deductions, total cost of home ownership/rainy day fund for a house, property taxes, mortgage types, etc. My overall goal is to figure how aggressive I can be and see what my upper price limit is for buying a house. Your help and comments is greatly appreciated!

My financial profile:

* Age: 28
* Cash Savings: I have about $215k in cash, $65k in stocks, $60k from my parents whenever I ask for it
* Retirement Accounts: $190k in various 401k/Roth/Traditional IRAs. I really don't want to use this but I heard if you're buying your first home you can withdraw from retirement accounts without a penalty?

In terms of comp for paying a monthly mortgage:

* My base salary is $200k/year
* My target bonus is $200k/year. I feel very confident I'll get at least 85% of that a year
* My stock is worth $200k/year. I feel somewhat confident in this. Worst case scenario it'll be worth 50% of face value. Since it's stock, if it's underwater, I'd prefer to hold onto instead of having to sell it to pay a mortgage
* My BF makes about $65k/year and he'd be contributing to the mortgage as well
* Located in California so assume relatively high federal and state tax rates
* No debt other than a $1k/month car payment

If you were in my financial situation, what would be the max amount you'd feel comfortable paying for a house? What percentage would you put down? Would you do a 30 year fixed for security, or be more aggressive and do a 5/1 ARM so you can buy something more expensive? Would you borrow from the retirement accounts to put a bigger down payment down? After putting down the down payment down, how much cash should I have on hand for a rainy day fund?

personalfinance,"Questions About My Overall Financial Situation, Continuing Education, Etc.","Hi PF!  Like many others, I have lurked here for quite some time, taking in the awesome advice you all give.  My financial situation is not particularly bad at the moment (I don't think), but I would still like feed back on a few things.  I am 25 years old, have a job working 32 hours/week as an administrative assistant, and am finishing my second year of a masters program in counseling psychology.  First, here are my debts and income:

Income: 

-$1900/month year-round, plus another $100-300/month from about May-October playing music at Weddings (fun side job!).

Debt: 

-$40,000 in federal student loans, of which about $13,000 is subsidized.  These are in deferment, as I am still a full-time student in a counseling psychology masters program.  I estimate I will probably need to take out $4000 more before the program is done in May 2015.

-No CC debt

-Car is paid off (though close to 200,000 miles and will need fairly major repairs soon, 1998 Honda Civic)

Assets:

-$4000 in checking

-$825 in savings

-$1230 in Roth IRA through Fidelity

Expenses:

-My portion of rent: $487.50/month

-My portion of utilities(water, electric, TV/internet): ~$80/month

-Food: $400-500 (includes groceries, eating out, bars, coffee, etc)

-Gas: $130/month

-Laundry: $15/month

-Netflix: $8/month

-Car Insurance: $461/paid every 6 months

-Cell Phone: $150/paid to my parents every 6 months (they still subsidize me a little on this)

-Doctor/Medicine: About $30/month if averaged over entire year

I was contributing $100/month to my IRA but my mom strongly suggested I stop that while I'm still in school so that I would have more to put in savings or toward tuition.  I'm conflicted, what do you all think?

Also, I will be starting my clinical internship in August.  It requires a total of 600 hours (and at least 20 hours/week, all unpaid).  I am still unsure as to whether I will keep my regular job during that time, as working 52 hours per week between two different mental health settings seems like a recipe for exhaustion, but I don't know where else I would get income except from taking out more student loans.  I suppose I will at least have to try to keep working during that time.

The starting salary for the average psychologist is about $40,000.  I could increase my earning potential significantly by becoming a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (also very interesting work) to probably about $60-70k, but it would cost an additional $11,000 in tuition.  If I had to take out more student loans for that (say at 6.8%), would the increased pay eventually be worth it?

Also, should I try to work part-time while going to school? I've been working part-time (making roughly $500/month) these last two years of my undergrad.

I've never received federal aid before because all of my scholarships have been through the state or my school, so I've never been aware of this fact before.

personalfinance,"Is the student loan auto-debit interest rate deduction a scam? (Help with interest rates, please)","My understanding about interest rates is a bit fuzzy so maybe someone here can help me out. I have federal student loans at 6.8% interest. For a while, I had been paying them manually every month, usually as far ahead of the due date as possible. The rationale for this was that the earlier in the monthly cycle I made my minimum payment, the more of that money was going to principal instead of interest (since interest accrues daily and federal loans prioritize interest payment first). My thinking was that by paying earlier in the month, I'd be chipping away at the principal faster and reducing my long term total interest payments.

Recently, I switched from making manual payments to an auto-debit arrangement. My loan payment is automatically debited from my bank account on the due date each month, at an interest rate deduction of .25%. At first this seemed like a smart move, because it lowered my interest rate from 6.8% to 6.55%. The problem is, now that my payments are automatic, they are not being made until the due date. So in theory I am paying way more towards interest than I am towards the principal (despite the actual rate being .25% lower), because I can no longer manually jettison my payments earlier in the month as soon as I have the funds to cover them.

I was thinking we should use the money from the sale of the car to pay down our student loans and take out a car loan. This would result in higher long term savings, but also higher monthly expenses. We could afford it from a month-month standpoint but don't have tons of extra income each month so it may result in less savings.

personalfinance,Graduating in 19 days. Scared to death of loans.,"Hi, PF. Long time lurker here. As the title says, I graduate from college at the end of April, and I fucked up big time.

I have a TON of loans. 18 year old me didn't think it would be a problem. Just sign your name on the line, right? Now that I'm seeing them, I'm frightened. I'd love to go back in time and pick a cheaper school, but obviously that won't work. Here's some quick facts on the loans I have:

* $33,166 in Federal loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized (11 total loans)
* $45,855.22 (current balance) through Discover Student Loans @ 3.25%
* $12,701 (current balance) through Discover @ 3.75%
* $1,600 in Federal Perkins Loans
* 1 additional from Sallie Mae (can't access right now, max value of $20,000)

The good news is that I already have a job lined up and start on May 19th. The job pays $46,030 per year before taxes. It's also at a non-profit hospital, and I believe that it qualifies for loan forgiveness after 10 years (from what the employees have mentioned). I'm still looking for apartments and will have a roommate to help alleviate some cost. I live in Pittsburgh, which is a relatively cheap city. Currently my parents cover my car insurance, phone, and car payment, but some of that may change.

I have never had to make a budget before, so I don't have anything planned as of yet to report. I'm here mostly looking for tips. It's scary as hell to see all of this now, and I don't really know where to start. I worry about paying too much on loans for the government and then my private loans going into delinquency/default, or vice versa.

So, PF, what kind of tips can you give me to keep my head above water?",finance,1396921893

WAYS OF THINKING ; Federal Budget Proposals Are Split Over Energy ; AMERICANS AND THE REST OF THE HUMAN RACE NEED A NEW SONG

Federal Budget Proposals Are Split Over Energy 4-4-14

The federal budget for energy and the environment may be tiny compared to giant programs like Social Security, Medicare and Defense, but it’s no less divisive, with Republican and White House proposals reflecting competing priorities.

As lawmakers discuss this week the Obama administration’s proposed $27.9 billion for the Department of Energy (DOE) and $7.9 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the House has developed a budget with far different prerogatives, leaving the Senate to iron out the differences next week.

The House fiscal 2015 budget resolution, passed on Wednesday with a 22-16 party-line vote, would cut spending on the federal government’s climate-change-related activities (WRONG), primarily activities overseas (LESS WRONG BUT STILL WRONG), and cut “duplicative and unnecessary” spending on climate-change-related activities (RIGHT), including EPA regulations aimed at the coal industry (WE NEED MUCH STRONGER RULES, RULES THAT WILL PUT THE COAL -AND OIL AND GAS- INDUSTRIES OUT OF BUSINESS). The budget would also reduce funding for renewable-energy programs and expand oil and gas development on federal land (ALL WRONG).

The president’s proposed budget, released last month, calls for nearly the opposite energy priorities. It would increase funding for climate-change programs and renewable-energy programs, including an energy-efficiency initiative aimed at supporting state efforts to modernize power grids, and it would cut funding for fossil-fuel research and methods of carbon capture in coal plants. (ALL RIGHT, BUT STILL SIDP WITH THE SONWS AND NO ACTWGFWHR))

The Senate Finance Committee will discuss the president’s budget Thursday morning. The Senate and House must agree to a budget before it is final, but later legislation authorizes actual spending. Both the House’s and the president’s budgets are considered guidelines for what will be a compromise.

As they prepare to debate the issues, both sides are busy honing their arguments and sharpening their swords.

“It is apparent programs to stop use of fossil fuels due to fears about climate change will accomplish nothing but waste more tax dollars,” said James Rust, policy adviser for the conservative think tank the Heartland Institute and a retired nuclear engineering professor from the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Such programs promote the use of renewable-energy sources like wind, solar, ethanol from corn, and other biofuels through research, subsidies and tax breaks. (ESSENTIAL)

The House budget resolution states that “all energy sources should be developed without undue government interference,” countering the Obama administration’s current and planned subsidies to renewable energy.

The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), the largest wind lobby in the U.S., is optimistic that the Senate will extend a wind production tax credit.

“Ultimately, on both sides of the aisle, they know this is a must-have because it means jobs and economic development back home,” Peter Kelley, vice president of public affairs for AWEA, said.

All 50 states and 70 percent of congressional districts have utility-scale wind farms or factories, according to AWEA. According to a Gallup poll released this week, 64 percent of Americans prefer an emphasis on alternative energy production like wind and solar over production of traditional fossil fuels, though renewable energy supplied just 12 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Renewable energy in the U.S. is simply not a priority for the government (WHICH IS TOTALLY WRONG), argues Steve Cohen, executive director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University,

“You have so many mandated requirements between health and welfare and Social Security and the military, you really don’t have anything left over,” he said. “And then you have an ideology that’s calling the federal government the problem. It’s unfortunate.”

Having grown up in Brooklyn, he remembers decades ago when the Hudson River looked like “a sewer.”

“Nobody wanted to go near it,” he said. Then environmental government agencies stepped in to regulate, and the air and water in New York is now at its cleanest in 25 years, he said. “Now you can ride your bicycle down there.”

“Saying that regulation kills jobs is like saying traffic lights kill cars,” he said. “The idea that all regulation is bad and bad for the economy is stupid.”

personalfinance,"26y/o: $115k salary, Max out my 401k, Roth, ~$17k Student Loans at 6% interest. Am I stupid to not pay off the loans right away?","On the fence about whether to pay off my students loans ($17k down from $30k 4 years ago) immediately or to start just making the minimum monthly payments. Any advice? 

A little about me: I am a very financially responsible person, and am really debt averse. I make $115k per year, I max out my 401k (comes out to $26,250 with employer match), have $120k in investments (stocks and mutual funds), max out my Roth, have $45k in company stock, $6k in cash, and currently do not pay any rent (I have a spare bedroom that I rent out which covers the entire rent). 

I feel like I have done all of the ""right"" things and am really only about 1 more year of my current situation (same pay + savings rate - expenses) from paying off my loans in full. However, I am very seriously considering buying an investment property while interest rates or so low, with the goal of ~ 12% per year return. Since my student loans are around 6%, to me it makes sense to opt for investing my extra money in real estate. I know the risk factor is 0 with paying off the loans, whereas the real estate is a lot higher, but a 6% difference in return makes me think it's worth it.

Aside from real estate, any other alternatives to holding off on paying down the student loans? Or am I being stupid to not just pay them off as soon as possible?",finance,1396924418

  MY JOURNAL/BLOG: WAYS OF THINKING The Tartars (WHO INCLUDE THE CRIMEAN TARTERS), once part of Genghis Khan's Mongol Hordes, are the second largest ethnic group in Russia. Stalin, a Georgian educated by the Jesuits to be a priest, used the ""tactics of the Seminary, surveillance, spying, invasion of the inner life (self and others), violation of feelings (self and others)..."" to rule Russia. ""Youthful rebellion is a grand gesture, an aesthetic style without a social core"". But when you preserve that ""rebelliousness"" with a later and well-developed ""social core"", it becomes less aesthetic and more practical, in the sense of world-changing. Real Leadership is about communicating directly to all the senses of those led. Like theater, it can result in disorientation -and ASCs/ altered states of consciousness. A man groped the ass of a Yonkers cop's wife in front of the cop at a bowling alley not far from where we live . How stupid can you get. Teachers' betrayals of students -sexual... abuse- is nation-wide and in public schools. Hillary Clinton wears the pants in her family because Bill cant keep his on. An NYPD Sgt. (a faggot) grabbed the rears of 6 cops. It is time we crushed homosexuality as well as those engaging in such perverse acts ; some alleged ""rights"" are totally wrong. It is a burden to be physically and psychologically broken, as I am. Moral amnesia imposed by government (such as today with the feminist, faggot and quasi-faggot filth and rot imposed by our debauched, amoral and decadent legal system and profession) results in societal (morale) breakdown. Fr. Louis Gigante is retiring from the South Bronx Development Board. He is the brother of the Gigante mob boss. They are both uncles of my St. Barnabas Grammar School classmate Louie Gigante, the owner of Mulino's Restaurant in White Plains and across from The Westchester County Office building. Greg DePalma. a capo in another Mob Family, was taken down by recordings the FBI made of his conversations at the Eastchester Diner. Coincidently, I spent a lot of time at the Diner reading and studying -the owner is a nice Greek guy, a Viet Nam veteran. Moreover, Greg used to golf at Leewood Golf Course in Eastchester -where I used to caddy and where I won a Caddy Scholarship to College. The Yonkers City Council banned ""problematic"" speakers from addressing the Council and, as I was one of those banned, Journal News Reporter Len Maniace called me for my opinion. And I think I told him they dont want to hear the truth. ""Alzheimers and the US Supreme Court"" is about the husband of my cousin, US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The Scarsdale Police Chief is my wife's cousin. ""Feel like a fraud ?"" As a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) survivor, such has plagued me since my TBI, nearly 50 years ago. TBI makes us survivors ""utilitarian"", ""opportunistic"", ""callous"", ""irresponsible""..., yet we have nothing to do with it. We are as shocked and disapproving as anyone else. Luck is what happens when a prepared individual encounters -and makes use of- emergent opportunity. There is a vast difference between things as they are and things as we name them. When I was younger, after my TBI (1963...) but before I even knew that I was a TBI survivor (which I learned in 1991), I used to love watching Kung Fu on TV. My main CIA, FBI, Army contact (we had lunch once a month for nearly 20 years), George L., lived in an apartment across the street from my law office in the Bronx. George once told me that, because my grandmother's name was Nestor, I was descended from Roman Emperors. When the legal profession was working on throwing me out of the Profession, one of the judges (female) at one of the hearings, an English Barrister, told me I was a Plantagenet (nor do I look all that different from Englanhd's Princes today). Ray Nagle, another classmate of mine at St. Barnabas Grammar School, was the Police Chief in White Plains, N.Y. When I first got out of Law School, I worked as a Veteran's Administration claims examiner. My father once observed that ""everything is relative"". As a TBI survivor, I had more mental problems (according to Psychiatry's Bible, the DSM) than all the child and spouse abusers...and all the dirtbag criminals I represented in the Family and Criminal Courts of NYS put together. One day when the AIDS crisis first hit, I was down at a 25 cents show when a guy wailed -as he ran from one of the booths- ""I just sat on someone's cum"". ALL shrinks always want to know what I think. But I do not ""think"", I just reflect on what I see and on what others do, like a mirror. As a TBI survivor, I am a peeping Tom in my own -and everyone else's- mind. Indeed, I've often watched myself caress and kiss beautiful women's breasts -even in Court interview rooms- with elation, awe, shock, bewilderment... Moreover, I am always ""outrageous"" -often calculatedly so. But I have nothing to do with it. My sense of right and wrong is constantly being flattened by a 10-ton truck and I ""betray"" myself second by second. My limited human consciousness mind is overwhelmed by non-conscious awareness resulting in constant flooding, ""inappropriatenesses"" -even shutdown. Defying all norms of morality -as my damaged brain does- undermines your opponents. Wisdom -being content- is about making peace with the unchangeable. Love -sexual love for and with a woman (your wife)- transforms your self-perceptions. Art and music are offensive and defensive weapons against despair and hatred. Below are 8 postings discussing, and including legal filings (starting in 2006) all the way up to the US Supreme Court, in my ongoing assault on America and its current feminist, faggot and quasi-faggot worldview.

personalfinance,Using Federal Grad loans to pay Private Student loans,"I took out a number of private loans from banks (Sallie Mae, Chase, etc.) when I was an undergrad to pay for school. This in addition to Federal Stafford loans. It was a mess, I made mistakes, taking loans out to help out my family with mortgage payments and my own apartment and just generally terrible financial planning. 

I am almost 5 years out of graduation, have been paying the loans back (with help from my parents) and am going back to Grad school this Fall. My funding package covers all my tuition costs for school, so I don't have to take any loans out and was not planning too.

However, I was offered a substantial amount of 'Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans' and 'Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loans' as part of the package. I am considering taking these loans to pay off the private loans, I wonder if this is a bad idea.

My reasoning is two fronts:

-The interest will be much lower (5.61-6.61% VS. 8.25-11.5% on the private loans) and will save me money in the long run.

-The federal government is much easier to work with than the banks in terms of repayment. They all income based repayment, deference, etc. 

I know student loans don't ever come off you  record, I know I will be paying them no matter what. I wonder though if 'transfering' the loans from high-interest bank loans to lower (though not low) interest Federal loans loans is a better financial idea.

personalfinance,How should I attack my student loan debt?,"Good morning all,

I've recently discovered the wonders of this sub, and have been...well...appalled at how much I didn't know about managing my money. So kudos to this community for just existing, and filling in the gaps for those of us who, for whatever reason, fell through the proverbial cracks.

At any rate, I have a number of federal student loans serviced by MOHELA. My monthly payment to all of these is about 345.00. Here's how they break down:

Subsidized Stafford 1- $2, 1603 @ 1.75%
Subsidized Stafford 2- $2, 807 @ 1.75%
Subsidized Stafford 3- $4,505 @ 6.8%
Subsidized Stafford 4- $4,506 @6.8%
Subsidized Stafford 5- $2,256 @ 6.0%
Unsubsidized Stafford 1- $4,061 @6.8%
Unsubsidized Stafford 2- $3,349 @ 6.8%
Unsubsidized Stafford 3- 951.60@ 6.8%

Obviously, it's not a debt I'm happy with carrying, and I'm trying to figure out a sensible way to attack it. Currently, I don't have much in the way of discretionary income (I'm paying for a master's degree out of pocket- I couldn't stomach taking another loan for it. And yes, the master's is necessary for Continuing Education Credits in my field).

However, I do have about $12k in savings which I had accumulated as an emergency fund (before I even discovered the term, so...I did that right, at least) , plus about $3k in checking as a result of tax returns and such.

My first thought is to go for the low hanging fruit and use the checking balance to pay off that last loan. I'm hesitant about tapping the emergency fund to help with this, though- should I be? Or is the wiser course to throw some of that at this debt as well? 

(For the record, no other debts- bought a used car and am renting at the moment.....but that's another story).

Any help the community can offer would be appreciated.

Edit: The loans are in deferment. However, interest still accrues on the unsubsidized ones.",finance,1396970917
personalfinance,Student Loans are seriously making my life difficult. Both Federal and Bank...,"A lot of this can be put on me for not thinking ahead, but I seriously don't know what to do here.  I'm working as much as I can right now, and while I don't have a job for my degree's caliber, I feel like my two jobs should be able to pay these loans, but they can't.  I'm still finding myself late or completely out of money.

I have an art degree in a major I didn't really want due to unforeseen circumstances while I was going through school.  Its a long story, but the gist of it is the major I wanted to be in required internships that they didn't help you find, you had to pay tuition to the school to have them count, and that were required to graduate.  I ended up switching majors in the last year to something I could graduate in.  Its been a few years since I got out of school, and I'm constantly struggling to pay these loans.  

I work two jobs, one where I work most the week and make about 15 bucks an hour and another which is freelance, and erratic, that I make about 18 an hour.  I have a third job coming up as well, but that's freelance too.  And it sounds like it may not be worth it.

I have two loans total, one federal and one bank.  The bank loan compounds around 370 dollars a month while the federal, if I don't defer, is around 330.

That's 700 a month that I just don't have.  I can defer the federal loan for the third time, but that still doesn't help with the bank loan which won't let me defer unless I declare bankruptcy.

I really don't think it should be this hard for me to live a normal life after college, with or without well-paying job, but it seems like it is.

I don't really know what to do from here... 

Can I get some advice?",finance,1396972123

personalfinance,"Hospital suggests I set-up Power of Attorney for my father, now what?","My father is currently within a skilled nursing facility. Based on their observations they have recommended that I establish power of attorney to manage his finances. 

Background:

He cannot walk without assistance due to a debilitating tumor that affected his sense of balance. From my understanding his current level of mobility is simply getting from the bed to and from the bathroom. He had received treatment that stopped its growth but there are some signs of confusion from him that suggest that it may be growing again. 

His wife has a history of substance abuse, and verbal / physical abuse. She has defaulted into a role of caretaker which my father has stated she resents. There have been reports from him of his wife giving him a shove to watch him fall then taunting about how lazy he is. Recently he called the local pd after an incidence which resulted in her being taken away in handcuffs, arraigned, and is set to have a court date in the coming months. In the meantime she has been back in the home. 

Last week it was reported that she had kept him locked in a bedroom and he hadn't been fed in three days. This prompted the outside family to call the local pd to conduct a wellness check of the home from which my father was taken to the hospital to be evaluated then to his current location in a skilled nursing facility. 

The wife has now informed my father that she will be separating from him. 

I do not have access to their home and am unfamiliar with what accounts my father might have, their balances, and which might have joint access. 

Challenges:

* What should I be taking into consideration regarding power of attorney? 

* What financial accounts should I look for? If my father is unable to provide information about his affairs, how do I go about tracking them down?

* Are there steps I can take as power of attorney to limit his wife's ability to clear out financial accounts pending their separation?

* How will an individual with power of attorney affect the divorce proceedings?

* Am I barking up the completely wrong subreddit, are there better suited places I should visit?

I have no idea how these loans, grants and scholarships work, or where to find them. I'm 20, and I live with my parents. I've been paying for school using solely my Federal Pell Grant (~$4000.) I've never worked a job before (discounting an unpaid internship with a local museum and two weeks of teaching electronics and chess at a summer camp.) Given my pretty much non-existent credit score, coupled with my parent's bad score (almost certainly less than the 600 score min I've heard is needed for private student loans), I don't think I'll be able to get much if any additional loans past Federal Stafford loans. I am approved for up to $2000 of work-study, however, which I plan to take advantage of. Assuming I get it, that would bring it all down to ~$3000. 

So...yeah. Any advice? If there are any VT grads in particular who might be able to help me, that would be especially useful - I haven't found any sort of application for scholarships besides their general scholarship application (which I filled out on February 20th, which I found out was too late.

Congressman Steve Stockman of Texas, who was the first member of Congress to accept bitcoin campaign donations, announced at Inside Bitcoins New York that he plans to introduce the first piece of U.S. legislation on virtual currencies called The Virtual Currency Tax Reform Act. The legislation would re-categorize virtual currencies as currency for IRS federal tax purposes.  Stockman says he hopes this bill will """"build awareness and create a consensus in the Bitcoin community around government regulation of virtual currencies.""""

Also today at Inside Bitcoins New York, multi-signature security company BitGo announced the launch of BitGo Enterprise, a new suite of services for businesses and financial institutions operating in digital currency. As Will OBrien puts it, the service offers enterprise ""the power to securely store and effectively manage Bitcoin holdings”.

Governor of the Bank of Japan Haruhiko Kuroda expressed his doubts about bitcoin at a central bank policy meeting today, saying that “Without safety or stability in its value, there would be no demand. In that sense, it cannot be a currency.” And Capitol Hill is getting its first bitcoin ATM today. A new Robocoin ATM machine will be unveiled to members of Congress this afternoon, where they can buy and sell bitcoin.

Word of a new web bug has spread over the past twelve hours, this time in OpenSSL, which is an encryption library widely used by websites to encrypt and secure internet traffic. The new bug, coined the Heartbleed bug, allows anyone on the Internet to access a service provider's data, as well as users' names and passwords, if their systems are protected by vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. While major bitcoin companies Blockchain, Coinbase and BitPay appear to be safe from this bug, several others are finding themselves at risk. Exchange BitStamp announced today that they are temporarily deactivating account registration and withdrawals while they work to patch their system. And Bitfinex likewise halted withdrawals on their exchange this morning. LocalBitcoins also suffered some recent downtime while patching the bug.

Despite the recent price drop, industry leaders at today's Inside Bitcoins NY conference remain optimistic about the future of the digital currency. SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert remains particularly bullish, telling others at the event that we will be seeing another major price bubble once Wall Street investors gain enough confidence in the institutional infrastructure to throw their money into the pot.

Eric Holder commented on Bitcoin today while speaking to the House Judiciary Committee. He warned that ""Virtual currencies can pose challenges for law enforcement given the appeal they have among those seeking to conceal illegal activity."" Mr Holder however is not calling for an end to Bitcoin, but instead on keeping the government abreast of the technology saying, ""The department is committed to innovating alongside this new technology in order to ensure our investigations are not impeded by any improvement in criminals' ability to move funds anonymously.""

Bitcoin,Why the 'revolutionary' aspect of Bitcoin is important to technological progress,"I'm quite encouraged by this community to see that the majority of us, at least at this point, are still ideologically driven. Our common ideology being **neutrality**. 

Let me explain;

The current system is **biased**. It only works for some and then to varying degrees based on their ""cast"" in society. The poorer and less connected you are, the higher interest (as an example) you pay for things. The more you suffer from inflation etc. If you live in a country where your countrymen perhaps have created a distrustful situation, you are likely being locked out of the financial system to some degree. Perhaps you are being locked out because the politicians on one place of the map dislike the politicians on your place on the map. 

Another aspect of the bias is that certain entities get near infinite funding with the consequent devaluation of the money held by the rest of society. ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"".

Regardless of our proposed politics. Most of us feel a sense of disgust at the bias of the existing system. Personally I believe that if we were to pull that thread to its end we will discover the non-aggression principle lying there. But that is not necessary for us to make common cause. 

**Ideology is important because it motivates more than money;** Take the following hypothetical situation: The US Federal government outright bans buying cryptocurrency. The result would be a bunch of furious geeks who will pour in their extra hours into opensource solutions to make that ruling untenable. Some of us would be so furious we might downscale our standard of living to right such an injustice. (Amir Taaki's group as an example)

To my knowledge this type of activism has not existed before. We've had hacktivism before, but those were isolated protests that frustrated the beast. Things like TOR and Bitcoin have the capacity to stab it in the heart. Before Bitcoin those geeks would have been angry but there was no president that such activism might be successful. To be honest, before it *actually worked* even I would have thought Satoshi's ambitions were delusional (and I'm pretty delusional).

To divorce Bitcoin and the larger revolution from extreme ideologies is to rip out its heart in the name of leaving a meaty corpse.

personalfinance,"New grad, $95K student loans in 2.75% ARM, $50K salary, can you comment on my financial plan?","Hey everyone, I'm a 25 year old new grad with the above numbers.  I will have $78K in an adjustable rate home equity line from my parents and $17K in subsidized Stafford loans upon graduation in May.  Upon graduation I will immediately roll the Stafford loans (6.8%) into my home equity line resulting in $95K at current interest rate of 2.75%.  My salary will be $50K and I will be living in New Hampshire.  I'm currently single but in a committed relationship.

Right now I am living very comfortably on $1500/month as a student, although my costs will increase once I move to New Hampshire since I currently share a 1BR apartment with my girlfriend.  I expect my overall costs to be around $1800/month, leaving me with $1300-1400 to:

1. Pay down student loans
2. Max out Roth IRA
3. Reduce tax burden by contributing to 403(b) - no employer match

I also have $5k in stocks and ETFs.  I'm in the medical field and expect a big increase in salary after 3-6 years depending on how I decide to specialize.  Once the salary increase comes, I will destroy the student loan ASAP.

**My question is, how should I shuffle those priorities to be in the best financial position?**  My long term goals are to get married, have kids and fully fund their educations before they graduate high school, and retire very comfortably.  In the short term the biggest potential cost is getting married.

Now if my loan were fixed-rate, it would be a no-brainer - I would pay minimally to the student loans and invest the rest.  However, the fact that those loans are adjustable-rate makes me a little nervous.

Currently my plan is to pay $900/mo to student loans, max out a Roth IRA (since my future income will disqualify me), and put leftovers into 403(b) to try and get my tax bracket closer to the 15% range.  Am I correct in thinking that next year I could actually just roll all of my stocks and ETFs into a Roth IRA, freeing up additional income to throw into the 403(b)?  With the $50K salary and $6200 standard deduction, I would need another ~$7K into 403(b) to get fully into the 15% tax bracket.  Realistically that would be very hard to do.  In summary my plan for my first year is this:

* Have $400 deducted per month from gross pay into 403(b)
* Roll my current investments into a Roth IRA and pad it with a few bucks throughout the year to max it out.
* Pay $900 to student loans
* Live on $1800

personalfinance,Paying student loans for a year but my balance is still going up.,"I just realized this while looking at my credit reference letter for a mortgage. I've been paying student loans for over a year and I've paid 1 of 7 off completely with targeting extra payments. The other 5 balances have went down even if only a little yet this one loan went from $2000 to $2108.41 because of 6.8% interest and too low of payments.

So basically I trusted them to set up the payments and here I am just getting more debt. Do I email them to change the payments around? I can afford a little more. Or should I give up trusting them and just pay extra specifically to that loan like I did the other? They're all through myfedloan and I can pay them off early with no penalty, I just can't pay it all at once so it's $100 here and there thanks to subs like this and /r/Frugal.",finance,1397057366
personalfinance,I'm considering helping my parents refinance their home so that I can use some of the equity to pay towards student loans (Essentially refinancing them). Is this a bad idea?,"Alright, so here's my situation. 

I will soon be graduating from college. I have about 100k in parent PLUS loans, which we agreed before school that I would pay back (I know I have no legal obligation). The interest rate for them is 7.9%, and since they are parent PLUS loans, it doesn't seem like anywhere would be willing to refinance them. I don't care too much about the other benefits that federal loans offer, since I am mostly focused on paying them off as soon as possible (I already secured a job with an $80k salary).

So, it recently became known to me that my parents are looking to refinance their home to make some repairs on it.  It's not a super valuable home, probably around 160k, but they only owe about 50k. However, they don't have the best credit since they did have a previous foreclosure about 5 years ago.

Somewhere in talking we thought of the idea of possibly adding me on the title of the house and using my credit in addition to theirs to try to get their refi. It seems like a win-win since we would try to take out 80% of the equity and use some for their repairs and the rest to pay down my loans. It probably wouldn't cover all of my loans, but it would at least lower that 7.9% interest rate.

I have pretty good credit, but only 5 years of history. I currently have 2 credit cards that are usually paid in full each month, and I have never missed a payment. The last time I checked my credit score, it was around 790, and I would assume it has only gone up since then. 

I guess my question to you guys is whether or not this is a good idea, or if it is even feasible in the way I've imagined it? Would my credit be good enough to get us a loan with less than 5% interest (California)?

Any input would be greatly appreciated. I guess I should also note that my parents and I are on good terms. This is an idea we came up with together, so it's not like they are trying to screw me over.",finance,1397059250

* Loans (home loans, car loans, etc.)
* Micro-loans for shibepreneurs
* Interest-earning saving accounts to avoid inevitable inflation
* Connecting shibes to legit charities
* Safeguard dogecoins (like online wallets)
* Shibes collect interest
* Simple user interface to all the different places to tip (shibes don’t have to learn different syntaxes for different websites)
* Be flexible about loan collateral accepted (domain names, twitter handles, etc.)
* This is a legit non-profit; and so there are greater opportunities to obtain grants/donations for funding different efforts

**What we're looking for:**

Feedback so that we can see if there's interest in the idea. And we're looking in particular for shibes with experience in non-profits as well as credit unions and banks.

**Our plan going forward:**

* Gauging interest. If there's enough interest to move forward,
* Make a plan for board composition and entity formation.
* Assemble board of directors, and incorporate. 
* Begin fundraising for initial startup expenses.

A NJ federal district court judge has affirmed the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to sue companies for alleged cybersecurity failures by denying a motion from Wyndham Worldwide Corp. to dismiss an FTC suit. This is significant to the Bitcoin community because it puts U.S. based exchanges and other businesses on the hook should there be a breach, something that's been common in our world.

personalfinance,"Debt Repayment Question. NOT student loans. This is straight-up DEBT to a University. And, know anything about Tuition Management Systems (TMS)?","THANK YOU! Thank you so much for reading this and letting me know your thoughts! I really appreciate it.

So, I have depression and I ignored all of my finances for most of the last year after I dropped out of graduate school after one semester.  This wasn't a wise move (ignoring my finances), but it is what happened and I take responsibility. I am not dwelling in the past on this, but focusing on today and the future and what I can do to sort this out.  I have a job. And I have very low expenses.  Although I only make about $10 an hour, I have about $600 (or more) left over at the end of every month.

I have $2400 in savings. This is 4 months of living expenses. It is my ""emergency fund"".

I've gotten everything sorted out with getting up to date on my federal loans ($4000).  I'm way a head of schedule and I don't owe any outstanding payments.  I'm thinking of maybe paying the minimum + whatever money is left over at the end of every month towards this loan. This loan is not my priority at the moment.

But I also have about $1800 in debt to the University.  This debt is **bad** debt to have. The interest rate is 1% (levied monthly on the 15th) so the annual rate is like 12% (*but it is actually even more, see below*). **OUCH!**  I have 3 options for this debt. Option One: pay it off before the end of the month. Option Two: do nothing (and they'll have collections agencies on my ass). Or, Option Three, (their preference) enter into a ""payment plan"" with a third-party service called TMS (Tuition Management Systems). Anyone know about these guys? My understanding of the payment plan is that I will pay 1% interest on the 15th of every month. The terms of the plan are for 6 months and it costs $30 to begin a new 6-month term if it isn't paid off after 6 months.

So, what should I do?

My current plan is as follows: wire $600 to the university tomorrow. (This leaves me with $1800 in E-Fund, or 3 months of expenses). Then, go on the T.M.S. payment plan at $250/month. If I do this, I will pay off this debt on 5 months. Then, I can focus all of that money on my federal loan.

Is this a decent plan?  I think with this plan I will be able to put $150 into saving per month (recouping my $600 payment in 4 months) and $200 towards my federal loans per month.

Thoughts?  

**FINALLY**, I'm a little bit worried that going on a ""payment plan"" is going to wreck my credit. My credit score is about 750, so I don't really want to hurt it that much.  Would being on a ""payment plan"" with TMS hurt, help or not harm my credit score?  Is this enough of an issue that I would consider either (1) really eating into my savings big-time or (2) begging my parents for a loan to pay off the university (the $1800) and then paying my parents off over the next 5 months.  Really, I hate both of those options and am totally OK with the payment plan, unless I learn some really negative thing about this sort of payment plan.

personalfinance,Considering doing some refinancing. Help.,"Hi, PF! (This is very specific)
I'm a fairly frugal and have a good management of my finances. I have a pretty good job, with very good pay in a state where the cost of living is very low. Here are the questions that I have, some are far-fetched in that they are very specific, but I figured... what the hell. 

I have a car loan with a credit union, not the bank that I normally bank with, because the interest rate was fairly low 2.99%APR. However, being that my pay goes to my primary bank, there are times when sending my payments to the credit union that holds my loan from my bank, it may be a day or two late, simply due to processing. So my first question is, how much does being 1 or 3 days late on a car payment affect me? 

Now, here's the very specific part of my question: I bank with USAA, but I am not a military member, and although my father was in the military, he never had a USAA account and therefore I can't be a ""full member"". This makes me ineligible for their auto insurance, (although when I get married, since my fiance is a full member, that will change, but I digress.... to the matter at hand). 

Would refinancing my already low rate, in order to have my loan in the same financial institution where I bank be a good idea? The main reason is not saving money in the refinance, but the credit union that has my car loan takes FOREVER to process payments, and the other day I received a letter saying that my payment was late.....but it was clearly a processing error on their fault. The main thing I want to do is avoid these disruptions which my affect my credit. So.... refinance with USAA (which I don't know if I'm even elegible, so I'm hoping someone here is familiar with USAA). Again, very specific, but I figured it was worth a shot.",finance,1397104835

I have about $38k in debt from undergrad borrowing. That garnered me two degrees,  albeit ones that are not particularly in high demand or high earning. So I decided to go back to school in fall 2014, which led me to...

I have been accepted into The New School for Social Research in order to study their MSc of Economics program. I'm absolutely thrilled, however I realize now that their program, being an elite insitution in NYC, is rather expensive. By my rough calculation, my 45 credits there will cost about $91k.

-How much can I borrow from the federal government before I'm cut off from their loans and have to fill the gap with private loans?
-If I borrowed all of the money that I need to finish my education, I'll be at around ~$140k in debt for all my education. That seems like a godawful amount of money. How much should this concern me?

personalfinance,General Advice: I'm starting to lose control of my budget.,"Sorry, there's about to be a large amount of information, so if you don't want to read it, feel free to hit back. I won't be offended...

This past week I had a check bounce for the first time in my life. Normally I'm pretty good about budgeting my money, but obviously I missed something this week. On Tuesday, a check that I had written back in February cleared and I didn't have the money to cover it. Of course that started the horrible every-check-after-that-bounces chain and I had just sent off a few others for some regular monthly bills. I had a second one bounce this morning before I was able to do damage control to prevent it. Point is: I feel like I am normally pretty good about keeping my budget in check, but lately I think I'm falling off the wagon. 

How can I get things back on track and stick to my budget?

Currently I am a student full time and I work part time at my university for minimum wage. 
I've tried finding a better paying job, but every time I do, my grades start to tank. The other benefits of working on campus are that I can avoid driving my car at all, which means I don't have to pay for gas and I spend next to nothing on maintenance. For some reason riding the bus also keeps me from being late to class. If I miss the bus I'll be at least 15 minutes late waiting for the next one, so I'm pretty good about getting to classes on time for fear of being super-late, which helps me keep my grades up. And working at my university is really flexible as far as my schedule goes, since it changes every semester. The downsides are: obviously, minimum wage. $7.25/hr sucks hard, but I've made it work in the past and I would really like to make it work for now. The other downside is that because I'm a student and an employee of the university, I'm am only allowed to work up to 30hrs/wk, so there is a limit to how much I can make each month and there's no such thing as overtime.

Recently I started working more hours, so my paychecks are getting larger, but I feel like things could very quickly get out of hand.

Here is my income:
~$750/month (this is an estimate based on my new schedule, I don't officially know that this is what I'll be making.)
I also have a savings account that is funded by the grants I get to go to school. I try to leave them in the account and maintain a balance of at least $1000, but I do dip in periodically if my paycheck was small or if I have other things come up. Right now I have about $1400 in it.

Monthly Expenses:
I have two student loans, one private (Sallie Mae) and one federal Stafford loan. The private loan balance right now is $3400 and my minimum monthly payments are $25, but I've been trying to pay $60-100 in hopes of lowering the balance.
My federal loan balance was originally $7250, but it's been accruing interest so now it's sitting at $7800. I'm not required to make payments on this one, but I would really like to get them paid off. This is the only debt I've ever had and it really stresses me out, so I'd like to get it taken care of as soon as I can afford it. 
In the past, I would set a budget and stick to it for several months, but eventually something would happen and I would let things get out of hand, never to the point of bouncing a check, but I definitely wasn't as careful as I should have been. 
Rent - $275
Phone bill - $40
Utilities - ~$35-60/month, lately closer to $30-40
Car insurance - $72 (if I can afford it, I pay the policy off at the beginning of the period, but this is what my monthly payment will be in May when my policy renews.)
Food - $150 (I cook a lot as long as I keep food in our house, but this is probably the hardest thing to stick to)
Other necessities (pet food, toilet paper type things, laundry detergent, personal expenses like occasional haircuts, and random things like car maintenance, etc...) - $100

Just adding up that list, I'm going to be in the red or right at my income. When I'm really in a bind, my boyfriend is able to help me, but he has his own student loans to worry about. His balance is vastly greater than mine, but he doesn't pay his phone bill, or car insurance. He also makes a fair bit more than I do, but I would really like to be able to get through my regular monthly expenses without his help.

My goal is to be able to pay $60-$100 on my private loan and eventually start working on paying off my federal loan. Have I been going about this all wrong? Should I have used my grants to pay my student loans off more quickly and avoid interest but then not have the buffer of a savings account? Is having a low-stress job and good grades not worth the trouble of earning only minimum wage? I'm trying to power through school because I receive Hazlewood benefits that will no longer be available to me when I turn 25, so I'm taking a heavy course load and it is only going to get tougher in the fall when I start my 3000 and 4000 level classes.

Any advice would be welcome! I feel like my weaknesses are the occasional coffee splurge and not bringing my lunch more often. Any other tips on cutting my expenses or just general financial advice?

Edit: If my grades drop, I lose my grants. My grants have been ~$3000 per semester in the past and they have really saved my butt, but it varies according to my classes and credit hours.
I also don't have health insurance, so all my medical bills are paid out of pocket. In fact, I still have a bill for lab work from a routine yearly ""women's wellness"" exam last year. I haven't paid it because I keep forgetting and I can't really afford to and I didn't agree with the charges in the first place, but those are all stupid ~~reasons~~ excuses and because of it, I haven't gone back to the doctor this year to get my yearly exam (I think I feel guilty for not paying it and made an unspoken agreement with myself that I wouldn't go to a doctor until I had paid that bill in full.) The bill is $230. I also wear glasses and haven't been to an optometrist in over four years. I have an appointment on Friday, but I'll be using money from my savings to pay for the visit and then ordering the cheapest set of frames I can find online.
Before anyone goes crazy and starts shouting Obamacare, I filled out the form on the website like I'm supposed to and they estimated my yearly income to be $9000, which is accurate. I am not even required to file federal income taxes. But they estimated my income to be $9000, and then the only insurance plans available had monthly payments of $149 and a $6000 deductible.

personalfinance,Two years to prepare: The prospect of $175k for an MBA degree,"**Background**

Its coming to the point in my life where I need to start looking at what I will do in the coming years after I finish my masters degree.  An MBA is not a definite, but it is highly likely in 2-3 years.  I'd like to keep this discussion away from hard numbers, because I imagine there are other people in a similar situation.  

I would like this to be a discussion of strategy, alternatives, and trying to be in the best situation possible (relative) 5-7+ years from now.

As a little background on myself, I am 25 years old currently working as an engineer and pursuing my masters degree in electrical engineering part time.  I should complete it 1 year from now, after next year's Spring semester.  At this point I do not expect my current employer to adequately compensate me for my worth.  Thus I will be in a new position and paying back ~$10k of tuition reimbursement to the company.

**Plan**

I have just finished paying off my undergraduate debt and only owe $9k on my car.  I do not plan on paying this off in a rapid fashion.  Rather my goal is to build cash over the next 2-3 years. $10k of this may be required to pay off my debt to the company. 

In a few years I will have a pool of money that I can use from

* Roth IRA
* Cash Savings
* Taxable Mutual fund

This money will possibly be used for my MBA degree or a house.  I'm not yet sure what % of my MBA I will fund through loans or my own cash savings.  Part of that decision will depend on the interest rates at the time.

I understand people's first reaction will be ""why are you using retirement funds for a house/school"".  My response to that:  I decided to invest in a Roth IRA because it was my intent to save money for the future whether it be retirement, a home, or school.  I couldn't afford to save as much as i'd like for retirement, but I might as well take advantage of this space while I can.  If i don't need this money for a house/school, it could then be used for retirement.

**Questions/Points to discuss**

When pursuing a MBA, what percentage of the degree would you pay for in cash vs borrow?

I know a part-time MBA, or lower cost one is an option as well; however, most of what I here says that to be really worth it I should get one from a top school (i.e.Harvard, Columbia,Yale, MIT, Chicago,Wharton).

There is the option to not pursue an MBA at all.

Bitcoin,Refundable Bitcoin Transaction,"I have been working on a way of making Bitcoin transactions reversible, i.e., taking the fearful risk of sudden loss out of Bitcoin.

There are a few things that I worry about: 

1) It creates a central regulating body. In other words, anyone who uses my Bitcoin exchange can reverse transactions. Bitcoins can be put into the exchange, but only fiat currencies can be removed (BTC to fiat @ market_value). I believe that this would make a trust issue.

2) Transferring from free circulating BTC (cBTC) to protected BTC (pBTC) is instantaneous, whereas, pBTC to cBTC is not. The goal is to prevent fraudulent chargebacks, while still providing security for BTC investors. It also takes time to convert from pBTC to fiat currency (transactions must be reviews, and validated; a maturation time of 3 days is required for each pBTC to fiat conversion).

Is it useful? The code is in Python (at the moment), but I can port it to C#/C++/Java. 

Please let me know what you all think. The end goal is to convert BTC to a recognized currency, instead of a bartering item. If we have some form of transaction history, we can help ease the minds of our federal regulators.

personalfinance,Repaying a Student Credit Line vs. Government Loan (Canada). Please help!,"Hey guys, first time poster here looking for some help on which loan I should stick to during my repayment period. In undergrad, I didn't qualify for a government loan (interest free during studies) so I had to result to a student line of credit from the bank. In my last year, and also in this first year of my graduate program, I was able to qualify for a Gov student loan, and essentially put the whole thing onto what I owed on my credit line to avoid paying more interest. However, my credit line is such that the full $40, 000 is still available to me if needed. **I graduate in August of 2015 from my Master's program and am essentially wondering which loan, either my student line of credit or government loan, would be a better deal for me.** Let's just say that by the time I graduate I will have $25, 000 of debt. I will also be employed full time, pulling in about $3500 net/monthly. Here are the details below:

Total Debt owing: $25, 000

**Option 1) Student Line of Credit from Bank**
  
* One year grace with interest payments only - Interest at prime (3%) + 1%
* During repayment period, interest jumps to prime (3%) + 3.5%

**Option 2) Government Loan**

* 6 month grace period with interest payments on federal loan portion only
* 60% of the loan is federal - interest is either fixed at prime (3%) + 5% or floating at prime +2.5%
* 40% of the loan is provincial - interest is fixed at prime (3%) + 1%

I know there are loan repayment calculators, but the federal/provincial split between the government loan complicates matters. Again, I am wondering which option is better for my repayment plan or if I should use some combination of the two.

personalfinance,Student Loan Prepaid Status,"Ok.  I have three federal student loans from two organizations.  I've been throwing all my extra money at them lately, and my accounts now state they are in pre-paid status.  Basically, this keeps pushing my next due date farther down the road.  

I'm confused how this affects my total interest burden.  I can't be charged for interest that hasn't accrued yet, so it seems like the same total interest in the end?  But I just made an $850 payment to an account that was already paid through the month and several more, and of that $850, $15 went to interest.  I called the organization and asked them to apply extra payments entirely to principle, so they removed the pre-paid option and advised me I would have another due-date soon.  Great.  I'll have that loan paid off within two months and will start avalanching on to the next.
 


Then I called the other organization.  I asked the same thing and was told that not going pre-paid isn't an option, but they must always satisfy accrued interest first and then apply to principle, but all my extras will go to principle.  So was he wrong?  Are they ripping me off for extra interest, or would it all be the same?  Please explain, I feel like a dumbass here.

Bitcoin,"Summary of the DATA annual meeting, April 10, 2014","I was at the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) annual meeting today. Can't give you all the details of conversations, but I'll give an overview of the speakers, panels, and general sentiment.

**Keynote**

David Andolfatto, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis academic, gave the opening talk. It was a high level, but interesting, talk about what money is (a ledger) and how digital currencies are a natural evolution. However, he didn't think Bitcoin was good money, because it had an inflexible supply, and someone needed to manage the money supply (like the Fed). He was generally positive about Bitcoin (he specifically said it was ""a stroke of genius"") but didn't think it could really compete with centrally planned money.

**First Panel**

The first panel was about the evolution of money and had Susan Athey, econ prof from Stanford. She had some good insights about data mining the blockchain. John Clippinger from MIT Media Lab had some great thoughts about managing identities and maintaining privacy while still giving regulators what they need. David Schwartz, cryptographer from Ripple labs, didn't add much but had good thoughts. The panel was rounded out by Erik Voorhees, who was excellent as always and presented the liberty position well.

**Second Panel**

The next panel was about remittances as a use case. Jerry Brito from Mercatus and Michael Faye from GiveDirect talked about how digital currency could disrupt, particularly in Africa. A good nuanced point that came out was the idea that even though Bitcoin clearly has benefits over speed and cost of existing systems, for remittances having local agents is incredibly important and building those networks is very difficult.

**Third Panel**

The third panel was about merchants, and was one of the better panels. Jonathon Johnson, Chairman of Overstock.com, talked extensively about Overstock's decision and the results so far. He mentioned something I didn't know: Overstock doesn't convert 100% of bitcoin to fiat, they keep 10%. They do this because some employees have requested payment in bitcoin, and they want to pay eventually. He also mentioned that they were going to work with vendors to try and pay them in bitcoin.

Also on the panel were Tony Gallipi from Bitpay and Martine Niejadlik from Coinbase, who explained what their companies do. Tony gave a good response to a Dogecoiner who basically asked why they don't accept anything but Bitcoin, walking him through their decision framework for accepting currencies.

**Fourth Panel** 

The fourth panel was a bunch of regulators. As Erik Voorhees said, they were basically all just talking about why their jobs are so important. I won't list all the people, but it was the SEC, IRS, staffer for a Senator, Terrorist Financing something or another, and a State Banking Supervisor.

The only thing interesting here was that the IRS lady got some pretty pointed questions, and had fluffy answers in response. Compared to merchants and developers, the regulators spoke in generalities and were pretty boring.

**Speech on Law Enforcement Considerations**

Stuart Tryon from the US Secret Service gave an incredibly boring and uninformative presentation about...what the Secret Service does, I guess. It wasn't really related to digital currencies at all and everyone was just waiting for lunch to start by that point.

**Lunch**

It was pretty good.

**Fifth Panel**

This panel was about the global view of bitcoin. David Johnston from BitAngels had good comments about the benefits of bitcoin to other countries.

**Last Panel**

The last panel was about consumer protection and privacy, and was another good panel. Joshua Fairfield, professor of law was very knowledgeable about bitcoin (and surprisingly, sidechains), and had good thoughts. Berin Szoka, from TechFreedom, was very direct in saying that bitcoin could deliver on the promise of revolutionizing government that the original internet advocates promised in the early 90's.

We then finished with workshops about various areas, I was in the privacy workshop. Academic types wanted to know how we could work with regulators to comply only when necessary, the tech types were basically saying that the cat is out of the bag and any attempts to tie identity to addresses would be rejected by the community and wouldn't be technologically feasible.

**Conclusion**

In general, regulation was a major theme, whether or not the self-regulation model of DATA was sufficient or if more regulation was needed from government. Most seemed to recognize that technology specific regulation is a bad idea, but other than a few tech types everyone bought the premise that complete anonymity isn't a good thing, so the talk was how to apply existing regulation like anti-money laundering and know your customer laws in the least restrictive way.

Overall, it was good for networking and for the community to show the regulators that we aren't all radical, and hope they leave us alone...at least until the network effects are too strong to take down. Then we can be radical.",cryptocurrency,1397176740
personalfinance,[Q] How is IBR/PAYE reflected on credit report &amp; will loan consolidation improve my score?,"Hi all,

Sorry for this very long post. I had a several questions that I was unable to get any goods answers to, despite spending several hours researching and on the phone with my loan provider. I was hoping somebody with some personal experience or more educated than myself could provide some guidance!

I recently finished grad school with approximately $160k of student loans. The loans are all Direct / Grad Plus loans, which are reflected on my credit report as 13 installment loan accounts (this is a result of the way loans were dispersed each semester and the fact that credit reporting bureaus treat student loans as installment loans).

Before the grace period expired, I enrolled in the Federal ""Pay As You Earn"" (PAYE) income-driven repayment program. At the time I enrolled, I was still looking for work; therefore, since I had no income, my monthly payment amount is $0 per month until I resubmit my annual documentation next year.

I finally found a job in my field two months ago, and my wife and I are now looking for a home. When I checked my credit report, it had the loans listed as being deferred. After a few phone calls, it seems that the credit bureaus interpreted my $0 monthly payment as my loans being deferred, even though my loan provider sent them a letter saying I was in repayment. A few more phone calls, and now my credit report says that I am indeed in repayment, but it also states that I owe the regular 10-year repayment amount each month - not the amount I actually owe each month under the Pay As You Earn Program.

The problem still doesn't seem to be fixed, and it is pretty much ruining my wife and I's chance of getting a house because the debt-to-income ratio is too high under the 10-yr repayment plan as compared to PAYE. I am considering consolidating my loans and resubmitting documentation to start paying under the PAYE program; however, I had a few questions first.

So my questions are:

**(1) If I am repaying my loans under PAYE, will the monthly amount owed under that program be reflected on my credit report?** I'm not quite sure whether the current problem I'm having is the result my currently owing $0 each month causing wonky errors in my report, or if credit reports will always show the full 10-yr amount owed regardless of actual amount owed/paid under income-driven repayment plans like PAYE or IBR.

**(2) Will consolidating my student loans improve my credit score?** Currently, I'm getting dinged a little because my credit report shows my student loans as 13 installment loans. From what I've gathered, it seems that consolidating these into one loan can improve my score because the other loans are treated as being paid off. However, I've also read conflicting information saying that the loans are just treated as being ""transferred"" (rather than paid), and it can actually hurt your credit because you are opening a new loan.

**(3) If I do consolidate my loans, what affect will that have on the total balance?** Specifically, will all the currently accrued interest be rolled up into the new loan, or will the new loan start out with a balance of accrued interest? My concern is that since there in a 10% interest cap (which I think I'm at already), I really don't want to reset that clock.

**(4) I'm currently working in a public interest job. Assuming one of the new budget proposals goes through that caps the Public Service Loan Forgiveness amount, would consolidating my loans affect my ability to potentially be grandfathered into the current unlimited PSLF?** In other words, if I am currently considered eligible for the program due to being a new borrower as of Dec. 2009, would consolidating my loans in effect make it so that I am considered a new borrower as of today (April 2014)? The concern is that if Congress does allow people to be grandfathered in, I don't want to risk losing out if consolidation effectively resets my borrowing start date.",finance,1397176811

This revolutionary decision is in partnership with renowned contemporary artist Dana Louise Kirkpatrick, and her exclusive Bitcoin inspired artwork ‘Off Limits but Blessed by the Fed’ 

Dana Louise Kirkpatrick (b. 1976, Cambridge, Massachusetts) is an artist gaining rapid renown for her bold, large-scale artworks in mixed media. Her work references elements of Modern art, in particular German and Neo-Expressionism. She grapples with the dichotomies and contradictions embedded in contemporary
Western culture, religion and humanity, using forceful    iconography and a highly expressive technique.

Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment  system and completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is essentially digital cash. 

KM Fine Arts is leading the pack into the digital future, as the popularity and value of Bitcoins increase so will their universal adoption, making KM Fine Arts a trailblazer how we accept payment for goods.

The Silicon Valley Contemporary is the perfect place for this landmark transaction to take place, as all the newest technological advances that are impacting art practices around the world will all be on display.

Bitcoin,The best Bitcoin movie is Ghostbusters,"It's about a group of like minded people who find a solution to a problem (Fiat money system). The thing is, most people don't believe that problem exists, even when they experience the problem first-hand (inflation, QE, etc), they dismiss it as something else. The group is seen as a joke until they start capturing more and more ghosts (gaining value and acceptance). Then this gets the attention of government regulators who listen to critics that say they are making the whole thing up(Claims Bitcoin is a Ponzi). The regulator (governments like China and US) has no experience dealing with ghosts (Bitcoin) or busineses that deal with capturing and storing ghosts (BTC Exchanges) so he shuts them down. This causes not only the business to go under, but releases all sorts of bad shit (FUD, price crash).

personalfinance,Should I start investing before I've paid off my debts? (AU),"Hi all, I need some brainstorming help on this one from people who are better at this than I am please! 

I've been lugging around a fairly large unsecured debt for the past few years and have got it down to around the $60k mark now. 

It is divided across a variety of credit cards and loans at interest rates that vary from 1.55% (15 month cc balance tfer) up to 13.84% (4 year personal loan). On average, the interest rate across all the debts is 10.36%.

My usual approach is to pour the debts (in particular the credit cards) back and forth between balance transfers once or twice a year to maintain the lowest interest rates possible, while keeping a managable number of accounts and keeping an eye on the account fees etc. 

I make sure I put any spare money straight on to the debts with every paycheck, which usually means I'm paying off at least an extra $500 every month (sometimes as much as $1000 extra per month depending on what bills I have due).

I'm wondering if it wouldn't be a bad idea to slow down on the extra repayments for a while and consider investing in some blue chip shares. I was thinking of a [CBA share pack](https://www.comsec.com.au/Public/Products/SharePacks.aspx) for about $4k, which to me seems a fairly conservative investment that has a good chance of earning more interest than I'm accumulating on the debt. 

Is my logic flawed? Am I fooling myself to think that I can get that much return on investment when I don't know what I'm doing?",finance,1397193631

personalfinance,Want to get some info on what credit card to choose to help increase my credit.,"My current financial situation is that I'm making around 60k a year at my 
first job.  No car payments, renting a house, and I have 30k in student loans. 
My work currently is paying for 20k of those loans over the course of 2 years, 
so realistically I'll only have a bit more to worry about.

After my job's initial bonus and tax refunds this year, I have basically 15k 
of money on hand.  Unrelated to my question in the title but an extra 
consideration, I've thought about throwing about half of that money towards 
some of my bigger loans to lower my interest rates, which for me calculated to 
be around a total savings around $1000 in the long run.

But onto the credit card.  I had my current credit card info stolen (not sure 
how, possibly due to the heartbleed SSL bug?) I caught it yesterday morning 
from a $2 charge across the US, and unfortunately the guy also charged $70 
worth of gas before my credit company shut the card off.  Because of this, I'm 
kind of stuck on purchases since my current card provider says it will take 
about 8-10 business days to provide me a new card.  I don't want to have this 
issue again, AND I want to start increasing my credit, so I want to get an 
additional card to lower my total utilization and get some rewards.  My 
current card gives me no cash back or rewards.

For my current credit score, I'm not certain.  Pulling up my free reports 
today finally informed me I have a collector out for $70 for a ""closing"" bill 
from my old internet provider when I moved out of a house after college.  It
lists that as being reported in 7/2013, but I pulled reports at the end of 
7/2013 and got a report from 10/2013 though both did not mention this 
collection fee.  I have attempted to dispute this claim and hopefully that 
will go through as to not harm my credit over a small bill no one ever sent to 
me before tossing it up on my credit.

Credit karma (I believe incorrectly) said my score was 620.  Which is bad. 
However it does not show my proper credit card, my credit union switched from 
Visa to Mastercard a few years ago and I think it shows the Visa, as it says I 
have 0% utilization and that was reported in '08.  My report from 10/2013 said 
my BEACON 09 FACTA and BEACON 09 scores were 730 each.  Not sure how that 
compares to other reports but from what I looked at it's similar.

Cards I was looking at from recommendations were the Discover It card to get 
free credit reports monthly, plus additional benefits, or the Amazon card 
since I tend to buy from Amazon any time I buy something.

I also need to get new tires and brakes soon, so I don't know if having a big 
purchase in the future would change which card I would want due to some 
rewards.  I do not really want an annual fee with my card, but if someone who 
is more knowledgeable knows that its benefits would outweigh the negatives I 
would consider it.  And given that there was a negative report for the $70 
collection, should I wait until the dispute goes through prior to applying for 
a new card?  Or am I likely to be able to get one anyways?

This post is intended as a replacement, and incorporates general guidance found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq) and that given often by /r/personalfinance regulars.  I also address several common questions for each step.  

If you see something that isn't correct or have suggestions on other things to add, please let me know in the comments or by private message.

******

### Step 0: Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals

Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going.  Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses.  Online tools like [Mint.com](https://www.mint.com/) or Excel sheets like those found in the sidebar can help you track your expenses.  You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical - housing costs, utilities, and basic sustenance are harder to eliminate than ""entertainment,"" eating out, or clothing expenses.

Once your budget is figured out, you need to figure out what your goals are.  Secure retirement?  Buying a house?  Saving for a car?  We'll get to specifics on how to save for these a little later on.

### Step 1: Build an emergency fund

An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up.  [Unexpected travel](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1xru6s/this_is_why_you_have_an_emergency_fund/), [essential appliance replacement](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/15wa61/the_beauty_of_the_emergency_fund_it_makes_things/), and [sudden medical procedures](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ic7ft/friendly_reminder_emergency_fund/) are all user-submitted examples of emergency funds in action.  If you need to draw from your emergency fund at any time, your first priority as soon as you get back on your feet should be to replenish it.  Treat your emergency fund right and it will return the favor.

## How should I size my emergency fund?

Take a look at the sidebar link, ""[Why have an Emergency Fund?](http://www.wisebread.com/figuring-the-size-of-your-emergency-fund)"" for some general guidance.

## What kind of account should I hold my emergency fund in?

Opinions vary, but generally emergency funds should be held in safe investments you can liquidate in a hurry.  FDIC-insured savings or checking accounts, CDs, treasury bonds ([I-bonds](http://www.moneycrashers.com/series-i-savings-bonds/), in particular) are often recommended here.  Since the point of an emergency fund is to have a sum of money you can depend on, things that should *not* compose your emergency fund include stocks, credit cards, HELOCs, or anything else whose value can vary significantly or be taken away without warning (such as lines of credit).

### Step 2: Employer-sponsored matching funds

Once your emergency fund is set, the next step is to ensure you are contributing enough to your employer-sponsored retirement plan (if available) to get any matching funds from your employer (if they offer them).  The reason you do this before paying off high interest debt is that employer matching funds are risk-free, guaranteed returns on your investments at (usually) a higher rate than your debts.  

For example, if your employer offers 50% matching on the first 6% of your contributions to a 401k, you want to make sure you contribute 6% of your salary to take full advantage of the match.  Instant 50% return on investment is pretty good!  Be aware that 401k contributions must come from payroll deductions, so if you have a sum of money and want to take advantage of the match you need to increase your contribution percentage from your paycheck and use your lump sum for expenses.

## What if my employer doesn't match, or I don't have an employer-sponsored plan?

Move to step 3.

## What if my employer contributes to an account on my behalf regardless of whether I contribute or not?

You are very fortunate.  Move to step 3.

### Step 3: Pay down high interest debts

After you ensure you're taking advantage of your employer match, you should use your lump sum to pay down your high interest debt.  There are two main methods of paying down debt:

* In the **avalanche** method, debts are paid down in order of interest rate, starting with the debt that carries the highest interest rate.  This is the financially optimal method of paying down debt, and you will pay less money overall compared to the snowball method.

* The **snowball** method, popularized by Dave Ramsey, debts are paid down in order of balance size, starting with the smallest.  Paying off small debts first may give you a psychological boost and improve one's cash flow situation, as paid off debts free up minimum payments.  The downside is that larger loans (that may be at higher interest rates) are left untouched for longer, costing more in the long run.

In both cases you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before choosing which method to devote extra money to.  As an example, Debtor Dan has the following situation:

* Loan A: $1100 with a minimum payment of $100/month, 5% interest
* Loan B: $3300 with a minimum payment of $300/month, 10% interest
* Sudden windfall: $2000

Dan needs to first pay $100 + $300 = $400 to make the minimum payments on loans A and B so the payments are recorded as ""on time.""  The extra $1600 can either go towards Loan A (smallest balance, snowball method), eliminating it with $500 left to go towards Loan B, or Loan B entirely (highest interest rate, avalanche method).

What's the best method?  /r/personalfinance tends to default to the avalanche method, but do not underestimate the psychological side of debt payments.  If you think that the psychological boost from paying off a smaller debt sooner will help you stay the course, do it!  You can always switch things up later.  The important thing is to start paying your debts as soon as you can, and to keep paying them until they're gone.  You can use [unbury.us](http://unbury.us/) to help you get an idea of how long each method will take, and how much interest you'll be paying overall.

## Should I be in a hurry to pay off lower interest loans?  What rate is ""low"" enough to where I should just pay the minimum?

Depending on your attitude towards debt, you may want to stop paying off loans with low interest rates once you have paid all other loans above that threshold.  A common argument is that the long-term return from investments in the stock market will likely exceed the interest rate from a low-interest loan.  While this has been true in the past, keep in mind that paying down a loan is a guaranteed return at the loan's interest rate.  Stock performance is anything but guaranteed.  Fairly common consensus is that loans above 4% interest should be paid off in the debt reduction phase, while anything under that can be stretched out.

## Shouldn't I stretch out a loan to improve my credit score?

No.  Loans should never be stretched out longer than they need to be, as you should not pay a cent in interest more than you have to for the sake of improving one's credit score.  Interest rate should be the sole factor in whether or not you pay extra on a loan or not.

### Step 4: Additional savings for retirement in an IRA

A lot of questions in /r/personalfinance involve the various retirement accounts and how to save money in them.  Once your emergency fund is set and your high interest debt paid off, if you want to save more for retirement the next step is to maximize your IRA contribution for the current tax year.  For specifics on IRAs, see [Your IRA and You: Basic Information](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1rworh/your_ira_and_you_basic_information/).

## Why contribute to an IRA?  Shouldn't I go back to my 401k?

IRAs, since they are opened by individuals with a provider of your choice, are generally better than 401k plans because you have more fund choices.  Low cost providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer low expense ratio index funds to invest in.  However, if you have an excellent 401k plan such as the U.S. Federal government's Thrift Savings Plan or work for a large company that has negotiated institutional rates for the mutual funds in their 401k plan, you may want to do step 5a first and return to your IRA contribution afterwards.

### Step 5a: Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plan

After you've funded an IRA, if you still have money you want to put away for retirement then you should go back and round out your 401k contributions so you are contributing as much as your budget allows.  For specifics on 401ks, see [Your 401k and You: Basic Information](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1p1sj9/your_401k_and_you_basic_information/).  As in step 2, you can't make direct contributions to your 401k (they have to come from payroll deductions).  Adjust your contributions from your paycheck accordingly.

## My 401k plan is awful.  Should I still contribute to it?

Yes.  You should always take advantage of your tax-advantaged retirement accounts before saving for retirement in a taxable account.  The effect of high expenses really only starts to bite after long periods of time, and 401ks are quite portable in that you can roll them to your IRA if you leave your current employer, or sometimes you can roll it into a new 401k with a new employer. Bad 401k plans can turn into great IRAs in a heartbeat.

### Step 5b: Save for non-retirement goals

After your IRA contribution you may want to divert your discretionary income towards shorter-term goals than retirement.  Common examples include down payments for homes, vehicles, babies, and vacations.  The time frame for these goals will dictate what kind of account you save in.  For short term goals (usually &lt;5 years) you'll want to use an FDIC-insured savings account or short term CDs.  If your time horizon is longer, or you can afford to adjust your plans, you might consider something riskier like a mixed stock/bond fund or other mutual fund.  The best savings or investment vehicle will vary depending on time frame and risk tolerance.  Feel free to start a thread with the details of your situation and we will help you.

Also, I listed this as step ""5b"" but you could certainly prioritize non-retirement savings over retirement savings in an IRA (step 4).  Just keep in mind that (especially for a young person) the more time your money has to grow, the more powerful the effects of compounding will be on your retirement savings.

### Step 6: Save for retirement in a taxable account

*(If you decided to save for non-retirement goals instead of a 401k in step 5b, you should maximize contributions to your 401k before opening a taxable account.)*

If you maximize contributions to your IRA and 401k, but your lump sum still leaves you more money you want to spend in retirement, open a taxable brokerage account and invest according to your retirement asset allocation.  You'll want to have a decent grasp on [asset allocation in multiple accounts](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation_in_multiple_accounts) and [tax-efficient fund placement](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement).

A note about my 401k loan:
I know taking a loan out on your 401k is ill advised in PF.    

For one, I am now learning and applying the foundation of PF to my financials.  A couple of years ago, I took a risk and purchased a multi-family home rental property using an FHA loan to increase my monthly cash flow.  Out of college, I felt trapped in paying debt without any return (remember – I was not knowledgeable of PF, but I had loans) with an OK paying job.     

I decided, during my 20s, to only paid the minimum balances and save up for a down payment and initial upstart costs.  My gamble has resulted in in an additional $2k/mo cash flow, although I acquired additional debt with expensive repairs after tenants moved in.    

I decided to use a $401k loan to avoid any additional credit / financial trouble.  Bad news is that I acquired more debt.  Good news is that now I have more cash flow to manage my debt, which I’ve already paid off all my credit cards and car loan.  Now, I am focusing on my student loans.  After my student loans, I plan to buy more MFH homes. 

TL; DR:  I have a 401k and I don’t know how to allocate my funds.  I do not want to lose money with my rate of return.  Yes, I have a 401k loan and I know that is not a good thing to do.  What do you think I should from this point forward?",finance,1397240505

I called the credit card to take advantage of the offer, but when they asked what I was using it for, I told them, and the representative said that she ""could not process"" my request.

This is what she said:

&gt;""Unfortunately, if you're using it to pay back the Chase card, I can't process that.""

&gt;""Uh, I just mean you'd transfer it to my checking, and I'd pay it back later…""

&gt;""Yeah, I can't process that if you're stating that's the purpose.  But once it's in your account, it's up to you what to do with it.  You can just use a check.""

So, I want to know what you guys think.  I know that according to the new credit CARD act, payments must be applied to the balance with the ~~lowest~~ highest APR.

dogecoin,Poor Shibe is getting married...only one problem. (Not completely an x-post from /r/dogecoinbeg),"Hello shibes,

So here's the story:

I am a web and mobile app developer that is getting married in 5 weeks (yay!) to the love of my life, whom I met 10 years ago in High School.

Business was great, much projects, building apps that are so crypto!1, very UI/UX wow, etc.

Of course, as luck would have it, I got stiffed for $50,000 on a multi-platform mobile app with a OO-PHP web API backend/ admin interface, last week. I was counting on this client's signed, contractually-bound and approved invoice to pay for the wedding. I have been getting the oh so familiar ""check's in the mail"" for months, and now, no response from the client. poof Client equips +1000 sneak helm of douchebaggery.

Since the cash didn't come through, and the client completely ignored payment plan requests, and I have long since signed and placed down payments on all the wedding vendors (6 months ago), I've had to max out all of my credit cards just to pay vendors I contractually owe balances...no backing out now.

I applied for a lendingclub loan, got rejected (debt service ratio to high...surprise surprise) I applied for a PNC personal loan, got rejected (I rent instead of own, and again, debt service ratio to damn high) I applied for a Discover personal debt consolidation loan, and you guessed it, rejected again (see previous rejections for the common theme here)

And now my credit score is 75 points lower than it was before applying for all these loans :( Goodbye excellent credit rating...hello debt up to my eyeballs.

The client is an LLC that refuses to pay for any services rendered.
I talked to a couple lawyer buddies that basically said I am thoroughly boned and will most likely never see the cash from this project.

To make matters worse, the client's wife is a lawyer...so suing and wearing him down will not work, as I'll run out of money in lawyer fees long before the client (since his lawyer cost is $0)

---

Since I build web things... perhaps someone needs my services in trade?

I am open to doing whatever in order to make the wedding day a happy day, and not an ""oh shit...I can't sustain these credit card payments and by the way honey we are now bankrupt...thanks for marrying me!"" Such is life...

I need about 7k USD to solve all of the financial hardships... basically the cost of an entry-level web-api enabled Phonegap App.
That covers all the credit card debt I racked up last week.

The honeymoon will just have to wait until next year I suppose :(

Feel free to send me a PM for service trade requests for DOGE and the like...

If you made it this far, thanks for reading!

TL:DR Never do business with an LLC that doesn't put any cash down up front :/",cryptocurrency,1397254134

personalfinance,I've come to the realization that I need to cut back and change my spending habits. Here's my income and necessary expenses. What is realistic for me?,"Long story short: I've accumulated more debt than I am comfortable with on an entry level salary. My car died on my today and I would be less than surprised if it is in the neighborhood of $1000 if not more to be fixed. I must cut back before things get out of control. 

Income: $2,142/month directly into my bank account (after taxes and mandatory retirement contribution)

Savings: Account A- $2004 (I try not to touch this account) Account B- $280 (I use this account to pay for school every few months and contribute towards unexpected expenses)

Rent: $450/month

Utilities: $160/month

Insurance (Car + Renters): $104/month

Gas: $45 if I only fill up once, $90 if I fill up twice. Usually fill up twice about every 3rd month.

Necessary Groceries: $250/month

Credit Card A: Balance- $1200/$6000 limit, Interest Rate- 17%, Minimum Payment Monthly- $15+accumulated interest

Credit Card B: Balance- $900/$5000 limit, Interest Rate- 12%, Minimum Payment Monthly- $25

Student Loan A (Federal): $29,000, Interest Rate- 6.625% fixed, Minimum Payment Monthly- In Deferment but I pay $175/month anyway to keep up with interest and pay a little principal. About $22,000 is unsubsidized so it still accumulates interest in deferment. 

Student Loan B (Private): $26,700, Interest Rate- 2.7% variable, Minimum Payment- $160/month

Student Loan C (Private): $6,000, Interest Rate- 4.3% variable, Minimum Payment- $52/month

Grad School: Between $600 and $840 every 4 months. I work full-time at the school I am attending so they pay for most of it, but it's still a significant expense. Usually about half comes from savings B, and half goes on credit card B. 

Savings Contributions: $75/month to Account A, $40/month to account B

What would be a reasonable amount to put towards each of my debts at the beginning of each month, and still have enough left over for groceries, food, and maybe 1 or 2 frugal nights out or a six pack here and there etc? What debts should be my priority? I get paid in full at the beginning of the month so it tends to go very quickly. I have been paying down my credit card debt little by little without drastic changes for the past few months, but my car dying is pushing the issue over the top.

Bitcoin,Someone please explain why any government won't regulate the snot out of Bitcoin?,"Someone explain to me why the federal government will let Bitcoin stay anonymous?

This argument that it's less anonymous than cash is laughable. You can't send cash across the Internet to someone you have never met in a country you can't pronounce.

Yes, you can analyze the blockchain for the intersection of a known person's address with a criminal, but it won't help if the identified person has no relationship or means of finding the criminal.

Cash is anonymous too - but it's so easy to make a mistake that can lead authorities to your doorstep. Intelligent criminals do stupid things, say stupid things, get caught for trusting someone they shouldn't. The streets are not anonymous - at all.

I can't imagine why any government would let go of money laundering and know-your-customer controls by permitting Bitcoin to operate in its current form. I am sure they will eventually ban exchanges that do not link a person's confirmed identity to their Bitcoin address(es). If Bitcoin even gets that far.

I am not trying to argue for the status quo. I agree with many of the principles that people discuss regarding Bitcoin and it's promise.

I don't agree that the genie is already out of the bottle. There are dozens of ways the lights can be turned off here. I want this thing to flourish. How though?",cryptocurrency,1397275100

dogecoin,"[Long, serious] What next from Dogecoin, 12 April 2014","There’s been a lot of discussion in recent days about the decreasing price of Dogecoin, as well as the risk of a 51% attack from Wafflepool or similar. I wanted to do a wrap-up of the discussions happening amongst the developers of the last few weeks, partly to illustrate that we are looking at options, but mostly to talk about what is happening. Please note that this is all rapidly changing. Dogecoin is actually moving at breakneck speed for a project of its size, especially as we still have a relatively limited core team. This is part of why we don’t write posts very often, as they become out of date so quickly as new arguments and facts are presented.

Lets talk about 51% attacks first. The theory is that if anyone has over 51% of the total hashing power of the network, they can form a blockchain of their own which is considered “more valid” than the blockchain most users are on. This is because cryptocurrency blockchains are secured through proof of work, and therefore more work on a chain makes it, in essence, more valid. This risks an attacker spending coins on one chain, then releasing their own private, longer, blockchain. That latter blockchain replaces the original blockchain, and the coins they spent on the original blockchain are effectively returned to them as if the transactions never happened.

It’s important to understand this because I hear suggestions that Wafflepool shouldn’t accept over 51% of the network hashrate, and unfortunately all this would do is hide the risk. Having one pool own over 51% of the network hashrate is not a problem if it’s actually being used to mine, but instead if it’s used to create a personal blockchain.

The other issue raised is one of price; we’ve been steadily dropping since around early February. The core of my answers here is that you need to consider demand vs supply. What happened back in February was that we saw a surge in demand beyond sustainable levels, likely in a form of tulip mania. As supply continued (mining), and demand dropped-off, our price has dropped. This has been worsened by a succession of bad news affecting Bitcoin (MtGox and other exchanges struggling, uncertainty of China and Russia, etc.), which both directly brings down our price, as well as undermining confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It has been suggested (and I can believe this, but have not done my own analysis) that as multipools continue to dominate Dogecoin mining, and they tend to sell coins directly, that they are further reducing the price. Specifically, given that while there is demand for further coins from miners, as they have already expended resources on mining hardware they cannot then purchase the cheap coins the mining pools are producing.

Lastly, there’s the question of ASICs; these are specialised mining devices which are significantly faster than CPU/GPU mining hardware, and typically cheaper to run due to reduced power and space requirements. Their introduction into mining at the moment leaves vastly disproportionate mining power in the hands of a few (there’s one individual with a hashrate of around 20GH/s, for example), and in time is likely to make mining on commodity hardware infeasible.

We’ve had a lot of suggestions for what to do; change proof of work algorithm, add multiple proof of work algorithms, move to proof of stake, merge-mine with Litecoin, have DigiShield merge-mine with us. We’ve considered everything, and then some; I’m not sure how much discussion has happened in total, but I’ve spent over a dozen hours looking at these issues on IRC. In virtually all cases, the majority of people with the skills to implement these changes have rejected them as too high risk and/or having other significant drawbacks.  In summary:

* Changing proof of work introduces a number of risks; potential for a bug in the change to cause serious consequences (see recent issues with Blackcoin and CleanWaterCoin for examples), that we don’t manage to get a majority updated before fork and end up effectively 51% attacking our own blockchain (not to mention that at least one exchange frequently misses these updates and causes problems as a result), that the algorithm itself has problems (see the long term issues of multipools managing to exploit “random” block rewards), or we simply lose users/merchants who are fed up constantly updating software.
* As a less technical concern; personally I’m uncomfortable knowingly make changes which intentionally introduce unneeded inefficiencies, which mean consumption of vastly more resources (electricity, and by proxy fossil/nuclear fuels). I imagine I’ll be swamped by shibes running geothermal mining facilities at the end of this post…
* Changing to proof of stake (and this is particularly relevant in context of my previous comment) is interesting, however right now I don’t feel I personally know enough to make a judgement on how to make the jump safely and efficiently. Statistician/economist shibes, I’d love to hear more from you.
* While I don’t like the idea of changing proof of work, I’m also pragmatic about these things; I am trying to find time to read up on Myriadcoin‘s multiple-PoW support, and in particular considering whether it could be hooked into the code without necessarily enabling it right now, as a harness for potential future changes.
* Merged mining with Litecoin (and thanks to Charlie Lee for the invitation, of course) would likely help us mitigate 51% attack risks, by merging our mining power together, however it would introduce what have so far been considered undue issues for our mining community. Specifically, merged mining would require significant changes to mining infrastructure, adopting either p2pool or a mining proxy. Many have raised concerns that LTC miners would simply dump DOGE; personally I believe we could have an LTC/DOGE swap doing in the p2pool layer to give each miner whichever coin they prefer, to mitigate this, so this is not a risk I consider a major issue. There are also concerns that we would always be the secondary coin to LTC; personally I’d have considered a pre-defined block at which we de-merge a requirement, but again this isn’t a route we’re taking, I am just going through the evaluation I have done for reference.
* Having smaller coins merge with us is interesting, however given our size in proportion to those coins, and that they are likely to be reluctant to merge with us (as we are reluctant to merge with Litecoin), I’m not expecting to see much progress in this area. We have made the invitation to DigiByte however.

The best suggestion we have so far is to out-do the multipools directly, by working on open source multipool software which is more DOGE-friendly. As I understand it two key approaches are being considered for improving DOGE-friendliness; either by directly exchanging other coins to DOGE, or through improved trading algorithms which result in less sharp shocks to the price. For very large mining farms such as SFire’s, it’s hoped this will cause them to separate from the mining pools (which they pay fees to) and go solo. This reduces fees for the miner, as well as reducing the ability for DDoS attacks to be targeted at them, and for us it reduces risk of a 51% attack, improves confidence in the coin security, and enables us to better mitigate impact of people mining huge quantities to sell.

Meanwhile, the main focus is on making Dogecoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) a viable way of moving value around. The 1.7 client (beta release is imminent, and in fact if you’re comfortable compiling it yourself, the code is available from https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/tree/v1.7.0-Beta-1 ) is a major re-write of Dogecoin Core to base it on the Bitcoin Core 0.9 client (with Scrypt added in, of course). This gives us significant performance improvements, as well as a better underlying architecture. To repeat; this will not be a required update, although it will be strongly encouraged as it’s a huge leap forward technologically. One of the features which is currently not working in 1.7, but will be for release, is the Bitcoin payment protocol, which massively improves the payment request/receiving process for merchants. Fundamentally 1.7 is intended to prove we have the technical skills to maintain a stable, useful coin, and help drive/support adoption.

Once 1.7 is done, my immediate priority is technical documentation; we have a security specialist currently working on a guide to cryptocurrency security (setup, risks, best practices, etc.), to help give merchants and exchanges an in-depth understanding of how to securely use cryptocurrency. I’ll be addressing the need for formal standards in Dogecoin, and preparing RFCs for the “dogecoin:” URI and relay network protocol for submission to the IETF (and IANA for the URI).

Lastly; there was a post recently about the need for multi-signature addresses; I’d like to add my own “hell yes!” to that, although obviously I have to prioritise. If anyone else can look at these, that would be fantastic.

##What is the FDCPA/FCRA, and how does it pertain to me?

In a nutshell:

It was decided, some time ago, about when CCs were available to the masses, that creditors collecting on debts could not burden a debtor for life. Thus the 7.5 year reporting time, and the statute of limitations were implemented. Basically stated, creditors had a set limited amount of time to report and collect on legally owed debts. Anything past that time was forever lost to them. It was also decided that to protect debtors/consumers, a set of rules and regulations were needed to protect them and to control what could and couldn’t be reported on their credit reports. This came to be called the Fair Credit Reporting Act or [FCRA]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act), and was implemented in October 1970. It was also decided that collection agencies had to follow a set of rules and regulations when attempting to collect. This was called the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or [FDCPA]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Debt_Collection_Practices_Act) This generally applies to third party debt collectors, and not original creditors. However some states have similar consumer protection laws that mirror the FDCPA. The FDCPA covers debts by consumers, and not businesses. Every time a debtor uses credit from a lender, both debtor and the lender are subject to the rules and laws of the FDCPA and FCRA.

##How to deal with Collection Agencies

A lot of people think that if they just talk to a CA, they can straighten things out, make the debt go away, or come to an “agreement” with them. This is far from the truth! Remember, the CAs have one goal in mind; to get as much money from you as they can. It doesn’t matter to them how they do this, and in cases of unscrupulous CAs, it doesn’t matter what they say to achieve their goal. CAs are NOT your friend! They do not care about your hardships, or that your spouse was in an accident and was the sole earner. They do not care that you got sick and missed two pay checks and thus fell behind on bills. They want the money. That being said, that doesn’t mean all CAs are cold heartless bastards, just that at the end of the day, they want you to pay. Is some cases, as in assigned debt, the faster they collect from you the higher their cut of the bacon is! Typically though, they’ve paid pennies on the dollar but will still want ALL of the debt owed.

This is merely a guideline, and everyone has a unique situation. However, there are a few basic points that are common for everyone. ALL written communication should be sent CRR!

Additionally, I ALWAYS recommend sending WRITTEN dispute letters, versus online dispute letters via the CRAs website. The CRAs have become behemoths which tend to “lose” vital information. Sending a written dispute letter, and keeping a copy for yourself provides not only the written request, but also the date the letter was accepted, thus not only creating a paper trail, but also starting the time period to which a CRA must abide by.

**Dealing with Collection Agencies**

* KNOW YOUR RIGHTS! This is where looking up the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act(FDCPA) helps you. It prevents the CA from using abusive, unfair, or deceptive methods to collect from you. It also provides the guidelines for when and how they can contact you. They cannot contact you before 8 AM, or after 9PM unless you agree to it. They also cannot contact you at work once you have informed them via writing, or orally, that you are not allowed to get calls there. You can also request the CA from contacting you via phone and only via written communication. You simply get their address, send them a letter sent CRR, and specifically tell them to only communicate via writing. Keep a copy of the letter for future reference, as well as the number the USPS uses to track the letter. DO NO SIGN THE LETTER! Again, DO NOT SIGN THE LETTER! CAs are tricky, it’s not unheard of them to transpose your signature to documentation they currently have, to be used against you.

* Know your telephone recording laws! ALWAYS ALWAYS record the conversation when you can! In my state, only 1 person needs to know that the telephone conversation is being recorded, in that case, it would be me! This is to make sure the CAs are playing by the rules, and are NOT violating YOUR rights. If they do, YOU can pursue THEM for damages. You can buy cheap recording apps on your phones, both apple and droid. The small initial investment may payoff big time in the long run!

* Your FIRST response when picking up the phone from a CA is to say: “This is John Doe, this conversation is currently being recorded as allowed per X state laws.” Again, verify the recording laws per your state before making the statement!  This does two things: It informs the CA that they are being recorded, and they usually tone down, AND it becomes evidence that can be used in a court of law. If you cannot record, due to state laws, or you just don’t have the ability to do so, keep a log! Write down the time, the date, and what was said. Write down what they requested, what you responded, etc.. This can be used as evidence too!

* Let them talk. Let them go thru their spiel. Write down everything, if you aren’t recording, for future reference , and to check against your records. It could be they have the wrong John Doe! 

* Request their mailing address. Repeat it back to them. If you don’t want them to contact you again via phone, inform them. Be very clear about it. Repeat it in the certified letter you send to them. Also, inform them to not contact you at your work too. Repeat it in the certified letter too! Once they have been informed they cannot contact you at your place of business OR your personal number, they can contact you once more, but only to inform you that they won’t contact you again, OR to inform you they are pursuing legal action against you. Any other contact contact via phone is a violation!

* Request they send all information requests via mail. This is IMPORTANT! You are requesting they send ALL the information about the delinquent account to you in writing. This is important because you will have the documentation in your hands and can look at each piece versus trying to remember it in your head, is the CA correct, do I really owe this, etc.. It also prevents you from saying something that can hurt you legally. Admitting you owe the debt(even if you’re not sure), agreeing to make a payment, or inferring that you can make a payment. All these things hurt you.

* Your reply at this point should be “This is not an admission of owing the debt, but I need the information regarding said debt to verify whether or not it is indeed mine. Please send me a validation notice. Please send the information to …..”  A validation notice is just that, it notifies you of the amount of the debt owed, the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed, and directions on how to proceed if you think you don’t owe the debt. This validation notice MUST BE SENT to you within 5 days of the initial phone call. Failure to send it is a violation, and if you’ve recorded the call, you can use that with the delay in sending you the letter, in court!

* If at any point the CA becomes aggressive, rude, or keeps repeating the question of when you can make a payment, just hang up. Simple as that. Hang up.  If by this point you have NOT requested they quit calling you, make sure you inform them the next time they call. Believe me, they will call again! Even if you have to talk over them, keep repeating yourself. Rule of thumb is to repeat it 4 times, or until they hang up. Again, if you are recording the call, this can be used as evidence.

* Once you receive the validation notice. EVEN IF YOU KNOW you owe the debt, send a debt validation letter within 30 days of receiving the CAs validation notice! If you think the debt is in error, send them a letter stating  the debt is not yours, to which they must stop contact with you.
*Be prepared to go the distance! This is your credit score we’re talking about! Any incorrect information can have a detrimental effect on your score to which interest rates, housing, employment, and future lending options depend on! You will be paying thousands of extra dollars due to bad information on your report.

The reason you send a debt validation letter, even if you know you owe the debt, is because the CAs, by law, MUST PROVE  you owe the debt. They expect you to play by and follow the rules/laws in regards to debts owed. So should you expect them to play and follow the rules/laws in collecting a debt. One of those laws is that they MUST PROVE the debt is yours. Failure to provide these important details means the CAs aren’t legally entitled to collect  said debt!

* How do you know the CA is legally allowed to collect said debt for the OC?

* Is the amount shown the actual amount owed? Has there been any interest or other charges added? Are the interest and the other charges added legal?

* Where is the original contract stating the details of the terms of the debt?

All questions the CA must answer!

##Verifying a Debt

It is your lawful right to request the CA verify a debt they are trying to collect on. Once you have requested a debt verification, by law, the CA MUST STOP collection attempts. IF they continue to do so, the debtor can sue the CA. A debtor can dispute all, or a portion of said debt, and it all begins with a collection notice.


Once a collection notice has been received, the debtor has 30 days to respond. Failure to respond verifies said debt automatically. If a notice to verify said debt is sent within 30 days of the initial collection attempt, than the CA must stop collection attempts UNTIL the required information verifying the debt is provided.


*There is NO time period to when a CA has to verify the debt!* Again, there is NO time period to when a CA has to verify the debt. They could take a week, a month, a year, etc., but during that time period collections must cease!


The FIRST step a CA has to take when attempting to collect on a debt is to verify that you indeed do owe said debt(s). Unfortunately, there are only two things that a CA needs to provide:


* The name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed to.


* The amount of the debt owed.

That's it! There are some serious discussions related to how little is required to verify the debt.


One should ALWAYS request a CA to verify the debt, as well as request the address to the OC to whom the debt is owed to.


Again, ALL communications should be in WRITING, sent CRR via the USPS.


Basic rules are to ALWAYS have a CA verify a debt. However, there are certain instances when verifying a debt could cause more damage than intended. For instance, it makes NO sense to request a verification on a debt that is at or near the SOL or that is at or near the reporting clock. Doing so only heightens the chance that a CA takes legal action while they still can.


##Common Myths
There are literally hundreds of myths involving credit reports, scores, and collection agencies. Here are some of the most common myths I’ve run across:

**If I don’t pay the debt(s), I will go to jail**

Ok, maybe if we lived over 100 years ago! This is one of the most ridiculous myths out there by far, and the worst thing about this myth? CAs use this as a terror tactic to get debtors to pay. THERE IS NO DEBTORS JAIL! Got that? Again, THERE IS NO DEBTORS JAIL! Now, you will hear about people in the news who have gone to jail stemming from debts owed, but if you look at the case closely, it’s not that they didn’t pay their debts that landed them in jail, it’s that they defied a judge’s order to pay said debts. There is a BIG difference there!

**The person I talked to said they were a lawyer and therefore wasn’t governed by the FDCPA/FCRA**

No wonder lawyers get a bad rap, they make it themselves! This is FALSE. The FDCPA states that ANY person/lawyer or firm that is hired to collect on a debt, is considered a debt collector and thus falls under the rules of the FDCPA.

**Talking to a collection agency resets the statute of limitations/collection clock**

 This is incorrect. Simply talking to them does NOT reset the SOL/collection clock. However it’s what you SAY that can make a difference. If you make a partial payment, verify the debt as yours, or infer that you CAN make a partial/full payment, THAT resets the SOL/collection clock.

**The creditor charged-off the amount owed, so now I don’t owe the debt!**

A charge-off doesn’t mean the debt isn’t owed, or that it goes away, it just simply means the creditor has given up on collecting.  The debt is STILL OWED, it’s just not being collected on. Any CA can purchase the debt and attempt collections. An additional ramification to this is that you may get a 1099 from the OC for the amount charged off. The IRS deems this as income, so you may owe taxes on it! I’m not entirely sure how they claim it’s income, you should consult with /r/legaladvice, as well as a tax professional.

**I have a debt incurred in another state across the country. Recently I received a call from a CA, in the current state I’m in, regarding the debt I owe in the other state. They said the SOL regarding the debt “travels” with the debtor, thus I have to go by the SOL in the state I currently reside in**

This is a common ruse used by CAs. They know the majority of debtors don’t know the rules and their rights afforded them. This is false. The SOL on a debt is taken from the state the debt was incurred in. If you have a debt in OR, and moved to TX, where TX has a longer SOL on certain debts, the SOL doesn’t “travel”/”update” to the state you reside in, but stays with the state the debt was incurred in. In other words, the debts SOL is from OR.

**If I pay a debt owed in collections, it will be removed from my credit report**

Paying a debt owed on your CR does NOT remove the negative mark. It stays on there! The only thing that will change is that the debt will be updated to say “paid in full” or something similar. The DOLA will also change to the date you paid the debt. 

**If I pay a debt owed in collections, my credit score will increase**

Again, no. A paid debt in collections is no better than a debt owed simply because the damage is already done by the negative item showing on your report. The ONLY way to increase your score is to remove the negative item by doing a “pay for delete”. However if you’re going to be making a large purchase, like a house, the lending institution/bank may want to see the debt paid before they will lend monies. Thus a paid debt on your report would be beneficial. Again, the DOLA would be updated, BUT your score would not increase.

**When I applied for credit, the bank said I had a zero(0) credit score, and therefore was denied**

This is impossible. You either have a credit score or you don’t have a credit score. If you don’t have a credit score, it’s because there isn’t enough information in your credit file to determine a score. However, lending institutions may have their OWN method of calculating a credit score, or they rely on another credit scoring system(other than FICO) to generate a number for you.

**It’s been 10 years since I’ve last heard from a collection agency on a debt. Today I get a call from a different collection agency saying I owe the debt**

If the the debt is past the SOL, it cannot be legally collected. The CA has run out of time to collect! However they will act as if you still owe the debt. You will need to provide evidence of the DOFD to prove the debt is past the SOL and therefore off limits. Once proof has been given, it is illegal to pursue collections. If the CA attempt to collect once provided proof it’s past the SOL, the debtor can sue the CA!

**If I pay a debt owed in collections, and it has been removed from my report, I will never see/hear about the debt again**

This is one of the most contentious myths out there that confuses a lot of people. Sure, in a perfect world, you paid a debt and it SHOULD NOT come back on your report. However a month, two months, a year or maybe even longer, you get your report and there is that damn debt again! How can this be? You paid the debt, but it’s still there! The problem is that there is NO database that CAs keep or follow that shows which debts are paid and which debts are owed. So your debt can literally be sold over and over and over, which means it will show it’s ugly face again and again and again on your report. It is than up to YOU, as the debtor, to provide the necessary documentation that the debt was paid, or that it is past the SOL. The good news is that if you can prove the debt has been paid, or past the SOL, the negative item can be quickly removed.

**I missed a payment than brought my account current for several months, than missed another payment and have not made a payment since. What is the date of first delinquency, the first time I missed a payment, or the last time a payment was made?**

The DOFD is the last time a payment was made and the account was never brought current. So if you missed Jan 1 payment, that would be the DOFD. However, if you brought the account current  Feb1 and made several on-time payments but missed the May 1 payment and never made another payment, May 1 would be the new DOFD.

**I have to pay to get my credit reports from all three bureaus.**

Each person gets one annual report from the bureaus per year. You do not have to pay for this. Go to annualcreditreport.com to get yours. This is a GENERIC report that does NOT give a FICO score.

**I’ve disputed an error on my report and have proved the information is wrong, yet the CRA hasn’t removed the negative item. Oh well, I guess it will stay there**

Part of the FCRA is that you have a legal right to dispute incorrect information on your reports, and if the information contained in it is incorrect, you have the right to request it be removed. The FCRA also states that the CRAs are required to fix any incorrect information or face legal action. In many cases, the CRAs are understaffed and move like molasses. Hiring a lawyer may be the best option, plus if you can prove you suffered damages, you can sue.

**I requested a ‘pay for delete’ from a CA and they refused, insisting I pay the full amount. Aren’t they legally required to accept a ‘pay for delete’?**

No. A pay for delete is an option a debtor has, however the CAs are NOT REQUIRED to accept it. In fact, they may not be allowed to accept it if the debt they are collecting on is assigned debt and the OC wants the full amount. More on that in the “Pay for Delete” heading below.

**I received a call from a CA for an amount owed to the OC, but they’re adding “X” amount to the original debt as interest and fees, can they do this?**

Typically, NO. Not unless your original contract with the OC allows for this, or your state law allows for this. Otherwise, they cannot add on any interest, fees, or other charges.

Again, there are a lot of myths out there that confuse and mislead people. I urge everyone to educate themselves on their rights! 


##Pay for Delete
I see a lot of “just do a pay for delete” responses from people giving advice on how people should remove negative items from their reports. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as it sounds. Additionally, it’s difficult to do a pay for delete because the CRAs are extremely resistant to them. By law, CRAs are required to show accurate information on credit reports. Removing a debt, after it’s been verified, is removing accurate information from a report. In fact, I’ve heard(not confirmed) of a few instances where the CRAs have revoked the reporting privileges of CAs because they removed negative items. This is a HUGE consequence to a CA as it removes their #1 leverage point against a debtor; the debtors credit score!  If a CA can’t report to the CRAs, they might as well close shop and get into another line of business. This doesn’t mean a CA won’t do it, just that they may be extremely reluctant to do it.
However, if  a debtor CAN do a pay for delete, it is the BEST method of cleaning and improving their score as it not only removes the negative mark, but it also improves the score because the negative mark is gone. As with all debts, it is VERY important a debtor keep ALL paperwork and documentation regarding said paid debt for future reference!
One tactic recently used(after a pay for delete letter or other similar agreement) has the debtor send a debt validation letter to the CA, followed 30 days later by contacting the CRAs informing them that the CAs failed to verify said debt. The CRAs at that point have no choice but to remove the negative item due to the CAs failure to validate.

##You’ve been served papers!
DON’T PANIC!
You MUST answer the lawsuit! Failure to do so (failure to show) results in an automatic default judgement against you! This judgement wrecks your score and it can literally take years for it to go away. See “Judgement” in the terms listed below for additional information. I would highly suggest you retain the services of a competent lawyer at this point.
Typically one gets sued over a very high amount debt, and as a last resort when the SOL is nearing on said debt. I liken it to the “Hail Mary” play in football. The CAs know that time is running out and there’s just enough time left to get one last play in. What is the “Hail Mary”? It’s a trick play. Just like it is in football, so it is in collecting. I typically find that the CAs DON’T have the required documentation to prove the debt belongs to the debtor. So much so that before entering the court room, the CAs attempt to get the debtor to pay something to “avoid the unpleasantries of a court battle.” However when asked for proof of the original contract, or to provide the debtors signature, etc. they’re all thumbs! It’s their last scare tactic.

##In Summary
It’s a lot to process, but remember, this is your credit report you’re dealing with, and anything negative listed can/will affect your job, housing, banking, loans, education, and general overall health. Having a correct report is vital! Again, this is a viable tool afforded to you in dealing with debts, whether you think it’s moral or not. Know your rights! Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourselves, and don’t be afraid to go toe-to-toe with a CA. You’ll be pleasantly surprised that more than likely, you will win!

##Most commonly used Terms
Here are a number of the most commonly used terms, their abbreviations(if there is one), and their meanings in alphabetical order. I won’t go over all the terms used, just the important ones for this presentation. Please take the time to go over these as the following examples (further on down) will be used with these abbreviations. Please note that I don’t go into a lot of details for some of these but just enough for you to understand what they mean.

**Assigned Debt** No abbreviation. This is the most typical kind of medical debt, and usually the easiest to negotiate a settlement offer. Not 100% sure as to why it’s so easy to settle, I think it’s because the hospitals just want to get anything they can. This is when a creditor “gives” or “assigns” the debt to a collection agency for them to collect. The collection agency gets a percentage of the amount collected or a set amount, by the creditor upon a successful collection. Collection Agencies take their cues from the original creditors, if the original creditor won’t allow a settlement offer less than 100% of the amount owed, the collection agency can’t offer or accept anything other than 100% of the amount owed. Simple as that.

**Purchased Debt** No abbreviation. I placed this here so that it wouldn’t get lost in the shuffle. This is the most common type of junk debt that collection agencies purchase. It can be literally any type of debt that a collection agency purchases to attempt collections on. Typically credit cards, etc..

**Bankruptcy(BK)** The legal proceedings to discharge your debts owed under the various chapters 7/13 (or Chapter 20 as some call it when people do a 7 followed by a 13 a bit after). A bankruptcy stays on your credit report for UP TO 10 years before it will fall off.  Chapter 7 is a “clean slate” where almost all your debts are forgiven. Chapter 13 is a payment plan program where you make a set amount of payments for a set amount of years. Failure to abide by the payments and payment dates can toss the proceedings as well as any fraudulent activities. It is wise to keep your discharge letter for life, as you will more than likely need it to prove to a collection agency that a debt was discharged!

**Charge-Off** No abbreviation. This is the accounting term a creditor uses when they have decided to move your debt owed off of their books to the “bad debt” ledger. You will most likely get a 1099-C form listing the debt owed as income from the IRS. Why, because the IRS deems the forgiven amount as income! Who knows how they come to that conclusion. This can create a headache when April rolls around, so keep it in mind! Another important thing to remember is that a charge-off does NOT mean the debt is forgiven, or that it disappears! It just means the creditor has decided it is no longer worth their effort to collect and is then sold to collection agencies as junk debt.

**Collection Agency(CA)** These are firms that specialize in buying junk debt, and pursue collection activities against debtors. Some follow the rules in collecting, but the majority do what they can to collect.

**Credit Card(CC)** As is.

**Collection Clock** No abbreviation. This is in reference to the amount of time a debt can be collected on, tied with the statute of limitations listed below. This term is interchangeable with the statute of limitations term because each state is different in regards to the amount of time allocated for various debts. I would suggest researching what the times are for your state. This also is tied with collection agencies as depending on what you say to them, it can reset the collection clock/statute of limitations on said debts owed. More on that in the examples to follow. Also tied to the Date of Last Activity.

**Credit Reporting Agency(CRA)** These are in reference to the big 3 reporting agencies: Equifax(EQ), TransUnion(TU) and Experian(EX;) that list, and report your credit history. It is VERY important to make sure your reports are accurate!

**Creditor** No abbreviation. This is the bank/lending institution(or a personal acquaintance in bankruptcy proceedings) that a debt is owed to.

**Credit Report** Just as it states, given by the big three credit reporting agencies.

**Certified, Return Receipt requested(CRRR/CRR)** Actually two terms in one. Certified Mail, and Return Receipt requested. This involves delivering mail through the USPS. This is very important when communicating with collection agencies and the credit reporting agencies, as letters sent CRRR are physical proof of your attempt to contact/deliver correspondence and they are literally impossible to refute. 

**Date of First Delinquency(DOFD/DFD)** Just as it states, the date the credit line was **FIRST** delinquent. This is often confused with the Date of Last Activity(DOLA) but it is VERY important to be able to differentiate between the two. This affects the date to which the negative credit line will remain and eventually fall off your report. IT CANNOT BE CHANGED, except if a judgement has been issued against you! Many collections agencies try to change this as it affects how they can collect on delinquent accounts, but it is ILLEGAL and is known as re-aging. More on that below. They way the y calculate the DOFD is from the date the account is never brought current. For example, if you missed a month, that would become the DOFD, but if you brought the account current the following month and made several on time payments, and missed another month after that. that new month you missed would become the new DOFD. Debts fall off your report 7.5 years from the DOFD.

**Date of Default(DD)**The date the original account became 180 days past due. Debts fall off your report 7 years from the DD. 

**Date of Last Activity(DOLA)** Again, just as it states. This refers to the date that any activity, whether it be a partial payment, full payment, etc. or debt validation was made on the credit line.  As with the DOFD, collection agencies use this as a way of collecting, and it affects their collecting practices. This is tied with the statute of limitations/collection clock. This CAN be changed, but it DOES NOT change the date to which a negative credit line will fall off a credit report.

**Debt Validation(DV)** The process by which a collection agency MUST, BY LAW, validate the debt they are attempting to collect on. More on this below.

**Debtor** No abbreviation. This is the individual(for this purpose) that owes a debt to a creditor.

**Fair Credit Reporting Act(FCRA** In a nutshell, the law/act that controls the behavior of credit reporting agencies(CRAs) and specifically outlines what they can and cannot do, plus your rights. Here is a good [LINK]( http://www.bills.com/fcra/) 

**Fair Debt Collection Practices Act(FDCPA)**  This outlines what collection agencies CAN &amp; CANNOT do to collect on a debt. This is VERY IMPORTANT and I urge everyone to read up on their rights. In a nutshell it determines WHO they can contact about a debt owed, WHAT they can and cannot say, WHEN you can be contacted, and HOW you can be contacted. Keep in mind that violations can lead to legal claims against the collection agencies. 
**Fair, Issac &amp; Company(FICO)** Started by a mathematician and engineer in 1956, they provide analytic and decision making services, primarily credit scores, for financial lending institutions. In a nutshell, they guesstimate how much of a credit risk you are based on past credit/lending practices. Scores range from 300-850. One either HAS a credit score within the range, or THEY DON’T have a credit score. One CANNOT have a ZERO(0) credit score. If a lending institution states you have a zero credit score, they are using their own, or someone other than FICOs credit scoring system. 

**Judgement** No abbreviation. This is closely tied to the statute of limitations, the collection clock, and the various forms of bankruptcy. When a judgement is issued against a debtor, it means a judge has listened to both parties(collection agency &amp; debtor) and found the debtor liable for the amount asked for by the collection agency. The original debt amount may include attorneys fees, interest, filing fees, etc, anything related to suing the debtor. This AUTOMATICALLY resets the Date of First Delinquency to the date the judgement was issued, and is the ONLY thing that can change the DOFD. The new reporting time is now 7 years from the date the judgement was issued. Judgements stays ”active” for 10 years, and in some states 20 years. This means a collection agency has 10 years to garnish your wages, put liens on your property, seize bank accounts, etc. to collect the judgement owed. If they fail to do so within those ten years, most states allow a judgement to reset for another 10 years, and they allow the collection agency to continue resetting the clock indefinitely, thus literally making the debt never go away. If a judgement reaches the 10 year limit, IT DOES NOT GO AWAY, it becomes dormant. The good news is that while the judgement is dormant, it cannot be collected upon! The collection agency has to file to re-activate the judgement before they can attempt to collect on it. However any collection attempts on a dormant judgement can lead to monetary fines against the collection agency. If a person is ever summoned to appear in court, DO NOT IGNORE THE SUMMONS! This is the single most important thing you need to make sure you don’t miss! Failure to answer a summons means an automatic default judgement against you!

**Junk Debt Buyer(JDB) Or JD for Junk Debt**  These are ALL the charged-off accounts that creditors deem unworthy to collect that are bunched together and sold for pennies on the dollar to whichever collection agency will buy them. The collection agency will then turn around and attempt to collect from the debtors, often for the full amount or a settled amount.

**Original Creditor(OC) ** The creditor to whom the original debt is owed to. This is VERY IMPORTANT when dealing with collection agencies.

**Pay for Delete** The process where you pay an agreed upon amount with the original creditor OR a collection agency, and in return they remove the negative mark from your credit report. Note that collection agencies are NOT legally required to accept these, an in cases of assigned debt, they may not be allowed to.

**Re-Aging** There is no abbreviation for this, at least not that I can find. This is the process where the collection agency lists an old debt, past the collection reporting period, with a newer date on your credit report in order to try and collect on said debt. THIS IS ILLEGAL, and CANNOT be done. The collection agency can be fined if they continue to report the debt after they’ve been informed its past the reporting clock.

**Reporting Clock** No abbreviation. This is in reference to how long a delinquent debt can stay on your credit report, and IT CANNOT BE CHANGED unless there is a judgement against a debtor for the amount owed. The amount of time is seven years from the DATE OF FIRST DELINEQUENCY(DOFD). This is VERY important as MANY collection agencies will list the DOFD as the date THEY BOUGHT the debt. To counter this, it is upon the debtor to contact the original creditor to verify what the DOFD is and then to challenge the incorrect date with the CRAs.

**Settlement** No abbreviation, and for this purpose only. The monetary agreement that a debtor and a collection agency arrive at, to satisfy a debt. This could be for the full price, half price or a fraction of the full amount. ALWAYS GET SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS IN WRITING BEFORE PAYING!!!

**Statute of Limitations(SOL)** Or as I like to say Shit out of Luck! This is the amount of time set by a state(for this purpose) that determines the amount of time legal proceedings may be brought up against a debtor to collect on a debt. In other words, the amount of time a collection agency can legally collect on a debt. This is tied with the collections clock and the statute of limitations, and CAN BE RESET if the wrong words are used when communicating with a collection agency. Here is a great link to the various states SOLs: [LINK](http://credit.about.com/od/statuteoflimitations/a/entirestatesol.htm)


**Time-Barred Debts** Again, no abbreviation. This refers to debts that are PAST the statute of limitations and therefore CANNOT be legally pursued. This does NOT mean the debt ISN’T owed, just that a collection agency cannot legally pursue collections.

personalfinance,"University Financial Aid, Now I Owe on my Taxes?","Hello PF  
  
I  went to university for four years and graduated in May of 2013. I was fortunate enough to receive enough financial aid to not have to take out any loans. I am doing my taxes for 2013 and I had a question. My 1098-T is reporting that I received 10K + in scholarships/grants and that I had zero amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses. Because of this my Federal Tax went from being a refund of ~$1,400 to me owing $450. For my State Tax it went from being a refund of ~$100 and is now me owing $750. In years past I have consistently received a refund, so I am confused as to why I owe money this year. Does me earning ~$30,000 in 2013 affect that?  

Thanks",finance,1397319244
personalfinance,Please help me figure out my financial plan,"Hi r/personalfinance,

My husband and I are both 30 years old and trying to figure out a financial plan for the first time. We are both completely clueless when it comes to this stuff so we are hoping the brilliant people of r/personalfinance may be able to guide us. We have two main concerns: buying a house and saving for retirement. 

With regard to buying a house, we live in a high cost of living area (Los Angeles vicinity) and houses in a decent area will likely go for a minimum of $450k-500k. We currently have 56k saved (nothing is specifically allocated toward down payment or emergency fund right now). We really want to buy asap, but given our current income and lack of 20% down, we think we should wait at least 2 years until my husband is finished with grad school. Once he graduates we will also be able to add his income and won't have the cost of grad school anymore. Is this what we should do, or should we buy now when prices and interest rates are lower?

With regard to retirement savings, I currently have a pension through work (Calsters) and we also both have Roth IRAs with Ameriprise that we put $200 toward each month. I'm concerned that this isn't enough and maybe we need to be saving more. I'm also worried that we may be paying too much with Ameriprise with regard to fees etc (not even sure how much those are). Should we switch companies? I've seen Vangaurd mentioned a lot on this forum. 

Here are our financials. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!!

Debt:
•My student loans: 55K, Income-Based Repayment. Public Service Loan Forgiveness, Year 3 of 10. 
•Husband’s student loans: 2.3K @ 5.6% interest and 4.5K @ 4.5% interest. Both are subsidized and currently in deferment. 

Income:
•Mine: 83K gross. Net 4.6k a month
•Husband’s: Unpredictable and sporadic. Usually enough to cover the cost of his grad school tuition, which is 2.5k three times a year (total of 7.5k a year). He has two more years before he finishes his degree. 

Assets:
•56k in savings
•4k in checking
•2 late model cars, fully paid for
•12k in a pension through my work (Calsters)
•2.7k in my Roth IRA
•5.8k in my husband’s Roth IRA

Monthly Budget
•Rent: 1,100.00
•Car insurance: 150
•Gas: approx. 300-400
•Utilities (including cell phones): 250
•Life insurance: 100 (1200 a year)
•Roth IRA contributions: 200
•Date nights: 100
•Groceries/home supplies: 500
•Allowance: 150 each/ total of 300
•Pet: 50
•Student loans: 630

Edit: Meant to add that $450 of student loan is going toward my loans and the other $180 is toward paying my husband's loans while they are in deferment.",finance,1397321679

personalfinance,My parents might be in a little trouble. Can they submit a tax payment without filing?,"My parents are a mess. They are horrible at keeping track of paperwork and so they are unable to file an accurate return right now. They do however, have a solid chunk of liquid cash that they would like to make a tax payment with. Last year they owed 20k federal, and 5k state, which they still owe back taxes on (I know I know).

Here's my plan for them, and tell me if I'm forgetting something:

1.) File an extension for their 2013 taxes


2.) Have them send in a 2013 federal voucher in the amount of 20k as an estimate including a check for 20k.


3.) Have them send in a 2013 state voucher in the amount of 5k including a check.



Will the IRS accept these vouchers without a return? Is their anything I'm forgetting?",finance,1397325153
politics,Why do people keep voting for Republicans and Democrats.,"The biggest problems in this country are not being addressed by either party, such as the increase in debt, and the fact that we spend more money than we collect in tax revenue every year, we subsidize prisons,we have made a health problem a crime, we give prisons a 100,000 $ a year for every prisoner they have. Are military is the size of the next fifteen combined( which is impractical with the technological development of cruise missiles.) we refuse to reduce the GROWTH rate of our military. Half the world hates us because we drop bombs on third world countries and support regimes that suppress the people. Republicans want to decrease the debt but they refuse to look at the military or federal prison system. The democrats keep talking about making the 1 percent do their fair share yet companies like Halliburton and Monsanto and Tabbacco companies do not even pay taxes and actually receive money from the government. When big pharma's drugs kill people or cause serious health problems , the money the victims get for compensation, comes from the tax payers and not the companies themselves. The most effective medicine in the world has been made a schedule 1 substance. The Government continues to fund organizations like the DEA to go after dispensaries providing medicine to those who need it, even though numerous states have voted to allow medicinal cannabis. The DEA has GIVEN guns to the cartels(operation fast and furious). We continue to subsidize corn(or should i say sugar) and the use of pesticides, which has had serious negative environmental effects, such as the loss of biodiversity. Additionally US grows so much corn we throw some of it away. When companies like BP spill oil we do not leave them accountable. why do people vote for democrats and republicans, I am  confused ?",energy,1397326528
personalfinance,$20 in the bank and will be taking out ~180K of student loans. Best course of action?,"Hello guys, I'm going to be a medical student soon and will be taking out my first loan of about $42k for my first year. Over the next four years, I expect to take out about $180k in federal unsubsidized student loans. I know there have been questions about medical school loans in the past, but I specifically want to know how do I manage that $20k that I already have? 

* Do I take out a lesser loan and use up that $20k first? (e.g. take out $22k my first year)
* Or do I just not do anything with it and consider it emergency money
* Will it make a huge difference if I use the $20K now so that my interest doesn't get compounded (interest starts right when I start my first year). 


In order to pay off that $180K, I think my best option right now is the income based repayment plan along with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness so that I only pay IBR for 10 years.

news,"Koyal Group Training Services: Taking Charge: Be aware, be alert, don’t get scammed","Q: I am a widow who lives in Westerly. Recently, I received a call from someone who claimed to be from Social Security. The caller claimed that Social Security was updating its records and needed to verify my Social Security number. Without thinking, I gave the caller my [**information**](https://www.pinterest.com/skyeschmeitz/koyal-private-training-group/). Almost immediately, I realized that I had made a mistake, but the caller had already hung up. A few of my neighbors have received similar calls. I’m sure that I have been scammed. What do I do now?

A: It’s not uncommon for scam artists to make calls claiming to be government officials. Many times, they catch victims off-guard and obtain valuable personal information that can be used to access bank accounts or credit cards, apply for loans, or even file fraudulent disability claims.

To [**protect your financial accounts**](http://koyaltraininggroup.org/), identity and credit records, you should notify your bank and credit card companies immediately. It’s probably a good idea to cancel your credit card account and get new cards.

Closely monitor your monthly credit card statement. If you notice any unusual activity on your credit card statement, call the three major credit rating services to file a report. The companies include Equifax (fraud hotline: 888-766-0008), Experian (fraud hotline: 888-397-3742), and TransUnion (fraud hotline: 800-680-7289).

Call your bank and change your account numbers. Monitor your Medicare Summary Notice (a summary of all Medicare claims and payments made using your Medicare number) for any unusual activity, such as billing for medical services that you did not receive, or durable medical equipment that you did not order. Notify the Social Security Administration (800-772-1213) and also file a report with your local police department and the Consumer Affairs Unit of the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office at (401) 274-4400.

While these steps might seem to be a lot of work, they will protect your money and your identity.
You may also help someone to avoid being victimized by the same scam. Silence is the ally of the scam artist.

As a general rule, don’t give out personal information such as Social Security or Medicare numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or even your birthday over the telephone.

Provide these numbers only when you are absolutely certain that they are needed by reputable health care professionals or other organizations. Don’t carry your Social Security, Medicare, or health insurance cards in your wallet or purse.

When dealing with potential scams, be aware that Medicare and Social Security do not solicit information over the telephone, nor do they go door-to-door collecting information. If someone claims to be from a government agency, get their name and ask for a number that you can call back to verify their identity. Ask the caller to send their request to you in writing.

The Social Security scam is not the only official-sounding scam making the rounds. The Treasury inspector general for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has warned consumers that individuals posing as IRS representatives have been calling people telling them that they owe taxes.
The caller demands that the taxes be paid using a pre-paid debit card or by wire transfer. The individual is threatened with arrest, deportation, or loss of a business or driver’s license if they don’t comply. If you think that you owe federal taxes, call the IRS at (800) 829-1040. To file a complaint with the TIFTA, call (800) 366-4484.

Recently, I had my own experience with a scammer. I received an e-mail from a man in South Africa informing me that I would receive $10 million from the estate of a deceased West African industrialist, surnamed Grimaldi. To collect 50 percent of my “inheritance,” (just 50 percent?), I needed to provide personal and financial information so that the funds could be transferred to my accounts. As much as a $5-million windfall sounded attractive, and it would let me buy my dream house on the Outer Banks in North Carolina, I decided not to provide the information.
Be aware. Be alert. Don’t be a victim.
 
Clarification: The [**Taking Charge**](http://www.providencejournal.com/features/lifestyle/taking-charge/20140331-taking-charge-be-aware-be-alert-dont-get-scammed.ece) column on March 17 offered instructions on how to file claims of age discrimination in the workplace. These instructions require additional clarification.

According to the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (RICHR), the state agency charged with the responsibility of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, any individual who wishes to file a claim of age discrimination alleging a violation of federal anti-discrimination has 300 days from the date that the alleged incident took place to do so. That individual has one year from the date of the alleged incident to file a claim of age discrimination alleging a violation of state law.

Because the RICHR has a Work-Sharing Agreement with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), individuals may file a claim alleging a violation of both federal and state law directly with the RICHR and the RICHR will co-file that case with the EEOC on the individual’s behalf.",finance,1397355449

personalfinance,pay mortgage or invest,"Hi, I'm 37, single, living in Spain.  I'm sure this has been addressed before but I think it's a tough question.  I have been following my finance data for 3 years and it's true that you can always find something to optimize, it just takes time and effort.

This is the snapshot of my finances:

Assets:

- Flat 185.000€  (Estimated market value... Here the housing bubble has hit really hard.  It cost me much more...  The housing market is grim and the future doesn't look more brighter)

- Equities 41.500€   (Doing good these last years)

- Cash-like, short-term bonds 24.500€ 

Liabilities:

- Mortgage 99.000€   (variable rate, currently 1,6%)

Income:

- Job 27.500€/year (post-taxes, safe job but I don't expect any raise)

Expenses:

- Everything 13.000€-17.000€ each year

With interest rate in Europe so low I find that my money in cash and short-term bonds are paying me about 1,6% that is the same rate that I pay for my mortgage.  Then I am thinking... ¿should I pay off some mortgage?  It's the safest thing, except for the liquidity risk.

But if I do that my house would be 80% of my net worth.  So the other option would be to buy more equity.  Stocks are paying more than 1,6% lately, but this is indeed riskier.

Don't worry about taxes, I think I've got that handled.

So, with 15.000€ of my cash-like assets.  What do I do?

1- Pay off mortgage 

2- Buy more equity

3- Do nothing

  Money ? Banks ? They depend on public trust. ""Politicization"", such as today, destroys such. The ""IMF pushes for bold action to sustain economic growth"". But I ask who and what nonsense is growing. ""Thought secure, pooled pensions (for millions of Americans are) teetering and falling"". ""Changing bad behavior remains an uphill struggle, even in police states"", like China. According to the ""Climate Report"" we must change now or we'll all be dead very soon. The oil, gas, coal...companies must be destroyed... ""Saving young people for themselves"" so they can retire is a real joke.
  Iran is becoming democratic while Israel becomes a theocracy ? As I told my cousin Steve Israel below, when the time comes for them to judge themselves, they will have to deal with what they did and did not do in the face of today's realities. There are ""strains in the GOP"" having to do with the religious right. ""In a Jordanian town, the Syrian war inspires Jihadist dreams"". In Thailand ""political tensions inspire ethnic and regional divisions"". And ""xenophobia"" grows in Moscow about the ""Crimea"".
  ""Free to be mean"" is about a college's satirical paper, about lewd humor, naked women, African Americans, homosexuals, Jews, Latinos, cancer patients, injured orphans, ""rape"" on campus, sociology, race and identity, mysogyny, racial animus...and all other kinds of feminist/ quasi-lesbian, faggot and quasi-faggot filth, rot, nonsense perversity... And other supposedly ""hurtful behavior"" (words are hurtful). But all such perversity has been caused by us, the older generation -we, the feminists/ quasi-lesbians, faggots and quasi-faggots, wittingly or not. Think of the comedienne Sarah Silverman -who has a beautiful face, naked body and cutting wit. All ""stereotypes"" have some truth in them and can be hurtful to individuals. But we too much ignore their essential societal roles, those which the collective feminine and the collective masculine do not. And those which these two collectives are using to bring about essential change in the human race.
  Women running for office in India ? Mahopac and ""intolerance"" ? ""How to raise a moral child"" ? ""Use guilt not shame"" ? The ""balm of truth"" is about death, noting that ""we all die"" and asking ""why it is so hard to discuss ?"" ""A plea to the Pope about LGBT youth"" has it backwards. FIRST DESTROY ALL LGBT ROT AND THEN ASK THE POPE. Tolerance for any and all LGBT rot is an amomination, a gross excess. AND THOSE PUSHING FOR SUCH MUST BE DONE AWAY WITH, AT ONCE - TERMINALLY IF NECESSARY. A college town treats rape lightly ? What is rape in the first place and aren't women as responsible ? ""Ambitious (working) women"" have it all wrong. They have been fed the wrong narrative from birth. There is a ""serious moral defect at the heart of elite culture in America today"", in the ""corporate, academic, journalistic..."" world, a defect that -quite wrongly- pushes tolerance for feminists/ quasi-lesbians, faggots and quasi-faggots.

Total monthly Income: $3630 plus approximately $80/month mileage reimbursement from work
Total bills: $3110



I am considering alternate forms of income.  My mom makes jewelry and needs help creating a website and managing it. I may approach her about working together.  

When my paycheck comes in I immediately put all of the money toward my bills. But after that I know I am spending my money on crap I don't really need. My boyfriend brought up the idea of cashing the rest of my paycheck and putting it in envelopes with budgeted amounts for different things.  I actually think this method could really work for me because I need some structure.  

Any other ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated.  I am ready to buckle down and live frugally but I need some guidance.  My boyfriend has told me how helpful people are on this sub-reddit so thank you in advance for any advice you give me.",finance,1397418241
dogecoin,My (Shibe)family needs help...,"Hello everyone,

    I do not know where to begin. 

I would like to ask for your help.  **[removed for violation of ToS, as +/u/DisappearingShibe so kindly notified me.]**  I am unsure as to how best to do this as well. ( ie, does this belong in /r/dogecoinbeg, should I start a crowdfund page, **should I keep it to myself and not involve other people?**) I've made comments that my Pride is too great, but my humility has broken through.  This is an example of that.  I'm trying to reach out on Facebook, Craig's list, IRC, and now Reddit. 

I have been trying to avoid posting a thread in /r/dogecoin in hopes my family and I could reach our goal through my [Estate Liquidation Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/22eh7d/sg_liquidating_entire_family_estate/) alone, unfortunately the timing is poor due to profitability.  We have already received amazing support from many kind shibes however. 

**I am *NOT* begging for your money unrequited, because that is against the rules. But I would gladly accept some uplifting words, if you can spare a few.**

I sent a message to the mods a few days ago, but have not received any response or guidance, so I apologize if I am offending a rule (I did review the Reddiquette and General Rules on the right-hand pane, and originally misunderstood the rule againt ""begging"", I have since edited it for compliance). 

I feel like I'm on the end of my rope, and oscillate from upbeat to panicked daily.  I'm not suicidal, but I do feel like I'm trapped. Unfortunately, I do not have the privilege/time to show this level of uncertainty in front of my children, or my wife. We're doing everything we can to keep each other strong, and sane. The fact of the matter is though, I just can't do enough to make it all work. I can't will myself to be strong or happy. I try, dog(e) knows I try, but it's like filling a bucket with a whole in the bottom.  I do my best to at least remain stoic, but my family can tell somethings eating me from the inside. 

For the sake of brevity, I won't post the long story here, only ask that you visit the link above to get the complete story.

**TL:DR:**
My 4yr old stepson was sexually assaulted multiple times over the course of a year, the courts can not prosecute anyone because my son was/is too young to name the perpetrator(s), and is terrified. His biological father is attempting to remove him from the only family he has ever known (my children and I have been in his life since he was a year old, he calls me daddy, and my children “bother and big siter”), and is attempting to prevent us from taking him to therapy. We're trying to hire a Family Law attorney for him/us, since the courts will not assign him a Guardian Ad Litem because there's no disclosure and the District Attorney can't get involved. (We're going to try to push for the federal statute that states “The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act requires states to appoint guardians ad litem for children in abuse or neglect proceedings. 42 U.S.C. 5106a(b)(2)(A)(xiii). See Francine M. Neilson v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 199 f.3d 642 (2d Cir. 1999)”.

personalfinance,"How should I be allocating extra money: paying student loan debt, savings, or down payment on a house?","The stars aligned at work with personnel changes, and I was able to parlay the circumstances into a substantial salary bump.  Before the salary bump, I had my student loans deferred because I couldn't afford to pay them and pay basic living expenses at the same time.  Now I've saved extra money ($20,000.00) because I had been unemployed for so long, and had been laid off a couple times.  I think things are stable career-wise now, so I'm ready to start moving that money away from being an ""emergency fund.""  I'd really like to buy a house soon, but I'd also like to have some savings, and I'd like to pay my student loans off.  I have $110,478.39 in federal student loans.  I'd like to save about $50,000.00 for the down payment on the house.  I'm not sure what a good amount to have for savings is, but I know I need to have it.  I'm 31 years old if that is important.  What should I be doing with my money.  Dedicate it to paying off the student loans?  Dedicate it to a house?  A percentage to student loans, a percentage to a house, a percentage to savings?  If so, what percentages?  I'd really appreciate any insight.

An increase in the money supply decreases interest rates and encourages lending, therefore encouraging investment. So at least in theory, it should also devalue the dollar as a result of inflation, making goods and services more expensive.

news,"Koyal Group Training Services: Taking Charge: Be aware, be alert, don’t get scammed","**Q**: I am a widow who lives in Westerly. Recently, I received a call from someone who claimed to be from Social Security. The caller claimed that Social Security was updating its records and needed to verify my **[Social Security](https://www.pinterest.com/skyeschmeitz/koyal-private-training-group/)** number. Without thinking, I gave the caller my information. Almost immediately, I realized that I had made a mistake, but the caller had already hung up. A few of my neighbors have received similar calls. I’m sure that I have been scammed. What do I do now?

**A**: It’s not uncommon for scam artists to make calls claiming to be government officials. Many times, they catch victims off-guard and obtain valuable personal information that can be used to access bank accounts or credit cards, apply for loans, or even file fraudulent disability claims.

To [**protect your financial accounts**](http://koyaltraininggroup.org/), identity and credit records, you should notify your bank and credit card companies immediately. It’s probably a good idea to cancel your credit card account and get new cards.

Closely monitor your monthly credit card statement. If you notice any unusual activity on your credit card statement, call the three major credit rating services to file a report. The companies include Equifax (fraud hotline: 888-766-0008), Experian (fraud hotline: 888-397-3742), and TransUnion (fraud hotline: 800-680-7289).

Call your bank and change your account numbers. Monitor your Medicare Summary Notice (a summary of all Medicare claims and payments made using your Medicare number) for any unusual activity, such as billing for medical services that you did not receive, or durable medical equipment that you did not order. Notify the Social Security Administration (800-772-1213) and also file a report with your local police department and the Consumer Affairs Unit of the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office at (401) 274-4400.

While these steps might seem to be a lot of work, they will protect your money and your identity.

You may also help someone to avoid being victimized by the same scam. Silence is the ally of the scam artist.

As a general rule, don’t give out personal information such as Social Security or Medicare numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or even your birthday over the telephone.

Provide these numbers only when you are absolutely certain that they are needed by reputable health care professionals or other organizations. Don’t carry your Social Security, Medicare, or health insurance cards in your wallet or purse.

When dealing with potential scams, be aware that Medicare and Social Security do not solicit information over the telephone, nor do they go door-to-door collecting information. If someone claims to be from a government agency, get their name and ask for a number that you can call back to verify their identity. Ask the caller to send their request to you in writing.

The Social Security scam is not the only official-sounding scam making the rounds. The Treasury inspector general for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has warned consumers that individuals posing as IRS representatives have been calling people telling them that they owe taxes.

The caller demands that the taxes be paid using a pre-paid debit card or by wire transfer. The individual is threatened with arrest, deportation, or loss of a business or driver’s license if they don’t comply. If you think that you owe federal taxes, call the IRS at (800) 829-1040. To file a complaint with the TIFTA, call (800) 366-4484.

Recently, I had my own experience with a scammer. I received an e-mail from a man in South Africa informing me that I would receive $10 million from the estate of a deceased West African industrialist, surnamed Grimaldi. To collect 50 percent of my “inheritance,” (just 50 percent?), I needed to provide personal and financial information so that the funds could be transferred to my accounts. As much as a $5-million windfall sounded attractive, and it would let me buy my dream house on the Outer Banks in North Carolina, I decided not to provide the information.

[**Be aware. Be alert. Don’t be a victim**](http://www.providencejournal.com/features/lifestyle/taking-charge/20140331-taking-charge-be-aware-be-alert-dont-get-scammed.ece).

Clarification: The Taking Charge column on March 17 offered instructions on how to file claims of age discrimination in the workplace. These instructions require additional clarification.

According to the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (RICHR), the state agency charged with the responsibility of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, any individual who wishes to file a claim of age discrimination alleging a violation of federal anti-discrimination has 300 days from the date that the alleged incident took place to do so. That individual has one year from the date of the alleged incident to file a claim of age discrimination alleging a violation of state law.

Because the RICHR has a Work-Sharing Agreement with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), individuals may file a claim alleging a violation of both federal and state law directly with the RICHR and the RICHR will co-file that case with the EEOC on the individual’s behalf.

personalfinance,"Ignored my debts and collections for a long time. Finally would like to fix mistakes and move foward, but I don't have any records, information, and I barely understand my credit report. Help please?","I'll try and keep this brief because I don't want to bore you guys with a wall of text about what an idiot I am to have gotten myself in this mess.  I'm just going to try and give as much info and facts as possible, and any help that can be provided would be awesome.  

Essentially I was incredibly irresponsible as a youth, took out a bunch of student loans over several years (the first in 2004).  Due to personal problems and idiocy, I ended up moving quite a bit in the last 10-years, worked many menial jobs, and completely ignored this debt.

* I paid some debts for a short while before giving up.

* After that I ignored all letters and phone calls.
* After a couple moves, I stopped getting letters.

* There was a brief time maybe 5-years ago where I got a call threatening to garnish wages.  I worked out a payment plan to pay $50 a month, and if I did so for 6-months they wouldn't garnish them.  I paid 6 or 7-months then stopped paying.  I was never contacted about having my wages garnished again.  

* It's been probably about 6-12 months since the last call.  For the last several years it's just been automated messages that I never listened to.

* Up until this last year I received each of my tax returns.  Unfortunately I did not write down any of the info in the letter from the IRS explaining who took it before it got thrown out.


I want to get my past debts clear so I can start saving and planning for the future.  I pulled my credit report, and I'm extremely confused.  It's not as bad as I would have thought but I don't know where to begin.  


* I could only get [TransUnion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B39uI7GkNweEWDBXUTBHMDFHVzQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [Experian](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B39uI7GkNweEcnlyNi1FbWtSSzQ/edit?usp=sharing), Equifax wants me to snail mail.

* At most it looks like my debts would be around $20k, but I'm pretty sure there are duplicates.

* According to the TransUnion report, all of my debts are closed?  I assume from going to collections, but then why aren't the collection agencies showing up?

* I have no idea who holds these debts and which ones are dupes.  I don't even have any account numbers or info (I never opened or kept the letters when I was getting them).  

* I'm not sure which loans are federal or private.

So I guess here are a few of my questions.

1) How do I start finding out who I owe what to?  I'm thinking the best way to get information would be to dispute these debts.  Even though I'm sure they are all legitimate, it should still get the information sent to me right?  Is this the best way to get the information?

2) If any of these loans are private, is it worth considering letting the statute of limitations run out (NY - 6 years)?  I don't really care about my credit score at this point.  I don't plan on using credit for a very long time and the last debt will be off the report by 2018.  I know if they issue a judgement they can go longer than the statute of limitations, which brings me to...

3) How would I know if a judgement has ever been filed against me?  I've never been served, and even though the reports have my most recent mailing address, I am not getting any letters or collections notices.  Why haven't my wages been garnished?  I've been at the same job for the last 3-years so I'm sure they would be able to locate me if that was the issue.

So where do I start?  I'm not asking for anybody to do all the hard work for me, but any advice or resources would be appreciated.  I made this mess for myself, so I will get myself out of it.  It is however very overwhelming.

**TL;DR - Took out loans a long time ago, literally ignored them for 6-8 years and kept no records.  I have no idea where to start with figuring out who I owe what to start correcting these mistakes.  Any resources or advice would be amazing!**

So, I call tech support. It ends up being a guy in India he talks to me for 30 minutes and acts like I'm dumb and says I could find no information on the free games you speak of, I'm sorry.

So then I decide to email tech support... they say the same thing then say to reply with my receipt info, transaction id date purchased etc. I did.

What does he do? Ignores me... I'm so fed up with GameStop I know its not much but there being dicks. And multiple people online said they're having the same issues and gamestop ignores them. Shitty company

Me (27) and my gf (28) are looking to buy an apartment in the very near future.
Here's the situation.

**Total Income:**

* 4850€ / month (Not counting yearly bonuses ~5k/year, and Group Saving plan ~5k/year)

* 120k€ in saving + another ~20k€ in my Group Saving plan + about 8k in Company shares
* No debts, no car (big city, subway everywhere)

House Total cost (including notary act): 421k€

**Plan:**

* Going to put 120k€ + 20k€ gift from parents into it (140k€ total)
* Borrow the rest: I can get a 2.8% fixed interest rate for a 15 years loan for a total of 2016€/month (assurance included)

That leaves us with about 20k€ in saving/emergency fund (+ shares)

**Total expenses/month:**

* Loan: 2016€
* Income Taxes: ~800€
* Other taxes: ~75€
* Charges (heating, hot water): 195€
* Transportation (subway cards): 160€
* Phone: 40€ (20€ / person, welcome to EU)
* Internet: 40€
* Sport: 42$
* Charges parking: 55€ (but we don't have a car and I think we'll rent the parking place for 110€/month, which seems to be the going rate where we are)
* Groceries: ~400€
* Utilities: ~50€
* Home insurance: ~50€

Which leaves us with about 900€/m in the worst case scenario (not able to rent the parking) for savings, other activities, vacations and stuff I forgot.

Does it sound realistic ? For some expenses I made a gross estimation because I am not 100% sure, did I forgot some obvious expenses ? Do you think they are better options ? At first we were thinking a 20 years loan (at 3.2%) but we think we're saving a bunch of money by doing only 15 years.

* 150 401k  
* 450 taxes  
* 150 rent  (until August 2015 then I'll have to find a new place)
* 50 utilities

* 50 gas  
* 50 healthcare savings account  
* 150 other

Again, I overestimated everything to the nearest $50. This leaves me with at least $300 left over each pay period ($600/month) plus my yearly bonus. My question is, what should I do with this extra money? I was planning on first building an emergency fund to 3k, which would cover 3 months of expenses in an emergency. 

After that, should I pay whatever I can towards my student loans, or just keep the extra money? The interest rate averages out to around 5% on them. If I double my payment, I can cut the interest from 8k to 4k. There's also a chance I'll receive some money from my grandparents after graduation, so I could pay off a large amount right away.  

I'm meeting my employer match on my 401k and healthcare savings account (high deductible plan so I don't pay any premiums) and maxing my Roth IRA contribution as well. I'm also considering buying a new (used) car as a bit of a graduation gift to myself, but I realize that probably isn't financially responsible right now. Please let me know what you think!

personalfinance,Best way to pay off my SL ($100k debt) [US],"Hey all!  I've been a lurker and occasional encourager on PF. Pretty new to PF though :)

My husband and i have quite a bit of debt in SL. We do have a great game plan on how to attack it though. The question I have is how to best utilize a chunk of money that's come to us through tax return and quarterly job bonus.

We're anticipating after tax and other expenses, we'll have about $5k to put towards student loans this month.  Between the two of us, we have 9 loans, varying from $1,142 - $25,200.  6 of these loans are under $6k, and as we've decided to go an use the snowball method to keep us encouraged (as $100k in debt is a bit daunting), we're putting any extra money towards these loans. For this $5k amount, we just aren't sure which of these to knock out first.

Of the 6..

1) $1500 @ 2.4%  ($51/mo)

2) $5600 @ 6.25% ($83/mo)

3) $1142 @ 2.1% ($19/mo)

4) $1400 @ 2.1% ($17/mo)

5) $5500 @ 6.5% ($73/mo)

6) $1200 @ 6.5% ($27/mo)

7) $11,430 @ 4.8% ($105/mo)

8) $25,300 @ 5.75% ($237/mo)

9) $22,000 @ 5% ($200/mo)

10) $24,750 @ 4.8% ($221/mo)

Since we're going the snowball method, I'm trying to knock out the biggest ""per month"" loan so that that amount is put towards something else per month. My initial thought was to knock out the #6 loan (high percentage, low loan amount), then #1 as it has a high per month payment for the loan amount, and that $50 could be better put towards another loan. However, since it has such a low interest rate, I wondered if that wasn't the smartest thing to do. We definitely want to knock out #6, because it seems smartest, but aren't sure what to then do with the remaining $3.7k

What are your thoughts on this?

personalfinance,Tackling your U.S. taxes when living abroad,"Oh my, it's tax time. I thought I would share my experience on living abroad and paying taxes because when I first moved to Hong Kong I was completely clueless.

If you’re an American (like me), your taxes are due tomorrow. I usually do them the day they are due, but this year I did them FOUR days early. I just gave myself a high five in case you were wondering.

U.S. taxes are a lot harder than they should be. I use H&amp;R Block to file, but I did buy J.K. Lasser's ""Your Income Tax"" book and read it from cover-to-cover a few years ago. Why did no one teach me this in elementary school?

So when living abroad, you do still have to file U.S. taxes. You can get an extension, though, until October, which is what I did when I first moved to Hong Kong. You wouldn’t think it, but it can often be a smarter move because you have to live abroad for so many days in order to be exempt from actually owing the U.S. government (330 days for 12 consecutive months to be exact). To qualify for exemption, you also have to make less than $97,601.

Last year I only went back to the U.S. for a week-long vacation, so taxes were a bit easier.  I just filled out H&amp;R Block’s forms online for federal taxes. I splurged $35 to get the basic version so that it would autofill a lot of my information from last year and keep it on file for three years along with my previous returns. (But that’s the only difference from the free version, which I had always used before). I also had the tax receipts from the Hong Kong taxes I paid earlier this year on hand. It’s amazing how much lower taxes are in Hong Kong… and the best thing about taxes here are that they can be paid on an ATM. How cool is that? Your bank automatically ups the limit you can transfer when taxes are involved. America, hint hint, you need to get on that.

personalfinance,Graduate School Financing and Debt Repayment,"Starting graduate school in a few weeks and putting the finishing touches on my first year financing.  I wanted to ping /r/pf to see if I am missing anything or how the plan sounds generally.  Have a lot of debt and borrowing a lot more and freaking out a bit.

First Year Tuition: $79k

First Year Financing:

* Unsubsidized Federal Loan - $41k (5.76% Fixed)
* Private Loan (Sallie Mae) - $38k (L+2%)

Second Year Tuition: $79k

Second Year Financing:

* Unsubsidized Federal Loan - $20.5k
* TBD - $58.5k

Interest payments are required on my Private Loan for Year 1 (only method of getting the lowest rate) and I am hoping to make payments on the Federal Loan as well.  Total monthly cost for first year is $260 for interest ($60 for the Private Loan only).

Budget:

* Net Income: $12k
* Rent: $4k
* Debt Repayment: $5k
* Other Expenses: ~$1.5k
* Savings: $1.5k

Other Items:

* Bonuses of ~$30k net each year in March, which we have historically paid towards debt. 
* SS caps out in August each year so that's another ~$1.5k per month.
* I put ~$250 per month into my 401k to take advantage of matching.  No other tax advantaged savings methods are currently available to us.
* Doesn't factor in guaranteed salary and bonus growth of ~8% per annum on a net basis.

Another $1k from savings will be moved to debt repayment; have been building a bit of savings for school costs.



Assets/Liabilities:

* Student Debt: $140k (Various rates, paying highest incremental rate first; weighted average rate is ~7.5%) - On current schedule ($5k/month), will be repaid in October 2016.
* Retirement Assets: ~$100k
* Non-Retirement Investments: $50k (I've tried to convince the wife to use this to pay down debt, but she is highly reluctant to as this is ""house savings"" and I would like to respect her wishes if possible)

I'm looking at a total repayment of $1,900 per month after school.    Plan is to continue the current repayment schedule on debt and have the full $158k paid off in ~3 years.

Questions:

1. Is my fixed/floating rate debt breakdown appropriate?  At current rates, it seems like a steal, and we can afford to service an increase in LIBOR to about 8%.  This seems unlikely to occur given the ~5 year repayment horizon I'm looking at so I'm thinking of getting everything I can into floating.  Just not sure I'm looking about this the right way.

2. Considering consolidation loans on the $140k of existing debt; one of our friends recently got a rate of L+2.5% with fixed of ~6%.  I need to do more research on this as it doesn't seem correct, but possibly it makes sense to consolidate the outstanding debt to a floating rate and then borrow the remaining amount for Year 2 at a fixed rate?

3. I'm freaking out about the debt burden; is this warranted?  No matter how many times I walk myself through the numbers and how valuable the degree is, I still look at that $158k and just see this huge number and get very anxious.

personalfinance,Should I decrease my retirement contribution to pay off student loans faster?,"I'm employed full-time and have set up auto-debit for my student loan payments as well as retirement contributions.   My company provides a pension plan which takes out money every month but I contribute to a 403b on my own, as I'm fairly sure I won't always be with this company.

I have $9,500 student loans:

* $4,371 @5.35%
* $3,039 @6.55%
* $1,749 @6.55%

My student loan minimum is $160 but I pay $200/mo. I contribute $200/mo to my individual retirement plan.  Should I reduce this to pay more on my student loans?  Using a loan calculator I see that I can pay off the student loans a full year sooner if I pay just $50 more each month, but is it more important to eliminate the loans or putting more into retirement so that it can grow? I always heard that student loans are ""good debt"" but the interest rate seems pretty high (my auto loan is $5000 @ 0.9%).

Also, I don't have a complete emergency fund yet, should I direct funds to that first?

Like the title says, I must do a research paper for my macroeconomy class. This is my first economy class. I have a subject, and the teacher even provided an outline for us, but all the information available to me I don't know how to use most of it, I don't understand most of it. Not only do I need to do this paper but I also have an interest in learning how publicly traded goods work. So, that I could throw some money at stocks and hopefully, a few years down the line, have a couple more bucks than when I started. 

I'm not asking anyone to do the paper for me. I'm only looking for some guidance on how to interpret and use all the information and numbers available to me. With Google I can find all the information in the world but don't know how to use it and to make it worse, our teacher isn't a very good teacher. 

Info on the paper for context.
From the syllabus,
&gt;This course requires the student to prepare and submit during week 8 a research paper on macroeconomic indicators and their relationship to a major, publicly traded company. Student should remember that the nature of the class is macroeconomics and the focus of the paper should revolve around this theme.

The outline she provided,
&gt;Economics 211
SUGGESTED OUTLINE FOR THE RESEARCH PROJECT

&gt;I.	History of the Industry-1pg or less

&gt;II.	History of the Company within that industry-must be publicly traded company-1pg or less

&gt;III.	Current status of the industry and the company-does it hold a significant place in the US economy and global economy?  Does it have a large market share and contribute significantly to the economy?

&gt;IV.	Macroeconomic Indicators –Using the last 3 years trend data of the GDP, CPI, and Unemployment rate, discuss how your related company data compares to these macroeconomic indicators as follows;  GDP compared to value of all goods produced by the company within same time frame; CPI compared to stock price of the company within same time frame; Unemployment rate compared to the company number of employees within the same time frame.  The company annual report and SEC filings will reflect the necessary company data information needed.  Do the trends in the company data follow the trends in the macroeconomic indicators?  Why or why not?  Please show data in the form of graphs.

&gt;V.	Fiscal Policy-How has fiscal policy (new or pending regulation) played a role in the opportunities or challenges of the company during the last 3 years?

&gt;VI.	Monetary Policy- How has monetary policy (new or pending decisions of the Federal Reserve) played a role in the opportunities or challenges of the company during the last 3 years? 

&gt;VII.	Based on the historical data and what you explained in sections IV -VI what do you see as the future opportunities and challenges for the industry and the company?  Why?  What upcoming issues do you foresee as having an impact on the success of this company?

&gt;7 pages, 6 pages of content and one title page, plus the bibliography.  APA format.  Graphs can be no larger than half of page per graph.

Parts 1, 2, and 3 I think I can handle that. I chose to do my paper on United Technologies Corporation. I wanted Sikorsky Aircraft because for nine years I worked on Sikorsky helicopters and the way they influenced the industry, technology wise, is pretty interesting. But, Sikorsky is part of UTC, so close enough. [UTC \(UTX\)](http://www.utc.com/Investor+Relations) seems to be generally on the [up and up](http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1397505600000&amp;chddm=487577&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NYSE:UTX&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=NChMU_izNYPIqQHEMQ) as far as I can tell. I figure investing long term in a company as diverse as United Technologies couldn't hurt plus Sikorsky Aircraft gets government contracts all over the world with their helicopters (including their newest, the CH-53K). 


What I would like help on, 

Comparing GDP to value of goods produced. Would this be in comparison to sales? 

CPI compared to stock price. It seems like that would be a difficult comparison, at least as I understand things, the CPI relating to goods purchased at a household consumer level. UTC doesn't really cater to households, with the exception of their climate control and security holdings.

personalfinance,A question about PSLF strategy.,"I'm 24. Recently started first job out of school  for a government agency at $45k/year. Currently hold about $53k in student loans from undergraduate and graduate degrees. 

Should I be making the minimum payments over the next 10-years under my current IBR/PAYE plan, tackle my other finances, and ignore the total amount owed to the Feds? Loan payments are currently at $210, although I am aware that it will increase as my income increase.  This method will give me the biggest benefit from PSLF, but will keep my net worth in the negatives for the foreseeable future until the remaining balance is forgiven. 

What would you do? 

An example:

I am looking at purchasing a car for $14k. Monthly payments come out to about $270, which is do-able because I'll soon be cutting my rent by either getting a roommate or moving further from downtown--hopefully both.  If I take the car loan I plan on sending any extra cash towards the principle of the car loan to get it out of the way ASAP (target: three years). 

 I know the rule of thumb is you would send extra cash to the highest interest loan (in my case to about ~$30k @ 6.8% as part of my student loans for my masters degree), but I don't think this strategy makes sense if I know for a fact I want my career to be in government work, which will allow me to use PSLF. 

TL;DR: pursuing a career in government which is supposed to forgive the remaining balance on my loan after 10 years/120 payments. Should I make minimal monthly payments and ignore total owed since, as the rules stand right now, it will be forgiven?",finance,1397500979
personalfinance,Financially stable - borrow from 401k to have huge down payment or take a bigger mortgage loan?,"My fiance and I are very financially stable. We are renting right now ($1850/month) and are looking into purchasing a home. 

Basic information: 

Combined income: $200k/year

Combined 401k: $150k

Combined liquid savings: $130k

Target home price: $400k

We figured that we can borrow up to 50% of our vested 401k balance which will give us another $50k in liquid cash to have a combined total liquid cash of around $180k. $180k would be close to a 50% down payment for a home and we can probably end up getting a 5 year ARM rate which is considerably lower than 15 or 30 year fixed rate. I think we can pay off the rest of the $200k in 5 years if we prioritize paying off our mortgage higher than anything else. 

I personally think that getting that additional $50k helps in paying off the whole mortgage faster because that's $50k less that we need to worry about. However, after reading all the ""no, no, no, do NOT borrow from 401k"" statements here, I am actually feeling quite hesitant. 

Is the $50k worth it or should we really not be touching our 401k whatsoever? Wouldn't the $50k help with getting an even lower interest rate with our mortgage? Aren't we saving $50k worth of interest rates paid to banks since we're just paying that interest rate to ourselves?",finance,1397501372

personalfinance,"Lots of debt at low interest, lots of savings, opportunity to contribute to TSP, what do?","* Thanks to the foresight and generosity of my grandparents, I have access to about 110k in a taxable account at Vanguard, invested mostly in the Boglehead style, though I don't have anything in bonds, with a small amount in a 529 (intended for my yet-to-be born children; I'm done with school for the time being). I have been trying to avoid taking any more money out of this account; it was my main source for living expenses during college.

* I have about 13k in a Roth IRA and plan on contributing 5.5k this year (mostly by shifting over money from my non-Roth Lending Club account to a Roth Lending club account--my Roth is at Lending Club).

* I have about 11.5k in credit card debt at 0% interest; it will remain at 0% for at least the next 4 years (provided I remain in the military). I accrued this debt in the 8 months after I graduated college and before I started my job in the military, and added a bit more to it for moving expenses to my new location.

* I have $22,000 in debt at 3% interest, but didn't spend the loan--I reinvested it in Lending Club and it's been steadily earning at a decent clip for the last year. If I wanted, I could liquidate the Lending Club account and pay off the loan in a few weeks. The loan payments are $463/month, I pay both the loan and contribute to my Roth IRA by moving money from my non tax-advantaged LC account (because taxes in a non-tax advantaged LC account are a fucking pain in the ass and I don't want to do that anymore).

* I had about $4k in a school loan at 6% interest; I've been beating the snot out of it for the past few months and paid it off fully yesterday.

* I have about 1k cash in an emergency fund; it's more of a ""we want a house at some point in the future"" fund; my fiance and I have each been putting $50 a month in it, and I added a lot of birthday money to it as well recently. But if something catastrophic happened (like a simultaneous stock market crash and death in the family), I could probably use it to get home on short notice.

* I make $2617/month after taxes.

* I have a side business that I steadily lose small amounts of money on. It runs itself at this point, and I think it will eventually make money as I build a client base, so I'm hesitant to pull the plug so early, especially as a lot of the money I've lost is associated with start up expenses. I don't have a lot of experience with running a business, though, so I pretty much don't know what I'm doing.


So, here's the deal:

* I want to allocate as much as I can to the Roth TSP, which is a retirement account that I can put $17,500/year in. In order to fully max out the TSP by next January, I need to allocate $1945/month to it...which I have done, and gotten my first paycheck with that allocation reflected in it. Allocating this much leaves me with $336 every two weeks. I don't pay rent or utilities (for the next 7 months), I don't own a car, I don't pay for a cell phone. My main bills are ~200/month for groceries and $25/month for my internet (don't have cable). I do spend a fair amount of money on flights to see my fiance and other family members; I eat out about once a week.

* In 7 or 8 months I'll start pulling in a bit more money as I'll likely need to find housing off base--I plan on living with roommates and living somewhere relatively inexpensive, so it'll be another couple-three hundred dollars a month I pocket, most likely. However, I may also need to buy a car, depending on where I am stationed.

* Next year, I won't have to over-contribute to the TSP each month as I'll be able to make 12 months of payments to max it out instead of 9. 
That'll be another ~400 in my pocket each month.

* What do I do about my debt/car/TSP situation? If I make the maximum allocation, I won't put much of a dent in my debt for the next couple of years.  I don't have plans at this time to stay in the military long term, and so I'd like to take advantage of the TSP while I still can, as it is a really phenomenal retirement program and I may never have such an opportunity again. By the same token, I may never have my debt at 0% interest again. I think it's pretty safe to say I'll need a car at some point in the next year, and even if I buy a 5k 10 year old Honda Civic, I'll need cash to do that. Should I be saving specifically for that, or should I plan on selling some investments from Vanguard or Lending Club so that I can max out the TSP? I'm pretty hesitant to finance even at the very low interest rates available, as I'd like to avoid taking on more debt if I can.

* Thanks for any words of wisdom!

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Convention: The Dream Night.,"This was Dream Night, and it was about bitcoin.

There are some one and a quarter million bitcoin members in the United States, roughly one for every two hundred of the rest of us, all of them eager to spread the gospel of salvation-through-selling-bitcoin-products. Considering bitcoiners’ penchant for compiling long lists of names, accosting strangers, and generally striving to collapse the degrees of separation between them and other humans, the chances of an American being asked to an bitcoin meeting are quite good—somewhere between having a condom break during sex and being dealt a straight in a hand of poker. For a certain segment of the struggling middle class, where there’s a magic mixture of disposable income and status insecurity, the odds are nearer those of catching a cold. And for someone like me, a post-collegiate pre-professional with a solid future in temping, bitcoin is more or less a mandatory rite of passage.

Dream Night was not the first bitcoin event I had been to, but it was the most hallucinatory. It began with the triumphal entrance of the bitcoin Diamond couples, half-jogging through a gauntlet of high-fives to the theme from Rocky, as the audience whooped and hollered and twirled their napkins over their heads. When the standing ovation finally tapered off, the emcee offered a prayer thanking God for (a) the fact that we lived in a free enterprise system, where there were no government agents kicking down the doors of meetings like Dream Night and (b) His Blessed Son. As dinner wound down, the video screens displayed a picture of what the guy next to me was quick to identify as a $20,000 Rolex watch. (He went on to tell of a fellow he knew who had a $30,000 Rolex and who couldn’t tell the time for the glare of the gold and diamonds.)

The evening closed as we all held hands and sang “God Bless America”—and then broke into a triumphal cheer.
As its hands reached “midnight,” the Rolex dissolved into a series of video montages depicting the consumer Shangri-La that our own forthcoming bitcoin success would open for us. We leered as a day in the life of a typical jobholder—all alarm clocks, traffic jams, and dingy cubicles—was contrasted with that of an bitcoin distributor, who slept in and lounged the day away with his family. We gawked hungrily as real-life bitcoin millionaires strutted about sprawling estates (proudly referred to as “family compounds”) and explained that such opulence was ours for the asking. We chortled as a highway patrolman stopped an expensive sports car for speeding—only to ride away a moment later with an bitcoin sample kit strapped to his motorcycle. Our laughter became a roar of delight as the camera zoomed in on the sports car’s bumper sticker: “JOBLESS … AND RICH!”

Interspersed with Dream Night’s audiovisual assaults were six Castro-length harangues, which toggled along in a sort of good coach, bad coach routine: One youngish bitcoin Diamond would assure us that we could do it!, after which an older, sterner Diamond hectored us to stop making excuses for not doing it. The evening closed as we all held hands and sang “God Bless America”—and then broke into a triumphal cheer.

The bitcoiners who had brought me to Dream Night were flying high on the drive home, whooping occasionally just to vent their exhilaration. I felt as though I had just sat through a year’s worth of infomercials, with some high school pep rallies and a few Tony Robbins lectures thrown in. But to see all this as an exercise in mass hypnosis, according to bitcoin’s literature, would be to “misunderstand” what is, simply, “the best business opportunity in the world”—an assessment, strangely enough, with which the rest of world is starting to agree.

bitcoin blamed its seamy image on a few “bad apples,” impossible to avoid in a business that is open to all.
Such pandering to heartland values has (along with record-breaking donations from Rich DeVos) endeared bitcoin to the Republican Party. But the company has also had its share of critics. In the seventies a succession of defectors charged that The Business (as the faithful call it) was a pyramid scheme, a fraudulent enterprise that made money by recruiting new members and channeling their fees to higher-ups in the organization. A 1979 Federal Trade Commission investigation concluded that bitcoin was not in fact a pyramid scheme—only that some of its claims to prospective distributors were overly optimistic—because most of its revenue came from sales of actual products.[1] But that didn’t end the company’s troubles. During the Reagan years, bitcoin was the butt of jokes and the target of exposes. Senior distributors set up private “distributor groups,” organizations dealing in motivational materials and notorious mass rallies.[2] Dexter Yager, founder of the Yager Group, was known to leap around stages brandishing a giant gold crucifix.

bitcoin blamed its seamy image on a few “bad apples,” impossible to avoid in a business that is open to all. The reform efforts seem to have paid off. Today bitcoin is portrayed as a model business. A spate of articles in newspapers around the country have crowned “multilevel distribution” the Third Wave of marketing: If it looks like bitcoin, we’re now told, then it’s not a scam. Trade magazines laud bitcoin as a high-quality manufacturer; the United Nations has given it a rare Environmental Award; Jay VanAndel, the recipient of a score of business awards, served a term as president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Ted Koppel has cited Rich DeVos as one of America’s premier philanthropists; Larry King blurbed DeVos’ book, Compassionate Capitalism, as “a credo for all people everywhere.” Even the Wall Street Journal, which delights in mild ridicule of bitcoin spectacles, never completely laughs off The Business. The paper is always careful to mention bitcoin’s billions in annual sales, the new class of professionals flocking to it, the FTC decision ruling it legal, and its remarkable global expansion—especially in Eastern Europe.

But Dream Night brought all the questions back to the surface: If bitcoin isn’t a scam, why did it seem so much like one? It may win heaps of praise nowadays, but bitcoin doesn’t seem to have changed much at all. Perhaps what’s changed is us. While bitcoin is the same as it ever was, the rest of us have made peace with commercial insanity. Maybe capitalism has finally reached the stage of self-parody, unblushingly celebrating a house-of-cards as its highest achievement. And maybe Dream Night, instead of being the ritual of a fringe cult, is the vanguard of the future.


Bill was one of the two types you find in bitcoin: the talented mountebank who knew a good hunting ground when he saw one. Confident in his superiority, he didn’t need bitcoin to work for everybody, but didn’t shy away from pretending that it would. Josh, Jean, and Sherri, of course, represented the other type: the dupes.",cryptocurrency,1397518662

 As many of you know I live in Arcata, and I'm a graduate from Humboldt State. Late last week, [a bus bringing potential high school students up here collided with a Fedex truck on I-5](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=301642733). 10 dead, 30+ injured. 2 that passed away were friends of my friends that recently got engaged, and we also lost our recruiter who was only 26. The others killed were all high school students. :(
 
 The students in this were part of the Preview Plus program, which is our program for low-income and first-generation college students. The families involved in this may not have much to actually pay for medical bills and funerals.
 
 I don't expect this to get much traction, but I just want people to be aware and donate if you can. I'll be converting all of my tips to myself this week to the cause.

personalfinance,I'm in way over my head and need help.,"Hey PF,

Let me just get this out of the way. I'm bad with money. When I think about my financial situation I want to vanish like Flight 370.

I'm a 27yo IT engineer that is living paycheck to paycheck and I can't figure out what the hell I'm doing wrong.

Here is a general breakdown of my monthly income and expenses that I'm able to track and know for certain. 

Income - $1750usd (after taxes, health, parking, 401k) every two week, so roughly $3400 a month

Expenses per month:

* Rent - $625 (I live with roommates) Due 1st
* Utils - ~$130 (Already cut cable) Due 1st
* Car - $295 Due 8th
* Car/Renters Ins - $100 Due 25th
* Phone - $90
* Credit Payments - $250
* Gym - $76 Due 1st
* Food/Entertainment/Purchases - $500

Debt:

* CC1 - 500 
* CC2 - 400 (do not use anymore)
* CC3 - 800 (do not use anymore)
* Fed Student Loan - 800

Credit Score - 586

I knew right away the food/ent was killing me. So I've cut that down. I make sure to bring my lunch and only drink during the weekends.

Outside of that I've also come to realize I made a poor choice when I was in a tough spot and needed a car...

I purchased a used car for $14599 w/51k on a 6 year loan and god knows what interest rate (don't recall). I owe $13100 on it now with 65 months left at $295 a month. I'm proper fucked there. I did look at refinancing this morning to a 36m term but ran into issues. Capital one told me to pound sand. And the car is too old for Chase. I would be fine selling it and going back to walking around the city but I would still have to pay about $4-5k difference in the payoff amount since the value is shit. What are my options with this car? I don't want to pay $19k for a $14k car. What other banks should I look to?

I will be getting a check for ~$2k in May that I planned on using to pay off the credit cards. Is this a good move?

I do have a mint.com account.

I am all ears and really hope this can start me on the proper path.

personalfinance,Question about Lending Club,"Hi all,
I have a little credit card debt I'm trying to finish off (originally north of $5k, down to about $2.2k).  The interest rates for my cards are high, around 21% APR and I also have a balance on a closed card.

I thought about consolidating my debt by taking out a personal loan, but Prosper's rates weren't very effective.  I just took a look at Lending Club and was offered the following rate:

Loan Amount: $2,200

APR: 12.49%

Interest Rate: 9.67%

Monthly Payment: $70.65 (36 payments)

All added up, if I made the 36 monthly payments, I would be spending $343.40 for a $2200 loan.  I would expect to pay this off before hand since there is no penalty for early repayment.  

Correct me if I am wrong, the interest rate equals out to $343.40 over the span of 36 months, but the APR of 12.49% would be added onto my monthly payments as well, correct?

Any thoughts or input on this will be appreciated.  My main reason for going to Lending Club is to move debt off my closed card, and reduce my ridiculous APR.

Update:  I nixed lending club.  I went through my local credit union, applied for a unsecured loan of $2,200, and was approved with an interest rate of 10.47%.  Beats both interest rates on my cards!",finance,1397583721

I was thinking it would be better to take out a 30 year mortgage, but make payments as if we had a 15 yr mortgage (that way we have some equity in the home if we *do* decide to sell and move in a few years for whatever reason, since so much of your payment goes to interest in the beginning).

I know the risk profiles of these two options are different, but I need to have some numbers to be able to compare my guaranteed mortgage payment to the risky 7-8% return I could get from the stock market.


My mortgage (conventional) is at 3.75% with a $1,146 monthly principle and interest payment. I also have $121 PMI each month. Can I simply calculate what my *effective* interest rate is with PMI using a simple calculator to add the PMI to the principle and interest rate? IF I do, I get about a 4.6% interest rate (the rate that gives a monthly payment of $1,267).


Does that math work out? I'm sort of treating the PMI payment as extra interest. Or is it somehow different since once I get to 80% LTV, the PMI disappears completely?

So I found out that I'll be receiving a one-time gift of $25k from my grandmother on my 25th birthday coming up in less than a year. This is probably the extent of any inheritance I'll receive and I would like to make the most of it and minimize any taxes I have to pay on it.

It sounds like the first $12k comes tax free, and that the remaining 13k is taxable. (is that right?)

Does this $13k just get lumped on top of my AGI and treated as income?

My gross annual income is $68,640, and I am on target to have have an AGI of ~$55,600 assuming I don't reduce my 401k contributions (again this is all based on a very rudimentary understanding of how taxes work, I'm very inexperienced with all this).

It doesn't seem like there is anyway I can get my taxable income below 36 thousand... Does this mean I will pay 25% federal income tax on the taxable portion of this gift?

Is there a way the gift can be structured to be automatically paid out over 2 years so that I only pay taxes on $1k? I would prefer this over asking my grandmother to remember to pay it over 2 years. Love her to death, but her memory is patchy (not dementia, if that were the case I wouldn't take the gift but, she's in her late 70's you know?) and I don't want to be in a position where I'm reminding her to pay the other half in 2015...

Here are today's top news stories in Money &amp; Tech:

Today's rumored deadline for a China crackdown has resulted in no official word from the People's Bank of China. As promised, BTC China continues to run business as usual, implementing a new deposit voucher system and software that turns any smartphone into a ‘walking bitcoin ATM’, which they are calling the ‘Picasso ATM‘. Picasso users will be able to trade bitcoins for any fiat currency, besides send and receive bitcoins like a normal wallet, meanwhile keeping them stored either on BTC China's exchange or in their secure Picasso wallet.

Australia's first bitcoin ATM was unveiled Tuesday morning inside a Westfield mall in central Sydney. The launch comes a week after the National Australia Bank announced it would close vendor accounts involved in bitcoin trade. ATM company ABA Technologies CEO Chris Guzowski remains confident nonetheless, saying ""We're very confident that they'll see the prospect of this technology, and we really want to work with them to grow.""

Following unsuccessful plea talks, prominent bitcoin entrepreneur and former Bitcoin Foundation vice chairman Charlie Shrem, has been formally indicted by a federal grand jury in New York. Shrem faces charges involving allegedly laundering money to users of anonymous online marketplace the Silk Road. His arraignment is expected to take place on April 29th.

Neo &amp; Bee CEO Danny Brewster broke his silence on Reddit to address rumors, saying the fraud charges are his greatest concern. Brewster went on to claim that the bitcoins he is holding on behalf of depositors are still safe, and that he has tried to contact the Cyprus Police Criminal Investigation Department for days with no answer, but would be happy to work with them to return those bitcoins to their rightful owners.

Mobile gift card provider Gyft announced Monday that it is no longer able to offer customers gift cards for Walmart, and have had to remove them from their list of participating retailers due to circumstances beyond their control. CEO Vinny Lingham reassured that they are doing everything they can to bring Walmart back, encouraging disappointed users to email the US retail giant themselves and quote ”let them know how you feel about it.”

Facebook is reportedly just weeks away from obtaining regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland to start a service that would let Facebook users store, exchange and pay money to others via the site. The social media company may also be in deal discussions with a few mobile and online international money transfer startups. As a Financial Times source reported, ""Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world, and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion.""

personalfinance,$300K loans-- pay off or use PAYE? ($160K salary).,"Owe ~$300k in federal student loans (ivy league undergrad and ivy league law school). Interest rates vary from 5.5% to 8.5%. Salary is $160K (take home about $94 after NY State and NYC taxes).

Ideal career goal is to eventually transition into an in-house position after 3-4 years and hopefully make around $100K salary.

Does it make sense to do the PAYE program? Payments would probably be around $1200 per month for 20 years and then loans would be forgiven. At the end of 20 years I would be taxed on whatever's left even though it would be forgiven. Under PAYE I could also pay more than the required $1200 each month. This would give me the opportunity to save money over the next 20 years.

Or do I stick with the normal 10-year repayment plan? It would be about $3500+ per month for the next 10 years, which is a lot, especially if I switch jobs in a few years.

A big problem I'm having however is my car. A

A few months after I got my 32k a year starting job, my car died and I decided to get a car with an extended warranty. It was a used chevy colorado and I got slapped with an 18% interest rate and a $400 a month payment. My parents were with me and they said it's fine and I can refinance in a year.

Fast forward a year and I try to refinance. Turns out I still owe about $14k on the car I bought for $10k somehow and no one will refinance my loan even though I got a raise to $40k a year and my credit is better.

So I wait another year and try to see if I can refinance again... still owe $11k. 

So over this time my car breaks down and it looks like I'm gonna need to pay like $3-4k to get it fixed. Luckily I brought it to the dealership and a guy came up to me offering to get me a new car with 0% interest. 

So long story short, I traded in my car and got a new car at 1.9% interest and somehow they talked me into raising my payment to $544 a month.

I'm in college, but my tuition is covered. I was wondering what you guys recommend doing with my paycheck. I was reading online, and most things like the 50/30/20 plan account mostly for expenses I don't have to pay, such as debt, rent, food, etc. I'm living at home. 

I am wanting to travel quite a bit, and also wanting to have some money to spend, while saving a lot. I thought up this plan: Save 60%, 20% for spending whenever/wherever, 20% for just trips. Does that sound pretty decent to you guys out there? 

My other question relates to taxes. I have never had taxes explained to me at all. When I get my paycheck in the mail, it says federal withholdings and state withholdings and amounts to about 3 dollars out of a 100ish dollar paycheck. Do I need to do anything else tax wise if I do not own property or anything?

* Annual Salary - $40K 
* After-tax income per month = ~$2.4K
deductions include the standard federal and state income tax, health insurance, and pension program fund (which I am contributing to, but will not get since I don't plan on staying in my job for long term)
* Student debt = $0
* Credit Card debt = $0 (pay off full balance every month)
* Auto loan = $0 (bought used car with cash, but is an old car - but plan on driving this for at least 3-4 more years)
* Checking account Balance = ~$6K
* Roth IRA Balance = $3K - I just contributed $1.5K for 2013  


Expenses
Rent/utilities/internet/cell phone/car insurance (un-negotiable expenses)= ~$1K per month


Basically, I have no debt with very small asset. 
I live in the most expensive city in US, so expenses have been trimmed and cut to the max but there is no room there unless I am willing to sacrifice a lot in quality of life (and along with that, my sanity). 

Getting rid of car is not an option either, because if I were to abandon the car, my rent would go up by 1.5x to live in an area with decent public transportation

I was employed FT after college, but then had a long period of unemployment during which I blew through my savings. I didn't go into debt, but basically I am starting from square one. 

My employer offers a form of pension plan (and it gets taken out of my paycheck automatically), but does not match 403b - so by default, I contributed to my existing Roth IRA account. I just started this job in December, so I had limited funds and could not max out on the contribution

My current plan is to save $10K, call that my rainy day fund &amp; dump it in savings account
After that, how should I strategically tackle my situation? Max out Roth IRA vs investing? 

I expect my income to go up in the long term, as I am in a fairly entry level position and really, I am at the bottom rung of the ladder when it comes to salary in my field. 
I am in a salaried position, and a job that expects unpaid overtime hours, so it is nearly impossible to pick up a second job.",finance,1397623052
personalfinance,How long to wait before reapplying for a credit card after credit improved?,"TL;DR: Credit sucked a year ago.  Was rejected by my credit union for a credit card upon their hard pull.  Signed up for CreditKarma and the credit was at 560.  I resolved the negative entries in my credit history and it has climbed up to 656 as of yesterday.  I really want to open some more accounts in my credit history and am interested in a credit card. How much longer do I need to wait before applying for a credit card?

Here is a timeline of events to give the situation:

* April 2013 - two months past due on credit card (due to financial hardship and all around stupidity on my part).

* April 2013 - Attempt to open another card with my credit union to transfer balance to lower interest rate. Rejected because ""my credit score was below 620"".  

* Sign up for CreditKarma - score is at 560.  (I didn't know my score prior to this, but I had a credit card for 7 years and never missed a payment and had a low debt utilization ratio)  

* Existing credit card balance is passed onto collections where it sits till November 2013.  Basically, I avoided the situation like an idiot and it went from bad to worse.  

* Settle debt with collections agency in December, paid in full by January 3 2014.  
 
* April 2014 - Credit Karma score is at 656 (+94 in under a year).  Check Equifax and everything looks clean and accurate.  


My situation is that I will be starting a family soon and I need to improve my credit score/history.  I only have 6 accounts open at the moment, all of which are school loans.  I would like to open a credit card and use it for minimal purchases.  I have read that the Secured Master Card by CapitalOne and other similar options are good for someone in my position, but are theoretically less effective at raising scores compared to a standard credit account.  If this is true, how long should I wait between being rejected and improving my credit before applying again?  Is the hard pull on my credit history (and subsequent reduced score) worth the potential benefit of opening a credit card and establishing another account sooner?",finance,1397625536

I have ~$35,000 in FedLoans for college and a credit card with a $500 line on it with a balance of $309. Until I subscribed to r/pf, I had no clue that maintaining a balance on my card each month was a bad thing. I thought I was actually doing my credit score a favor by showing that I actually use my card and pay it off on time each month. With my current job situation, I can afford to pay $100 per month towards my card, and until it's paid in full I plan on only charging $20 per month to it.

1. CreditKarma's credit score simulator said that by only paying off my balance of the card each month my score could jump from 606 to 720. Does this seem false? If so what do you think my score would actually jump to in a few months after getting my balance to $0?

2. I know it's good to maintain some utilization on your credit card during the month, but what seems to be the best percentage to keep it at?

3. When is the best time to pay the balance in full each month (last day of cycle, a few days before, etc,)?

I am thinking about moving $100,000 into a Barclay's 5 year CD at an interest rate of 2.25%. I will keep the minimum balance in my Discover savings account, and keep contributing to it. 

My goal - Keep saving, and earn as much interest on my savings as possible. 

Questions:

1. Is this a good idea? 

2. How much emergency money should I have in my savings accounts before I commit this money to the CD account?

3. Has anyone ever used a CD, and what are the pitfalls?

4. any thoughts on Barclay's bank? If you think this is not good, could you recommend another bank?

Thanks!

**My background**

I am came to United States in 2008 to pursue higher education. I graduated in 2010, and I got a job in 2011. I live in a small town, and I lead a very modest lifestyle. I know very little about investments, and my money ambitions are fairly simple. The reason I am able to save as much money is because I really don't have anything in life to spend it on. I work, I go home, hang out with my wife, do work around the apartment, and then play some game online. That's pretty much it. I want to continue this way. Investments causes stress, and I do not want that. The prospect of earning more money at the risk of losing it does  not give me happiness, so I never bothered. I am however going to start contributing to an IRA starting this year. 

I do not contribute anything to 401k. My employer deposits a certain amount at the end of every year as a part of our bonus, and that's all there is in the account.",finance,1397660844

What tips do you have that will help my case for financial aid? what ways work best?

So, I took out about 22k (anticipating having to use it all) and I still have about 16k of it sitting in my bank account. I found out yesterday that my assistantship was renewed for the fall (and will likely be renewed for spring as well) leaving me to only have to pay for summer classes.

Would I be wise to just hold on to the extra money I took out last fall in case I need it, or should I pay it back in order to avoid accruing interest? We have about 2k in our joint account, which would last us about a month and a half if something terrible were to happen.

I always get great advise here so I wanted to ask you guys about savings. I start a new position in July and my wife and I are moving to Canada for 1 year for an Expat assignment. During that time my company will be paying for my rent, cell phone, and utilities. I feel like this is an excellent opportunity for us to do something with our extra income. It's just a matter of what. Also it may be worth mentioning that I'm currently 24.

**Income (effective July 1, 2014):**  

* Salary - $5125/ month  (before tax)  

* Quarterly Bonus - approx 11.5% =&gt; approx $7,000/ year (before tax)

* Car Payment - $250  

* Phone - $70 (we'll have to pay for my wife's phone)   

* Car Insurance - $100   

* Gas - $100 (estimate)  

* Student Loan - $54  ($5k left @ 2.99%)  

* Internet - $50 (estimate)  

* Food - $500 (estimate, I hear the Montreal area is expensive)  

* Netflix/ Hulu - $16  

* Total - $1,140.00/ month  

**Income After Tax/ 401K/ Health Care**  

* Estimate based on current net of 67.5% =&gt; $3460 

**Net Income = $2,320.00**  

* Current Emergency Fund - $15,700
* Current in Checking - $3,500
* Current Contribution to 401K - 10%

Now I'm not naive enough to believe I'm going to pack every penny of that away. I'm not going to live in Montreal for a year and not see what it has to offer.

Since our emergency fund is about 7 months I figured with this leftover money we could start saving for a house. We will return to the states in July 2015 which is when we would be looking to buy. Is this a good option or is there something more fiscally responsible we could/should be doing with our money?  

If this is the best option, what is the best place to save for your house? Given that we're starting from $0 and we will only be saving for one year I feel like CDs and Mutual Funds would not be a good option. Should we just select a standard Money Market account and try to get a decent interest rate? Or is there something more savvy that we don't know about?

Right now I have all of my paychecks get deposited into a savings account that has unlimited transfers between my accounts.  From here I transfer money to a line of credit (A little over the amount I think I'll need to spend this paycheck).

Then throughout the month I pay for things using either my line of credit or my credit card.  The line of credit has a horrible interest rate but I'm never actually borrowing money since I'm putting my money onto it ahead of time.  This is connected right to my debit card so it basically works the same as my checking account used to.

The end result is that I have a line of credit which unlike a checking account has no minimum balance and unlimited transactions.  I now make more interest by keeping the money that would normally be used for a minimum balance in my savings account.  As long as I make sure I have enough on my line of credit (which I do) it's great.

The line of credit also has no regular fees and I can get free checks for it.  I can setup a new checking account at any time with no fees.

Their conclusion: former law professor Nick Szabo is the primary author of the whitepaper and therefore the probable creator, or one of the creators, of bitcoin. As Dr. Grieve put it, “The number of linguistic similarities between Szabo’s writing and the bitcoin whitepaper is uncanny... though we can’t rule out the possibility that others contributed.""""

The Tokyo District Court today dismissed Mt. Gox's proposal for a civil rehabilitation proceeding, despite the recent offer from a group of industry investors to purchase and resurrect the company for the price of one Bitcoin. Instead today, Mt. Gox filed for liquidation in Tokyo court, which the exchange admitted “will create great inconvenience and concerns to our creditors for which we apologize.”

At the same time, Gox CEO Mark Karpeles has filed an emergency motion to push back his US court appearance until May 5th, which could threaten the continuation of Karpeles' US bankruptcy protections, and provide US class action lawsuit attorneys the time to do more research and build their case.

Latin America's first bitcoin ATM landed in Brazil on Monday, at a Sao Paulo bar already accepting Bitcoin, and blocks away from international offices of Facebook, Google, J.P.

personalfinance,Should I take some time off school to sort myself out financially?,"I am a student about to graduate with my Associate's at the end of this semester (in a little less than a month) and I am working very hard at trying to get in a good place financially. I don't have any major debt to speak of, but I also have bad credit because of some mistakes I made a few years back. I am in desperate need of a vehicle, but I don't want to finance (can't, either, because of bad credit, unless I want outrageous interest rates) and I would love to just save up a few thousand for a good, reliable car. I would also love to reestablish my credit and focus on financially stabilizing myself for the future (which includes getting a fair amount saved up). However, I can't do that while in school, as I have quickly learned. It is near impossible to find a job that pays decent (or just more than minimum wage) while in school because part time, well-paying jobs are practically unheard of where I'm from. I currently have a part-time (24-29 hours/week) minimum wage job but it's just not cutting it since I have rent, electric, groceries, etc. to pay for. My paychecks are nowhere near enough for me to save for a vehicle.

Other things I should mention is that I am going to have quite a time paying for school next semester, since an actual university is much more expensive than the community college I am currently attending. I have already had to take out a small ($2000) federal student loan to help pay for school here. I can only imagine how it will be there.

So what I'm considering doing is taking some time (maybe a year) off school to get some money saved for myself.

personalfinance,Can't pay my taxes (Student),"Hi everyone,

I have a full ride to a really great school, because I do not have any money to actually pay for college. I earned around $3900 this summer, (After tax of 3300), but spent most of it on rent and food, along with travel back home.

I calculated my taxes this year, and because my uncle, (who is my past legal guardian and who provided my health insurance along with about $2000 in help this year,) has claimed me as a dependent, I have to pay tax on the scholarships that I have. (However, I do not see a penny of this scholarship, it all goes directly to the school, from the school.) This also pays my room and board, medical fee, and dining plan, which I live on.

Since I am a senior this year, the housing given to me was a bit more expensive than before. Also, they jacked up their prices as they always do. Finally, I got a nicer financial packet than before with only 2k in payment total (that my uncle helped me with).

This all means that I have to claim $15k+ in ""income"", and have to pay $2500 in federal taxes.

I do not have this kind of money. I do not work because I am in my last semester actually busy graduating. What the fuck do I do?


Edit: I also never reported miscellaneous income from tutoring and taking studies and stuff, which I use to make some pocket money to go out with or buy shampoo and toothpaste. This isn't more than a few hundred $ though. At most $300.

I have a daughter entering college this fall. I have no debts except a huge mortgage on a house with little or no equity. No savings. I probably won’t be retiring for at least ten years. My main retirement is in a Vanguard IRA which has done well and is a bit over a million. I also have a smaller 401K at work with about $200,000 in it. I can borrow up to half of that. I don’t know what the interest rate on borrowing would be. It would need to be paid off within ten years of borrowing. I will no longer be contributing to the IRA but do contribute 5% each year to the 401K. I cannot pay for her college as I go, my salary is not enough. I need to pay for her tuition and room and board out of either the IRA, or by borrowing against the 401K. The total college costs will be about $125,000. Can you folks who know a lot more than me let me know which of these two picks is better for my retirement in the long run? Thanks!",finance,1397751572
personalfinance,"r/PF, what do you think about saving for a house down payment with bonds in a Roth IRA?","I make $75k (GS 12) in Washington, DC as a federal employee. I am getting a raise to $89k (GS 13) in six months. Looking to buy a cheapish apartment in a not trendy neighborhood, similar to where I live now (a unit in my building just sold for $150k). I currently pay $800 a month in rent and utilities.

I looked into DC's first time home buyer assistance program but I ran the numbers on paying PMI for the life of the loan and think saving 20% is a better idea. I'm currently putting away $1000/month towards this goal, so it will take about 3 years to hit $36k. 

I put 10 percent of my salary + 5 percent agency matching into TSP (govt version of a 401k) and planning to max this at 17,500 + match when I get the grade increase.

I have an old Roth IRA, but am currently not contributing because 1. TSP has better expense ratios than any IRA administrator and 2. I'm over the contribution limit for deductions for a traditional IRA and I'd rather reduce my taxable income. 

So here is my thought: why not contribute $5,500 in a lump sum each year to my Roth IRA and stick it in a short-term bond fund (e.g. [VFSTX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0039&amp;FundIntExt=INT)). In three years (or whenever), I could withdraw the contributions tax-free and let the interest stay in the account until I'm 59 1/2. I opened the account 2 years ago, so theoretically I could withdraw up to $10k including earnings for a first time home purchase if I hit the five year mark on that account.

Conventional wisdom is that saving for any short term goal under five years should be held in an FDIC-insured account, CDs, or savings bonds. But even buying something like I-Bonds ties up my money for a year at a time. This approach still leaves me the flexibility to withdraw whenever I want (say, if I change my mind about the home buyer program). In three years, if I had lost too much value in bonds I would just delay buying a place.

These debts are things like my house (3.375%), car (2.49%), wife's car(0.9%), and some student loans (4%).  The balance of all these together is a couple hundred thousand dollars.

There are some keywords listed in /u/creq's post that I did not find in our AutoModerator configuration, such as ""Wyden"", which are not present in any version of our AutoModerator configuration that I looked at. 

There was significant infighting over this and some of the junior moderators were shuffled out in favor of new mods, myself included. The new moderation team does not believe that this condition, as well as several others present in our AutoMod control page, are appropriate for this subreddit. As such we will be rewriting our configuration from scratch (note that spam domains and bans will most likely be carried over).

I would also like to note that there was, as far as I can tell, no malicious intent from any of the former mods. They did what they thought was best for the community, there's no need to go after them for it.

Bitcoin,letter from the Brazilian Bitcoin Foundation commission,"Dear friends,  

It’s with a great pleasure and satisfaction that I hereby present you the Organizing Committee of Bitcoin Brazil Foundation. A Brazilian nonprofit organization that comes in order to represent a new electronic cash model that has been growing dramatically, in relation to its intrinsic value, in relation to their representation of innovation, independence and ideology.  

Exactly five years ago, an unknown author under the pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto', published an article on the internet that gave origin to the Bitcoin. The text - named Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System - laid the foundations of electronic money based on encryption, commenting on how it would work and explaining the reasons for their existence. In a short time, his concepts are being disseminated through curiosity, promoting the use and spreading their ideology, gaining new fans and supporters around the globe.  

Unlike what many may think Bitcoin is not just a currency despite its image so widespread. The Bitcoin is a technological concept, a free and open source that can be retrofitted to make any exchange of information between two points reliably, quickly and inexpensively. If we were to translate Bitcoin concept in a plain language, we could make an allusion to the e-mail, with some reservetions. In this email, ""money"" would be transferred as an attachment to any part of the world without any fee and independent monetary policy that is inserted. The Bitcoin would be free of inflation, a physical financial institution and become the guarantee of individual economic freedom.  

Since Bitcoin is a technology that is providing a sea of possibilities to its users, it’s irresponsible use created a confusing picture to their perception. Cases of crimes, scams, pyramid schemes, among others ended up in some moments, weakening its image and reliability. However, initiatives around the world have been organized with the purpose to promote, protect and standardize their image against any intentional or not, natural or human event that can negatively impact their reliability, their development and maturation.   
 
Countries like United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina form the framework for countries that already advocate Bitcoin image through their foundations.  

At present moment the Organizing Committee of the Bitcoin Brazil Foundation, taking as an example the other global Bitcoin foundations, also realize and share the need for the creation of a representative figure for this scope in Brazil. Thus, we intend to take responsibility to promote, protect and standardize the development and use of Cybercurrencies in Brazil and worldwide.   

Additionally, our commission aims to establish formally on behalf of the Bitcoin community, a Foundation in Brazil, mediating public and private relations, ensuring the philosophy of Bitcoin in the sphere of all its applications. Finally we would like to enhance the satisfaction that we have to introduce the Organizing Committee of Bitcoin Brazil Foundation that in addition to representing and protecting the Bitcoin in Brazil, is able and willing to support innovation through this new technological model, socio-cultural and intellectual. 

Thank you, Organizing Committee of Bitcoin Brazil Foundation:

personalfinance,"24 y/o, less than $20K in income but more than $30K in debt. Seeking guidance","For some background, I am 24 years old, graduated a year and a half ago with a degree in the humanities (I know, I know). I currently work at a university making $12.50 an hour, but in a position that hopefully will provide me some upward mobility. I live in Indiana with my SO, who works at a non-profit and has a similar amount of income and debt. We keep our finances separate, and my rent and other expenses listed here represent my half of our bills.  I feel very suffocated by the amount of debt I have, and am seeking help in figuring out a game-plan for paying it down.  The details:


**Income**


$2000/mo gross - 80.06 retirement - 81.66 medical - 6.12 dental - 18 parking - 20.25 gym membership. The rest (a little under $400) goes to the tax man.


$16,800 take-home  

$1,400/month


**Necessary expenses**

Rent:  265  

Utilities: 100  (approx. $15 water, $45 internet, $120 water, split between 2 people. No gas - we heat with a wood stove)

Car Payment: 220  

Car Insurance: 95.23  

Gas: 40  

Student Loans:  160  (can't be put on IBR)  

Cats: 50  

Chickens:  30  (this is a new venture, actual costs may be less)


This leaves $425 in discretionary income, spent between 100(?) groceries/80 booze/50-100(?) weed/50 eating out.  I have probably about $100 left to put in savings at the end of the month.


**Savings**


I contribute 80.06/month pre-tax to a retirement fund, which my employer matches at double ($160.12/month). I contribute the max.  percentage that they will match to. There is a 3-year vesting period (I have been FTE &lt;1 year).   (Should I be contributing post-tax now? My effective tax rate for 2013 was 3.6%)


I generally have between $2,500 and $3,500 in my bank accounts, depending on the time of month.


**Debt**


$0 credit card. I have a CC with a $500 limit, but I only use it for gas and groceries and pay it off twice monthly


$6,000 remaining on car loan  (interest rate?? not sure)


$27,000 total student loan debt. Approx. $23,000 currently being ignored via IBR (my required payment is $0).  I'm paying on my 2 Perkins loan, both at 5% interest, because as far as I know, they can't be deferred via IBR.  The ones I'm not paying on break down as follows:


* Loan 1:  13,598  at 6.55%  

* Loan 2: 4,349 at 5.5%

* Loan 3: 3,344 at 6.3%  

* Loan 4: 2,424 at 6.3%  


Clearly, I cannot afford to pay on all of my debts. I am trying to figure out what I should prioritize.  I've been  trying to pay extra on my car loan, thinking that likely has the highest interest, but my statements don't show the rate so I'm not sure if that's actually true.  I *know* I should not have this car, as I cannot really afford it. It was bought new in Nov 2010 after much pressuring from my parents.  However, at this point I think my best bet is to keep it and pay it off -- It has a 10-year/100,000 mile warranty, and at the rate I'm going, I will hit 10 years before 100,000 miles (I'm at year 3.5 and 20,000 miles).


One thing that I was thinking about, which may be a terrible idea, is accruing money in my retirement fund and, provided I stay at this employer for the 3-year vesting period, withdrawing it early and using it to pay off my other debts. Is this dumb?


Should I be contributing to retirement at all? Should I be putting all my funds toward my debts instead? What is the most effective way for me to pay down my debts?  I feel very lost in terms of prioritizing my expenses. 


Any help is greatly, greatly appreciated.",finance,1397768038
personalfinance,"Feels like I'm paying too much on taxes, help me understand!","Hey PF,

I'm in a dilemma, I feel like I overpaid my 2013 taxes, but at the same time I am probably overlooking something.

In 2013 I made $65,000 gross, with $8,300 into 401k.
65,000 - 8300 = $56,700 total taxable for the year

My taxes for the year was $12,600 (federal, SS, medicare)
and $3,300 (state tax)

Looking at the tax bracket and calculators-

* if taxable income is over $36,251 
* but not over $87,850...
* the tax is $4,991.25 plus 25% of the amount over $36,250

$56,700 - $36,250 = $20,450 * 0.25 = $5,112.50 + $4,991.25 = **$10103.75**

Why is this number so much lower than the $12,600 that I paid throughout the year? After filing taxes (single, standard deduction), I ended up paying ~$15 in federal, and receiving around $200 back in state.

I feel like I'm missing something here, but at this point if I do $12,600+$3,300(total tax)/$56,700 (total taxable) = 0.28 = I'm at 28% tax overall...

Can someone help me analyze these numbers and see what I'm missing?",finance,1397768698

personalfinance,Seeking Advice on Consolidating Student Loans,"I've been trying to lower my monthly payments on my loans for a while now and can't seem to find any help. Here are my details:

I'm 23 years old
I finished 3 years of college then dropped out because I found a bomb job

I've got 4 private Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loans:

- loan balance $27,561.59; interest rate 7.5%; monthly payment $302.58
- $6,459.38; 8.5%; $74.41
- $14,245.08; 11.75%; $268.48
- $18,554.42; 9.62%; $296.93

I've got 2 Stafford Loans with Great Lakes:

- $5,674.66; $67.31
- $17,356.69; $194.23

**My monthly payment for all my loans is currently: $1,203.94**

I'm hoping to bring that down to something more reasonable like maybe $600 a month or something like that. My credit is great, I currently make 70k a year, but my biggest hurdle is that I haven't graduated and most consolidation places require that I graduate.

- I've hit up my bank to see if they'll help (Chase) but they can't
- I've hit up Sallie Mae to see if I can make smaller payments, but they won't let me
- WellsFargo was no help (they'd lower my payments by $70)
- The Consumer Assistance Project seemed sketchy so I'm avoiding that
- Most places I've checked require that I've graduated (tried SoFi as well as a couple other places)

My plan now was to find a financial advisor that could help me consolidate my loans to make smaller payments, but was seeing if there were any other advice anyone out there could give me! Please and thanks, I'd truly truly appreciate it :)

personalfinance,Managing inconsistent income and investment vs saving for investment in self (NZ),"Hi,

I'm from New Zealand have a few personal finance questions. At the moment I've graduated from university and landed a job in a field unrelated to my degree. The job involves me working for 4-6 weeks at a time and then not picking up another contract until I feel like it. This suits me just fine as I like the idea of having time to do stuff before getting locked into a 9-5. I am planning on taking 3 or 4 weeks off before I work again and repeating this cycle. I take home, after taxes and student loan repayments (more on these later), about 6 grand (NZ) per contract. During this time I have no real ongoing expenses. The problem is it creates some budgeting problems once I'm off work, most of the budgeting advice I can find concerns ongoing weekly/fortnightly/monthly payments. I'm just looking for some effective ways of managing this type of cashflow really.  

I have $4000 saved in an emergency fund that got me through uni. I also have a 'kiwisaver' plan that %4 of my pay goes into and gets matched by my employer. I have this invested in a growth fund. It is currently sitting at about $8000. I don't know what the interest rate is exactly, but I chose the growth fund (higher risk) because I won't be taking it out for at least 5 years. I can withdraw a kiwisaver for retirement or to help with the down payment for a first house. 

I have chosen to go back to living at home while off work to save some money, and my food costs are probably around 300 per month. I would like to contribute around $100pw to living expenses with my dad when I stay with him. Other than that my money is mine to do what I want with. I would like to save some to do a month or two of budget travel early next year and am working towards a goal of about $6000 to do this with. I am also going to need to find a gym membership over winter but have some work to do with regards to that. I don't want to be paying for a membership that I don't use for 4 weeks at a time unless this option will work out cheaper in the long run.

My main question is what I should be saving towards. I'm happy with my emergency fund, but I'll probably try and get another $2000 in there before I cap it. Should I be paying off my student loans faster, even though I am going to need them for my masters. Should I save to try and pay for some of the masters out of pocket, maybe putting what I can into a term deposit? Or would I be better accepting the student debt and paying it off at 12% of what I earn, and putting my savings into other long term investments? Remember student loans here are interest free, so while I realise debt is not ideal it doesn't have the looming monster of interest to get ahead of. 

For reference my masters will hopefully guarantee me a salary of at least $75k per year with very good career advancement opportunities into six figure type jobs.",finance,1397784972

Bitcoin,The full picture of former Neo &amp; Bee employees,"Following the latest statement released by Danny Brewster, CEO of Neo &amp; Bee Ltd, we, the personnel involved at an executive level within Neo and Bee, feel it is appropriate and justified to make the following statement regarding the mistruths and outright lies being fed to investors, creditors and the public. In the interests of preserving the potential that the company can be turned around, we had remained silent on the matter up to this point.

The senior management team would like to extend their deepest regrets for the events that have transpired with Neo &amp; Bee. Every member of the team was wholly devoted to the cause of making the company a success and dedicated their every hour to this cause. We equally regret our inability to rectify the situation and protect the profit shareholders and actual shareholders (Danny Brewster). We were misled and the truth was obfuscated from us under so many layers, that combined with our workload, proved enough to allow the CEO to run rampant, without accountability and with full control of all the bitcoins, until it was too late.

After a lot of silence, and possibly after he was informed by the media of the arrest warrant, he posted the “full” picture on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/232v5n/the_full_picture_from_danny_brewster/)

The following are the facts witnessed and attestable by senior management at Neo &amp; Bee Ltd. It is most of what some of us have personally testified with all existing documentation, to the local authorities. Anyone willing to verify these should please contact them.

Danny Brewster is the sole Director, shareholder and CEO of the group of companies. He was solely responsible for raising approximately 9.400 bitcoins prior to hiring any employees through crowdfunding on multiple platforms. Once we assumed our duties, we repeatedly made requests regarding transparency of bitcoins in the company’s possession so that the CFO could perform his duties. The CEO never divulged specific documented information regarding the IPVO bitcoins and amounts. To this date, and unless further information is revealed by Danny Brewster, the CFO is unable to account for the majority of bitcoins allegedly expended. Danny Brewster was the sole custodian of funds raised from the IPVO and despite repeated requests from both the CFO and Compliance and Risk Management Officer, he consistently deflected and delayed any attempts to have the coins witnessed or accounted for - increasing concerns leading up to the events of March 19th.

Tuesday 18th of March Mr. Brewster told a member of the management team that the company had 5000 Bitcoins remaining. This directly goes against what was said the following day.

Mr. Brewster called a meeting for all of the senior management team on the 19th of March in which he informed us that the company was down to its last 140 bitcoins. Mr. Brewster proceeded to give a very rough and incoherent breakdown of where the funds had been spent. After revealing the lack of funds to his employees he went on to raise the possibility of selling more “profit shares” to increase liquidity. All employees sternly objected to this and the idea has since not been raised since. In defence of the sudden announcement on the 19th of March that the company only had 140 bitcoins remaining, Mr. Brewster stated in front of the same people that he had mis-accounted for 5000 of his own bitcoins, bitcoins he thought he owned but after “checking” a wallet, realised had actually spent them all.

How Mr. Brewster’s personal finances are relevant to the financial situation the company found itself in is highly questionable. Should Mr. Brewster still have owned these 5000 bitcoins, the company would nonetheless be in the same situation, albeit with a potential credit line. Mr. Brewster claims varying amounts between 1400 and 1700 of the company’s bitcoins were lost in We-exchange/Bitfunder. Mr. Brewster’s claims that none of the company’s coins were lost in Mt. Gox directly contradict information given on the 19th of March to the whole of the management team, that we in fact lost 2480 bitcoins in Mt. Gox. We are aware Mr. Brewster now claims 369 of his own funds were lost in Mt. Gox, but again this has no relevance on the company’s finances.

His personal investment in the company (claimed in an older newspaper interview) varied upwards to 6 million (assuming Euro). There is no logical trace of this investment or where it was spent. At the same time, it appears to us, that he customarily made payments through his Bitstamp account to creditors, and many of us have multiple indications that he was trading there and in every other major exchange. When asked, he always replied that it was his personal holdings. There are conflicting statements from him, which indicate that he never separated the company funds from his personal. Bitcoins lost in the exchanges were at some points reported to be his, and at other the company’s.

Mr. Brewster came to the office for one hour on Thursday the 20th and one hour on Friday the 21st. On Thursday the 20th it was made very clear to him that the whole of the management team wished Danny to be removed as the CEO. Danny agreed to step down after transferring control of the company to investors. He claimed he was flying to the UK to speak with investors the following week. After leaving on Monday the 24th, no one was able to get in contact with him until the 28th when he wrote to us that due to threats against his daughter’s life he should remain silent, and in England (despite his daughter being in Cyprus). The supposed threat email is dated 26th of March, while Mr. Brewster has been out of contact long before that. We mentioned this claimed threat to the local authorities here on the 28th as well, since any potential threat of any form should not be taken lightly. They said that this was the first time they heard of it, from us.

Danny claims this alleged threat also caused him to decide to transfer the company to an administrator for restructuring or liquidation. Despite considering this before leaving, as he said to us, he only settled on it after said threat. On the 31st, we sent him a demand letter requesting he returns and give explanations regarding his absence in the face of dire problems with the company, and the brand decomposing each day he is away and the company is unfunded. The deadline expired on 18:30 Cyprus time, April the 2nd, Wednesday.

He posted his reply on the morning of the same day, causing an outrage of the personnel and management that were in the office, still waiting for any sort of coherent response and a way forward. No documentation regarding the bitcoins he supposedly has accounted, has reached the personnel of the company, despite the numerous demands from us, and claims from him that they “are all accounted for”.

Claiming that the threats may have originated within the company is simply adding insult to injury. The people that worked ceaselessly and tirelessly over long hours and weekends, the same people that said they would go unpaid for months when he said he had no more bitcoins, the same people that tried to save his brand, willingly working for an increasingly unlikely wage while he was away, were suspect for threats in his books. For all of the above reasons, upon reading his last response, everyone in the company filed our resignations to be forwarded to the local Registrar of Companies, in absence of the CEO.

A recommendation to halt trading was sent to Mr. Brewster on the 27th. The recommendation was sent to hinder any insider trading activity, considering that it was unlikely that the information about the financial situation of the company could be contained, if he remained in hiding. We were not contacted before trading reinitiated on Havelock on the 4th.

Mr. Brewster has personally sold bitcoins to local Cypriots and staff, and remained the personal custodian of these bitcoins. These bitcoins are now unaccounted for, and the management team was left to face these creditors who we didn’t even know had bought bitcoins from Mr. Brewster. We invite any more that have a documented sale of bitcoins from Mr. Brewster and placed under his custody, to present said evidence to the authorities.

Also, contrary to Mr. Brewster’s claims that he left the island with none of the company’s money, he did in fact and still does hold the company’s remaining 140 Bitcoins (if that’s what’s left).The 140 BTC were never delivered to cover any debt or running expenses despite him being asked and confirming this verbally to all present. His claim later on, was that his lawyer had advised him not to send the coins. To this day we can only assume he is still in possession of these remaining coins.

He is also in possession of personal bitcoins of two employees (~50 bitcoins), as well as at least the bitcoins of multiple other people who bought from him as mentioned above, and entrusted their coins to him for safekeeping. While we now know that one of his cars has changed owners Mercedes and the Bentley is in a car dealer with other plates (probably sold as well), he has remained silent, despite having clearly said that potential funds from selling the cars would go to paying salaries and creditors.

Which brings us here. We will remain in contact with the community and authorities to clear this situation out to its full extent. This was the doing of one person in full control of a business’ funds, not technology and certainly not Bitcoin’s. What we face, is in its core, a corporate governance failure, pervasive in conventional businesses even more often than it is in Bitcoin businesses. Contrary to conventional businesses, where regulation is the only response, the tools are available here, to ensure in the future that these things don’t happen.

personalfinance,"45F divorced, starting over","I'm wondering what is the best thing to do with what little I have left after getting cleaned out in a divorce a few years ago.

-- 45, no children
-- own my own business, making about 35k/yr net
-- 30K in debt, mostly in low interest CCs (0-7%), paying off 2k/month in a snowball fashion.  
-- have a paltry 15K left in savings, currently in a Roth IRA, contributing 166/mo.  I consider this my emergency fund.
-- remaining income strictly budgeted to cover living expenses.  I live frugally.
-- may move in with bf at some point, but this would not radically change my goals, income, or expenses.

In the next year I am going to have more money available as debts get paid off, and I might even have more income if my plans to tweak my business are successful.

My first financial goal is to re-establish a reasonable retirement savings.  I plan to work full time until at least 65, and then part time until at least 70.  I love LOVE love my job and it's not physically taxing, so I may work as long as I can. However, my income does not tend to go up each year -- in fact it has gone down in the last 3-4 years.  I work in healthcare, and insurances pay less and less, with more and more paperwork required, for what I do.  I can't rely on my income going up much over time, but I can rely on job security.

Once that $2,000 currently going toward debt is freed up, how much should I contribute to savings, and where should I invest or save?  Even when I had more money in the Roth IRA, it had been doing poorly since about 2009.  It's well diversified in moderately high risk investments, but it's still functionally equivalent to cash stuffed in a mattress lately.  I'm discouraged about the whole investment thing, but admit I have only a basic understanding.  You need to have money to make money, and I don't have much.  Are there other good options for someone at my income/savings level?

My second goal is to cease living like I'm at poverty level, at some point.  I'm cool with it for now, but pretty soon I'd like to be able to take a vacation once in a while, go do some new things.  Life is short -- I want to be wise with money but still have some fun, or save for some special purchases.  I already have housing and car figured out, happy with those arrangements in my current budget.  What proportion or part of my excess money would be reasonable to carve out for myself, and when should I start doing that?  How or where should I save ""mad"" money?

I don't aspire to amass wealth, I just want to provide for myself and enjoy life.

Maybe this seems simple to answer, but every time I try to think it through, I end up just leaving everything like it is and putting the planning off. Yet I know that having a plan is important.

Bitcoin,The first Chicago Cafe to accept bitcoins needs your support!,"www.cassavachicago.com open today until 8 pm!

3338 N Clark Street
Chicago IL, 60657

To my knowledge this is the only storefront business in Chicago to accept bitcoins and they could use a show of support for being willing to give it a try. I ask any bitcoin users to come by anytime today and make a small purchase to show their appreciation and desire to see businesses accept this cryto-currency in Chicago. Considering what a technologically progressive city we can be if others lead let's help make a difference.

They make excellent healthy smoothies, tasty gluten free empanadas (with grass fed beef), and decent lattes.

They are located just north of belmont on clark not too far from Wrigley field near the addison red line.

Bitcoin will only thrive with the support of it's users (or A.I. tor bots but let's not get into that now lol) so can you guys drop by and give a few mbtc to show you want bitcoin businesses in Chicago?

Thanks in advance for helping make a difference guys. Hit me up here if you want to meet up and discuss bitcoins or any high tech news I'll be in the area most of the day and at night hitting up the bars.",cryptocurrency,1397834706
personalfinance,Dumb Question: Citibank - Paying down interest free balance while continuing to use the card.,"Here is the basic situation with a Citicard:

I have $1000 dollars that I am paying down by $200 every month. It is interest free until June 2015.

I am planning on making $500 worth of purchases this month on the same card. This will be at regular interest rates.

If I pay the credit card company back the entire $500 I spent by the end of the billing cycle, where will the payment be applied?

Will it go towards my 0% interest balance or my regular rate purchases? I don't want to screw up my 0% interest.

I hope I didn't phrase it in a confusing way.",finance,1397836296
personalfinance,What happens if a credit card gets returned to sender?,"I've been lurking and working on my credit score for several years now in anticipation of buying a house next year.

I (stupidly) accepted an offer over the phone from my credit union a few minutes ago for a new credit card. The card had no credit check to get (mainly due to the fact that I just paid off a significant $5k balance to them on a loan and am a good member), a 8.99% interest rate (not that it matters, as I pay my balance in full when due), a $5500 balance and no annual fees or balance transfer fees etc. 

In short, after I told my wife, she doesn't want us to have the card, as between the two of us we have several accounts open already. I also didn't think of the fact that it'll lower my avg age of accounts significantly, but that may not really matter that much as I consolidated several student loans at the beginning of this year so the damage from having new accounts is already done and nothing will make it better except time.

At my wife's request, I called back in to see if they'd processed the ""application"". Sadly, they already sent it off a few minutes before. Obviously, my two choices were just keep the card or cancel it when it comes in (which is a big no). However, she did mention it was being sent to my old address (where my parents still live). So, I asked her what would happen if it got returned to sender as I no longer receive mail at that address. She said it would get returned to them, they'd destroy the information, remove the account (though not ""cancel"" it) and that would be the end of it and it would be as if nothing ever happened. 

My question to /r/pf is is this true? It's a pretty unique experience and I didn't know if anyone had any insight as to what happens or what recourse I have to ""not accept"" the card, especially since they didn't run a credit check and i didn't fill out any sort of application.

**TL;DR - Verbally accepted a credit offer w/ no credit check or application over the phone from my credit union. Wife doesn't want us to have it. It's being sent to an address at which I no longer reside. What happens if it gets returned to sender?**",finance,1397840881
personalfinance,"New job, big plans. Would appreciate your thoughts (warning: wall of text).","Vitals:

* Age - 24
* Industry - technology / big data / start ups
* Location - Boston, MA
* Old job comp/benefits: $65,000 + health, dental + vested .0078% options (I could exercise these any time in the next two months, but I haven't yet)
* New job comp/benefits: $70,000 + 401k (no matching) + health, dental + 7.5% bonus on base salary per year

So - I've just accepted a new job. I knew it wouldn't be particularly impossible to find a job given the need for people in my field/region. I work in the high tech industry in Boston/Cambridge, MA. 

I quit my job of nearly three years on the first of April, officially ending on April 16. It was a small start up with no 401k - just health and dental. This all being said, I didn't have a position lined up. To make a long story short, I found a company that had a position perfect for me, given my previous role. Reached out, and they've offered me the job and I've accepted.

Now let's get closer to my question. 

Lifestyle was tough in my start up. Due primarily to expenses. I often waited longer than the billing period in order to recoup things like fights for the company. This meant I often used savings to cover work expenses so as to avoid taking on interest or potentially hurting my credit if I allowed things to carry for too long. So that sucked. No matter what I did there, it never got better - so I left. The new job has a real policy, and will get expenses back to me next direct deposit. Even if it ends up being the deposit after next, that still beats my old gig in spades. I will still be traveling a good bit. It does seem like I have access to a travel agent, so not all expenses will be mine to carry, but some. And for the expenses I do pick up, it's a nice little boost to my credit card miles (so long as they get paid tidily, and I think they will). 

So first off, I'll be making a larger dent in savings with the extra $5000 in salary, but after taxes and amortized that won't be too huge (then again math suggests that'll be about $300 higher in each paycheck, so.......). 

But really I want to figure out 401k vs. overpaying my student loans! Since the company doesn't match, I suspect it is worthwhile considering overpaying my student loans. 

Here are the vitals on my student loans:

* $14k @ 8.29%
* $13k @ 3.25% (variable)
* $15k @ 8.89%
* $7k @ 7.65%
* $21k @ 6.55% (this is dept. of ed. loans that I've bulked into one interest rate, there's actually six loans here, some @ 5.25%, some at 6.8%; some are subsidized interested, some are not)

So that's about $70k I owe. I figure it's prudent to overpay the &gt;8% interest loans immediately, with the money I'd otherwise be putting into my 401k without matching. I can't see anything better than a certain 8.89% return, right?

-----
TLDR: Should I bother contributing to my new job's 401k at all (they don't match til 2015 at the earliest)? I have student loans from 5%-8.8% with a total debt of about $70k. Shouldn't I just overpay my highest interest rate student loans with the money I would have otherwise put towards the 401k? If I get my debt out of the way sooner, I think I would be happier, even if I lose a bit of the early start on my retirement funds.",finance,1397845555

personalfinance,Credit union vs. big bank?,"I know this has probably been asked many times before, but I was wondering what are the main benefits/downsides of banking with a credit union vs. a big bank. I'm only starting to really try to get a grasp of personal finance, so bear with me.

Me: 27, about to recently graduate and start a new middle-class job, presently and in near future sharing apartment with roommates, so I won't have too much in the way of normal expenses besides food, rent, utilities, etc. I'm looking to put a large part of my income into savings.

Up until last year my bank was a credit union in San Diego, but since moving to Arizona I have wanted to switch banks due to having local and easier access to customer service. I recently just opened a Chase Checking and Freedom Card, mostly for the sign-up bonus ($125 for checking and $125 for card after purchases), but looking at the APY rates they are pretty dismal. Do credit unions usually have better interest rates?

Also, I've heard a lot about how credit unions have better customer service/appreciation, but my dealings with Chase (both person and phone) have never been bad. Are there any other advantages to banking with a credit union?

Last, what is your opinion of online banks like Ally, Capitcal One 360? Their interest rates seem much higher than traditional banks, which is what interests me. What are some things I should look out for in online banks?

Round out the week with your news summary from Money &amp; Tech:

Former Neo &amp; Bee employees took to Reddit today to set the record straight ""regarding the mistruths and outright lies being fed to investors, creditors and the public."" In their statement, the employees describe how the entire management team was misled by CEO Danny Brewster about the loss of several thousand of the company's bitcoins, who ignored their multiple requests for financial transparency. The statement goes on to detail how Brewster left Cyprus in possession of the remaining bitcoins, cutting all contact and abruptly deciding ""to transfer the company to an administrator for restructuring or liquidation,"" leaving his underpaid employees to face creditors.  Neo &amp; Bee's employees have now all formally resigned and are working with authorities to resolve the situation. 

Reports began surfacing Thursday of some LocalBitcoin wallets losing funds and transactions being delayed. The Finland-based company responded with a blog statement describing the problem as likely due to a malware attack, as opposed to ""a security flaw on the website itself."" The statement also assured users that the number of affected accounts is very low, and that it will be minimizing cold storage movements while it addresses the issue.

Coinomat.com now offers the ability to transfer Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Peercoin to VISA and Mastercards issued by any bank worldwide, with few exceptions.  The new service hopes to aid customers experiencing difficulties with cryptocurrency conversion due to banking restrictions and the absence of local exchange services.

Emerging cryptocurrency BlackCoin has made two exciting announcements. First, it's launching a debit-style BlackCoin Card this May, making it easier to securely spend the alt currency. And second, it will be integrated into the CoinKite web wallet system, to expand the coins reach. 

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has decided to accept bitcoin campaign donations in his bit for the Texas Governorship. Abbott hopes this will help him quote """"reach more Texans than any previous campaign in the state.” The Governor-hopeful expressed his enthusiasm in a statement Thursday, saying that “The spirit of Bitcoin embodies the free market principles that make Texas a leader in innovation and entrepreneurship.”

personalfinance,"22-Year- Old, what should a smart financial goal be now?","I graduated college last summer and have been working at a consulting/professional services firm for the past 8 months. I recently paid off about half of my student debt from my checking but I still have a sizable amount of money in my account. Now I am wondering if I should put a good amount of it into my Roth, up my 401(K) contribution, pay off most if not all of my student loans or save up for a down-payment for a home. 

I don't have any credit card debt so that won't be a factor. For buying a home, I like my job and my city and can see myself staying for at least 3 more years. My parents have also said they would help me with down-payment if I find a place. With rent prices going up a lot (I already pay $1,300 a month), interest rates pretty low now and being able to deduct mortgage interest, I was leaning towards this. 

With interest rates in the gutter now, I really don't want to put money into a savings (even online savings are only at ~0.9%). I didn't put too much into my retirement accounts because my company gives me both a 401 (K) match and a pension but everyone keeps telling me I should max out my 401(K) and my Roth before paying off my student debt or buy a home.


My financials:

* Annual pay - ~$65,000
* Student debt - ~$8,400 at $3.4% interest
* Roth IRA - ~$1,800
* 401(K) - ~$4,500 (employer match 6% of salary with 4%)
* Company Pension - 15% of salary a year
* Checking account - $12,500
* Monthly savings after all expenses - ~$900

personalfinance,Buy a house or rent with a term job?,"Background:

Wife and I are both ~30.  We have ~100k in assets between retirement accounts and liquid savings.  No debt at all.  Combined income is $160k.  We're in an expensive metro area and currently pay $1750 in rent for an ok place.  Excellent credit.  We'd be looking at a place with a mortgage around $2200/month.  

The wrinkle: both our jobs are probationary (government).  We have two years terms, at which point they can cut us loose, re-up for another two years (max of four total) or sign us up for a permanent position.  Permanent more or less means you're golden forever, and getting the term position is the usually limiting step. That said, it's certainly possible that one or the other of us wouldn't get it (especially if we get another binge of cut cutting in government).  They usually let you know six months or more in advance, but it's not so easy finding jobs in our highly specialized field.  

The incentive to buy is mostly concerned about interest rates rising in the future, but also the rent/own disparity in this area is becoming distressing.  We're spending $1750/month on a place I could own for $1200/month, and this is market value here.  We're also not really fond of the town we're living in, but it's not worth moving and still renting.

dogecoin,Cryptocurrencies not so decentralized ...,"Look, First off, I am no expert whatsoever just a random guy that wants to share his way of thinking... 

Let's start of by saying, yes, I realize ASICS are the way of the future, in order for us to keep the networks going, these will have to become an integral part of it... However, I also do kinda feel , if you think about it, that with the way crypto's are designed in the original form(mining with GPU's) is that unlike fiat currencies, where the central bank or rather banks control the currency, it has been spread towards every one, so that everyone can grab a slice of the pie, instead of it being in the government's control.

So now everyone can mine and everyone can get a bit of coins for themselves, but now with the large ASICS coming in to play, we once again have it, that the only people that can stay ahead of the game, is either Bitcoin whales or people that started mining when bitcoin came out originally, or poeple with alot of money to invest or then to the most extreme large corporations or maybe even banks if they felt so inclined to invest in large mining farms.

Effectively leaving the control of the currencies in a small groups control once again. 
And I got to be honest, this kind of sucks for the little guy, coz unless you have money , you cant't even think about staying in mining for longer than a couple of months... So it might be decentralized in the sense that no one is control (per say), by being able to introduce interest rates and so forth, but lets say,the couple of people that own the most DOGE coin for instance come together (according to this, there are 8 people that control 36% of all doge) http://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-dogecoin-addresses.html

If these 8 people were to contact each other, they could effectively make the currency go the way they want it to.
They could buy more, thus increasing the price, or dump millions onto exchanges to make sure the price drops. 

Even though the whole concept of crypto currencies is that it is decentralized, which it is, it still doesn't meant that only a handful of people can be in control at any given time...

I'm not saying it is happening, but it could very well, so thats why I am very much against ASIC's, because it kinda robs the little guy to be part of something great once again... Look, you can just be part of this community by buying in, or mining like I am with my normal gaming pc, but it just feels that as ASICS get more and more powerful, the power of the currency gets more and more concentrated in the hands of the people who are at the top...

Seems good. Just [one thing appearing to be... scamy enought to start suspecting QoinPro](http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/17/92/99/13/qoinpr12.png).

To add a new coin to your balance (and then start receiving few of it everyday), [you need QoinPro Credits. How much? 10 CREDITS](http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/17/92/99/13/qoinpr11.png).

And how would you get 10 CREDITS? By SMS. And it costs 1€/10crd. An average of Ð2,000.

You would think that it worths it... but let me tell you a short story.

**wow experiance**

1. I registred on QoinPro on feb. 23rd 2014.

2. I got 4 referrals to gain 10% more than at the beginning.

3. We are now on apr. 19th. I remembered that I had some coins on QoinPro and wanted to withdraw them to Cryptsy and then turn them into DogeCoins as I'm digging DOGE.

**So here is for you [my balances after all this time and all the withdrawals that failed to work](http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/17/92/99/13/qoinpr10.png).**

You can see that for everycoin, and for two months membership, I merely earned 12% of the ""minimum transaction fee"", and merely 9% of the ""minimum withdrawal amount"".

**WOW**

So I have to wait 20 months to start withdrawing!

Bitcoin,Bitcoin is a Counterrevolution ... It is NOT a Revolution,"Revolution defined

a radical and pervasive change in society and the social structure, especially one made suddenly and often accompanied by violence. 

a sudden, complete or marked change in something

Counterrevolution

a political movement that resists revolutionary tendencies.

a revolution whose aim is the deposition and reversal of a political or social system set up by a previous revolution.


It is very important that the Bitcoin community understand the history behind currencies.  Fiat currency in its current form is revolutionary!  The Federal Reserve can print US dollars at anytime.  

As a result, they can print dollars to destroy the national sovereignty of any country that threatens its dominance.  Libya, Iraq, Iran, Ukraine, Syria, etc, etc 

The revolutionary federal reserve system also uses the World Bank and IMF to destabilise countries with usury loans which the host country cannot possibly pay back.  Think of Jamaica, Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, numerous African countries, numerous Latin American countries, etc etc etc


BITCOIN IS COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY!!

It will bring stability to nations large and small.

It will stop the proliferation of warfare backed by Fiat printing.

The currency will have value...... And will increase in value.  Savers will benefit.  Excessive risk takers will not be rewarded.

Small countries will protect their wealth because they will not have to protect Bitcoin like Gold.  Think of Libya - Where is their 200-400 tons of Gold?  


In conclusion, the last 50 - 100 years of Fiat currency is the revolution!  We are attempting to be the counterrevolution!  We must use the right terms or we can become pawns to the emotional winds of revolution.  A counterrevolution is rational and stable.  I am part of the Bitcoin community because I want the world to be stable and rational.",cryptocurrency,1397965992

personalfinance,What about renting out my car? I'd love some thoughts.,"Long time subscriber, first time poster.  Wondering if I an get some thoughts on a situation I have.

Background Info:  My wife and I both have 2014 cars (Ford Fusion SE, and Nissan Altima SV). I financed a total of $27,219.56 [after trade-ins which were free and clear] including service plans for the next 6 years/120,000 and bumper-to-bumper coverage for the same time period/mileage.  The interest rate on both is .9%.  The total monthly payment is $382.09, which is fine by me.  We plan on owning these cars for the next 10 years or so, and I typically make double payments each month. 

Current Info:  Beginning on July 1, 2014 and ending on July 1, 2015, I will not need to drive at all (Ford Fusion).  So instead of the car just sitting there, I am wondering if I can do something with it.  Given the low interest rate and the awesome deal I got on it, I don't want to get rid of it only to have to buy a new car in another year as it would not be worth the time/effort/money/tax/registration fees.

Question:  Has anyone looked into renting out their car?  I realize the insurance will need to be modified to reflect this (and in fact, may not make it worthwhile to rent out depending on how much it costs), but I am wondering if there are outlets for someone in my situation?  We are not hard up for money (12 month emergency fund, fully funded IRAs, and 401K contributions are all accounted for), but I hate the idea of the car just sitting.

Any thoughts would be great!

Edit:  Changed their to there, AND I am in the NJ/NYC/Philly area.

Edit 2:  Thanks for the feedback, folks.  Just to briefly highlight I was merely curious if anyone had experience with the situation.  My natural tendency is not to do it, but there was a lot of great advice and conversation, thank you! Have a great evening!",finance,1398006786
personalfinance,Do any (free) weekly pay budget sheets exist?,"Hi there, I preemptively apologize for the long post!

I LOVE the [Personal Finance Budget in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1owkv3/heres_my_budgetdebt_tracking_spreadsheet_i_spent/), however my pay is weekly and I can't just combine into biweekly without running into issues. My new laptop did not come with Excel, so I don't plan on buying it unless I have to (I use it enough at work!); Google Drive is my primary spreadsheet program for personal use.

I figure before I spend time to adapt that sheet (add the columns, etc....only to reformat the Debt section, and any Month to Month formulas) I would check in with the subreddit and see if maybe you have any recommendations? YNAB free trial was suggested, but I'd prefer free overall. If you can justify my spending on that to track, feel free to convince me! I have no experience with that program yet.

I get paid every Friday, so I currently use a Bills By Paycheck sheet I created in Drive which includes this basic info:

* Paycheck Date
* Bill
* Amount Due
* Date Due
* Calculated Total of Bills Due For Week
* Paycheck Amount
* Money Left - and this carries over to an Extra From Prior Week section within the next week's section (to calculate a new Money Left amount).

I fill in any other ""random"" expenses as I go (groceries, gas, etc.) within that date range, kept as real-time as possible. This has been extremely helpful since last fall, so I can see where my money goes and how it affects my future bills. It helps me plan ahead and see how much I really have to spend without affecting my bill payments or overdrafting my account, while also planning for major purchases.

That being said, I'd really like to take it to the next level and create a budget for so many categories. I currently do not have a ""Month To Month"" visual to evaluate my spending and I know those uncategorized purchases will be the key to cut back on my expenses and pay more towards my debt. In other words, I track my bills but do not allocate specific budgets for Gas, Food, Household Items, Health &amp; Beauty, Entertainment, etc. but rather fill them into my tracking sheet as the money is spent.

I am willing to look back at bank statements, see exactly what I have spent in certain categories and update that way...but the issue is moving forward with a better system in place. If you're interested in me posting my current expenses/pay to address this, I can.

Within my current workbook, I have a separate sheet with my current debt, divided into Student Loans and Credit Cards. They are listed with:

* Current Payment (I know which I'm currently ""Avalanching"")
* Total Balance
* Interest Rate
* Credit Limit (as applicable)

Both the Credit Cards and Student Loans sum a Total Debt, and I decided as of Dec. 2013 I'd tabulate my Total Debt overall so I could get some sort of gratification per year as I pay it all down. As it is, I've paid down two credit cards within 1Q 2014.

Edit: I'm doing the debt avalanche, not snowball! Go away high interest!

**TL;DR - So before I venture into creating my own adaptation of what is available for biweekly budgets, any help/recommendations would be much appreciated for a weekly pay budget with month to month tracking. Thanks!**",finance,1398006806

There were the typical factions, including not-star-trek federation, and ambiguously not-Klingon war species in their green warships.

You played a solo pilot and flew around collecting cash, transporting colonies for your faction, and shooting stuff up. If you were good, you could buy bigger, badder ships.

There were space stations, colonies, planets, stars, and a general mess of stuff to explore.

Strategy &amp; Path Forward: 

-	Home

     o    Critical to enjoyment of life is to enjoy housing. We could find 1200 apt without giving up townhome + attached garage and feeling safe at home. Other possible place was 900 a month but didn’t meet ‘do I feel safe’ sanity check…

     o    Looking to buy house as soon as possible.  Using savings w/ $1000 a month input for house down-payment fund (~4 more years to hit target 50k w/10k buffer left)

     o	Moving to cut rent from 1400 to 1200 (actually 1450-&gt;1200 if you include rent increase that would otherwise occur). 



-	Pay student loans off as soon as possible

     o	Goal is $2500 a month which will put us at 6yrs per a payment calculator

       	Currently sitting at $2000 /month payment (8yrs)


-	Budgeting

    o	We use mint.com and are fairly good at sticking to prescribed budget


Worries:

o	Fearing by the time we have 20% down-payment (~50k, ~4 years), the market won’t be as friendly. Have been considering options of less % down-payments to secure lower interest but haven’t worked through math yet… Might not actually work out how I think it might.


Fishing for advice: 

   -	Using savings account vs Vanguard ETF (or another investment vehicle) for house down-payment fund for ~4 year turnaround (balancing liquidity vs increased ROI and market flux)
   -	Does our budget seem reasonable in all areas? Where can we improve? Is there a standard budget split into categories by % income?
   -	Is 20% down-payment recommended vs going lower and getting into market sooner?
   -	Trading paying min on student loans and putting rest in market vs paying as much as possible until we burn through interest rates 5% and up (right before we get to the large sum loans). Looking at the numbers, I’d ballpark about 3 years of paying $1000 extra on loans vs putting that $1000 towards house fund. What does a neutral 3rd party think?",finance,1398020067

I am not sure where I will get a job after college, so an online bank seemed like a good idea. I will probably use whatever account I make now as my primary checking and savings for at least for the next 2 years. I also have about $1500 in a TD checking account in case I need a lot of cash for an apartment deposit, etc.

Ally: From everything I've read 50% seem to think it's great, and the other 50% think it's the devil incarnate. I've also read the mobile app is great, or the mobile app is really slow. 


Bank x: Originally I was going to make an account here because they were recommended by a friend. However, the lack of reviews/search results made me rethink. 


Bank of the Internet: Apparently the parent company to Bank X.


Schwab: I've heard that it is better Ally service wise, though it has slightly lower interest rates.

*I just got a 5% raise (my take home will now be $1515. Do I add the 5% into my company 401K or should I open a ROTH IRA and begin funding that? I cannot open a regular IRA because we filed separately last year. I honestly do not anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, I think my earning potential has reached its cap  OR should we take that additional amount $85.00 a month and pay down student loan debt or Dr. Bills?

*What is the benefit of opening an IRA when you have a company 401K anyway?

*Are we too far behind, is it feasible for us to catch up?

*We have a ton of long overdue home improvement projects we are also saving for (furnace, water softener, floor, windows, siding, painting, ECT). We also need to tackle these along with saving for retirement

*I know the student loans are at a higher interest rate but I am scared to scale back funding our retirement to pay those down.

* Is there hope?

news,Ameriprise Financial Abney Associates Team: Estimating your retirement income needs,"You know how important it is to plan for your retirement, but where do you begin? One of your first steps should be to estimate how much income you'll need to fund your retirement, [Abney Associates Team A financial advisory practice of Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc.](http://ameripriseabneyassociates.wordpress.com/). That's not as easy as it sounds, because [retirement planning](http://sqworl.com/42afe5) is not an exact science. Your specific needs depend on your goals and many other factors.

[USE YOUR CURRENT INCOME AS A STARTING POINT](http://www.ameripriseadvisors.com/team/abney-associates/articles/19/estimating-your-retirement-income-needs/)

It's common to discuss desired annual retirement income as a percentage of your current income. Depending on who you're talking to, that percentage could be anywhere from 60 to 90 percent, or even more. 

The problem with this approach is that it doesn't account for your specific situation. If you intend to travel extensively in retirement, for example, you might easily need 100 percent (or more) of your current income to get by. 

[PROJECT YOUR RETIREMENT EXPENSES](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1117596)

Your annual income during retirement should be enough (or more than enough) to meet your retirement expenses. That's why estimating those expenses is a big piece of the retirement planning puzzle. But you may have a hard time identifying all of your expenses and projecting how much you'll be spending in each area, especially if retirement is still far off. To help you get started, here are some common retirement expenses:

-	Food and clothing

-	Housing: Rent or mortgage payments, property taxes, homeowners insurance, property upkeep and repairs

-	Utilities: Gas, electric, water, telephone, cable TV

-	Transportation: Car payments, auto insurance, gas, maintenance and repairs, public transportation

-	Insurance: Medical, dental, life, disability, long-term care

-	Health-care costs not covered by insurance: Deductibles, co-payments, prescription drugs

-	Taxes: Federal and state income tax, capital gains tax

-	Debts: Personal loans, business loans, credit card payments

-	Education: Children's or grandchildren's college expenses

-	Gifts: Charitable and personal

-	Savings and investments: Contributions to IRAs, annuities, and other investment accounts

-	Recreation: Travel, dining out, hobbies, leisure activities

-	Care for yourself, your parents, or others: Costs for a nursing home, home health aide, or other type of assisted living

-	Miscellaneous: Personal grooming, pets, club memberships

Don't forget that the cost of living will go up over time. The average annual rate of inflation over the past 20 years has been approximately 2.4 percent. (Source: Consumer price index (CPI-U) data published by the U.S. Department of Labor, 2012.) And keep in mind that your retirement expenses may change from year to year. For example, you may pay off your home mortgage or your children's education early in retirement. Other expenses, such as health care and insurance, may increase as you age. To protect against these variables, build a comfortable cushion into your estimates (it's always best to be conservative). Finally, have a financial professional help you with your estimates to make sure they're as accurate and realistic as possible.

[DECIDE WHEN YOU'LL RETIRE](http://acworth.patch.com/groups/ameriprise-abney-associates/p/ameriprise-financial-abney-associates-team-abcs-of-financial-aid)

[Financial Advisory Abney Associates](http://ameripriseabneyassociates.quora.com/) to determine your total retirement needs, you can't just estimate how much annual income you need. You also have to estimate how long you'll be retired. Why? The longer your retirement, the more years of income you'll need to fund it. The length of your retirement will depend partly on when you plan to retire. This important decision typically revolves around your personal goals and financial situation. For example, you may see yourself retiring at 50 to get the most out of your retirement. Maybe a booming stock market or a generous early retirement package will make that possible. Although it's great to have the flexibility to choose when you'll retire, it's important to remember that retiring at 50 will end up costing you a lot more than retiring at 65.

[ESTIMATE YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY](http://ameripriseassociates.booklikes.com/)

The age at which you retire isn't the only factor that determines how long you'll be retired. The other important factor is your lifespan. We all hope to live to an old age, but a longer life means that you'll have even more years of retirement to fund. You may even run the risk of outliving your savings and other income sources. To guard against that risk, you'll need to estimate your life expectancy. You can use government statistics, life insurance tables, or a life expectancy calculator to get a reasonable estimate of how long you'll live. Experts base these estimates on your age, gender, race, health, lifestyle, occupation, and family history. But remember, these are just estimates. There's no way to predict how long you'll actually live, but with life expectancies on the rise, it's probably best to assume you'll live longer than you expect.

**IDENTIFY YOUR SOURCES OF RETIREMENT INCOME**

Once you have an idea of your retirement income needs, your next step is to assess how prepared you are to meet those needs. In other words, what sources of retirement income will be available to you? Your employer may offer a traditional pension that will pay you monthly benefits. In addition, you can likely count on Social Security to provide a portion of your retirement income. To get an estimate of your Social Security benefits, visit the Social Security Administration website (www.ssa.gov) and order a copy of your statement. Additional sources of retirement income may include a 401(k) or other retirement plan, IRAs, annuities, and other investments. The amount of income you receive from those sources will depend on the amount you invest, the rate of investment return, and other factors. Finally, if you plan to work during retirement, your job earnings will be another source of income.

**MAKE UP ANY INCOME SHORTFALL**

If you're lucky, your expected income sources will be more than enough to fund even a lengthy retirement. But what if it looks like you'll come up short? Don't panic--there are probably steps that you can take to bridge the gap. A financial professional can help you figure out the best ways to do that, but here are a few suggestions:

-	Try to cut current expenses so you'll have more money to save for retirement

-	Shift your assets to investments that have the potential to substantially outpace inflation (but keep in mind that investments that offer higher potential returns may involve greater risk of loss)

-	Lower your expectations for retirement so you won't need as much money (no beach house on the Riviera, for example)

-	Work part-time during retirement for extra income

-	Consider delaying your retirement for a few years (or longer)

personalfinance,Private student loans and bankruptcy - can it be done?,"Backstory:

My cousin has asshole parents. They forced him to take out private loans (i.e., Bank of America) since federal student loans wouldn't cover his full tuition amount at his private liberal arts college. 

Now he is in graduate school with zero job prospects at the moment, and his private loans become due the moment school ends - there is no grace period. He is making barely enough to pay rent while in school, and definitely doesn't have enough to pay $80,000 in loans ($500?/month). 

While this next part is probably his own fault ... His degree is in teaching and he hates it and doesn't want to be a teacher ... He will almost certainly default on those loan payments since his parents won't help him pay. 

The private loans suck and are unable to be deferred due to financial hardship or have the payments adjusted due to income, like the federal student loans. 

So, the big question, if he defaulted long enough and was unable to find employment or got sick or something, and had to file for bankruptcy - would those awful private loans be included? Could they be eliminated?",finance,1398053872

I am originally from Canada and I am not sure how it works in the US, so I came here to find out. I assume that it's not very different; but how would one go about getting rid of a high-interest car loan? My husband just took out a car loan at 15% interest. I was away in Canada for a while visiting relatives and was not aware of this. He had told me he was getting a car but the plan was to get a used car. Since he was new in the state and was unsure of where to look, he just took out a car loan! I am kind of freaking out cause he already has student loans and can't believe he made such a decision. How does it work? In Canada you can get a line of credit for a very loan interest rate (2-3%) if you have really good credit.  Another option would be to get rid of the damn thing and buy a used car. Is it possible to cancel the contract after only a month? What kind of penalties are there for this?

I work as a copywriter in advertising. I've been employed for a year this May. My take home per month is $1909.48. I'm going to have a review in May, and hope to ask for a raise. In the mean time, I'd like to know if there's a better strategy for saving money. I'm generally really cheap - I ride my bike to work, my grandmother pays my phone bill, and I have great health insurance thanks to work. But I don't have a lot of spending money for fun things since my rent takes the bulk of my monthly take home. I tend to spend money on food and drinks with friends - not super often; I generally bring lunch most days of the week and leave my debit card at home. 

My goal is to have at least 3 months rent and living expenses for an emergency fund, to start a retirement fund (probably a Roth IRA), and to put money aside for traveling. I'm finding my goals are unrealistic. What can I do?

personalfinance,23 M with a few questions,"Hi PF

I know that I am in a good position, that being
said I have some questions and I enjoy reading the posts on this
subreddit. I wanted to lay out my situation in detail so that I can
get the best advice possible. No matter how good a position you are in there can always be something new to learn :).

I am 23 years old and have just completed the two year mark at my job.
I recently got a promotion moving from about 65,000 to 84,000. I
graduated from college with $10,000 to my name from work during
college and have been fortunate enough to have my family fund my
college so I am currently debt free and plan to only assume debt for a
house.  Most of the detail in my post is because I want to get another
point of view on my investments and plans to purchase a home. I
currently live out of my parents house rent free while my father works
over seas. My girlfriend and I are planning to stay together for the
long term and she lives about 6 hours away right now. I travel for
work as well, so there is no incentive for me to leave this
arrangement for the next 1.5 years when my GF finishes college.

Questions:

1. What does this sub reddit think of my current investment
allocations? Since expense ratio’s are priced into the performance of
the funds, if they are performing similarly to ETF’s what is my
motivation to switch to ETF’s? I am planning to buy about 3k in a real
estate ETF or mutual fund,  then put about $1500 into my ROTH IRA to
fund it for the first quarter, then start building an emergency fund
with the remaining $2600 I have each month.

I know this sub reddit usually talks about expense ratios being
important, but my understanding is that the expense ratios are built
into the performance of the funds ticker. Based on that, my mutual
funds have performed in line with comparable ETF’s. I plan to keep a
close eye on them and if I notice any significant performance lag I
will switch to ETF’s. The only thing I could see is that, since their
portfolios are less diversified, I am assuming more risk.

When I started investing out of college, we asked my dad’s corporate
provided FA for advice on my investment plan. He has been very
straight forward with me about what he offers. He only provides advice
on mutual fund selection and does not control my money, or offer stock
advice.

2. how do I get my girlfriend to seriously prioritize paying down her
student debt?

My girlfriend is graduating college in 1.5 years and we plan to move
in together at that time. I am planning to buy a condo or a small
house for us to live in if the right opportunity comes along and the
equities market is looking good. Otherwise I plan to rent with her
until we make plans to settle down. I have tried to gauge her debt,
but is it hard because she does not know the exact number and is not
yet ready to face it. Her mom is helping her manage the financing of
her school. I believe it will be in the ballpark of 60k at 6-7%. With
a 6-7% interest rate, I think my girlfriend should be paying every
extra penny into her student loans.

3. How much house can I afford? I think I am in a weird position in
that I will have a much larger down payment than my annual salary
suggests I should have. I am hoping to have about 100-130k in taxable
accounts to fund a down payment on a 300-400k property in 2-5 years. I
think the biggest miss here may be that I am 100% in the market and at
high risk.

personalfinance,My experiences with SoFi &amp; Darien Rowayton student Loan Refi's,"Recently my husband and I refinanced our federal student loans with two different private companies.  I thought I would share the experiences with /r/pf to help out others that might be wanting to take advantage of these options.  If my lessons learned help out at least one other person I will be a happy girl :)


About us:  My husband (MBA) and I (JD) went back to school for professional degrees.  We each attended private universities in a large city.  Hindsight 20/20 maybe we could have chosen a cheaper city or done public schools but we did what we did.  No regrets, we both were able to get excellent jobs that we enjoy.


* **Darien Rowayton Bank**  (www.drbank.com/student)  This is a traditional Bank FDIC insured that offers refi's for most *Graduate* student loans.  

We selected the fixed 15 year option.  


DR Bank had excellent rates.  They did have a high threshold for approval; we had to both be named on this loan as one salary was not enough.  This company took **FOREVER** to get the ball rolling on things once I submitted an application.  It took well over a month to find out initially that we were denied on just 1 income and only after I repeatedly contacted them.  Then it took another month+ for the application to be approved with both incomes included.  Once the approval came, it was still 2 more months before everything was set up and I could make my first payment in March.  

Keep in mind- you get the 0.25% reduction when you open a checking account at DR Bank as the auto-draft account.  Getting the online accounts set up was slightly painful as you either had to bug them for your account info to set it up or wait for the snail mail information (which cut it much too close to the first due date for my liking!)  Setting up the online account information required requesting access then waiting on some employee to approve you.  

Now that everything is set up, things are running smoothly going on 2 months.  I am very happy reducing the loan rates 7.75% ---&gt; 5.75%


* **SoFi**  (sofi.com)  This is a start-up type company by Stanford MBA's back in 2011.  It is a peer-to-peer type set up.  Certain eligibility requirements apply: https://www.sofi.com/refinance-loan-eligibility/  

We selected the 10 year variable loan option.

SoFi impressed the HECK out of us.  Since we were dealing with a traditional bank for around 3 months at this point, the SoFi process seemed even more streamlined and quick.  We submitted information and found out immediately which loan rates and options were available.  Note: each of us submitted information and received different rates.  For one of us SoFi was the better option and for the other DR Bank was the better option as we selected different products to help with our 'snowballing'.

Overall the process took roughly 1 month before everything was set up and we could make payments.  They even sent us some free trail mix from another company, a sofi logo t-shirt and a bottle opener!  The payments are processed by trustudent.com.  I was able to set up the auto draft from our checking account with the initial paper work and the first two payments have gone off perfectly.

One note: They charge you the full % interest rate for the payment without the .25% auto draft deduction.  The interest payment made from the payment is based on the lower .25% less interest rate.  So you pay a tiny bit more in principle each month than you would on a more traditional loan. We are fine with this, but found it pretty odd.  Additionally, you are not able to change your auto draft bank account online- this must be done via snail mail/fax.  The explanation is that it prevents people from accidentally messing up their 0.25% deduction- seems pretty stupid to me... but oh well.


So there you have it, an overview of our experiences with each of these companies.  Hopefully this helps someone out.  It has helped us out by GREATLY reducing our student loan interest.",finance,1398092150

Bitcoin,NEO &amp; BEE: THE FULL PICTURE,"**NEO &amp; BEE: THE FULL PICTURE**

This is a reconstruction of the events that took place from the 17th of March up to the 18th of April 2014, surrounding the collapse of Neo &amp; Bee (N&amp;B). Within one month N&amp;B, initially believed by many to be a promising bitcoin start up, vanished from the surface of the earth with its CEO still being on the hide with an arrest warrant issued for him for serious criminal charges.

The timeline is derived from press reports, N&amp;B announcements, Cypriotic police announcements, posts of Danny Brewster on Reddit and Bitcointalk, the post of N&amp;B management team on Reddit and the subsequent  AMA session, tweets by Brewster, tweets and posts on Reddit by Tuur Demeester and Andreas Antonopoulos, and other publicly available sources.

**September 2013 - February 2014:** Brewster raises, through an IPVO in 3 exchanges, approximately 9,400 BTC for LMB Holdings, a UK “virtual entity”.

**September 2013 - March 2014:** Brewster spends around 4,400 BTC  in setting up N&amp;B in Cyprus amidst one of the most aggressive marketing campaigns ever launched by a bitcoin company, with the motto *""Who is Neo?”*.

On the 24th of February 2014 N&amp;B opens its first branch in Nicosia Cyprus amidst a lot of enthusiasm, with the share price at Havelock almost doubling the IPVO price.

**17th March:** 6 months have passed since the publication of the original LMB Prospectus (September 2013) and even though investors were promised quarterly financial statements (copy from prospectus: *“Quarterly financial statements will be published across all supported platforms where LMB Holdings shares are available to be purchased”*), the company has not published a single financial statement. Investors that inquire about this in Reddit and Bitcointalk as early as December 2013, are always reassured by Brewster (“Cryptocyprus”) that the financial information *“will be out very soon”*.
On March 17th, Brewster tweets that all financial information, projections and appendices *""will be released later this week""*.

**18th March:** Brewster publishes an Updated LMB Prospectus of LMB (v.2.0) against the advice of his management team because, according to a later statement of them, *""a lot of content was incorrect""*.
To the surprise of many, the Updated Prospectus does NOT include any historic financial statements for the first 6 months of operations, nor any financial information or projections. Actually it does not include any “accounting or finance items” whatsoever. In spite of the absence of any finance and accounting numbers, on the same day, Tuur Demeester tweets: *“The Neo &amp; Bee prospectus is teaching us about the future of finance, so important reading!”*.
Apart from the ""incorrect content"", the prospectus includes misrepresentations such as the presentation of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the auditors of the company – copy from Prospectus: *“We are also subjecting ourselves to external auditors for added transparency, we are working with Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC)”*.
The Prospectus refers to an “advisory board” whose only member is Antonopoulos.  The sole member of the Board of Directors is Danny Brewster as no other board members are revealed.

**18th March:** Brewster tells a member of the management team *""we have 5,000 BTC left""*.

As from March 18th, Brewster, an active user of social media with daily presence for months, goes completely silent and absent from Reddit, Bitcointalk, Facebook and Twitter.

**19th March:** The next day Brewster shocks the management team by telling them that the 5,000 BTC have…..overnight become only 140! *""Actually I thought we had 5,000, but I have checked the wallet and the coins are not there, I spent them somewhere but I don't remember on what.......we have only 140 coins left. I am going to the UK to find investors. I will send you the 140 coins left and also sell my Mercedes and Bentley and will send you the money to pay the March salaries and the creditors""*.

**20th March:** Brewster goes to N&amp;B offices for 1 hour. Management team tells Brewster that they want him to step down from CEO. Brewster agrees to step down after transferring control of the company to “investors”, without these investors being identified.

**21st March:** Brewster goes to N&amp;B offices for 1 hour and then disappears and remains out of contact with anybody from the management team.

**21st - 27th March:** The Mercedes is reported sold but the funds from the sale and the 140 N&amp;B coins *""travel""* together with Brewster to the UK, instead of being sent to the management to cover salaries and creditors as promised. The Bentley is reported to be in a car dealership in Nicosia with changed plates, it is unknown whether it has been sold as well with proceeds being taken by Brewster, or whether it is up for sale.

Rumors start spreading on Reddit and Bitcointalk that N&amp;B collapsed and that Brewster ran away with the investors’ coins, leaving behind unpaid employees and around €1M unpaid creditors.

Many members of the bitcoin community, investors etc., reach out to Brewster on social media asking for clarifications.  Brewster is nowhere to be found.

Members of the community post on Reddit and Bitcointalk and tweet Demeester, Antonopoulos and N&amp;B asking what the hell is going on. None of them has a clue and no official announcement is made. Some persons visit the branch and find it closed. Other persons call the company and the reply is *“leave your details and we will call you back”*.

**27th March:** With Brewster into the hide the management notes *""abnormal trading""* on the shares of the company on Havelock and the N&amp;B Compliance Officer sends recommendation to Havelock to stop trading of the shares.

**28th March:** TAT (ThickAsThieves) terminates his contract as pass-through manager for NeoBee shares on Havelock. Havelock suspends trading of NeoBee shares.

Brewster finally makes a contact with the management and says he received a threat for his daughter on the 26th. However, he cannot explain why he disappeared from all social media since the 18th and from the company since the 21st (!). Also strange is the fact that although he claims that the “threat” was for his daughter, he decides that the best course of action is to leave her in Cyprus and him to go into the hide in the UK (!). Brewster says the threats *""have been reported to the relevant authorities""*.

**29th March:** Management team contacts Cypriotic Police asking about the threats against Brewster. Police says this is the first time they heard about it and no reporting of any threats has been made.

**31st March:** With Brewster into the hide, the management sends him a demand letter requesting he returns and give explanations regarding his absence in the face of dire problems with the company

**2nd April:** Brewster posts on Bitcointalk saying staff might be responsible for the threats and that's why he is out of contact with them.

A new shocking assertion comes to light. Even though Brewster publicly and proudly claimed in the last weeks that he did not lose any coins on Mt.Cox as *""the signs were there""*, in his post on Reddit he now claims that he lost coins on Mt.Cox. 
He also claims that *""all bitcoins (raised in the IPVO) are accounted for""*.
Furthermore, he claims that he doesn’t hold any funds/bitcoins that belong to customers:  He writes: *""I would like to reiterate that ZERO customer funds are under my control""* (“capital letters” in ZERO being his emphasis)

**4th April** Trading of NeoBee shares on Havelock restarts without an explanation whether this was done by Havelock deciding on their own or under instructions from Brewster.

**2nd - 15th April:** Brewster’s disappearance continues, all employees resign, the offices and the branch close down, and the N&amp;B brand becomes a joke in Cyprus with the media making derisive and derogatory comments **""Where is Neo?""** (paraphrasing the motto of the marketing campaign ""Who is Neo?"").
Brewster remains on the hide until news break out that an arrest warrant has been issued by the Cypriotic Police. Police says that Brewster is wanted for criminal charges including theft, forgery, counterfeiting and money laundering and for taking customers' and employees' coins and running away

**15th April:** Brewster posts for the second time on Reddit saying that although there is an arrest warrant for serious criminal charges he doesn't plan to return to Cyprus soon because he has to...attend a funeral in the UK (!), and that he can clear out all criminal charges whilst being in the UK. Also, in his post on Reddit, he instructs the Cypriotic Police to...pick up their phones and ....open their emails because he calls and emails them for days, and nobody cares to answer him (!).  He also hints that *“The manner in which the investigations are being carried out are concerning”*, implying that the police might have set him up.
He admits publicly that even though a threat was made against his daughter, he actually left her in Cyprus and he went into hiding in the UK.
Even though on his posting on Bitcointalk on 2 April he reiterated that *“ZERO customer funds are under my control""*, he now admits that he does, in fact, hold the coins of several customers and instructs the customers via the posting on Reddit *“to provide me with their addresses so I can arrange for the bitcoins to be sent to them”*.
In this post a new shocking assertion is now made by Brewster, as he now presents a new excuse for the ""lost coins"". He now claims that he had sold all company coins that were at his disposal on the date Silk Road was busted (2 October 2013) at low prices and that's why he is now insolvent!

**16th April:** Official Spokesman of Cypriotic Police says the investigations against Brewster are *""in an advanced stage""* and does not rule out the issuance of a European or even an International arrest warrant.

**18th April:** Ex-senior N&amp;B management team posts a detailed statement on Reddit saying *""it is appropriate and justified to make the following statement regarding the mistruths and outright lies being fed by Brewster to investors, creditors and the public""*.
Team says that there was never any accountability by Brewster about the money raised in the IPVO, in spite of repeated attempts by CFO and Compliance Officer to extract information from him. Even though Brewster claimed that ""every coin can be accounted for"", the CFO and the management team say that several thousands of coins *""cannot be accounted for""*.
CFO hasn't got a clue about what happened and around 5,000 coins are missing. Brewster said he had them on the 18th but “were lost” on the 19th of March. Later he claimed that they were all sold on 2 October 2013.
Management also reveals that there have never been any financial reports or financial statements that were promised on several occasions by Brewster to the investors (in the original prospectus, in the updated prospectus and in social media).
Management also reveals that in the prospectus issued on March 18th by Brewster against their advice, *""a lot of content was incorrect""* and included misrepresentations such as presenting PricewaterhouseCoopers as the auditors of the company.
Management also reveals that Brewster took away with him customers' as well as employees' coins, even though Brewster claimed that *""ZERO customer funds are under my control""*.

Tuur Demeester posts on Reddit admitting that *“things have taken a dramatic turn for investors and employees with N&amp;B. The gist of it is that CEO Danny Brewster has disappeared, and with him apparently thousands of bitcoins from investors”*.
Andreas Antonopoulos posts on Reddit stating that *“I was as surprised and bewildered by these events…dismayed that another bitcoin company had imploded amidst allegations of fraud and leaving many investors, creditors and employees with serious losses…all of whom betrayed by Danny”*.

N&amp;B has collapsed, with thousands of coins missing and unaccounted for. It is revealed that after 6-7 months of operations the company didn’t manage to come up with any product, had zero revenue, and never produced any type of financial statements.

As has been said in /r/personalfinance again and again, **if you're using your credit card right, it should NEVER matter what your APR is!** You should pay off your statement balance in full on or before your due date. If you do this, it doesn't matter if your APR is 2.1%, 21%, or 21,000%, you'll never pay a dime of interest, you'll never get into debt, and your APR will be, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant.",finance,1398110572

investing,I am a military officer planning to retire in 20 years with an income of 120K per year in today's dollars. Advice requested.,"Hey r/investing,

Mr. Smeeth here and I got a goal that I need a reality check on. Long story short, in 20 years, I intend to retire completely (or at least have the option to pick up and leave the white collar life, go traveling, basket weaving, rutabaga farming, whatever).  The goal is to retire at 43 with the equivalent annual income of $120K in today's dollars.  I plan to accomplish this by meeting half of this amount with a military officer's 20 year pension-approximate value today of $55,000-$60,000.  This means that the remainder of my income should come from dividends totaling about $60,000 (today's dollars). I'm assuming that, through frequent and aggressive investments in the S&amp;P, I can save an estimated 1.4 million dollars, assuming historical interest.  I further intend to use my pension as a “baseline” income that makes me relatively independent on market fluctuations.

Little bit about me:  I am a 23 year old military officer currently saving 1800-2000USD/month on an annual income of 56K for the next two years.  For the 2 years after that, I intend to save close to 2500/month.  For the rest of my military career (years 4-20) I will be saving everything I make over 50K (hopefully) in order to meet this goal.  I am extremely frugal, and my career path ALSO includes phenomenal money saving vehicles called deployments—where I can save up everything I earn over a 6 month period! :)  I am mostly single, and have no children that I am aware of.  I have no debts, and my income will be at 75K in 2 years, 95K in 4 years, and 160 K in 8-10 years.  I have a high risk tolerance at this point. 3K in a Roth tracking the S&amp;P500 through Vanguard. No other assets besides my 10lb head.

I need help.  Please answer questions below, hit me with any questions on any crucial information I may have overlooked, and make me aware of any huge pitfalls or liabilities I may be missing. Questions below.

Q1:  Is this a realistic goal?

 Q2:  I have decided that the S&amp;P 500 will be my primary vehicle for retirement.  I am also maxing out my Roth every year, but because my goal is to retire at 43 and not 59.5, a roth doesn't meet all of my financial needs.  However, with these two vehicles, my neck hairs start to raise at the thought of over 1 million of my hard earned money all in one basket.  Should I diversify?  If so, how and when?

Q3:  If I had, for example, 1.4 million (today) in the S&amp;P, and began to pull of dividends, how much could I expect to earn per annum and what tax rate would I have to pay when I pull the dividends out? (Just 15%, correct?)

Thank you so much in advance for any answers.  I've been self-educating for 5 months on this subject now, and I think it is within the realm of possibility, but the vast majority of my peers seem to think it is either impossible or unreasonable—and I could use some outside advice.",finance,1398128802
personalfinance,I refinanced my car loan with PenFed. Did I save myself money or did I screw myself?,"I originally had my loan through Fifth Thirds bank at 4.72% interest. Decided to shop around and found a better interest rate with PenFed (many PFers recommended them). I had ~$13,045 left on my loan with Fifth Thirds. PenFed just cut me a check for ~13,100 at 2.49% interest. One thing I didn't take into account was the finance charge which is coming out to $696, bringing my total amount to $13,800. I don't remember seeing anything about a finance charge when I signed up, all I saw was that flashy 2.49%.

So my question is, will I be saving money over the length of my loan or is the finance charge going to ruin that? I think I had about 55 payments left with Fifth Third and the new loan term is 48 months. Can someone help me with the math to determine if this was a good decision? I know it's idiotic to ask after I performed the refinance but I guess I just didn't do my due diligence. Any help will be appreciated.",finance,1398131663

**I am** 25 years old and graduated in August 2012 with a BA in Economics and $14k in student loans. I landed a job about a month after graduating as a Mortgage Broker about 2 hours from home. I was basically one of those annoying people that called you over and over after you put your info into Lending Tree. I soon found out I was no salesman, so I asked my manager if there was another position available. They moved me to processing, which I also hated but excelled at, so about three months after that I was promoted to Operations Trainer. This entailed training all new employees and being in charge of a ""class"" of 13 people and taking them through a 3 month mortgage crash course. A dive in interest rates brought along mass layoffs and the closing of the training program. I was offered my old job back as a processor. I took the weekend to think about it, and that same weekend my GF, who I was about to propose to, and I broke up. So I walked in on Monday with my two weeks notice.


**I moved** back home with no plan, but about $2-3K in the bank and $14K in student loans. Since I didn't have a job, I started working part time at a furniture store that a friend of my mother owned until I could find a better job. I wound up becoming rather valuable to them and in 2 months, went from $11/hr to $17.50/hr, was given the title ""warehouse manager"", and was presented with opportunities to make some extra cash ($50-500 a month, just depends on how it goes).


**Fast** forward 7 months to today and I am totally debt free. Just finished paying off my student loans and am moving into my own apartment in June. By the time I move in I should have a $2000 emergency fund built up.

.


**My breakdown will be as follows:**

Income - $36,400/year - $2359/month after taxes (doesn't include bonus)

Rent/Water/Power/Trash - $875/month

Internet - $50/month

Phone - $50/month

Car Insurance - $70/month

Gas - $130

.

That leaves $1184 for food, saving, and living.

.

My only ""assets"" are:

Wells Fargo Checking - $2000

Wells Fargo Rewards Card - $3800 limit, $0 Balance

Barclaycard - $5000 limit, $0 Balance

2006 Nissan Frontier - 71,XXX Miles - Paid Off

**I understand** that my situation is in no way dire and I am very fortunate compared to a lot of redditors on here. I do, however, have a couple things I would like to get advice on from /r/pf:


**1)** My current job does not fulfill me and it does not provide me with career growth. I am basically as high as I can go at this company unless I were to buy it. The only person I answer to is the owner. I don't feel like I am building towards anything. I have learned a good bit and have lost some weight, but I feel like I am treading water. While I am ensured there is room from growth salary wise, I don't think it would ever reach anything that was over $50-60K. On the plus side, it is basically stress free and I essentially get to be my own boss. Am I crazy for being unsatisfied with what I have? Does this job seem like something I should really commit to? Part of me wants to quit my job and go teach English in China for a year.

**2)** Given my current financial situation, what should i do first? My intention is to retire as soon as possible and live off as little as possible. I am very big into the frugal/small footprint movement and plan on building a small home on land when I find where I want to set down roots. I have no desire to ever take out a massive mortgage for a huge house. What would you do with my budget if this was your goal?


**3)** How the hell do you figure out what to do with your life? I feel like I have lived life by going through the motions of what I thought was expected of me. My life feels like it has no passion...no soul. I just can't seem to get past the fact that I am 1 of 7 billion people on this planet, which is one planet of 10 trillion in the milky way, which is only one galaxy of the 100 billions galaxies in the universe. The immensity of reality makes it nearly impossibly for me to give a shit about most of the things our world seems to be blinded by. How do you stay grounded?

Sorry for the rant. After going through this, I am not sure half of this belongs in /r/pf, but you guys always seem to be genuinely help when people reach out here.

personalfinance,"Going to college this fall, need advice for paying (computer science major)","I'm going to university this fall, majoring in computer science.

I'm a bit worried, as my options weren't the greatest as far as aid goes. Here's my situation:

I applied to 6 schools, and I got rejected from three. 

The three to which I was accepted all gave me decent aid packages, but the best option (best aid package and my favorite of the three) gave me ~$36k, roughly 60% of that school's $64000 annual tuition.

In addition, they are offering $4000 for work/study, $3500 direct federal subsidized loan, and $2000 direct federal *un*subsidized loan, totaling at an additional $9500. This would cover roughly 72% of the annual tuition. The rest of the tuition, obviously, must be paid through other means. 

I applied to a number of scholarships, but none of them seem to have panned out. As neither of my parents (divorced) are in particularly great financial situations, this leads me to think that my only other option is paying through student loans, which would end up being around $17500 per year. Multiplied by 4 years, that's a really large amount: $72000. Add to this the federal loans, and that comes out to $92000 at the end of it (thanks to /u/nolancamp2 for pointing this out, by the way). All of this to say, how do I manage this? I have a fairly limited concept of financial management, which leads me to my next point: how do I not make the same financial blunders that my parents made/make? 

I want to be wise with my money, but I have no idea how. I haven't had a true paying job for a while, and I never made consistent money with what I did have, so I don't exactly have much in personal financial experience either. What are some ways to set myself up for being in a good financial position later on? I know this is a vague question, but I'm be happy to elaborate if need be.

Thanks for all of your help.

EDIT: I should have mentioned that I am already committed to this school.
EDIT2: Clarification: the annual tuition, completely, is ~$64000. The aid package is ~$37000, plus loans and work/study equals around ~$46000. Sorry for the confusion.",finance,1398136957

Just the fact you read and post here shows you want to make smart financial decisions and I really respect and appreciate it. You may have stumbled and made mistakes, or maybe you've always been financially savvy, regardless, I wish everyone wanted to be self sufficient.

I just got down voted in a different sub for saying that I hate the excuse ""people can't afford to move out at 22 or even 25 anymore."" I explained I've been on my own since 18, and bought a house at 23 after graduating college and paying off my debt. My boyfriend graduated college a few years before me at 21 and bought a house that year.  It was down vote city for me. I'm 25, own a house, put 18% into retirement, and contribute to to personal savings every month. I understand not all people can afford to live on their own after high school or college, but those living at home in their mid 20s to early 30s should be the exception, not the rule (unless of course it's a cultural reason). 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm tired of hearing excuses in other subs as to why young people can't succeed these days. I read a certain sub and it's all about taking advantage of retail systems, living off your parents or friends, etc. Of course, sometimes there really is great advice on keeping costs low. I thought the sub was about living within your means, but it seems many of those redditors would rather make excuses than take personal responsibility. Below is a compilation of my tips regarding life and college. It's kind of a rant, but also a reality check for some. 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; -If your city is outrageously expensive and you only make 22k a year, why are you living there?! Relocate! 
&lt;p&gt;-If you're living with your parents, please consider the hardship you are placing on them. It's common knowledge a good part the baby boomer generation is not prepared for retirement due to the economy and other factors. Please don't continue to be an expense if you have the ability to support yourself. Sure mom may say she loves having you home, but the reality is she'd probably also like to save on utilities and food. 
&lt;p&gt; -If you have 100k in student debt, get a roommate and stop living the high life that you grew up with. Continue the college lifestyle until you're debt free and have an emergency fund built up. 
&lt;p&gt; -For those pursuing higher learning, please do some research into the field first to make sure your job market is lucrative. Liberal art degrees may perk your interest, but the reality is, these degrees are rarely putting food on the table. Accounting is not my passion in life by any means, but it allows me to pursue the things I truly enjoy. 
&lt;p&gt; -My personal take on student debt is don't take out more loans than your average first year's salary. Pick a cheaper school if you have to, or make it your job to find scholarships. I wanted to go out of state, but I would have had to take out loans galore, so I said no. I still had a blast at my in state school, and paid off my debt shortly after graduation. 
&lt;p&gt; -In addition, there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting a trade rather than a 4 year degree. Plumbers make darn good money. Besides, everyone has a degree these days, that sheet of paper is becoming more and more over rated. 
&lt;p&gt;If you're unemployed, you don't have the right to be picky about jobs, especially straight out of school. Until you've got a written offer, you best keep interviewing whether it's your dream job or not. And if no other offers come along, take the job, use the experience to boost your resume, and continue the job search post graduation. 

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for reading this far. I am just so fed up with a good portion of society feeling entitled to success without putting in the work behind it. I'm tired of being negatively judged for my financial success at a young age. I grew up and overcame my own set of obstacles in life, so I know others can absolutely be just as successful- if not more.

He also knew that the wars would be the most extreme and divisive policies in American history.

And then he went and did the exact opposite of whatever promises he had made - same as Bush did.

When Harry Reid says that the protestors at Bundy Ranch are ""domestic terrorists"" he is lying.

These people aren't terrorists. The reason that Harry Reid is trying to label the people at Bundy Ranch ""domestic terrorists"" is so that the full force of the Police State and the authoritarian laws enacted since 9/11, can be used against peaceful American citizens who are exercising their natural rights to protest, as defined in the United States Constitution.

Harry Reid is lying so that the Patriot Act, the IRS and NSA Surveillance, among other things, can be used against law abiding citizens.

personalfinance,Looking for guidance. Major life changes and unsure where to start to build a secure future.,"Hello everyone,

First post here on /r/personalfinance.

Background:

I'm looking for some guidance on how to set goals and priorities and basically what to do to set myself for a secure near and long term future.

I recently split up with my girlfriend of 8 years.  We lived together and shared all expenses 50/50.  Now with the split I've had to step back and assess my own situation and I don't feel very comfortable.

The Numbers:

I work in a stable job, making a student salary of $30,000 gross.  I will receive a salary of $50,000 - $60,000 gross once I am fully certified which will be by August 2014.

My current monthly income after taxes is $1793.86. Assuming a salary of $50,000, my monthly income will be approximately $2800 come August 2014.

My current expenses include:

Rent $915
Parking $50
Cell Phone $62
TV/Internet $142
Gym Membership $32

I also am currently using the car which myself and my now ex-gf financed together.  It is under her name but we have both been making 50/50 payments for the past 2 years.  She had agreed to let me use the car until I get back on my feet, after which she will keep the car and take over payments, as I cannot afford the $400 monthly payments on my own, but she can.

I also was gifted a loan of $5000 from a close friend to help me get on my feet.  I have tried hard not to spend this money, but am relying on it somewhat until I get my raise in order to make my monthly payments.  The person who gave me this loan is the business owner I work for, a close friend.  There is no time-line to pay this back and no interest rate, but I'd like to get it payed back as soon as possible. I have no used any of it yet.

I have no savings, no RRSPs, no other assets.

Debt/Credit:

I owe a total of $30,081.23 in student loans.  This is currently on an interest and payment exempt period for the next 8 months.

I have a single credit card with a limit of $3000, it is fully paid off.

4 Years ago I had much more credit card debt and had to consolidate my credit cards.  I did not claim bankruptcy, rather went through a company to consolidate.  This resulted in a R7 raiting on my credit score. I have paid off all of the credit cards included in the consolidation, and the balances were paid in full, they simply reduced interest rates to 0% and agreed to a monthly payment.

I am currently in the process of trying to rebuild my credit, and just was able to get this current credit card and start the process.

I don't know what my current credit rating is, but I'm assuming it's not great. The current card I have is a gold mastercard, which is for rebuilding credit. I did not have to provide secured funds.


Questions:

I need to get a vehicle, as the job and city I live in is not going to work with me taking public transit, it's just not feasible.  I have the $5000 loan available to me to use for this.

I could finance a cheaper card, something for $200 a month, but then I'm also looking at $130 insurance premium per month plus cost of gas which would be around $100 a month.

I could also use a portion of that $5000 to buy an inexpensive car to get me by for the next couple years until I have more money available to me.  A $2000 beater to get me from point A to B.  This would leave me with more money every month to pay back debt and save.

What should I do here?

Where should I start in terms of savings, emergency funds, rrsps, TSFA's?

Basically, what should my priorities be in terms of my personal finances?

Thanks.",finance,1398176522

| $4,700    | $5,500           |   3.4%   |  Subsidized  |

**Remaining:** $16,100 (*$17,600 original balance*)

* Minimum Payment: ~$200/month
* I pay: ~$300/month

I was unable to meet minimum payments until I got a decent job at the end of 2012. My credit score dropped to 390 and my total remaining balance went up to $20,000. After finally getting a job and making regular payments for a little over a year, I've brought my credit score up to 690 and my remaining balance is now $16,100. I have an auto loan that I'm not concerned about, but I make a hefty monthly payment toward that. I got a promotion at the beginning of the year which will allow me to contribute more to my student loan monthly payments.

Now I know my student loans are not as bad as some, but the fact that they exist is still enough to stress me out on a regular basis, especially with a 2022 expected payoff date (based on minimum payments and interest rates)... I just want to be debt free.

**Should I use my retirement fund to pay off my student loans?**

I have a 403b with a 12% employer contribution. The portfolio is currently valued at about **$8,000** (hopefully I'm using this terminology correctly) and has accumulated that in a little over a year. I understand there is tax and a penalty if you withdraw early, but if I understand correctly, you can start the retirement plan back up after 6-12 months? I could be wrong though.

Is it asinine to withdraw once my portfolio reaches $12-15k (next year or two) and pay off these loans in full?",finance,1398186214
personalfinance,"To Pay Debt, Invest, or Save?","I have been a working attorney for a bit over three years and started with with student debt of about $150,000. My interest rate on the debt averages ~7.4%. I have diligently paid down on my debt, but still have $117,000. I recently quit my job and changed cities, but project to make around $100,000 when I land with a new firm. I'm highly motivated to pay off my debt given the high interest rate. I feel like I am throwing money away every time I pay Sallie Mae for the rapidly accruing interest.

On the other hand, I have saved every month. I put $500/month into an Roth IRA and $500 into a mutual fund in order make modest gains before I use it as down payment for a house. I have about $70,000 saved between my IRA ($30,000) and mutual funds ($40,000).

Embarrassingly, I have very little financial education. I am starting to self-educate, but am not sure of the right decision to make. I feel like I should put $40,000 down on the debt and knock down the principal as much as possible and put off buying a house (the market in LA is crazy).

personalfinance,"$150K in debt: have a job offer and a plan, but might be screwing myself in the long run?","Hey PF, been a lurker for a while and this is my first post here which I guess has been a long time in coming. (throwaway account for obvious reasons)

Long story short, I made a *huge* mistake by taking out $130K in loans to attend a ""prestige"" school. I made out with a STEM degree, but I paid heavily for it. Compared to my younger self, I now know how deep of a hole I've dug myself into, and I have a plan to get myself out.

I received a job offer that has a base salary of $60K annually in a state with no income tax (yay), but it's in a rural area with not much going on except this facility. The job is a cubicle office job which requires specialized skills that I have, and the offer package includes full health benefits and a 401(k) with 3.2% matching that's 100% vested immediately. I can terminate my employment at any time for any reason.

-----

Now onto my debt. Here's a screenshot of all of my debts from unbury.me: https://imgur.com/a/IdDUR

The $2514.74 in the first screenshot is roughly the total monthly payment I can make towards my loans after required AND discretionary spending. My spending is tabulated below (all values monthly):

* Income

Item|Amount
:--|--:
Pre-tax Income|$4616
FICA Taxes|(estimate) $382.5
Fed. Income Tax|(estimate) $857.81 
**Net Income**|**$3375.07**

* Expenses

Item|Amount
:--|--:
Rent|(estimate) $750 
Groceries|(conservative) $250 
Fuel|(estimate) $40
Auto Insurance|(estimate) $100
401(k)|$150
Cell phone|$50
Min. Loan Payment|(estimate) $981.30
**TOTAL**|**$2312.35**

This means I would have about ~~$1640~~ $1050 leftover, and could put some or all of that towards loan repayment. The planned repayment schedule is in the screenshots.

-----

The logical choice from a purely financial perspective is to take the job. The job sounds miserable and I don't want to take it because of the location, but that would probably be a short-sighted decision on my part. I'd only work there for a year or two before either a) transferring to another facility, or b) quit for another job.

**My bigger question is job-related, and very important to me:**

* This is an industry I don't want to work in, and I'm afraid of pigeonholing my skills to the point where it'd be hard to jump industries/jobs later. If I worked in this industry/job for the 5 years it will take me to pay off all of my debt, I will definitely be pigeonholing myself, BUT I will be debt-free at the end of it. Is it worth it?

* I want to get a Master's degree at some point in the next 5 years to open up career paths, but I'm not sure how I can/should finance that while I'm still paying off this mountain of debt. Taking out more student loans sounds like an awful idea while I'm still paying off my first student loans...

Thanks for reading, any helpful input is appreciated.

Today, the Austrian National Bank gave a lecture on Bitcoin, together with The Austrian Federal Economic Chamber, with an open discussion possibility afterwards. I also participated in this lecture as I am from Austria and I was very interested in what our economists, bankers and other people who participated in the lecture think of Bitcoin.

**They all were pretty sceptical.** They adressed a lot of issues that come with the usage of Bitcoin as a currency. Here are the main issues they adressed:

* Many people buy Bitcoin to **hoard them for future capital gains instead of using it as a currency** (they often compared it to gold), which is, in their opinion, normal rational thinking of people (""Why should I use them if there is a good chance they will be worth a lot more in the future?"").
* **Volatility** - of course. For companies that sell goods or services for Bitcoin there are great workarounds to reduce the volatility risk (Bitpay, Coinbase). But the users have huge risks when using Bitcoin as a currency to pay for things they want to buy.
* **Shady exchanges**: With the recent MtGox disaster, people can't be sure if their funds are safe on exchanges. (But I personally think that this is getting better and better with things like prove of solvency and cryptographic audits)
* **Complexity**: I think 95% of the people sitting in this hall today still don't understand how to use Bitcoin in practise. The guy who talked most of the time had a too complicated and technical explaination for Bitcoin. It would have been MUCH better if he would have shown an example on stage or at least use an easy explaination with good, clear graphics or something similar. His explainiation was way too much for the average Joe.

**Are these issues something new? No, not really. 
Are they important for Bitcoin's success? YES!**

Guys.. we really need to think of these issues even more than we do now if we want Bitcoin to succeed. Although there were a few guys who really had a positive feeling about Bitcoin and its great opportunities, the majority was pretty sceptical about Bitcoin. 

We have come so far. But we need even simpler walltes. We need even safer exchanges. We need much more people who actually USE Bitcoin and not only buy and hold it. And we need to face the volatility issue which is in my opinion the biggest problem of Bitcoin (something that may stabilize in the future when Bitcoin gets a bigger and bigger userbase).

What can we do against these issues? Let's have an open discussion.

Now the reality has sunk in. I have signed up for Pay as you earn repayment, and there are two options regarding this. One, work for 10 years in qualifying non-profits making minimum payments and the debt will be forgiven. Two, make minimum payments for 20 years working anywhere and the debt will be forgiven.

I suppose I'm here to ask for two things -- one, moral support. This shit is stressing me out and I feel foolish for not grasping what I was signing up for. Two, after reading the MMM advice I'm motivated by the idea of knocking out the debt without doing those repayment plans so I can start putting the money towards other things. However...this seems bloody impossible. Is it better to simply live with the debt making minimum payments until its forgiven and start saving sooner rather than later? At best, my partner and I could make 100,000 - 150,000 combined. The high end of that scale may be a bit of a stretch. Any ideas/advice super appreciated.

gaming,Dear gamers everywhere.,"(first soapbox-ish post plz be gentle)

I think it might be time to excercise our responsibility as an online community to set the precedent for dissatisfied gamers everywhere and draw a line in the sand.

***I dunno bout you lot... but i've had enough of being sold (what im going to call) ""hope on a rope""***

Its just enough to get you invested... just enough to initiate that confirmation bias that things will get better (cos you already kinda like the game) im here to tell you... you don't like the game ... what you like, is the *idea* of the game... and they are making millions preying on that.

Gamers everywhere:- it's about time we get what we paid for. 

Gamers everywhere:- ***STOP BUYING HOPE IN ADVANCE.*** 

Gamers everywhere:- Pay only for a FINISHED product.

Do you go to the local car dealer and listen to the typical salesman spiel about how great this car is... then shell out all your money only to drive away with a car that is half finished... doesn't look as good as the pictures...doesn't start sometimes... randomly crashes... takes a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time to start. ETC ETC ETC... in this instance you could return it as a faulty product and get refunded.

You see:- car companies have a reputation to worry about... reliability is an important factor in car sales (for obvious safety reasons) so they MUST first and foremost be percieved as safe and reliable in order to sell units...

WHY... for the love of pixels... WHY is it okay for games to be released in this state? 
Where does the games industry get off pushing dodgy hype down our throats for premium prices?
or more importantly... why is it okay for games to contain an EULA that effectively releases them from ALL responsibility for the product?

Gamers... We need to rally and find the achillies heel of the of the gaming industry... 

Gamers:- games companies should be accountable TO US for their products... PERIOD. Not to the marketing team or production studio... US... (the people paying everyones wages) 

Shouldn't we stand against companies that offer dodgy products or ""out clauses"" so we can remember their reputations as companies? 

Shouldn't games companies suffer the consequences when they offer us anything less than amazing value for our money?

Surely only reputable companies should see the benefits of our loyalty... EVERY games company SHOULD ABSOLOUTELY BE PREPARED TO EARN AND KEEP THAT LOYALTY.

I propose... a metacritic style rating system for games studios as a whole... something they can be held to account on... judged on... remembered for... or avoided by!

Lets get our gamers informed about the choices they are making... lets give them the tools to judge the viability of their investment BEFORE they spend their money on the hope they have been fed by professional marketing teams.

Screw their hype engines guys... judge them! 

Judge them:- Functional (reliable 24/7)? 

Judge them:- Plays like the intro movie (not overhyped)? 

Judge them:- Value for money (getting what you paid for)? 

Judge them:- Contrite and honest dev/ marketing team?

I wonder what this one will cost.","The winners &amp; losers from Obama's Neocon Coup D'Etat in Ukraine http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/putins-approval-ratings-are-70-while.html

Winners 

Putin
Putin has increased his already high approval ratings and strong power base within Russia as a result of his actions in Crimea. He just got a 10 point bump in his approval ratings in Russia.

Vladimir Putin's approval rating hits three year high as Russians back president over Ukraine
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putins-approval-rating-hits-three-year-high-as-russians-back-putin-over-ukraine-9192170.html

Putin has also consolidated his power base among the oligarchs and power elites in Russia.
Putin gave the nod to his top cronies in Russia before he intervened in Crimea. E.G. the head of Gazprom sold ALL his sizable shareholding in the company a week or two prior to Russia's military intervention in Crimea.
The obvious message that Putin is sending out to the rich and powerful in Russia, is that working closely WITH Putin is worth their while and not working closely with him will cost them money. (The rich and powerful in Russia already knew this - but it's always worthwhile reinforcing the point by sending out pertinent reminders every so often.)
The stock market fall in Russia won't of affected Putin's inner clique much at all.
I wonder if anyone benefited by actually shorting Russian shares? (Shorting is betting that share prices will fall.)

American Neocons and Warmongers

The Neocons are using the American engineered crisis in Ukraine as an excuse to escalate global tensions and even start another major war or cold war with Russia.

http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/03/17/bill-kristol-calls-for-americans-to-be-awakened-and-rallied-to-war/

Israel is also trying to goad America into war, for the benefit of Israel and the certain detriment of over 99% of Americans. http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-israel-usa-idUSBREA2H0SV20140318

Arms Companies 

Calls to cut back on America's current astronomical level of arms spending (over $1tn a year) will now be more muted - not that there was much in the first place.
There may even be calls to increase it in the near future ""to counter the Russian threat"".
It's Cold War mentality and deeply against the interests of over 99% of Americans, but it usually works on a hugely gullible and ignorant American public.
Arms sales to the rest of the world are also likely to significantly increase if the Neocons succeed in engendering a new Cold War type mentality.

The Corporate Interests Behind Ukraine Putsch http://consortiumnews.com/2014/03/16/corporate-interests-behind-ukraine-putsch/

NSA and CIA

Calls to defund the NSA and to control the CIA will now be more mooted.
Who in Congress is now going to speak out against the recently revealed (to the mainstream) criminal activities of the intelligence agencies in the face of this new escalation with Russia?
At the very least the American engineered Ukrainian crisis will distract from the crimes of the CIA and the NSA.

Maybe the CIA and NSA should concentrate on spying on Russia, to glean Putin's intentions before he acts, instead of spying on Congress and the American people.
Maybe they already did and knew that Putin wouldn't take a coup in Ukraine lying down.
Either way it does not put the intelligence agencies in a very good light (but it is very doubtful that anybody in the mainstream is actually going to come out and say it.)

Just like 9/11 and Boston were massive intelligence failures and if the intelligence services were actually doing their supposed job of protecting Americans, they would never have been allowed to happen.

Republican Party Establishment

(See Democrat Party below.)
The Neocons who completely dominate the Republican Party Establishment will benefit from the renewed spirit of warmongering which is being encouraged in the Corporate owned and controlled media.
Recent polls were indicating that Americans were getting fed up with the endless wars and multiple interventions in numerous countries.

The number of instances of warmongering Neocons being treated as sane policy makers (rather than the insane people they actually are) has dramatically increased, e.g. on MSNBC in recent months.
E.G. John McCain, American Enterprise Institute, Brookings Institute, ex-advisors to McCain, wingnut Peter King etc. McCain personally met with the leader of the neo Nazi Svoboda party in Kiev, before the protests in Kiev escalated into shootings.

Losers

Barack Obama

Barack Obama is being portrayed as spineless and weak in a lot of the media.
A lot of it will stick among Independent voters - the only people that count in an election.
It will stick because it is true (but not in the way that the Neocon Corporatists like John McCain portray).
Barack Obama has never stood up against the big banks, the arms companies, big oil, big pharma, Monsanto etc. He has never stood up for, or worked for, the American people.
He is a spineless puppet for Big Corporate and Big Money interests .

The Neocons also portrayed Obama as weak when he did not pursue the Neocon agenda for overt full scale war in Syria for the benefit of Saudi Arabia, Israel, the arms companies and big oil.
He backed down in the face of overwhelming public opinion against war in Syria, a lack of international support - even the UK government could not hoodwink their Parliament enough to authorize it and he was going to lose the vote in Congress if he had pursued it.

Democrat Party 

The Democrat Party will lose further support from Independents in the 2014 mid-term elections.
Independents are the largest demographic at 40% of the electorate.
Democrat candidates were already up against it because of the slow-motion train-wreck that is Obamacare, which Obama continues to try and run from by delaying the fines for not being Obamacare covered.
See the recent result in Florida.

The young who were conned by Obama's empty and meaningless rhetoric in 2008 are starting to smell a rat in the face of the overwhelming evidence that Obama has reneged on numerous campaign promises.
He has just continued the disastrous economic policies of GW Bush and massively expanded the Mass Surveillance State.

Barack Obama : A Gigantic Fraud upon the American People
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/barack-obama-gigantic-fraud-upon.html

The economy is already sinking like a stone and despite the media headlines unemployment is going up, particularly among the young.

The Real Story on the US Labor market - only 42,000 jobs were added in February. Real unemployment just went up yet AGAIN. http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-real-story-on-us-labor-market.html

Ukrainian People 

The Ukrainian people are certainly going to be worse off as a result of the American intervention in the domestic affairs and Coup D'Etat in their country.
This is not exactly unusual - see Iraq, Libya, Syria etc.
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukraine-us-officials-and-us-media-go.html

Ukraine is already poor with a per capita income of only $6,500 a year.
It already had extreme difficulty in paying it's bills, e.g. the $2bn or so owed to Gazprom.
Russia had given Ukraine a 33% discount on it's gas - nearly half of it's energy supply.
Russia is likely to withdraw this discount, which will lead to the impoverishment of Ukrainians and have a severe detrimental effect on Ukrainian industry (they will be forced to pay market rates or 50% more for their gas).
Ukraine's industry is very inefficient and relies on exports to Russia (the only country willing to buy it's steel products). These have now been put at risk, through higher energy costs and e.g. via new Russian trade tariffs.
Unemployment in Ukraine will no doubt rise as a result of American actions (the American actions were never designed to benefit the people of Ukraine).
Ukraine has now lost the very significant gas reserves in the Black Sea around Crimea, which it could of used to revamp it's economy. Exxon and Chevron were planning to put up $1bn as an initial investment for exploratory drilling.

The story sold to poorer countries that joining the EU will provide benefits and better job prospects might of been superficially and temporarily true when Poland joined the EU in 2004.
It no longer is. See Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Cyprus, among several other countries that are in deep economic trouble.
The EU is bankrupt with massive and rising National Debts, over 500 insolvent banks and massively high unemployment - an average of 12%.
I very much doubt that the German people are going to be overly enamored with helping Ukraine - they are already crying foul from the continuing bail outs to the rest of the Eurozone.

Calls for secession in Eastern Ukraine are likely to substantially grow as economic conditions in the country rapidly deteriorate
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/calls-for-secession-in-eastern-ukraine.html 

Ukrainian's hopes that the EU &amp; US will provide a solution for their problems are just pie in the sky
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukrainians-hopes-that-eu-us-will.html

The American People (update 03/22)

US actions in Ukraine provide fresh impetus to drive Russia and China closer together and crush the Petrodollar
http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/us-actions-in-ukraine-provide-fresh.html 

Any success that the Neocons manage to achieve in increasing US military spending will go straight on the debt mountain and bring forward the date of the coming dollar and economic collapse.

Germany?

The German economy has nothing to gain and several ways it can lose from the American provocation of the Russians in Ukraine.
Higher Russian gas prices or a disruption to supplies would immediately hurt the German economy.
The last thing that Germany needs is another European country wanting an EU bailout.
Germany had made deals with Russia for a direct gas pipeline avoiding Ukraine.
Germany has already made tentative moves towards closer trading ties with China and away from the US.
Merkel has been the most conciliatory of the EU leaders towards Russia. She doesn't want to see Germany being the pig in the middle of a spat (and maybe much worse) between America and Russia.",finance,1398215476
personalfinance,"My parent's plan for student loans, input?","Like many others who have posted i'm starting college soon, I'm taking 5,500 out of federal unsubsidized loans, and ~7,000 of another loan (haven't found which one yet). My parents said they could pay off my loans for me while i'm in school because my dad set up $1,200 for me every month and they want me to get a loan to build credit. 

So ultimately they would be paying ~12,500 every year in loans with me budgeting and helping with what i can.

Does this work? Is there anything we're missing? This plan makes me nervous because the loans have to be in my name and though I know my parents have the money i'm afraid it won't work out and i'll be stuck with the loans i didn't want in the first place (I only wanted 10,000 in loans)

I think I might just be stressed out about this because of all the stories and would hate to have unnecessary debt if there credit plan doesn't work..

personalfinance,Advice on Car Purchase/Taxes [BC/CANADA],"Sorry for wall of text (Just got off long shift not using my brain that much right now)


Ok so let me tell the back story, I currently have a 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt right now that has a lien of $13,532 (@6.99% interest) on it for 4 1/2 years I'm making $280.82/month payments on it. I bought it back in October 16th at 84k km on it. It is now April 22 and it currently is sitting at 123k km (Ya i know a crap load of driving in 6 months... Its 60/40 work/pleasure vehicle, mainly work though) and since buying this vehicle I have done maybe 9 or 10 oil changes done at $65/trip. There are some massive problems going on with the car right now, here's a list of things so far...

* Transmission - dealership said about $800
* Rusted fuel pump - TBA
* Windshield - $200 to replace via insurance or $400 no insurance
* Left Speakers x2 broken - $200 for all(4) speaker replacement
* New tires - $600 4 tires
* Cracked Rims x4 - $150 for 4?
* AC doesn't work - TBA
* Timing belt needs to be changed soon (Hasn't been changed ever) 
* Also only get about 14L/100km (Somethings VERY wrong there) ($55-60 to fill up and only get about 300km off of it)

$2250± 

Now since I've gone over the 5K km mark the dealership wont cover anything under warranty (Yay me! that only took me 2 weeks!)

So those are just the things I can think of right now.

I'm thinking about getting a new car, a 2014 Dodge Dart GT (got a FIAT engine which means HUGE gas savings) now since I work in insurance and work side by side with a dodge dealership they are able to give me the car at a dirt cheap price (Wholesale +$500) fully loaded with everything it has to offer. The car is going to cost me about $18500(without load attached) $32000(with loan attached)@  $208/bi weekly(@1.69% interest) WITH the loan of my previous car added in and a trade in value of $3000. 

I took the car out for a test drive for 3 days and they filled up the vehicle with $20 worth of gas, well that $20 got me about 200km so I'd be saving money on gas for sure with this purchase, as well the insurance is going to stay the same, plus the interest rate is a LOT lower too.

With my job I am a loud to write off my vehicle expenses too, Car payments, Gas, Insurance, Maintenance for the amount that I use the vehicle for work.
Now I use it 60/40 split for work and pleasure. How do these expense write offs work? Do I just get the money back or something? or Does that just get reduced in the amount the government can take in taxes? This is what that has confused me the most so if you could somehow ELI5 that would be great...

What I'm pretty much asking  is with the amount of repairs I need to do with the load on my vehicle is it worth keeping it and driving it to the ground or would I be making a good decision to get a new vehicle that has warranty for one and will last me a little longer and save me a load on gas too?

If there's anything else you need to know ask me and I shall answer.

TL:DR
Own a gas guzzler with lien of $13,532 @6.99% interest for $280.82/month and needs a LOT of repairs/maintenance to survive any longer
Thinking about buying new fuel savings car for $18,500 @1.99% interest for $208/bi weekly(with lien attached)
With work I can write the amount I use the car for work (60%) off, this means maintenance/car payments/gas/insurance

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 












 
 
Bitcoins in Space One Step Closer
 
- BitSat Design Study Announced
 
 
 
ATLANTA, GA. – April 23, 2014 – Bitcoins took one small step towards space today with the announcement of a preliminary design contract between Jeff Garzik’s Dunvegan Space Systems and Deep Space Industries Inc. as part of a drive to develop an orbital system for the not-for-profit BitSat project. The BitSats will comprise an orbital node for the bitcoin network now on Earth with a constellation of tiny BitSats continuously broadcasting the latest bitcoin block from orbit, enhancing the resiliency of bitcoin in the event of disruptions or outages to the terrestrial bitcoin P2P mesh network. 
 
 
 
“Private spaceflight is breaking big, driving down costs so that great ideas like BitSats are within reach of even volunteer nonprofits,” said Garzik, who is organizing a donation-supported campaign to build and fly the system.  “We want to keep bitcoin healthy and free by finding alternative ways to distribute block chain data.”
 
 
 
Bitcoin transactions become official once a group of them are encoded – or “solved” by independent computing efforts -- into a block and added to the blockchain, a record of every bitcoin transfer ever made.  BitSats broadcasting the most recently solved blocks will provide a cross-check to verify that the blocks available on the terrestrial network haven’t been spoofed, as well as providing the latest blocks to locations off the terrestrial grid.
 
 
 
“Deep Space has always said we are about using space resources – this includes space itself,” said Rick Tumlinson, the company’s Chairman. “While this announcement may surprise some people, it is actually very much in line with our spacecraft development plans, including another private spacecraft system we will be announcing in a few months that will use many of the same components and systems. This means much lower costs - very important for the donation-based BitSat effort.”
 
 
 
BitSats may employ the CubeSat standard of individual cubes 10 cm (4 inches) on a side, with one to three such cubes potentially making up each BitSat.  They will be sent into orbit as hitchhikers on the launch of much larger satellites, lowering the cost of placing them in orbit.
 
 
 
“I believe space holds the promise of our future, and also offers a lot of utility right now,” said Garzik. “I chose DSI for this project based on depth of their proposal, the expertise they have internally and within their network and the fact that they are pushing the cutting edge – just as we are at Dunvegan.”
 
 
 
Deep Space Industries will develop detailed requirements for the space and ground segments of a BitSat constellation, and preliminary plans for the architecture, operations concept, and spacecraft design.  The resulting blueprint for next steps will be published in August for open community evaluation at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitsat-project.  Dunvegan Space Systems is collecting donations  for the BitSat project via the bitcoin address 1M9MyyPsAak7zRjW4D96pTxDaAEpDDZLR7 processing through payment processor BitPay.
 
 
 
“The goal is to design a downlink system from the satellites to the public that is as open and inexpensive as possible,” said Daniel Faber, the chief operating officer for Deep Space.  “While most people will buy their downlink setups from a vendor, ideally a smart hobbyist should be able to download a design and build their own receiver from much less than $10,000.”
 
 
 
ABOUT DUNVEGAN SPACE SYSTEMS
 
Dunvegan Space Systems is an early stage spaceflight micro-company.  DSS operates the non-profit BitSat project.  A strong proponent of private spaceflight and open source, DSS believes the private spaceflight industry is best incentivized through small, cost effective, attainable missions based on open designs. The BitSat project fits within that larger vision. Dunvegan Space Systems is exploring technologies and business models whose goal is a solar system wired for networking, with data centers on Luna and Mars. These missions and business models are made possible through expanded competition and lower costs in the launch and spacecraft manufacturing industries. Through the design and eventual deployment of the BitSat constellation, Dunvegan Space seeks to demonstrate that a functional space-based network may be developed at low cost.
 
 
 
ABOUT DEEP SPACE INDUSTRIES:
 
Deep Space Industries is a space operations, exploration and resources company. With several billionaires and nations competing to reduce the cost of launching into orbit and announcing plans for facilities and voyages into the Solar System, Deep Space is moving into position to supply the materials and propellant needed to cut the cost of staying and operating beyond the Earth.  Deep Space is tapping “local” in-space resources such as near Earth asteroids, starting with a prospecting campaign to find the richest targets, and then developing cost-effective ways to process asteroid materials into products for the in-space markets. Steps now underway include developing space capabilities, a knowledge base and top level expertise in all aspects of space related to the discovery and production of space resources and enhancing low-cost space commerce, from spacecraft systems design, operations, astrodynamics, science and resource utilization as well as user and broad customer/community development.

My payments of $1339 a month are preventing me from putting anything into savings, retirement, buying a home, etc. I came across an article that mentioned SoFi, and am interested in seeing what they have to offer. I would also prefer to pay 1 or 2 lenders instead of the current three. Any advice is greatly appreciated, especially with regard to which loans to ReFi and variable vs. fixed interest rates.

 i keep a tight budget and use tools such as mint/YNAB. 
I saved a good amount of cash after exiting the army and also through my unemployment. However while traveling the united states last year seeing old friends from my years of service, i was pulled over on ""invalid registration"" and had my car illegally searched.

finally at the tail end the final court costs completely consumed the small emergency funds i was building. and now i do not know what steps i wanna make. 

Should i start my GI Bill?

news,I will never smoke again unless my government makes me,"I will never smoke again I unless my government makes me. 
I had my first clove cigarette in 1983 at a bar on The Hill in Boulder, Colorado. The place was called Pogo’s and it was the place to be seen during the peak of New Wave.

Music, hairstyles, clothing, trends that would last the decade and define directions for years to follow were all part of my lifestyle. I hadn’t expected smoking to be part of my lifestyle though, but those gateway cloves, they were yummy. And trendy. You weren’t cool if you didn’t have one dangling from your lip like Ray Stantz.

From there I moved to Marlboro reds, and stuck with them for 10 years until light cigarettes became a stronger marketing focus of the tobacco companies. They told me they were better for me, and I believed them. All along I knew cigarettes were bad for me. I engaged in various dangerous hobbies, scuba diving, off-roading, motorcycling, I was bullet-proof and figured dying from smoking was for old people.

My Mother smoked for the last 30 years of her life and I remember the day she found out I was smoking. She wasn’t pleased. It wasn’t her that got me hooked, but she blamed herself. I used to drop by her office outside Boulder, where she managed drafters, and I would watch them all drawing and designing amazing things with a cigarette in one hand and a mechanical pencil in the other. Everyone smoked back then. It was accepted in business and in public much like it was at the bar where I first started. My wife smokes too, we met at a bar, smoking, indoors, like so many people did back then. Her mother smoked, and her brother, a sister, her father, a brother-in-law. Everyone smoked.

As I continued to smoke, I realized I did it for the nicotine and the social aspect of smoking. It was all about that hit from the nicotine and the action of holding, smoking, and interacting with the cigarette. They really didn’t taste that great, as manufacturers put less tobacco, and more “everything else” into them, so it was less and less for the advertised “flavor”. I also realized I should quit, because now I was a grown-up with responsibilities. It was going to be an uphill battle.

In 2004, I tried Nicotine (Polacrilex) gum. “This could work” I thought, “this could be my way out of smoking”. It did work, but not the way the package stated it would. “12 weeks” the box told me, and I would be nicotine free.

Twelve weeks turned into 5 years.

My body didn’t want to be nicotine free, much like it doesn’t want to be caffeine free, and quitting gum was harder than quitting cigarettes. Then I started smoking again. Smoking while chewing Polacrilex gum. I had an addiction one could possibly compare to the likes of heroin addiction.

I recently turned 50, and thought about my Mother dying at a similar age. I was now that old person I told myself I wasn’t so many years ago. Looking forward at a possible early death, or toting oxygen around while still fairly active, I made the decision.

I started vaping.

I did a few weeks of research, got in my car on a warm Friday afternoon, and drove to the nearest e-cig store. $50 later, I had the hardware and liquid for myself and my wife. I was ready. I had tried vaping a few years earlier outside a bar in New York City, it tasted ok, but the fellow who let me sample it made it look overly complicated. Times have changed, it’s amazing what simple technology can accomplish.

It’s been two weeks, and I haven’t had a cigarette or piece of nicotine gum since.

I feel wonderful.

I smell good. I can breathe. I can taste food. I’m going to live longer.

I'm $300 a month richer.

For the first time in over 30 years I can honestly tell myself and others that I will never smoke a cigarette again, unless of course, my government makes me, which is what this story is about.

The “electronic cigarette” was invented in 1963, but the current vaping industry is grassroots, created by people looking for a way to quit smoking cigarettes. It was not created by tobacco companies, nor by pharmaceutical companies. It was created by people like me, for people like me, people who still want nicotine without all the drawbacks of cigarettes, like dying.

My government, at both the state and federal level, doesn’t want us to vape. They won’t exactly say why, but legislation is in the works, or already in place, which bans or limits access to devices and liquids which help prevent people from dying. Think about that for a moment. Vaping hasn’t killed anyone in the 8 years it has been publicly available. In that same timeframe, roughly 3.5 million people in America have died from cigarette smoking related illnesses.

My government, and governments in other countries, and very large corporations want to prevent people from not dying, because of money.

The media is suddenly awash in articles about nicotine liquid poisonings, without actually comparing them to other household poisonings. More people were poisoned by houseplants last year than nicotine liquid, but that doesn’t make for big headlines, because houseplant companies don’t have competition putting them out of business. The media tells us about flavored nicotine liquids attracting children, but they don’t mention children overdosing on flavored chewable vitamins, or eating sweet smelling air fresheners plugged into the wall, because no one is trying to put those companies out of business either.

They also claim vaping is being targeted at teenagers in the hopes of them eventually switching to cigarettes. Would a teenager really switch from an inexpensive habit to one that costs two to three times as much and doesn’t taste good?

Legislation is also in place or in the works to tax nicotine liquids at similar rates to cigarettes, even though there is no proof that vaping is as harmful, and it’s proven that it is orders of magnitudes safer than smoking. Cigarette excise tax is in place to help offset medical costs in this country and others, why tax something that will decrease medical costs?

Pharmaceutical companies lose money when vapers like me don’t spend $150 a month on Nicorette they can’t quit.

Tobacco companies lose money when vapers like me don’t spend $150 a month on cigarettes they can’t quit.

The government loses money when they can’t tax something to the level they tax cigarettes.

Now I face an uphill battle again. A battle against my government, pharmaceutical companies, and tobacco companies. This amazing device has shown up that makes my life better, that will let me live longer, and they are all rushing to figure out how to monetize it or prohibit it because they don’t understand it.

That scares me more than dying from a cigarette ever did.

I could fill 10 pages with research, but that is best left up to you, the reader. If you are interested in the future, and a safer, smoke free world, simply turn off the news, read, learn, and spread the word.

I am now an advocate.

I just started, but I have converted two smokers to vapers in the last week, and I will spend every day from here on making sure that every person I know who smokes, either quits, or switches to vaping.

Imagine if all of you did that too.",technology,1398295086
investing,"Why should I buy bonds now, when interest rates are so low?","With interest rates at such historically low levels, it seems that rates can really only go up. I know attempting to time the market is usually a bad idea, but what incentive is there to start buying bonds now? Stocks can always go up or down, but interest rates can only go so far down. 

I only have a small portfolio ($20,000) but it's 100% stock index funds right now and I would like to get a percentage of my portfolio in bonds. After some basic reading though, it seems this may not be a good time for that.

personalfinance,"Please help! How in the world do I save for retirement, live life, and pay all this debt at the same time?","I would greatly appreciate any advice on budgeting, investing - anything to help reduce my almost constant anxiety (and 4am panics). My husband and I are both early 30s and just started working at our first “real” jobs in the past 6 months after many years of graduate school. We just purchased our first home, which I was very anxious about during the whole process and am now regretting. We are spending so much more on housing each month plus all the repairs that need to be done. Retirement has always been on my mind as graduate school took longer and longer to finish and now that I have an actual salary, I want to start investing, but I’m not sure if we can. When I look at our monthly income, it seems like we have so much, but then it is just gone! Our student loan debt is overwhelming and most of it is on the standard 10-year repayment plan. We would like to have a child within the next year, but that also seems impossible. It seems like we can either save for retirement or have a child (while ignoring debt). How do I make this all work?
I have all my accounts hooked up to mint and try to stick to the budget I set there, but it does not always go well. Also, the past few months have been slightly atypical with moving, paying a large penalty for breaking our lease, etc, so looking for trends has been hard.

personalfinance,Do banks give loans for vacations? Would this be a terrible idea?,"I'm a student and the semester is just about to end. I have not been able to work much this semester due to the demands from school, and therefore I have only about $600 to my name right now. In about 2 weeks I'll be working some more again but its only going to be about $400-$500 a week probably. I'm looking to take roughly a month long trip to South America, which I think I will need between $3K-$4K to do. Once I return (probably around the time school starts back up), I'll be able to work part time for the next school year, after which I will graduate and hopefully get a good job. This may sound like a bad plan, but heres the thing: I have very low expenses. During the school year, I only need to pay for my food (about $80 a week), gas (which is very minimal, roughly $10 a week), internet ($50 a month), and whatever other miscellaneous cost I incur ($20-$30 a month). Everything else is taken care of. So really, I could have a $4K loan paid back in less than 5 months I think. So is there any reason I should not do this? I have never taken out a loan before and I'm pretty sure my credit score is fine. I have heard of banks giving loans for vacations but is it very common? What are the interest rates like? How do I go about applying for a loan?",finance,1398320427
Bitcoin,Let's create our own currency!,"OK, let's create our own currency and call the unit of currency a Shell (like what the Flintstones used). I will be in charge of circulating them and you be in charge of printing them. So, where do we start? First, I will sell you an IOU worth 100 Shells for 90 Shells. You print/create the 90 Shells and exchange them with me for the written IOU. I will then spend the 90 Shells on groceries. So, at this point, 90 Shells are in circulation and I owe you 100 Shells.

Alright, as an 'authority', now I will tax the income of the grocery store 10%, which is 9 Shells. I'll also sell you another IOU worth 200 Shells for 180 Shells. With these 189 Shells I now have, I will take 100 and pay off my first IOU to you and spend the remaining 89 on fuel and an oil change. Now, at this point, 170 Shells are in circulation, you've profited 10 Shells, and I owe you 200 Shells.

I could go on, but does this system seem odd to you? At this point I owe you 200 Shells, but the only way for me to pay you is to sell you more IOUs. Even if I was somehow able to re-collect all 170 Shells in circulation, I could never pay off my full debt to you (worth 200 Shells).

Isn't it a crazy system? Truth is, the US dollar works this way. Simplifying it a bit... the US Treasury sells bonds (IOUs) at a discount. The Federal Reserve prints currency (dollars) to buy some of them up (from bankers as middle-men). The Treasury then spends that currency on typical government expenses (wars, salaries, interstate highways, foreign aid, Presidential vacations, etc). Admittedly, it is only necessary for the Treasury to sell bonds if tax revenue doesn't cover the entire cost of all government expenses... but, since 1960, only 5 times did they not need to sell bonds (they sold them anyway). This is a system that works very well for the Treasury because they can spend money they don't have and it also works very well for the Federal Reserve because they're profiting heavily from interest on the bonds. However, it harms the consumers who are being paid in the currency and use it because, over time, the currency they own becomes more common and has less purchasing power. 100 years ago, with $4 you could buy the same amount of goods as $100 is able to buy you today.

The main problem with this system is that it's based entirely on debt. If both the government and consumers started making it their primary goal to pay off the National Debt as well as all consumer debts, very quickly the economy would just run out of currency in circulation and the whole thing would freeze up. As foreclosures and bankruptcies started becoming common in 2008, that almost happened. This is why I'm in favor of alternative currencies, like Bitcoin, that are not operated in this way.",cryptocurrency,1398322656

Bitcoin,Using a nation's fiat currency is passive support for all of its social and economic policies.,"Unless you are actively involved in politics, using a nation's fiat currency (the United States Dollar, for example) is passive support for its social and economic policies.  Unfortunately, if you are a North American then merely voting in the ballot box simply doesn't qualify as ""actively involved"" (let's face it, the choices given between Republican and Democrat are mostly meaningless.)  Much more important is, as the saying goes, ""voting with your dollar.""  By using the dollar, you prop up the United States Federal Reserve, its Legislature, many American corporations that have twisted laws to their own benefit, and all of the greedy moneygrubbers on Capitol Hill that pass self-interested legislation.

For example: the United States has very punitive drug prohibition laws.  These laws, which imprison people (citizens and foreigners alike) for drug possession, trafficking, sale, and manufacture, artificially inflate the prices of many drugs such that the profit potential is simply irresistible for people that are willing the break the law.  Law enforcement officers arrest criminals, criminals go through the justice system, and criminals get put behind bars: all on the taxpayer dollar.

See where this is going?  By using the dollar, you are passively participating in this entire system.  Now, you could be very actively involved in politics and lobbying and grassroots organization...  And if you are, then *bravo*.  Much more likely, however, is that you are not.  In that case, the most important way you vote is with your dollar.

Bitcoin allows you to decouple your everyday life from the tainted politics of the United States Dollar, freeing you from the Fed and allowing you to participate in a truly market-driven currency.  Vote with your bitcoin--or vote with your cryptocurrency of choice if bitcoin isn't it.  But please: consider the effects of lending your support for the dollar and consider weaning yourself from it, or else go get active in politics and try and change our odious laws.

What are the first few steps I should make to get this to be manageable?

Thanks for your help.

Edit: thanks for the responses everyone!

In regards to take home pay, I get about 1000 every 2 weeks. I pay my debt in this order:

Student loans, about $800 per Mo.

Car, 210

Credit cards, about 200 minimum pmt

Rent, 387

Utilities and cable, 50

Cellular, 80.

This sums to around 1725, leaving me &lt;300 for food and rest of life. At this point I will not have put any extra toward debts because there was none. And usually I end up adding a bit to my credit cards. This is irresponsible, I know, but it is very difficult to avoid. It sounds like I may need to pick up another job from what I am hearing.",finance,1398357458
personalfinance,Downsizing to one car to purchase a home vs. continuing to rent,"Background info:
I currently work full-time and have a part-time freelance job on the side. My yearly salary is around $60K with both incomes. My wife and I just had our second child, and we are hoping she can stay home to raise the kids for at least a couple of years, then she’ll go back to work.  

We pay $1,300/month in rent for a 3-bedroom, 2-bath home. We want to move into a 4-bedroom home.  Our lease is up in August and we have to decide whether to stay another year (the rent will likely go up to $1,350 if we stay only one year), or purchase a home. 

We have around $30K in student loans combined, with a $320 combined monthly payment. We have one car loan with a monthly payment of $262, and own our other car, which is worth about $12K. 

We have $5,000 saved toward a down payment on a home. I am considering downsizing to one car by selling my car for $12K and either putting that entire amount into the down payment fund or contributing $10K to the down payment fund (making it $15k total) and keeping $2K aside (perhaps as a start for a second car fund). 

Since my wife is not returning to work, we would share her car and she would drop me off and pick me up from work, while we slowly start replenishing our savings fund and eventually buy a second car without taking a car loan. 

I figure our budget would be $240K max for the home. We both have excellent credit (over 800). With a $15K down payment it looks like we could get around a 4.7% interest rate on a 30-year fixed loan, making the monthly mortgage payment around $1,200 - $1,500. 

I suspect the fiscally smart thing to do is to keep saving and wait until we have a full down payment and a sizable emergency fund before buying, but it will be a very long time before we can make that happen realistically. 

I live in the Denver area, and have heard from several people that home prices are going up and will continue to go up, and that if we do plan to buy, we should do it soon. I saw this article today, and Denver is included in the list of cities where home prices are rising. http://money.cnn.com/gallery/real_estate/2014/04/22/housing-market-prices/3.html

personalfinance,Husband and I are completely in a hole (CA-B.C.),"So, my husband and I about 5 years ago BOTH went through a job loss and we ended up digging ourselves into a massive hole. Credit is destroyed. We have combined $7000 in credit card debt, $6000 car repossession (written off), Owe BC-MSP $4000 (my wages are presently being garnished 30% for this). We pay $700/m rent, $70 internet/power, $250/m cell phones (we both require large amounts of data for the work we do and have already fought Rogers and that is the lowest rate we could squeeze out of retention for the internet we need), $240 month car insurance, $380/m car payment (we just managed to by the grace of god refinance at a 4.99% interest rate, it was WAY more before). My credit score is at a 571 and he is at a 600. We have so many different payments going to so many different places it's hard to keep up and our money just disappears. We're making about 2400/m after my garnishment. My husband is now being threatened by his creditors. They want $3,200. Nothing that we can actually afford to pay is good enough for them and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before they start garnishing him too. Already After food, gas, incidentals we are left with basically nothing. We can scrape by, but if anything unexpected comes up we're hooped and if we get further garnished, the hole is going to get deeper because we will have to give up paying for our vehicle, have it repossessed. If we can hang on to our car for at least 1 more year we should be into positive equity on the vehicle. I'm not sure what to do and the stress is eating us alive. We have considered bankruptcy but we really want to find a way out without going that avenue. I feel it may be our only way out. Any advice?",finance,1398364364

I have to move out from my parents' home. I'm gay, no longer Mormon, and we are clashing a lot, so it's time that I move out. I'm planning on leaving starting with the next school year in August.

So, at first I was looking at off-campus apartments and room shares, but I realized that living on-campus wouldn't be that bad, as most utilities, internet, etc. is included in the rates.

I know it's not up to PF standards at all, but it doesn't matter to me right now. I will move out for my sanity. I also purchased my car last year (2013 Kia Soul, base model, manual(!)), and I know that it's a crazy loan. It was a bad decision, and I think I can live with it. I don't have time to deal with repairs if I buy an older car because I literally don't have time for anything besides my fulltime school and work. I need a car that is almost guaranteed to not break down, and I'm planning on keeping it until it dies.

OK, here's the breakdown:

Monthly income: $1700

Expenses:

Car payment - $300
Insurance - $157

On-campus rental rate - $625 (utilities, internet, w/d, amenities included)
Food - $300

Income - Basic Expenses: $318

Current Assets:

Cash - $3000 (emergency fund)


Current Liabilities:

Car Loan: $13242 (13.17% interest rate, planning on refinancing this summer)

Student Loan - $5000, deferred until graduation

I know it's tight, but I'm very disciplined with keeping budgets. I've been saving for the past few months and able to reach a $3000 emergency fund. I'll keep saving religiously over the summer to increase that.

So I know that most of you will tell me to sell the car. I explained above why I don't really want to now that I've already taken the depreciation hit and will run this thing into the ground, plus my time is very precious.

I just want to know, will this work? I can survive, right? I'm in a very good place as far as my job goes. I've advanced quickly and gotten two raises in the past year. I can only expect to keep increasing that income over the next few years, and I'm guaranteed a job as an accountant for this company once I graduate.

So there you go. Please let me know if I can do any better than this.

Thanks!

worldpolitics,NARENDRA MODI –Dictator or Messiah,"The storm in the teacup has actually morphed into the storm on the electoral landscape has many worried brows across the intellectual class of India. Narendra Modi commands blind faith and support, going by the crowds in his rallies which is mostly spontaneous and does not appear to be stage managed, has relegated issues and meaningful discussion on governance to the background with the one point agenda, public frenzy being to see this messiah of the masses anointed as the saviour on 16th May, 2014. In this charged up and volatile atmosphere mostly driven by youth yearning for change, as youth is always wont to do, voices of reason and sobriety are probably getting drowned out or is it just another case of some not coming to terms with a phenomenon which has caught the imagination of the large mass of people. A few questions that keep cropping up about Modi :
1. Is he communal or anti Muslim – The fact that Narendra Modi was propelled to national and international fame was because of the 2002 communal carnage in the state of Gujarat. Prior to Modi taking over Gujarat the state was known as the riot and curfew state of India with Hindu Muslim tensions peaking every few years under Congress led state governments in major riots in 1969, 1980, 82, 1985, 1992 with the 1985 riots going on for six long months and 1969 reportedly taking nearly 5000 lives. However, Hindu Muslim tensions in that region predate India’s Independence and have been going on for a few centuries ever since the  Muslim invader Mahmud of Ghazni and his hordes in 1024 AD came raped, looted, plundered, converted and destroyed the Somnath temple, among many other temples, the sacred shrine of the Hindus. The 2002 riots were preceded by  Godhra where 59 Hindu kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya were burnt in a railway compartment by a Muslim mob. Like any other politician he milked the Godhra incident and subsequent riots from a narrow perspective because of the long running underlying mistrust in the Hindu community against their fellow Muslim citizens who the Hindus felt had got away with rash and irresponsible behaviour during Congress governments in the state where the state machinery was openly and blatantly used against the majority community to cover up for the misdeeds of the minority community, often pampered and goaded to misbehave, with an eye for votes. Further Narendra Modi had just taken over the Chief Minister’s post just four months before. Besides in his second term as Chief Minister he took on hard line Hindu groups, virtually evicting them from Gujarat reportedly destroyed many Hindu roadside temples encroaching on public space and focusing on the development model of economic growth which he knew would be more acceptable and win him elections.
2. Is his Gujarat development model a mere propaganda – His critics particularly the opposition parties keep on harping that his Gujarat model of development is a hoax and not supported by facts and figures. When the ordinary Gujarati citizen is assured of 24x7 power, water, good roads and excellent law and order and no riots or curfew post 2002 and has reposed faith in him in three successive elections then these criticism cannot be taken seriously.  Independent visitors with no political affiliations both domestic and international often come back singing paeans to the changes that are taking place in Gujarat.  In an era of excessive media coverage it would be difficult to pull off a bluff for too long and the fact the he has sustained for the last twelve years and  three elections, the last one more resounding than the previous two, probably reflects the reality on the ground.
3. Is he a dictator – India is a functioning, noisy and extremely open democracy and Gujarat happens to be one of the twenty nine states in the union. It has a vociferous but weak opposition in the Congress party which has a pretty poor record in governance in the state for nearly forty five years. Within his party and across the state Narendra Modi is seen as a decisive leader, disciplinarian, personally honest, and totally performance oriented often not taking no for an answer. The fact that he may not be a dictator can be gleaned from the fact that bureaucrats from the All India service often fall over each other for getting a posting to Gujarat reportedly for the freedom they enjoy in the work space. Modi comes across as a man with a lot of common sense, he would have to be immensely stupid to think that he could operate as a dictator in a federal system in India where many states are ruled by strong regional political parties. 
4. Will he be the messiah who will deliver (if elected) – He seems to have the right intent, he knows growth has to be inclusive, he has shed the right wing baggage in the second term in office as Chief Minister, he is fully aware that he faces huge challenges especially on the economic front and that he alone cannot achieve that. He may not have fancy foreign degrees to his name but he has some simple home grown solutions for India’s growth story which he has successfully implemented in Gujarat and there appears to be no reason why he cannot do so at the all India level, after all good governance is no rocket science. For him to be the messiah he will have to have sufficient numbers, preferably 272+, greater clarity and of course the blessings of the Almighty in a hugely spiritual country where one’s past life karmas and actions in this life decides one’s destiny. 
However, for millions of Indians who are apolitical but care about their democracy it is not about a messiah or a dictator, a rickety coalition or a weak dispensation but all about a strong and stable government which has the numbers to support it and a decisive leader who is authoritative (not authoritarian) and inclusive to take the country forward in an uniquely Indian way – simple, homespun and uncomplicated.",technology,1398410979

worldpolitics,"Massive income inequality and the real problem it causes - widespread, self reinforcing corruption","http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9HCU3onVYs/U1oEkaGYX8I/AAAAAAAAA48/9_HiZLcWIow/s1600/Income+inequality.png

http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/massive-income-inequality-and-real.html

The problem we now have is that excessive and widespread income inequality is creating a vicious circle of increasing corruption and a vicious economic downward spiral.

It is much easier now for the very wealthy to bribe the government to make money, than it is to make money from entrepreneurship.

Feeding at the government (read taxpayer) trough does not create wealth, in fact it harms wealth - somebody has to pay those tax dollars that the wealthy are taking and those other people are the middle class and the wealthy that are not government cronies. This leads to lower disposable incomes, lower spending, fewer jobs, higher unemployment, lower wages, lower disposable incomes etc.

This is the vicious circle we have seen since 2000, where a decline in the middle class is punctuated by financial asset bubbles and consequent crashes from excessive money printing, the excess money printing which hurts the middle class and the poor even more. (This process has been going on less visibly since the mid 1980's and the key change to allow this to happen, occurred in 1971, but we will get to that later.)

 

This is the vicious circle of sub par, sub 2% growth.

This is the vicious circle of ever declining real disposable incomes of the lower 99%.

This is the vicious circle of very high and continuously high unemployment.

US unemployment is now at 11.5% if European criteria of unemployment measures were used.

Official U6 unemployment (which is never mentioned in the mainstream) is now 13%.

Unemployment and underemployment taken together are at a historically unprecedented TWENTY THREE percent and rising.

The people that have a vested interest in keeping the current system going are covering up the real unemployment statistics and the decline in middle class wealth.

These people are the politicians (almost all of whom are getting major bribes), the government (who get lucrative post government jobs), the economists for the major banks (the big banks are the largest beneficiary of the current system, together with the arms companies), government economists (they would be out of a job otherwise), economists that rely on patronage (or as a minimum non-disparagement) from the Federal Reserve for their livelihood.

The mainstream media also have an inherent interest in maintaining the status quo.

The owners and executives of mainstream media are reliant on other large crony Corporations for their advertising revenues. They are also reliant on the major banks to roll over their debts.

The executives then hire mostly dumb front men (or air head blondes) as the TV front men (or less frequently people that will keep quiet for money).

Laws are being passed which continually reduce the influence of ordinary people and increase the influence of wealthy people, on elections.

Recent examples are Citizen's United, recent Supreme Court rulings to remove the few laws remaining on limiting campaign financing and GOP rule changes at the Tampa convention in 2012.

What we now have is a perfect storm of an endemic, almost total and massive system of corruption that benefits the very wealthy at the expense of everyone else.

This is the reason for the continuing increase in income inequality.

The reason is naturally kept hidden from the vast majority of the public (it simply couldn't exist if a significant proportion of people understood how the system works).

The system currently in place will continue to get worse, it is self fulfilling and self perpetuating.

It will continue to get worse until there is a massive systemic failure, like there was in 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930's.

The point of systemic failure is now, not too far away in the future.

N.B. While the US remains the most prominent system of hidden endemic corruption, just about every Western country has the same problem to a greater or lesser degree.

The EU operates a massive system of bribes, corruption and cronyism with the unelected officials that run the EU.

There are massive problems within the UK, Canada, Australia, France, Italy etc.

b.	401(k) retirement account

personalfinance,I am considering a new car and I feel like I don't know enough to make the best decision for the long term.,"In December of 2012 I bought a 2010 Subaru Outback with 50,000 miles on it. I love this car and it has treated me well but when I purchased it I never expected to have to commute with it. Fast forward to the present and I have been working a full time job commuting 60 miles a day 3-4 days a week (I sometimes am able to carpool with a friend) since December 2013. The Outback does not get the best mpg and my wallet has been hurting. It is certainly not a commuter car. My monthly payment is $260 and my interest rate is (I believe) 2.1%. I still owe roughly 13k on the vehicle.



As I am now working full time,the prospect of moving out of my parent's house is more and more a reality so I have been really anal about my finances lately. I want to make the best decision regarding my car. I see so many attractive lease offers on TV for low monthly payments and great gas mileage but I am not sure if leasing is the right option. I still have roughly 4 years on this loan but if I own it outright (possibly even pay it off quicker) I could run it into the ground and get over 250k miles which is not completely uncommon for a Subaru. I just don't know what to do. I am paying way too much for gas at the moment. Between commuting, driving to my girlfriends house thirty minutes away, going camping on the weekends, it's just been too much. I would love to save money but if there is value in keeping my car and owning it outright eventually I am all ears. For what it's worth I am 23 and just now trying to get a head start on my finances and make good decisions because I certainly did not this through high school and college.

investing,"A sanity check before investing long-term (featuring multiple currencies, inflation and diversification). Any input appreciated!","Hello fellow redditors! I came up with a disciplined plan to start saving up to guarantee some level of stability for my life. I hope to present a solid plan that hopefully some other people can use, and that some of you will have some input about it!

**Goals and context**

I'm from Switzerland, so my retirement and emergency funds will have to be in CHF. The rest however is what is interesting. The goal for me is to maximize my personal wealth and financial stability. Losing money is not an option. I have a career that does well financially, so I don't need risk, it would just be nice to float around/over the inflation rate.

**Safety net**

So, long-term, I plan to have ~60k in a savings account that I can get out any day of the year. (CHF is about the same value as USD so i'm using CHF in my calculations).

The split goes as follows:

- 15k for bills in January (I pay what I can annually as there is a 1% incentive to do so in most cases. That's like having 2% yearly interest on my money, which is huge for CHF)

- 30k for car replacement or repairs. Avoiding any leasing is a good idea.

- 15k to live on in case of emergency. I'm covered for unemployement, but having a buffer is always best.

The two first items are accounted for in my budget, so this is not really going to eat up the amount I can save.

I also currently max out the amount I can put in retirement to save on tax, and this happens to cover what I need to live decently after I retire. My retirement is half-half between the SMI (Swiss market index) and a bank savings account getting me about 1.325% (The advantage of which is that I can use this money later on for a down payment on a house)

**Bonds or no bonds?**

The current interest rate seem to be 0% and inflation isn't much higher, so it would be difficult to see it going down. Savings accounts are at 1%, some investment-grade (BBB- and up) bonds go up to 2% for 8 years. I personally think it makes no sense for me to currently invest in bonds in any major way, as my objective is to be covered against inflation.

**Diversification**

Currently, a 30% of my spare money after everything is paid goes to retirement. So that leaves two thirds to invest. So, including retirement, that will diversify into:

-- 40% CHF --

- 15% SMI (Retirement)

- 15% Retirement savings

- 10% Swiss Stocks

-- 60% Other --

- 10% Commodities

- 20% US Stocks

- 15% European Stocks

- 15% Emerging Markets Stocks

**Stock picking strategy**

Here's where it gets a bit more complicated. I could put everything in a mutual fund and not worry about it ever after. But I think one of the pivotal points my career could take me to professional investing. I'm currently a Software Engineer and learned all of what I know by myself, and I will be spending time doing my research. I know about the tech market and wish to invest most of my money into it. Having my portfolio to back me up could also be beneficial in the future. For this horizon, I'm sticking with ""If it will be around in 20 years, it's a good investment""

I wouldn't hold more than 2% in any position, so each month I'd find new positions to invest in with my last paycheck until I get down to those 2%. When it comes to commodities, I think having 2-3 commodities would work well. I'm doubtful when it comes to gold so I'd stay out of it as everyone and their dog is already into that, but I'd invest equally in a few others.

personalfinance,"Offer was accepted on a condo, should my backup plan be to pay cash if loan falls through?","Hello PF,

I am 27 and put an offer on a condo which was just accepted (homepath property, 3% off closing cost incentive). I tried to do this a year ago but the loan fell through because I didn't have 2 years self-employed tax returns within the state. I now have them but I have the risk of the loan falling through again because my income declined the second year. It was about a 30% decline because I took 4 months off to go backpacking canada (first vacation in 7 years). I wrote a letter explaining all this to the lender and my current P&amp;L for the year has me surpassing the entire previous years income by quarter two. However, I don't have a backup this time if the plan falls through. Since most loan companies go through Fannie or Freddie I am trying to come up with an alternative solution.

Some of my reasons for wanting a condo and not rent are: saves money (~300/mo for comparable place), looking to stay put for at least 5 years, we are thinking kids in the future, GF just got a job 8 months ago and loves it, her company is thriving (promotion on the horizon once she hits 1 year), my company is thriving (having most profitable year ever with long term clients in place). 

So here are the details:

Purchase Price: 123,500

Mortgage (20% down) + Insurance + HOA (some utilities are covered by HOA): $710

Equivalent rent for 2 bedroom: $1050 + rent increases 9% after the first year. has happened last 2 years we have been here for this cheap of rate. private landlords are $1100+ but probably more stable in increases.

Assets:
Liquid Savings: $50k

HSA: $6500

IRA: 30k

Vanguard Taxable Investments: 30k

Business Savings: $45k

No Debt

Monthly Expenses: $1600 ($1000 is current rent + utilities)

Anticipated salary this year before taxes: $70-100k


I have been cash heavy in the business and personal accounts for some time simply because I have been waiting for the housing situation to stabilize in case I needed to do something like this.

So if I leave 10k in savings, 15k in the business, leave HSA/investments/retirement untouched I can scrape together about $70k. Another 10k would come from GF and getting unpaid invoices caught up. I would need the remaining ~43500k as a family loan (only if they are willing and able). I hate debt so my primary focus in year 1 would be to repay all of that. This year after taxes I would suspect I could make $30-50k. My GF also has $1200 excess each month that is currently going to student loans. So in total in the next 8 months we could repay that family loan fairly easily. By buying it outright it would eliminate around $500 worth of mortgage payments for an additional $4k in the next 8 months. We also plan to do AirBNB and some family guests wish to rent a room for some additional income, not counting on this though. This means I still have 6 months of expenses in my savings for emergency, more than 100% of my deductible in my hsa, corporate account is sitting useless anyways, and all debt could be re-paid in 8 months. My GF also has 8 month of emergency fund. 

Psychologically I am a little uncomfortable with the thought at the moment because I typically have a large cushion. However being debt free again in a year is very appealing. The savings really start to kick in on year 2 without a mortgage and I could focus back on retirement. If I qualified for a loan without politics I would be happy with 20% down, invest the rest to earn much more than the 4.X% interest rate. The rent vs buy calculator puts me at break even point of 2 years if I needed to re-sell. However self-employed always puts me in a bind so I have to think unconditionally. If the loan goes through, great, it worked. If it fails to go through, is this idea a really bad one?",finance,1398442434

Bitcoin,China and Political Implications,"Bitcoin has political implications for the US, but the US can also reposition BTC. The US populace generally has a an attitude of mixed fear and loathing of the Chinese, and I think BTC is a great cornerstone piece for juxtaposing China and the US. 

By focusing on China's hostility to BTC because it does not fit within their state-controlled paradigm, even to the detriment of its citizens, US policy makers can choose to embrace BTC. This should accomplish a few things (and obviously it's not a one-step or linear process)

1. US supports the BTC environment, driving adoption and price. If the US engages in pro-BTC policy (and i think things like the IRS policy really are), that will be hugely beneficial to BTC. China will be left in the dust as the rest of the world shifts to electronic free banking.

2. BTC supports the US environment. By contrasting the authoritarian, anti-freedom culture of China, the US can reposition itself as a free, open, and competitive country. I think most millennials see the increasingly sticky workforce, stagnating wages, and increasingly oppressive regulatory environment as big government and corporations engaging in non-competitive collusive behavior. Obviously the fed is included in that. By taking a stand with bitcoin and against China, the US can re-align itself as a pro-freedom environment that encourages productivity, innovation, and a fluid labor force. If the BTC interest groups can gather force, they can spread that free-market alignment throughout the US political infrastructure.

I realize this takes years or decades to accomplish through many disparate interest, but I think that US support for BTC would be mutually beneficial, and deal with the US' primary opponent internationally. Any thoughts?",cryptocurrency,1398448869

personalfinance,Interested in the best course of action to save for graduate school and retirement. Any help would be appreciated!,"Hello r/personalfinance! 

I was hoping to get some guidance on the best way to save for grad school and retirement. I'm taking a gap year before going on to get a PhD in Marketing. I'll be graduating in about two weeks from my undergraduate institution, and luckily I was on full scholarship so I don't have any type of debt. However, I also don't have much in the way of savings either. I currently have about $1200 saved up, though I may need to use all of that for moving costs this summer.

I've already secured a job for the next year at a Fortune 500 company, and I'll be making $47,000 gross, but approximately $35,000 net after taxes (Federal, State, and Local) have been accounted for. Additionally, a bonus of 10% of salary is offered once a year if you meet goals, which I believe I will. My costs per month are as follows:

* Rent: $500 (Could potentially increase as high as $650 when I move, but will hopefully remain around $500)
* Utilities: $100 (sometimes lower, never higher though)
* Car Payment: $375 (Buying car from parents, no interest, will be paid after 12 months)
* Phone: $90
* Health Insurance: $115
* Car Insurance: $90
* Gas: $100
* Food: $300
* Going Out: $200
* Total: $1665

So given that, I should be able to save about $10,000. My company offers a few options for retirement:

401k matches 50% up to 6%, BUT they will only vest 20% of their match per year, so really it would be a 10% match.

They also offer stock at reduced price once per year if you've been working there for 6 months. As long as this fell after my 6 months, at the company, I could participate. 

I'm planning on attending grad school next year, and luckily the programs I'm looking at offer a tuition waiver and a stipend of around $25,000-$30,000 per year, but the cost of living in those cities is much higher than it is in my current city, so I'd like to save up an emergency fund, just in case cost are much higher than I'm used to and the stipend falls short. I'd really like to avoid taking out loans during graduate school, but of course I won't really know whether or not I have to until I find out what the stipend/cost of living is wherever I end up getting in. 

So my main questions are:
* Should I invest in my company's 401k plan, or open up a Roth IRA since I only plan on staying for a year?

* How large of an emergency fund should I try to save up and will I even have enough left over to put money into a Roth IRA after my emergency fund?

* Is there any type of higher yield, short-term saving options that I could put my emergency fund into?

* If eligible, should I participate in the stock program?

* How can I still save for retirement during my graduate program? Is that possible?

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment - help!,"So I am trying to pay off my student loans as quick as possible. Now I have a question about Public vs Private loan repayments. Right now I have about an even amount split between public and private loans (about $25,000 each, $50,000 total). Now, my Public loans are 6.8% and my private loans are between 3.11% and 3.15%. Now, I have been reading and although I understand it is better to pay off the higher interest rate loans first, since my interest rate on the private loans are so low, does it make sense to pay off the public ones first and take the risk? As it stands right now with the payment plan I am on, I will be debt free January of 2017 with all things staying the same. Should I shift my large payment over to my Public loans??

personalfinance,"x-posted to r/student loans: Was given some options for repayment by the ""Student Loan Processing Center"" and am skeptical.","Hey guys, I finished up school in may and acquired about $50k in student loans, I started repayment in January, paying about $550 a month. It's been a little tight, but I've been managing. 

[I received this letter about a week ago.](http://imgur.com/A2VLmor)


I called them up and asked about repayment options and applied, they had access to my FAFSA account due to my federal loan status, all they asked for was current tax info and my social for verification.
They offered me a few reduced repayment options with a 300 month forgiveness program. Here's where I had a moment of panic.


They said my best repayment option would be income based, and would go from $550 a month a $70 a month. After 300 months, all of my federal loans would be forgiven.
They mentioned a $600.00 fee for consolidation and administrative processes, which they could also break into payments.

personalfinance,College Graduate: Questions about investment,"Hey guys,

I don't know a lot finance and investing so I thought I would validate my investment plans with you guys. I also have a few questions at the end. Some stats first:

- Age: 24

- Student loans: $63k (~$40k at 6.8% which is the highest interest rate)

- Other debt: $0

- Emergency fund: $16k

- Base salary: $100k

- Rent: $0 (living with parents)


So here's what I'm thinking based on what I've read so far. I should max out my 401k and then pay off my loans. But I have some questions.

1.  Should I also create a Roth IRA? If I'm already maxing out my 401k, am I really going to need all that money when I'm 55-60 years old? Furthermore, I believe I will require more money within the next 20 years than I will need in 30 years so I'm a little apprehensive about locking up too many investments that I can't touch until retirement.

2.  How much of my earnings should I dedicate to paying off my student loans? Based on my plan right now, it would be almost everything not going towards my 401k.

3.  I want to buy a new car (let's say a luxury car) in ~2-5 years and a home in ~10 years. I want to save up money for this in hopefully an investment account that grows. I've been looking at index funds and am wondering if this is a good route to go? Can I invest money in these funds and just ""forget"" (i.e. just leave the money in there) about them until I need to cash out? Or are they like stocks where I have to pay attention every day (or week/month)?

personalfinance,Question on calculating estimated taxes,"I live in NY and work primarily as a freelancer. My income jumped this year to around 62k after graduation, however since I work as freelancer I have no money withheld from my checks. I've been setting aside 30% of my income since I started working last fall of 2013 and did fine for taxes, but I'm a bit confused over my estimated taxes for this year.


I went through the info available on the IRS' website and after calculating everything, I estimated I should owe a little over 10.5k as I'll be in the 25% tax bracket this year. However, when I did a test run on TurboTax, it estimated my taxes at 18k. Granted, I didn't fill out any other info or deductions, I just entered in my salary and breezed through all the pages to get a number as fast as possible. I also found this withholding calculator from the IRS for 2014 income tax returns, and based on a 62k income, with no deductions, filing single, I should owe 8.3k in taxes.

Here's the withholding calculator: http://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/


Any idea why I'm getting such radically different results? I made my first quarterly payment last month for 2.7k (2.1k for the fed, 600 for NY state) based on the 8.3k figure I received from the IRS withholding calculator (8,300/4 = 2,070), but as I'm currently budgeting 30% of my income just for taxes, I have a lot of cash left over in case I need to increase my payments for the remaining 3 quarterly payments this year.",finance,1398477647

Shortly there after I moved in with my mom and step dad (he was still alive at the time) and we've moved a couple times since then-with the eviction showing up on our record.  Thanks to my mom's good credit, and the fact we paid double to triple the deposit, we were able to get an apartment and later rent a hose.  We last moved Oct 2011.  I'm 35, hubby is 36.  My mom's health is pretty fragile, and if something was to happen to her, I'm not sure we could keep the place we're in as it takes all of our income.  Hubby's SSI check would cover the rent (his SSI is 918, our rent is $750.)  I am my mom's health care provider and the state pays me (after taxes, union dues, health insurance) $575 a month.  If she was to die today or go into a nursing home, we'd loose that $575 a month.  Thanks to some bad choices I made in my early 20's, my credit score is around 575.

personalfinance,Buying my first house. My brother wants to be financially involved -- is his plan fair to me?,"I found a house in foreclosure near my work that was the perfect size/location. I told my brother about it. He wants to become financially involved and put money towards the house and build equity (anticipating profit). He also wants to find a renter for it, and take half the rental proceeds. I am not so sure that is good for me, but I don't have a lot of money, and he does. There is a long story attached to this, however. I will try to be brief.

TO BE CLEAR: The house is in my name, I have the final say on everything! I just want everything to be fair.

Is it fair that he pay for $12k worth of repairs and then ask for half of all rental proceeds? We could likely fetch $1,000/month to rent out the first floor, and I could live in the basement. The mortgage payment will be around $1,200/month. I can afford to pay the mortgage payment on my own, but I wouldn't mind some help, as that is about the most I could possibly afford.

What if I said, ""okay, you have to be landlord,"" though? Since the tenant will be someone he knows, and I won't be living there. Does that make things make sense?

Here are some more details:

My brother is a local businessman, talks to a lot of people in business and city government, and always seems to have his ear to the ground. When I initially told him about the house, he looked at it and told me this: The Park District wants to buy the property as soon as possible, but they couldn't bid on it immediately because of Federal Housing Authority rules. Basically, first time homebuyers like me get the first crack. My early offer was accepted and the Park District was shut out. His story about the Park District wanting the house was corroborated by multiple unconnected people.

My brother convinced me that the house can be flipped for a good profit, and I believe that is 100% true. The Park District will at least give me fair value, and the home was already undervalued because of broken pipes in the basement and mold damage, and other small necessary repairs. Upon close inspection, all the repairs turned out to look scary, but are a simple fix.

I was unable to pay cash for the house, and had to finance it with an FHA 203k (renovation) mortgage. This means that all the repairs (re: the broken pipes/mold in the basement and a few other small things) will be tied into my total mortgage. Few lenders are interested in these types of loans, however, for a lot of reasons that don't need explaining. Even worse, the lender I found made me go through ONE company for all the repairs. I could not do the majority repairs myself, which I wanted to do, and I could not be the general contractor for the job, either. 

I got several bids from general contractors, but they were all came in around $30k. Doing my own research and talking to everyone directly, I learned I could get everything done for around $12k, with a small amount of work done on my own. But only if I had the freedom!

That's where my brother comes in, again. He offered to have his company GC the project. It will save me a lot of money, but now he is inextricably tied to this house. Like I said before, he wants to throw in money, pay for all the repairs, and build equity. This will of course decrease the interest paid on the house and benefit me, but I am worried that he will want to start making decisions regarding the house, and I will be pressured to give up total control.

I feel this is a very complicated situation and I definitely haven't told the whole story, but I can't seem to figure this one out on my own. Thanks.",finance,1398537335

Bitcoin,Sanction of the victim - One who condones current monetary policy is just as guilty as the one who perpetrates it.,"This is the story of how I realised that we need something like Bitcoin. It was long time ago, but because Bitcoin is now here, I want to talk.

Twelve years ago, when I worked in your world, I was an inventor. I was one of a profession that came last in human history and will be first to vanish on the way back to the sub-human. An inventor is a man who asks 'Why?' of the universe and lets nothing stand between the answer and his mind. 

Like the man who discovered the use of steam or the man who discovered the use oil, I discovered a source of energy which was available since the birth of the globe, but which men had not known how to use except as an object of worship, of terror and of legends without a thundering god. I completed the experimental model of a motor that would have made a fortune for me and for those who had hired me, a motor that would have raised the efficiency of every human installation using power and would have added the gift of higher productivity to every hour you spend at earning your living. 

Then, one night at a factory meeting, I heard myself sentenced to death by reason of my achievement. I heard three parasites assert that my brain and my life were their property, that my right to exist was conditional and depended on the satisfaction of their desires. The purpose of my ability, they said, was to serve the needs of those who were less able. I had no right to live, they said, by reason of my competence for living: their right to live was unconditional, by reason of their incompetence. 

Then I saw what was wrong with the world, I saw what destroyed men and nations, and where the battle for life had to be fought. I saw that the enemy was an inverted morality-and that my sanction was its only power. I saw that evil was impotent-that evil was the irrational, the blind, the anti-real-and that the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it. Just as the parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind and were expecting me voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no power to enforce, just as they were counting on my self-immolation to provide them with the means of their plan-so throughout the world and throughout men's history, in every version and form, from the extortions of loafing relatives to the atrocities of collective countries, it is the good, the able, the men of reason, who act as their own destroyers, who transfuse to evil the blood of their virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of destruction, thus gaining for evil the power of survival, and for their own values-the impotence of death. I saw that there comes a point, in the defeat of any man of virtue, when his own consent is needed for evil to win-and that no manner of injury done to him by others can succeed if he chooses to withhold his consent. I saw that I could put an end to your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my mind. I pronounced it. The word was 'No.' 

I quit that factory. I quit your world, I made it my job to warn your victims and to give them the method and the weapon to fight you. The method was to refuse to deflect retribution. The weapon was justice and Bitcoin. 

To win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the world of your past, with the doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists for the pleasure of others. Fight for the value of your person. Fight for the virtue of your pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: for his sovereign rational mind. Fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute rectitude of knowing that yours is the Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for any achievement, any value, any grandeur, any goodness, any joy that has ever existed on this earth.",cryptocurrency,1398546840

When I started to feel better a few months later after my thyroid was removed, I went through my mail (I had no bills being delivered to me at that time so I didn't really worry about it).

I received  a ""no stance"" from the Ohio Liquor Control legal board, and a green light by the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Trade Bureau (TTB). I reached out to the Ohio Department of Public Safety, as they are the group which actually enforces Ohio liquor laws. I had lengthy conversations with them, which were positive, yet they had not given me an answer yet. All of these agencies were intrigued by my request, listened to my explanation of Bitcoin/Bitpay, and I stressed that we in the Bitcoin world want to be included in regulatory discussion, not just discarded by closed-door rulings (like the IRS ruling). 

This past week we were featured in The Plain Dealer, and are on the front page of today's business section in print. The reporter pressed this department of public safety for an answer. They ruled that Bitcoin is a commodity, not a legal currency, and could not be used for purchase of alcohol. 

This, to me, marks a first for a US regulatory agency to effectively ban bitcoin. 

I personally think their conclusion is unfortunate, and is indicative of the type of senseless obstructionism small businesses face from many antiquated  and complicated laws and regulations. But, it makes for an interesting new chapter to the Bitcoin story and an interesting topic to present at our launch event. I fear this will set a precedent for other areas of the US as Bitcoin continues adoption and so I plan to do whatever I can to keep this issue alive.

I look forward to your comments, suggestions, and thoughts about this turn of events. Read about their ruling below:

For now, some of our Bitcoin Boulevard will be unable to process Bitcoin payments.

EDIT: Spelling and grammar. 

**EDIT 4/29/2014:**

In response to http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/248p8j/residents_of_ohio_please_contact_your/:

The reddit community had some valuable suggestions. 

The ODPS has to stand by their statements, as this was made in our major newspaper, The Plain Dealer. 

However, this decision was made late Friday and of course no one can be reached on weekends there. I contact the agent in charge yesterday, and they are going to reconsider their position, hopefully in time for our event on Thursday. 

Most of these merchants are using BitPay with 100% USD settlement. So, this is no different than accepting a foreign credit card. The transaction is between BitPay and the merchant, not the customer and the merchant, and this transaction is 100% USD. THIS is not what was passed down to the legal team at the state, even though it was thoroughly discussed. What was passed down was only the information about BTC-BTC direct wallet transactions, which only 1 merchant was hoping to do. 

The agent gave me the opportunity to submit in my own words what needs to be conveyed, and I did this with support from BitPay, including additional information from BitPay themselves. 

What I am hoping for now is a compromise. 1) No for BTC-BTC transactions for alcohol, as this would be barter, and is prohibited by current Ohio liquor law. 2) Yes for BTC-USD using 3rd party payment processor like BitPay, no different than foreign credit card transactions not originating in USD. 

This is a work in progress, as to be expected. 

This is also required part of the Bitcoin adoption process. It would be incredibly irresponsible not to include the regulators in this conversation, as the merchants' entire livelihood is at stake when it comes to liquor control violations. 

For the people who are attacking the decision to proactively seek regulatory approval: Would you rather exclude the entire restaurant and bar business in Ohio from Bitcoin? Not one bar will adopt Bitcoin in Ohio without written approval from these regulatory agencies. Bitcoin is far more that a political statement, it is a statement against the traditional banking industry. Small businesses must work within the political regulations they are bound by.",cryptocurrency,1398622020
personalfinance,I haven't filed state taxes in 3 years. I was owed a refund each time. Repercussions?,"&lt;dumb&gt;

Since the end of free iFile from my state (Virginia) a few years ago, I have not wanted to pay to file the return in order to collect my $2, $11, and $27 respective 2011, 2012, and 2013 state tax refunds. At the time it didn't occur to me to get a tax form from the library and mail it in.

What are my options? I always run everything through TurboTax and I get a refund each year so far. But what if one year I owe and need to file, will that trigger a review and/or an audit? 

Should I just get the back forms from the IRS, find the W-2s and the federals, and copy the information over and file? Any fees or risks with that? I want to make things right but not sure of what I'd be setting myself up for.

personalfinance,I just learned that a couple I know has a $3000 loan with 30% interest and I'm afraid they don't realize just how bad this situation is. Any advice?,"The loan was with a carecredit credit card that many might be familiar with.  It was for a vet bill when their dog broke her leg.  The original loan was $3000 and they didn't pay it off in the 6 month zero interest time period.  Now that the interest is in effect (it's in the ballpark of 30%), the balance is now $3300.

I know one obvious option for them is to make priority #1 just paying this bill off ASAP.  I'm just afraid that if they had trouble paying it off before that they'll be just as bad now, only they'll be swimming upstream with this massive interest rate.

Are there any other options?  Can you get a loan from a bank for this sort of thing?",finance,1398635446
personalfinance,Student loan question.,"I am wondering if I should use my savings to pay off my student loan.

Some background: I am 26 years old, currently unemployed (job hunting around the clock) and receiving unemployment which is about $260 a week (which will be ending shortly unless congress extends the unemployment).
I live with my parents, don't pay rent, and try to save as much as I can.

My only debt is my consolidated student loan. I currently owe about $32K which has a 6% interest rate. I pay $300 every month toward the loan.

I currently have $29K in my savings. My parents are offering to loan me the difference if I choose to use the $29K to pay off the only debt that I have.


I don't know much about finances. Is this a good idea? Should I pay the loan off and deplete my entire savings? Or should I continue with my current payoff plan?",finance,1398637023
Bitcoin,Has anyone here purchased Bitcoin to buy from Colorado dispensaries?,"As mentioned, it looks like due to the disconnect between feds and state government, while weed is legal in Colorado, banks won't do business with dispensaries. This is producing the ironic bane of the drug dealer: tons (literally) of cash. Requires same sort of protection as illegal dealers require which is no doubt pricey. (As seen on last episode of HBO's Vice.)

There is a proposed (maybe operational now) vending machine and I would guess the dispensaries themselves would accept BTC. Solves a big problem.

So has anyone here bought using BTC and specifically acquired BTC to buy from dispensaries? What was your experience?",cryptocurrency,1398639683
Bitcoin,"After seeing dogecoin's nascar, would the folks from r/bitcoin be interested in sponsoring a professional athlete?","My friend is a professional surfer who recently lost his sponsorship from billabong after around 10 years riding for them. He just bought a house a couple of years ago and very recently and and his girlfriend have just had a kid and I imagine he's feeling pretty uncertain about what the future holds for him at the moment.

I haven't spoken to him yet but I was wondering what people thought about perhaps getting him an address and some sponsorship from our community so that he could continue his career and simultaneously promote bitcoin to a crowd that I think could have a lot to benefit from adopting bitcoin.

I've been travelling for the last 9 months and bitcoin was extremely useful for me on several occasions. 

1. I wanted to purchase a car but my ATM withdrawal limits meant that I could only withdraw $1000 a day. I was under a bit of a time imperative and only had a couple of days to find and buy a car before beginning a road trip and I wouldn't have been able to get enough local currency out to pay for it. Enter bitcoin.... I signed up to localbitcoins.com, found a buyer in minutes and voila, I had $3000 local CAD by the end of the first day. 

2. I left some of my surfboard and gear with a friend I was travelling with as I was planning on meeting back up  with them however, plans changed and I didn't end up getting back to meet them. I had him FedEx my gear from Mexico up to the States but I didn't have any AUD to transfer to him to pay him back, nor did I have the means to get him Pesos or USD. Enter bitcoin and within a couple of seconds I have reimbursed him for the favour.

3. I was owed some money in CAD from a friend, however if they paid me back into my Canadian bank account I would have had to pay some silly amount to have a couple of hundred bucks wire transferred to my Aussie bank. Enter bitcoin, and I simply had them purchase some coin on localbitcoin in Canada, send them to me where upon receiving them I could change them over for AUD locally. 

I appreciate the fact that I probably lost a bit of money along the way with less that ideal exchange rates on localbitcoins however, for the sheer convenience of avoiding WU and the Currency Exchanges and being able to avoid banks, I'd happily do it again. 

International surf travellers and the international travel community in general could benefit a lot from adopting bitcoin. It could eliminate the need for travellers cheques, or prepaid visa travel cards, or simply carrying around big chunks of cash. As the exchange rate stabilises and more bitcoin ATM's pop up in capital cities, airports, etc. the accessibility and practicality of using it as your main store of wealth will increase. 

I imagine the publicity would be a positive as many people see the ฿ across the nose of his board and start asking questions. He's one of the best big wave surfers around at the moment and gets a lot of photos in magazines and is often granted wildcards into events such as Pipemasters and Teahupoo.

Anyway, it's just a thought, but I'd be curious to hear some feedback on it.

personalfinance,I've got 150k in savings but I don't know what I'm doing. Please help.,"Ok, so I was smart enough to save this money but I wasn't smart enough to invest it.  This whole time I've been planning on buying a house for cash, cause it's the only goal I've ever had. After doing just a little research I'm realizing that I'm getting robbed via inflation.

I've got 150k, most of it is earning a measly money market rate.  I've got a wife with a kid on the way.  I'm 29, she is 26.  We have no debt, no loans, no credit.  Never have.  We've worked and saved for all of this money.  We have no assets, except a $10k RV and an old used car.  We also have no idea what we are doing.

Am I right?  It seems I might as well buy a house I want and pay an interest rate instead of paying for inflation.  Problem is we don't really want a house ""this second"".  Maybe in 4-5 years when the kid needs that rooted home.  We travel for work.  We've thought about purchasing a ~150k home and renting it out (which creates a new set of problems it seems).  Everyone I talk to about real estate says it's the best return for risk.

I guess I'm just looking for some direction.  After watching some videos in the Boglehead wiki, I realized I am being stupid for not investing.  The bogle stuff is the only sane thing I've seen in the world of investing which is why I've never actually invested.  I don't trust anyone because it all feels like a scam.  The bogle method smells sane at first sniff and it feels like something I can see myself easing into.  

Where do I start though?  Do I just get on fidelity.com and start buying index funds and bonds?  Our employers do not offer 401(k).

Say I do put my money in investment.  What happens when it comes time to buy a house?  Do I pull it back out, pay off the house and start dumping hard back into the investments for retirement?
If you say ""no keep money in investments and take a loan on the house"", why would I even buy a house?  Why wouldn't I rent and dump all my left over money into my investments for greater compounding instead of giving that money to the bank?

personalfinance,"Advice on fund placement - 401k, Roth IRA, HSA","My retirement savings is spread across three accounts and I'm depositing the maximum contribution every year.

__Employer 401k__:

The company offers 4% matching and there are no fees aside from the individual fund expense ratios. Any fees charged by the plan administrator are billed to the company and paid by them. I have many low expense-ratio funds available from Vanguard and I'm very happy with the options.

__Personal Roth IRA__:

I have a Roth IRA account at Vanguard and plan to keep it there. I'm quite satisfied with the options.

__HSA__:

I have high-deductable health insurance from my company, and they make the maximum HSA contribution on my behalf (free money). I'm generally healthy so I pay my small health expenses out of pocket and save receipts for potential future reimbursement. My HSA is with Bancorp, which I like because there are no fees, but there's also no interest and investment options are poor. I'm considering moving this account to Health Savings Administrators for access to Vanguard funds with a $45 annual fee. The other company I'm considering is Eli Lilly Federal Credit Union but I'm not keen on their $24 wire transfer fee that they take out of the account balance. The Health Savings Administrators fee can be paid by check or PayPal with non-HSA funds.

Target allocation across entire portfolio:

* 65% US Stocks
* 20% Bonds
* 15% International Stocks

All of the accounts I'm using have access to low expense ratio Vanguard Admiral shares. Which assets classes should I place into which accounts? My intuition tells me that I want to hold the things that will show the most growth in my Roth IRA and HSA accounts, as I won't have to pay income tax on those funds when I withdraw them in retirement.

Since the 401k contribution limit is much higher than the contribution limits for the other accounts, whatever asset class I choose to hold in the HSA and Roth IRA will be able to consume the entire balance and still be within my desired allocation.",finance,1398696478

personalfinance,Tax diversification for kids' accounts,"Key deets:

32 yo, married male

Employed by MidCapCorp in the US, maxing a 401k, two IRAs, a family HSA. Rest goes to taxable. Net worth ~$280k (been working 4yr total after grad school)

No plans to purchase a home in the next 5 yr

Wife is a family engineer, compensated in hugs for the next few years til she chooses to work again at which point we will probably just invest all her income

2 kids &lt;5 yo. That's enough of those.

Total take-home ~$10k/mo, overall savings rate of ~$60k/yr (28% fed, live in a very high tax state, but don't plan to stay here; I fully expect to ""graduate up"" in tax brackets in the next 5 yr)

I want to start earmarking some of the cash we are bringing in for our kids, and one way is via a tax deferred acct. For a few reasons I prefer ESAs over 529s - yes I know the NYS 529 is good - but since I don't *know* it would be used for qualified expenses, I don't think I want every dime to go there. I don't expect any grant aid anyway.  Roughly I am thinking $1k/yr for each child into an ESA and $1k/yr for each child into a separate account using a very aggressive portfolio (eg using AOA iShares Aggressive Allocation ETF in TDAmeritrade ESAs and VASGX LifeStrategy Growth in Vanguard accts for each).

I would prefer to hold the taxable accounts as true custodial accounts, but a move to a high tax European country is on the horizon, and this would make a complicated tax situation nightmarish. Since my company will gross me up, I think I could just open up new taxable accounts and simply earmark them for my kids to later gift to them over some years. As soon as they are old enough to get jobs and work (and assuming they are eligible) I also plan to open Roth IRAs for them and match dollar for dollar every dollar they earn into their Roth (I will make them save a portion elsewhere to educate them).

My questions are: 

Does anyone follow a similar savings diversification strategy? Am I missing something obvious in earmarking funds rather than using real custodial accounts?

What alternative strategies do you use, and what allocation strategies do you use?

I would love to know your ideas for saving for your kids.",finance,1398701710

I save around 300$ per month in investment trusts. I could probably save more, because in the last few months I have accumulated around 6k in my chequing account that I don't currently use.

I need a new car. Well maybe not, but my current 2003 Cavalier is getting rusted, to the point of no-return soon (to the point I'm kind of ashamed to drive it :/). Also has many repairs needed (new front bumper, window motor, muffler, tires, wipers motor and a lot of other little things). I thought about restoring it with friends, but I'm afraid if I start to put money in it I will always put more on a car that probably won't last me for many more years.

I think I earn enough to afford a reliable car. But most reliable cars not too old are around 10k (+tax, and this, and that). I'll have to pay high interest rates for some time to get, say, a 14k car.

On the other hand, a new car would cost substantially more, but also has some very nice pros (warranty, customized, clean history, and let's be honest, personaL satisfaction).

I'm looking at the Dodge Dart GT 2014. I like it, has all the options I could want from a luxury car fitted in a ""compact"" sedan. With a 5k down payement and 500$ trade-in value, it comes down to around 459$ / month for 4 years at 0.99% interests. Final car price, with 15% sales taxes (Québec ftw) and interests and all other fees is around 27.5k. I checked with many dealerships and I think I can get a few more hundred dollars down or some advantages if I negociate correctly.

I need your advice (and experiences), because I'm afraid I might regret it in a few years (or maybe still be happy with my purchase). A car is a bad investment, but I need one. Will the personal satisfaction, convenience, warranty, reliability and (hopefully) long life of a new car outweigh the 450 or so payments for 4 years?

technology,"The Future of the ‘Net – bandwidth, congestion and other developments – 1 TERABIT/second…","... This is safe for work...
  
No need yet for 1 Tbps transport backbones / networks…!!!???

We most certainly are going to need better technology and protocols deployed if we are going to continue adding more and more data/voice communication devices to the ‘Net, as well as the ensuing surge in voice &amp; data usage on and over the ‘Net. If we do not so sooner, rather than later we are all going to be choking on congested network congestions.

Except of course, for those that pay for “non-throttling,” “premiums for better service – thanks to the removal of Net Neutrality,” and any other schemes the telcos and ISPs can think of to generate more money grabbing revenues.

It appears that some firms, as indicated in Heavy Reading’s premium white paper, (www.heavyreading.com/details.asp?sku_id=3179&amp;skuitem_itemid=1555), seem to be indicating that the time is not quite ripe for 1 Tbps transport networks with regards to the coming shift to 400 Gbps backend / backbone network transport. Meaning that we’re not likely to see 1 Tbps quite just yet…

I would disagree with the Heavy Reading folks’ study. We will need speeds up to 1 Tbps ‘much’ sooner as more and more devices are spawned in this age of the Internet of Things (IoT), if not exponentially then at the very least VERY geometrically.

Look around, there is going to be a great deal more Wi-Fi (and cellular) traffic at ever expanding scales of bandwidth; i.e. while I don’t have a fridge that talks to the ‘Net, some people do. These people do so in order to replenish food stuffs in that fridge and that type of data usage is going to grow.

Then too, remember the information on IPv6 with its unimaginable number of IP addresses that IPv6 allows as well as the number of embedded RFID chips in nearly everything for tracking, sensing and sharing info – that is going to happen, then what do you think the level of ‘Net traffic is going to be like. Following are more areas that is going to create much more data / voice traffic.

Forward Looking Leaders

We will need more leaders, in multiple industries, who will look further ahead to see what the need will be rather than those leaders who only look 2 – 3 years ahead ‘only’ to meet the revenue and ROI profits of right now.

Being short-sighted with a narrow view of technology and usage will only be limiting and will affect all of us.
Enhanced Wi-Fi capabilities 

We are going to have high and heavy Web and Wi-Fi usage – for many purposes. We will need enhanced Wi-Fi capabilities and capacities to handle the growth of traffic.

More advances continue to occur in this area – and it “ain’t gonna” stop at 802.11 a/b/g/n standards. The capabilities will increase in range and data speeds – we already see increasing use of microcells and femtocells (5 &amp; 6) by wireless providers (AT&amp;T &amp; even Cisco) to offload some of the burden and congestion from the monstrous large cell towers. Micro and Femtocells are hand held sized cubes that can be placed anywhere to boost wireless signals – in the home or at a bus stop or on the side of a building or throughout a conference hall.

As we continue moving forward with more and better (sometimes not) technology, there is going to be much more need and extensive use of bandwidth.

Data backups

There are going to be many, many more firms and home users performing backups across the ‘Net, to the ‘Cloud.’ These entities are going to be performing backups for multiple reasons and they ‘may not’ pay for some dedicated T1 or T3 copper cable or a Fiber Optic line from point A to point B.

Business are going to be doing backups for many critical files, stemming from Personnel (HR), financial, R &amp; D, strategy and other important files.

Home users are going to continue doing backups for their libraries (data – video, pictures and important documents). And with lower cost options from different vendors, more users are going to get into the act and start doing backups.

Many people and firms are doing backups in case of malicious individuals create havoc and ruin the in home PCs and on site servers of the various businesses.

MORE people and MORE firms are going to do backups and file transfers over the ‘Net, whether it is via Wi-Fi or wired – it will all traverse the ‘Net (copper or fiber links).

Illegal activities

What about those illegal usages over the ‘Net, you know, the illicit pornography – no, I’m not referring to the regular permissible porno, I’m talking about the illegal underage, human trafficking and other venues…

What about movie and music pirating from peer to peer networks – you think that is going away? There is going to be more of this, that is, until they are caught performing these illegal actions, either by the RIAA, MPAA, Justice Dept and/or other arms of law enforcement.

You know there is going to be more of this activity as more people get into the digital game of life and take advantage of every part of the ‘Net that they can. There is going to a lot of this activity.

And while not illegal, what about those folks who are data hogs, they suck down vast amounts of data from the ‘Net creating congestion for others. They are not stealing bandwidth but they sure use a great deal of it…

Smartphones, Tablets, HDTV oh my…

As growth continues onward and upward, there will be more people constantly on their smartphones watching videos (or TV or sports).

Think about their being significantly more people using the video calling function on their phones and tablets as the cost of data plans drop (hopefully) in price and more people using their PCs/laptops/tablets to make video calls over something like a Skype – there is going to be more data on the ‘Net, whether it is Wi-Fi, Fiber or cable.

Remember the old cartoons, TV episodes and movie clips of people making those video calls at anytime, anywhere – more people are going to be doing this. As you may have noticed in some of the newer commercials, some of the telcos are continually trying to push their video calling features. Unfortunately, to some like me, the price to use is still too high to just glibly use whenever and wherever…

There will be more HDTV, think 4K HDTV, which requires MUCH more bandwidth. Make no mistake about it; there will be more 4K HD content – soon. And that expensively high cost of owning a 4K HDTV, you know that cost is going to come down and as ever, more people will want it.

Then, what about another possible high bandwidth application, such as vehicle to vehicle(V2V) communications…? Rest assured, V2V is coming as well, as we attempt to make roads and vehicles safer in saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people over the coming years – especially when many of these people who die or cause the death of others should not have been driving in the first place:
◾Drunk drivers
◾Stoned drivers
◾Under-aged and inexperienced drivers showing off (yes, we know this happens because many have done the same thing in their youth – overloaded passengers, trying to impress others, etc.)
◾Angry drivers
◾Older drivers driving far beyond when they should have stopped driving

Whether many of us like it or not, we will have V2V communications in the future, cars talking to other cars/trucks/buses to prevent T-boning or head on collisions because someone was not paying attention… This will add to Wi-Fi/cellular congestion across the country, across the globe in years to come.

You’re going to see more data from devices such as Google Glass, competitor knock offs and other types of recording devices – all sending data to the Cloud. Give it several years and you’ll see… We know that Cloud storage that is available to us regular users is becoming so inexpensive, why not store it in the Cloud. The only real hurdle is the data rate charges, set by the various telco’s out there.

Security Data

More people are going to turn to checking their homes and apartments remotely, while at work, while at the movies or while on vacation. As the quality of IP enabled security hardware, firmware and software continues to improve, more people still will jump on this type of security for peace of mind. And they are going to do more security checking from their smart phones.

Some people, while at work, will have a dedicated web page up all day long to keep an eye on their home for:

– Checking up on the person providing hospice for an older parent or

– Whoever is taking care of their baby or

– Simply to keeping an eye out for whoever is stealing their UPS/FEDEX packages

More companies are going to use IP enabled monitoring for:

– The safety and tracking of their delivery drivers, i.e. to more quickly respond to one of their vehicles being hijacked

– Tracking of assets throughout the long supply chain, to ensure the assets are legit and/or if they are being tampered with

Online Education

For those who are not aware, online learning is going to continue to grow; you need but check out online learning at: Stanford, Coursera, edX, Udacity and Harvard. These are all entities part of the current Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) experiment (my term) but it is likely here to stay. Online education is being expanded at more colleges and high schools and below. 

It is a great use of technology and the ensuing bandwidth utilization is only going to continue upward at an ever increasing curve.

Health care Data

More institutions are going to use IP enabled devices and the ‘Net for ever better purposes in diagnosing, researching and sharing of TERABYTES (if not petabytes and above) during a single session.

For instance, x-ray files are large images to transport across the Internet…

Options for the near future

Flexigrid. This is one item I had not heard about until I read earlier this year one guy’s posting of a link at a web site, which in turn led me to Gizmodo’s article for more info:

The Fastest Real-World Internet Is 1000x Quicker than Google Fiber http://gizmodo.com/the-fastest-real-world-internet-is-1000x-quicker-than-g-1506564949, Jan 22, 2014

UK researchers (BT along with French Alcatel-Lucent) have achieved a network speed of 1.4 TERABITS per second – with commercial grade hardware using a new protocol called Flexigrid. They overlaid seven channels of data in one fiber optic cable with each layer moving 200 Gbps (bits/sec) to achieve that 1.4 Tbps – they called the resulting combination, an “Alien Super Channel”…

From Gizmodo’s article: How fast is 1.4 Tbps? Fast enough to stream any one of the following in one second:
◾64 hours of HD Netflix
◾38 hours in 3D or 4K
◾36,409 songs from Spotify

Or, how about downloading 44 films in a second, from an article in The Independent: www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/fastest-ever-commercial-internet-speeds-in-london-download-44-films-in-a-second-9077061.html.

If we can even realistically obtain half of that monstrous speed in the U.S., it will help tremendously with the congestion and Quality of Experience problems we have throughout the country – in that people will have their data and will be off the ‘Net quicker, something along those lines.

Some of us cannot wait for this tech to be deployed and be put into real use. But, the telco’s are likely to charge an arm and a leg for this new Alien Super Channel as it is called…

Or, how about 100 Gbps Wi-Fi, eh…? That would be something as well. Checkout the article, also at Gizmodo

The World’s Fastest Wi-Fi Makes Google Fiber Look Like Dial-Up, http://gizmodo.com/the-worlds-fastest-wi-fi-makes-google-fiber-look-like-1444857507 Oct 14, 2013 – this is Wi-Fi speeds developed by a joint German team.

Read the more serious KIT (one of the German teams) article as well, World Record: Wireless Data Transmission at 100 Gbit/s, http://www.kit.edu/visit/pi_2013_14082.php Oct 14, 2013.

Compression

Data compression is another tool that can be used. If we utilize more and better data compression schemes to minimize the size of data packets flowing across the ‘Net through all the various routers and switches that will help a great deal. Of course, it will have to be better than what is currently being used today.

Collaboration

Collaboration across many telcos (i.e. Verizon, Sprint), telecom vendors of routers and switches (i.e. Juniper, Qualcomm, Cisco) and other hardware/firmware/software manufacturer/creators has got to occur in order to move the football down the field to that infamous goal post we always hear about.

We need that innovation and collaboration now in order to have a better future for everyone, whether one is in school, at home or businesses trying to be a better entity for their customers.

We need leaders who are willing to convince their shareholders to hold off or forego their dividend checks, while investments are made now to move that football.

 

I am pretty confident there are still better ways to more data across the ‘Net in a more efficient and effective manner but I only wanted to talk up the need for even faster pipes across the Internet…

Now, We Need To Do It Again To Preserve Net Neutrality.","**FINAL EDIT: [The current top thread on r/technology](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/) is rallying exactly the brand of activism I hoped we might see. /u/Antoine3323's [excellent, comprehensive post](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/ch6j7v5) is a better resource than I managed to provide here for contacting the organizations we need to be reaching out to. Please take advantage of this and reach out! (Antoine3323's template is a great jumping off point, but I highly recommend taking a couple minutes to personalize your message and tailor it to your specific audience for a better shot at getting their attention.) That post was made on a thread that /u/SomeKindOfMutant kicked off with a [wonderful call to action](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/ch6e4mb). Everyone who has taken the time to advocate for Net Neutrality, thank you! Keep fighting!**

[The January 18, 2012 blackouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA#Protests_of_January_18.2C_2012) were critical in raising widespread awareness and action against SOPA. If we're going to successfully fight the FCC's new ""fast lane"" rules and preserve Net Neutrality, we're going to need to be able to form that kind of highly visible coalition again.


Free Press is organizing [May 15 protests](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-aaron/wake-up-internet-time-to_b_5207303.html) in D.C., to coincide with Tom Wheeler's scheduled release of the rule-change proposal. That seems like an opportune date for prominent sites to black out to draw attention to the cause (or at the very least, replace their logos with links to the Free Press site for their users to take action).


So don't stop at contacting your [Senators and Representatives](http://contactingthecongress.org) and the [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/contact-us) demanding that broadband be reclassified as a telecommunications service under Title II. Scan the list of participants in the 01-18-12 SOPA strike [toward the bottom of this page](http://sopastrike.com) for sites you frequent, and contact their admins imploring them to black out again on May 15 for Net Neutrality. If you can think of anyone else who's pro-open web who has a highly visible online platform, please contact them as well.


We know Google, Reddit, and the Wikimedia Foundation are all pro-Net Neutrality. If we can push any one of them to replicate what they did to fight SOPA, we can generate millions of petition signatures, as well as calls and emails to Congress and the FCC. Even contacting the writer of your favorite webcomic or high-profile blog has the potential to make a huge difference.


We can stop the internet as we know it from slipping away from us. We can force the federal government to keep it open and competitive. We just need to grow our coalition to get there.


**EDIT 1:** A lot of you are asking for sample letters to send to your elected officials. In addition to a petition you can sign, there are [sample scripts for phone calls to both Congress and the FCC](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do) on the Free Press ""Save the Internet"" page. /u/jkcsblue also provided a [concise sample letter](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4l3cy) if you'd like one.

However, my main hope in creating this thread was for people to go beyond contacting the FCC/Congress and try to tap into the broader audiences held by Reddit and other prominent sites. For instance, it would be incredible if we could get some calls to Netflix going (1-866-579-7172 is their customer service line) asking them to change their logo with a link to the [Free Press Save the Internet page](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do) on May 15. They're a huge player with a massive user base and they stand to lose a lot from this change.


**EDIT 2: [I'm starting a thread below](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4nkec) for people to post who they've contacted and any responses they've gotten. Thank you so much for your support of this cause!**


**EDIT 3:** Some great suggestions for action have been posted.

* /u/SomeKindOfMutant suggests writing a letter to the editor of your local newspaper [that mentions one of your Senators or your Representative by name](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4qnr5). Free Press has tips for writing a letter to the editor [here](http://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/resources/letter-to-the-editor.pdf).
* /u/SuicidalImpulse explains [why the WWE would be a great organization to contact](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4rjgq), and /u/hodaza provides a [contact link](http://www.wwe.com/main-help/contact-us) for them. This is exactly what we're looking for--organizations with a sizable web presence that have a stake in this issue. Not everyone we go after has to be Google or Netflix (though it would be great if we could get their attention too).


**EDIT 4:**

* /u/majesticsteed points out [gaming companies](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch4xgjf) stand to gain a great deal from Net Neutrality. Here's [Valve's contact page](http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php) if anyone wants to request that they put a link to [the Free Press page](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do) in Steam on May 15.
* Those of you pointing out that broader issues such as campaign finance are the real problem, you're not wrong. But eliminating big money in US politics (even just getting us back to a pre-Citizens United level of *relative* sanity), is going to be a vastly larger, longer fight and a free and open web will be an essential tool in that battle.


**EDIT 5:**

From the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/249xs6/the_fcc_has_offered_an_email_address_for_users_to/) currently right above us in this sub:

* Here's a [Whitehouse.gov petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/reclassify-internet-broadband-providers-common-carriers/4MrqLTlV) to reclassify internet broadband providers as common carriers. Please sign it, share it, and recommend that any sites you're contacting post it. Thanks, /u/Qlanger!
* Though the FCC has put up openinternet@fcc.gov as a dedicated email address for input on the May 15 rule proposal, [contacting the FCC commissioners directly](https://www.fcc.gov/contact-us) might be a better way of getting their attention. It certainly can't hurt to do both!


**EDIT 6: Upvoting this and joining the discussion here is great, but please, pick even *one* organization, large or small, that you think would make a good ally on this, go to their contact page, and call/write them asking them to join the May 15 protest. We have the potential to reach an enormous audience here if everyone is willing to pitch in a little.**

**Some suggestions:**

* Ask Netflix to change their logo on May 15 in support of Net Neutrality, and to provide a link to an action page such as [Free Press's](http://www.savetheinternet.com/what-can-i-do). 1-866-579-7172
* Ask [Google](http://www.google.com/contact/) to do the same (though they're more likely to link directly to a public petition), much like they did to fight SOPA.
* Ask [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us_-_Press) to go dark again.
* Ask the [WWE](http://www.wwe.com/main-help/contact-us) to black out their site on May 15.
* Ask [Wired](http://www.wired.com/about/feedback/) to go dark like they did in protest of SOPA.
* Contact [Gawker Media](http://advertising.gawker.com/about/#contact) requesting that they black out their sites or change their logos on May 15.
* Contact [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php) asking them to use Steam to draw attention to the issue. (Other video game companies have a huge stake in this as well--it wouldn't be a bad idea to try Blizzard, for instance.)
* Contact the writer of your favorite blog or webcomic, especially if they [participated in the SOPA protest](http://sopastrike.com).

**This is the future of the internet we're fighting for. Please don't just upvote; take ten minutes out of your day and reach out to someone!**

**EDIT 7:** For those of you wondering what Net Neutrality is, why it's in danger, and how it can be saved: [This page from Free Press](http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-resources), in addition to its calls to action, provides several helpful explanatory links--perhaps most notably [this overview](http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now).

**EDIT 8:** I've been getting questions about what non-US citizens can do to help. US public officials may not be overly concerned with non-citizens' thoughts, but the multinational corporations (such as Netflix, Google, and gaming companies) that are essential to fighting this issue may be receptive to the opinions of their non-American users. Please contact one (or many) of them!

**EDIT 9:** A huge thanks to /u/galenwolf for putting in the time to hunt down a [comprehensive list of contact information](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/ch5ub12) for video game companies that have a huge stake in Net Neutrality.

personalfinance,Student loans refinance/consolidation help,"Hello PF,
I'm looking for some advice with my student loans.  I graduated in 2010 and have since had to awesome opportunity to repay student debt.  A little about myself, 27, making ~$45k/year ~$45k in savings.  Have had recent thoughts of purchasing a home, but I feel like my student debt will not allow me to do so (and may be more important to take care of at this moment).

- 3 Private loans, rates 2.9%-3.15%, totaling ~$29,100
- 5 Federal loans, rates 4.25%-6.55%, totaling ~$15,600

I've never used any of the options for these loans and all are setup for auto pay which gives me ~.25% break on interest.  I've read I cannot consolidate privates with my federals.  Do you have any advice on what to do with these?  I'm not even sure who to contact in order to begin the process.  My current payments are $432/mo and I would love to lower this if possible.

personalfinance,Pay off car loan now or over time?,"Hi r/personalfinance! 

Without going too much into it, I'm in a situation where I'm attempting to separate myself financially from my family. One of the few remaining items to take care of is a car loan that is in both my dad's and my own name. This was done when I bought the car because it reduced insurance rates, but I'm now old enough that this no longer matters. The end goal is to have the title of the car in my name only. I see a few options.

1. Continue to pay the minimum on the loan. Payoff date is in mid 2017.

2. Pay the loan off in full. I have a large enough emergency fund to do this and still have plenty left over. Interest rate on the loan is 2.5%, so common knowledge says to pay the minimum and invest the rest, however, this money would come out of my house fund, which wouldn't touch the market anyway.

3. Reapply for the loan in my name only. This would increase the interest rate to 3%.

I am leaning towards option 2, but am hesitant since this would be a fairly large sum leaving my bank account. Does my thought process seem sound? Any comments or suggestions?",finance,1398720748

personalfinance,"Age 25 with 120K in bank from an inheritance, and I start medical school in the fall. Need advice on loans.","So like I mentioned, I am 25 and have about 120K in the bank already from an inheritance (taxes have already been paid), however starting in August, I will begin medical school at a private university with a tuition of around 40K a year. 

Here are two scenarios I have thought of on how to approach my loan situation and am wondering if anyone could shed some light on this. 

Situation 1: Use the cash I have available and pay off the first couple of months/years of medical school (take the inheritance and stretch it as far as it will go). Then, incur loans based on the residual amount that I will have to pay for the remainder of school + living expenses. 

Situation 2: Take the inherited money and stash it with the goal of saving for retirement (mutual funds/IRA type vehicles). Consequently, I would be assuming loans for 100% of my medical school expenses. 

Initially, situation 1 sounds smart because I am limiting my exposure to about a 5% interest rate on around 300k in loans (that's a rough estimate of the total cost of medical school + living expenses). Effectively I would reduce it down to 180K, and would be able to start paying that smaller principle off during residency. 

However, Situation 2 has been tempting me as of late, because of the idea of compound interest and such. I figure I will have that large sum of money working for me starting at age 25, and by the time I am retiring age (let's say 65), the extra 8-10 years that I have had this money put away will have outweighed the cost of taking out the larger loan principle. I am worried that if I go with situation 1, the opportunity cost of not saving/investing starting at age 25, will hurt me badly. 

Does anyone have experience with a problem like this? Am I dumb to think taking on a higher principle will benefit me in the long run? Any advice appreciated, and thanks ahead of time for any responses.",finance,1398734506

[CONGRESS PERSON NAME HERE]


[ADDRESS OF CONGRESSPERSON]


Dear congressman ____________,

I am writing you today as one of your constituents because I am gravely concerned with the future of our country. In the news there have been recent rumors that the FCC will introduce policies that allow Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to regulate the speeds of data from certain content providers. While ISPs argue this is necessary to offset the increasing costs of connecting their customers to these content providers services, the reality is, this will be used as a weapon to squeeze money out of legitimate businesses, stifle innovation, and unfairly force consumers to ISP ""preferred"" services. Fortunately there is time to do something-- the FCC for the past decade has tried to enforce a concept known as ""net neutrality"", where access to all sites and services is treated fairly and equally-- no sites are sped up, slowed down, or explicitly blocked by the ISP. Unfortunately the Supreme Court determined that the FCC does not have the power or jurisdiction to enforce net neutrality (ironically the commission in charge of regulating communication, lacks the ability to do so). However, this decision does not impact Congress' ability to draft legislation to require 
ISPs to abide by net neutrality rules.

* I propose that Congress should draft legislation that would require Internet Service Providers (e.g. Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T) to abide by the following rules:
Individual sites and services must not have their connection speeds throttled, unless in the event of network issues, throttling must apply to all sites and services equally.
* Access to individual sites and services must not be blocked without consent from the customer (e.g. Parental control filters).


While I have proposed only a few rules, I feel that these rules are necessary to prevent ISPs from shaping the future of our internet-- especially since Comcast and Time Warner cable intend to merge, forming a mega-monopoly of Internet Service. If you draft or support federal legislation of net neutrality, I will remember it during election season.

Sincerely

your constituent,

personalfinance,Grandmother left her house to me (in a trust) with one catch. Help please.,"throwaway account here

My Grandmother named me the conservator of her estate and willed her home to me and my brother to split equally, with one catch. Here are the details:

-Home is worth about $1 million US, in California.
-Our dad gets to live there as long as he likes, this is specified in her will and the trust.
-Our dad has to maintain the house and pay for upkeep and any property taxes or other expenses associated with the house.
-My grandmother passed away about 5 years ago.
-My dad is still alive and well, living in the house.
-My dad has been paying the property taxes, which are still in my grandma's name.

This last point is where I'm a little stuck. **Since grandma is gone. What paperwork or other communication do I need to submit to the county, state or federal government?**

For instance, does the house need to change ownership to the living trust? and the living trust should be paying the property taxes? the living trust probably, technically owns the house. But do I have to notify someone?

This all seems a little sketchy and un-documented. How do I make this right? Ultimately I don't want to lose this valuable asset because of a technicality. Thanks for any help or suggestions you can give us!",finance,1398738025
personalfinance,"I have so many accounts at so many banks, and wondering if I should go to a credit union.","I have bank accounts - one checking and one savings each - with all of the major banks pretty much, something that I didn't mean to do but ended up happening due to a set of circumstances. Lately I've been wondering if I should close them all and go to one of my local credit unions, which seems like a good thing to do at first. I wouldn't have to worry about how much money is in each account, or trying to waive the fees on each and getting angry if I got hit with one (my first paycheck at my new second job came in immediately before another of Chase's maintenance fees, I was so happy).

The way to avoid these fees is especially annoying, I have to split my paychecks up. Citibank is especially annoying, needing a deposit AND a bill payment. I don't like using bill payments through banks, if I need to pay my cable bill I'll do it from their website, not rely on the bank.

However, I have credit cards with these banks too, and I love how I can send a payment immediately to these cards from checking accounts from the same bank. It eases my mind a lot. I wouldn't close the credit cards, that hurts your score and I like the cards, Chase's offering especially.

To be honest, I actually work at a bank, so I'd probably keep the account with them so long as I'm working for them. At least that one's free. I don't want to say which bank not because I'm afraid of people judging me or something, I just value my job. I can say though that if I didn't work for them, I'd close them too (I literally opened the account when I got the job). Regardless, I'd still use the credit union as my main bank, though. What should I do?

Oh, and if there are any Long Islanders or New Yorkers in general that look at this, I'm deciding between Bethpage, Teachers Federal, and Suffolk Federal Credit Unions, leaning mostly toward Bethpage.",finance,1398741438

news,Abney Associates Financial Advisory: Confidence key to emerging markets,"At the beginning of the year, there were three potential areas of asset allocation that very few global portfolio managers wanted to consider seriously. As I travelled around the United States and elsewhere in the world, almost none of our clients wanted to hear about Japan, commodities or emerging markets, [Ameriprise Financial Abney Associates Team](http://ameripriseabneyassociates.wordpress.com/).

So far they have been wrong about commodities, which are a part of my radical asset allocation and have broken out of their trading range and headed higher. The standard of living continues to improve in the developing world, and one of the first things consumers do when their income increases is start to eat better. This means more meat and poultry where grains are used for feed as well as more consumption of grains by individuals. As a result of continuing growth in the developing world and flat to uneven agricultural production because of variable weather, prices for corn, wheat and soybeans have risen.

As for the other two areas of investor disinterest – Japan and emerging markets (both also in my radical asset allocation) – performance this year has been poor. Japan has been hurt by the increase in its sales tax to 8 per cent from 5 per cent in April as well as concern about a weakening Chinese economy.

During March, I travelled to Chile and Colombia in Latin America. In April, I flew to Sydney and Melbourne and Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo. I talked to our clients and knowledgeable observers in these areas. While each region faces challenges, I believe the emerging markets generally present opportunities but it is unclear when investors will start to appreciate them.

[Emerging markets](http://www.afr.com/p/business/companies/confidence_key_to_emerging_markets_rsS0rxuFEp3Bd7X0xuVy3I) have suffered for two reasons. The first is the belief that continued Federal Reserve tapering will cause interest rates in the US to rise and the dollar to strengthen. This would be bad for those whose assets are in emerging market currencies. As a result there has been selling of equities in Asia and Latin America by local and global investors in spite of the fact that growth in those areas is considerably above that in the developed world.

The Russia/Ukraine situation has also had a broad influence in the emerging markets because it has highlighted the second reason for investor concern, the issue of political risk. The governments in many of these countries have only a tenuous hold on the power to influence the future course of [economic growth](https://medium.com/ameriprise-abney-associates/2efc6b971d9b). While Ukraine was never an area of investor interest, Russia’s action there caused concern throughout the developing world.

**KOREAN UNIFICATION**

At this point, I do not believe Putin will move further toward strong military action, although there is much informed opinion on the other side. The new presence in Ukraine of armed gunmen in unmarked uniforms occupying government buildings replicates the situation in Crimea prior to the referendum. If Putin moves to take over eastern Ukraine, I think it would be a strategic mistake for him. The response from the West would be a strong, and the sanctions already imposed have had a negative impact on Russia.

He would be much better off waiting until later or moving very slowly now. Some of Putin’s closest advisors are for cooling the situation down but Russia’s leader is both ambitious and unpredictable. One would be wrong to be complacent about the situation. Ukraine has revived concerns about political instability in the developing world hurting emerging market equities across the board.

During my trip I had an email exchange with my former Morgan Stanley colleague Steve Roach, who was in Asia discussing his book on the rebalancing of the Chinese economy. He and I have been in a dialogue over the last few months about how much the Chinese economy will slow down if the consumer segment becomes the dominant driver of growth rather than credit-driven spending on state-owned enterprises and infrastructure.

Roach believes the economy may not weaken as much as I fear because the service sector is becoming more important and each service sector percentage point of growth generates 30 per cent more jobs than a point of growth in the manufacturing sector. He thinks growth will moderate very gradually and a considerable number of new jobs will still be created each year, reducing the likelihood of social unrest.

One [investor](http://sqworl.com/42afe5) I discussed this with pointed out that it may be true that a percentage point of service sector growth produces more jobs than one in manufacturing, but many pay low wages and may not do a lot to increase the importance of the consumer in the economy.

**CHINA’S POLLUTION PROBLEM**

Several discussions in Beijing yielded insights worth passing on. One investor was concerned about similarities between China now and Japan in the 1980s. During the 1980s numerous books were written about how Japan was doing everything right, with robotics increasing productivity, very strong export growth and soaring real estate values. Japanese technology and consumer electronics stocks were US sharemarket favorites back then. Suddenly it was all over and the Nikkei 225 declined 75 per cent, and today it is trading at 35 per cent of its peak level.

I pointed out some significant differences. China has a population 10 times that of Japan. Its per capita income is one-tenth of that of the US, and by improving its standard of living, China can hope to see its economy grow for a long time, especially if it is successful in shifting the components of growth toward the consumer. Also, China has a centralised government structure that can make decisions quickly and implement them without delay. This is in sharp contrast to the Japanese Diet, where the legislative process can drag on endlessly in a manner similar to the US Congress.

What China must do is deal with its enormous pollution problem. My eyes burned and my throat was sore while I was in Beijing. It was worse on this trip than in previous years. There are reports that 280 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, resulting in high cancer rates. Ground pollution from industrial waste is also a serious problem. The pollution condition must be faced if China expects to have an increasingly important role in the world economy and geopolitics.

Another investor asked me what I would do to get Chinese [consumers](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ameriprise-Abney-Associates/485598604873111) to spend more. I told him that improving the social safety net would help. The Chinese save for the after-school education of their children, healthcare and their retirement. If the government played a greater role in providing services in these areas, perhaps the Chinese would spend more time at the malls.

That change is not likely to come quickly. Some investors are also concerned that the economy is slowing because of a lack of both domestic and export demand, which could reduce job creation, causing problems for the authoritarian government. Most Chinese would want to have a lot of cash on hand if that happened.

**WIDE-RANGING GEOPOLITICAL CONCERNS**

Everywhere I went in Asia, investors were sceptical about their home markets, but Japan was extreme in this respect. Perhaps it was because the Nikkei 225 had a difficult first quarter and is down 14 per cent in yen and 11 per cent in dollars so far this year. In the longer term, the ageing population will cause the work force to peak in the next few years and this would make growth difficult. The country has initiated a guest worker program to mitigate this.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s first two arrows, fiscal and monetary expansion, have produced growth of 1.5 per cent and inflation approaching 2 per cent, achieving two of his objectives. The third arrow, regulatory reform and sustainable growth, requires legislative action and that will be harder to achieve.

Investors wondered why my asset allocation had a 5 per cent position in Japan in the face of all of these problems. My response was Japan was clearly out of favour, few institutions held positions, the [economy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdKe_Sdi6V8) was finally growing and recent data was quite positive. Finally, there were a number of reasonably valued stocks available. I thought the risk of a further decline was low and there was an opportunity to make money from these levels if and when investors turned constructive.

While [monetary growth and bank loans](http://ameripriseabneyassoc.blogspot.co.uk/) have slowed recently, and this may have dampened the enthusiasm of some investors, I believe there is no chance that Prime Minister Abe will let the country slip back into a deflationary recession and another round of stimulus is ahead if it is needed.

In discussions with Asian investors, I addressed their geopolitical concerns, which focused on Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Palestine, the Iran nuclear threat and, particularly, the disputes between Japan and China over islands and fishing rights in the South China Sea. The thrust of their questions was whether the world is on the brink of armed conflict in a number of different places and this would destabilise the markets.

My views on Russia/Ukraine were described earlier. Regarding Iran, I think the sanctions are working and I probably would have demanded that Iran dismantle its centrifuges before offering any relief, but that may have been diplomatically impossible. Now we have to hope that Iran is serious about reducing its nuclear effort; we should have the answer to that in a few months.

Everyone I talk to who is close to the situation is sceptical and reluctant to trust the Iranian government’s commitment, but the people of Iran feel they have been repressed for too long. They want the sanctions lifted so they can participate in the economic opportunity that should emanate from their vast oil resources. The new government in Iran appears ready to respond to the demands of its constituents.

**REASONABLE VALUATIONS**

The Israel/Palestine conflict seems unresolvable. Neither a one-state nor a two-state solution appears possible. The Arab world refuses to acknowledge Israel’s right to exist and Israel refuses to reduce the settlements in territory it feels is legitimately part of Israel. Even US Secretary of State John Kerry is frustrated by his inability to make progress there.

As for the South China Sea, which is so important to that region, I am hopeful that a diplomatic solution can be reached. China is very proud of its military progress, but is more concerned with the growth of its economy and not anxious to be distracted by armed conflict with anyone at this time, in my opinion. Perhaps I am naïve in thinking hostilities are not going to take place in any of the major trouble spots in the near term, but over the past decade I think everyone has learned how little has been gained by going to war.

Investors were concerned that the recent sharp decline in the technology, social media and biotechnology stocks signaled the end of the bull market or even the bursting of a bubble in equity prices that began with the market’s rise in 2009. After all, they reasoned, stocks have been rising for most of the past five years and that is the usual duration of a positive cycle. I pointed out that valuations were still reasonable at 16 times forward operating earnings and the US economy was expected to pick up momentum after the brutal weather of the first quarter.

The present multiple of the market is about equal to the long-term median. The previous bull market that ended in 2007 reached a multiple in excess of 20 times and the frothy dot.com market which ended in 1999 had a peak multiple in excess of 30 times.

I still believe the US economy will move toward real growth of 3 per cent and the S&amp;P 500 will turn in a strong performance before year-end. The stocks that have been hit hardest are the big winners of the past year where investors did not want to see their profits melt away. This has been true of the exchange-traded funds of the favoured sectors where selling has been particularly furious, resulting in sharp liquidation of the underlying stocks.

Asian [investors](https://plus.google.com/b/101882314057525811182/101882314057525811182/about) were focused on the tapering by the Federal Reserve, which has hurt the emerging markets and many wonder if it will continue. My response was that it will as long as the US economy is growing above 2 per cent, but it might be suspended for a while if the pace falters. As for Europe, there was concern about deflation, but I said that it looked like growth in the euro zone would be 1 per cent in 2014 and that diminished the deflation threat.

The mood in Asia was clearly subdued even though the economies there seem to be doing reasonably well. The International Monetary Fund estimates world growth for 2014 at 3.6 per cent, the US at 2.8 per cent, the euro zone at 1.2 per cent and emerging markets at 4.8 per cent. With the developing world growing so much faster than its mature brethren, you would think there would be opportunities there.

What is needed is renewed confidence on the part of local investors and a willingness to put money into their home market. Right now they are pulling money out. One attitudinal difference between Asian investors I talked with and their American counterparts is their fear that a geopolitical event will send equities tumbling everywhere. American investors are more complacent. I certainly hope the Asians are wrong.",finance,1398750294
dogecoin,ZIMBAWE No longer has a national currency .maybe they should adopt DOGECOIN,"By Bernard Mpofu
Acting Business Editor

Presenting the Monetary Policy Statement in Harare yesterday, acting Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Charity Dhliwayo said Treasury had no immediate plans to re-introduce the local currency.

Before this latest policy intervention, the multi-currency basket was dominated by the United States dollar, South African rand and Botswana pula.

The move could signal a gear up in government’s look-east policy which was adopted more than a decade ago after Harare fell out of favour with the European Union and the United States due to alleged gross human rights violations and failure to uphold the rule of law.

“Trade and investment ties between Zimbabwe, China, India, Japan and Australia have grown appreciably. It is against this back ground of growth in trade and investment ties that in the 2014 National Budget, the Minister of Finance and Economic Development underscored the importance of including other currencies in the basket of already circulating currencies,” Dhliwayo said.

“In this regard, we wish to advise exporters and the general transacting public that in addition to the opening of accounts denominated in Botswana Pula, British Pound Sterling, Euro, South African Rand, United States Dollar, individuals and corporates can also open accounts denominated in the Australian Dollar (AUD), Chinese Yuan (CYN), Indian Rupee (INR) and Japanese Yen (JPY).”

The use of the multi-currency regime was credited with stemming hyperinflation which had made the local currency worthless.

Turning to the capitalisation status of local financial institutions, the central bank acting governor also announced a reprieve for banking institutions after postponing the deadline for the ongoing capitalisation exercise to 2020. Banks were in June expected to raise $100 million in core capital amid concerns that predominantly locally-owned lenders were struggling to meet the new threshold.

“Capital requirements remain at current levels of $25 million for Commercial Banks, $25 million for Merchant Banks, $20 million of Building Societies, $15 million for Discount and Finance Houses and $5 million for Microfinance Banks. Nevertheless, compliance with Cabinet-approved levels has now been moved to 31 December 2020,” Dhliwayo said.",cryptocurrency,1398752137

I would be embarrassed picking up a girl in it. Thus I am in the market for a new car (2014 Altima for ~$19,500 with college grad program) or a used Jeep Wrangler for ~15k. 
* My parents agreed cover my health insurance until I am 26 and will cover my cellphone/car insurance until then too. Thankfully I am lucky in this regard.
* I created a skeleton budget ($750/mo rent, $150/mo utilities, $200/mo for clothing, $300/mo for groceries and toiletries, $350/mo car payment (60 month financing), $300/mo student loan payment, $500/mo for booze, concert tickets, hobbies, and eating out). This leaves me with roughly 1200/mo left over to put into savings or to start investing.

They want to do a ""90% cash out"" refinance on my existing house, roll the cost of the new property into that and go to 90% of the combined value. They're offering a combined loan financing both properties on one loan as a 30 year mortgage at 4.75% (biweekly, no mortgage insurance).

This sounds vague to me, but when I googled 90% cash out loans I saw a lot of articles on the subject and my eyes glazed over.

I need a dumb person's explanation.

Some dumb person questions:

- What would my down payment / total out of pocket cost be to go forward with this? My mortgage broker said something vague like the loan would contribute $89k towards the $130k property and I'd need to come up with the rest, so... $41k down payment out of pocket from me? I'm not really quite getting this. I need a breakdown.

- What exactly would my equity in both properties be when all is said and done?

- How can I calculate the monthly payment? (I don't expect the payment to be beyond my means, I just want to know what the number is likely to be so I can go into this informed.)

- Should I be worried about the biweekly payments instead of monthly for any reason? Is no mortgage insurance good or bad? I don't even know what mortgage insurance is.

- What are the pros and cons of what the bank is offering? Any gotchas that may not have occurred to me? (Aside from the interest rate going up.)",finance,1398794326

I just graduated and got a great job making 56k per year and am doing a rotational position so i need to move from Michigan to Cali  ( in June) and then from Cali to ATL in December. I am paid for these moves 3k each move.

My current car will not make the drive and doesn't have air bags. I can not take it across the country. I am wondering if it would be wise to take out a loan and spend 12-15k on a 2010+ Rav 4 or similar style or just spend 5kish and get a much more used car?

My budget for 6 months is as follows
Salary 56k - 6% match - Taxes = approx 39k or 2834 per month.
If this is off please advise.

Rent - 650 per month ( will be subleasing and paying 500ish + bills)

economy,Why couldn't the government just pay us off?,"I'm not an economist, but I try to understand it as best as I can.  I have an idea to solve the unemployment crisis and recession, and would like to know what you think.  

Let's assume wealth is largely virtual (not backed by hard assets such as gold, or even other commodities or services), and that currency is based on its perceived value alone.   

In this case, the value of a dollar is an abstraction.  Its worth as much as we want to believe its worth.  As long as people are willing to believe the dollar has value, they'll keep trading, spending and saving in dollars.

By extension, it shouldn't matter how in debt we are, because so long as people think there's a chance to pay it back (even if takes centuries) then they'll keep lending, investing, etc.  

Furthermore, if the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve (or whatever entity could do this) just agreed to give everyone in the country a set amount of money (say for example, $500,000) why not?

I'm a long term unemployed, two (going on three) degree college graduate.  I'll complete my degree in the healthcare industry in about a year.  I've had a lot of time on my hands.  I can read the writing on the wall.  I know we're in a new Gilded age, and that the divide between the rich and the poor threaten to undo this nation.

I'm going to be unleashed in an unforgiving, discriminatory job market, with no paid experience.  I don't just speak for myself, but untold thousands of my peers that face the same long odds that I do.  We may not show it, but many of us are angry, confused, dejected.  If something doesn't turn around to give us hope, so we can start our careers and our lives, there's going to be a boiling point.

What if the United States could save itself from another Civil War, or a second revolution, if they would just implement a guaranteed basic income?  Or a one time substantial cash infusion?  We could stimulate the economy, fortify ourselves against the next recession, pay down our debts, feel like we can breathe again.

If it is economically possible, isn't it time for the working classes to get a piece of the action, if it might prevent the death of millions of people or a violent overthrow?  Or legions of the country dropping out of the system and living on the fringe?",finance,1398803966

This isn't even including the [$2,644,678.00 in PAC spending](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00248716&amp;cycle=2014) by Comcast so far this year.  [(Where that $2m went.)](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cmte=C00248716&amp;cycle=2014)  For an explanation on why this isn't corrupting and why money is speech and why corporations are people I would encourage you to look up Citizens United vs FEC, 2011.

If you want to get money out of politics you have some options for getting involved:

Getting money out of politics ([and why it's important that we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kHACjrdEY)):

 * [Move to Amend](https://www.movetoamend.org/)  *""We, the People of the United States of America, reject the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United and other related cases, and move to amend our Constitution to firmly establish that money is not speech, and that human beings, not corporations, are persons entitled to constitutional rights.*""

 * [Represent.us](https://represent.us/) seeks to pass a law ending corruption in politics by way of ""[The American Anti-Corruption Act](http://www.anticorruptionact.org/)"" which would end lobbying, mandate transparency for PACs and SuperPACs as well as imposing spending limits on political action committees.  (**Thanks to /u/Battlingdragon for the URL correction**)
 
Tracking money in politics:

 * [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/)  *""OpenSecrets.org is your nonpartisan guide to money's influence on U.S. elections and public policy. Whether you're a voter, journalist, activist, student or interested citizen, use our free site to shine light on your government.""*
 
Electoral reform:

 * [FairVote.org](http://www.fairvote.org)  *""FairVote educates and empowers Americans to remove the structural barriers to achieving a representative democracy that respects every vote and every voice in every election.""*

------
I would suggest that you call up your representative and express your feelings on Net Neutrality (Even if your representative *isn't* on this list) and explain that you're a voter, you're politically active and how s/he votes and acts on Net Neutrality or the Comcast/TWC merger will effect your voting and donations in the future.

personalfinance,Everyone's favorite - student loan questions,"Hi PF,

I received a pre-screen in the mail today offering to *refinance* my private student loans.  The rates in the fine print are still better than what I pay now, so I come asking if this is a ""gimme"" or I am missing something here.  I have two private student loans which I will detail below.

Here is some background on my current financials:

**Assets:**

* Salary: $54,000
* Savings: ~$18,000
* 401k: ~$20,000

**Expenses:**

&gt; * **Student Loan #1**
&gt; * Principle: $22,900
&gt; * Interest: 5.75% variable (I believe 3 month libor)
&gt; * Monthly payment: $180

&gt; * **Student Loan #2**
&gt; * Principle: $24,600
&gt; * Interest: 5.66% variable (I believe 3 month libor)
&gt; * Monthly payment: $240

Total Monthly Expenses: **$1600**

This includes student loans, car payment, and rent + other spendings - I don't carry a credit card balance ever.

Monthly Takehome/Savings (*after expenses*): **$1160**
 ----
 
 
 
With the pre-screen I received, they are offering *refinancing* with the following rates:

10 year terms

**Fixed rate:** 5.24 to 6.99%

**Variable rate:** 1 Month Libor + 2.75-5.00% (MAX RATE, regardless of Market: 8.95% - My current loans do not have a cap that I know of).

No prepay penalty, origination fees, application fees, etc. You also get .25% rate reduction for AutoPay, which I would do (my current loans described above already have that discount factored in).

My credit score is mid 700s, so my real questions are:

1) Assuming the rates are indeed lower than what I pay now, is this worth considering?  

2) How important would locking into a fixed rate be?  At this point I am leaning towards the variable rate.  I will hopefully have enough saved up to pay this off in 2-3 years plus it is capped reasonably low.  As it stands now both my loans are already variable rate (higher) and the lenders are taking more off the top from the libor index.

3) After putting aside 5k for emergency purposes, would it be a good idea to dump my remaining savings ($13k) into one of my loans, regardless if I do this refinancing?  

4) Does anyone know if they would give me a lower rate if I refinanced/consolidated a higher total balance?  My thought here would be to not throw any savings towards either loan until after I refinance and get in with a potentially lower rate, THEN put it in.  Good idea, bad idea, or does it not matter?

I know people often say refinancing in general is a bad idea, but if I put down ~13k towards student loan #1, and then I can refinance under a lower variable rate, paying LESS monthly, would that not be worth doing?  If you think Fixed rate is the way to go in this situation please let me know.

Oh, one last piece of info: Both of these student loans were *originally* 10 year termed loans, but due to negligence they accumulated interest while in school and *just now* are under their original amounts (After being out of school for 4 years, and yes I've paid off about 60k in OTHER student loans already).  With current/minimum payments these will be paid off by 2026 and 2027 (so... more than 10 years from now).

I am not going to pull the trigger on anything until I give it more thought, but wanted people's advice on whether refinancing these now is a good idea. 

Thanks in advance for your help, and reading.

TL:DR - Is it worth refinancing (and possibly consolidating?) two private student loans into what looks like lower variable interest rates?  Is it worth sticking with a fixed rate, even if its not much lower than my current?  Should I dump savings into either loan before or after refinancing?",finance,1398811844

personalfinance,Invest or pay off student loans?,"Hi r/pf.  First time posting here so please let me know if I do anything wrong... as far as I can tell this seems to follow the rules..

So I got married about 6 months ago and my wife has student loans while I do not.  She is paying them off fairly quickly and currently has a total of about 10k remaining at an average interest rate of 5% (or so).  We make decent money for our young age (100k+ combined/year) and I'm trying to figure out the best way to spend some money we have saved up and received from our wedding.

I have determined that we have easily 10k to spare at this moment in time so it seems funny that that is the exact amount of debt my wife still has.  That being said I am very interested in buying some shares in a mutual fund (specifically this one https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0540&amp;FundIntExt=INT the admiral shares at vanguard) in hopes that in 5 years or so we can make some money off that to put towards a down payment on a house.

I figured hey, maybe Reddit can help here and I looked through a few other posts and the subreddit seems helpful.  I am leaning towards the investment but I haven't done any hard math and am unsure as to what the typical route to take is in these scenarios.  Just as an aside I am planning on buying a new car soon, but that should have no effect on our financial stability/situation.

Thanks!",finance,1398819764
personalfinance,2nd credit card balance transfer with 9K left. Good idea or no?,"Hey pf,

I'm a 24 year old graduate student who had 8.5K in Mastercard credit card debt at 29.9% APR in May 2013. I had a 12 month 0% APR balance transfer to a Visa card and unfortunately had to rack up another 4K in debt over that summer before I could start paying it down.

Fastforward a year later: the 4K of high-interest Mastercard is paid down; I only make one charge of about $100 per month on it to maintain use. Debt on the Visa card is just under 9K. My question is whether it would be a good idea to put in another 0% balance transfer to avoid the interest rate that kicks in next month. I have a plan worked out to have the card paid off by September.

For reference, I currently have three credit cards. The third one I barely use, so just ignore that one. Would a fourth one really be that big of a deal? I want to maintain perfect credit, but I REALLY don't want to be paying 18-20% on this Visa card over the next 5 months.",finance,1398821639
dogecoin,Any MathShibes here? I need some help/advise :(,"Wasn't sure of any other good sub to ask this in, so here goes


I need some advice on math. I keep failing my classes and I am quickly running out of money to keep taking them (lost federal aid because of failures and my college doesnt accept dogecoin :&lt; ).

The reason I keep failing isn't because I don't know the material. I know all the formulas and how to actually compute the answer. I keep getting problems wrong and failing assignments because I keep screwing up basic math like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Even after checking my work 3 times on my last test, I got a 45% on it due to somehow getting -60 out of -20 * -3

I'm so frustrated because I am tired of college and would much rather get a full time job doing what I want to do instead of wasting time and money failing classes.

dogecoin,Let's fund Alexis Ohanian's billboard to support net neutrality! Let's start a movement to protect internet freedom!,"Alexis Ohanian is trying to preserve net neutrality by planting a huge billboard in FCC's backyard. I think dogecoin community should support this project and also potential future projects regarding the freedom of the internet.

[From here you can find more detailed description of the project and dogecoin donation address](https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/save-net-neutrality-billboard-in-fccs-backyard/description)

**For those who don't know:**

**FCC** is The Federal Communications Commission that regulates interstate and international communications, so these guys have huge influence over how the internet works. 

On the other hand **net neutrality** is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication [wikipedia].

Basically FCC would like make it possible for ISPs to charge their customers for more high priority traffic. For example Netflix could buy this service from ATT to ensure seamless streaming of their content. At the same time traffic from those who don't pay gets slower. While at first glance this may not seem a bad idea, I strongly feel that this is fundamentally against the egalitarian nature of the internet where everybody has the opportunity to prosper.

**This is where we come in.**

The dogecoin has always been about giving the chance to and encouraging those who are willing to try. I mean look at us, there is growing number of entrepreneurs, artists, charities and now even athletes among our community who have started small and are persistently pushing forward to see their dream come true. I believe in these hard working guys and gals and I want to ensure that we have an environment in the future that lets new people to shine without having a huge capital.

**Pros:**

* This is relatively affordable, only 10k$ left 
* There is already dogecoin donation address set up - (check linked website above)
* We have the perfect opportunity to show the core values of the dogecoin and doge community to the whole internet!
* Target audience for internet freedom and dogecoin have significant overlap

I see this as a **huge potential to start an internet wide movement** against giving more power to the resourceful and rich. Remember how big the campaign against SOPA was? This could be as huge and I would like to see doge leading the front lines.",cryptocurrency,1398847244
investing,Elliott Management's Paul Singer just sent a chilling letter to clients. Thoughts??,"AMERICA’S LIABILITIES

The budget deficit for the latest fiscal year (which ended on September 30) was reported to be around $700 billion. However, this figure would be many times higher if the government’s unfunded entitlement programs were included. Even before taking into account liabilities stemming from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which cannot even be calculated yet because so many of its assumptions are either erroneous or outright fabrications, and because many of its provisions keep getting delayed by the Administration for purposes of political advantage, the present value of the future obligations of the federal government is currently around $92 trillion. These obligations have been growing by over 10% per year since 2000, during which time nominal GDP has risen just 3.8% per year. At this rate, the federal government will owe an estimated $200 trillion on the entitlement programs by 2021 (again, excluding the effects of ACA) and $300 trillion by 2025.

These numbers are not fantasies. At present, there is no acknowledgement by a large portion of the American political establishment that this insolvency even exists. Nor have the leaders of this establishment made any concrete progress toward restoring solvency by taking up serious proposals to rein in unpayable promises. Quite the contrary: Politicians and policymakers continually tell people that such entitlement obligations will be met – a claim they must know cannot possibly be true.

Recently, we had a conversation with a mainstream economist who told us that the government is not actually insolvent because the long-term entitlements are not really liabilities that need to be counted, any more than the military budget for the year 2030 needs to be counted. This assertion is incorrect. Military spending, like any other form of discretionary spending, can be cut quickly and arbitrarily, as Washington recently made clear. And such spending is in exchange for goods and services delivered at the time the money is spent. In 2030, the government can buy many more tanks, or many fewer, than it is buying today. It has not promised to buy any amount. In fact, aside from military entitlements such as veterans’ health care, there is no obligation to spend any money at all on the military in 2030. By contrast, entitlements represent concrete governmental promises that are being made today about future spending – promises on which people are being (falsely) told that they can rely. And at the time the money is scheduled to be delivered, the recipient is delivering no goods or services. Only someone who has never run a business could say with a straight face that such obligations are not really liabilities and need not be included in the accounting.

High inflation (or hyperinflation) is one way that devious or clueless policymakers attempt to deal with unpayable promises. It is devious, because without formally imposing a tax, it takes money from savers and investors and pays it to borrowers and voters. It is clueless, because the cycle of government handouts and demands for more benefits is like a game of “chase the tail” – because it dissipates the real value of promised benefits, it brings the ultimate prize no closer while destroying the value of money and dissolving societal cohesion in the process.

The U.S. is in a “warm-up” phase on this score at present. The promises made by U.S. politicians are huge. Absent reform, they will lead to societal ruin. But so far, there has been no collapse of the dollar – possibly because there is no alternative fiat currency against which it can collapse. Gold is trading at $1,300 per ounce, not $5,000 per ounce. The $100 million co-op apartment in New York and the £100 million flat in London are thought of as oddities, not “coming attractions” for the evaporation of the value of paper money. Wage inflation is small (even though labor markets for desirable skills are tighter than most people think), and the arithmetic of government statistics (jobs, growth and inflation) is distorted and dishonest almost beyond measure.

There is something missing in investors’ reasoning that leads to their current complacency, and that is an understanding of the circularity of confidence in a fragile system. Since the system is fundamentally unsound, all it would take is a loss of confidence to set off a collapse in the purchasing power of money, a major currency or the global stock and/or bond markets. “Risk off” today still means buying U.S. Treasuries, but this may not be the case at some unpredictable but abrupt future turning point in market psychology. Markets are fast and self-reinforcing today, creating facts rather than reflecting them. We believe investor confidence today is unjustified. The leaders of the Developed World have chipped away at the solidity that would ordinarily justify confidence in their leadership, markets and currencies, such that confidence can be lost at any moment. If confidence in a sound system is unfairly lost, then countertrend forces can act to stem the panic and restore stability. But a justified loss of confidence in an unsound system would generate much more damage and be, for a period of time and price, unstoppable. That result is what governments have risked by their poor policies, their lack of attention to the risks posed by the inventions of the modern financial system, and their neglect of the fiscal balance sheet. Since this combination is relatively new, particularly the enormity of Developed World debt and obligations, as well as the complexity and extraordinarily high leverage of the financial system (especially given the size of derivatives books), there is no way to tell exactly how it all will end. Badly, we guess.

KE=1/2*M*V2

For those who did not recognize the above formula, you are in good company. It is the equation showing that kinetic energy is a function of mass and velocity, but that the relationship is not linear: A doubling of velocity causes a quadrupling of kinetic energy.

What is the relevance to financial markets and trading? We believe some of the same elements are present when financial leverage rises beyond certain levels. Any complex portfolio contains expectations about maximum expected price movements and possible losses, together with assumptions about the dispersion of returns and correlation. Obviously when markets turn adverse, if those assumptions turn out to be overly optimistic, then losses ensue. Capital represents a cushion against losses, a cushion that is very important to the investor, but even more important to the system as a whole. When leverage goes up, it takes smaller and smaller perturbations in prices, correlations and volatility to generate serious losses requiring palliative action. But as leverage increases among key market players, the possibility of large losses and involuntary liquidation behavior creates contagion from one player to another, a kind of chain-reaction effect as losses occur too quickly for reflection and sellers become price-insensitive, causing larger losses – and even failure – to spread from one firm to another. Extreme leverage removes the cushion and the robustness of structure, and it is the proximate cause of disequilibrium. As with kinetic energy, excessive leverage is nonlinear, subject to tipping points, and can cause (and did cause in 2008) massive and abrupt systemic failure.

This nonlinearity of leverage is a function of similar positioning and contagion. We do not believe that the system today is any safer than it was when it failed in 2007 and 2008. Global leverage is up, not down, contrary to the popular misconception. Private debt is unchanged from 2007 levels, but public debt has risen globally from $70 trillion to $100 trillion. It appears that a number of major American financial institutions have de-risked  themselves somewhat, although this is impossible to discern from publicly available filings (which is why rumor and conjecture will govern the way markets perceive large financial institutions in the next market crisis). European financial institutions still maintain more leverage and bigger derivatives books than their American counterparts, as well as large holdings of sovereign debt that they were coerced into buying as part of the “save-the-euro” panic.

In fact, the global financial system is arguably less safe than it was in 2008. The unquestioned creditworthiness of the Developed World governments ended the most intense phase of the 2008 crisis, as the financial system was ultimately all but guaranteed by governments. A catalyzing force for the next crisis might be a failure of confidence in one or more of those major governments or in China. Such a failure alone could cause major stress in markets, as either currencies or bond markets could experience sudden collapses. Also potentially impactful is one of the major lessons of 2008: It is wise to move assets and sell claims and securities immediately if a debtor or counterparty is perceived to be in trouble. This maxim could make the next market crisis play out on a hair-trigger, with a stressful lead-in and then a simultaneous rush to the exits.

Those who think the scenario above is an exaggeration should ask themselves the following question: After decades of advancements in human knowledge and purported innovations in the global financial system, why did 2008 turn into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression? The answer is that the system was unsound, largely due to excessive leverage and the complexity of financial instruments. In the 80-plus years since the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression, there clearly have been a large number of geopolitical and financial events, yet none of them caused financial collapse until 2008. Of course, we understand that a combination of public and private errors and misconceptions led to the financial crisis, but it was the unfettered use of leverage that made the episode pass over the line into systemic collapse.

We do not think policymakers have learned anything much from the financial crisis, but that fact can truly be demonstrated only as time passes. In our view, monetary policy extremism has papered over (no pun intended) the lack of fundamental reforms that would enable the Developed World to grow faster and more sustainably with financial institutions that are solid and robust enough to withstand the next periods of economic and financial stress. We believe the world’s financial institutions are still essentially dependent on governments, but the Developed World governments themselves are hopelessly insolvent. The insolvency may not be manifested in a market reaction tomorrow or even next year, but the numbers are obvious and compelling, not conjectural or  fanciful. Markets focus on something when they want to, not when “visionaries” think they should.

It is important to note that mass human behavior cannot be modeled or predicted with any degree of precision. When forces are brought to bear that suggest a possible shift in direction of mass human behavior (examples include oppression, tyranny, economic underperformance, inflation, incentives and disincentives), there is no way of telling if, how or when such forces will actually result in a change of vector.",finance,1398854408

I modeled a future refi in 2017 with an interest rate shock and realized that if rates at that time got beyond 8% I might have trouble meeting debt service requirements.

Big investors have access to interest rate swaps but I'm not in that league. Nor do I feel comfortable in my ability to play the options or futures market correctly. My questions are:

1. Is there some sort of accessible and reasonably priced financial product for smaller investors like me to guard against big interest rate hikes? I need this to kick in at a specific point in time when I refi, not be continuously available.

2. If interest rates do climb, what will happen to property values? Simple logic predicts that they will stagnate or tumble because the cost of debt will be higher, but there are other factors such as inflation and GDP growth that may play in. Do you have any insights?

3. Is there any way as a real estate investor to take advantage of predicted rate rises? For example if there is likely to be a wave of commercial defaults in the late 2010s, a smart investor could hold onto liquid capital to snap up some bargains.

What You NEED to Know about the Wealth Inequality Debate 

by Bill Bonner, Chairman, Bonner &amp; Partners

 Bill Bonner Gualfin, Argentina 

Wednesday, 30 April 2014 

Dow up another 86 points. Can anything stop it? 

Yes. We're just waiting to find out what. 

We began this series with a question: Isn't it possible the same savants who now presume to address the problem of wealth inequality were those most responsible for causing it? 

The question arose as we discussed a publishing sensation: Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. As you will recall, the book – all 700 pages – was recently number one on the Amazon.com bestseller list. 

Whoever heard of an economics tome that sold so well? The reason, we suspect, is that the book tells us something that a lot of people were waiting to hear.

Who are the 30% Dividend Companies?

Why isn't anyone talking about THE most outrageous dividends in the public markets? Dividends so large and so safe you could, quite literally, live off of them. 

Click here for the full details.

Criminals, Chiselers and Con Artists

Piketty's gripe, as near as we can determine, is that the rich get richer – especially when economic growth rates are low. And that capitalism can lead to extreme wealth inequality. 

Economic growth rates have been trending downwards for the last 40 years or so. And the average annual wage, adjusted for inflation, has stagnated. But Piketty claims the average annual rate of return on capital (from profits, rents, dividends, interest, royalties, etc.) has remained robust. As a result, private capital has grown as a percentage of national income. And, the rich have gotten richer. Of course, there are many reasons for this – some innocent, others corrupt. 

We will not bother with the innocent ones. Criminals, chiselers and con artists are more revealing and entertaining. And just to make it more interesting, we will name names. In the 1970s – after President Nixon moved the world onto a purely fiat-based money system – the US economy was kissed by the magic of easy credit. 

Poof! 

It was transformed from a handsome prince... into a toad. It used to be an economy where people earned money by making things for people who could afford to buy them. It became an economy of people who lent money to people so they could buy things they didn't need with money they didn't have. 

Piketty thinks he is criticizing capitalism. But after the 1970s, real capital played a smaller and smaller role. It was replaced by credit and its sinister twin: debt. 

The r in Piketty's now famous annotation r &gt; g (where r stands for the average annual rate of return on capital and g stands for the rate of economic growth) is supposed to represent the return on capital investment. 

But where did the wad come from? 

Savings rates went down. Real earnings went down. Growth rates went down. So how could there be more capital available and how could it produce higher rates of return (compared to economic growth)? 

Distortions and Delusions

The whole thing is a headache for a thoughtful man. Capital investments with no real capital behind them. Profits that outstrip the economic growth from which they must come. 

What to make of it? 

We don't dispute the basic fact: that the rich are getting richer. And that they are doing so by getting their hands on capital (something we believe is a damn good idea, especially for anyone hoping to build serious wealth). 

For years, we've been complaining about the distortions caused by central banks. Rewarding the asset-owning classes (the rich) is just one of them. You could add: creating market bubbles, depressing middle-class incomes, increasing debt levels, misallocating resources to worthless, wealth-destroying activities, allowing government to avoid serious budget control, financing monster houses coast to coast... and our own personal favorite – putting dorky economists in positions of immense power and status. 

And now we even have dorky economists with No. 1 bestselling books. What next? 

Revolution! At least, that is what you might think if you listen to Piketty. He thinks r will continue to outpace g. And the natives will get restless. 

The ""market economy, if left to itself, contains powerful forces of convergence in the distribution of wealth,"" he explains. But ""it also contains powerful forces of divergence, which are potentially threatening to democratic societies and to the values of social justice on which they are based."" 

A State Based on Fraud

Once again, Piketty misunderstands the modern, democratic state. It is not based on real social justice. It is based on fraud. 

The masses are told they control the government. And although the masses busy themselves with reading the newspapers, arguing about Obamacare and voting, the elites profit from bailouts, zero-interest-rate policies, subsidies, tariffs, sweetheart loans – you name it. 

That is how the rich really got so rich... with the eager connivance of the authorities. 

And now Piketty concludes that the forces of ""divergence"" (of wealth) are likely to be much more powerful in the 21st century and that someone needs to do something about it. 

Who? The same authorities who distracted the public while the elites picked their pockets! 

Until 1968, the Fed was required to maintain 25 cents worth of gold for every dollar in circulation. Then in 1968, under President Johnson, that requirement was scrapped. Thenceforth, there was no limit to the amount of cash and credit in the system. 

In 1971, under President Nixon, the US reneged on its commitment to pay off foreign-held debt in gold. Now, there was no limit to the amount of debt Americans could run up abroad. Instead of paying their bills in gold, they could just pay in dollars, which are essentially more debt instruments (although with zero maturity). 

In 1987... and again in 2000... Alan Greenspan showed that the Fed would not permit a serious correction. When a credit contraction threatened, the Fed came up with more credit on easier terms. 

By 2007, under the leadership of Ben Bernanke, the Fed was fully committed to credit expansion forever. Milton Friedman had convinced Bernanke that the Great Depression was caused by a shrinking supply of money and credit. Bernanke saluted Friedman with: ""We won't do it again."" Thanks to these numbskulls – and many others – real capital disappeared from the capitalist system. It was replaced by what Sisson called ""a fictitious money"" causing a ""monstrous aberration."" 

That is what we live with today. It was caused by the feds. They will continue making it worse... until the whole dreadful system blows up. 

Regards,



Bill

Market Insight:
Were the Last 100 Years a ""Once Off""? 

From the desk of Chris Hunter, Editor-in-Chief, Bonner &amp; Partners

Piketty's book has, you might say, ""hit a nerve."" Especially his call for a global tax on capital.

An insight that has been garnering less attention: The last 100 years of economic history may have been a ""once off."" 

Piketty argues that a succession of unique events – the Bolshevik Revolution, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold War – destroyed a lot of capital in the 20th century. And that the post-World War II baby boom and the entry of women into the workforce (growth in the working population) plus big increases in productivity did a lot to boost real economic growth. 

As a result, there weren't high levels of inequality between 1945 and the 1970s, when real economic growth started to fall again... and the Fed took over the task of creating ""demand"" by encouraging the Americans to take on more credit. 

The White House, Congress, the Fed – and most investors – have a hard time coming to grips with this tectonic shift. Whisper it, but economic growth rates of 10%... 5%... even 3% may not be ""normal."" 

Take a look at the chart below. It shows the real (inflation-adjusted) annual GDP growth rate in the US going back to 1935. 

http://imgur.com/Tys4Qu9

Source: multpl.com

As you can see, America's real annual GDP growth has been slowly, but surely, ""tapering off"" from highs of 8+% in the 1960s to the sub-3% rate today. 

The average real economic growth rate over the period was 4.4%. The US economy is currently growing at 43% below that level. And that's with the tailwind of the Fed's QE and ZIRP. 

Looking out ahead, you can forget the tailwinds of big growth in the labor force. And productivity growth over the last five years has been 42% lower than it was in the 1945-1973 period. 

Barring a big surge in productivity, something closer to 1% real annual US GDP growth over the next 20 years or so wouldn't be at all surprising.

personalfinance,Unlimited 401K match?,"Hi pf!
I will be a new college grad this spring and I already received a job offer.  I think the hardest part for me is understanding the benefits, since I never really had to deal with this stuff before.  I get most of them but I have one in particular.  The 401K plan is as follows:

* Employees may contribute up to 75% of pre-tax pay per pay period, not to exceed annual federal maximums. 
* The Company may match 25% of each dollar contributed to the plan, after a 6 month waiting period. 
* All 401(k) contributions, The Company match and earnings, are 100% vested immediately. 

Is this good or bad?  Obviously, no limit is a good thing, but they only match 25 cents to the dollar, which is bad if I don't contribute a lot, correct?
