investing,Buy/Hold Investing Strategy Is No Longer Viable,"Firstly I would like to say that this subreddit has helped me tremendously over the past several years. I've learned SO much about investing... but I've come to a startling conclusion.

Buy/hold over the short/medium/long term simply doesn't work anymore. The markets are too volatile. 

If we existed in a free-market capitalistic system, buy and hold would be a solid long-term investing strategy without any question... but with increased frequency of the boom/bust cycle facilitated by the Federal Reserve (and any central bank for that matter); buy and hold simply is not what it once was... there is too much concurrent volatility outside of market control for buy/hold to be consistent over the long term.

Over the past few months I have spent hundreds of hours researching and crafting an optimal strategy for the medium-long term investor (10-40 years). I've formulated a completely different approach that has proven returns (based on my calculations) over the long term. My idea is simple to implement, and quite honestly extremely easy to follow. 

-----

**To start...** I implement this strategy with Vanguard... so for a decent majority of us investors here this is not a problem at all. Secondly, I ONLY use ETFs. ETFs can be traded intraday, and that's crucial for this strategy. And finally... 52-week high/low charts will be your life. 

*The way my strategy works is simple:*

1) Choose a single equity ETF fund that tracks a broad index fund (in my case I chose *VBK* for it's high risk/reward and volatility, which is what you kind of want with this strategy).

2) Apply 50% of the available funds that you're beginning with into this fund, and apply the other 50% of the available funds you plan on investing into *VCIT* (Vanguard Corporate Bond Fund). I chose *VCIT* for it's relative low volatility, my distrust in government bonds, and consistently better returns with what I feel is the lowest volatility out of any bond fund I've researched. 

For the example I'm about to use, I start with $10,000. I take $5,000 and place it into *VBK*, and I take the remaining $5,000 and place it into *VCIT*. 

Like myself, and like most investors for that matter... I plan on consistently contributing to my growing investments, so as a rule, all **NEW** contributions are split 50% into *VBK*, and 50% into *VCIT*. 

Here is where you need to pay attention to the 52-week high/low chart for *VBK*. Whenever a stock rises +25% from the 52-week low, sell 20% of the available stocks in your fund and place them in *VCIT*. Every 25% increase thereafter will be followed be a 40% sell off of remaining *VBK*... 60% once it reaches +75% from the low, etc... So at +50% from a 52-week low, you would sell 40%, and at +75% I would sell the remaining 60%, etc. Also, new contributions that are going 50% into *VBK* and 50% into *VCIT* will be shifted by 5% increments every time there's a +25% from *VBK's* low... so at +25%, 50 +5% (55%) of new contributions will go into *VCIT*, at +50% increase from 52-week high, 50% +10 (60%) of new contributions will go into *VCIT*... etc.

Inversely, whenever *VBK* falls -5% from it's high... increase your position by 10% increments with your available *VCIT* bonds. So the first -5% drop from the high will be followed by a 10% transfer from bonds into *VBK*. At -10% from the high contribute 20% of remaining bonds... -15% / 30%, etc... Also, new contributions that are going 50% into *VBK* and 50% into *VCIT* will be shifted by 5% increments every time there's a -5% from *VBK*'s high... so at -5%, 55% of new contributions are placed into *VBK*... at -10%, 60%, etc. 

With this strategy you're effectively buying low and selling high. From 2000-2009, this strategy has beaten the *S&amp;P* by over 10% annualized... and from 2009-2013, this strategy has more than doubled the performance of the *S&amp;P 500* annualized... and it's simple and easy to follow.",finance,1398908855
personalfinance,Question about wage negotiation,"I posted this in /r/jobs as well, but I figured this topic also pertains to this subreddit so I'm giving it a shot here too.

I applied for this job (from Craigslist, to give some context) and the listing didn't include the amount the job pays per hour. They called me, gave me an impromptu little phone interview, and part of that included asking me what my salary requirements were. I was desperate for work so I said something like ""I'm entirely sure, but I was hoping to make around $12 an hour(?)"" and the person on the other end of the line kind of half scoffed and said something like ""Yeah that'll be no problem"".

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I find out this job actually entails working at a call center. There are two types of callers; one is more laid back and another deals with sales. The guy that interviewed me said sales make a bit more, and asked me which I'd prefer. I said sales. It's important to note that due to the ""it's not for everybody"" nature of a call center, they insist on starting people part time.
It comes time for them to officially offer me this job, and they want me to sign an agreement that says I agree to work part time at X dollars an hour. The page is set up so that there's a line that goes ""Salary/wage: ____"". Well lo and behold, it turns out the document they want me to sign and turn in on my first day of work has $12/hour filled out.

What do you all think? Is this merely a coincidence, and everyone gets paid this amount, or did they take my salary requirements literally? I feel like I'm worth more than $12/hour, especially if I'm doing sales, and I am really tempted to print out two sheets to bring, one with $12 and one with $13 or $14. I've heard of people changing things in contracts such as lease agreements and house financing, but would this would in a similar way or am I being naive? I was thinking I could just put my hands up and be like ""Oops ya got me, hahaha"" and save myself some embarrassment by handing them the right sheet if they're like ""WTF?"". The extra money might not seem like a lot to you all but it would be a huge difference to me, so I'm kind of stressed out about this.

The other thing is, if I do end up staying on full time once they train me and what not, would that be a better time to negotiate?",finance,1398916857

personalfinance,Budgeting with separate finances (CA),"Hey all, love this forum! :) I was wondering if you all have any experience/advice on budgeting while keeping finances separate. Me and my fiance keep them separate currently and plan to do so after marriage. We don't do it t0 'hide' anything - e.g. we transfer money to each other when needed, we check in on each other's bank accounts if interested, I used my credit line to pay her student loan for better interest rate, etc.

One of the reasons we keep things separate is our incomes are fairly different and will be more so as time goes on. Obviously, we split shared costs proportionally based on income, but we allocate our own fun money based on our separate incomes (keeping them in the same ballpark). I know to some of you this will seem unfair or not to the true spirit of being in a relationship, but it works well for us.

So basically my question is, in terms of making a budget what would make more sense? Previously, we both basically spent reasonable and this resulted in a ~30-50% savings rate for me (I pay rent) and 50% savings rate for her. But there were some areas we definitely overspend in (food and restaurants come to mind) so I thought it would be best to actually budget some of these things. The only tricky thing is, because we keep our finances separate, what's the best way to budget? I don't mind budgeting 'after the fact' (ala Mint) or on the go (ala YNAB) but she hates the idea of inputting every transaction so currently we both use separate Mint accounts.

For the last month, we tried separate budgets e.g.

*  my budget includes rent, hydro, my cell phone, my internet, restaurants, my fun money, my savings
* her budget includes her cell phone, groceries, her fun money, her savings

Is this the best way to go?

Also if interested, our brief financial picture:

* my income: 55-60k / year (pre-tax but I won't pay tax for a couple of years due to tuition credits)
* her income: 20k / year (pre-tax)
* my savings: 30k (all invested in ETFs)
* credit line debt: 4k
* her savings: 1k (high interest savings acct)
* unmet liabilities (wedding): ~4-5k

(We're focused on paying down debt and wedding expenses with any savings).",finance,1398921176
dogecoin,Shibes of Reddit - Why do YOU keep coins on Exchanges or Online Wallets?,"I've always had a strong predisposition against keeping my dogecoins in online wallets or in exchanges. Today it suddenly occured to me why it bothers me so much. Its three fold really - Security, Insurance, and Interest. Why do people keep there fiat in banks instead of in a shoe box or stuffed in a sock? well thats easy you say - 

1) banks are vastly more secure than the average persons home. This makes storing large sums of money more attractive

2) because of item #1 - banks are INSURED! In the united states the average checking or savings account is FDIC insured up to $250k. This is included automatically when you open an account at most larger banks.

3) Banks also offer Interest! as account holders we can see our small or vast sums grow over time via interest. Interest that's paid to us by the bank for the privilege of being able to hold and use our money in a guaranteed fashion

So between points 1-3, why should we as cryptocurrency users ever store any amount of coin on a long term basis on exchanges or in online wallets? It seems like nothing but risk with very little (currently) offered in return in terms of traditional banking incentives or assurances. What am I missing here?

Bitcoin,Quadriplegia and Bitcoin have nothing in common....,"But at least it does for one person on this planet.  Just a little story I want to share with our community. January 2013 I came across an article about Bitcoin. I don't remember what article but that was the start of my spiral down the rabbit hole. A little bit about me I'm not the most knowledgeable, computer savvy person. I consider myself smart enough to get by. I learn by reading and a lot of trial and error. Slightly above average IQ and a closet nerd. I'm college educated with an entrepreneurial heart at birth. Since I had never heard about Bitcoin before my curiosity took me to a couple more pages and eventually to the white paper. From what I understood I knew this could be big and I wanted to be part of the future.  I'll admit I read the whole paper but it was brutal since I felt I needed a PhD to truly grasp the whole meaning. With more exposure from other sources I was able to piece together a solid understanding of S.N creation. I was hooked and felt I needed to be involved. I then downloaded the client but I felt alone until I found Reddit and sub/r's.

I stumbled across it all at the right time because I was fed up with social networking sites and was looking for a new community. I have easily spent several hundred hours reading articles and watching videos and immersing myself in Bitcoin and now other crypto-currencies. I know enough by scratching the surface a little every day. I guess what I'm saying is that Bitcoin and crypto-currencies has brought a new interest in my life. 

The world that I wake up in everyday now is different than the world I saw 11 years ago. I was a passenger in a single car wreck that left me paralyzed from the neck down. From a fully capable able-bodied person to a dependent wheelchair user became my reality in a split second. Because of my physical limitations there are not many things that bring enjoyment to my life. But that one evening when Bitcoin entered my vocabulary,  I started my journey and felt different in the sense that I'm excited every morning to look at the price whether it's up or down. I have saved and bookmarked several pages that contain valuable information that I've retained from this community.

 I've dabbled of course nothing that I can't afford to lose into Bitcoin and a couple other alt coins. I've taking very good advice from those with more experience to the point that I now have cold storage wallets. I learned how to use a live bootable USB to do my bidding LOL. I am a long-term holder by nature there's nothing in our current physical world that I want more than to be able to gain my independence back. So I hope one day I will take my cold storage paper wallet and exchange One Bitcoin for a iron Man exoskeleton or spend a night in one of Elysium's magic healing beds. 

I've also enjoyed learning about other platforms that may incorporate Bitcoin or are completely separate systems on their own. (Ripple, Namecoin, Etherium, etc.) I am unemployed but would love to  one day work at home supporting myself with crypto-currencies. So if anybody is out there with ideas I would love to hear some opportunities that people are working on. Smart contracts is an area that I have just been exposed to and find myself trying to think ways of a career path for me. I've thought about day-trading but I know better I am not the one person that actually makes money from it. I know it's too early to tell but Bitcoin/ Blockchain technology is amazing.  Anyway, I hope the boat is wheelchair accessible, To the Moon!",cryptocurrency,1398959243

My current mortgage is a 30 year fixed FHA with a 3.875% interest rate, $120/month PMI and a total PITI of $925/month.  I purchased the house with 3.5% down for $142,000 2 years ago and housing prices have skyrocketed in my area since, Zillow (I know not entirely accurate) values the house at $203,000.

Since I now believe I have more than 20% equity I want to refinance to get rid of the PMI.  I also am thinking of refinancing to a 15 year mortgage to lower my interest rate as well, I should be able to get an interest rate of around 3% from my credit union.

I currently owe approximately $133,000 on the house and my payment would go from $925 currently to around $1100 on the 15 year mortgage while getting rid of the PMI and paying off the house 15 years earlier.  I make $56,000/year in a very stable job.

personalfinance,Wife and I are drowning and we apparently can't swim. SoS,"The bottom line is, my wife and I are horrible at managing our personal finances. I'll give a little back story to paint a clear picture of the situation.

We've been together for 12 years, we have 2 kids. We've both always been bad with bills, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. When we receive money, we wait to pay the bills until either A) The service is either suspended or will be soon, or B) we are getting paid again the next day. This means we are typically at least a month behind on all the bills we pay, including our mortgage, car payment and utilities. The reason I think we do this is because we are scared to death of being broke. There's something about not having any money that petrifies us. 

We're smart enough to know that if we would get caught up, stop spending so much on things we don't need and save money instead, we could live comfortably and ahead. It seems every time we try it back-fires horribly. 

We own a house in Wichita, but we live in Hutchinson due to my job. We rent here in Hutch. We have a tenant that pays enough rent to cover the mortgage.

We gross about $100k/year, but my paychecks are a bit irregular. I get a bonus based on sales at my job, it's pretty stable on a yearly basis but can vary month to month. For example, I'll typically gross $4800 in January, while September can be almost $9000. The bonus is all but guaranteed, and makes up about 65% of my income (the rest is a monthly salary). I'm the only one that works, but my wife gets around $550 per month from the federal government, and we receive $625 rent on the house we own. That's the extent of our income. 

Our estimated monthly obligations are as follows:

Rent: $1000
Mortgage: $550
Car loan: $540
Car insurance: $240
Gas/Electric: $350
Cable/Internet: $130
Phone (3 lines): $275
Water/Trash: $65
Gas: $230
Groceries: $600

Total $3980

As you can see, while our monthly expenses may seem high to some, They are not unreasonable compared to the amount of money we make. If you assume after taxes I bring home $5000 (average) and include my wife's SS income and the rent check, we should have at least $2000 left over after paying all the regular monthly bills.

Where does it go? For starters, while I don't have any conventional loans or credit cards, I do currently have 2 pay-day loans, one for $500 that costs me about $150/month if I don't pay it off. The is roughly double that, $1000 that costs $250/month. That takes the $2000 down to $1600. Then you have to include cigarettes (my wife smokes, I vape) which is around $200/month, and my monster energy addiction (let's call it breakfast), which can come up to $200/month. Monthly doctor visits and medication costs equal about $160, and I spend around $40 on internet services that aren't necessary (hobby). That still leaves a (un)healthy $1000 in the bank to work with. Remember that this is an average month. Some month's I'd have nothing left over with this budget, other months I'd have $3000 or more. 

I have a number of accounts in collections. Medical bills between my family and I total around $10k. There are a number of smaller debts, a few hundred each, that probably equal $800. I owe my grandfather $5600, I borrowed some money thinking I could dig myself out of debt. That did not work. I filed for bankruptcy 4.5 years ago. All of this debt is after that. 

Lastly, I owe the IRS and State DOR thousands. I made a stupid mistake and claimed exempt on my w4s for years, while neglecting to file. Since we moved to Hutchinson taxes have been coming out of my check, but again, due to my irrational fears, cowardice, and stupidity, I have not filed this year or last. I am intentionally avoiding filing because I know I will owe more, and it already feels like I'm drowning. 

My tax debt is killing me. Just thinking about it causes minor panic attacks, chest pains, etc.. I'm not even thirty and it feels like I've failed forever financially, and instead of doing the rational thing and calling the IRS, I hide from the problem and pretend it doesn't exist. I know I can't do that too much longer, The state has already put a lien on my house and turned some of the unpaid debt over to collections. It won't be long before the IRS does the same. 

Because of the amount of money I make I'm not able to file a offer in compromise. I was on a pay agreement with both of them, but ultimately broke it and failed to pick it back up. 

I have no retirement plan at all (my employer offers nothing), no savings, nothing of real value besides the house, which is worth maybe $60k and I still have 22 years on the mortgage. 

All I want is to provide a safe, stable future for my children and my wife. I want to avoid the embarrassment and struggle of the sure to come wage garnishments, bank levies and court cases. I want to live a normal life, where I'm responsibly meeting my financial obligations and I'm able to look at my children and not feel guilty. 

Can you help? I'm tried to tackle this problem so many times over the last 12 years, I always land right back where I started. I recently posted a job offer on craigslist, asking for someone to manage my finances in a way that would get me out of debt and on track. I also asked for guidance, advice, counselling, anything they thought would help. I've talked to bankers and investment consultants about handling my monthly obligations for me, they said it doesn't work that way. I've cut up my debit card, closed bank accounts, set up auto-pays... Nothing has ever worked. I don't know what to do.",finance,1398968415
financialindependence,Managing income to maximize Obamacare subsidies in FI,"I've been thinking a lot about health insurance in financial independence lately. Obamacare has made this topic more complicated by changing the insurance marketplace so that insurance is more comprehensive (and thus more expensive). As a result, the low-cost, high-deductible plans favored by the FI set are essentially illegal (barring a hardship exemption). 

At the same time, government subsidies can help FIers buy ""commercial grade"" insurance for free or nearly so. The amount of the subsidy is based on your income as a percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), with the highest subsidy available at income equal to 138% of the FPL (below that level, you would instead qualify for Medicaid in most states, which is a separate discussion). So the trick is to manage your income in FI to equal 138% of the FPL so as to achieve the maximum possible subsidy (see /u/rootofgoodblog's comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1nnq6z/effects_of_acaobamacare_on_early_retirement/ccn873s)). 

As described in that comment, perhaps the easiest way for FIers to manage their income to the 138% FPL target is to use Traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions to ""true up"" their income to the appropriate level. In other words, take all of your income over the course of the year - dividends, capital gains, interest, odd jobs, etc. - subtract that from the 138% FPL target and convert the remaining amount from traditional IRA to Roth. That way you're eligible for the maximum subsidy under Obamacare, meaning your health insurance is essentially free. 

With that in mind, then, it seems advantageous to have as much money as possible in your traditional IRA (or 401ks) going into FI, so that you have enough to convert each year throughout FI. Obviously this is yet another reason to max out your 401k. 

But what if I wanted to get even more into my traditional IRA pre-FI? I could simply contribute $5,500 each year to my traditional IRA. But here's the rub: my wife and I make too much money to qualify for the tax deduction benefit of a traditional IRA (all of our investing today is thus either in 401ks/HSAs or in taxable accounts). So we can still contribute to an IRA (and the investments will be tax sheltered while they're in the account) but there are risks to doing so, mainly double taxation (e.g., put taxed income in, then have it taxed again upon distribution) and the potential closure of the traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversion loophole. 

Neither of these troubles me too much. Double taxation is avoidable (or at least can be minimized) with good tax management, especially given that two personal exemptions plus the standard deduction essentially equal 138% of the FPL. In addition, the combined benefits of (1) shielding dividends and gains from taxes and (2) the subsidies obtained more than offset the potential tax. The closure of the conversion loophole is a risk, but one I'm already exposed to via my 401k. 

(TL;DR) So, the point of this rambling is to ask: does it make sense to contribute to my non-deductible IRA so as to maximize my ability to ""manage"" income in FI and maximize potential health insurance subsidies despite the risk of double taxation? I think it does, but want to make sure I'm not missing something obvious.

personalfinance,Claiming federal tax exemption on W-4,"At my company, we make a base salary plus monthly incentive. Bonus is paid on the last Friday of the month irrespective of other paychecks, meaning sometimes they are their own check. This sucks in terms of taxes and deductions and can easily eat over 50% of the bonus. 

A habit many of us have gotten into is moving our W-4 status to exempt for a few of these pay periods. This started with one or two people and spread to at least a dozen I can think of off the top of my head.

Some play riskier than others and go months at a time. I have only done it for 2 paychecks so far this year. But for several reasons I could use the extra money this month and was planning to have all three May paychecks be exempt.

Questions:

* Is this illegal? :O I wouldn't think so, since my tax burden will be the same whether it comes out of my paycheck every month or I pay it at the end of the year, but I do feel guilty because on the W-4 website I have to check a box that says something like ""I certify that I am eligible for exemption from federal tax for this tax year.""
* I get a large refund every year, but I'm still nervous about going too far and putting myself in a situation where I would owe. Is there an easy way to calculate this and try to balance it out?",finance,1398973735

A Master Limited Partnership that has an unsustainable business practice, unless management changes their financial policies soon.

Master Limited Partnership’s (MLP’s) in the energy sector have become increasingly popular with retail investors. Their main attraction is their perceived riskless investment that pays a yearly distribution of 6%. Now a truly riskless investment yielding 6% per annum is quite lucrative considering we are currently in a near zero interest rate environment. However, caveat emptor, many retail investors have no idea what they are getting themselves into!

Lastly, when the sales-rep starts chit-chatting about how you will spend your easily earned earnings on a family vacation in the Bahama’s, hang up the phone!

Just to clarify, it is not that Fat Pitch thinks all MLP’s are bad, it is just that most are! We see no point in explaining the background of the Eagle Rock Energy Partners – NASDAQ:EROC business since it is a horrible investment! Let us move on to the important part: the financials, focusing on a 3 year history of cash-flows statement seen at this hyperlink:

http://www.fatpitchinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/11.png

Right off the bat a keen investor will realize that the 2013 cash flows from operating activities (line B) is only $6,000,000 more than depreciation (line A). In other words, the company is barely earning enough from their operations to replace what is consumed just to maintain the status quo of business operations. Also consider that Eagle Rock obtains positive cash flows from a depleting asset (oil &amp; gas reserves) and their gas compressing and processing plants will need replacing every so often. Replacement costs have been reviewed and we agree that this yearly depreciation figure very accurate.

Next, lets look at lines C and D: sections from the cash flow from financing activities. Notice how unsustainable this investment is!? Line C shows 2013 dividend distributions equal to 70% of its yearly cash flows from operations. You read that right! 70% went straight to investors via the dividend! And to think that this company cannot even earn enough to pay for its own replacement cost. Our calculations reflect Eagle Rock having a yearly shortfall of $118 million.

So how to they stay in business!? Lets take a look at Line D. Thank goodness they have hard-nosed investment bankers to push new stock on the market to unsuspecting retail investors! And every time Eagle Rock Energy Partners – NASDAQ:EROC raises capital by selling equity, these investment bankers collect a pound of flesh, typically 5-7% of the total amount of capital raised, in 2013 that total amount of new equity sold to the market was $96 million. Investment bankers probably walked away with $6 million at the end of the transaction.

Seems pretty reasonable to say that the only persons making any return on investment are the investment bankers! Please let F.P.I. kindly remind you that Eagle Rock Energy Partners – NASDAQ:EROC is not the only company playing the “raise capital just to pay dividends because our business can’t economically support itself” game!",finance,1398980819

personalfinance,Federal Student Loans &amp; Maximizing PAYE Debt Forgiveness,"My husband and I both have/will have graduate degrees paid for almost entirely by loans. (He's an attorney, I'm an incoming 1L nontraditional student). Upon graduation, I expect we'll have about $180,000 in combined student loans at rates between 4-8%. It's a lot, I know.

We've built up an emergency fund and have been saving for retirement. We bought a house (I know, I know - Dave Ramsay devotees are clutching their pearls, but it was the right choice for us. Our current housing expense is comparable to what we paid in rent, and we can tap into savings/Roth IRAs in the event of catastrophe.) Beside the mortgage and student loans, we carry no other debt.

I am planning to enter a niche field (tax law) that has relatively strong job prospects and is a good match for my work experience. My husband has less of a niche specialty and currently earns $60,000 working at a startup. (Yes, it's risky putting him in sole breadwinner role given the risks inherent to startup life. It's not ideal, but if disaster struck there are always more student loans available. We're trying to minimize this to whatever extent possible.) Public Service Loan Forgiveness isn't something that will work for either one of us. 

Because all of these are eligible for PAYE - reducing our payment to 10% of discretionary income - I'm confident that student loans won't prevent us from eating. This program allowed us to stay on top of loan payments in the 2 years my husband struggled to find work, and will probably be necessary while I pursue my own JD.

However - I'm currently struggling to figure out our loan repayment strategy. Assuming we'll make a combined $125,000 when I graduate, the monthly minimum under PAYE will be much less than the $1800-ish monthly payment under the 10 year standard plan. Should we throw every extra dollar we have at the debt, or should we maximize the amount to be forgiven in 20 years by paying only the minimum under PAYE and put aside extra for the tax bill? 

**TL/DR: Should we pay more than PAYE to get rid of student loans ASAP, or pay the minimum and have it forgiven?**",finance,1398985614

Someone should start a website that tracks these guys 'n' gals.  


Dear Mr. XXXX:

 

Thank you for contacting me regarding the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) network neutrality regulations.  I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.

 
The Internet is a vital communications tool for millions of Americans.  The speed and ease at which information can be retrieved over the Internet is unparalleled.  The applications and devices that can be used on the Internet enable families and friends to stay connected, businesses to accomplish their goals, and students to conduct research.    

  

  Even in the midst of an economic downturn, private entrepreneurs and companies have invested billions of dollars in developing state of the art broadband infrastructure.  On December 21, 2010, the FCC voted 3-2 to move forward on plans to pursue a so-called ""Open Internet Order,"" which would essentially give the FCC ultimate authority to regulate broadband Internet.    

 

The FCC had previously classified broadband providers as ""information services"" rather than ""common carriers."" Historically the agency has had a more limited set of regulatory controls over ""information services"" than it does over ""common carriers."" 

 

***The December 2010 decision did not reclassify broadband providers, but it did represent a major shift in FCC policy, a shift that had been rejected by both Democratic and Republican administrations alike. The broadband marketplace is not broken and increased government oversight of the Internet will dramatically slow the pace of future investment into broadband networks, limiting economic growth.***

 

***Fortunately, on January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that this kind of federal interference was a bridge too far.  The court struck down the so-called ""net neutrality"" rules because the FCC was disregarding its own rules by attempting to blur the lines between ""information services and ""common carriers.""***

 

***While the agency has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, they have not pursued that option as of this writing. Moreover, the market is already responding to the new broadband landscape.  On February 23, 2014, the video-streaming service, Netflix, and Comcast agreed to a deal that will allow Netflix's customers more reliable access to Comcast's servers.***

 

I understand your concerns regarding access to broadband internet, and I will continue to monitor the situation should the FCC exercise their right to appeal.  Additionally, should new legislation regarding ""net neutrality"" come before the Senate, I will keep your thoughts and views in mind.

 

If you would like to receive timely email alerts regarding the latest congressional actions and my weekly e-newsletter, please sign up via my web site at: www.chambliss.senate.gov.  Please let me know whenever I may be of assistance.

personalfinance,Fell into a classic trap. I feel like an idiot. Don't be me.,"I had a student loan with Citibank that was partially bought out by Discover which then merged their loan services with Citibank. So essentially it turned into a huge clusterfuck where I now have two accounts through the same servicing website. Obnoxious but not a big deal. They also don't offer easy-to-sign-up automatic payments. Also not a huge deal. I'm diligent. So I happily logged in every month for the last several months. I wasn't focusing on these loans as they were not a high interest rate so I payed the minimum. 

**~~ALWAYS~~ MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THAT YOUR MINIMUM PAYMENTS ARE MORE THAN YOUR INTEREST ACCUMULATION***

This one slipped through the cracks because of the split/merge and my balance has been slowly going up instead of being payed down. I just went over my budget today and discovered this discrepancy and I feel like a complete imbecile.

~~I have since fixed this and am paying 5X the minimum payments to try to get rid of these loans as soon as possible.~~

^* EDIT: After discussing ramifications in this thread one thing has been made clear. As long as I was diligent in paying off as much as possible on my higher interest rate loans, accumulating balance on a lower interest rate loan to accomplish this still checks out mathematically.

news,WHY HAVE LEVEE DISTRICTS AT ALL?,"Friday, May 2st, 2014
Baton Rouge, Louisiana


WHY HAVE LEVEE DISTRICTS AT ALL?

Legislation is working its way through the Louisiana legislature that would strip levee districts of their autonomy.  Board members of several large levee boards are crying foul, and charge that flood protection will suffer and emergency responses will slow down.  Louisiana has twenty-three levee boards that cover the state’s waterways from the Arkansas border to the Gulf of Mexico.  But here’s the question.  Why have any levee boards at all?

For well over the first 200 years of Louisiana’s existence, all flood control efforts were constructed and initially paid for by the riverfront landowner, then by parishes adjoining the river, and then by funds raised by local levee boards. Federal involvement came about in 1917 with the passage of the Ransdell-Humphreys Flood Control Act, a flood control program designed to give protection up and down the Mississippi Valley. There was no requirement in this, and federal legislation that followed, that states seeking flood protection form levee boards.

Few other states have levee boards or levee districts. Mississippi has two. A number of states bordering the Mississippi River have none.

Louisiana spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on various other construction projects without the oversight of any appointed board. In this fiscal year, there is some $124 million in public building construction projects taking place in Louisiana. The state budget for highway construction this year will top $794 million. No Governor appointed board is in place to oversee any of this construction.

The simple fact is that having non-professionals appointed to boards that are given direct authority and control over basic protection to our public safety makes no sense in the 21st century. Professionals within the Louisiana State Department of Public Works and the U.S. Corps of Engineers would seem much better qualified to design the necessary flood protection plan, and oversee both the construction and maintenance of such important projects.

If the Corps of Engineers, as was alleged following Hurricane Katrina, made some serious errors in design and construction of our levy protection system, then certainly they should be held accountable. But do we continue to allow untrained, average citizens with no professional background to make decisions that, as we have tragically seen, can lead to serious of consequences including the loss of human life?

Merely scaling down the present 23 levee boards to a handful doesn’t really address the problem. Levee boards are outdated. They are a thing of the past.

The Dutch do not turn over the protection of their entire nation, a country that rests primarily below sea level, to a board of non-professionals. Neither do the Italians in their efforts to defend their city on the sea, Venice. We live in the richest, most powerful and technologically advanced nation on earth. Surely the Governor, the Legislature, and the federal government can get together and work out a better administrative system than what we now have in place. There’s too much at stake.

Is electing levee boards the answer, as has been suggested by U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu? That makes about as much sense as electing firemen and policemen.

The 23 levy boards that are scattered throughout Louisiana are, for the most part, made up of decent, hardworking people who hold a variety of jobs, and they all have one thing in common: they know nothing about building and maintaining levees.

In the levee district debate presently before the legislature, there is an opportunity to end the parochialism that pits one parish or district against another. Statewide oversight would allow decisions to be made that are for the good of the state as a whole instead of drawing lines that shouldn’t exist. 

Simply put, these times call for changes in the age-old system of political fiefdoms in the Bayou State. Take the politics out of levee engineering. That’s the way it works all over the world.  Why should Louisiana be any different?

personalfinance,"[Update on my previous post as well ] Advice needed, super-in-depth look at my finances inside!","Alright. So, on Tuesday, I was granted the lump sum of 7,224$. It has not been taxed, meaning I will be paying the IRS. My mother said a good amount would be about ~10%, so 720$, so I don't have to pay into my tax returns. I like getting money back at the end of my taxes. So awesome. 

So, in a separate savings account, I have 1,257$ saved up. They're both with the same bank, and I will be calling to have them combined so I can get the .698% dividends on them. This would combine both accounts into 8,476.55$. 

So, subtract 720$ (plus 200$ I need to give to my mom) and you get the number: 7,556.55$. 

I do have a credit card, and recently, the ceiling was raised from 1,000$ to 1,500$. I always pay it off at the end of the month and never spend more than I have. I have the Capital One Journey card, but plan on applying for the Quicksilver (because, fuck yeah, cashback!). I've had it for a little under a year (it will be turning 1 year old in October). When I apply for the Quicksilver, should I keep the Journey open or should I close it? ((Sidenote: when I checked my creditscore via credit karma, it said I had a score of 708, but I took it with a grain of salt)). 

Alright, onto the nitty gritty. I have student loans, too. Principle is 24,002$. Interest has accumulated to 798.50$. I will be entering my grace period beginning 05/09/2014, and over the summer, I plan on paying down the interest so I can start getting at the principle. Upon talking to 2 customer service reps on the phone, I received this information: 

• I accrue 1.94$ in interest a day 

• Somehow this adds up to 58.20$ in interest a month. 

I get paid weekly. It's easier for me to budget out weekly. I will have some money to play around with this summer, as my mother and father pay for my cellphone, car insurance, and medical. However, at the end of this year, they might not claim me on their taxes. I've read (and been told) a person can claim 2,500$ of their interest as tax deductible. What exactly does that mean? 

Also, upon talking to the 2 customer service reps, I found out I could apply - and get - a plan that would slide up and down with my income. As the 7K lump sum will count as income this year, I will artificially inflate from 12-13K to about 19-20K. She said, however, that even if that were the case, my monthly payments would slide to ~50$. 

Additionally, I found out that with my loan provider, if I apply for AutoPay (Schedule payments to get taken out of a bank account every xx day of the month), I get a .25% interest reduction across the board on all 4 of my loans. These are my loans and their rates as of right now: 

•Subsidized  	$5,500.00	3.4%

•Subsidizedn	$5,500.00	3.86%

•Unsubsidized	$6,002.00	3.86%

•Unsubsidized	$7,000.00	6.8%

The catch? I can't apply for the sliding-income repayment plan OR the AutoPay until 45 days before my grace period ends. The good news is that payments aren't required, but I'll be making them over the summer anyway to get at that interest. 

I have until 05/08 this month that I can pay directly to the principle. But that puts me in a pickle because my car is creeping up to 100K miles, and what if I need a new one? What if things happen? I'm hesitant to put down large amounts of money on the loan because - shit happens in my family. Tires break, we get hit - weird shit happens to us a lot when we think we're safe. 

Over the summer, I anticipate averaging about 30 hours a week. To do the math really quick: 

30 • 9.42 = ~282.60$ 

Of that, I have to pay federal taxes, I get 11$ taken out a week and put into a savings account, and an extra 12$ taken out and paid to the IRS to make sure I get a huge tax return. Because I did that last year, I got 1,700$ on my tax return. It was a damn nice feeling. ((Additionally, I'm budgeting out about ~~75$ a week in fuel costs, work is 31 miles one way, and my car only gets about 22 mpg)). 

Now, on the subject of student loans (still lol), I plan on going overseas, and teaching, and coming back stateside. When I do, I am going to be applying for two loan forgiveness programs: 

• 10 year loan forgiveness: established by Obama's (I think?) administration, it states that you must pay your loans for 10 years, and work for 10 years in the public service sector (teacher falls into this category) and whatever remains of your loan will be forgiven. ((If this information is wrong, please tell me!)) 

• Teacher Loan Forgiveness: I must swear to work 5 years in a school district labeled ""in-need"" (poverty, etc, etc). In doing so, if I teach math or science, I would be entitled to 17,500$ in loan forgiveness after the five-year period. As I'm not (plan on teaching English and languages), I will be given 5,000$, or possibly more. They want math and science teachers, unfortunately, I am neither. 

So. Thoughts? Opinions? Advice? 

Oh, one more thing. I will be taking a course over the summer to get another letter behind my name (the more alphabet soup, the better). This course will cost me 2,775$. I had the one savings account before I figured out I would be getting money, set up another one to figure out what to do with it. This program allows a payment plan, and I'm going to be putting it all on my credit card (because I have the money for it) for that delicious, delicious cash back. 

Any and all cash back I receive goes into my savings account. 

Whew. Alright, I think that about covers it. I kind of have a weird situation, I know. I'm just looking forward to (hopefully!) not being claimed as a dependent, because that will afford me some concessions on taxes, and I'd be liable to get free healthcare via the state. Alright, I'll stop talking now. Any and all help welcomed, appreciated, and loved!",finance,1398996230
personalfinance,The Libor Rate Forecast and Student Loans - Thoughts?,"First an foremost I am not sure that this belongs here and if you think it should be somewhere else, please make a recommendation and I will move it else where.

The reason I even bring up the Libor rate is because it is directly tied to my variable interest private loans. I have about $21,000ish tied up in 3 private student loans. Whenever I have a question, instantly I call and ask any and every question I can think of, I am paying them might as well get my money's worth right? Anyways, about a year ago I figured out that my variable interest rate loans were based off the Libor rate. As it stands right now, two of the loans are 2.95+Libor and 2.99+ Libor. Luckily for me the Libor has been in the shitter recently since the controversy surrounding it. 

Now I went back and looked at the historical data associated with the Libor rate to try and figure out the past history on it and how it could potentially impact my interest rate. In September of 1989, the 3-Month libor rate was 9.125 (with my 2.95 added on would put my interest rate at 12.075%. Since then it has gone down to a low in the 3's then the most recent high of 5.49 in September of 2007. The most recent April numbers show the Libor is now at 0.2273 (all numbers from http://www.fedprimerate.com/libor/libor_rates_history.htm). 

So it is putting me in a bit of a pickle. I have around the same amount of debt in federal student loans at 6% fixed interest rate. Is it better to risk having my private loans stay low and pay off my public loans first or should I take advantage of this opportunity and pay them off sooner than the public ones.

Does anyone have any input on the Libor and how or why it would go up or down? At my current repayment rate, I should be debt free within 5 years. Obviously to minimize interest payments I should pay off highest interest rate first, but should I take advantage of the low (and I mean REALLY low) rates interest rates on my private loans and pay on my public loans. The only thing is how risky is that basing the fact my variable rates are based off the libor????

Many sleepless nights have been lost over this so any input, help, or recommendations would be appreciated!

personalfinance,I think I've reduced expenses everywhere that I can. Please help me find more money I can save.,"We are living on just my income for the foreseeable future.  My husband is staying home with the baby.  His earning potential is minimal, so I'm certain that we are better off with him at home.  On months when overtime is available, we are comfortable and even have a little extra to set aside.  On months when overtime is not available, things are very tight.  I've been doing everything I can to reduce expenses.  Please look at my budget and see if there's anything else I can save on.  I'm using YNAB's method to budget.  My take home pay is $3200/month.  This is after gym fees, health/dental insurance, and short term disability insurance. 

* Mortgage.............363 includes taxes &amp; insurance
* Internet...............65
* Electric................280-350 (Varies)
* Water..................45
* Netflix/Hulu..........16
* Spotify................10
* Cell Phones..........44 (just switched to Ting)
* Car Insurance.......99
* Sewer/Trash.........45
* Truck Payment......322
* Student Loans.......781
* Groceries.............400
* Fuel....................150 (varies)
* Spending Money....200 (100 for each of us)
* Restaurants..........30 (one meal out each month)
* Medical Bills..........100
* Medications...........58
* Pet Care...............25
* Kid......................25 (misc expenses for our 1 year old)
* Yearly..................34 (Expenses that hit yearly, car tags, etc)
* Christmas.............50

This adds up to slightly less than my month income, but something always comes up to ruin it and doesn't give me anything to set aside.  When our electric bill increases with summer, it will put me in the negative once again.
By working overtime, I've managed to get $1000 set aside for needed repairs on one of our vehicles and $2500 for a buffer.  My goal is to get $3200 in the buffer and then start building an emergency fund.  When I work overtime, I can manage setting money aside easily, but it comes and goes and some weeks I'm lucky to get my full time hours.  I would really love to get to a place where I don't have to rely on the overtime and I can make ends meet and be comfortable with what I make.    

The only other things I can think to do are the following:

1. Cancel our Internet and resubscribe under my name to get a new subscriber discount. This would be a huge hassle, but it would save us approximately $30/month.

2. Sell our truck.  First I must repair our car and I need another $400 or so before I can do that, plus help from a family member.  This would be a huge savings, but I'm having a difficult time figuring out if it's the right move.  For one, we just went through bankruptcy, and I reaffirmed this debt.  Paying this is helping to repair my credit.  If I were to need another vehicle, it would be difficult to get a loan and it would be a high interest loan.  It's a good vehicle, a Nissan, and if I keep it I will drive it for at least another decade.  I have 2 years left to pay it off.  We could get by with one vehicle.  I live close enough to work that car pooling or public transportation would be easy.  This would save us $390/month, plus fuel savings as our car is more efficient.  I owe less than what it is worth at this point.  I'm back and forth on this.  What is the best option?  That extra money would make us much more comfortable in the short term, but in the long term I feel like it's better to keep the vehicle.  It also allowed me to get to work when we had massive amounts of snow this winter.  I like the security of that.

3.  My student loans are as good as they are going to get.  They are private, they are in default and I must continue to pay this to keep Wells Fargo at bay.  My husband's are private and federal, so I suspect that there is something more that could be done here.  I am urging him to call them and try to arrange something else.  These loans are killing us.  

4.  I just thought of discussing with my husband the possibility of selling our elliptical and bowflex since they no longer meet his workout needs and we are paying for a gym membership.  I have also been urging him to sell his fun car, his Gremlin.  He is agreeable, but slow to make moves on this.  This is short term help.  They don't eliminate any monthly expenses.  Note: The gym membership includes child care, adding to it's value.

These are things we are doing or have already done:

1.  Cloth diaper and breast feed our child.  He's one so he's drinking cow's milk now. His wardrobe is hand me downs from friends.  His toys are hand me downs or from yard sales.
2.  Switched the cell phone plan from Sprint to Ting and saved $100/month.
3.  Eat most of our meals at home. 
4.  Minimal money spent on entertainment. 
5.  Sell things around the house on Craigslist and Facebook when possible.  We make various amounts of cash for this.  It helps.  
6.  I coupon at Target when the deal is right and it's something we would buy anyway.  
7.  Groceries are almost exclusively from Aldi.
8.  No cable.  Ever.  We've always been cord cutters.
9.  Went in on a whole cow with friends, we got a quarter.  The savings and quality of this was really astounding. 


I constantly read frugal blogs and tips and tricks to save money like I'm going to find one more carrot of wisdom that I'm missing.  I want to be comfortable.  I want to not rely on overtime.  My relationship with money has totally changed in the last year or so and I want to make things work.  My husband and I only recently combined our bank accounts.  For the first time in my life, I have full control over the finances.  I must make this work. Thanks in advance for any advice. 

TL;DR: I'm going to have to sell the truck, aren't I?  It's the only way.  Now that I think about it, two more years of struggling and worrying about making the payments really aren't worth it, are they?  Gah.  

Edit:  Thank you to everyone for your thoughtful responses.  I have a list of things to look into that I discussed with my husband tonight.  Here's where I'm going to start. 

1.  Continue to look at selling the truck, dependant on what sort of income my husband can bring in.  If he ends up getting a part time job with flexible hours, we will need the second vehicle.  If he can make a little money, making the payments for two more years seems worth it.  Plus, I can put off the repairs on the car for possibly another summer as long as we still have the truck. 
2.  Do what I can to decrease the electric bill.  My power company will do an energy audit for $50.  A little more research told me that we may qualify for assistance with energy updates that include insulation! I'll mail off this application on Monday.  I'll clean the dryer vent and consider the Kill A Watt if the energy audit doesn't give us the answers we need there.  We are turning off more lights and discussing other ways we can lower the bill.
3.  Call our ISP and push for the lower bill.  If they decline, I will call their bluff and cancel so we can resubscribe. 
4.  My husband will call about his loans and research new possibilities there. 
5.  My husband will look into including babysitting, Mturk, survey sites, secret shopping and voices.com.  
6.  Sell that darn Gremlin and the Bowflex too.  He's not willing to give up the elliptical.  

Thanks again for reading and providing such excellent suggestions.  We'll make some changes and hopefully see a difference.  If we can reduce our expenses a little more and also make just a little more, we will feel the difference.",finance,1399018320

personalfinance,17F needing advice to maximize my ability to pay off University,"Hi everyone, I am 17 years old and I will be graduating high school in June. I live in Canada, and I will be attending university in the Fall.

* I have ~$6000 in my banking account right now.

* My parents have helped me save $20,000 for university, and I have contributed $5000, for a total of ~$25,000 in my university savings account.

* I currently have two jobs, one paying $11.00/hr and another paying $10.30/hr. I will be saving 99% of my income, since I don't have any expenses and I do not spend any of it except for the occasional lunch or snack out. I'm still in school, so I only work on weekends, but during the summer I am hoping to work 40-50+ hours a week.

* But since I am going away for school, I won't be able to work the two jobs. One of my jobs will transfer me to a store in the location of the school I'm going to, so I will be working part-time during school (hopefully).

* I will be attending university for Medical Sciences. Tuition = $7000, Residence + Food = $12000, so each year would be around $20k. OSAP, a provincial student assistance plan, will give me 30% off tuition, with interest-free loans until 6 months after I graduate, as well as bursaries, which I believe I will qualify for. I'm also going to be getting a $2000 admission scholarship for my first year (94% average).

* I'm in a middle class family, and my parents make about $80k combined after taxes. I still have a younger brother who will be entering university 2 years later, so they need to think about him as well. My family lives pretty modestly, with no debts at all (mortgage and cars paid off) and my parents try to save as much money as possible.

Should I use all my money right now and pay off what I can? Or pay it off later? The loans I will be getting are interest free until 6 months after graduation, when it will become around 8-9% interest rate. But I will be going to professional school after my undergraduate 4 years, to become either an optometrist/pharmacist or doctor. So what would be the best way to pay off my student loans?",finance,1399043936

Currently how we have our checks allocation is we each put $450 into a joint account to pay bills, $400 into our personal check accounts, and the remaining into our individual savings accounts, anything that we have left over when we get paid again from our checking accounts gets moved into savings, we use the checking accounts to pay for things like groceries, going out to eat, any spending money we allocate. we each contribute 3% to our company 401k, as that is the amount they match. Neither of us have an IRA, though it is something we would like to begin putting money into. We are expecting our first child this September, we've already got some of the big ticket items purchased/handed down, and are already able to cover 2-3 days /week for childcare through grandparents &amp; other family. 

Our 5 year plan is to pay down all of our debts and move into a nicer area with better schools, since our current area has 1-2 star rating public schools, less than 10 miles away you get 8+ star schools. I have been using ubnury.me to get a rough estimation of the time it would take with our current budget allocation + throwing a bit extra in. We are both pretty stable in our jobs, though I would like to cement a 6 month emergency savings. We do plan on getting married.

Me: $36,160/yr, $3,006/mo, $1,503/paycheck

Girlfriend: $35,650, $2,970/mo, $1,485/paycheck

After Tax Income:

Me: $1,100/paycheck

Gf: $970/paycheck

Essential Bills:

Mortgage: $560, 4% interest rate, balance of $58,000

Electricity: $129/mo, this is a level pay bill, is recalculated once a year.

Water: $36

Sewer: $16

Gas: $92/also level pay

Car: $470, Interest 5%, looking to refinance this in the near future, balance owed 28k, this is a newer car.

Car Insurance: $126, looking to switch within the next month, should be around $80-$90 Have to have comp and coll.

Other Bills:

Internet/Cable: $70

Phone: $70 (2lines)

My CC: Paid in full every month, usually $50-70. Working on building credit, as I didn't do a great job of this earlier in life.

Gf CC: $50, $1,200 balance, planning on paying this down asap

Sears CC: $25, $500 balance, no interest until June of next year, will pay off before any interest is accrued

Expenses:

Groceries: $400, this is a hard area for us, she doesn't enjoy cooking, and I don't have a profound love, but we both know there is savings to be had with food.

Restaurants: $200, we've cut this down substantially and reallocated more towards groceries, to give you an idea, we've spent 1k in a month on eating out in the past, used to eat out for all meals, have cut it down to about twice a week. There is savings to be had here still.

Netflix: $7

Clothes: $50-$70, I've just moved into a new position and will need to pick up a suit or two so this will probably jump up one month out of the year, but usually we do our clothes shopping in thrift stores. We both require business casual clothes for work, which isn't that hard to come by.

personalfinance,"24 - Out of College, Investment questions","Hey guys,

I don't know a lot finance and investing so I thought I would validate my investment plans with you guys. I also have a few questions at the end. Some stats first:

- Age: 24

- Student loans: $63k (~$40k at 6.8% which is the highest interest rate)

- Other debt: $0

- Emergency fund: $16k

- Base salary: $100k

- Rent: $0 (living with parents)

So here's what I'm thinking based on what I've read so far. I should max out my 401k and then pay off my loans. But I have some questions.

1.  Should I also create a Roth IRA? If I'm already maxing out my 401k, am I really going to need all that money when I'm 55-60 years old? Furthermore, I believe I will require more money within the next 20 years than I will need in 30 years so I'm a little apprehensive about locking up too many investments that I can't touch until retirement.

2.  How much of my earnings should I dedicate to paying off my student loans? Based on my plan right now, it would be almost everything not going towards my 401k.

3.  I want to buy a new car (let's say a luxury car) in ~2-5 years and a home in ~10 years. I want to save up money for this in hopefully an investment account that grows. I've been looking at index funds and am wondering if this is a good route to go? Can I invest money in these funds and just ""forget"" (i.e. just leave the money in there) about them until I need to cash out? Or are they like stocks where I have to pay attention every day (or week/month)?

I know what the answer will be. Why would you refinance to a higher interest rate? I've a car with $10k left on the loan. I had a 2.99% APR with a local credit union, and refinanced it to my primary bank, USAA, merely for the sake of convenience, to keep my savings, checking, brokerage and now auto loan in the same financial institution. 

What prompted me to want to refinance was a very threatening letter I received for making a ""late"" payment. (It showed in my bank account that the payment had cleared the day it was due, so it was a bit weird, when I called to clarify, the customer service wasn't that great either)
The interest isn't even that big of a deal, since I will be making the same monthly payment for the same amount of months, had a 60 month loan, and have only been paying it for about 7 or 8 months so far. 

TL; DR. Previous APR 2.99, refinanced to 6.23 for the sake of convenience. Please be gentle with the input. Thank you! :)",finance,1399089201

personalfinance,Should I buy a house or keep renting?,"I am trying to decide if I should purchase a home or keep renting?    Here is my situation.

Rented for the first two years since moving out of state.   Got divorced.   Now a single mom with 3 kids.    I share custody of the kids with their father - he has them maybe 12 days a month while I have them the other 18 days.

I have been renting for the past two years.   However, I have been paying more than I should because I need to keep the kids in the same school district.    They are kind of in a ""rich"" area.   Not my choice, but.....the kids seem happy now and that is all I want.   Just to see them happy.    They have changed schools two times since the move out of state and I'm not willing to change again.

I currently pay $1450 for a 4 bedroom home plus utilities.    I have no other bills or debt except for my SUV, which is $400 a month.     Because of the area where the school is, it's very hard to find anything for less.

I bring in $3,300 a month which is barely enough to cover everything after I pay everything, especially my rent.   I don't even have extra utitlies, I just have car ins, gas, electric, rent ins, cable, internet, trash, cell phone and school lunches.     I am always about $500 a month short, which I have to deduct from my savings account.

I have $13,500 in savings.     At the beginning of my divorce, I had about $25,000 - that was two years ago.    So I fear that in another two years, I will be down to nothing.

If I use the 30% housing ratio, it says that I should spend no more than $990 for my housing.    Well, I'm paying $1,450.

I have good credit - I think it's 787 - but my concern is that if I buy a house, I'm pretty much responsible for it.   I do not see my income going up for a couple of years.    If something breaks, such as the A/C, well, it's on me.    I just don't know if I am being responsible by buying a home.

However, I think it would encourage stability since I've moved 4 times in the last 4 years.    But sometimes, it's nice not to be tied down to one place, and also, it's nice to not have to worry about repairs.    In the last year, I had the furnace looked at as well as a fence repair and a few other things and it was nice to contact the landlord about those.

If anyone could offer me any advice, I would be grateful.     Rent or buy??    Right now, I am considering renting for another year at the same price $1450 a month or a bit less, so I just wanted to know if I am doing the right thing.

Thank you.

EDIT:    I left out one important detail.     I am looking into the first time homebuyers program which has a low interest rate and $0 down payment.    I would just have to cover closing costs, but there is a way I may be able to get closing costs covered.     If this does not work out, then I will rent again.    I will not use my savings to use as a down payment.",finance,1399140123

**THERE IS NO MEDICARE EXPANSION. PERIOD.**

There *has*, however, been a ***Medicaid* expansion**, which states could accept or reject federal funds to opt into, that now covers anyone making under 133% of the poverty line.

Medi*care* has not.

finance,QE3 &amp; Emerging Markets Reactions to Tapering,"Hi r/Finance, 

I am wondering if anyone had a moment to help me grabble with a question about the tapering we've seen for QE3 since January. Many articles that I am reading describe the large effects the tapering process has had on emerging markets' currency valuation as well as FDI in their economy. Much of the economic shrinkage that has resulted or is anticipated to result in these emerging markets is predicated upon investors dumping the currency they had invested. These investors entered into markets that were perceived as being risky because their access to capital for investments was so cheap as a result of QE1-3. If investors knew that QE was temporary, why are they all of a sudden dumping their currency investments and their presence in emerging markets due to the Feds announcement of a tapering policy? Did these investors think that QE would go on for much longer (or indefinitely) or is this exit strategy all a part of their investments in emerging markets (i.e, their investment was only for the tenure of QE policies)? Any insight is appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1399150250

We have a prime area that is being developed right in between both of our offices. The last area to developed in an area where most houses were built in the 60s-80s. The layout we want, from the builders option, is the smallest they have (supposedly good for the investment aspect?). We have absolutely no debt. We gross almost $100K/year combined. The house we are hopeful to get approved for is approx 340K. If we get approved, we will be putting down 5%. Estimating our monthly mortgage, insurance, taxes, HOA, and PMI, will be approx 2000. Our take home monthly is approx 5000 (after our 401/Roth contributions). Is this going to stretch us too thin? We are pretty frugal about most things, but this really is the dream home out of the gate. So cutting back on eating out and going to the movies will not be a big deal to us (plus it has a sick media room!). The shortened distance to our jobs will save about 200 a month in gas? Any chance we will get approved? We both have upper 700 credit scores, but my length of employment is only a year. Where do we start when it comes to getting approved?

investing,Effects of long-term financing costs on real-estate profitability,"i was wondering about the cyclical nature of real estate investments since the long-term financing costs / interest rates have a huge effect on the profitability of the holding of real estate. I am aware that there are several business models in the RE space (developers, banks, agents, managers, etc) but someone has to hold in end the properties and i think a lot of them are financed/leveraged. Suppose a longterm average of the cap-rate is 8%, then once you substract management and maintenance costs (maybe 2%) you would end up at 6% net. If the 15year interest rate is ranging between now at all time lows and historically up to +6%, are the times where it is not really possible to get a return on your portfolio? And then there is today, where it seems one should heavily allocate into RE (with fixed-rate mortgages).

Bitcoin,Hayek Money: The Cryptocurrency Price Stability Solution,"I've been working on the proposal for a cryptocurrency with an embedded smart monetary policy to ensure price stability

Last revision: May 8th 2014

Hayek Money: The Cryptocurrency Price Stability Solution

The Bitcoin protocol has enabled competition between digital cryptocurrencies and traditional legal tender fiat currencies. Despite impressive cryptocurrency adoption rate, dramatic deflationary price instability has thwarted affirmation of the cryptocurrency leadership. Price stability can be achieved by dynamically rebasing the outstanding amount of money: the number of currency units in every digital wallet is adjusted instead of each single unit changing its value. The apparent awkwardness of this new monetary policy paradigm is discussed at length, proving that its only real novelty is about fairness and effectiveness. The proposed monetary base adjustment has neutral impact on the overall wallet wealth, as it does not introduce any arbitrary distortion into the intrinsic value dynamics of the wallet. The adjustment is based on a commodity price index determined with a resilient consensus process that does not rely on central third party authorities. It is posited in this paper that a digital cryptocurrency adopting such monetary policy is Hayek Money, so named from the Nobel Prize-winning economist: namely the best money ever devised, the new good money standard providing stable prices for a new economic era.

personalfinance,"Hoping for more efficiency in my budget while I pay down loans, but I'm not seeing anything.","I've got a good idea on how to go about this as I've been lurking for some time now(far longer than I've been a member here), but I just want to make sure that I'm going about this the best way. 
I gross $40k a year base salary, take-home is $2,300/month after HSA, 401k and taxes ( I have both NY and PA state taxes withheld since I live in NY and work in PA). I do have plenty of opportunity for overtime pay as I'm salaried, non-exempt. I get 5-8 hours OT a week, on average which is NOT added into the $2300 take-home.  I pay rent at $595/mo, cell phones $200/mo (3 phones on a family plan), $111/mo car ins, $250/mo car fuel (drive 85 mi/day for work, moving not an option), elec/heat variable but should be around $100/mo since summer is coming and I turned the thermostat down to 55F a month ago, I'm budgeting $150/mo for food.

I don't eat out much, 2-3 times a month at $8-$10 per meal. I'm a beer drinker, but generally go to the store and drink at home for $10/week.

Car loan:
Amount still owed $3,660 at 19% Interest; $330/month payment (long story:needed something reliable to get to work and my SUV was only getting 15mpg and needed $1500 of work to pass NYS inspection.)

Student Loans:
Direct Sub Consolidation Loan Current Balance: $43,145.48  Interest Rate: 2.625%
Interest Rate Type: FIXED RATE 

Direct Unsubsidized Consolidation Loan Current Balance: $10,473.52  Interest Rate: 2.625%  
Interest Rate Type: FIXED RATE 

Direct Sub Stafford Loan Current Balance: $4,343.15 Interest Rate: 2.35%  
       Clearly, the car loan has to go away first due to the interest rate, and I believe that I can make that happen by mid-November, but more efficiently is the goal. Long story, but my mom owes me $1075 at the moment since I covered an emergency expense, every dime of that is going straight to this car loan. My goal is to be able to have enough set aside to pay the car note off when she can give me this money in November. 

Once the car is paid off, I want to get the stafford loan paid off next since its the smallest, and I'm not sure that it's a fixed rate for the interest. I'm also the type of person that will benefit more from an avalanche method.

I have absolutely NO idea how I got sub-3% interest rates, but I won't complain here. I finished school in 2008, consolidated in 2012. I was paying on the loans up until the end of 2011, but got laid off from work and was unemployed for 14 months. While unemployed, I stupidly let my loans go into default and just finished rehabbing them last month, so my next payment will be the first out of rehab. In rehab, I had been paying $330 a month for the loans, and my next payment is $327.23. I've not decided yet if I am going with an extended plan or an IBR. I'm debating over the idea of going for IBR so that I can get a reduced monthly payment, which should allow me to actually have an emergency fund building up while I pay off some of these loans. Once I get the car paid off, I'm absolutely rolling some of that over each month into the school loans (probably $200 of it and set the rest towards emergency fund each month).

Is there any room for more efficiency here, or is this about the best that I can do?",finance,1399217133

personalfinance,Would love an analysis of our financial situation,"Hello /r/personalfinance, I have been lurking on this subreddit for a while now and have gained a lot of insight about managing our finances.  I just recently discovered that my wife is pregnant with twins and I know that this is going to alter our lifestyle a great deal.  We have always made fairly good money and have had the luxury of being able to afford a fairly lavish lifestyle.  We buy whatever we want (within reason), go out to dinner each Friday and Saturday, etc.  Even with our high level of spending, we always contribute to our 401k, have an emergency fund, and never take on any credit card debt.  

I have made it a goal to alter our lifestyle in preparation for the babies.  I have read so many great analyses of peoples financial situations here, and would love to hear some feedback on ours.  Here is the breakdown of our current finances:

**About us:**

* I am 30 years old, my wife is 27 years old.  Married with no children, but we are expecting twins in 6 months.

**Income:**

* My income ($70k) + Wife's income ($50k) = $120k/year.  If we stayed in our current positions (i.e. no promotions or job changes) we would max out at about $90k+ $60k = $150k over the course of our careers.

**Retirement savings:**

* I contribute 15% + 5% match = 20% of my pre-tax income to TSP (Thrift Savings Plan).  The current balance in the TSP account is $35k.  I know this balance is a little bit low, I didn't start saving until I was 27.

* My wife does not have a 401k match

* We both have pension plans in place (I'm a federal employee, she is a city employee).  We will get an estimated $50-60k/year from our combined pensions at age 65.

**Emergency fund:**

* $17k in a savings account

**Investments:**

* $10k in I-Bonds with available ownership in one year from now.  I purchased these I-Bonds over the weekend because i felt that our emergency fund was getting too large and that we are losing money to inflation unnecessarily.  

**Debt:**

* House – $325k, just moved into this house a year ago.  Interest rate is 3.5%.

* Student loans - ~$35k between my wife and I.  We both have bachelors degrees and are earning income commensurate with our education.  We started out with a $70k balance about five years ago.  The interest rates vary between 0% and 6%.  We have been paying down highest interest loans first.
  
**Expenditures:**

* Mortgage &amp; escrow: $1720
* Student loans: $425 is the minimum payment, we often pay more
* Car insurance: $150
* Energy and city utilities: $175
* Gasoline: $215
* Internet/TV: $130
* Cell phones: $155
* Groceries: $450
* Netflix: $9

**Assets:**

* 2008 Honda Civic, worth about $11k
* 2008 Toyota Corolla, worth about $8k

**Net cash flow:**

* Net monthly income ($5412) – monthly expenditures ($3456) = $1956 monthly surplus
* Of this $1956, we put around $600 into the savings account, and spend the rest on eating out, entertainment, and other luxuries.  

So, /r/personalfinance given this information, what are we doing right?  What are we doing wrong?  Any suggestions about how to handle our finances?  I would appreciate any input you could provide.

investing,POA for my grandmother - need some advice about her assets,"Hello all - I've recently been granted power of attorney to manage my 87 year old grandmother's financial affairs. It became clear to me earlier in the month she doesn't have the capacity to understand her money - my grandmom and family agreed I could have the responsibility to run her affairs. (Mature and have the free time for it - hell I'd do anything for that amazing woman).

At first glance, it appeared as though I'd be managing her social security and savings to pay her bills and keep her finances healthy.

However, I keep finding assets that she didn't even know she had (nor the family). The biggest surprise was the stock that she holds. We always knew she got a dividend check here or there, but when I realized she was netting about $7500/year in dividends I knew there was some valued stock going on.

Here is what I uncovered:

- $10,000 checking
- $16,000 savings 
     
    (0.08% APY)
- CD 1: $16,000 
   
    (55 Month term, 2.96% interest rate, matures 10/2014)
- CD 2: $15,000 
     
    (12 Month term, 0.1% interest rate, matures 02/2014)

    100 @ $37.49 [$3,749]
- **Comcast Corporation**

    250 @ $52.03 [$13,007.5]


The total value of the assets is about $220,000 - and I can't state exactly how/why but she should be coming into $20,000 more dollars.

$240,000 is a large amount and to be honest I'm absolutely clueless what I should be doing. She has around $1250 coming every month from social security. Her monthly bills are pretty much zero - she lives with my family and we pay all housing and food expenses for her.

My POA duties are to safeguard her funds and to conduct sound investing for her. I'm more than happy to hear that sound investing is to leave the stock alone and not touch it!

The major point I think is she is 87 - with her amazing health and the average age of my family reaching around 100 she will probably live another 10 years (tough to admit, but adopting investment strategies on 30 year terms wouldn't be appropriate I'd think).

Last point is 3 out of the 5 individuals inheriting (myself, brother, mother) would be more than happy to leave our inheritance in a good investment if the other 2 wish to cash out. Not sure if that matters.

I anticipate having between $20k-$25k available at the end of the year that I can either use to pay down my mortgage or invest and earn a higher interest rate (this is after maxing retirement funds, I have no other debt, substantial emergency fund, etc).

Normally, this would be pretty straight forward (for me at least...invest and earn more), but I'm curious what you guys think about the value of getting the mortgage down compared to the increased interest potential.  I'll probably move in the next 12 - 24 months.  Thoughts?",finance,1399250944

To summarize.  I am getting married in two weeks and we will have a combined income of ~80k a year.  I will have 24K of loans to pay off.  We will have ~12k from savings to throw at the loans after having an emergency fund.  

We will also have about 3500 of investments at one financial institution and 5600 at another.  The 5600 has averaged an 8.2% return over the past year.  My plan, as of right now, was to try and use the 5600 or so to be able to pay off the student loans with a 6.8% interest rate immediately and the rest within a year.  Would this be an awful idea?  I assume that with Fees and Taxes and what not I wouldn't be getting the full 5600 out, but hopefully it would be close?

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 117 - Such RACEGOD,"Hey all, GoodShibe here!

If there's one thing that always inspires me about this community it's how we can get behind an idea so completely.  The fact that there's a group of people - now 80,000+ strong! - that can pour such passion and dedication into a single concept and then make it *real* out there in the world.

That's what we've been doing right from the start.

THAT's what we did out there yesterday.

In fact, if you stop to think about it, this is pretty much a win-win-win-win-win situation all around.

Literally no downsides.

A Win for Josh Wise and Phil Parsons Racing

A Win for the Dogecoin Community

A Win for Reddit.com

A Win for NASCAR

A Win for the masses who just got their very first taste of Cryptocurrency

For a whole mess of people, people who have no freaking idea what a 'Bitcoin' is, let alone a Dogecoin, they just saw us out there running alongside the big boys.  To them and to all who watched that race, Dogecoin is as real as FedEX or Coca Cola.  

We may be worth a chuckle, but we're no joke.

And when that announcer told folks to look up Dogecoin 'on the Google machine'? 

My heart skipped a beat.

Consider all of the steps that lead us here.  All of the amazing things that have come out of that one idea;  One 16-year-old having the guts to step forward and, with a ton of heart, making a plea for us to get involved.

And then, every step of the way, every 'Yes' instead of 'No', every post and tweet and comment pushing that idea forward.  Our own passion and drive inspiring Josh Wise and Phil Parsons to give us a shot -- and then for them to take it to heart so completely.  

Josh and Phil, thank you for believing in us and for going so absolutely above and beyond.  A lesser team could've just pocketed the money and did the deed, but you all worked just as hard on your end to make it an experience none of us will ever forget.

Seriously, that solo-pit of Josh's, that got us a solid 30-40 seconds of National coverage?  You didn't have to go it alone, but you did - and that takes both a lot of cojones and a lot of heart.  Thank you!

Throughout this experience, all speed bumps aside, we've been growing as a community making a name for ourselves as more than just a 'joke' coin.

Because - and I want to be clear on this, because it's important - almost any other coin could be doing what we're doing right now.  We're all based on the same tech, we all have the same basic tools at our disposal.

But they're not.

And they're not because the truth is that it's not just about having the tools at your disposal, it's about having the *will* to use them.

And *that*, consistently, is what makes Dogecoin relevant and important.

We're not just some lines of code.  We're a community.  

We're a force for all things good and awesome.

We're showing the world a whole different way to think about money, about the power they wield -- and what we can all accomplish when we work together.

It's why we're not going anywhere but up in the grand scheme of things.

We want the world to know our name and we're willing to do the work - good, hard work - to make it happen.

My friends, take a moment to bask, to enjoy this moment. 

Because you *earned* this.

We *earned* it, together.

And we're only just getting started.

It's 7:39AM EST and we're at 76.07% of DOGEs found.  Our Global Hashrate is holding strong at ~55 Gigahashes per second and our Difficulty is bouncing between ~670 and ~953.  

Of note, it appears that we had a massive, brief spike to ~333 Gigahashes per second late last night - not sure where that came from, or if it was a glitch - but it's interesting enough to note it down for future reference.  

**If you want to see the DOGECAR race again, please continue to vote for Josh Wise in the Sprint Fan Vote for the upcoming All-Star Race.**

Bitcoin,An Explanation of OKCoin's Volume,"An explanation of OKCoin’s high volume:

A lot of discussion has been centered on the trading volume at OKCoin and how it is “fake”. This, however, just isn’t true. It all boils down to the zero-fee trading model. Because we don’t charge our users any fees for trades there is a lot of HFT(High Frequency Trading) taking place. This leads to the “bloating” of our numbers. We have admitted this and our CEO Star Xu made a statement about this in a [Coindesk article written by Rui Ma](http://www.coindesk.com/okcoin-ceo-expansion-china-competitive-edge/) 

&gt;Volume has not been the focus of OKCoin for a while, he says, because zero-fees distorts it by a “large multiplier, maybe 5 times, maybe 10”.

There is an excellent [article written by Zhang Weiwu](http://cryptolife.net/the-0-trade-fee-in-china-and-its-culture-background/) about the zero-fee model in China which includes many examples of how this method of business is prevalent in China; the focus is on user base. For readability I’ll put some of his examples and key points below:

Taobao, the largest consumer market in the world, charges 0 fees for all buys and sells.

Baidu(Chinese Google equivalent) offers 2,000GB of free cloud storage. To put that in perspective, it’s 400 times more than Dropbox.   
However that’s dwarfed by QQ, which offers 10,000GB. All free of charge. 

The volume on OKCoin isn’t fake, we aren’t fabricating numbers. That many coins are being traded on our site. However, the volume isn’t indicative of the amount of funds on the site. The fact of the matter is that comparing sites that have 0 fee trading with sites that charge fees doesn’t paint a reliable picture. /u/bitcoinaverage phrased it well when he commented in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/246f98/china_merchants_bank_stopped_working_with_okcoin/). 

&gt;I think its a little bit of both, but we had to remove them from our system when they launched their 0% fee model. *It can't be used inline with exchanges that do have fees unfortunately so we need a more clever alternative :)*


Emphasis added by myself. 


So, to wrap it up, our volume at OKCoin isn’t “fake” it just isn’t a good indicator for funds on the site and for this reason can’t be compared to the volumes of exchanges that do have fees. 

Disclosure: I work at OKCoin as the Manager of Foreign Operations. If you ever need anything translated from Chinese to English, or have questions in general about Bitcoin in China message me anytime and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.",cryptocurrency,1399296120

personalfinance,"A few personal finance questions (equity vs. liquidity, and mortgage refinancing)","I'm a 40yo with a long-term professional career, a nice salary, and a healthy 401k. I have no consumer debt - only a mortgage on a new home, and some educational loans on deferment for a few years (earning an additional graduate degree part-time). I plan on working for at least the next 20 years.

At the moment, I'm sitting on a nice chunk of cash. I had been planning to sink half of it into the mortgage - the bulk of my mortgage is in a first trust, but there's also a second trust at a somewhat higher interest rate, and I'd like to pay it down.

The main obstacle is irrational fear about my income stream. A voice in the back of my mind is always making backup plans in case my employer or my profession collapses, if I suffered a health issue, etc. I have absolutely no indication of impending problems, but I still worry about the consequences nonetheless.

The concern pushes me to just sit on this pile of cash, which could cover my expenses for more than a year. I recognize that in the event of a crisis, I could sell the house and turn some equity into cash... but I've seen a few instances of people caught in a bad situation with a need for cash and a house that they couldn't sell.

Two further thoughts about this:

* I had the misfortune of closing on my house last August - according to Zillow, at the absolute peak of the temporary mortgage spike. Rates are trending lower, and I'm wondering if I should consider my options.

* I recently realized that this decision seems kind of inane. In both the best and worst circumstances, my spare cash will go toward the mortgage. If paid now in a lump sum, it would reduce the principle; if my income were to evaporate, it would cover monthly payments for a year. Ideally, I'd like the best of both worlds - I'd like to put it toward the principal now, in a way that would also provide the option fo alleviating monthly payments for a certain period (which seems fair, since I will be way ahead of my regular mortgage payments!) - but I don't know of any mechanism for brokering that option.

So I have a few questions:

1) How do I (or you) balance the tradeoff between equity and liquidity?

2) Are there any ways of putting money into mortgage principal that also alleviate future monthly payment obligations?

3) What's the rule of thumb on refinancing? What's the minimum percentage reduction that makes the hassles and costs of a refinance option? Also, is there a typical minimum period after securing a mortgage when refinancing isn't an option?",finance,1399310104
personalfinance,I really screwed up and looking for advice.,"Hello Reddit,

I'm looking for some help/advice.
I am currently buried in credit card/ student loan debt. Over $150,000.

I'm 27 years old, graduated college last year and have had no luck finding a good job. I've been in school since I was 18, never really knew what I wanted to do. Started taking liberal arts classes, tried a few different majors, but was never truly happy. I ended transferring schools multiple times ( 2 community colleges, a state school and a for profit - New England Institute of Art), each school having a different primary loan provider.

So I have racked up over $100,000 in private and slightly over $50,000 in federal. I'm not worried about the federal because I can do the IBR and be fine. Since I've been 18 I have also have over $10,000 in credit card debt, which I could handle fine while I was in school (actually HAD a 720 credit score).

My issue lies with the fact that not that I have graduated I have four private student loan companies asking me for a total of over $1700 per month, $400 in credit card debt a month and more when my federal loans to kick in. 

I was working a decent job in my major on contract and that ended, I fell behind while looking for a new job for 2 months and have had no luck. I ended up settling with a security job part time that brings in about $1600 / month .....which is much lower than all my payments due combined. And I still have to pay $600 in rent a month.

I haven't paid any bills in the last couple months because it's just kicking a can further down the road, it's not going to help if I just pick which one to pay, they all want money.


What should I do?  File bankruptcy to clear my personal debt and put my loans on hold? Hopefully find a better job within the next 5 years?

Or let everyone sue me? Settle with them and be on a payment plan for the rest of my life?

I am hoping to travel this summer and will need to borrow money to do so.  I could borrow money from extended family with no interest but that does nothing for my credit score.  

I'm wondering what is the best option for me to build my credit. 

Here are some details:

-I have zero debt.

-I have only had a credit card for ~12 months, haven't looked up my credit score yet but my banker thought it was in the 640-700 range. My family always taught me to avoid credit and only live off what I have. I don't even use my card that much (few times a year). 

-I'm hoping to borrow 10k. 

-My living expenses will be very low the first year and I expect to pay off the full 10k in 3 months (6 months max). 

-I can get a Line of Credit from my bank for 10k with monthly fees of 1% of the total + ~7% of what I spend.

-I can get a loan from my bank but am not yet sure of the exact interest rate. 

-Loan amounts from my bank are a minimum of $3,000


So, my main question is, which option will have the largest, best impact on improving my credit history &amp; score?
.

Should I...

(1) take a loan for $3,000 and borrow $7,000 from family? I assume this is the 'cheapest' option.

(2) borrow 10k from family and continue to use my credit card to improve my rating? 

(3) Line of credit for 10k

(4) Unsecured loan for 10k

I currently use Schwab for checking, and I'm looking at options for savings account, mostly online banks (Ally/Barclay/Cap360). So far I've been very satisfied with the level of service from Schwab, but looking at their APY interest rates are lower compared with the others. I'd like to keep it simple and just use Schwab for savings, and I would like to continue using their checking, especially if I'm only planning to have 20-30k in there. However, another side of me thinks I should go for the 0.7-0.8% higher rate (which can come out to around +$100-$200/yr). I've read both sides of the argument coming from this sub.

I could also use a combo of both (no fees), my only hesitation is that inter-bank transfers could be both a pain to setup and maintain (wait 2-3 days to clear). Also I would have to deal with multiple customer service lines.

personalfinance,I have a question regarding my credit card's Purchase APR % and what I actually get charged interest for.,"So, I recently used my credit card, which has a $900 limit to build a PC. Planning to pay it off slowly over time (not the minimum, a good amount to do it somewhat quickly). I looked at my last statement, and I am either doing my math wrong (which I don't think I am) or the APR is not calculated the way I thought.

My last statement for April, I am seeing:

- Purchase APR: 22.99% (v) (which honestly seems pretty damn high now that I'm thinking about it....

- Balance Subject To Interest Rate: $633.63

- Interest Charges: $12.37

Base on my math ($633.36 * .2299) my interest would have been $145. And that's a pretty high amount.

So I guess what I'm asking is:

- How is $12.37 amost 23% of $633.63?

- I'm clearly doing the math wrong, so how do I calculate on a month to month basis what my interest will be?

Thanks in advance!",finance,1399358538
personalfinance,I read all the time and I'm still not sure what to do.,"Hey guys,

First post here. I make about 52,000 a year and I have about $30,000 in savings. 

I'm selling a company on Wednesday and my share is going to be about $18,000 after taxes. I do have some student loans, but the interest rate is relatively low (3%) on them.

I'm not looking to buy a house anytime soon because I already have a mortgage that I make an extra payment a year on. 

On average I save about $300 from each paycheck and move it to my savings account so that's roughly $600 a month.

I recently opened an account with Betterment and I autodeposit $100 into that account. I did that to get a start with investing while not really having to understand too much. I've read so much though. I read threads on here every day and I've read everything in the sidebar. I still just don't know what to do when it comes to investing.
 
I know to use Vanguard, but I'm not sure if the retirement fund is what I should do.
If you guys suggest I open up a Roth IRA (which I think I should do) and max that out with a Vanguard fund, and then also open up a regular account and maybe purchase other funds with that one aside from the retirement fund? I'm just not sure what the smartest thing is to do here and rather than mess up I figured I would just ask.
 
I figure I have too much in liquid savings being eaten up by inflation. I'm just worried I'll lose all of my money somehow in the market - silly I know. I need to get my feet wet and slowly I'll contribute more as I'm more comfortable. Just - where to start? I'd rather not dump all of my money into student loans even though that's probably the smartest thing I could do because I'm comfortable paying them off by paying monthly - they're still in deferment.
 
If it makes any difference I am 23 and I have about a year left of undergrad. I appreciate any input you guys may have for me. Thanks in advance!

Edit: Also, I got a student trial of YNAB tonight and will be attending the free intro session tomorrow evening so that I can learn to budget and hopefully save even more of my income for retirement and other investments. 

Edit 2: As of tonight my Betterment account has a balance of $433.05 - $400 of which I invested and a $25 bonus for signing up along with a bit of interest. It says my earnings are 1.9%. My allocation is 90% stocks 10% bonds by the way.",finance,1399361085
investing,First time Investor looking for some help.,"So as the title suggests, I am currently looking at making my first investment outside of just regular saving. From what I've read I have decided that I am going to go with an Index fund, due to the relative ease of them, and the fact that I don't have the money or know-how to do much otherwise.

Recently in my country, the interest rates for savings accounts have gone up. I could be getting 4.25% P.A if I keep my money in the account, and I am trying to establish if this is a better idea than putting it into the index fund. 

It's currently a toss-up between these two:

Speaker notes that Larry Robbins has had some great ideas which he presented at Ira Sohn Conference. Robbins recommended shorting GM, which later declared bankruptcy. Robbins also called for buying healthcare companies despite Obamacare fears.

2:14 Larry Robbins said conference is good time to reflect on what we thought would happen and what actually did. Larry Robbins thinks that 2014 is not so different from 2013. He notes that the biggest difference is between the yield on corporates from two years ago until today. Robbins thinks that stocks are still cheap based on relative basis, especially with companies cash rich and having low borrowing costs. In terms of 2013 versus 2014, Robbins believes that opportunities are now harder to find and you need to do more work.

Robbins likes ‘convertible equities’ he calls this value enhancing events which makes a stock even more attractive like M&amp;A. Robbins notes that not all HMOs are bad and you need to see which bend the cost curve down. He believes the Government has helped in this regard. Despite the fact that HMOs have weathered they are trading at 10.6x forward earnings. The pain is in rearview mirrors and the sunny days are ahead says Robbins.


 
2:18 The companies will benefit even when interest rates normalize. The wave of new management has also helped, with UNH being the exception, which has a solid CEO. Humana (HUM) is a medicare advantage company. Robbins jokes that there are too many old people in the population. Humana is taking that share because seniors love Medicare advantage. The 2014 elections won’t matter because seniors like it. Humana has high top line growth and has ‘options’ attached to it.

2:23 NEarly every HMO has teamed up with a PBM. Humana is likely to do this in the next 1-2 years and could be accretive by 10-15% for shares. Humana can take on debt and even buy HMO or buyback shares, these could all increase value. Public exchanges could add up to 60 cents a share, other programs could add 90 cents a share. They could earn up to $13 a share which should be a 40% return.

2:25 Next WLP only sold part of its business for 10 years, they can buy it back in 4-5 years that is hugely accretive. Robbins also notes if WLP got rid of amortization could add $0.50 a share.

In utopian world we would all eat organic, but we cannot solve world hunger on organic basis, especially in parts of the world where food is scarce. There are very few other solutions, since chemicals are bad, and the best option is GMOs, which he believes are here to stay. In terms of economics, farmers make a 250% IRR and the world wins because we get more food and MON gets 20% of the profit.

2:27 Robbins notes that on the surface MON looks expensive, but when you examine it, the company is very cheap. The company is an oligopoly and compares some of the products to a phase III product in their pipeline which could add $1-$2 a share, 6-7% in growth to take it up to 24-25% growth. If you had a near monopoly in an area, Robbins says the biggest pushback, are you asking them to do something unnatural? If none of these things happen its 40%? return these only make it more accretive. Businesses which earn nothing today could earn a huge amount in 10 years, which is a nice call option on the stock. They can leverage, buy more, and have money to pursue even more research and spending.

Paul Tudor Jones RARELY speaks although he is a big philanthropist so that is likely why he is speaking at the Sohn Conference.

4:21 PM EST  Paul Tudor Jones’ presentation for the Ira Sohn Conference;is entitled “Manic depressive trading in a volatility-compressed world.”

“Macro trading is about as difficult as I’ve ever seen it in my career,” says Paul Tudor Jones, quoting the late Jimmy Hendrix.


 
Paul Tudor Jones at comparing it to “make-up sex – you got to finish to make up.”

What is the cause? Paul Tudor Jones says that central banks are the cause for this manic depression in markets.

4:25 Paul Tudor Jones Jones, who has had gaffes himself (including his comments about women being bad traders because of motherhood), just said his presentations are “about as boring as a Joe Biden speech”

Continuing with his slightly strange humor, Paul Tudor Jones is now discussing the need for “central bank Viagra.”

Now on to some economics, Paul Tudor Jones says that “realized volatility in G7 equity, forex markets are all at multi-decade lows”

In FX, Jones notes that 2013 ended with the tightest spread since inception of the euro. He asks If you actually knew when the federal Reserve was going to hike interest rates, what would you do in response?

With FI, Paul Tudor Jones suggests investors Wait until you see the whites of the eyes.

4:32 Continuing with macro, Jones says members in the audience were not born when the Bank Of Japan last hiked interest rates.

Jones notes that the first implied rate hike not until the middle of next year for the middle 2015, and mid 2016 for Europe. He suggests investors not short bonds until three months or so before each event. No interest rate volatility, likely means that there is no foreign exchange volatility.

Friday last weeks was one of the greatest days that Paul Tudor Jones can remember in macro trading as economic data (jobs numbers) were very strong , yet bonds closed up. He asks how can anyone possibly think/predict that bonds would close up on that day? This just goes to show that what’s obvious in macro is usually wrong.

4:37: Jones says that while “fundamentals will show you one hand, and in reality there are two hands.” Therefore, Jones started a flow of funds group

He says nothing that nothing happened in fixed income in first 7 months to this year,but investors will start to see changes in bonds when taper starts to end.

Paul Tudor Jones says UK bonds are probably a ‘decent sale’ sometime in late summer.",finance,1399382849

dogecoin,A hurdle I see dogecoin facing with regards to big companies adopting dogecoin as a form of payment (data collection related),"TL;DR: Databases are expensive as all get out to currently maintain, and increcibly expensive to change/update. IT is always understaffed, and behind on work. So, for the business to fund acceptance of dogecoin as payment, they need to basically have a guarantee that it will pay off for them.

------------


Most companies have huge databases to track any and everything the business sees as potentially valuable to them being able to make more money.

For example, why do grocery stores give those loyalty cards? So they can track what you spend and what you buy, and basically see every transaction you've ever made with it. Thus, sending you coupons or offers or w/e to get in you in the store more often, and buying more...blah blah blah.

The problem arises in how a database would need to be changed to incorporate multiple payments from vaious currencies. Sure, some companies are international, but rarely do you see USD sales with Euro sales in the same table/database. 

Also, because the transaction using doge needs to be verified, and tracked to a very specific number and such, this is an incredible toll on the back-end IT support team to incorporate all of these new 'variables'. Data from the source systems also may not be able to handle the new fields that would be needed, let alone the data warehouse where it ends up.

It may also have a significant impact on the ad hoc and real-time capabilities of companies. Not that it couldn't be done, but it does have an added cost. And anything that adds cost needs to have a vote of confidence that it is worth it before the business will fund it.

personalfinance,What is the better choice of use for my income?,"I'm tired of having no money, so I'm going to get a second job. This job is going to be almost solely to fund my car payment, so I have extra money from my main job to cover everything else. I have three different options that I'm willing to look at. Which one seems the best? 

Details: $10,000 owed on an F-150. Great condition, expect it to last a long time, but getting ruined on interest. $313/mo payment @ 25%, $125/mo ins, ~$240-$280/mo gas. Expected job will net around $600/mo 

A) Use the whole income to pay off the truck. Continue using my current job for insurance and gas. Truck ends up paid off in ~10mo, sooner if I get a higher paying job, or more hours. 

B) Save whole income, while paying off truck as I am currently. Purchase newer, more fuel efficient car in cash in about a year. Keep the truck for recreation. Insurance will go up slightly, but I can divert my second income to the truck and paying it off ASAP after getting the car, and the lower fuel cost will offset a rise in insurance. 

C) Use second income to pay off the truck, then save for a year to buy the car. Then use car for transport and truck for recreation. Again, insurance will go up slightly when I get the car, but I'll have paid off the truck, and once I get the car I'll be saving at least 1/2 my gas cost every month. 

It feels like, given the high interest rate on the loan paying off the truck is probably the best answer, but there's the possibility that the massive savings in gas ($1200/yr or so) will offset the difference in interest. 

I'm terrible with money and making smart financial decisions (which is why I'm looking at a second job, and in this mess to begin with) and not great at math. Can some more knowledgeable people chime in and give advice? 

I don't want to get rid of the truck, because I also eventually want to get a camp trailer. We do go camping pretty regularly as a family, and I'm tired of sleeping on rocks. Plus the extra room in the bed helps even if I don't get a trailer.",finance,1399398489

dogecoin,My pitch for a Ðogecoin children's cartoon...,"**THAT'S MY DOGE**  
  
**Log line**: An animated cartoon meant for children (but featuring plots and jokes adults can appreciate), a young girl receives a pet Shiba Inu her parents found on the side of the road.  In an attempt to teach her responsibility, they give her the dog and tell her she will also start to receive an allowance (in Ðogecoins).  Together, the girl and her dog get into all sorts of misadventures and along the way learn about charity, financial responsibility and the power of imagination.   In a twist, the Shiba Inu (which the girl immediately names DOGE) is actually a super-intelligent alien who has a base on the moon, and is reporting back about what he learns about humanity to a galactic federation).  
  
First episode treatment:
  
**ACT I**  
While driving home from work late one dark, stormy night, FATHER sees bright flashes in the sky in the distance.  Not sure what to make of it, he momentarily is distracted and looks away from the road.  When he looks back, there is a dog.  He swerves to miss it, and nearly wrecks.  He gets out of the car, mad at first, but he is taken by the cute soaking puppy.  He opens his car door and DOGE hops in.  
  
When he gets home, his DAUGHTER still asleep, he is confronted by MOTHER.  Initially upset that he has brought a dog home without consulting her first, she is swayed when she sees it make those puppy eyes.  FATHER and MOTHER discuss how having a pet can be a good way to learn responsibility.  
 
In the morning, DAUGHTER comes downstairs and they tell her about her new pet.  She is thrilled!  They tell her that it is a big responsibility and they are trusting her to take care of it.  FATHER also lets her know that she will now be getting an allowance, and he will be watching how responsible she is with her money.  The allowance will be paid in Dogecoins.  DAUGHTER immediately names the dog DOGE.  
  
**ACT II**  
  
DAUGHTER and DOGE go for a walk all around town.  DAUGHTER is trying to figure out what she can buy with her Ðogecoins and window shopping all through her small town.  With each potential option, she looks to DOGE and he responds with Comic Sans phrases (floating text seen, not spoken).  He is a simple, happy dog to her.  
 
They run into a group of other children, and she tells them about her windfall.  The children have tons of ways to try to part her with her coin.  One offers to sell her a set of jacks.  She passes.  Another offers to do her homework for a week.  She is tempted, but when she looks at DOGE, he seems disappointed.  She declines and moves along, not realizing that a bully has followed her, intent on stealing her phone and taking her Doge.

The bully jumps out in front of her and demands her phone so that he can transfer the Ðogecoins to his own wallet.  He calls her stupid and tells her he will spend the money on something more worthwhile then she ever could, and grabs her phone.  He starts to walk away and DAUGHTER shouts that he will never get her coins anyway, because she encrypted her wallet with a passcode.  DOGE is unhappy with the bully, and secretly uses his mind powers to form a thin sheet of ice on the sidewalk.  The boy slips and falls into a giant mud puddle (from the storm the night before), the phone goes flying in the air, and DOGE catches it in his mouth.  Kids who have been watching from across the street cheer, and DAUGHTER and DOGE walk off happily.
  
**ACT III**  
Eventually, DAUGHTER decides that she wants to buy candy with her Ðogecoins and heads to the local candy shop.  In front of the shop, there is a little stand set up for donations to a local animal shelter.  She looks at the candy store, and then looks at DOGE, torn.  He looks at her sadly when it looks like she is going to go into the candy store.  Sighing, she walks up to the table and asks 'Do you take donations in dogecoins?'  The woman at the counter says that yes, they do take them and they have very many animals that could use the help.  DOGE is very happy as she transfers her coins to the charity.   
   
When she gets home and tells FATHER what happened, he is very proud of her.  He explains the value and importance of charity, and compliments her on encrypting her wallet and dealing with the bully.  He refills her wallet with more Ðogecoins.
  
That night, while everyone is asleep, DOGE sneaks out of the house and into the woods.  Deep in the woods, he arrives at his buried spacecraft, and enters.  He fires up a video connection to the moonbase and reports to a woman alien, VEENA.  Speaking in an erudite voice with a stunning and intellectual vocabulary, he reports on what he has learned about humanity so far.  VEENA advises him to continue watching and reporting, and also warns him that their mortal enemies, The Intergalactic Bank of Doom, the most greedy manipulative organization in the universe, has been reported to have been seen operating in this sector, and he may need to look out for their agents.
   
He lets her know he will remain vigilant, and signs off.

personalfinance,Is this a good plan for my first year out of college?,"Hey /r/personalfinance, I was hoping to get some input on my plan for my first year out of college.  A little long, TL;DR at bottom.

I'm 23 years old, graduating college in a week and I begin my job mid July.  My starting salary is $65k and I'll be living and working in northern Virginia.  I was fortunate enough to have my college paid for by my parents and grandparents, so I don't have any student loans.  My only debt is a $400 car payment each month.  This interest rate is 2.9%.  I plan to keep this line of credit open to boost my credit score for at least the next 3-4 years.

I'm going to live at home for the first year and save some money.  I currently have $7k in a savings account and $4k in a Roth IRA.  Since I will be living at home and have very few expenses I was planning to max out both my company 401k and my Roth IRA, hoping that this will give me a little boost for when I move out on my own and can't max out my 401k.  My company will match 50% of my contributions on up to 6% of my salary or $3,000 maximum annually (I think this means I have to contribute at least $6,000 to get the $3,000?).

I was also planning on getting an HSA through my company and along with a high deductible plan and contributing the maximum each year.  If I go with the HSA option my company will also put in $600 a year.  So this would be $3,300 from me and $600 from them for a total of $3,900 a year.  I am in good health and don't expect to have to dip into this unless something major happens.

My company also offers a pre-tax commuter account.  I'm not sure but I believe this means I can set aside a portion of my pre-tax paycheck towards this and use it for taking the metro/bike maintenance.  I plan to bike to work as much as possible because my company has bike racks and showers in the office and this will save me a lot of money on gas. I was planning to put around $1,000 dollars per year to this account.

After taking out all my pre-tax money I believe I should be looking at around $2,500 a month of take home pay.  Now with $400 car payment, $100 gas, $458.33 for Roth IRA.  This will leave me with around $1600 a month.  I was planning on putting $1000 of this into my savings account each month until I have $20k in that account as a rainy day fund.  This will leave me with around $600 spending money each month.  

Please let me know if this looks like a good plan or if there is something I can tweak.  Thanks!

**TL;DR:**

Living at home, $65k salary, no real expenses. Savings account with $7k. Max out 401k, Roth IRA, HSA for the first year.  Save $1k each month into savings until $20k saved.  Take home $600/month after car payment/gas.

personalfinance,Boss is resigning....time to ask for a raise?,"Hi r/personalfinance I'll keep this as short as possible: 

I am 2 years out of college and I've been at my job for a year making $35k (at previous job for 1 year at $30k) at a 20-30 person sized non profit in Manhattan. In addition, I currently have ~$26k in college loans at a 4.8% interest rate which totals to around $200/month payments that I've been paying off diligently for two years. I rent my apartment for $800/month, and have no car ($112 monthly for the subway) or any other significant fixed payments, but have a pretty pitiful savings account.

My boss just let me know that she is planning to leave her position at the end of the month. My department only has three people, and my other co-worker learned that there are no plans to hire a replacement. Given that my boss is leaving and my coworker and I will be absorbing her responsibilities, I thought this would be a good time to start a conversation about my salary.

I had asked my now-resigning boss for a raise of $5k last week which is highly likely of being approved since our fiscal year ends in June and budgets are currently being formed.

I'll try and make this short/sweet. Basically my wife and when we first got married back in 2005 got suckered into a timeshare on our Honeymoon (MAUI), as most new naive couples may do.  We signed on and paid $30,000 for it.  (Friggin insane now that I saw that aloud).  Over the course of a year or two, we made payments, but realized it may be better to get out of the high interest rate and take out a home equity line of credit and pay off the loan.

This is what we did, and have been making payments on it monthly for 6-7 years now. To date, we still owe $15,000 on our second mortgage to pay this damn thing off.   Recently we've reached out to potential parties who are interesting in selling for us, and have a buyer.  They are offering $8,000 and will pay closing costs.  They look to be a legit company and I've done my due dilegence on that.

My question is....do we sell it and make an 8K payment on our home equity?  We will obviously never recupe the full 15K because of depreciation, but at least I wont be paying $1,400 in yearly maintenance fees as well.  The good thing is, we are moving within a year so this would take an additional 8K off what we owe, thus allowing us to profit a little more when we sell our home.

worldpolitics,Make Norways biggest bank pay Red Cross more money!,"To Norways biggest bank, “Den Norske Bank” (DNB), 2014 has been a PR nightmare.  The market rate in Norway has declined while the interest rate of loans to people and businesses are kept at the same level by the banks. This, of course means that the banks are getting a lot more money, DNB being the most profitable. 

The Prime minister of Norway, Erna Solberg, has openly criticized this practice in the media, urging the banks to lower the interest rate of their loans. DNB responded by sending a letter directly to Solberg, which was leaked to the press, telling her to shut up and informing her that they are not interested in any open debate of how they are treating their customers.  The letter ends with DNB telling the government that if they continue to speak about the bank will have to response in a more direct and specific matter, whatever that means.  

To top it off, DNB is in the process of firing 1500 workers in the next two years, stating that these cuts are necessary for the bank economy. At the same time the bonus of DNBs leaders went up with 37%, resulting in a total increase of dividend by one billion NOK. 

In what seems to be a PR stunt to get away from some of the negative press, DNB is at the moment paying 1 NOK to Red Cross for each like they get on [this Facebook-post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=716821211689541&amp;stream_ref=10) in the next 24 hours.

dogecoin,The future of Dogecar: How we can sponsor Josh (sort-of) Full-Time without losing interest from viewers,"Sorry for the wall of text, but hopefully a good read for those interested in another dogecar but skeptical about the money's worth.

So there's been a lot of talk about a full-time or half-time sponsorship for Josh Wise, and while everyone would love that, many people in the group who would love it won't think it's worth the money.

**The Problem**

To some extent, they're right. You don't hear the commentators talking about the amazing story of Denny Hamlin's FedEx sponsorship or Danica's GoDaddy livery, they were not crowdfunded and were simply another corporate sponsor.

So then the dogecar, they say, will lose some exclusivity, especially during a 36-race season.

It will wear off, that special snowflake status, and viewers won't pay attention to it.

Here's what I propose: 

We sponsor all restrictor plate races.

Restrictor plates are elements added to the car's engine to slow it down. This is necessary for the car not to lift off (and go to the moon) and go too fast.

This caused a lot of confusion since normally Josh drives a Chevy SS but for Daytona and Talladega he was driving a Ford Fusion because of said plates. 

There aren't a lot of these tracks, two in fact. Which makes them good tracks to sponsor Josh at.

**Paint Scheme**

However, sponsoring these tracks will mean we'll keep our Fusion and (some) of the paint scheme.

I do however hope for a somewhat more flashy paint scheme, as it really is hard to distinguish the car from a large pack in an aerial view. Maybe we should flip the colours a bit like the silver scheme: http://i.imgur.com/bY7Gpxp.jpg However, instead of silver make it white and the bottom black, essentially flipping the colours.

http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/092/c/e/render_team_2_by_widowmakerxls-d7cronx.jpg

Here are the cars side by side. I love black the most, but I think silver with added black would certainly be more attention-grabbing.

**The Races**

I would propose the Coke Zero 400 as the next race.

Why?

* It's Daytona, this makes it more popular than other tracks
* It's the day after the 4th of July
* It's approximately halfway through the season

After that, our final 2014 race would be the GEICO 500 in October.

Here's why

* It's Talladega, our 'home' track
* It's 500 miles just like Sunday's so lots of dogecar laps
* It's in Autumn/Fall so it rounds off the other two perfectly
* Josh has proven his skills here before. He's great an he got to 4th place at one point before losing the draft.

Lastly, there's still some time to raise money for these rather than constantly being in a hurry and then worrying about a lack of money.

What do you think, shibes?

Also: You may think that this is too US-centric. While this is true, it tends to hit US media and is relatively cheap to sponsor now, especially with our single-car team. Also, if this is a good way to get people to join the community, it's good, regardless of where every new subshiber is from.

Bitcoin,My rant about why I would rather use a bitcoin backed credit card than USD,"A guy named Chris gave me the beat-down for saying how great bitcoin backed debit cards would be.  Here is my alcohol fueled rantish response.

Chris, you make valid points.  I have had my credit card number stolen three times in the past three years, so this is something that is really a big deal to me.  I am extremely annoyed by it, most especially because there is a proven technological solution to this problem and the credit card companies are too lazy to fix it.  They would rather all of us continue to have to deal with this identity theft problem, rather than simply having merchants upgrade to a more secure solution.

Also, you gotta understand, that this whole bitcoin thing, it's a choice.  Nobody is forcing you to use bitcoin.  If you think it is stupid, volatile, lame, more power to you.  Keep using USD.  I have no problem with that whatsoever.

However, for those of us who want to support the global socioeconomic experiment which is bitcoin, then the bitcoin backed debit card is a phenomenal bridge to a future where we can use a currency that cannot be printed at will by a private central bank.

I mean, really, do you get that at all?  Do you get the concept of just how much it annoys a lot of people that the federal reserve can just keep printing all of the money that want, without end, and with zero control by the public?

You have no problem with that at all?  I mean, I get that.  If you ignore enough things, like a frog boiling in a pot of water, I guess you get used to it.

However, I revel in the idea that I can opt out of a the federal reserve note.  I, and apparently millions of other people, are so fed up with the federal reserve that we would rather use imaginary magical internet money based on mathematics than to use their imaginary magical US dollars that they can print at will.  Remember, they don't even bother printing it any more.  They too just go to a computer terminal, type in a number, and create money out of thin air.

There is no math behind their imaginary money.  Just a private bank which serves it's board members; all also for-profit private banks.

It's gotten so bad that millions of people would rather have magical fairy dust imaginary bitcoins than continue to support the federal reserve and fractional reserve banking.

So, by all means, keep using USD.  I implore you to use them all you want.  However, that said, let free people *choose* to use an alternative global currency which is controlled by math, cryptography, and consensus.

It's a choice.  Don't limit my choice.  I am so looking forward to the day when the only time I ever have to touch USD is to pay my taxes.",cryptocurrency,1399429817

According to my report, my score is in the low 600s. I am afraid this will be too low to get me an apartment and would like to know what I can do to fix this? 


Reason why my score is low -- I think?: I had a misunderstanding with my Federal Student Loans; I assumed I had the six month grace period like everyone else but this was not the case. About half way through the sixth month, without ever hearing from the agency, I called and asked about my bill. They said I have never made a payment and should have starting in May 2012. After this call they deferred my loan and then sold my loan to another company. Since the transfer and the closing with the old agency (March 2013) I have made every payment in full and on time. 


I have not been late on any other payments ever (private student loans, rent, credit card, utilities, etc.) Am I completely doomed to have this silly mistake hovering over me for the next seven years? Presently I am most worried about being denied a place to live (I am getting priced out of my current neighborhood.) I know I am going to need a new-used car in the next couple years, as well, and most likely will not have the cash to pay upfront. 


Bonus question: I do not see my utilities, cell phone, or car insurance payments posted on my CR. Do these companies report to another institution or do they only report when they have bad things to say?


Any advice is much appreciated!

investing,The role of Commodities in a Portfolio,"Bonds are the best diversifier for a stock-heavy portfolio. But after that, a small allocation to commodities offers real diversification benefits. Commodity-driven firms behave like equities during critical economic conditions. But a broadly diversified holding of commodities (or futures contracts) can offer real diversification, if not real returns on their own. The Pimco fund PCRIX  holds such futures contracts on a broadly diversifed set of commodities such as Crude Oil, Grain, Silver, and many more. The fund holds a portfolio of TIPS as collateral. Pushers of this fund say that this boosts real returns and gives you access to Pimco's expertise with TIPS as well as broad exposure to commodities. But look out for its 0.74% Expense Ratio on the Institutional class shares. The highest volume broadly diversified commodities ETF, DBC (I misspelled Deutsche Liquid Index so badly it was autocorrected douche liquid) has a &gt;0.9% expense ratio.

By nature it is hard to capture real returns with commodities but by that same nature they are a good inflation hedge. Their role in a portfolio would be a small allocation, accompanied with a lesser allocation to cash. Some investors would take on additional leverage. The idea would be that the added diversification benefits allow you to go for higher expected returns with the same amount of risk, when most people think of diversification as reducing risk while preserving expected return. This is an idea that has academic backing. But despite the multitude of financial instruments recently offered to the retail investor, we still have to wait for a lower cost option to emerge.

Bitcoin,Question for /r/bitcoin trolls. Do you believe people have a right to choose their own currency?,"Simple question. This is a question about freedom. Do you believe that free people in a free country should have the right to choose their own currency, yes or no?

This isn't a question or debate about the merits of any one currency over another. This is a question about freedom and self determination.

Do you believe it is the right of a citizen to decide which monetary system they wish to participate in; be it gold, silver, seashells, USD, or digital currency?

And, if not, why? Why are you against the free market and self determination of the human population?

Because, I'm getting really confused. I completely understand why you trolls think bitcoins are stupid. That part I totally get.

What I don't get is why you give a flying fuck if I, or my techno-geek friends, want to use it. Why?

Why do you care? How is it hurting you?

What if it was World-of-Warcraft gold points? Would you hound us as mercilessly then?

It represents a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the worldwide economy but you invest an enormous amount of your personal time and energy personally attacking anyone who promotes it.

dogecoin,Here's how we make a NASCAR sponsorship work,"There has been talk of a full time sponsorship, but it simply would be too expensive and that money would be better to donate to somewhere.

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/24vd5n/it_doesnt_make_sense_for_us_to_sponsor_a_full/

However, here's my plan:

Sorry for the wall of text, but hopefully a good read for those interested in another dogecar but skeptical about the money's worth.

So there's been a lot of talk about a full-time or half-time sponsorship for Josh Wise, and while everyone would love that, many people in the group who would love it won't think it's worth the money.

**The Problem**

To some extent, they're right. You don't hear the commentators talking about the amazing story of Denny Hamlin's FedEx sponsorship or Danica's GoDaddy livery, they were not crowdfunded and were simply another corporate sponsor.

So then the dogecar, they say, will lose some exclusivity, especially during a 36-race season.

It will wear off, that special snowflake status, and viewers won't pay attention to it.

Here's what I propose: 

We sponsor all restrictor plate races.

Restrictor plates are elements added to the car's engine to slow it down. This is necessary for the car not to lift off (and go to the moon) and go too fast.

This caused a lot of confusion since normally Josh drives a Chevy SS but for Daytona and Talladega he was driving a Ford Fusion because of said plates. 

There aren't a lot of these tracks, two in fact. Which makes them good tracks to sponsor Josh at.

**Paint Scheme**

However, sponsoring these tracks will mean we'll keep our Fusion and (some) of the paint scheme.

I do however hope for a somewhat more flashy paint scheme, as it really is hard to distinguish the car from a large pack in an aerial view. Maybe we should flip the colours a bit like the silver scheme: http://i.imgur.com/bY7Gpxp.jpg However, instead of silver make it white and the bottom black, essentially flipping the colours.

http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/092/c/e/render_team_2_by_widowmakerxls-d7cronx.jpg

Here are the cars side by side. I love black the most, but I think silver with added black would certainly be more attention-grabbing.

**The Races**

I would propose the Coke Zero 400 as the next race.

Why?

* It's Daytona, this makes it more popular than other tracks
* It's the day after the 4th of July
* It's approximately halfway through the season

After that, our final 2014 race would be the GEICO 500 in October.

Here's why

* It's Talladega, our 'home' track
* It's 500 miles just like Sunday's so lots of dogecar laps
* It's in Autumn/Fall so it rounds off the other two perfectly
* Josh has proven his skills here before. He's great an he got to 4th place at one point before losing the draft.

Lastly, there's still some time to raise money for these rather than constantly being in a hurry and then worrying about a lack of money.

What do you think, shibes?

Also: You may think that this is too US-centric. While this is true, it tends to hit US media and is relatively cheap to sponsor now, especially with our single-car team. Also, if this is a good way to get people to join the community, it's good, regardless of where every new subshiber is from.

I think that NASCAR can still bring in new subshibers and more value, if we do it properly. That was the goal with this project, considering we did actually get our logos on there.

personalfinance,"Parents are pushing me towards buying property instead of renting, is it actually a good idea?","First off im posting this from my phone so there may or may not be typos... 

A little background.... 

Ive been working at my current job for one year now and have decided that id like to stay with this company for at least 2-3 more years,  possibly longer depending on career opportunities. 

Now i work in engineering and gross about 60k a year,  i probably end up with 40-45k after taxes and contribute currently 10% to a 401k. 

I have a little cc debt leftover from my last post but that should all be paid off by the end of this month,  i used my tax refund to pay down the bulk of it. 

I didnt do so great over this past year for savings,  my goal was to save about 8k but i ended up with about 2k.  Ill be the first to admit i could be doing better but my parents are convinced i should have saved at minimum 15k, i think they are a little delusional about this number. 

Anyways getting to the meat of this post i told them the other day about my career plans and they asked if i was going to move to a different place.   I currently rent a condo for $800 a month and although the electric bills can be high in the summer i dont have to pay water/sewer/trash,  i get a 1 car garage to myself, 1100 square feet of living space,  and less than 2 mile commute to work so i think it's a good deal. 

They agree that it is a good deal but insist that since i plan to stay 2-3 more years i should buy some property.   They said that the mortgage payment would be less than my rent and the value will most likely go up so i may gain on it.   I told them i dont think its a good idea to buy property since i live alone and dont want to deal with maintenance,  taxes and other homeowner burdens.   
I think they are pushing me towards this because they see property krices going up and interest rates going up and think i should get something locked in before the prices get too high.   To me this is not a wise decision unless it happebs to coincide with me needing to buy property.   As it stands the only property in my price range would be a condo like i already have or one hell of a fixer upper. 

Another issue would be the down payment,  i need at least $25k saved in order to make a 20% down payment on a $90,000 property (leaves me with 7k saved after)  so im a good 23k away from even thinking about this,  i might be able to scrap together 23k in a couple years but its not happening overnight.   Currently im saving about 600 a month or 7200 a year so unless i ramp it up or get a hefty raise im looking realistically at 3 years. 

So a good question is why are we even having this discussion.   I guess my parents are convinced that i should be able to easily sock away 20k a year and i should already have almost enough for a down payment.   I know they lived pretty frugally the first few years of their marriage and had enough for a 40% down payment on their first house in 3 years. 

Is their reasoning sound or is their something i can point out ti them that they are missing?   I should add that while i appreciate their advice and respect their financial decisions i ultimately do what i think is best for my money, and i think they realize this.   But i dont want to just bluntly say fuck you i do what i want,  id rather be able to justify what im doing and demonstrate it as a good decision.

1st is bifold a) market conditions are still fundamentally weak as Yellen is saying, the costs for everything including payroll skyrocketing, while production declining, feds continue to print and buy back junk assets b) at the same time the market is toppy and highly valued. All signals to sell, sell, sell.

2nd is personal. If you have a long term horizon and stocks are your best alternative right now, do it. It's not for me right now, because of my 1st reason, but also, maybe primarily, because I have much better opportunity investing in my own business.

Before I get a slew of down-votes. I want to add I am tired of the lemming approach to investing seen in this thread, the constant throwing up of arms about time and valuations, always 'buy' mantra, and always buy etfs without doing any analyses of the equities or the macroeconomic environment. Of course no one can predict the right time to get in and out of equities, but I believe fundamental evaluations can be made. For example I'm not going to buy a house if it is priced exorbitantly. There are ways to figure out whether a house is fundamentally priced exorbitantly or not, and ways to determine macro conditions. Stocks right now seem overpriced to me, looking at P/Es but also looking at how fragile the future earnings of companies are, and how sensitive they will be to any negative news coming out. The Feds constant asset repurchasing is deceitful to true free market valuations. I'd like to see a significant market correction and then I may get back in.

I am 22 years old. I just got a new full-time job where I make $16/hr (~$33280/yr).

Problem:
I need a new car and I don't have credit!

What I Want:
Something I can have fun with. I'm young and I want to feel young. An inexpensive sports car or a motorcycle would do the trick. I do not want a brand new car. Unfortunately, my family and friends think I need something that will last for years to come. 

I would either have to get a loan from a bank or save up for a few months to achieve this.

What I Need:
A reliable, fuel efficient car. A newer model that is safe. I would have to add another monthly bill to my stack. However, I do not have credit so it makes it difficult to get a reasonable interest rate. My family says to get a credit card and pay it monthly to *slowly* raise my credit rating.

Hi PF! I've been lurking for a long time and thought that, with the news of becoming a default subreddit, now would be a better time than any to ask for some feedback.

I'm an undergrad student studying for a BS in engineering in California. My goal for the next five years is to pay off, or substantially decrease, my student loans, and to start saving and investing for my future. I'm currently at the tail-end of a year-long internship. By August I will have about $12,000 in my savings and checking accounts. 

I have just one semester of college left, and unfortunately I am currently unsure about the cost of tuition for my last semester. 

My finances:

My internship pays about $3500 per month. 

* $535 goes to rent
* $300 to a leased car. I know it’s not ideal but I needed one asap for the internship and didn’t know where to turn. 
* $144 car insurance
* $130 fuel
* $150 groceries
* $250 eating out/bars

I have no CC debt. My only CC account was opened this January. I opened it just to build credit, and I pay it off every month. Credit limit was recently raised to $3,500.

Here are my debts (all student loans):

* $11,000 federal subsidized @3.4% and $4,000 federal unsubsidized @6.8%	
I pay $160 per mo for both of these (the minimum)

* $11,000 federal @5%
I pay $117 per mo for this (the minimum)

* $16,000 Sallie Mae @8.625%
I pay $200 per mo, and my father matches this with another $200 per month, totaling to $400 per month. I think the minimum on this loan is ~$180.

These total to just under $42,000 in student loans currently.

I only have a few more months left until I get back to being a full-time student. When I go back to school, my monthly expenses will decrease significantly: no rent, less fuel, and less in groceries. 

Until that time, I want to maximize the money and income I have now to match the goals stated above. Am I doing enough to take care of my loans? Should I double down on the Sallie Mae loan and pay off a large portion of it or keep paying above the minimum? 

The above expenses are approximately what I expect to see after I graduate and start working full-time as well, so I would like to hear your thoughts on how I'm doing now too.

So today I realized when doing a credit check that I have multiple ""accounts"" for my federal student loans. I am still in school for one more year, so would it be worth it to apply to have them consolidated in to one loan?

I have always been under the impression that the federal loans would just be a giant loan and not many individual loans. From what I can gather, having this many accounts is a bit of a ding for my credit score.

What is your advice r/personalfinance?

Thank you all very much in advance.

personalfinance,Switching from employee of major company to consultant (self-employed). Need advise on retirement path,"As the title says, I am switching from an employee position to a consultant position (with a different company) and have no idea how to best continue my retirement savings or if setting up a corporation is my best option.

I have read up on the different retirement vehicles, and I am leaning towards an individual 401k from Vanguard (I plan to roll over my current employer 401k that I have with Fidelity). My goal is to put away as much tax-free income into retirement as legally possible. My take home income will be around $275k. We estimate our living expenses to be around $3k/month (rent, bills, eating,...all inclusive except for taxes).   

All of my wife's income, about $50k, will be used for paying off her student loans ($150k), her federal taxes, other payroll deductions and healthcare for both of us.

Is the solo 401k the best route to take? Can I combine it with other IRA options? Are there any suggested reading on how to best take advantage of the self-employed deductions? 

Should I just hire a CPA to take care of all of this?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my US student loans asap?,"It seems like people are getting some pretty good advice in here, and I'm hoping you all might help me decide what to do about my student loans. I'm 27 years old, been out of school for 3 years, currently paying slightly more than the required monthly rate for a 10-year even-rate payoff plan. 

I have a mutual fund that was a gift from my grandparents intended to fund my college education (but not specifically required to). Originally (in the late 90's) they put $11k into the fund, and it is now worth $29k. My federal student loan debt is now down to $27k. 60% of my loans are at 6.55% and the rest somewhat less. I don't believe that rate is guaranteed to stay the same. The mutual fund has had it's ups and downs, but it saw a nearly 50% increase in value between the beginning of 2012 and end of 2013. This year, growth has been slower. I live comfortably, but have no other savings or investments worth mentioning. I am about to get a sizable raise which will give me a few hundred extra bucks a month to save/invest/pay off my loans faster with.

I'm decent at math, but I'm having some trouble wrapping my head around what would be the smartest path to take here. I'm tempted to pull everything out of the mutual fund and use that money to pay off my student loans, but it seems like there's a decent chance that the investment could grow at a faster rate than interest will accumulate on the loans. I can also see how having lowish-interest federal loans could be pretty useful, especially if I happen to need to make a large payment for a car, down payment on a house, some unforeseen emergency, etc.

I understand that it's a gamble to assume that the mutual fund will continue to grow, or even that it will grow faster than interest accumulates on my loans, but it does seem probable. I'd appreciate any advice on what I should do about my investment vs debt conundrum. 

Part 2 of my question would be: if I don't pay off my student loans right away, would it be better to put my extra income toward paying them off faster, or should I find someplace better to put my money? I have no 401k or IRA, and my employer doesn't offer anything in that realm. I'm hesitant to add funds to the same mutual fund I'm already invested in, because I don't want to put all my eggs in once basket (the fund is all American companies, I believe). Any advice is welcome.

Thanks

personalfinance,I need help figuring out how to approach about $100K in student loan - any thoughts?,"Alright /r/personalfinance, I have a bit of a doozy for you and I was hoping that I may be able to get some sound advice on how to approach the situation.

A little background: I am a 22 (almost 23) year old who graduated college 2 years ago. I've done very well so far out of college and am currently earning about $100K/yr after getting a promotion from my $36K/yr position the year prior (very fortunate, I know). My loans are manageable - only $20K remaining and I pay about 2x the minimum amount monthly.

I am getting married in late July to my fiancee who is currently finishing up a graduate program - she will be done in mid-July. This is where things get interesting. She has nearly $80K in student loans from undergrad and graduate school. I thought they were closer to 50K until recently and I am freaking out a bit at the thought of getting them paid.

My personal finances are as follows:

$10K in checking
$28K in savings
$18K in 401(k)

As I said before, I do pretty well right now so after expenses ($1400 apartment, $500-$600 student loan payment, misc. bills, etc.) I typically put about $3K away per month - which is great. I put most of this money in savings and some into checking.

What I need help with is trying to figure out how to attack these loans in the next few months - can anyone offer advice as to how to proceed?

My loans: 

$20,000 Stafford loans at an average interest rate of 5.26% ($4,755@3.4%, $4,755@4.5%, $3,890@5.6%, $3,025@6%, $3,575@6.8%)

Her loans:

$59,500 in Stafford loans at an average interest rate of 5.95 ($4,400@5.6%, $3,400@6%, $14,500@5.41%, $35,000@6.8%)

$20,000 PLUS loan at 7.9% - currently accruing interest

I'm really welcoming any advice at this point. Luckily I have most of the wedding paid for already because this is starting to seem insurmountable. I'm just counting my blessings that my income is currently where it is... 


EDIT: Perhaps I have made a poor assumption here in believing that I need to pay my loans off early - I just assumed that was the best course of action in order to avoid another $40-$50K in interest over the life of the loans. Is that not the best methodology? Also, any advice on how carrying such a large student loan debt can impact my chances of obtaining a mortgage loan would be welcome. I assumed that it would be a poor decision for me to try and pay off a $225-$250K house while carrying this current debt.

Additionally, I am currently contributing 6% to my 401(k) with a 100% match up to 6% (100% vested immediately), so while I am not maxing out, I feel that for a 22 year old I am pretty happy with my current balance and am off to a very strong start.",finance,1399519679

The student loans have different interest rates depending on when they were disbursed. Because of the low interest rates on my car and my student loans, I'm not making them a huge priority right now, though once I actually have a decent emergency fund, I might throw money at them to make them go away, for peace-of-mind.

Income-wise, I'm going to be getting 73,400/yr paid twice monthly. I've been told that depending on company performance, I can expect ~8k/yr in bonuses annually on top of that, but I'm not including that in my monthly projections, and you can just expect that any bonus that I receive, 50% will go directly into my 401(k). I have no idea what I'll do with the other 50% of it. I'll find a use, whether that's stocks or processors.  

We can probably assume that, post-taxes, my net pay will be hovering around 52k/year, which turns into...

I'm thinking about maybe moving out on my own in the next 6 months, which would make my rent go up to around $1,000, and would also affect the price of my internet and utilities. I also need to shop for my own auto insurance, because I'm still on my parents' and I don't want them to bear that expense, seeing as I'll be making more money than they do. Assuming that I end up paying ~$100/month for auto insurance (I have no idea if that's reasonable or not), that leaves me with $2150/month that I have not allocated. 

----

Plan for unallocated money ($2150/month):  
$1400 - Savings  
$750 - Heck if I know  

---- 

The $1400 that's going into my savings is fixed, it'll allow me to build my emergency fund and, eventually, save for a down payment on a house (if I decide to stick around here for more than 6 years, which I calculated as the break-even point for buying a $300k house in my area).  

I'm sure I'll end up spending some of the $750 extra on hobbies and toys, but I can't imagine spending it all on that, so it'll probably either go into savings with the $1,400.

All of the outstanding debt has been cleared at this time.  The score has slowly been getting better simply based on time factor, but I'm finally in a position where I can actually take steps to repairing my credit (full time job with decent income, as well as eliminating some major expenses).

1.  I recently got a credit card (this past Monday).  It's very low-balance - only $300.00 @ 14.9%.  I do need it thanks to an upcoming trip to the United States.  I have already put a couple purchases through and paid them off (one planned expense that I had cash for anyway and an online purchase for which I also had cash).  Will making purchases and paying them off immediately (or within a couple days) make a difference on my credit score?

2.  I've also thought about trading in my car for an SUV.  The car will be paid off by the end of June (loan in my mother's name).  I don't necessarily want another car payment, but if it will make a difference, I would take on a small car loan (5-10k).  I know my interest rate is probably going to SUCK, but I can tough it out for the term (and pay it off faster) for an improvement on the credit report.  

Be honest - am I out to lunch?  Will either of these plans make a real difference?  Or is there another way I can start rebuilding my credit that I haven't considered?

I'm 21, I just finished my bachelor's degree, will be completing an internship this summer (from which about 95% of interns can expect a FT offer), and then I will complete a one year master's before I start my career. Due to scholarships and federal grants, as well as PT employment and a little assistance from parents (car insurance &amp; cellphone), I have completely avoided student debt to this point. 

Next year, I have calculated my tuition, housing, and living expenses (I'd rather not break this down because its sort of irrelevant) to be about $26k. After including estimated earnings from my internship, estimated PT employment earnings for the school year, and about $20k in savings in various forms (cash, old bonds maturing, etc) I will pretty much just have enough to get myself through the school year, but I would completely deplete my savings, leaving myself with zero debt, but also zero cash on hand at the end of the masters program as I wait to start FT employment.

My question is this: Should I just accept some student debt (I can take up to 9k a semester at about 5%) so that I can have cash on hand in case of an emergency, for moving expenses (I will be moving across the country for my job), things like that? I *hate* the idea of taking on debt unless I have to, but I guess the interest would be minimal (I would pay it off almost immediately after starting work FT), and I will be able to pay it off quickly, as I will be paid relatively well out of school at about 55k and once I am settled and making money I could use my savings to pay off the debt. I also figure this is a chance to add some new types of debt to my credit score (I've had CCs since 18, around 700 CS, limits range from $900-$8k). I really am unsure how to handle this situation.

My main culprit for money going no where is food. I eat out a lot, and when I cook I tend to go more to the elaborate and the costlier end of things. That is something I have identified, and have started to work to fix (including bringing lunches to work every day, rather than the 2-3/week I was before). I have also made some bigger purchases - ie/ a bike so I could spend less on taxi's/public transit (cutting my transit costs down to 1/3 which is taken into account in the above), and outdoor sport signups. 


I don't know what order I should start paying things down- the high interest rate card that I cancelled? The lower interest rate card that I still use? The emergency fund? If more than one, where should I allocate percentages? Is it reasonable at this point to set up a savings account specifically for travel, as that is one of my main passions? I will have roughly 6k over the next 6 weeks (with all of this month's fixed expenses paid for, but not next month's with this money), and I want to have a plan at that time.",finance,1399531464
personalfinance,"How much to have left each month after all taxes, expenses, and contributions have been made?","What do you shoot for? 

As a hypothetical situation, I have been offered a $60k/year job when I graduate. I have already paid off my student loans and have no other debt. What should I aim to have left over each month?

I'm assuming that, of the $5000 gross pay each month:

* 16% ($800) goes to taxes (live in WA so only have federal income tax)
* 20% ($1000) goes to retirement (deducted from taxes)
* 25% ($1250) goes to living expenses (I live on $800 right now so this seems reasonable)
* 4% ($200) goes to insurance
* 2% ($100) goes to transportation (I ride the bus, which is free from this company. Extra $100 in case I want to drive or take a cab a few times each month)

This leaves me with 33% ($1650) each month to do what I please. Am I missing anything? Based on this income, is that an appropriate amount to have left over? I already have $6000 in my checking account that I leave for an emergency.",finance,1399532721

personalfinance,Army-man looking to buy a home. Need advice.,"Hi PF, I'm a servicemember heading to a new duty station later this year, and my spouse and I have come to the conclusion that purchasing a home might be a worthwhile investment, but I'd like to get some advice. Military employment creates a unique situation where I don't really make enough where I'd consider a big purchase like a home on my base pay (30K/yr), but we receive a monthly stipend for housing (1,000 - 2,000 depending on the area). Options for this stipend include living on-base (they take the entire stipend and generally put you up in a decently-maintained home with all the basic necessities), renting somewhere (you pay the rent out of the stipend and any left over can be used to purchase utilities), or buying.

The reason we're heavily leaning towards buying is that we'd like to build equity and buying (even factoring in taxes/insurance) seems to be $100-200 cheaper per month than renting in the area we're moving to. This is not going to be our dream home, but rather a chance to get ahead of where we'd be if we rented. My spouse does want to work, but doesn't already have a job lined up at our new location, so I want to be sure this is an investment I can afford on my own compensation if she is unable to find employment right away. My credit is decent, I've had a credit card I've paid off monthly since 18, don't miss any payments, etc. It isn't quite to the best range simply due to length of credit history, but it is above 720.

With all that in mind I've been shopping around for mortgages and it seems like I can expect to pay about 3.3-3.5 % for a 15-year mortgage. We've been looking at homes in the $70-90,000 range, and our mortgage should be around $700 out of our $1,100 stipend. With military life you're unlikely to be anywhere for longer than 4-5 years, so we don't intend to pay it off while we live there, and we'd be selling/renting it out once we move away. With all that laid out, I've got some questions.

1. With our somewhat unique situation (we know we're moving) should we be doing a 15 year instead of a 30 year mortgage?

2. At that interest rate, are we better off throwing as much money into the mortgage as possible, or just doing the minimum and investing any other money we have into something with better returns?

3.  What are some of the pitfalls we can expect to run into as first-time home buyers? Things to watch out for?

Any further advice is, of course, appreciated.",finance,1399549719

personalfinance,Paying off student loan in 3-5 years VS. possible Lower Interest Rate Mortgage.,"Right now my family is torn.  We want to be debt free, but we also want to make the most sensible financial decision.  Right now I have 40k in Student Loan debt.  Using unbury.us I was able to determine I could pay off the loan in about 4.5 years and accrue about 5k in interest.  Here's where things get tricky.

I could consolidate my loans to a flat rate and pay over 20 years.  The accrued interest would be about 30k over that time period.  

Now if I were to wait to buy a house while I'm paying off my loans, then the interest rates on mortgages may go up 1%.  The difference in accrued interest between 4.25 and 5.25% on a 30 year mortgage for $200,000 is $54,000.

So my thought is, if I pay the minimum on a consolidated student loan, but lock in a lower mortgage rate then I will actually save $24,000 over a 30 year period.

Does this logic make sense?  Should I pay the minimum on my student loan in order to lock in a lower interest rate on a mortgage or should I wait 3-5 years and pay off the student loan now.  No one really knows where the housing market will be in 3-5 years, so rates and house prices could sky rocket or crash!",finance,1399554951

I purchased a home near the end of 2013 with an FHA loan.  My original mortgage was with Wells Fargo, and it was immediately sold to Chase bank, who I am currently doing business with.  I received a letter from Primary Residential Mortgage, INC, telling me that it has been 210 days, and that I am pre-qualified to refinance my new mortgage loan at a lower interest rate (from 4.875% to 4.25%).

personalfinance,"Against my better judgement, I'm considering buying a $500k starter home with $12k annual taxes. Please talk me off the cliff.","Well, it seems like it's happening: the masses are forgetting the recession and previous housing bubble and housing prices in my area are skyrocketing to pre-recession levels.

I've been holding off on buying a home on the assumption that things will remain stagnant in my area due to prices that only slightly dipped after 2007/8. My thought was that as interest rates rise, affordability decreases. Well, interest rates rose and so did prices. Shit. And they're still going up.

There are a few major trends that I think at fueling this by me:

1) Many first time homebuyers sat on the sidelines for years as prices stagnated / dipped ever so slightly from 2008-&gt;2013. As interest rates ticked up, they got nervous and bit the bullet.

2) A trend I'm seeing a lot of is that young couples parents are ""saving them"" by giving them a down payment. It's worth noting that in the area I live, it's common to live at home until you're 30. Children are watched by grandparents as two incomes are required to support mortgages.

3) A ""new normal"" mentality. People don't expect much for their money, and it's assumed that their half-million will land them in an OK house in an OK town with OK schools. House-poor on dual incomes is prevalent.

4) Entitled baby-boomer sellers are looking at their homes as a lottery ticket and listing their homes for insane amounts of money. If they don't get any bites, they don't get any bites and take it off the market. Supply is weak.

I figured prices would eventually come down to reality. I was wrong, and now I'm stuck. The fact is, eventually, we're going to need a house (rent an apartment currently). Against my better judgement, I'm considering dropping $100k on a down payment for a 70 year old home, and buckling up for a 30 year ride with $3000+ months payments and taxes that have increased 10% per year without fail.

We'd love to move to a cheaper area of the country, but we'd move away from all friends and family and we're in a situation where we can technically ""afford"" it here.

personalfinance,Help with filing suit against a debt collector,"Greetings, 

I'm not 100% certain that this is the best thread for this. I'm also engaging /r/legaladvice, but in my personal work experience I've discovered folks that deal with finance often also deal with collections. 

I'm pretty familiar with state and federal law, and yesterday I was contacted by a firm that is a third party attempting to collect on a debt for a business that I owned that went out of business six years ago. The call started with a person identifying himself as a civil investigator, explaining he was calling on behalf of a client. I'm a public employee and my name goes out on a lot of letters and I pretty much expect to be a party to a lot of lawsuits before my career in public service is over. So, I was pretty amicable for the first couple of minutes for the conversation. There was no mini-Miranda which is required by the state my phone number says I live in, and then suddenly the guy reads my social security number to me over the phone (not legal) so, I ask who his client is, and he's like ""oh, you don't know"" and goes on to tell me that they are sending field investigators to my bank, my properties, to talk to my neighbors, and anyone I ever did business with (not legal) regarding collecting a debt. I ask if this guy is a debt collector, and he insists that he's a civil investigator but that he'd take payment on the debt for his client. 

I explain I've never received notice from his company regarding the intent to collect the debt, or my ability to dispute the accuracy of the debt, etc, and I am informed that ""we are way past that point."" The individual then goes ahead and starts reading off things on my credit report, and so forth, to explain that he thinks I've got a lot of money to give him for a debt of $10,000.

I tell him I don't, and ask what kind of settlement their client is looking for. He says he won't ""bid against his client"" and I ask him if he's sure he's not trying to collect a debt, he again insists he's just a civil investigator.  So, I throw out $2,000 to see what he says. He responds by saying that the client won't accept $.20 on the dollar but that they probably would consider $.50 on the dollar. So, this guy is negotiating a settlement. Sounds like debt collection. So, after explaining to him that I was filing complaints with the appropriate agencies for his illegal debt collection activity, he refuses to tell me what state he is in which I asked because the return phone number he gave me and the firm he claimed to work for was in Delaware, and he was calling from a Maryland area code.

I then called the firm, and asked the receptionist to confirm that the individual who spoke to me did in fact work for the company and she refused to and transfers me to the ""CEO."" I spoke with the ""CEO"" and restated my question, and he refused to tell me if the guy worked for the company until I gave him my name. Again, no mini-Miranda stating that this was an attempt to collect a debt. I give him my first name, and they're clever, so using my first name and the person who I was asking about, the CEO gets my file out. He then states ""You are _____ _____"" and I say sure.

In the course of the conversation, he goes over details of my credit report with me, indicating that I have ""17 Ones"" and I should be able to get credit and tries to fish for additional financial information. I explain to him that I've received no notice from his company, nor from his client regarding this debt and that I was unwilling to really talk to them about anything until I received the notices required by law. 

I was then informed that did not require these notices because I wasn't covered by the Fair Debt Collections Act. He claims that the company received a judgement against me in a Maryland Court of Law back in 2008. I can't find anything record with my name from the last 7 years. I also couldn't find anything with the business name, the DBA, or the corporate entity either. They provided me the case number which doesn't pull anything up. I even searched under their clients name, and found nothing even close with their clients name as a plaintiff.

This guy then fishes for information, and starts asking me about a hot dog stand. (Apparently his google search has gone really badly for him, because he thinks I sold hotdogs) When I explain that I haven't received any notice, so I wasn't really comfortable with the idea of paying them I was then threatened with litigation and told that he has two piles on his desk, one for the courts and one for settlements. I re-state I offered a settlement to the first person I spoke to, and he goes ""Wait, you did?"" and I said ""Yeah, and he rejected it because he said it wasn't enough."" (BY the way, these guys quoted different amounts of how much the debt was.) I told him what my initial offer was to his client, and he explains that they'll get back to me.

Today, I received a call from the firm and let it go to my non-name identified voicemail, where they stated my name, the fact that I had a debt, the amount of the settlement, that it had been accepted, all in their message and that I had to call back right away, because the settlement offer was time sensitive. 

My basic question is does anyone have any advice, tips, or like an FAQ or how to for how to file a claim for violation of federal and or state (Delaware and Maryland) collection laws in court?

personalfinance,Should I be paying more toward my graduate student loans?,"I have roughly $140k in debt from grad school, for which my minimum monthly payments are about $1600.  

My take home pay is $5,200 monthly (I contribute the max to 401(k)).  I also receive an annual bonus, which I put toward home repairs last year.  No credit card debt (at least not substantial).

In addition to the $1600/mon in grad loans, I pay $124/mon in undergrad loans and about $2000 for my portion of the mortgage.  So $3700 in debt alone each month. 

I want to have those debts paid off! My grad loans are around 8.0%.  Some are Federal Direct, and will be paid off in 7.5 more years (about $1100 of the $1600/mon).  The remainder is a 25-year repayment.

To be honest, even with my take-home pay, I do feel like my graduate loans are somewhat crippling.  I just don't have extra money laying around each month for it to 'matter' if I pay extra (or so I think).

personalfinance,Only debt is 2 student loans totaling 12k. Pay it off or diversify credit report?,"I've looked around around the internet and I'm finding conflicting answers. My parents always told me that a relatively small loan would help my credit. My score is currently 788, and I'm 28.

I've got loans through 2 institutions:

Institution A: ~$8500 (split into 3 groups)
Group 1: 2500 @ 6.5%
Group 2: 4500 @ 6.5%
Group 3: 1500 @ 4.5%

Institution B: ~4000 @ 5.5%

Automatic payment through both institutions gives me a .25% discount off those interest rates. Each loan is scheduled to be paid off in 2018.

I have an emergency fund, I am contributing to my 401k and rIRA fully. I have enough in savings to pay both of these off. 

I've held off paying them off because most of the time my parents give me pretty good advice. Neither of them are financial experts though. My mother always stresses having a good credit score and said the installment loan would help. I am considering three options:

Option A: Pay off Institution A, keep institution B so I can diversify the types of credit I'm currently using.

Option B: Pay them both.

Option C: Leave them as they are now and finish paying them in 2018.

Now that I'm thinking more about my finances, it seems silly to let these sit if they won't negatively affect my credit score.

Forex,"Russia, Ukraine, and Forex Trading","Adapted from my blog. Original post May 2, 2014.

One of the biggest advantages of trading forex is that global political events often turn themselves into excellent market opportunities. Take, for instance, the turmoil in Ukraine. As the instability in that region grows, and capital flows out of Russia seeking safer havens, such opportunities are on the horizon. If you’re not familiar with what has been happening there, here’s a brief rundown of the past few months.


**Putin Outplays the West**


February 22nd- Ukranian President Viktor Yanyukovich is removed from office and flees the country.

March 21st- Following weeks of protests for secession, Russia annexes the ethnically Russian Ukranian region of Crimea. The US immediately sanctions several prominent Russian politicians and business leaders.

April 4th(ish)- Russia masses 40,000 troops on Ukraine’s Eastern border.

April 25th- Russia raises the ruble’s interest rate to 7.5%.

May 2nd- Ukrainian army forces clash with pro-Russian separatists in the Eastern cities of Odessa and Slovyansk.


**What Happens Next?**


Amid all the sabre-rattling and mindless media coverage, one can discern a pattern to Russia’s behavior in Ukraine that has been used recently in other conflicts. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and all but annexed the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossettia. Putin then employed a similar strategy of fostering political unrest before invading the region to ‘liberate’ ethnic Russian populations, and repeated the process in Crimea. It stands to reason he will do so again in Ukraine’s industrial, and Russian speaking east.

This is assuming Putin doesn’t fear the threat of economically damaging and sweeping sanctions from the West. After all, Russia’s largest exports – oil and natural gas – have willing buyers in India and China, if not Eastern Europe. Putin has been in power for 14 years in Russia – long enough to turn his gaze beyond domestic squabbling and toward a more global stage, and the short term pain these sanctions would cause may not be enough to deter his advance.


**So Where Is the Trade?**


There are two outcomes I see as likely. Both offer excellent trades in the near future.

1) Russia invades Ukraine, or continues to support pro-separatist rebels in the east. This prompts expansive Western sanctions on May 25th and the ruble continues its decline. Investors will flock to more stable, high-yielding currencies like the NZD and to a lesser extent the TRY (whose issues will pale in comparison to the ruble), providing extended carry-trade opportunities for speculators.

2) Russia somehow avoids Western sanctions and looks to attract foreign investment once more with the ruble’s tasty 7.5% interest rate. Short USD/RUB will become an attractive mid-term trade as the ruble bounces back from its long decline of early this year.

Either way, opportunity is on the horizon! We will certainly be keeping an eye on the events in Ukraine to determine where best to invest our capital, and will keep you updated on the blog and twitter as the situation unfolds.

personalfinance,"My husband and I suck at money, but we finally have some. Please help!","Hey guys!

So, my husband (28) and I (24) are really bad at anything regarding money. Until recently, we never really held jobs at the same time. We have no savings and quite a lot of debt. The good news is we're **finally** at a point where we're both working and getting caught up.  We're going to have some spare income and I don't want to fxck this up.  I don't even know where to start, but I want our money situation to be more better and I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING PLEASE HELP US.

Currently, we keep our money in two separate accounts but we really just treat it like one account. This hasn't been very efficient at all. We're setting up a joint checking account and a savings account with a credit union next payday to help manage this mess. Here's a breakdown of our finances. 
   
* Wages: About $50k (gross) together. I make about $27k and he makes about $22k.  
* Take Home Pay: About $3400/month (we bring home about $1600 total per pay period and get paid every two weeks).    
* Healthcare/Dental/Vision: Provided by the company we work for, taken out before take home pay number above.
* Car Loan: $6,000 owed in principal. Horrible interest rate (13%) but I've been late and had it repossessed so I doubt I can refinance. Probably another 2 years to pay it off. We only have one car.
* School Loan Debt: estimated about $25k, but I'm not 100% sure. It's all from me and I don't even have a degree from it. My loans have defaulted. My wages are not being garnished but my tax return was taken last year to pay for one of the loans. That loan specifically is about $13k, but I also have others.   
   * I want to go back to school ASAP but I owe the community college $1100 before I can return. I'm hoping to get my school loans deferred when I go back and I think that's possible but I'm not sure because they have defaulted.
* Other Debt: ~$10k approximately (together). Most of it is from ~4 years ago. Some of it is medical. Neither of us have credit cards. It's mostly stuff like disconnected cell phones and overdraft fees from old bank accounts.    

We don't really pay on any of our debt right now, but I'd like to pay off at least the banks that we owe for overdraft fees (about $1000 between multiple banks). Here's what our monthly income and expenses look like right now, bad habits included.    

[ Estimated Monthly Income &amp; Expenses ]

* Income: $3400    
* Rent: $850 - We rent an apartment. This includes water, sewage, trash and cable which they force us to have.
* Car Payment: $325 - I'm behind right now, so I have to pay $700 next payday.
* Car Insurance: $120
* Cell Phone: $125 - This is a little more than I'd like to pay, but it's on my mom's plan and I pay part of her bill because I owe her for her help over the last few years.
* Groceries: $550
* Electric: $150 - We got really behind so we had to set up a payment plan.
* Fuel: $175
* Internet: $60
* Cigarettes - $175 - We're getting ecigs next payday so hopefully this number will go down considerably.
* Medical: $125 - I go to therapy twice a month and have meds that I have to take.
* Entertainment: $200 - This includes things like Spotify, Netflix, going out to eat/to the bar, buying things we don't really need. 
* Other: $100 - This includes general upkeep of the apartment and ourselves. Things that I would consider necessities or long term ""investments"" (cleaning the carpets, buying a food processor, getting a haircut, etc.). 

[ Annual Income ]

He gets about $1000 for his tax return. We get anywhere from $250 - $1000 in March and $2000 in Christmas Bonuses each year. The amounts are our bonuses together. The bonuses aren't guaranteed but they haven't missed a year in the 3 years I've been there.


[ Goals ]

I just want to have a little money in savings for emergencies and be able to get my husband a car around the beginning of next year. I don't want to kill ourselves doing it or be one of those people that has all their money in savings and refuses to spend anything ever. Super long term, I'd like to buy a house - maybe in about 5-6 years.

Once we're caught up (should be in the next month if we don't mess this up), we'll have about $450/month that we can put in savings/use for debt/etc. and I don't want to waste it. I'm super open to suggestions but try to keep it constructive. Neither of us have ever learned how to manage our finances and we're still pretty bad at it but we want to learn. Thanks in advance! :)

Sorry about the length of the post. &lt;3

EDIT: I appreciate all the replies, everyone! A lot of my debts fall off in a few years and almost all of them are from joint accounts/leases with my ex. I no longer have contact with him so I'm not sure what to do about that. He's almost definitely not going to pay on them. It sounds like it would take my husband and I about 5 years to pay off all the debt and a lot of our debts expire in 2-3 years. Just adding this to take into consideration.

EDIT: I added a super long comment with some stuff I planned out and if someone would like to help me review it and come up with a plan for groceries and debt repayment, I'd be eternally grateful. Some of you were really helpful and I appreciate that a lot. Others, not so much. &gt;_&gt;",finance,1399614903

I have found, over the past year or so, several great links and conversations in this sub, that have kept me engaged for a long time.

But, seriously, guys, what the fuck is going on?

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/) has comments so bad that they make me question my own sanity. I don't want to draw the inevitable r/politics comparison, especially since a lot of these comments aren't so much politicized as just plain stupid. From pot shot ad hominems to a clear misunderstanding of economics, finance, or general investing practices, it's a shitshow.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdghmp) we're told hedge funds aren't as useful as Wal-Mart because, I guess, Wal-Mart sells physical stuff. So, yeah, I guess Reddit (and Microsoft and Linux and fucking Adobe) are worthless because they don't sell physical stuff.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdlajd) we're urged to wonder whether the Federal Reserve has directly bailed out hedge funds. No evidence, just baiting. And for proof, the poster links to a Salon article about NAFTA.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdgb53) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdkz0v) we're told how Krugman is a hypocrite for criticizing rich hedge fund managers because he makes $250k per year. ZOMG SO MUCH MONEY! Of course that's about 200x smaller than the sums Krugman is talking about (and his income is irrelevant, since he's pro-capitalist in any case), but he obviously makes more than these basement dwellers, so time to be snarky, amirite?

For an added bonus, that second quote suggests that hedge fund managers deserve their money because at least they're being paid voluntarily, whereas teachers are being paid involuntarily through taxes. Beyond the mind-numbing stupidity of this is the irrelevance when discussing Krugman, who has worked at a private institution for years.

Then we've got [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdgc01) insisting that monetary expansion is a de facto benefit to all hedge funds, which of course ignores the fact that hedge funds often bet against one another, some are hurt by monetary policy expansion, and others have directly lost millions betting that QE would impact the economy one way when it caused the opposite to happen.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdi23l) is some more snark that contributes nothing. [And some more](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/253ma6/paul_krugman_now_thats_rich_last_year_the_25/chdfy73).

Given I know little about investing, at least to make a decent profit, I'm very likely going the route of a financial adviser and friend my parents use that has proven himself to have massive success. I have almost 80k in my personal savings account, in which I get 2.5% interest on the first 50k (which is good for a bank but could be way better). I also have 43k in my 401k, of which 40k is in my old company and about to roll over to an IRA. I'm currently thinking of letting my financial adviser control all 40k in my future IRA and an additional 40k from my personal savings account. I do plan on buying a home in the next few years but will still be able to put down a hefty down payment and get a decent size loan from the bank.

Am I giving too much to my adviser, not enough, or the right amount?

She had just gotten a 50cent per hour raise, but somehow even with the pay increase, her take home pay is LESS per week than it was before. Is this right?

Breakdown of my debt:

Grad Plus Loans - Unsubsidized $43k at 7.9%

Stafford Loans - Subsidized $5k at 3.4%, $5,5k at 4.5%, $4,5k at 5.6%, $4,5k at 6.0%, $3,5k at 6.8% and Unsubsidized $54,7k at 6.8%

Total college loans 124k due to some interest. ($1500 monthly payment)

Credit card #1 $4k at 24.5%, #2 $12k at 15.99%, #3 $21k at 11.24% ($900 minimum monthly).  I already called all my credit cards and my requests to lower my APR were all denied.

1) My employer provides a Thrift Saving Plan with a match of 5% I believe. Should I contribute 5% of salary to it and throw the rest at my highest interest credit cards?

2) I have an old 401k from CREF that has a little over 20k in it, should I transfer it over to the Thrift Saving plan and then try to take out a loan and pay off the highest interest rate cards?

3) Take a loan from credit union at work and pay off the cards?

4) Defer college loans for 6 months and try to repay at least one card while only paying interest on the loans?

Not sure what my take home pay will be but I assume around $4500, with $1500 going to living expenses which should leave me around $3k to throw at my debt. My goal is to pay off the two higher APR credit cards ASAP as that will give me another $500 a month to work with.

personalfinance,"Prepay students loans, refi mortgage, or both?","Meeting with our advisor next week but wanted to get a broader perspective on this basic question: should we prepay our student loans, refi the house, or find a way to do both? 

Here are the particulars:

**We are a** middle-aged (40s) professional couple, $105K AGI, great job security, little/no chance for promotion, about $250K in 401K, credit scores 820+, two kids &amp; saving modestly for college in five years/nine years



**The mortgage**: tax value $225K, owe $165K at 5% on a 30 with 26 years to go...payment is $953/month (P&amp;I). Our simple options are:

* refi to 4% on a new 30, P&amp;I drops to $811, or 3.75% with 1pt and $764/month

* refi to 15 at 3.375% for $1,169/month, or 3% with 1pt and $1,139/month

Obviously these all will save money and we'll be in the house at least ten more years (until youngest moves out) if not 15. We live in a cheap area; the house is large (5 BD/5BA) and ten years old so our next move will be to a smaller place.


**The student loans** are another matter. We have six degrees between us, all necessary for our careers (we're academics). At this point we have $65K in loans outstanding at 5.15% on an extended repayment plan, so 19 years to go (and a lot of interest) with payments at $520/month (these are federal direct consolidation loans).  There are lots of options to refinance those as well, but we're looking at just making extra payments to wrap these up. Options are:

* current plan will pay off in 17 years, for a total of $98,000 (and $32K in interest)

* we can increase the payments to $1,250 and pay it off in five years, for a total of $74,000 (and $8,900 in interest), saving about $24K in interest


**The clear answer, I suppose, is to do both**; refi to a 15 and increase the student loan payments to $1250. But I'm not sure we can cover an additional $1,000/month given the increasing expenses of our family and need to save more for college and retirement.  It would be most comfortable to refi to another 30 at 4%, which would drop the mortgage payment $140 and then apply that savings to the student loans, adding a net monthly prepay of ~$750 and paying them off in five years. But there are other options available...we could refi to a 15 @ 3.375%, then increase the student loans by something less than $750, thus extending the term past five years, etc.

My main goal is really to have our loans paid off by the time our oldest starts college in five years. Should we work toward that goal, even if it means not refinancing the house to a 15?

* I have a pension program through work that I contribute 5% towards (~$2,500 per year), employer contributes 8%.
* My credit score through TransUnion is 675, and from Experian 709

I'm looking for some advice on how to dig myself out of this hole. I am surviving fine, but I really don't have much money left over at the end of the month, so I haven't really been saving. This hit me hard when my car's transmission died recently, but I managed to scrape together $5-6K, including $2500 from my tax return. Basically whatever money I have left over, I put towards my loans, the higher interest ones first. I have been looking into refinancing/consolidating some/all of my student loans, but there seem to be very few options out there, especially options that would actually reduce my interest rate. Any recommendations?

Thanks!

personalfinance,Student Loan Attack Plan,"Hello all. I am in the fortunate position to be graduating from law school with gainful employment and only $80k in student loans.  That said, $80k is still substantial so I am curious about people's thoughts on attacking that number.

Employment is as follows: I will be completing a one year judicial clerkship beginning in September 2014.  The pay is roughly $60k and happily in a state with no income tax and low cost of living.  In the fall of 2015 I have an accepted offer to join a top-tier large law firm in New York City or Washington DC. Pay will start at $170,000 plus a one-time $50,000 bonus for the clerkship plus additional bonus compensation.

I am hoping to get a sense of what it will be possible to contribute towards the debt during my first year without hating my lifestyle and additionally whether or not it would be wise to contribute to tax-sheltered accounts during that time period. 

Once beginning the second job I will attempt to follow the collective wisdom of emergency fund, maxed out 401k and the remainder to eradicate debt as quickly as possible--hopefully within the first year and a half at the firm.

Are there any other issues that I should consider in relation to the dramatically different compensation from year 1 to years 2+? And finally one of my loans, about $12k, has a 7.9% interest rate and the remainder is 6.8%.  Would it be possible to find private loans at a lower rate and is this advisable?  The only benefit I see to federal loans is the access to loan forgiveness programs which it is unlikely I qualify for. Perhaps this isn't worth the trouble but it is something I'd like to consider if advantageous.

Thanks for any advice!",finance,1399656957

personalfinance,Financial Plan (26 male and 25 female),"Hi All,

Just wanted someone else to take a look at the financial plan for myself and fiancee that I have drafted up.  Below are the details and thanks in advance.

Getting married in September and really looking to nail down a budget for us moving forward.  The plan is to look at buying a house in late 2014 or early 2015 and kids maybe around the end of 2015. 

**Debt**

* Car loan - $8700 @ 4.5% with monthly of $235 and 36 months to go.
* Education Loan - $3700 with monthly of $50 and I think like 7 years to go if I just make the $50 dollar payments.

**Assets**

* 2012 Car - ~$15000
* 2007 Car - ~$9000
* Investment account - ~$110,000
* 401(k) - ~$20,000
* Savings - ~$5,000
* IRA - none

**Income**

* Salaries - $82,000 and $39,000 - Expecting to get ~2.5% a year at least, with 20% bump in the larger salary within 2-3 years.
* Bonuses - $2500 (75% likelihood) and $500 (90% likelihood)

**Retirement Savings Plan**

* 401(k) - Plan is to max this out.  My company allows me to do 18% with a 9% match and typically a 3%-5% annual profit sharing match.  My spouse's company has no cap and a 6% match.  

$82,000 * 18% = $14,760 into 401(k) yearly, which means take home before tax from my salary will be $67,240.
$39,000 - $17,500 (capping out her 401(k)) = $21,500 in take home pay.

Annual 401(k) contributions in total = $14,760 + $17,500 + $82,000 * .09 + $39,000 * .06 + $82,000 *.03 = $44,440

* IRA - Plan is to contribute anything we have left over from this budget at the end of the year into a Roth IRA.  So this could be potentially 0.  

**Monthly Budget**
 
* Take home income after taxes - ($67,240 + $21,500) * 73.5%= $65,223 after tax take home a year.  Lets assume that 73.5% is the rate of take home pay after social, fed, local, state, medicare, and company healthcare is factored in. 

* Bi-weekly paycheck - $65,223/26 periods = $2,508.
* Guaranteed 2 periods a month, so monthly income is $2,508 *2 = $5,016

* Rent - $1,300
* Electric/Gas - $200
* Cable/Internet - $140
* Car gas - $380
* Car loan - $235
* Edu loan - $50
* Phone bill - $160
* Groceries - $400
* Combined misc expenses a.k.a anything we do **together**, like going to happy hours, dinners, small trips, etc... - $400
* Personal misc expenses a.k.a golf, happy hours without her, dinner without her, my lunch, her hair stuff, etc... - $25/day each - $700 out of each paycheck.

$5,016 - $1,300 - $200 - $140 - $380 - $235 - $50 - $160 - $400 - $400 - $1400 = $351 leftover, which can be our monthly buffer.

Anything that is left over from our personal expenses is carried over in each others personal savings and anything left over from the other expenses per month would get put into a joint savings.

One important thing to note is that twice a year we will end up getting a 3rd bi-weekly paycheck (subtracting $700 for the $25/day personal expenses).  This means that we would get $2,408-$700 = $1,708 roughly every 6 months.  The idea is that this is what we will use for vacations.  So around $3400 for vacations a year, not including any bonuses we get or other savings from not utilizing our monthly budget fully.

**Questions**

1) How much of a house can we afford?  

There is probably a 25% chance we relocate in 2 years to another city, if we do not make this relocation at this time, I think we will end up being here in Cincinnati for a while.  We are pretty set on a specific area and are expecting to pay around 2.1% in property taxes.  Based on my monthly budget above, it seems like we could afford $1600/month in mortgage/hoa/property tax/house costs.  

My credit score is ~760-770 and would be willing to put 20%+ down from my investment account to avoid PMI, if that ends up being ideal.

2) What adjustments should we make to our expected annual 401(k) and Roth/Traditional IRA contributions?

3) Am I missing anything here?",finance,1399658946

personalfinance,My Financial Adviser thinks this Whole Life Insurance policy is the rare good kind.,"I've just read all the FAQ stuff on Whole Life Insurance. It looks like /r/personalfinance is typically against it, very reasonably. But I think the plan that's in front of me is different.

I'm 25 and single. Is THIS the kind of thing you talk about when recommending Term over Whole? I know you guys can't make my decision for me, but all I see are scammy examples when discussing WLI, and I think this one breaks the mold.

* There are **no fees, and no commission** (directly out of my pocket), whatsoever.
* The **seller is unaffiliated, but not fee-based**. We've spent weeks working together on things they've seen no commission on, FWIW.
* The **insurance company is old and stable**; a lot can change in a lifetime, but the outlook is as good as it can be.
* They recommend TLI if all I want is a death benefit. They're serious about this as a type of investment.
* **They only want about 1/3rd of my ""savings"" dollars** to go toward this (or, **10% of my gross income**). It's just a safe, stable, predictable asset independent of the financial market. The rest of my money should go towards normal asset types.
* If I'm ever **unable to work due to disability, premiums are paid by the insurance company**. That's another form of security.
* If I want to withdraw everything and quit it, **I'll break even after 10 years**. Growth accelerates dramatically after that.
* **Money I take out does not affect the growth** (also: Non-Direct Dividend Recognition; money I take out does not affect dividends), and is untaxable. The downside is that **cash loans have a 4.4% interest rate**.

Based on the amount I put in every year, and the cash value at age 65, I'm seeing an annual growth of about 4.5%. 4.5% is nothing special, but for the security and stability that seems really nice.

personalfinance,Question about taking a student loan out early- bad idea?,"Bear with me- I'm 20years old, I have a great credit score, and  very good with my money. I've already paid back the private student loan I took out when I studied abroad, when took a semester off from college to work. This semester, I worked full time and did school full time. Now I've finally picked a major, and I'm ready to focus completely on school. I'll be going down to part time work in just a few weeks!

My school is inexpensive and I commute from my parents house , using their car. The only loans I have out are a few semesters worth of Unsubsidized federal loans, which only cover a portion of tuition- I cover the rest. It's really a blessing; I've been able to save up so much.

I'm planning on studying abroad again next summer (long story), so I would need another small loan, as I don't want to use all of my savings to fund it. I'll need about $5,000 from a private loan, but I doubt I will be able to get one without a full-time job or cosigner (not an option). 

So my thought is to take the loan out now, a year early, while I still have a job- I understand that I will have to pay the interest on it for that period and afterward, but I don't see any other downsides.

Bitcoin,"5/9/14 Video News: FEC's confusing guidelines, China censors Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Foundation election results","Video: http://moneyandtech.com/may9-news-update/

Today in Money &amp; Tech:

Yesterday, we reported that the Federal Election Commission issued guidelines allowing bitcoin political donations in response to a specific request from political action committee Make Your Laws. However, we've since learned that the parameters of this decision may extend beyond those laid out specifically for this individual use case. We're joined by Christopher David, founder and CEO of CoinVox, who shed more light on what this decision from the FEC actually means.

USA Today has temporarily changed the logo in the header of their website incorporating the Bitcoin symbol. Clicking on the Bitcoin logo leads to an article on the FEC's approval of bitcoin political campaign donations.

Voting on the Bitcoin Foundation’s two vacant board seats concluded last night with BTC China CEO Bobby Lee and bitcoin entrepreneur Brock Pierce winning by a small margin. Bobby Lee has been a strong voice for the bitcoin community in China, where his bitcoin exchange BTC China has been doing it's best to stand up against the China central bank’s ban on bitcoin-related bank accounts. Brock Pierce, another avid proponent of the bitcoin community, is involved in several bitcoin startups such as GoCoin, ExpressCoin, KnCMiner and Robocoin Asia, and is helping drive the proposal to revive bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.

The proposed plan to revive bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has received preliminary approval in an Illinois court, allowing it to be more formally vetted in Japan. The plan would involve settling the current class action lawsuits, and then granting those former exchange users a 16.5% equity stake in the new operation. However, the defense argues that this plan would also create new lawsuits from both the new and former Mt. Gox users, which could keep the accused parties in litigation for an undefined period of time.

 The IRS announced Wednesday that it will be contracting out to cybersecurity nonprofit National Cyber-Forensic Training Alliance starting June 1st. The contract will involve researching crimes utilizing digital currencies, and providing the federal government with real-time cyber threat intelligence. According to the IRS document, the Alliance will be expected to “identify significant cybercriminals engaged in financial crimes, as well as initiatives that highlight virtual currencies and virtual currency exchangers that service criminal clientele.”

The Winklevoss Twins have filed with the SEC to have their new Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, which would make it the first publicly-listed bitcoin exchange traded fund. According to the SEC filing, the Winklevoss ETF is expected to IPO for $1 million total shares worth a total of 200,000 bitcoins, so that each share is worth one-fifth of a bitcoin.

The China Digital Times has leaked a set of documents instructing Chinese media to censor their coverage of certain sensitive issues in China. This time, bitcoin made the list, which ended with instructions to refrain from participating in or reporting on The Global Bitcoin Summit 2014 kicking off tomorrow in Beijing. The instructions said ""All websites are asked not to participate in or report on the summit. Do not hype bitcoins. All reporting on bitcoins must henceforth accord with the specifications of financial regulatory agencies."" This comes as additional negative news for the Summit, after the recent announcement from 5 of the largest Chinese bitcoin exchanges that they will not be attending or participating in the event.

Meanwhile in China, a company called Hardbit has announced the release of a physical Bitcoin wallet. About the size of a credit card but thicker, the device touts many security features, as well as a camera to allow it to make in-person bitcoin transactions quickly. The wallet is now on sale in China, with plans to distribute internationally from May 10th onwards.",cryptocurrency,1399688040

I have fully discussed my feelings and my intent to separate with my husband.  So far, he seems extremely supportive and does not oppose separation.  As I expected, he wants to work things out and I am open to that as long as we both have our own respective personal space.  I made it clear that both us working out and us not being together are both equally likely, so there are no promises. It was important to me that he understand our relationship has a problem that needs to be solved and he gets that.

Financially, he has offered to help me get on my feet but I declined in order to protect that premise of independence. I want our decisions to be without influence since that has caused me a great deal of grief throughout this whole ordeal.  Even if we are to make things work, I want us both to be able to leave freely at any time without hard feelings.

I cannot show enough gratitude for all the help this subreddit and the fellows on the relationships subreddit have afforded me.  You have opened my eyes to the options I was too wounded to see. I know now with confidence that I can be happy and I can do this for myself as long as I am willing to work for it. All of this from perfect strangers. Thank you.



Income
------------

38k, salaried, no overtime.

New job in 2wks will pay 40k w/ overtime and salaried.


Loans
------------

Student, all tuition is covered by loans that are deferred until graduation (2-3yrs).

Our current mortgage is around 1.1k/mon.  Interest rate is fixed.

New house that we have not settled yet would be 2k/mon.  Also fixed IR.

Car loan is 480/mon.  4yrs left on loan at 0% interest.  Considering selling the car if moving to metro-accessible area.  Car has a value of about same as when bought according to Kelley Blue Book.

No CC debt.


Bills
------------

Car ins. 90/mon

Gas 60/mon

Pet ins. (new job actually has a benefit for this that may reduce) 40/mon.  I have one dog that I assume will come with me.  3 cats will stay with him.

Pet food 60/mon w/ cats, 30/mon w/o.

Again, assuming no cats but litter would be about 30/mon.

Groceries 150-200/mon. Cut our normal expenses in food in half to get this number and then added some just in case.

Netflix.. 10/mon.

I have an arrangement for my cellphone bill ($0) outside of this marriage so I don't need cable/internet if it is outside of my budget (seems to be right now).

The house we have now runs at about 300 on the worst month for energy, 80 at best.  Figure around 200 on average although he lived with me after I had an apartment alone in our home town and bills went up about 60%.

Water for that house is about 20/mon.


In summation:
------------

My estimated expenses seem to equal my monthly income, which leaves 0 dollars for anything but basic living. Assume no help from friends, family, inheritance, or divine intervention. Total independence. Clearly, this is unrealistic so I have sought help from redditors to find some creative solutions.  Perhaps a new living arrangement, ideas on where to live safely and cheaply in DC, or ways to reduce costs.  Also, car sale options.

I have decided settling on the new home is more than likely a mistake, so I will have to address this with my husband and will probably not continue into settlement.  I have posted in another subreddit concerning the personal details of my marriage in the event that it is relevant/interesting to the passing redditor.

Thank you in advance.  This divorce has led me to feel a great deal of anguish and I am struggling to find any and all options so that I will be prepared for the conversation my husband and I are about to have.

Edit:

I understand some redditors have their own feelings in regards to my personal situation but I would appreciate it if all of the comments could remain on the financial side of things.  I am looking for financial solutions to a very delicate financial problem. Anyone is free to post as they wish but I cannot promise you'll get the response you're looking for. I have not the luxury of time to debate my personal situation.  There is a lot more to it.  If you would like more details, feel free to see my account history and post in the more relevant thread I started yesterday.  Thanks.

Final edit:
------------

I have gotten so much useful feedback that is both informational and solution-based.  I did not expect as many replies as I got for fear of being written off as naive (maybe I shouldn't have included my age?) but I got a far better response than initially anticipated.  A big thanks to everyone who has replied.  I am far from resolved but this post has gone a long way in giving me the financial confidence I needed to take action.  If I could share internet hugs, I would, even with some of the grumpier posts :) 

If anyone reads this and has more to add, especially DC-specific suggestions, I gladly welcome it and will upvote/respond as soon as I am able.  I have a lot to figure out so I will be signing off at this time.

personalfinance,One more housing discussion,"Hi all,

I know this seems to be a topic that has been beaten to death lately, but I'd love to hear PF's take since my idea is to basically have renters paying my mortgage.  The quick and dirty:

* Income is 80k/yearly net
* Property taxes (state + county) are 2.4%
* Looking to put 40 (20%) down on a 200k 3b/2ba house
* Considering either a 5/1 ARM @ 2.5% w/ 2 points OR 15 year fixed at 2.87% w/ 2.5 points
* Estimating my closing costs when I buy at 6%
* Estimating my closing costs when I sell at 7%

My idea is this: I will likely be living in this city for four years.  I would like to buy a place and get two renters in who will essentially be paying my mortgage, leaving me with closing costs, repairs, and property taxes.  I'm thinking of this as an investment over four years at which point I will sell the house.  I'd like you fine folks from PF to tell me if I'm looking at this the right way:

* 4800 /yr taxes
* 3000 /yr closing costs (amortized over 4 years)
* 2000 /yr repairs

Assuming 2% annual appreciation, and 7% closing costs on the sale, it looks like this would work out well for me.  I would net ~38k at the sale, versus putting that 40k in an index fund (SPY appreciated average of 10% annually) and paying rent which would leave me with under 20k.  This is all obviously assuming I can get and keep two renters in there consistently for 4 years.  Is there any gaping flaw in my logic here or is this a decent plan?  Any thoughts on the ARM vs fixed rate?  The ARM seems better since I'm basically planning on leaving before I hit the variable interest rate anyway.",finance,1399733041
personalfinance,"Selling house, mortgage transfer for a new one?","My husband and I (24 and 28 respectively) currently live in a house that we desperately want to move out of for several reasons but the big one that PF will care about is how inefficient it is in terms of heat. We live in the NW and pay ~$300/mo for heating oil in the winter (in addition to the ~$2000 we spend every winter on firewood for our woodstove.) To compare, the house I'm about to talk about used $400 in heating oil all winter last year, and it's almost twice the sq ft of ours.


My husband is in the military and one of his coworkers/friends recently got a DUI so he is being discharged (ouch.) The guy had only moved here a few months prior and since the DUI he has been selling off his stuff in preparation to move back to his home state. The big thing he's trying to sell is his house which was brand new when he bought it. It's exactly what my husband and I wish our house was, plus the energy efficiency I mentioned above is incredible. The owner is a good friend of my husband and when they talked about how much we like the house, the friend mentioned a mortgage transfer. He originally bought the house for around $256k a few months ago. 


My question to PF is, how does a mortgage transfer differ from us just buying the house from him? He is a single soldier who likely did not have much of a down payment. My husband and I each bring home around $70k, (but we currently do not have a down payment saved.) His loan is assumable, but does a mortgage transfer mean we take over the terms of his loan? Both of us have very high credit scores and my concern is that we could get a better interest rate buying the house formally.",finance,1399733499

Bitcoin,If bitcoin goes mainstream will it continue to reflect our interests? We aren't a big group.,"The endgame of bitcoin is to go mainstream, maybe even global, some people would like to see it as the primary form of exchange worldwide. 

This raises a question I don't see get talked about a lot: the bitcoin protocol is consensus based. Bitcoin is open source and anyone can make any changes they want to it. With the limiting factor that the changes need to be transferred by the majority of the nodes, and the blocks they make need to be mined by most of the miners to have some effect. 

Right now that isn't an issue, everyone has somewhat similar views of what bitcoin should be. No charge backs, 21 million coins, decentralized. Core stuff. 

But there is only 750,000-3,000,000 bitcoiners worldwide right nows, with 8100 full nodes and maybe 10 mining pools that matter. A very small number. Not much of the population, not much of the global economy. 

When bitcoin grows there will be more people, more nodes, more money, bigger mining companies. More everything. But the more mainstream the protocol gets the less control the original users will have.

What will prevent the new majority from imposing whatever changes they want? No one here would ever think of raising the 21 million cap, But say a billion people use bitcoin, what will the 750,000-3,000,000 people that use bitcoin now be able to do to stop the other 997 million  from making a decision to use an inflationary currency, or implementing charge backs, or anything else. 

Basically, what will keep bitcoin ideologically pure once it's gone mainstream? The userbase right now is so small, it will be eventually so dwarfed by walmart shoppers once walmart takes bitcoin. The number of nodes run now is less than the number of students at a large highschool, the mining pools are tiny compared to what mining would be in a global economy. The current userbase will be a teeny teeny tiny spec compared to the mainstream adoption. What will keep the ideological alignment? Once it's out of our hands? And into the hands of people that don't really care about anarchy or decentralization or Austrian economics or the other current tenets of bitcoin? No one has ever released a version of the bitcoin protocol other than the 'core developers' but someday that will change, and what makes it so clear that the new majority will have the same aims and goals as the current majority?",cryptocurrency,1399736092

Bitcoin,My Full Theory / My Proposed Plot of The Social Network 2,"There seems to be some demand for my actual theory. Since it will take me a while to write, I will continue to update this post as I write it.

*It should be noted that the below is a* **theory** *and a* **work of fiction.** *This is not necessarily what I believe  happened, but rather what I think* **could have happened.** *No allegations are being made and no guilt is suggested or implied.*

First, I have been asked to post some additional evidence with testimonies which offer claims that deny the theory and that is only fair:

* 1) Two Bit Idiot (Ryan Selkis) has personally met Brock Pierce and [reports](http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/84919314429/brock-pierce-says-hollywood-reporter-claims-are-bogus) that Brock has denied the allegations entirely. It was unfair of me to not post this as an element included in the theory.

* 2) There have been some small irrelevant factual errors pointed out, so I would like to either correct or confirm some:

**Whether Brock and Autumn were dating:** It was never proven that they were dating, and they very well could have simply been good friends. The nature of their relationship is irrelevant, but the fact that it exists is what my point was: [Source](http://wagcenter.com/entrepreneur-wags/autumn-radtke-american-bitcoin-firm-ceo/)

**Screw the corrections. It's Fiction: Here is the movie's timeline as it plays out in my head**

* 1) Long before Bitcoin was being used for drugs and before Silk Road even was twinkle in Ross Ulbrich’s eye… Bitcoin was used to pay for child porn…. It was also used by geeks and computer guys since it was math based and fun to use... so not totally evil.
* 2) Before 2011, there were very few Bitcoin Exchanges, Mt. Gox was the biggest. It was also the only place you could buy Bitcoins for fiat before 2011.
* 3) In Februrary 2011, the following events all happen: MyBitCoin dissapears with everyone's coins, Bitinstant Launches, with the help of Mt. Gox, Bitcoin reaches parity with the US dollar. (Essentially making it a perfect way to represent $1 US dollar digitally.) Also, Mt. Gox only served US Customers in 2011... China didn't even have access to the Bitcoin Market until 2013.

**No conspiracy movie is complete without some sort of Government Involvement… so What if?**

* What if in 2013 when the government shut down Gox and seized their bank accounts was when law enforcement first entered Bitcoin

* What if Mark had a simple idea to have a currency exchange for all kinds of fun online virtual currencies for games?

* What if Bitcoin was infiltrated by the government? and What if they worked with people from other virtual currencies like Autumn and Mark to figure out how?

* What if everyone at the Bitcoin Foundation knew that “transaction malleability had been discovered and corrected in the code? Why would he even bother to use that as an excuse?

**Don't worry, now that I've asked those hypothetical questions and introduced Mark, act 2 begins right now...**

* In May 2013, Law Enforcement swoops in on Mt.Gox seizing it’s assets and Dwolla while they investigate them under FinCEN, all charges related to financial crimes and helping fund Silk Road (which they technically did).

* These “hidden” hashes usually show up as transaction info that cannot be decoded by the Bitcoin Protocol. In their investigation, they discover that the block chain has been used by “unsavory characters” to pay for, and transmit info through the Blockchain.

* In this world, they are able to send a Bitcoin transaction that includes 1 input and 3 outputs. 2 of the outputs are read by the Bitcoin network as an input, an output, and a change address… but the extra address cannot be decoded by the Bitcoin network. Why? Because it’s not meant to be...

**[Here's the article that is the inspiration for the next part of our story...](http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html)...** 

In case you don't want to read it, the main point is that it is very simple to include any file of any kind in the blockchain.... even [child porn](http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-child-porn-transaction-code/)**. 

* Luckily they were able to catch the above and remove it from the blockchain.

**Taking a break from our story, here's a few reports of non-Bitcoin information was purposely included in the Blockchain:** Here are some highlights:

* http://www.righto.com/2014/03/the-programming-error-that-cost-mt-gox.html
* The Wikileaks Cablegate Data: 
* Leaked firmware keys and illegal primes:

Between June and September 2011, there were thousands of tiny mystery transactions from a few addresses to hundreds of thousands of random addresses sorted in decreasing order. These transactions are for 1 to 45 Satoshis, and have never been redeemed. As far as I can tell, the data is totally random. But maybe there is a secret message in the addresses or in the amounts. In any case, somewone went to a lot of work to do this, so there must be some meaning. 

**Here's a few addresses wallets to look at:**

Well in this world, we have no way of knowing what's actually hidden in the hashes, but if I was involved in sending encrypted information on a public ledger, I'd sure as hell make sure know one can decode it but the sender.... child pornography runs rampant throughout this make believe world.

People who don't want to be found, are able to send value in US Dollars to anyone on the globe. No way to trace them. And no way to reverse the sale. Drug dealing, prostitution, and child pornography transmission runs rampant... the feds are completely baffled... they have no idea how to stop this... there is no way to shut down the Blockchain. And all these illegal and confidential files are imbedded in the blockchain forever.

**There is, however, one way to edit the blockchain on everyone's computers...**

In this world, if you control 51% of active nodes, you can control the blockchain. Enter our ""unknown"" villain...

**Wielding 51% of the network actually gives you absolute power over the blockchain:**

* You can basically add or delete any future or past transaction into the blockchain.
* Since you control 51% of the nodes, our fictional villlain is able to control enough of the network to produce an edited version of the Blockchain that will be the longest... and any new computers that join after this fork will download the longest of available blockchain versions... and with 51% of the power, your chains are always the longest. 

Now, realistically to control 51% of the network you would need to control a ton of mining power that someone financed:

* Since Bitcoin's value is climbing steadily, people are more than willing to prepay in advance for their own Equipment that literally makes money out of electricity.

* The company who they all prepaid money to for mining rigs announces a delay. 
* They secretly are producing the Asic cards in china for much less than the actual cost.
* After being able to build far more Asic cards than anyone else, they announced a shipping delay. You could either have your money back, or let them keep in a bit longer and they'll give you a better version that they are working on in a few months.

Have you ever noticed there are no ""fake"" ASIC cards on the market??? China is able to fake of counterfeit any product on the market, but there are no ""cheap"" ASIC cards.

* The components of an ASIC card are extremely inexpensive to be manufatured in China... and the only way they work is if the people distributing them are the ones who know how to program them.

* This manufacturer these with investors money and mine millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins by using the backdoor on the ASIC cards they sent them.

* Using this backdoor, they are able to overclock the processors remotely and solve a specific block... this results in a large percentage of blocks being solved by random IP addresses all over the world. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is that Sunlot owns a HUGE Mining Farm and now they want to buy GOX. The mining farm is made up of the miners that usere prepaid for to mine Bitcoin's until they are obsolete and shipped to the consumers. 

* Brock Pierce owns both KNCMiner and Sunlot and is trying to buy Mt.Gox... In this story he basically owns a mining farm and made a ton of money using other people's pre-orders.... Now he is trying to buy a Bitcoin Exchange to sell all those coins back to people.

**Writing Fiction is tiring. I'm gonna wrap up for tonight, but I'll continue my theory tomorrow. Let me know if you want to see the inspiration for any specific aspect of this story**

One more before bed:

* Of the last 12,000 blocks solved, 1 wallet has received 0.00000001 from 1,273 blocks. Or about 10% of all blocks since it's first transaction: **1BGbGFBhsXYq6kTyjSC9AHRe1dhe76tD6i**

* Each one was relayed by an IP Based or ""Unknown"" Address (aka: Not part of a known pool)

personalfinance,"Seeking advice for saving, retirement, etc (Expat)","Hello Reddit!

Here's my situation:

Canadian expat and I'm trying to find the best way to save for retirement and hopefully grow some money. I've declared non-residency in Canada for tax purposes which means that I am no longer eligible to open, or further contribute to, RRSPs of TFSAs. As well, buying mutual funds or other products in that line incurs a 25% cut that goes to the Canadian government same goes for any interest gained on money I have in the bank (according to Revenue Canada).

To my advantage, I'm working South Korea that has a tax agreement with Canada. Also, just finished paying off my student loans last month (hooray!). Single, no children, no massive expenses every month. 

On the downside, I'm really only starting to save for the first time ever since I've been aggressively paying off my student loans over the last few years. As well I have no employer contribution plan. 

Currently my money is sitting in a savings account in a Canadian bank. Interest rates aren't the best (I think about 1.5% right now) and it's better than nothing. I usually wire transfer money over every month to Canada, but will aim at doing it every few months from now on as my loans are paid off. 

**Here are my goals that I need advice and help with:**

* I'd like to start building up an emergency fund. How do I balance this with starting to save for retirement?
* What are some options to grow my money while living overseas? Remember I can't contribute to RRSPs, TFSAs or do much with buying mutual funds, etc
* What are some things I might want to look out for financially living overseas? I think I have most of it down but I would love to hear from you all in case I missed something. Penalties or benefits?
* Investment options suited for an expat? I've seen many different options but they're mostly for American citizens.

personalfinance,Who's better off: State Income Tax or Not?,"Today at the end of work a discussion came up that had some pretty deep dividing lines and I wanted to get /PF's opinion on it. 

The debate is who is better off: A person living in a state with no state income tax or someone living in a state with an state income tax? I'm under the impression that states with no income tax have higher sales taxes and the federal government let's you deduct your state taxes from your federal bill resulting in a net for the state income tax states. 

I understand the merits of not having an income tax and putting everything on property and sales taxes because it taxes everyone fairly, but for sanity's sake let's assume two people living in the two different states with similar income and similar spending habits (unless you think one or the other causes more or less spending).


EDIT: It looks likes the general consensus is the question is too complex for the simplicity I'm looking for. That a lot of it depends on the exact states and counties. And the benefit to higher taxes is worth it if you value the better quality stuff that comes with it (mainly schools). 

To break everything down, my coworkers and I were mostly discussing Ohio (income taxes) vs. Texas (no income taxes). I was arguing that because I have less net income as a population I'm going to be more responsible with my spending thinking and that with no state income tax my net income maybe higher to start with, but after I buy everything I need, I will have spent more (because of higher property and sales tax) and end up with the same or lower net income. Further because my net income started higher I think I have more disposable income than I actually do so I'm going to spend even more and go beyond my means. I was also wrongly thinking you could deduct your state taxes from your federal taxes and net the same amount of tax paid.

The counter argument was because your initial net income is higher your disposable income actually is higher and you can have a better chance to save.",finance,1399773249
politics,"What is the point of Medicare? (Not a link, hopefully a thread for political discussion)","If we already have social security, isn't Medicare just some bullshit the government takes out of our paychecks? 
The definition of Medicare (Or basically when I searched google) it said that Medicare is the federal health insurance program for individuals 65 and over, certain young people with disabilities, and people with some random ass kidney disease. 
I'm just asking this question because it seems like a scam but no one really complains about it. Obamacare is just now starting to cover it up to be honest, just because all the die hard right handed people on foxnews only complain about it. 
But in all actuality, Medicare is really the bigger hit to actual America IMHO.  It takes out money out of an individuals' paycheck for when that individual is old, and could pay for their own health insurance, and then the rest of that money goes to what our INCOME TAX is supposed to be going to; i.e welfare and for people who can't work (basically the same thing). 
Obviously if you've read my text, I'm on the right-side, libertarian to be exact. 
I don't mean to stir it all up too much because I hate the republican-democrat arguments because they all their pros and cons, but in all honesty medicare was just a complete left handed hay maker by the democrats just to make the privatization of social security that much harder to achieve. 

I'm very open to diversity so I'd love for some democrats to argue their case for why I'm a complete idiot because I'm open minded. If you can prove something I'm saying is wrong, please do so. 
I'm posting this to kind of test out my ability to lobby because it's something I'm really looking into, so this is sort of a lobby to the people of the internet/general American public. 

TL;DR I believe democrats (I.e Bill Clinton in the case), are pretty much demonstrating socialism by taxing the shit out of us and covering it up by calling it Medicare, which is nothing more than health insurance (Not like Canadian health insurance either).

personalfinance,Can I use early withdrawal to MAKE money with the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?,"I have an internship this summer where my employer will match 100% of 3% of my pay and an additional 50% of the next 2% (i.e. if I contribute 5%, they'll match 4%).

Say I put in $500 over the summer, and my employer matches $400. Then I withdraw the money at the end of the summer. This withdrawal is taxed as income, so I'll lose ~20% after federal/state taxes (at least until my tax return...). I would also incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty, and be barred from contributing to the TSP for 6 months. All in all, I would end up with .7*900 = $630 after taxes, if I'm correct. In contrast, I would have only made $350 without the TSP. The 6 month barring won't affect me since my internship only lasts the summer and I won't begin work again until the next summer.

So I'm 26 and I've had my current car for about 8 years. I don't owe anything on it and I really like it (Modified it to suit my taste) but it's started to become a liability and little age related issues annoy me. It's worth about $4k realistically and needs $3-4k spent on it to fix it. (A/C, oil leak, tyres etc etc) so I'm considering replacing it. 

I'm in a reasonable position financially: 
I owe about $300,000 on an investment property worth $500,000. I pay 5% interest on this loan but the rent I receive for it covers the interest payments. 
AU government forces a minimum of 9% into retirement savings so I have about 80-100k sitting there. No credit card bill. 
I recently moved back with my parents so have very little outgoings - I save about $3000/month living comfortably.

I'm considering drawing $55,000 out of my loan (I sit my money in an offset account against the original mortgage) and buying a nice car (AU - Cars are expensive). 
The good news is because I'm redrawing against a loan on an investment property any money paid in interest is tax deductable, so it means in effect I'll be paying a bit over 3% interest on this money.. which is not a significant amount of money in interest but I'll be buying a depreciating asset and I intend to move overseas in the next 12 months so I'll have to sell it bearing the brunt of first year depreciation.
Alternatively, I could redraw against the loan for the same 3.4% interest rate and invest in a safe bluechip stock paying high dividends. But I've been making relatively safe boring financial decisions my whole life and want to buy a nice car..",finance,1399808279
personalfinance,Car loan problems.,"Edit: I left a comment below with additional information. 

So last year my wife and I got a 2011 Chevrolet Equinox. I was in the Air Force at the time, and my wife was extremely adamant about getting this vehicle, no matter what. She was convinced her father would help us with it because I have a terrible credit rating (below 600) and I knew before even going in that it was a bad idea, and that we didn't need to do it - we already had a 2008 Impala that was treating us well. My poor credit rating stems from two credit cards I have and it is as low as it is now due to this car payment being so high.

We are paying $400 a month on this thing. I have something like a 13-14% interest rate on the loan. I am no longer in the Air Force (Honorable discharge at the end of my enlistment, nothing special) and this thing is eating us alive. We don't pay rent (luckily), but we need to figure something out here. I pay nearly a full quarter of my monthly pay on this thing. I am having to do everything I can do book more than 50 hours a week in order to make enough money to pay the car payment. Our electrical bill was out of hand this winter so I have not been able to afford to pay either of my two credit card payments. I skip back and forth between paying our Dish subscription on time (I would have cancelled it if it wasn't a contract thing) and paying our cell phone bill on time.

My auto payment history is impeccable. I have never missed a car payment on any car loan, ever. I did go into a 'bad credit' car dealership just to talk about lowering my payment somehow, either by trading the car down and eating the equity (we are upside down by about 5 grand) or by refinancing but I was told by the salesman that we would be better off selling the Equinox privately and taking out a small personal loan to cover the difference. The problem is that is our only car, so that is not an option. He then suggested we do a voluntary repossession (!) which automatically made me disregard any other advice he had after that point.

So here is my question... what can I do to get rid of this car that we never should have signed for in the first place and lower our payments? Am I stuck with this thing for a little while? Do I need to keep working through all of my lunches and every Saturday just to make it work? Meanwhile I am driving 120 miles a day to work back and forth and putting wear and tear and mileage on this pretty nice vehicle. I don't make very good money but we shouldn't be struggling as much as we are. Especially with no rent to worry about.",finance,1399816185
personalfinance,"At 25, I have no credit whatsoever, if what multiple credit report outlets have shown me is true. Where to start?","I apologize ahead of time if this type of post is an afront to any member of this sub.

But it's pretty straight-forward. I started going to a college a few years after high school, and I'm lucky enough to work for a company that offers tuition re-imbursement, in that I pay out of pocket at the start of a semester and the company reimburses me those costs after I pass the classes in that semester. I've never had to take up a student loan.

A few things have happened in that time financially. I had a debit account go way under but I paid what I owed with that. I pawned off a guitar and was unable to make the payments on it and lost the item. But outside of that, I've been pretty good financially and never missed any bills that have been in my name.

I'm pretty well off financially, in that I have no problem meeting obligations and still having money to stash away. After looking at numerous credit reports, I apparently don't exist in the credit world at all. If that really is the case, I figured I could use some of this disposable income to build up a solid credit score for the future.

tl;dr I'm financially stable and have no credit score. What are some inexpensive, lowest-interest-possible ways to build credit? Is it as simple as getting a credit card, putting passive charges on it and paying it off every month? Will having no score hurt my overall interest rates?",finance,1399817576

personalfinance,Advice on savings and best utilization of money,"Firstly I'd like to thank everyone for your help in advance with this matter.
Some information on my current situation.
I'm 20 years old, 21 in December and I work for the Navy as a Radioman on submarine X. My primary bank is USAA. I used to use Bank of America but I was getting so screwed through their fees and what not that I stopped with them so now I currently just use it to deposit any cash I might have into BOFA and transfer it to USAA.
My last months take home pay was roughly $1600.
I currently have $5,200 in my savings which I consider my emergency fund.
I have 1,092 in my Roth account. I have it auto deposit $150 every month.
On the same call that I used to set up the IRA account, they sold me their Universal Life Insurance. I told them I didn't need it as I currently have 400,000 in life insurance through the SGLI but they told me that this was for when I left the Navy. Getting it now would lock in this low rate which is $26.32. Cash Value $67.30 - Current Interest Rate is 4.500%. They told me a percentage of it goes into an account I can borrow against if needed which is the cash value above. My current contributions are $236.88. For $50,000 in coverage. I’m honestly not sure about this account, I think it’s redundant but I could use some advice on this as I think I got talked into it when I don’t thing I really need it.

I also have insurance through USAA at about $59 bucks every two weeks.
I have two credit cards, one that is for rewards that I barely use and has a $0 balance. The other one is for big emergency purchases if needed; it has a lower interest rate than the first one and also has $0 balance.
I leased a car back in April of 2013. A Hyundai Elantra, 15,000 miles for two years with $2,000 down I pay $197 a month. Residual value at the end of April next year will be right around $14,000. I pay $40 bucks a month for internet and another $40 for my phone.

Now I was lucky enough in high school and I received a pretty decent credit class. So I understand credit, and how it affects basically everything you do.
I'm pretty anal about it and I get all three credit reports and scores every month through Credit Check monitoring Premium from Experian. I've never missed any payments and my three scores are 741 from Experian, 728 from Equifax and 737 from Transunion. 

I've been with the same woman going on six years and I plan on probably proposing to this wonderful woman within the next three. So I will need money for the ring and I plan to propose in Paris(her parents took her there and she loved it/really wants to go back) so that will cost me a pretty penny to fly us both out there and the fees that go along with a trip like that.
I'm also going to need a loan within the next year to start paying for this car as I plan on buying it at the end of the lease.
I don't plan on staying in the Navy past my EAOS in 2017 if I can't get a shore duty near her when she starts law school.

So really what I'm trying to figure out is what I need to do with my money right now and still have it for when I need it. I dabbled in mutual funds from USAA, getting about $2,000 dollars into it with the combination of a low risk money saving fund, and a high risk aggressive fund. But I was told that the way the markets are going right now, were due for another crash and that I should take my money out so I subsequently sold and put it all into my savings. I don’t know how true it was but it came from a mutual friend’s financial advisor.
Should I start upping my IRA contributions to get my yearly maximum? Or should I put my money back in the market? Also should I use Vanguard instead of USAA? 
Any help is appreciated, thanks again!",finance,1399832267
personalfinance,"25M $37,000 in debt. Need some insight on how to go about paying this off.","Well I have 30k in student loan debt. It is broken into four different loans from fedloan (~6% IR). I know this can be better but I'm not sure the right path to go I order to eliminate this burden as fast as possible.

I have 6k in CC debt. I have transferred the balances over to 0% interest CCs (12-18mos 0% IR) this is the best I could think of about going about getting this knocked out.

Income-debt: make after taxes around 36k a year, rent $870 (lease is up in June) , phone/food/internet/etc. Expenses = about $400 a month.

I am currently at a point in my career that I am working on moving to a higher paying role. This may happen soon but I am trying to prepare for the worst.

How much would be a reasonable amout of money to be throwing at this debt? I also have NO savings (besides a 401k ~3k with a loan on it for about 900ish ATM.) 

Thank you for your time and a prior thank you for anyone who helps me with this burden.

I was led here via [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/25aimf/tx_ac_compressor_died_expensive_repair/) thread. 

Goal: Trade my car in and finance a decent used one. 

Credit score: Between 650-700

Income: ~$2300/mo after taxes.

Current expenses: ~$800/mo

Liquid: ~$2k

KBB Trade-In value of my vehicle: $1,645*

No delinquencies. 

I have never financed a car before but I've heard that I'd be able to get a good interest rate through USAA. I imagine I could comfortably afford a $350/mo car payment but I have no idea how to translate that into actual car cost once credit/interest/they see my raddy shoes is all factored in. 

Update: So, ~$10k max and reliable year/model. I'll have to resist the urge to get something faster. &gt;_&lt; The Saturn's 112 HP is depressing sometimes.

personalfinance,What's the smartest way to pay down these debts?,"Hello there /r/personalfinance !

I am gaining control over my finances, after years of horrible decisions, illness, part-time income &amp; bad luck. I could use some advice &amp; ideas. 

My main questions are: 

1. I feel panicked about living paycheck-to-paycheck. Would like to feel like I am getting ahead, but where should I start?

2. How can I pay off my credit card debt faster? I have zip-tied all my cards together and put them away so I am not using them. Do I call up my cc companies and ask for lower interest? Try to increase credit limit on the smaller-interest card &amp; move balances over? Try to open another card and ride on an introductory rate for a while? Debt counseling/consolidation? Bankruptcy? 

3. Should I consolidate my student loans? How do I do this? I'm not planning to go to school again. 

Here's a rundown of my current financial situation. I'm single, 35 y.o., in Colorado, USA. 

INCOME / SAVINGS / ASSETS

* Income: $3,000/month. Take home from this (after taxes &amp; health insurance) is $2,308.
* Savings: $40 in a savings account making 0.01% interest.
* EE Savings bonds: $2,570 total value ($970 is interest accrued)
* Junk car: my car's clutch broke &amp; I'm going to scrap it. Should get $300-500. 

EXPENSES

* Credit Card 1: $11,831 balance. $222 minimum payment. 10.24% interest. 
* Credit Card 2: $3,964 balance. $95 minimum payment. 18.1% interest.
* Credit Card 3: $2,583 balance. $73 minimum payment. 23% interest. 
* Student Loan servicer 1: $40,191 balance. $223 minimum payment. All loans under this servicer are 6.8% interest. 
* Student Loan servicer 2: $23,466 balance. $255 minimum payment. $14,263 of these loans are at 6.8% interest. $3,427 is at 5.6%. Remainder ($5776) is at 3.1% or lower. 
* Rent: $550/month
* Utilities: my share is ~$90/month. We have DSL internet, but no cable. 
* Psychologist: $220/month (hopefully will be seeing less of them soon)
* Cell phone: $99/month (contract is up this November)
* Renters insurance: $17/month

Since my car broke down three weeks ago, I've been taking public transportation (employer bought me a bus pass). I'm saving about $60/month that I was spending on gas. It has also saved me money in that I'm not shopping as much (no more Target runs). 

I try to pay a bit more on Credit Card 3, since that has the highest interest rate.

personalfinance,Internship tax question. File as Dependent or not?,"Basic facts:

21 y/o, college student

Home State: Pennsylvania

Internship State: Arizona

yearly wage: ~52k

Ok so I'm on this internship for around 7 months, ending this August. So that's around ~30k before taxes. I filled out the W-4 when I started in January and been having the ""FED withholding"" and state coming out of my paycheck so I end up seeing ~25% go to taxes. 


I'm completely oblivious as to what to do about filing taxes so I see the max amount of money returned. I was wondering what would be the better option. Being claimed as a dependent by my parents or not. I realize that being claimed as a dependent helps them with taxes but would that be a better option to see the most money returned and then I could split the difference with them? I would really really appreciate any guidance. I wish taxes were taught in school, because I feel completely lost and overwhelmed with all the different rules and regulations. 

Thank you in advance.


Edit:

So if I file as single (not dependent) I fall into the [highlighted bracket.](http://i.imgur.com/xdCeEjF.png)

-being taxed as the bracket lower for the 30k ≈ 5,300

-actual amount after 30k reported ≈ 4,000

And as a dependent that'd be $3,900 exemption on my parents. 


Follow up question: what would the tax rate be as a dependent? The same as single tax bracket?",finance,1399847103

To those who use the ""take a macroeconomics course"" response to defend FED policy, if you think the FED can maintain it's balance forever I'd like to have some of what you're smoking. To those who may not understand economics but understand what Bitcoin means, your interest in Bitcoin is justified. Do not buy what these ""shills"" or whatever you want to call them are selling.

personalfinance,"27 - Great job (~190k), good credit, lots of student loans (~120k), some reserves - best strategy?","Hey guys. So as I posted in the title, I just started a new job making around 200k (this is base + bonus + some equity that vests over time). I live in the Bay area (so that 190k gets bitten by taxes quite a bit, let's say around $9000 per month take home).

I've got about $40k sitting in a bank account from savings over the last few years to act as a rainy day fund. I pay $1,500 per month for an apartment (live with some great roommates, not in any rush to move out). I've got good credit as well.

The bad part is that I've got ~$120k in student loans. Most of it is private, luckily it was cosigned and it's at a variable rate. Given current Fed policies this means I'm paying 2.5%. 

How should I handle the loans vs. savings? I've got $9k take home, $1,500 goes to rent, assume $2,500 or so for expenses (lots of travel, etc...) minimum loan payments right now are around $1000 per month so I've got around $4,000 of flexible budget. How much of this should I be saving vs. just plowing into paying off loans? Should I go for a refi, especially if I'm thinking we're gonna get higher interest rates soon? 

From a psychological point of view, it would feel pretty awesome to pay these things off in 2 years (48k per year + 20k from savings basically gives me paid off loans). However it also seems like I can get 5-7% in the market with the cash, so maybe I should make minimum payments and put the rest into a portfolio?

I'd like to buy a house eventually, but I'm only 27 so I've got some time to wait.

personalfinance,"Grad student, student loans and some extra money. What to do?","As the title indicates, I am a grad student, but I'm actually paid decently and live comfortably. From my undergrad days I have a good amount of student debt outstanding- around 50k principal plus interest accrued since graduating not long ago. I have about 10k in the bank, just came into a 40k inheritance, make about 35k per year (less tax).

My options as I see them:

1. I could invest the money I just came into. I figure I'll leave 10k of it out, so I have 20k worth of low risk, liquid money should something happen to my income. I'll have to recheck the interest rates on my student loans, but it is possible I could invest the other 30k at a higher return rate than my loans are subject to. However, because of the 20k difference between what I'd be investing and my principal, this still may not make sense.

2. I could dump a big chunk into paying off my student loans. Maybe 30k, I keep 20k and leave about 20k to be paid off still.

3. I could do neither, keep my money in low risk investments and just pay off the accruing interest as it comes and wait until I have a real job after a long time to finally pay off the principal.

personalfinance,Interest free student loans vs Federal loans.,"Hello all.
I am way in over my head with student loan debt and am looking for guidance. I owe roughyly 62k total, of which 30k was borrowed interest free from a private foundation for low income students. I know normally you should pay down high interest debt first, but my repayment schedule makes me think I should pay the interest free loan first. The interest free loans must be payed back in 5 years with a 1 year grace period ending may 2015. If I wait till the end of my grace period, monthly payments work out to 500 per month for 5 years. 500$x12months=6000k per year for 5 years=30k. My monthly payments are proportional to my outstanding balance/ 60 payments.  My federal loans range from 5-8% and should work out to somewhere around $300 per month. My federal loans come due in November.  My current plan is to save 6k while paying my federal loans once they come due, then when the private loans come due pay 1000 per month for 1 year.

personalfinance,Leverage as high as possible for mortgage?,"Is there something wrong with my math, or does it really not make sense to put 20% down unless you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts?

**About me**

Just so you know where I'm coming from, I'm in my late 20's, graduated grad school a year or two ago, make a little over $100k/year and have $35k/year in expenses.  I max out my 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, and ~$6k in discounted company stock purchase eligibility for a total of ~$32k/year in retirement savings, leaving me with not too much left over after taxes/expenses.  I find myself wistfully looking at Zillow for houses for sale, but as of yet, I have saved close to $0 for a house downpayment because I can't justify pulling savings from other areas, the reasoning being below:

Let's assume you magically saved up 3.5% for the FHA loan, and assume you're trying to either save $1 in a 401k index fund or for a larger house downpayment.

**In the 401k**

This calculation is simple.  That $1 will appreciate at something like 5% a year (conservatively, no inflation) for the next 30 years, becoming about $4.32 by then, which, when withdrawn and taxed, will be more like 2/3*$4.32 = $2.88, a gain of $1.88.

**In the house downpayment fund**

This gets more complicated because of PMI and tax credits, and I will ignore transactional fees.  That $1 is taxed upfront, so you're saving $0.66 to start.  If $0.66 is the difference between the 3.5% down FHA loan and the 20% conventional loan, your total house price was $4.

Let's say PMI adds 1% to the mortgage rate over the life of the loan.  Using [this amortization schedule calculator](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/amortization-calculator.aspx), by putting down your 20%, your mortgage is $3.20 at an interest rate of 5% for a total payment of $6.18.  By going with FHA, your mortgage is $3.86 at an interest rate of 6% for a total payment of $8.33, an added interest of $2.15 over the 20% down scenario.  Right now, it's looking like a higher downpayment wins out.

Now to handle the interest deduction from the mortgage interest.  Without PMI, a $3.86 mortgage at 5% amounts to $7.46.  The *deductible* interest is $7.46-6.18 = $1.28.  This reduces your savings by the amount of taxes you didn't have to pay, so the total real savings becomes $8.33 - $6.18 - ($7.46-6.18)*1/3 = 1.72.  In other words, you were better off investing that $1 in your 401k by about 15% of your original dollar amount.

Without doing the numbers, it seems like once you're deciding whether to invest that $1 in taxable investments or not (multiply that $1.88 by 2/3), the downpayment fund is possibly better to within the error of my very simple model above.

**Edit** redid math according to traken's comment.  The new benefit over 30 years from investing $1 in the 401k over the downpayment is $0.15.  Took out the conclusion because the number of people who would benefit from 401k investing over saving for a downpayment became much smaller with the updated math.",finance,1399861625

economy,The best Economic Stimulus Ever: Get 6M mortgage debt serfs mortgage free in 12 months or less.,"Would it not be awesome to have your house paid for in 12 months or less?

Wouldn't you rather have that mortgage payment money to spend on something else?

Wouldn't it be better for the economy if say 6M of us were spending the mortgage payment on something else than mortgage?

Are you fed up with the status quo and desperately seeking change for the better?

Are you in favor of an immediate wealth tax which disproportionately hits the richest of the rich as opposed to the middle class?

Heres how we do it. 

But before I tell you, you must understand that it involves serious financial, political, and personal freedom risk. But read on even if you are not interested in any of that and you just want a good laugh before going off to slave again for the mortgage payment tomorrow. (And pay taxes to pols who feel entitled to have a dossier on you which would cause even the Stassi to blush)

1. Escrow your mortgage money in real physical gold. And take delivery of it. Store it in a safe place only you know. (Not in a bank safe deposit box)

2. Send a letter to your banker telling them what you have done, and that you are sick and tired of the banco fascist status quo. List your top three political grievances. Tell them the money is secured until you see some action on the matters you care about.

3. CC the letter to your congress critter, the minority whip, the speaker, your senators, and Valerie Jarrett (the real executive in charge) ABC, CBS, NBC, WSJ and the NYT.

4. Post it here and on your favorite distributed media outlet (blogs, facebook) Whatever and wherever you think you have social influence.

5. Watch the news and the political dialogue for any change. 

6. Ignore the hate mail from your bank.

7. Do the same shit again on month 2.

8. Do the same shit again on month 3. And so on while getting 6Million other people to follow your lead. This here is the uprising of the 700 Club - all FICO credit scores 700's and above. lol.

9. Begin watching for market signals; security markets falling (a defacto wealth tax), and the gold price going parabolic (great for those like you that hold it).

10. When the price of gold reaches say [$50K/oz] (http://fofoa.blogspot.com/search?q=%2450%2C000), deliver your gold to your banker, and ask for an unconditional release from your mortgage and all claims for delay default and any other bullshit he/she may have hanging over you. And the deed free and clear. Say, ""I got your mortgage payment right here bitch!"" And walk away a freeman or freewoman. No more debt slavery for you.

11. Go forth and spend money on dumb shit like its your patriotic duty.

12. Live a great life and die happy knowing you made a difference in your children's future by taming the central bank Leviathan.

Here's how it works:

In 2008 we discovered less than 6M deadbeat mortgage payers were able to bring the global financial system to its knees. Politicians began to listen. They took extraordinary action. Depending on your view, the mouths they listened to were wrong and the actions they took, imperious, anti-free market. And so they gave birth to Too-Big-to-Fail, a policy no less destructive to humans than Manifest Destiny (which labeled Native American as ""savages"" and gave just cause to annihilate millions). TBTF utilizes the lens of ""National Security"" to label persons as ""terrorists"" giving just cause to eliminate them.

In recent years we have seen the price of gold and silver swing wildly until these were tamed by naked shorts in the futures market. Thus, muting the inflation response typically associated with wonton money printing and sovereign debt monetization. The wealthy have benefited greatly from this policy of asset reflation at the expense of mom and pop savers and working class wage slaves. At one time silver expanded from $8 to $49 and Gold from around $700 to $1900 it seemed like nothing could stop them. 

And then the Fed released QE-For-Ever. Providing unlimited liquidity to the primary dealer banks with which to cover margins on naked shorts, bets that pay off when the price of gold goes down. This liquidity allocation was only possible after multiple prior QE events stabilized debt and stock markets.

Understand that in the event of instability, QE cannot be allocated to naked shorts on Gold and other PMs. It goes to .gov bailouts of TBTF's first, then stock and bond market supports next. In these events, wealthy investors want to know they will get paid their monthly, quarterly, or Biannual Dividend/coupon payment. For without these payments, their assets get repriced at pennies on the dollar. And so goes their wealth.

So the wealthy go seeking alternative assets like gold. And if the bank subsidiary that was holding it for safekeeping looks about to go belly up, then the wealthy will want to take delivery of the gold. Except they cant all have their gold at once, because there are more than 60 claims per oz in the futures markets. Everyone that believes they have gold in JP Morgan et al, is actually leasing gold out to many parties on an array of future delivery schedules. A real life game of musical chairs with too many people and too few chairs. Pitty the fool who has not possession of the real deal on the day the music stops. If you join the movement, that fool will not be you. :-)

In that event, you must be prepared to see gold go up a shocking amount, as the wealthiest among us place higher and higher bids for gold. They will stop at nothing to have it. $50,000k per oz is possible.

The event cannot occur without major economic instability. Instability which you helped foment via your support of the 700 Club uprising. What we want to do is show that we are capable of bringing the whole MF down if we don't get our way. Whatever that way is. I will let your combined voices be heard in your collective three grievances against the state. The most popular will surface to the top.

You must also be prepared to be labeled something akin to terrorist. For holding gold. For not meeting the obligations of your mortgage contract. They will threaten the hell out of you. They will trot out cases of human suffering brought upon by your actions. Your retired mothers and fathers will rail against you as you bring into question the solvency of the very security net they depend upon. You will be touching the political third rails of Soc Security, Medicare, indigent mothers and children.

But as far as I can tell the precedent for retribution against delinquent mortgage payers has already been set. Whereas it seems no mass incarceration of sub-prime borrowers who defaulted and never paid back what they owed. Hence, They will not arrest you. Not without the scrutiny of their prior policies condoning moral hazard. 

Besides, its not like you will never pay it back, you are just waiting till the market moves in your favor to then settle your debts. You are not sub-prime. You are FICO 700+. You are the backbone of why this country is great. Without you, nothing gets done. Nothing.  Everyother depedent MF is sucking off your teat.  And you deserve better. Don’t you?

And what could be bad about you and 6M other middle class folks living free and clear of their mortgages?

And what could be bad about you taming the bankco fascist leviathan for another generation or three. After all the Federal Reserve is the third central bank in our history. There is precedent for vanquishing it. Our founders and philosophers are filled with quotes telling us to beware of the man who controls the issue of money.

personalfinance,How to best use savings for freedom.,"29, single, no debts (except UK student loan), currently nomadic.

Income after tax: £1200 + any freelance work I get. (I just dropped down to 0.5 remote contract to focus on personal creative projects).

Savings: £150k invested half in ISA, half in crappy savings account.

------------------

In March, having read Tim Ferriss' FHWW, I negotiated a contract in my job to work 2.5 days a week remotely, which would earn me enough money to survive in most countries, while allowing me time to work on other more interesting/lucrative/fun projects.

For clarity: I'm contracted for 2.5 days a week, which I do! The rest if the time is spent on other things.

While it has been fun to travel and catch up with friends/family/visit some new places, I'm finding that without some kind of place to be between adventures, organising the nomadic lifestyle can be a bit of a drag. Also, while I'm having lots of fun, I'm not getting much more personal work done than I was when I was chained to a desk 9-6.

I'm happy living a simple life and value freedom/time over big money, though obviously want to save for old age etc. I'd like to have the freedom to travel as I need/want to.

So I'm wondering the best way to use my savings best give me a place to live and work that will still allow me to live as cheaply and simply as possible.

Options to me seem to be:

1. Use savings to buy a place to live outright.  To be close to London and most of my friends / work opportunities this would probably require all of my savings. Although would consider cheaper locations.  With all savings tied up, I could be stuffed if I suddenly lost my job for the first few years.

2. Buy a house with partial mortgage supplementing the payments from savings, but having reserves for emergencies, loss of job etc.

3. Rent somewhere. As this allows relative flexibility for travel and having a house sitting empty if I away for 6 months or more doesn't seem wise. Also, this makes me feel like I'
m not making the most of the money I've worked hard to save, though. Also my experience of renting has mostly been terrible!

It seems the trade off here is security vs. flexibility.

---------------------------------------------------

* Live frugally. Spend as little as possible. You owe a lot of money to something, act like it. If you don't grab it by the horns now, it could haunt you for years to come. 
* CREATE A BUDGET [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/) is great, or [Mint](http://www.mint.com).
* Stick to your budget!
* Allocate money to and IRA/Roth IRA/401k if possible. This will depend on your interest rates. Generally, if the interest is lower than 4% you could benefit more from putting money in an investment account. **Remember, putting money towards a 6% loan is a guaranteed 6% return**.

---------------------------------------------- 
Recent graduates should be aware of all their student loan repayment options. Most federal loans qualify for certain loan forgiveness programs, interest benefits, and flexible repayment options. All students with student loan debt should take all these options into account as part of their financial planning.

Use StudentLoans.Gov's Repayment estimator - ED just rolled out a feature that will take your actual loan balances and project your monthly costs for each repayment program, the total balance and interest paid over the lifetime, and potential forgiven loan balances. You can also now just log into Studentloans.gov and you can review all your federal student loan balances (and each loan's current status).

Any borrower that does not have a job at graduation should immediately enroll in Income-Based Repayment or Pay As You Earn. This provides more payment flexibility as you search for a job. Its better than a deferment or forbearance too. Even if you plan on making extra payments, the flexibility of PAYE and IBR can benefit most borrowers.

Income-Based Repayment - You pay 15% of your discretionary annual income divided into 12 monthly payments. If you have less ~$20k in income, your payments are generally $0/month. Interest still accrues but it is not capitalized.

Pay As You Earn - It has the same terms as Income-based Repayment except that you only pay 10% of your income. Also, this is only available to borrowers that did not have federal loans before Oct. 1, 2007 and who also had a NEW loan disbursed after Oct. 1, 2010 (confusing, I know).
Here are some other common questions as well:

Federal Loan Consolidation - For federal loans, the monetary benefits for consolidation are minimal; the interest rates are averaged and there basically is no discount. When the loans are consolidated, you cannot target the highest interest rates with extra payments. Only consolidate for peace of mind and a simplified process but, generally, consolidation is not worth it for borrowers.

Capitalization of Interest - When a borrower graduates, some loans have accrued interest that is unpaid. The interest is capitalized when you graduate (added to balance of the loan). ED and your loan servicer will send letter recommending your make payments on the Uncapitalized Interest before it is capitalized. If you do, then that portion of unpaid interest is never charged interest over the life of your loan and you save money. If you can, make payments on the uncapitalized interest during your grace period. It is a good way to save money if you have extra savings and a job.

Grace Period - Direct Loans have a 6 month grace period from graduation; then borrowers have to make payments. Perkins Loans have a 9 month grace period. You can make payments before that if you want.
Refinancing With Private Loans - There are number of companies out there that specialize in refinancing and consolidating private and federal loans. Each company is different but generally the lowest I have seen for refinancing is ~5% for borrowers with good credit. Keep in mind, however, that you lose access to loan forgiveness, IBR and PAYE if you refinance with private loans.

I am only mentioning these student loan issues because these decisions made right after graduation can have a huge positive or negative impact your personal finances for years to come.

personalfinance,"How can I lower my $1,100.00 a month payments on a $100k student loan debt.","I graduated this past November with about $100k in student loan debt. Fortunately I was able to accept a job a few weeks before I graduated making $75k with potential for more each year. 

My loans are private loans through Sallie Mae and the interest rates are high. It's broken into 3 different loans with 3 different interest rates (7%, 10%, 11%). So each month, I'm paying a total of $1,100.00 in payments.

What I'm wondering is, what can I do to consolidate these into 1 payment and hopefully pay a much lower percentage rate and monthly payment. I see some people on here are paying less than $600-700 a month in student loans, I would love that. Any help would be **GREATLY** appreciated.

personalfinance,401k Loan for part of home down payment?,"To resurrect an ever-popular topic here on r/PF, I would like to get your opinion on just how crazy I am.

My family of 4 has been living off of my salary alone for the last 7 years.  My wife just finished school, landed a great job, and we are direct depositing her entire salary to an online savings account.  Without touching it, we would have enough to make a 20% down payment on the house we want (just going by price range) in a little under 2 years.

So...we should do the smart thing and wait 2 years.  But, you guessd it - we are itching to move out of our overflowing starter home and buy the house we want to stay in at least until the kids are out of the home.  And we'd also like to do it before our youngest starts kindergarten in Fall 2015.

So we would consider making part of our down payment from a 401k loan, of which I have up to $30k available at the moment.


Here are some important details, taking into account my company's 401k loan policy:

* I would take a 5 year 401k loan for up to $30k (lower the longer we wait).  I am allowed up to 20 years but I'd rather pay this off faster since we can afford to.
* The loan would be at wsj prime (currently 3.25%)
* In case of layoff or termination, the loan is re-amortized for monthly payments until the same scheduled payoff date.  There is NO 60 day payoff requirement that I understand most companies have.
* My company's stock is currently at an all-time high (that's for over 30 years).  I know this isn't a good criteria since I can't predict the future trend, but my gut feeling is that time that this would be a safer time than some to take a portion of my retirement temporarily out of circulation.


My other options would be:

* A second mortgage.  Most likely the interest rate would be higher and the interest wouldn't go to my retirement.  But my retirement would stay in circulation...
* Borrowing from family.  Not preferred.  But maybe possible.
* Waiting until we can do it out of savings.  Before everyone just replies this, take our other factors into account.  I already know the safest option.

Thanks for your advice!",finance,1399910679

Bitcoin,"Two-Bit Idiot says the only thing Brock Pierce looks guilty of is having shady friends as a teenager, calls allegations ""last century"", declares him an ""upgrade""","On Friday, the industry members of the Bitcoin Foundation elected Bobby Lee and Brock Pierce to board of directors in the special election held to fill the seats vacated by Charlie Shrem and Mark Karpeles.  


So naturally, the torch and pitchfork crowd on r/bitcoin came out to play over the weekend with token condemnations of both guys and skepticism over the legitimacy of the Foundation itself.  The possibility that Pierce was tangentially involved in a sexual abuse scandal from fifteen years ago had the knuckle draggers shouting ""pedophile!"" in multiple threads, and the fact that China's central bank essentially banned Bitcoin and destroyed most of the momentum for Lee's BTC China led to accusations that he was guilty of price manipulation or lying to customers. 


There's something beautiful and ironic about (legitimate) elections, though: by definition, voters always elect the leaders they deserve.  So whether you like the new directors doesn't matter.  Most of the industry sponsors did and they voted with full knowledge of the positives and negatives of each candidate.  (Or at least in Pierce's case, they should have...given that the Hollywood Reporter article came out prior to the second round of voting, and I wrote up Pierce's response last week, something he elaborated on in this video.)  


Bobby Lee's addition is a clear net positive; he gets to do something productive in light of the fact that China won't seem to let him do anything at all.  With respect to Pierce's election, it's a mixed bag.  On the one hand, he obviously brings some (perhaps unfair) headline risk to the board, at a time when the Foundation can ill-afford image hits.  On the other, the only thing he looks guilty of is having shady friends as a teenager.  Otherwise, he's passionate about the industry and is involved in a wide range of successful and positive projects.  Both he and Lee are upgrades to the board in terms of professional experience, and the only way the outcome would have been better is if the fine Chairman had also resigned and paved the way for Gyft's Vinny Lingham.


As to the more important issue -- does the Foundation even matter? 

Yes.  And that's why the elections were so important.  


There are two and a half things the Foundation needs to do well in order to be successful--pay the core developers, foster Bitcoin education, and simply not make the community look bad.  They don't need to get involved with lobbying or PR or any other area where they claim to represent the broader Bitcoin community, mostly because history has shown that the organization will fail at managing the things it shouldn't try to manage in the first place. 


But how about the areas in which it should succeed?

With respect to paying the core devs, there has been almost no transparency to date regarding how funds flow within the Foundation.  All we can expect from the board is the token Form 990 (due this week) that all non-profit organizations must file with the IRS.  Pierce has promised to improve the financial and operational transparency of the organization.  If that transparency ultimately leads to less ""overhead"" and more funding for the devs that make this entire crypto-economy function, then great.  


With respect to fostering Bitcoin education, the regulatory affairs committee has done a good job communicating with state and federal groups on the basics of Bitcoin, and the education committee seems to have the infrastructure in place to seed more student projects that spawn thriving bitcoin ecosystems (read: MIT) and nurture the next generation of bitcoin entrepreneurs.  Bitcoin companies can spend marketing dollars on educating and converting older consumers and investors.  Let's see if Lee and Pierce help steer the focus of the Foundation away from lobbying and towards educating a younger general audience.  


The biggest role of the Foundation, though, is to simply exist without bringing negative attention to Bitcoin as a whole.  The board should consist of sharp, polished, high-integrity people who are willing to be radically transparent about themselves and the organization they serve.  With that in mind, Pierce is only a bad fit for the board to the extent some intrepid investigative tabloid whore chooses to reignite last century's DEN / Collins-Rector scandal with Pierce at an opportune time in the future.


But if the industry voters felt Pierce's strengths offset the pitfalls of this headline risk, then good, great, grand, wonderful!  Right?

I'm just surprised that other people are surprised this whole election is sparking backlash.  The only problem that I have with the outrage is that it seems poorly timed and misdirected.  Why inappropriately smear one of the few credible dudes that actually stepped up to run -- and let's face it, the pickings were slim -- without any real proof of wrongdoing, and why bitch about it only after the fact?  Instead, why not direct anger towards the industry voters who cast the ballots and hitched their wagons to the dysfunctional Foundation in the first place - thereby giving it de facto credibility that it probably shouldn't have? 


Either way, it doesn't matter who is upset, the vote isn't changing.  And the Foundation still lives and thrives with over 500 individual members and dozens of leading corporate sponsors. 

My two cents: at the end of the day, the Foundation's board of directors itself is just the scrawny coach's kid on an otherwise kick-ass varsity team.  Sure, Junior is going to get some playing time on occasion, but only because the starters (rocket ship ventures, investors, evangelists, and even the productive volunteers on the Foundation's committees) have already put the team ahead by 30.  We'll be cool with the fact that the kid is getting some minutes, provided he doesn't make us look bad by getting T'd up (Shrem), running out of the gym with the ball (Karpeles), or falling asleep in the middle of the court (current execs).  As long as he shoots at the right hoop, is a good sport and embraces his role, we'll keep him on the team.  Who knows?  With time, maybe he'll hit a growth spurt and actually surprise us with bigger contributions.  

Maybe that's just stupid optimism that the election yielded net positive results or was at worst a non-event.  Or maybe I'm just sick of talking about the Foundation.  Probably both.  Onward. 
 

*Before anyone shoots me a dumb ass note accusing me of waffling on Pierce after discussing last week the risks his election posed, do yourself a favor and go re-read what I wrote.  I commented on the Hollywood Reporter article at the time because I thought it would affect the election and lead to a drop in Pierce's support.   

And I was right.  Lingham lost by a single vote in the second ballot after finishing a distant third in the first round.  Last I checked, nine individuals and one company have terminated their memberships with the Foundation in protest of the election results.

We are a 30 year old unmarried couple currently living in California. We are going to see a financial adviser soon, but want to be armed with some more knowledge and ideas of what is possible or wise. Greatly appreciate any of your thoughts. 

Situation: Rent $1250, expenses ~$1500. Monthly savings deposit $2000. Hope to get married and buy our first house in the next ~2 years. 

Me - Earn 90k a year. 21k in savings (0.75% interest) 12k in 401k (no company match, but we are told it might start next year). I have some  stock options at my company that just went public. First 1/4 vests in September which might be worth something like 50k (very conservative guess, but again...options so its a crap shoot).  No debts of any kind. ~2 years away from US citizenship. 

Her - Earn 120k a year.  71k in savings (0.75% interest). 3k in 401k (with match, is currently putting in max contribution to catch up) currently has 52 RSUs (currently worth ~15k).  No debts. US citizen. 

We are thinking about moving to Colorado in the next year or so to settle down. We will likely be taking big pay cuts since we would be moving away from our respective industries and opportunities here. So our plan has always been to try and save as much money as possible while here. But we also want to have fun. We do spend a lot on travel at the moment. We want to get a few adventures in before kids arrive on the scene and all that.  

Anyway, we are not sure if we can be doing something smarter with our savings.We have been looking into some Vanguard mutual funds and such but we are a little nervous to put our house deposit into the stock market, especially since we would be using the money relatively soon for the house deposit. I know there are some CDs and other savings accounts or money market funds that can give a slightly better interest rate (not bloody much!) it hardly seems worth it.

As a 30-something with a job, I'm trying to decide whether to spend each dollar on paying off student loans or investing.  At lower interest rates, I'm probably better off getting the $2,500 above-the-line deduction and investing.

That said, I have a loan with $5,060.19 remaining on the loan, 197 months left, and paying $50 per month.  The loan is LISTED as a 7.65% APR.  I was trying to figure out the Effective Annual Rate is, but didn't know the compounding period.  If any of you know excel well, you know that you can use the value, payments, and payment periods to figure out the effective monthly rate which can then be converted.  To do so, I used this formula: =(RATE(197,-50,5060.19)+1)^12  -1

When I did this, I discovered that the effective rate is really 9.64%.  Before I call my servicer (myfedloan) with a dumb question, can anyone explain why this rate is so much higher than I think it should be?

personalfinance,Advice: Emergency Fund vs CC Debt,"29 years old. US. Screwed up financially in my early 20s, working on undoing that now. Gross per year is ~95k. Single, no kids, no property. Absolutely 0 risk of losing my job in the forseeable future.  

  
I started an emergency fund in February, realizing I didn't have one that wasn't part of my normal savings account. There's about $600 in it now; i have it auto-drafting a small amount every week from my checking account. My oldest credit card (11 years) is also my highest in terms of interest; 27%. The balance on it is about $750. I have other CC debts as well (totalling about $6k), but none with that high an interest rate.  
  
My question: Would it be better to continue building an emergency fund and paying this card over the minimum until its gone, or should I grab what's in the EF and pay it off entirely next month?",finance,1399935284
personalfinance,CC balance and opening new line of credit,"For some background, I was making around $25,000/year and now I just got a pretty decent raise to around $50-65K/year (Salary + commissions), 23 y.o. male.

I only have one credit card, and student loan debt that is still deferred (graduate in December).  Through poor money management I had racked up around $1,100 on my Discover IT card with a $1,500 limit.  I have been paying around $100 per month up until now.  My score was around 703 last month as reported by the FICO on Discover's site, and then I just checked and it was 673!  I just did a $500 payment and could probably pay a couple hundred more right now, but intend to have it paid off next month.  

Now,  this is my only line of credit that I have.  I pay rent cash, bought my truck on cash payments through a friend, and I pay my auto insurance 6 months at a time on my card.  I do believe this is my only line of credit.  

My question is, would paying off my balance in full have a rebound effect on my credit score?  What about getting another card to have more lines of credit?  I realize it would drop my score but would smart repayment help smooth out these volatile drops in my score?

My reason being is that once I pay off my debts I intend to make my first auto purchase in my name through a lender and want to ensure at least a somewhat good interest rate.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Trust me when I say I'm 25 and I need help with a CD about to mature.,"Information about myself, my lifestyle, my finances, and what I'm asking. 

25 year old Male who currently lives with my Grandmother and Cousin. I moved my cousin in for him to escape the crappy home life of his meth-addict mother and I got him a job, got him in school and he's currently hired at a prestigious communications company. I'm moving out with my long term girlfriend in a month or two to an extremely affordable apartment. 

All disposable income has gone into renovating my grandmother's house since it hasnt been updated in 20 years since my grandfather died. 

About Me:

I'm a musican and teacher for a living and I get by. Not weathly (what musician with a BM degree is) and here's the best part. I have absolutely NO debt. 

Car is mine and paid off, no student loans thanks to talent scholarshops, and I get plenty of work per week to get by comfortably, with an extremely small savings of about $4,000 in the bank which is growing slowly considering the home projects are slowing down. 

This brings me to my real question:

I have a CD which has been on a recurring 36mo. cycle for the past 23+years which matures in a couple days. 

Information about the CD Maturity.

Projected value: $11,975.03
Interest rate: 0.75%

Considering how I was raised I was overly taken care of by a grandmother who was afraid to let me do things on my own, I only started doing my own taxes in 2012, so that should give you an idea that I have NO clue what to do here. 

What would be the safest choice to do with this money which could yield a long term return years down the line?

Thank you so much for your time, help, etc. and I'm sorry for being ""that uninformed financial guy."" I just hope to be a good future husband and all that stuff.",finance,1399944216

gaming,High-School Water Wars Game Strategy,"My team is looking for input on game strategies, we are running out of ideas.

My highschool is playing a game with our senior class called Water Wars.  There are about 40 teams in all, and each team consists of 5 players.  Each week is a round, and the team with the most remaining players at the end of the round moves on to the next.  To get out your opponent, you simply must get them wet; most people use squirt guns.  In case of a tie at the end of a week, rock paper scissors or a coin-flip will decide the winner.

Of course, there are plenty of rules to complicate things:
-You cannot hit anyone on School grounds.  Follow all State, local, and federal laws and any rules of the land you are on
-Participants must be seniors at our high school
-Cannot hit players that are: inside a building(including garage) or car, at their place of employment(or on their way to it)
-You may not hit people when shooting from one of the protected areas listed above
-You cannot hit players while they are participating in a school event
-You may use an umbrella, and only an umbrella, as a shield
-Use common sense
-School Sponsored athletes may not be hit during games, practices, or in transit to or from away games


This week it is me and my four guyfriends against five girls.  The main trend of the game is to just park in your garage whenever possible and only leave in secrecy when necessary.  We have tried attacking the girls before school(the girls that don't have garage access), at their houses at random times, coming home from family events, at boyfriend's houses, etc.    

An attack was planned on one of the girls who parks outside but failed due to her mom coming out and blowing the mission.  After seeing me with my gun, the mom pulled her daughter's car right up to the edge of the garage so the girl could hop in; her car is now permanently parked at the edge of the garage opening, preventing an attack.  We are thinking about moving the car using a jack but these girls might make a case of us ""breaking the law,"" which really spoils the fun in my opinion, but that's how they want to play this.

We are also monitoring work schedules and practice schedules to hopefully get something out of that.

Any strategies, advice or comments are greatly appreciated!  Thanks Reddit!",technology,1399949777

personalfinance,What should a scholarship college student do to put himself in the best financial position?,"Hi y'all. Firstly, thanks for reading this and responding.

I am a 17 year old young man (about to turn 18), and I want to make a plan for improving my finances. To summarize my situation:

* I'm going to a top-level school in the U.S. (I'm also a U.S. citizen).
* I have two scholarships from private institutions that, combined with my school's financial aid package, covers all costs of attendance (tuition, room &amp; board, travel, books, and incidental costs).
* I have just over $2800 in a CD that matures next month.
* I have a little over $2100 in a checking account.
* I have invested in a stock that I put $1000 in and is currently worth about $500. It does not make interest or dividends. I've held this stock for about 3 years.
* I have invested in a mutual fund that was worth $6900 and is currently worth $6400. This fund gives a yearly dividend averaging about $1000 in December. I'm not reinvesting the dividends (they are the in CD). I've also held this investment for 3 years.

Now, I need to explain my scholarships. They will cover everything my school puts on the bill, and I will likely be provided a stipend from each. I don't have confirmation of it yet, but I know for certain that a stipend from one scholarship can reach $6250 per year. The other will give me $1000 that will be distributed in $200 allotments my first three years, and then $200 each semester of the 4th year assuming I graduate in 4 years (I plan to do so). Unless there are major changes to my school's financial aid package, all of it is in grant form, and my family will not be forced to pay anything as long as my scholarships cover my costs. In the event of that my school does require my family to pay (under an Expected Family Contribution), one of my scholarships will allow me to take out a loan that they will pay in full, including interest, upon my graduation, as long as I maintain good grades. I am not using the full value of my scholarships, but they will only cover what my school doesn't give me in grants.

My scholarships require I maintain a 3.0 GPA, good standing, etc. - all things I know I can do. An important note is that one of my scholarships strongly recommends that I **not** work during college because they are already giving me the larger stipend and have more stringent requirements (mainly academic). This scholarship will also give me stipends for studying abroad and summer internships. If I do work, they want me to limit it to no more than 15 hours per week Additionally, my school will not grant me work-study status due to my scholarships. This means that I can't take the jobs specifically reserved for work study students, but there are opportunities for normal work. 

My plan is to focus on my academic work. I don't want to work during school, at least not at first, because my school is very difficult. My scholarships intend to give me the freedom to focus on schoolwork without financial stress. Because of the stipends I receive, I believe it is much more important that I maintain good grades. I intend to pursue a PhD, and my field of study (humanities) should allow me to receive fellowships for my further study, but I need to build up a strong academic career. I plan to spend my summers interning/researching/studying abroad. I will live on campus all four years, so those costs will remain covered.

So, onto planning. I believe that I need to get my money out of the stock currently worth $500. I don't foresee its value increasing in the near future. Any suggestions with this?

I'm not sure if I should stick with the mutual fund: the dividends are good, but the value fluctuates a lot, around 20% in the course of the past couple of years, and the value has not reached the price at which I bought it. If I do stick with it, should I reinvest my dividends?

Next, I have the CD coming due, and I don't plan to allow it to roll over since the interest rates are so low right now. I also have a fair amount in my checking account. I think I should set aside about $2000 for an emergency fund (my home is far away from school so things like travel get expensive). 

Finally, I'd like to get some kind of long term investing/retirement fund set up. Because I'm not planning to work, I won't be able to do a 401(k), but I think I can set up an IRA, and a Roth IRA seems to be the better choice. I can sock away at least a few hundred dollars in there every year. In terms of long term investments or diversifying my portfolio, I have no idea. 

Thanks for your help!

Bitcoin,Something that would encourage wider adoption of Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer lending system.,"This is an idea I had recently when wondering what to do with my Bitcoins just hanging out in my wallet, stubbornly not earning me any interest. Until banks accept Bitcoin, money held in a wallet is not earning value.

Then I rembered an old website called Prosper.com. This site had some customer service issues, but their business model was brilliant: they functioned like a mix between kick starter and eBay for loans. People wanting to borrow money would fill out an application with their reasons for wanting the loan, their credit report was pulled, and then investors could bid on a dollar amount to loan and an interest rate minimum they would accept. Lenders and borrowers could ask questions prior to any bids.

After a bidding period, the borrower got a loan offer of their requested amount (if fully funded) at the lowest rate lenders accepted, and the borrower could choose to accept or reject the loan.

This site had all kinds of people- those with stellar credit could get amazing rates when compared to banks, and people with horrible credit could get a second chance. It was a wonderful set up. 

I invested money in it, looking for high rates of return by seeking out people who were trying to get out of debt but couldn't get a consolidation loan through traditional means. I personally helped 14 people out that way, and earned a nice 13% interest rate, even after one guy defaulted.

I also benefitted by getting a loan myself to pay off a credit card that was at a much better rate than any of the balance transfer cards available to me at the time.

It was a beautiful system that innovated against the traditional banking system in a free market, competitive manner.

Enter the SEC. They decided Prosper was an unlicensed securities exchange and shut them down. When the website reopened over a year later, they were a mere shadow of their prior potential. Other peer to peer lending groups are out there, but all follow the same, limited business models out of the threat of the SEC.

With Bitcoin, however, a truly innovative peer to peer lending system is possible. Because Bitcoin isn't recognized as ""real"" money by the powers that be, they would have no interest in it. Even if they did, they would have no power over it: Bitcoin is border less.

Thanks in advance for reading.

Text:

Income taxes are complicated things.  There are literally thousands of pages of laws, and hundreds of different forms that some people have to use to file their income tax return.  However, the basic system isn’t really that complicated.

Before I explain the income tax system, let me explain something very similar:  budget billing for utilities.  If you sign up for budget billing, your total bill for the year is estimated, and divided up amongst twelve months.  You make that estimated payment each month, regardless of the amount of your actual utility bill.  At the end of the year, the company calculates the amount of all your payments, and the amount of all your bills, and compares them.  If you’ve paid too much, you’ll get a refund of the overpayment.  If you haven’t paid enough, you have to make up the difference.  For example:

(sorry, I don't know how to include images)

The utility company has done a good job of estimating Terry’s and Shawn’s electric usage for the year, but they’re off by a little bit in each case.  That’s to be expected; the utility company has no idea that Terry has decided to be very careful about his usage, or that Shawn is buying a huge new TV that uses a lot of electricity.

Each month, Terry and Shawn pay an estimated bill, and their accounts are tallied up at the end of the year.  Terry has overpaid, so he is receiving a refund.  Shawn has underpaid, so he has an additional amount due.

Does that make sense so far?  Good, because income taxes are calculated pretty much the same way.

Income taxes are calculated on a yearly basis, but no one knows how much you’ll owe at the end of the year.  Therefore, your employer has to estimate your yearly income and any deductions and credits you might receive.  The employer uses the information you’ve provided on your W-4 Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate.  Each time you are paid, the employer calculates your estimated yearly tax bill and divides that amount by the number of pay periods in your year.  Your withhold that amount of money from your pay as for federal income taxes, and forward that money to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be applied to your total tax bill at the end of the year.

At the end of the year, you (or your tax preparer) add all your income from the year, subtract any adjustments to income, deductions and exemptions, and gets your taxable income.  You calculate how much tax is owed on that taxable income.  Then, you subtract any credits (such as the child tax credit), and add any additional taxes owed (such as self-employment tax), to get your total tax.  Then, you subtract the amounts you’ve had withheld from your pay throughout the year, and apply any refundable credits (like the earned income credit.)  The total will be how much you have overpaid, or how much more you owe for the year.

It looks like this:

(sample simple calculations)

Just like with the electricity bill, you’re having estimated taxes taken out over the course of the year, in the form of withholding. This is the amount on your paycheck that says Federal Income Taxes. It’s not actually a tax payment, it is an estimated payment towards your total year’s bill.

At the end of the year, you calculate your taxes due and compare them to the total withholding that has been taken from your pay over the course of the year. If you’ve overpaid, you get a refund. If you’ve underpaid, you owe additional tax.",finance,1399980375

I have no understanding of how money works outside of there being money in my savings account, but over the past almost 4 years I have gone from having zero dollars in my savings account to a little over $32k. I feel like that's a good amount and that I'm doing a good job saving but I'm not confident in that assumption.

Money makes me nervous. And putting my money in the stock market seems terrifying when it's taken me four years to save it all, I don't like the idea of writing a 20k check to buy stock in something I don't understand, and as far as I can tell, royally f-ed my parents over.

I think I do a good job saving, but can someone point me in a more mature direction of...doing stuff with money? My dad seems to think you can ""make your money work for you."" So. What's a straight forward, (relatively) low-risk way of moving in the right direction? My current inclination is to write a 20k check to a broker for a mutual fund something and just call it a day. Good idea? Bad idea?

edit: oh, I've also been told, that likely my future job will pay me enough that saving 32K will not take four years. So my resistance to losing my savings in a slightly more risky investment is more emotional than practical. Apparently now is the time to risk? That seems terrifying. Thoughts? (p.s. I'm 25 if that helps decide how risky I should be with dollas)",finance,1400010469
personalfinance,Does this refi make sense?,"Got a call from my original mortgage finance company and was told I could refi with only 10% equity (they buy the mortgage insurance) but my interest rate would be higher. Right now I am at 4.25% and was told my new rate under the refi would be 4.8-5%. I have FHA so I would drop the MI but my mortgage payment would go up by $100 or so. In the end the net benefit to me would be a total mortgage payment (included taxes, insurance, etc) of $200 less a month. I bought the house 7 months ago and only put 5% down. 

Is this too good to be true? I'd like to get a refi sooner to avoid rate hikes, but I figured 7 months in was too soon. I live in a decent market where home values are rising, but idk if they are rising that much.

Loan is FHA after June 2013. So I am stuck with MI for life of the loan.

personalfinance,"About to get married, family pressuring us to buy a home. Give me ammo to tell them why not?","SO &amp; I are getting married in August. We work in media/arts, and while income is steady and growing, we don't earn as much as you STEM, medical and financial professionals. In addition, we're young, and in a lot of student loan debt.

Regardless, both our parents and some of our friends are often hinting/suggesting that we should buy a home right after we get married. It seems like nothing I say gets through to them that we're not ready/it's not worthwhile for us at this time.

Here's what I say:

* We don't know where we're going to be in two years. Jobs will likely change, we might even live in a different part of the country. We wouldn't earn enough equity in that time to earn much (if anything) off a home purchase.

* Lots of student loan debt. We went to out-of-state/private colleges and got BAs in creative fields. We're making payments and chipping away at the debt, but 2 years after graduation the mountain is still pretty high.

* High debt-to-income ratio. Fair/good credit scores. Probably not going to get a good interest rate on a mortgage.

Here's what they say.

* You can still get a loan even if you don't have much to put down.
* You're wasting money on rent.
* The market will get too expensive if you wait much longer.

What can I say to get them off our backs? Are they actually right? Links to good articles would be helpful. I showed my dad the NYTimes ""should you rent or own"" calculator and he wasn't convinced since it's not area-specific.",finance,1400016319

personalfinance,House Swap with parents?,"**My status:**

* 27, working full time, living with family for the past 4 years (Northern Virginia).

* Take home - $8500 a month before taxes (expenses of &lt;1200 car + misc... max out 401k + IRA blah blah)

* Accumulated 90k for house down payment.

* Looking to buy a town house ~ 500k (in Fall 2014) to move out / in with GF.


**Parent’s Situation–** 

* Both around 50 – Planning to work for another 8 to 10 years

* They gross ~ 200k yearly (only last 3 years) + (~600k in retirement savings)

* Town house Valued @ ~ 500K 

* Loan of ~400k @ 3.67 % for 30 years (Refinanced in 2013)

* ~ 2500 monthly payment + utilities / insurance / maintenance

We are living in the house since 2005. They have always wanted a bigger house. Call it peer pressure, American dream or whatever it is… Now that I have started looking for a house, they wanted/suggested to buy a bigger single family house further away (30 mins drive) on my name (in which they live after I move out next year) and “give” me the current house we are living in. I put quotes because the new house will be on my name, and the current house will be on their name. 


Parents and I have a good relationship. They have worked hard to provide me the life I have today and have been very forward thinking about my future. They allowed me to live with them past graduation / fulltime working so I can save up…. So there is mutual trust.

The arrangement is that they will use my name for the new mortgage, but will take care of the monthly payments. I will be taking care of the townhouse payment. 

* New house down payment (20% of 650k) = my 90K + parents 50k 

* Parents new monthly payment = ~ 3000 per month (520k loan for 30 years @ 4.25%)

* My monthly payment = ~2500

The question is not about the affordability (I can easily make $2500 payment), but the things I have to consider in a situation like this.

Sure If I scrap this idea, and just buy a town house we will have same 2 town houses – and they can save 50k towards retirement. They have some savings, but could definitely use a boost. (~600k). But what’s the point of saving retiring when they can’t enjoy life a little? They will be working / saving for the next 12 years… (Fingers crossed)

Sure, I will be giving up the excitement of searching for a new house. Well - I will be searching for a house that I won’t be living in… and several other 'first' experiences with my GF. I should add that my GF is against the idea of the house swap. (That’s a whole another story of convincing her…). 

I don’t have a clear objective on what I am trying to get out of this post. May be a justification. May be something else...

**What are the things I should consider?**

**Interest rates** – if I buy a house now independently and parents decide to buy a bigger house later (after selling their townhouse), the interest rates for both mine and their will be higher. If I keep the townhouse they 

**Title Transfer** – since the title is on different persons than who is living in the house (assuming no one will be screwing each other) what other things should I worry about?

**Mortgage payment** – what if they cannot keep up? I will on hook for both payments. (Well… I feel responsible)

Since I turned 17 I was either going to school, or playing poker for a living. That entire time I’ve lived with no expenses. I kept a small bankroll for poker, but spent most of my winnings on unimportant stuff.

When I got my job three months ago I had about 2k spare cash laying around the house. I banked it into savings, and since then have deposited exactly 1k(out of 1.4k checks) into savings per month from work. The rest of my check into checking for spending cash. So at the moment I have 5k in savings.

I have no bills, no expenses, and will continue not to for the foreseeable future, if I need to explain why, you can ask and I will, but trying to keep this short for now. I just agreed to keep this job for 2 years. At the rate that I’m saving money I expect to have about 25k in savings at the end of those two years. I may or may not need access to some (~10k) at the end of the two years. 

I grew up half of my life so poor I could barely stay clothed and fed, and the other half of my life so rich that a new Porsche every 4 months was commonplace.

** RRSP were at 30K before I paid the condo downpayment, I used the HBP program to get the max amount (25K) for the condo downpayment so I'll need to reimburse at least 1666$ per year in my RRSP.

Current debt

- I have 6k in debt on a line of credit at 6% interest, credit card is paid off each month. I'm putting 200$ to 600$ per month on my line of credit depending on what's left but sometimes my expenses are too great (car repairs, broken appliances/stuff, etc). I'm trying to pay that debt as fast as I can (i'm a bit impatient too) but I find it really difficult to cut my spendings. Food, beer and entertainment are probably the easy targets..

Target

- My ultimate target is 0 debt (except my mortgage of course) _before_ moving in my condo. Time is running out and I'm easily stressed over money.

Am I realistic with the numbers? Condo/home owners, did I miss any important things? My salary will most likely increase soon as I'm about to take a higher position but can I live well with 3-400$ left per month (assuming I have no other debt)?

dogecoin,An example of a coin switching to Proof of Stake,"Continuing from this post http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/22w9gk/why_i_think_proof_of_stake_is_the_answer_for/

I believe that once Dogecoin reach block 600,000 and fixed 10,000 coins per block reward, we should switch to Proof of Stake.

No need worry about 51%. Grenner.  No need for mining rigs doing mindless hashing. A PoS of 5% interest rate which will equal the same 10,000 block reward.

I'm keeping a close eye on Panadacoin (PND) that have decided to switch from 100% PoW to 100% PoS.  There are 8 days left to mine PND.  The coin has experience an increase in price since the announcement.  It's interesting to see how switching to PoS will benefit the coin.

personalfinance,Traveling the world for at least a year starting in June. I'm wondering if I should diversify more before I go.,"I'm 28/m and I recently quit my job and sold my home so that I could travel around the world for at least a year starting in June.  I eventually want to learn some new skills as well and find a way of making money outside of 9-5 cubicle work, ideally becoming a digital nomad, but that's not necessarily my question for today.

I'm hoping you guys could let me know if I should leave my setup as is or invest in more while I'm away.

I have 55k saved up, with 20k of that going toward my year abroad.  I also maxed out my Roth IRA contribution for this year while I still had an income, and put that money into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. After my travel insurance and setting aside money for the remaining expenses I'll have while I'm gone (student loans), I will have 25k as any 'start-up / emergency' cash if needed aside from my trip. I currently have 18k in student loans @ a 2.1% interest rate. I'm not terribly concerned about the small monthly payment. With the home sale, I did pay off a $5,600 chunk at a higher interest rate 2 weeks ago, so I was at 23k. I have no other debt, just the student loans.

I'm confident that I will find some new way to earn cash, even if it's teaching english or freelance writing, and I'm also confident that I would really only need a 20k safety net if I needed to come back and find work in the states again.

Would it be a good idea to take 5K of that remaining 25k and invest it in some index funds in a non-retirement account just for the sake of investing and keeping up with the market? How would the taxes work if, let's say, I don't have an income come tax time yet? Would you have any other suggestions?

personalfinance,"Baby coming in Sept, wife wants to reduce her hours, can we swing it?","I’m 25 with an MBA and CS degree, my wife is 23 with no college, and a retail management job.
I gross $67500 a year, with $3375-$6750 in bonus every January. I’m salaried, on 26 pay periods, $1999.26 / paycheck every other week. My wife currently makes around 750 / paycheck, every other week 


http://i.imgur.com/UDLOEr3.png


We purchased our first house last November, and we sunk around $13,000 in cash between the down payment and renovations. Our original plan was to pay down my student loans, and all of the credit card debt before we thought about having kids, but then life happens, and now we’re expecting a little girl in September. My wife is very keen to drop down to part time in June until the baby is born, do 12 weeks of FMLA, and then continue part time at her job. The biggest issue with her going part time is that she’ll lose her health insurance (I’ve been told my insurance will not have an issue picking her up, and paying for all of the maternity stuff, but I’m waiting to get it all in writing before I count on it), and her pay rate goes from $14 an hour to $9, which on top of working half the hours, she’s getting a lot less per hour which really increases the hit. Adding her to my insurance makes my per paycheck contribution go from $22 up to $175. Reducing her hours will probably drop her check to around $275 every other week.


So far, I have a plan to increase our net monthly cashflow around $1500, if everything goes well. I've adjusted my W4s for state and federal to take early advantage of the child tax credit (increased net/check around $280), I moved our Phones to republic wireless (Saved $100 a month), we’re overpaying escrow on taxes and insurance by about $150/month; I’ve been told we might be able to get that adjusted, I can change my federal student loans to the graduated plan and that will save $300 a month, paying off some small credit card balances will save $240 a month, I did a balance transfer from an Amex to a chase Slate which gave us another 15 months no interest to finish paying off wedding expenses from last year and the extension saves us $250 a month. 


I’m really trying to wrap my head around whether or not we can afford for her to drop part time before the baby is born. It will cost us around $1900 in potential earnings, and another $1200 or so in increased insurance costs, all of which could go towards our savings if she doesn’t cut her hours. On the other hand, work is really stressing her out all the time, and I think her employer is trying to get her to quit (Cutting her staff, and generally being terrible to her right now)


My wife isn’t very engaged in our finances, but we’re both generally thrifty, and aren’t big spenders (we sometimes eat out a bit too much) so tightening our belts hasn’t been too hard. My general financial philosophy has been to protect cash reserves at all costs, which is why we carry so much revolving credit, though I regret it now as it ties up a significant portion of our cashflow, and means that life events aren’t being kind to our budget. I’m really worried how much more our expenses will balloon when my daughter is born so I would like to have a lot more cash in the bank than we do. I’m budgeting for a one time medical expense of around $3500 when the baby is born, so I’ve been socking away $500 a month into savings to plan for that. I feel like there’s a lot of uncertainty right now, and I am really struggling with the decision. Are there child related expenses I’m not thinking about? So far we’ve spent about $200, and have most of the clothing, toys, etc for the first year. My parents are buying us a crib, and we’ve already got a great glider, so I can’t think of any other large expenses pending. Do my numbers seem sound? There’s so much to think about, I don’t know if the fact that I’m going to be a father has even really sunk in, I’ve been so wrapped up going into cashflow analysis mode. Wife is mad that I'm spending so much time sweating over the finances.",finance,1400044898

1) As with all proper sites - we use 2FA and preserve anonymity but we'd like users to register with an email when signing up. How much of a barrier is this for you guys? 

2) We have no min deposit or withdrawal but are thinking of incentivizing people to keep small sums on deposit by offering an interest rate. Would this work for you? 

3) Unlike many other sites we don't ask you to play against the house. Rather all users roll against each other and the pots grow collectively larger as more people play. We run a bot (also provably fair of course) when there are not enough players in each round. Are you guys comfortable with this?

4) We're API based and would love to see several bots coming in. We'll even give out sample code to people who express interest in it. How valuable is this?

However I do have some outstanding credit card debt that I need to get rid of to free up some cash in preparation for an upcoming onslaught of monthly student loan payments.

Unfortunately however, my credit score has taken a hit from my crappy utilization ratio. Im sitting somewhere around 650.

personalfinance,Checking on my plan and a few questions,"**Background**

I am a 25 year old, male, college graduate living in a North-Eastern US city.  I am living with my girlfriend, and we split rent, utilities, groceries, and other miscellaneous expenses.  Outside of that, we do not delve into each other's finances too deeply.

I went to a fairly expensive university, but thanks to scholarships, grants, and working through school I only had to take out ~$35k in federal loans while getting a BSBA degree.  I had been paying off the loans in lump sums in age-order since they were all at the same interest rate (6.8%), but now that I am down to the final 3 larger loans, I am looking at using the avalanche method to finish them off.  These loans just came into repayment recently, so I have been paying above the minimum amount each month for the past few months.

I am currently working at a university, so although my salary is not as high as other people with my degree, I do have some other benefits.  I am working towards my Master's degree using the university's tuition remission program, but when I exceed the ~$5500/year limit on credits, I do have money withheld from my paycheck for taxes.  In any case, it is still far cheaper than paying for graduate school on my own, and I do receive some of the money back when I file taxes.

I turned 25 earlier this month, so I now qualify for matching on contributions to my retirement fund.  If I contribute 5% towards retirement, my university will match 7%, so I will be setting that up to take effect as soon as possible.  I had not been contributing to a retirement fund until now for two reasons: first, it wouldn't have been matched, and second, I could not enroll until I had 1 year of service (which came up a few months ago, but it slipped my mind) at the university. Probably a mistake, but I didn't really know better.

My current income and expenses are as follows:

**Income: ~$2600/month from ~$43000/year salary** (~$2000/month after tuition remission limit is exceeded, probable ~2.5% raise after June 30th)

**Expenses:** (my split in italics for shared)

Rent: $1400/month (going up to $1500 in July) *$700-750*

Utilities: ~$150/month (depending on AC/heat usage, but I am listing the high end) *$75*

Transportation: ~$80/month (subway)

Phone: $35/month (generously paid for by parents under family plan, so long as I call them and my grandparents regularly)

Internet: $44.99/month *$22.45*

Netflix: $8.99/month *$4.44*

Groceries: $300/month *$150*

Entertainment/Restaurants: $200-400/month *$100-300*

Miscellaneous: $150-200

**Total expenses: ~$1280-1580**

All possible expenses paid using CC, full balance paid off monthly.

**Debts: ~$255/month @ min payments**

Unsubsidized Stafford Loan #1: ~$8500 @ 6.8% interest, min. payment ~$100/month

Unsubsidized Stafford Loan #2: ~$8300 @ 6.8% interest, min. payment ~$90/month

Unsubsidized Stafford Loan #3: ~$5500 @ 6.8% interest, min. payment ~$65/month

No CC Debt

No Mortgage

No Auto loans

**Remainder: ~$165-1065/month** (usually on the higher end, but I try to plan my spending according to whether or not I have exceeded the tuition remission maximum)

My paycheck is autopaid into my checking account (where I currently have ~$2200) at the end of each month, and I have set up my bills (rent, utilities, CC) to automatically withdraw from there at the beginning of the next month.  Any remaining amount over ~1 month of expenses is transferred to savings, where I currently have ~$16500 receiving 0.75% APY.

**My Questions**

1. Considering what I have in checking and savings (~$18700 combined), my job and personal situation, and the loans I have remaining, how much should I keep as an emergency fund and how much should I put towards my loans?

2. To do the avalanche method properly, I should make the minimum payments on each of my two newer loans, and target as much as I can per month towards the oldest?

3. Would consolidating my loans be possible or beneficial?

4. What of the following vendors should I use for my 403(b) retirement plan? TIAA-CREF, Fidelity Investments, or the Vanguard Group?

5. Should I/would I be able to contribute more than 5% towards retirement at this time, or should I wait until my loans are paid off?

My apologies in advance for the long post, and thanks in advance for your advice and assistance.

**Update:**

I paid off loan #3 in full out of my savings leaving me with ~$11000 in that account.  I will now be focusing my payments on loan #2 since it has a lower balance (Snowball method) and the interest rates are equal.  According to unbury.us, this will have a bit of savings for me over the course of the repayment, but I could really choose either loan to start with since the difference is about $2.",finance,1400085023

personalfinance,Student Loan Questions,"Hello /r/personalfinance I'm here looking for advice about how much I can afford to pay off my student loans. Becoming debt free is very important to me and as of now, my student loans are the only major source of interest.

I have been paying ~$425/mo so far since the 6-month period after graduation has ended and the current amount of the loans is $20,600 with a 6.55% rate. I've enrolled in auto pay for the interest deduction since beginning to make the payments in January. My main goal is to pay off this debt as quickly as possible without putting myself at risk.

After taxes and 401k contributions, my take-home pay is ~$2,450/mo. My monthly expenses include TV/Internet ($68/mo), Rent ($900/mo), Food ($150/mo), Gas ($160/mo), and Electric ($43/mo). This leaves me with roughly $1,100 extra to save, pay off student loans, and extra to spend on my girlfriend. I don't know if there is anywhere I can cut down on these expenses but I'd be more than happy to hear advice on budgeting better.

Aside from my investments which I don't wish to include in this theoretical example, I have roughly $5,500 in my checking and $10,000 in savings. Both of these are making next to no interest. So what I was considering doing was making a lump payment of X amount to chunk down my loan amount, saving on interest and paying off the loans sooner for less. 

So my questions for you all are:

1. What should I keep as a safety net? I've heard anywhere from 4-6 months but I am expecting to need to relocate and find a significantly higher paying job in 6-12 months closer to my girlfriend's graduate school so I don't know if there should be an additional amount saved with that in mind. 

2. Can I afford to pay more per month? My thought process would be following #1 to keep my account balanced at X amount and then paying $400+ to maintain at that amount.

3. My parents have offered me a loan from their Heloc account which would be at 3.5%. Would there be any repercussions credit wise if I was to borrow additional money from them to pay off the loan fully and then pay them back at the lower interest rate?

4. Is there anything else I should be doing financially to help prepare for the future?

I'm working on an engineering co-op this summer (work term) with a tech company. I got my first pay stub today and I had a couple questions.

First of all, I filled out my tax forms, and through tuition payment and other tax credits, I had enough on paper to tick the little ""If your income does not exceed this bottom like, check here box"". On both provincial and federal tax forms might I had.

Fast forward to today, and I just got dinged 7% in income tax. I know its not a lot, but I kinda like money. Is there something I missed?

Two, I got dinged employment insurance (EI). If I recall correctly, you can only claim EI if you work more than a year. Since I'm only working there for 4 months, its useless. Is there something I can do about that?

I've been going over my mother's finances and we recently found a 20yr+ old account at Prudential.  If I'm not missing anything, the account seems to be guaranteed 3%+ interest per year (the plan states at least 3%, but it looks like it's been a bit over that):

(Average Annualized Interest Rates)

1Yr: 3.00%	

3Yr: 3.22%	

5Yr: 3.28%	

10Yr: 3.57%

Would it be better to keep the funds in this account or transfer to some Vanguard funds?  If it were in a Prudential mutual fund, I would transfer it over to Vanguard in a second (due to the low fees), but this is essentially guaranteed 3% with no risk if I'm not missing anything.

From what i hear from my friend who does professional tax returns is that i will receive majority of that money back since i am a college student and it was a college program.

I am currently holding the money as an emergency fund for my family as my family isn't in best income situation.

1. Paying off credit card more than monthly. 721 credit score 1.5 years ago and hoping it went up after i kept up with credit cards and payed off private school loan. ( Current $140 credit card)

3. Possible 65k job offer in one year?

4. Drive a 16 year old car with 104k miles on it. Runs ok but has $700 needed for repairs. I paid 1700 for it in Dec 2013 with 98k miles. 

5. Car insurance is 1800 yearly(liability)

Just started learning about investment and want to start early in saving for retiring. 

Should i invest in roth ira now or wait till i get full job offer first?

Should we pay the student loans (higher interest rate) first? Mortgage first? (Clear out monthly house payment to spend on student loans) or should we pay both at the same time? Should we let the money build up to where we can pay off each debt in once big payment or apply a few thousand dollars to these loans every few months?

personalfinance,"In two years I will be debt free, but where do I go from there?","Hello everyone, just wanted to reach out and ask a hypothetical question of you all that will fairly soon be my reality.

I am in the military and set to transfer from my current unit in two years.  At that time, due to my strict budgeting I will be completely debt free, having paid off my private student loans, federal student loans, car payments, and credit card debts completely.  I have learned how to budget well to defeat debt, but I am unsure on what to do after.  I do have a TSP Roth IRA started, but little put into it because I am actively working towards defeating debt.

The situation will be as follows (with lowball numbers). I am married.  We would like to be expecting or have a child soon after this point as well.  I will be 31 years old. My wife will likely be working off and on, but I do not want to rely on it for this matter.  I will be eligible for a VA home loan (from what I understand, matches lowest market interest with no money down).  I will be just shy of 6 years time in and will be going to 20 years (45 years of age).

I will be making approximately 54k after taxes at my projected paygrade and time in service, and based on average BAH for likely unit locations. So roughly 4500 a month. Likely monthly expenditures would be:

Phone bill: $100

Internet: $50 (We do not purchase television, ever)

Insurances (two cars): $175

Rent / Mortgage: (See Below)

Utilities: Anywhere from $50 to $200 depending on area.

My main concern and cause for asking you all this is two problems. 

First I would like to make sure I set enough aside for a child's college fund and a retirement fund, and begin an emergency savings.  What are the best options for these and at what amounts should I contribute monthly?

Second, I am worried about not building equity in a home. I do not want to buy my first home at 45 and start payments immediately as I begin collecting my pension. With the VA loan I could purchase a home at my unit location, but after 4 years I would likely have to move away.  I would like to pay off this 30 year mortgage by the time I am retired or shortly after, so within roughly 14-15 years.  What target price would I be looking at to do this for a reasonably nice home (use Virginia / Washington D.C. as an example location for pricing).  After I transfer, I would likely have to use a property manager to continue renting out the home and I would rent at my new location.

Am I crazy to think this is a good idea?  Is it simply not feasible on what my income will be?  This is a lowball number for my income, it would likely actually be around 60k by this time, but I do not want to overshoot in my planning, and if I transferred to a low cost of living area and my BAH dropped it would be hard to keep up.

Would this be too risky?  What's the best course of action!?  Help!

Should I be taking advantage of Roth or IRA accounts instead of just adding to my 401k contributions?

What accounts should I look into for my EF other than my savings?

How do I budget for major home improvement projects? I am looking into a bigger project that would add significant value to the home. Do I save up the cash or look into home equity loans?

With a 4.125% interest rate on my mortgage, I should invest any extra money rather than make additional payments, correct?

Repeated failure to report income penalty
If you failed to report an amount on your return for 2013, and you also failed to report an amount on your return for 2010, 2011, or 2012, you may have to pay a federal and provincial/territorial repeated failure to report income penalty.

However, if you voluntarily tell us about an amount you failed to report, we may waive these penalties. For more information, see Voluntary Disclosures Program.

Around $60K of my loans are held by the Department of Education and have an interest rate of either 7.9% or 8.5%.  I just got something in the mail from a private company that says I can get interest rates as low as 5% by consolidating.

However, on Reddit, there's always a lot of discussion around Senator Warren and her plans to lower the interest rates ([Source](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/14/us-usa-senate-students-idUSBREA4D0Q220140514)). There's also been discussion (although no legislation) to forgive some student loan debt (I doubt it). But my guess is your loans would have to be owned by the Department of Education to take advantage of this incentive.

Do you think it's worthwhile to consolidate all or a portion of my student loans at a lower interest rate with a private company or should I wait it out and hope the legislature acts on the student loan bubble? Any thoughts would be appreciated.

My wife and I just (like last month) purchased a house for $300,000 with 10% down and a 4.5% interest rate. Our take home pay is about $6,000/month after all of our insurance, tax, and matching 401k for each of our companies. Our only other debt is a student loan for $7,000 at 5.5%. In addition, we have about $20,000 tucked away for emergencies and some (somewhat) planned medical things that could cost us upwards of 10k in the next year or so.

An outline: 
•	$2,200/mo for mortgage, insurance, taxes, and PMI
•	$175/mo for student loan
•	$1,700/mo for bills and groceries
•	$2,000/mo to do what we need to do/play with

1. **Where should I put the severance payment?** Should I open a savings account to hold it? Just dump it all into my checking account? (I don't currently have a savings account. I know, I know.)

1. **What should I do with my 401(k)?** I assume roll it into some sort of IRA, but I know pretty much nothing about them.

---

Here are relevant rounded numbers. Let me know if there's anything else you need.

## Assets:

* **Checking account:** Currently $2,500 (probably at least $6,000 by June 30)

* **Retirement savings:** $48,400 in a fully vested 401(k)

* **Severance payment:** $13,300 pre-tax ($9,975 after 25% tax is withheld)

## Debt:

* **Student loan:** $4,600 to completely pay it off (2.1% interest)

## Income (after June 30):

* **Unemployment benefits:** $370/week (maximum for WI)

## Outgo (after June 30):

* **Rent:** $530/mo

* **Student loan:** $250/mo (can go down to $185 immediately; can probably go lower)

* **All utilities and services:** No more than $200/mo (assumes a very cold winter month)

* **Transportation:** No more than $65/mo

* **Medical coverage:** $40/week to continue current coverage through COBRA for the first 90 days; after that, I'll probably get a cheap plan from the federal exchange

* **Food:** ??? (I'll have a weekly CSA box of fresh produce for June through August, so that's a lot taken care of already)",finance,1400173772
personalfinance,Emergency Fund Strategy,"I need about $2000 / month (rounded up, it's probably closer to 1800); I have about $10k spread over several accounts as follows: 

* $1000 immediate access in my checking account at 0% interest
* $1000 in an account I use as escrow for paying revolving payments (mortgage, heating oil, power, internet, phone)
* Just under $8000 in a dedicated emergency fund account at Capital One at 0.75% interest.  This takes 5 days to access, which is not a problem, because:

I also have a $20k credit line that I can use while I transfer money from the Capital One account into checking.

My emergency fund should be between $6k-12k, so the amount that I have is sufficient; however it occurred to me that I could do better than 0.75% interest.  My idea is keep the minimum emergency fund in cash, $6k, spread over the accounts, and make a ""second tier"" emergency fund by investing the other $4k in a basic bond ETF like BND.  Again, I can use the credit line while I sell the bonds if necessary, so I don't need instant access to the money.

Technically, I wouldn't even need to have that money in my emergency fund at all, since I've met the minimum requirement of 3 months, so it makes sense to me to try and do a little better than 0.75% with it.

I've also seen the suggestion to buy I-Bonds, but I-bonds have a lower interest rate than BND.  Any other ideas?",finance,1400174491

Realized I hated the stress and long hours so I have a temporary office job. I was supposed to be hired on full time with a raise after 3 months. However, due to a lockout of unionized labor the company is on a hiring freeze. I am not a union worker but I work in a field that employs union workers. Anyways its been 5 months since being hired and I feel that my future here is uncertain. As I look for a new job I could really use some help budgeting, I have been just scraping by or in many weeks spending more than I make.

I earn 14 an hour and work 40 hours per week. I have an extra 15 withheld from both federal and state taxes so I earn about 380 to 400 per week. 

Rent is 550 per month. Car insurance is 80 per month. Student loan repayment is 200 per month. I try to spend no more than 60 per week on groceries including beer and drinks excluding dining out. I spend about 30 per week on gas. 40 per month on a gym membership. Fortunately I am still on a family cellphone and health insurance plan but I have to pay all dr. bills. Due to intense treatment for crohn's I spend about 200 every other month on dr. bills.

Net income per month =~1600
Total expenses = 550+200+240+80+40+120+100(half dr. bill)=~1350 per month. Leaving me with roughly 250 per month for non-necessities.

finance,Question about private student loan payment,"So recently, I found out that mygreatlakes applies payments in such a way:

(a)   Payment equal to or less than the scheduled monthly payment amount. These payments are applied first to any late fees, next to interest (until all accrued interest is paid), and then pro rata across the principal balance of the loans. However, if payments are being made on any of the Income-Based Repayment Plans, payments are applied first to interest, next to late fees and then to principal. 
 
(b)   Payments greater than the scheduled monthly payment amount. If you make a monthly payment that is more than the scheduled payment amount, we first apply the amount of the payment that is equal to the scheduled monthly payment amount, as described in (a). The additional amount will be applied first to any remaining unpaid accrued interest and then to the principal balance. If an  account has multiple loans, the additional amount is applied first to any remaining unpaid accrued interest and then to the principal balance of the unsubsidized loan with the highest interest rate.
 
(c)   Extra Payments. If you make an additional payment during a month, it will be applied as described in (a). 

Currently I am paying $1000 a month through 4 payments of $250 weekly. I had always thought this would lower my principal the fastest, since there would be little time for interest to accrue.

Now I am second guessing myself. Would it be smarter for me to pay one big payment of $1000 a month? In order for a greater payment amount to be applied to the principle with the highest tax percentage?

Currently, I have four loans at 5%, 6%, 8% and 8.25% interest rates.

I've been speaking with a lender who believes a HELOC will work for me and be able to get me about $50k that would cost me about $300 a month.  Now, the obvious here is HELOCS are adjustable - but, those fixed rate 2nds are hard to come by and more expensive, from my understanding.

personalfinance,"Take an extra year or two with school, or take out another loan?","Hey everyone! Been having some trouble trying to make a decision, and was hoping to get some advice on how I should handle my current financial situation.

Right now, I am 22 and have two years left in school. I am currently an English major and plan to pursue a career in academia or journalism. I am slated for a graduation date in Spring 2016. Currently, I have nearly $29,000 in debt of both unsubsidized and subsidized federal loans (6.8% interest I think. Thankfully my subsidized loans make up more than half of that), and a smaller loan I took out from Discover at $3000 (9.8% interest). With two more years of school, my federal loans will be at $42,000.

Do you think it would be a bad idea to take out another Discover loan for school? It would probably be another $12,000. Or should take a lighter load, allowing me to work more so that I can work more and avoid taking out another loan  (So I'd graduate in Spring '17; one year later). 

I really want to finish up with school, so I am trying to figure out if an extra $12,000 would cripple me. I figured if I could land a job within a  year of graduating, and that offers the average starting salary for English majors (I think it's $34,000), I should be able to pay off all my loans within 12-15 years. I also heard that loans can even be deferred if you are pursing a career in Education? I am just having a hard time figuring out if $60,000 in student loan debt is going to ruin me.

personalfinance,Difficult Job Decision involving startup,"I am facing a difficult job decision and I don't have a lot of friends with experience in this area, so I'm wanting to know what /r/pf has to say.  I'm a regular contributer here and usually the advice is very solid, so I'm wanting an opinion not as biased as my own.

I've been offered a job at a start up company contracting for a 3 letter agency of the US Govt.  I am currently working at another contracting company for that same agency.  Here's the stats:

**Old Job:**

* Company of around 250 people, well established with many govt contracts on which I could be placed and overhead if I were to have a contract dropped.
* ~$73,000 annual salary
* 9% 401k match
* 8% annual (Christmas) bonus
* Health insurance paid 90% (costs around 100 a month)

**New Job:**

* Company of 5 people started up last year (early 2013) and has 2 contracts but only 1 staffed.  No overhead and minimal * expenses.
* ~$130,000 annual salary offered
* 10% 401(k) match
* no bonus
* free annual trip to Bahamas for me and wife for company ""team building""
* Health Insurance paid 80% (costs around 200 a month)

Obviously the new job is higher risk, but if my math is right the new job would be a $50,000 increase counting benfits.  All other things being equal this would be an awesome opportunity, but I'm worried about the fact that it's such a small company.

They don't have any chance of losing thier contract for another 3 years, and in that time they will obviously be seeking to grow the company.  My plan would be to take the job and work for those 3 years (I'm unlikely to be fired as I'm good at what I do, and well respected by those who know my work).  If they lay me off in 3 years I'll be close to $80k to the good (after taxes), and able to afford taking the hit to be unemployed for a bit.  On top of that my skills are highly desirable and I'm not likely to be unemployed long.

**Other facts:**

* I'm a software engineer working for defense department with TS clearance
* I'm only a mid-level, so not expensive for most employers
* I'm married with no children, my wife works part time, but no where near enough to support us
* I rent with no mortgage
* I have an emergency fund of just over 3 months expenses ($10,000) and an additional $15,000 in a roth I could tap in emergencies.
* my current monthly cashflow is $1000 positive so I'm putting away money at the moment
* cutting expenses to the bone would probably make my emergency fund last 4 months
* I would plan to use the excess income from this job to boost the emergency fund in case of lay-off (contract loss)",finance,1400197197

I really want to get another perspective on my focuses financially and make sure I am putting my energy towards the right things while I am young and have the advantage of time on my side.

A little bit on context -- I do have student loan debt. All in, around ~30k  with about 5.5% interest, the bulk of which (25k) is federally consolidated and the remaining, 1k and 4k, being separate loans. I make about 57k a year including bonuses. I don't own a home but rent an apartment.

My objective since I've started working professionally a few years ago is to try to get my school debt paid off as soon as possible. I've been using the Dave Ramsey method for a while, but in all honesty, I've kind of half-assed it to a degree. I have an emergency fund of a little over $1000 meant to accommodate emergencies, but I've also contributed the max employer match to my 401k of 6% (I just hate leaving free money on the table). I've been putting as much as I can towards my largest loan amount and have cut it down quite a bit.

My concerns are a couple of things... for one, I don't really have a lot in savings which just terrifies me (which to my knowledge is basically the point of the small emergency fund-- to drive the urgency that is supposed to kick in to try to get debt paid off immediately). I'm also looking to get engaged probably within the next 8 months, which means a ring and a wedding will come to play in the future. These are large expenses I know I'll need to tackle and I'm finding it difficult to strategize for these.

Am I on the right track and thinking about the priorities the right way? Should I be saving more now, then paying off debt seriously again with more money in the bank?

personalfinance,Paying Off Student Loans vs. Saving for a House Mortgage,"Hello everyone,

I have just graduated from law school and started work at a big law firm.  I exited the program with 150k in student loan debt, but have a 120k per year job.  I am currently renting a house with my fiancee, but would of course like to eventually buy my own.  The interest rate on the student loans ranges from 4.25 to 6.8% per year.  The average across 150k is approximately 4.8% (the 6.8% part is a small portion of the total).  

I can set aside approximately $4,000 per month to either go towards paying off my student loans or saving up for a mortgage down payment.  I am leaning towards making a big dent in my student loans first, as I can't help but prefer to spend money to pay down an outstanding debt rather than put it in a savings account to buy a house when I still have those outstanding student loans.  On the other hand, I also know that money spent on rent is gone forever, whereas money put into a house has at least a decent chance of coming back to me when I sell the house years/decades later.  My fiancee and I are actually pretty happy renting the house we are in now (good deal, good area, etc) and are not in a hurry to move for any reason other than to enter a better financial situation.  The rent for our current house is $1600 per month, which my fiancee and I split evenly (she has a separate income stream of approximately 32k per year after taxes). 

What percentage of the $4,000 I can save per month would  you recommend putting into paying off my student loans, and what percentage should I save for a house down payment?  Houses in my area are easily 400k to 600k, so even a 10% down payment will take a while to save up.  Should I start out paying a lot more into my student loans, and then switch after a year or a few years?  What would you recommend?

With the help of my friends on Reddit I would like to break those chains and make it a drivers sport again. My brother and I are determined, we are a great pair of wheelmen, and we are desperately clawing our way to the top on the money we our fortunate enough to receive from our small business. You guys put Josh Wise back in a car, now it's your turn to put two humble hopefuls in the lead. Put an end to the spoiled rich kid NASCAR driver days with the help of Dogecoin!    


Here's the deal, I am a 19 year old Pro Late Model Stock car driver and my brother is a 13 year old Pro Late Model Stock car driver. We are different ages but started racing at roughly the same time back in 2005- I have been racing since I was 11 and he has been since he was only five. We are currently sponsorless and strapped for cash running down at our local short track, i44 speedway, which draws a large crowed every Saturday night. I am among the youngest stock car drivers at the track and in the nation and my brother IS the youngest stock car driver at the track, the nation (I think), and probably in the world at just (barely) 14 years old. My brother is leading the track championship right now and due to bad luck my first three races I am in about 10th of 25 competitors. 

...and yes, we are legitimate (check the latest post):

Some background information- The family business does make enough to compete in the cars we run, but most of the people we are up against own GIANT corporations, some of them even associated with the government. Here is a pic of me (the older one) and my brother. My car has a Harley Davidson paint job on it because a dealer in North Carolina offered to pay for said paint scheme so I wouldn't have a plain white car. My brother's car is just plain red. Both cars would be repainted with Doge schemes.

I am proposing that we need to expand the power and reach of the Dogecoin name and the best way to do that is put it on another two race cars. As of now our cars are front runners at i44 speedway and the class we are in resembles that of NASCAR quite well, but cost a fraction of the price to race in. With more funding I think we could win the track championship, the entire Midwest championship, and look at competing in a national series next year- if not get into a higher level of racing all together. 


Between the two of us I would like to raise as much as possible for this year and with that run two Doge painted cars, have official Doge short track gear, and appear at interviews, trade shows, causes, displays, charitable events, and possibly on TV. 


 


I am a marketing major at Maryville University and I have just recently completed my freshman year, here are a few ideas that I have devised so far:

personalfinance,"Private student loan interest rates, how much can they increase?","Hello again, 

So I spent this evening mapping out a snowball repayment plan for my mix of private and federal student loans. 

I currently have the following loans outstanding:
http://i.imgur.com/ouBaJHy.png


My plan is, not very aggressive to be honest, but we've got a baby on the way so I don't know how aggressive we can afford to be. 
I built a full amortization schedule for each loan with a column for 'extra payment' that I'm using to build some modeling around how my extra payments impact the payoff dates.

Right now I'm planning on increasing the amounts of each payments by $25 each year (I'll probably adjust this up to be honest, but an increase of $100 extra per month per year isn't hard to swallow), on top of paying an additional $1000-2000 every January when I get my bonus. I had originally loaded all my bonuses on the WellsFargo loan as it carries the highest interest, but I found that if I loaded them onto the current 'focus' loan (Starting with the smallest and working my way up to the federal) it shortened my payoffs by around 4 months overall, and only increased my interest expense around $400 over the roughly 6 years of payoff. 

Does this sound like a reasonable approach? I would normally have focused all payoff on the highest interest rate (Avalanche) to reduce interest expense, but it lengthened the payoff time for all of the loans substantially, and only saved me a couple grand in interest. 

I know my private student loans carry variable interest rates, whereas my federal are fixed as far as I can tell. So given that at some point, interest rates will rise, is this still a good strategy? I'm also considering going on the Graduated repayment plan for my federal loans to increase my monthly cashflow on the short term. I haven't figured out how I can calculate what each tier would be under that payment plan, so I haven't been able to model it yet. 

If anyone would be interested in taking a look at my excel workbook let me know and I can figure out how to share it.",finance,1400216410
personalfinance,"Part-time Private Tutoring, very confused on how/when to file taxes","Firstly, if this is in the wrong place or I'm violating any subreddit rules, I'm terribly sorry, and request that the mod who deletes this PM me to let me know what I should do differently. I've read over the rules and don't believe I'm violating any, but I've been wrong before.

I work as a part-time tutor. I only have 3 clients. Two of them pay by personal check, simple enough.

My third (and largest by far) client pays me via direct deposit from his medical practice. Social Security and Medicaid are withheld from this, but not Federal Income Tax. 

So essentially, I'm  making 90+% of my revenue from a source that pays me with Social Security/Medicare withheld, 10% from multiple sources that don't, and none of it has Federal Income Tax withheld.

I haven't spent a dime of this money, and have kept detailed records.

I make about ~$1100/month from this part time employment, and have no idea how to go about filing my taxes. 

From what I can gather I'm supposed to file quarterly based on my own estimation of how much I will earn. Estimating this is pretty much impossible, however, as I see swings of as much as 40% difference in income from this depending on the time of year. This month, for instance, I'm working double the hours because finals are approaching. I have no idea if any of my students will want help over the summer, either, or how much I'll be able to continue in the fall as I start full-time college then.

Where should I go for this information? The IRS website has seemed well put together, but with nothing covering a situation like mine. 

Withholding calculators likewise seem great, but nothing in there about a certain % of my income already having SS/Medicaid taken out.

dogecoin,"Before I Came Here, I Was Cheap and Kind of a Dick","* Hey everyone! My friend wrote this about me for our new website. I just wanted to share with you all! I will be posting cool articles and excerpts every now and then. Feel free to check us out on [shibescoop.com.](http://shibescoop.com)

Silk Road forever tarnished the reputation as Bitcoin.  Using Silk Road, people took refuge in the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency to commit heinous crimes.  I don’t mention this to imply that Bitcoin hasn’t been an amazing innovation.  It has. 

 Bitcoin has forever altered the way we think about currency and money. In my view, the pace at which information and communication travel has had the effect of decentralizing and challenging traditional centers of power.  For example, in some scholars’ estimation, the globalization of today’s economy has so drastically freed the flow of capital that national governments can no longer effectively wield the levers of economic policy to control the economy.  Cryptocurrency does the same in a small way.

For something to be a store of value, it doesn’t need to be controlled and distributed by the government. We, the people, are also capable of creating stores of value — we don’t always need the government. Granted, the US dollar and many other official currencies are more stable than Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other such currencies, but having an alternative currency raises the purchasing power of the people and increases their ability to hold their governments’ accountable for the monetary policy they draft by decentralizing power. The case with Bitcoin, however, seems that some portion of the power and freedom created by the currency ended up going to people
willing to abuse it.

Maybe we learned from Bitcoin’s early missteps or maybe people are just changing for the better, but thus far, Dogecoin seems different.

It’s an amazing community in terms of its initiative and its heart.

Bitcoin has Silk Road.  Dogecoin has Talladega.

I was on Reddit this morning where I found a post titled “You shibes have quite the effect on people.”  See, I haven’t spent all that much time in the Dogecoin community. For the past few months though, it’s been a fairly big presence in my life, because when my best friend found it a few months ago, I think it changed his life in a way. I was on Reddit, because I wanted to learn more about a community and a phenomenon that’s a big part of my friends’ lives so I clicked on the link, and that’s how this article came into being.""Before I came here, I was cheap and kind of a dick""

It was that bear meme with the shibe’s eyes and facial expression photoshopped on, but that’s not really the point. As with many memes, the point was the pithy quote, or in this case, the heartwarming one: “Before I came here I was cheap and kind of a dick.”

We all know Dogecoin has done positive things for people. They funded an Olympic team that wouldn’t have otherwise been able to attend. At Dogecon SF, Dogecoin creator and keynote speaker Jackson Palmer noted that during Dogecoin’s 138 day life (at the time of the conference), more than $100,000 in Dogecoin has been raised for different charitable purposes. That is $724.64 in Dogecoin contributed to charity per day.  It’s impressive — that’s for sure, but undoubtedly, there are wealthy individuals and corporations whose contributions dwarf those of Dogecoin, but that’s not the point I’m trying to make here. I’m not saying that Dogecoin is the most amazing thing to hit the planet, because it donates to charity. It’s not the first to do so and certainly won’t be the last.

The point is that the community positively impacts the lives of not only those it helps through charitable endeavors, but also the members of the community. I think that’s special. These days, we do too many things and participate in too many things because we “have to” rather than because we want to or because we enjoy it or because it makes us a better person.

For example, this fall, I took a class on dance appreciation not because I wanted to or because it would make me happy but because my university has a fine arts requirement.

The Dogecoin community doesn’t seem like that to me. It’s like a group of friends that cracks inside jokes and helps each other and others out.  It’s kind of awesome.

In my view, and maybe I’m wrong (I’m sure he’ll correct me), my friend found the Dogecoin community at a time when he was losing motivation because of the pressures and hurdles life sometimes throws at you. He wants to become an investment banker or venture capitalist, and the pressure of that along with all the things you “have to” do to graduate and be successful had made him lose sight of why he wanted those things in the first place.

Dogecoin though, and cryptocurrency, reignited the spark. He was passionate again about investing, innovations, and entrepreneurship. His passion for cryptocurrency helped him land multiple internships, and since then, he has taken on a million different entrepreneurial projects.  There’s this website.  He created and built his own mining rig. He is in the process of creating an online college bookstore that accepts Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Litecoin as payment.  These are all good things if you ask me.

Right now, Dogecoin feels like one of those good things in the world that improves the planet we live on in small but measurable ways.

So I guess, keep doing what you’re doing :)

Bitcoin,The Pros of Circle and BitReserve: no more ACH fraud.,"Hey guys, Circle and BitReserve are not bitcoin. We get that, no debate. So why would people use them, what do they solve?

The answer is ACH fraud. ACH fraud is a huge problem for online banking and credit/debit services. Hundreds of millions yearly are flat out lost due to ACH fraud. It is a problem that still largely results in no consequences to the hacker conglomerate that pulls it off. ACH fraud occupies the time of at least 4 federal regulatory agencies on a daily basis, and the Department of Justice and the Department of State.

""ACH fraud is the theft of funds through the Automated Clearing House financial transaction network. The ACH network acts as the central clearing facility for all Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) transactions in the United States, representing a crucial link in the national banking system. Payments linger in the ACH network awaiting clearance for their final banking destination."" So, while banks and credit cards try to make consumers and merchants whole after a theft, they are just eating the losses and practically begging for the government to do something about it.

This is a problem that plagues ""statist banks"", and Circle accomplishes a solution to that problem without introducing the deflationary aspect of the solution to its users.

So yes, bitcoin by itself also results in no more ACH fraud. But Circle and BitReserve are just using it as a tool, which everyone is free to do, while also creating a business plan around solving a modern day problem.

These are gateway drugs to using bitcoin and blockchain technology.",cryptocurrency,1400234615

personalfinance,"100k in debt, unemployed, and all with a STEM degree (Engineering). If I run away will my credit follow me?","As the title says, I am currently approx 100k in debt, all from student loans. This is a combination of federal loans (appx 30k) and private loans (70k). I am currently in my grace period (graduated in December) but will be expected to make first payments within a month.

Now, I hold a Canadian citizenship in addition to my American. Recently I have been contemplating running away to Canada and restarting my life there. What are the consequences of doing so? Would my credit-score follow me there? My debt? Do Canadian credit agencies work in tandem with American ones? Also I do have a cosigner on the loans, what happens on their end?

[EDIT]  

Sorry, I should have elaborated on my degree/situation in a bit more detail.
My degree: Chemical Engineering..... but wait..... low GPA (2.68) and no experience (spent summers doing manual labor jobs).

My problem the way I see it is that given my situation any actual entry level job in engineering are out of the question. Furthermore, I can't even get a job at McDonald s if I tried to because I would be over-qualified.

Now I find myself in a pinch. Over-qualified for low-wage positions and under-qualified for entry. Seems like it would have been smarter to just skip uni and get a job right out of High School no? Wouldnt be 100k in debt and have 4 years of lost wages. Additionally, I now have 100k in loans that are about to hit my in the face like a tone of bricks.

I have been out of college for going on 5 years now and have been making diligent payments on a regular schedule, without missing any, on my current student loan debt.  I have a mixture of federal stafford loans and signature student loans from Sallie Mae (currently $25,xxx remaining balance) and some direct sub and unsub loans that were sold to Aspire resources inc. ($8,5xx balance).  I am wondering how I have been paying for 5 years and this is nowhere near half of the initial amount of the loans (including interest).  I always figured after 5 years, half would be payed off.  I tried to look up details of repayment and other info but it is all so overwhelming.  I vaguely remember hearing something about first the payments go primarily towards interest, and the principal will be payed off at higher amounts later in the repayment cycle.  Is this a thing?

personalfinance,I would like some advice please. (nyc),"I live in nyc with my girlfriend and a roommate, upper manhattan at the moment.  Gf and I have been looking at homes to buy in Manhattan, all above 96th due to our budget.  Our lease is up at the end of August and we can't stay in our current apt.  We want to buy a 2 bedroom because we think it is a better investment than a one bedroom.  Thing is,  the market is very tight right now and there is not a lot of inventory.  Places move quickly and often get bid out of our price range.  Our idea is that we would buy a place, sell in 5-7 years for profit hopefully, then use that money to buy a 3-4 bedroom home in the city to raise a family.  We've been thinking about HDFC, as we could potentially buy a beat up 3-4br for under 400k, then fix it up over time, but they are not so easy to come by either.  I'm also skeptical as to if a an HDFC is really a solid investment.  That is what this boils down to: an investment to pay for the home we can live in for 30 years.  Not sure if maybe we rent and try to save money for that, our savings go up but so will prices and more importantly interest rates.  What should I do to maximize our chances of getting our dream house in 5-7years.  Here's some numbers
Ages: 25 &amp; 27
Combined income: 120k
Take home(after retirement investment, insurance etc): 5.2k per month
Savings account:75k(was in 3 different investment accounts, I consolidated because we thought we would need it soon and liquid for down payment
Debt: zero!!!
Credit score: 810
We have capped our budget at a sharp ceiling of 400k as we could get a one time gift from parents of around 15k for a down payment, but 400k is kind of pushing it I feel.  We do not want to live in the parts of queens or Brooklyn that we can afford on our budget.  I love this woman we have been together for six years, want to be together for all the rest.  Should we rent for 5 more years, all the while looking for the perfect place?  Should I invest it and give up looking for a while.  Is the home as good of an investment as I think it is right now?

personalfinance,What makes the most sense financially - student loan or 401k distribution?,"So I'm trying to figure out the best way to manage my finances for the next couple of years.  I took some time off of school and worked/saved for a while, and now I've been back in school for some 5 years.  Throughout that time I've been paying tuition and living off of my savings.  However, this cash is going to run out at around the end of this calendar year.  At that point, I'll still have 1.5 years left before I finish my degree and then get out working, so I'm trying to determine the best way to finance those couple years.  Some pertinent information:

* Living expenses:  $20k/year
* Tuition:              ~$20k/year (a little more, but usually there are some token grants/scholarships that show up
* Savings:             Want to keep just a bit, for unexpected expenses and the like
* 401k:                  ~$150k, been getting around 10% return the past 5 years (though this year has been crap so far)
* Possible loan:       Federal Direct Unsubsidized, $40k/year (so $60k total), at 6.8% interest?

The interest on the federal loan may not be 6.8%, that was based on older information.  From what I can see [here](http://www.direct.ed.gov/calc.html), it may be 5.41%, though I don't know what it will be if I don't take disbursements until the new year (graduate/professional student). 

So I could take a withdrawal from my 401k to pay for this, which avoids some fees but certainly not tax.  Or I could take the loan and have debt hanging over me which I hate, but may make the most sense.  As far as paying off the student loans goes, I'll be making enough money to make at least interest payments once I graduate, but may not be able to make much of a dent in the principal balance for another 3-5 years.

I know, it probably would have made more sense to take cheap loans from the beginning and invest the money I have been using to pay for all this, but I really do hate owing anything. 

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.  Or if you need more info from me, feel free to ask.  I'll be checking during study breaks.

personalfinance,Why pay off student loans before maxing out 401k?,"After lurking on reddit for a while, you guys here at PF have finally drawn me out of the shadows.  Here’s my situation: After having most of our surplus cash flow go towards wedding expenses, house down payment, home improvements and medical bills for what seems like an eternity, it appears that my wife and I are finally about to have some decent cash left over at the end of the month to go towards investment/debt reduction, and I am trying to figure out where the money should go first.  I have about $55k in student loans, with a 5.25% interest rate.  I am also currently contributing $6.5k/yr to my 401k (the amount I need to get the full employer match).  Our marginal income tax rate is 25%.  

The conventional wisdom on here seems to be that, once you are getting your full employer match in your 401k, you should then pay off debt before maxing out the 401k contributions, but I am having trouble understanding the reasoning behind that.  There is currently an additional $11k/yr that I can contribute to my 401k before maxing it out, which would realize an immediate 25% return in tax savings, plus compounding returns on the contributions after that.  Additionally, since there is a yearly limit on 401k contributions, if I forgo contributions this year, I can’t make up for them after the student loans are paid off.  So by focusing all of my surplus cash flow on my student loans, I would be losing a couple years of maximum 401k contributions, and after factoring in the 30 or so years of compounding returns I would have received on the lost 401k contributions, it seems like I am giving up some serious money.  

I realize that paying off the student loans is a risk free 5.25% return, but it is not like my 401k is exactly high risk, and the tax savings and compounding returns seem to be more than adequate compensation for that additional risk.  It seems to me that my first $11k of surplus cash should go into the 401k, (which will get me an immediate $2,750 in tax savings that can be applied directly to my student loans), and any surplus cash after that can then be applied to the student loans.  

Am I overlooking something here?  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!",finance,1400257668

Some background information- The family business does make enough to compete in the cars we run, but many of the people we are up against own GIANT corporations, some of them even associated with the government. Here are a few pics of me (the older one) and my brother. My car has a Harley Davidson paint job on it because a dealer in North Carolina offered to pay for said paint scheme so I wouldn't have a plain white car. My brother's car is just plain red. Both cars would be repainted with Doge schemes.

I am proposing that we need to expand the power and reach of the Dogecoin name and the best way to do that is put it on another two race cars. As of now our cars are front runners at i44 speedway and the class we are in resembles that of NASCAR quite well, but cost a fraction of the price to race in. With more funding I think we could win the track championship, the entire Midwest championship, and look at competing in a national series next year- if not get into a higher level of racing all together. 
Between the two of us I would like to raise as much money as possible this year and with that run two Doge painted cars, have official Doge short track gear, and appear at interviews, trade shows, causes, displays, charitable events, and possibly on TV. 

I am a marketing major at Maryville University and I have just recently completed my freshman year, here are a few ideas that I have devised so far: 

Donors over $10 will have a decal of their Reddit name printed and placed somewhere on one of the race cars. Your name will then be featured on our Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram page as well as our website and this page right here. 

Doge team shirts will be made and sold for Dogecoins (although I am not entirely sure how to do this yet) 

The drivers and cars will visit children's hospitals and give out Doge stuffed animals funded entirely by you guys as well as let the kids look at, touch, and sit in the cars. 

PLEASE offer up any further ideas that you think could work!!! 


Edit: I could see how some of you think this falls along the lines of ""self promotion"" and therefor is spam, but keep in mind that all proceeds do go to a legitimate NASCAR short track team and therefor would be used to not only introduce the Doge to people in Lebanon Missouri, but also across the web like Josh Wise. You are doing the Doge a service by expanding its racing team.

personalfinance,To co-sign or not to co-sign?,"Alright, settle in. 
My SO (26m), who is in dire need to get out from under New Jersey class student loans has been trying to consolidate or move the debt under a different servicer since he graduated in 2011. NJclass has all but refused to work with him in any meaningful way. His monthly payment is about $800 and his total debt is hovering between 80-90K with the lowest interest rate set at 6.8+. He has been lucky enough to have been employed semi regularly since he graduated, but he has gone thru lay offs and periods of time where his income never came close to what NJclass demanded him to pay, no income based repayment options, no forbearance, nothing. During those times making that full payment has been impossible and it lead to late or partial payments being made which made his situation worse. As of now that $800/ is all interest and he can't save any money because most of his pay checks go there and because of all of this his credit is not great. We rent and pay $425/m and our utilities usually don't break $100, other expenses are kept very low. It has been seeming for quite a while that his only hope in getting any kind of foot hold on his situation is to consolidate and get his loans away from NJ class. Unfortunately, his family cannot help him by co-signing because their credit is also trashed (they are less than great with money). This is where I come in: Luckily, I am fortunate enough to have an excellent credit score, and all of my loans are federal (I owe just under 50k). I am able to make my payments easily and always pay well above the minimum. I have a steady work history and make 33k/yr. The SO, reluctantly came to me to ask if I would be willing to entertain the idea of co-signing for consolidation with him. I know he wouldn't ask unless I was his only other option... The consolidator ( cu student loans  ) states that after 12 months of on time payments the co-signer may request to be released from the obligation. And, with my credit score it stands to reason he would be able to get his monthly payment down way lower than it is now allowing him to actually save some money in a savings or emergency fund. We have been talking it over and I can see both sides of this. On one hand, I see a future with this person and I know he is doing all he can to get a handle on these loans. He is good with money outside of all of this and I hate watching him just get crushed at every turn by NJclass when he tries to do anything to get a hold on the debt. On the other hand, co-signing is never a good idea. This is a huge risk for me as my credit is our life raft ( that and I have worked hard to get it where it's at) as far as him making the payments on time I have no worries, but I am worried about the unforeseen hiccups that can occur (what if he or I is laid off or is seriously injured?) I have told him that *if* I were to do this I could only offer my backing with my credit score, that I couldn't take on the payments if something were to happen. While his parents have shit credit because of bad choices, they do have the income to help him if they wanted to, which I hope they would in an emergency. My parent's have offered the same (bad credit, but would offer money in the event of an emergency if something unforeseen arose and the on time payments were put at risk)

What should we do? I want to help if I can, but this is a massive risk. If this was any one else the obvious answer would be ""no"". but this is a person I see a future with and as it looks loan consolidation may be his only out and while he makes enough income, he just doesn't have the credit to do so and I'm the only one willing or able to possibly even *try* to help.

Any advice, any help, any suggestions would be so appreciated. If there is another way to do this we are all ears, he would probably do anything if it meant not having me co sign, we are quite literally out of ideas for him to the point that debt dodging to Canada has started to sound less like a joke and more like an actual option, and bankruptcy (if it even *were* an option) would be a dream come true.",finance,1400261874
personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans?,"Does anyone have any experience with refinancing student loans?

I recently refinanced my mortgage, and the same basic concepts should apply.

- Pay some upfront processing fees.
- Pick a loan term (5, 10, 15 years... etc..)
- Get a new Loan Rate.

The student loan refinance might being a bit different since (to my understanding), student loans don't have a set time/term. 

My girlfriend just graduated with a Masters of Nursing as a Nurse Practitioner and has about $80k in student loan debt. $10k at 7.5% and $70k at 5.5%.

She has a job as a nurse now and has a nurse practitioner lined up that should pay $80k/year+.

I am advising her to put the first $10k on a 0% interest rate transfer balance credit card and pay that off before the 0% term ends.

Are their better companies to refinance student loan debt with? Anyone have any good information or experience?

personalfinance,Mix of private and federal student loans from undergad. What to do about grad school?,"Hi financial gurus!

As the title says, I have a mix of student loans from my undergraduate studies and here's the breakdown:

* Private Loan #1 - 4.75% APR locked. Balance: $34,000. Current payment $200/month
* Private Loan #1 - 7.4% APR locked. Balance: $24,000. Current payment $213/month
* Federal Loan #1 - 1.54% APR locked. Balance : $9,500. Current payment $0/month on IBR - counts as qualifying PSLF payment.
* Federal Loan #2 - 6.5% APR locked. Balance $8,700. Current payment $0/month on IBR - counts as qualifying PSLF payment.

For a grand total of $76,000. Wow. That's a shitload of money. I ended up doing 6 years in undergrad because I was pushed into school and didn't know what I want to do....anyway, to make a long story short I'm a social worker making $35,000 a year now. I'm also married and my husband is a student as well. He's using the GI Bill and has no debt at this point. Combined we bring in $61,000 a year.

I have my Federal loans on the IBR payment plan and have already completed 3 years of payments toward the PSLF program. 

**Now that that's out in the open, here's my dilemma.**

I got accepted into an MSW program that will start in the fall. I will continue to work full time and make payments on my loans throughout the program. I plan to take out federal loans to get my MSW and have two options for my program. I can go full-time and complete it in two years or go part-time and finish in three years.

Originally I planned to go the three year route and maximize my federal loans to make a dent in my private loans as anything federal will be forgiven under PSLF in ten years. Obviously as a social worker, I'll most likely work in non-profits for the next few years. 

Does that make financial sense or should I go the two-year route and focus on finishing faster to bring in a larger salary and? then just aggressively pay down the loans?

Additional important details include:

* My husband will graduate in December 2016 with a degree in exercise science. We'll be moving from Tennessee to Texas when he (fingers crossed) starts Physical Therapy school the following fall. Tuition for that will be covered under the Hazelwood Act.

* Social workers with an MSW have a much higher starting salary base and if I jump ship on the non-profit life, I can expect to make closer to $50,000 a year.

We are different ages but started racing at roughly the same time back in 2005- I have been racing since I was 11 and he has been since he was only five. We are currently sponsorless and strapped for cash running down at our local short track, i44 speedway, which draws a large crowed every Saturday night.

personalfinance,Buying my first car. Am I doing this right?,"So after 31 years of never owning a car and focusing entirely on my debts, I've decided it's time that the freedom is worth the extra few grand or so in interest I'll pay over the life of all the debt I own. I have gone over my financial situation, and here's what I'm seeing:

**Current average monthly spending (4 month average):**

Eating Out: $650

Entertainment/Drinking: $1180

Groceries: $195

Gifts/Sundries/Charity/Health/: $70 

Transportation: $90

Rent/Utilities/Phone/Internet: $1015

Student Loans: $700

**Total**: $3800


**Current monthly net take home:** 

Salary: $5200 (after taxes, SS, health insurance, and defined benefit pension)

Some notes to factor in about current status quo:

* Some items under ""eating out"" I consider hobby expenditures, because they are expensive foodie dining, because I love that. Most could be completely replaced by groceries, but cooking for one hasn't proved to be super cheap given my dietary restrictions.

* Entertainment includes spending on every one of my hobbies, including vacation costs, full-year organization memberships, large purchase music festivals for later in the year, a movie night, etc. It might be slightly overstated due to a heavy March year planning and also a big trip. To give you an idea, my entertainment and drinking spending was between $550 and $700 a month except March, where I pre-bought tickets to a festival, took a vacation, and paid year-long memberships, totalling $1700.

* Student Loans currently $50k federal at 6.8%, set to accellerated pay off in ~7 years. No credit card debt.

*  Income is not actually monthly. I am paid bi-weekly, not bi-monthly, so my usual monthly income is $4450, but I receive a third check every May and October. Total monthly takehome works out ot $5200 over the year.

**Considerations on a car:**

I am interested in getting a car for a few reasons. The first is to be able to get to the grocery store. I don't live in walking distance, and after attempting to use a bicycle last year, I injured myself and have been trying to recover for over a year. I'm now walk-bound only until I find an effective treatment. This has led to a lot more eating out than necessary.


Second, I'd like to be able to vacation in driving distance, rather than take flights. I think it will reduce my vacation expenditures a bit on that front. It should also reduce my existing transportation spending, as that largely includes carsharing services that take the place of personal transportation.


As for the vehicle, I am still considering, but a smallish decent mpg hatchback (for my music hobby) that can handle the Washington mountains (fishing and camping hobby) is ideal. I'm looking at Subarus because they fit this criteria and hold value well in my city. A used one would be between 15,000 and 18,000 depending on mileage, which, at 5% would leave me with the following monthly car cost breakdown:

* Monthly payment on a 4 year loan @5%: $400

* Insurance: $150 

* Gasoline: $100

* Maintenance fund: $50

This leaves me with a net savings of $600/month. In addition, I could pretty easily reduce my eating out in favor of groceries, but unless I cut from the hobby part of that, I won't save a whole lot. Possibly 10%. I can easily cut down the entertainment expenditures.

In terms of emergency funds, I've calculated roughly $2500 in required rent, food, minimum loan payments, and car payments as the lowest I could go, which suggests $7500 as a 3-month emergency fund. I currently have about 8k saved, but the bi-weekly payments messes me up on a monthly expenditure plan. I'd need to maintain a buffer since my bi-monthly salary is $4450, but outgoing expenditures at these levels are $4600. The difference would need to be pre-saved. I also would want to consider my down payment on the vehicle.

Would it be a bad idea to take the loan and invest the $30k instead? 

Nitty gritty:

* I make enough that I can lose the entire investment and still make the loan payments (obviously I would be grumpy about this outcome).
* I'd like some amount of liquidity in my investment.  I normally save $300/mo towards my next car.  The payment would be $531/mo.  I'm thinking I'd draw $231/mo from the investments to keep this rate of saving going (probably in bigger chunks 1-2 times a year to cut down on fees).
* Currently, I'm thinking of investing in two Vanguard ETFs: Vanguard Utilities (VPU) and Vanguard Consumer Staples(VDC).  They seem to give a good return, but are slightly more resilient to down turns in the economy.  I was interested in some bonds to lower risk, but the yields are well under the 2.4% I need to beat.  Also, it seems likely that interest rates will, if anything, rise and lower the value further.  Is there anything else I should consider in addition / instead?

Total for overhead= $1380. This all excludes groceries, lunches, and entertainment which is all ridiculously expensive in NYC. I've pretty much stopped going out. My total CC debt is roughly around $6800 (mostly from college, moving expenses..it's really not important how I got there but I want to get rid of it)

I'm not on the company's health insurance because I'm still covered under my mom's but that will end soon and everyone says our insurance is ridiculously expensive. I'm also not on the 401k because they don't match and I cannot afford it right now.

My plan is to go down there, stay employed for a year for in-state requirements and then apply to the university for my degree.

I currently have a Job and have confirmed with my superiors that I can transfer to the same job at one of their stores in the Houston area.

I calculated that it will cost approximately $10,000 a year to go to school there with books and everything taken into account. 

Living Expenses(monthly): no rent or utilities

                       Hygene $20
                       Laundry $10
                       Drinks $20   
                       Food $90
                       Transportation $160
                       Student Loans $70
                       Play $60
                       Total $430

Income: I currently make 10.33/hr but I will do a conservative estimate of my income assuming that I go back down to base pay 8.00/hr when I transfer to Houston which may or may not be true.

-conservative income $8.00/hr @ 28 hr/wk = ~$850 after tax  
-current income $10.33/hr @ 28 hr/wk = ~$1100 after tax

$850 - $430 = $420
$1100 - $430 = $670

So while living in Houston I estimated I can put $420 in savings per month while meeting all the worst conditions possible such as having to pay my monthly student loans myself without help from parents, having a long commute time, and not getting my current pay.

My current plan is to save up $10,000 before I leave, move down there, work for a year ($5000 more in savings), Get into uni, school and work for a year ($5000 in savings and $10,000 towards school), repeat.

As long as I pass all my classes in my dream major (ezpz) after 1 year I should qualify for the Stanford Student Loan again, but just in case I have enough money at this point to go 2 years of schooling while working and that will definitely be enough time to get my Federal Aid back in order.

Another thing I didn't add was applying for the Federal Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, once I get into uni, simply because I don't know how much they would give and if I am completely eligible.

A last state aid while in Texas I found was the Texas Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which may help in reducing the costs of my food expenses. 

I also am currently registered as a dependent and was wondering if when I start living in my friends parents house if I can register as independent. I'm not well read on this part, currently browsing the internet on it.

Well If anyone actually took the time to read all this I thank you, and I wish to receive any and all advice. Should I save up more money before going? Should I look into any other aid? Am I missing anything?",finance,1400298127

personalfinance,Should I refinance federal student loans with SoFi or play it safe and pay more over time?,"Hey guys,

Just to dive into it -- I have $50k of student debt through Federal direct loans with an interest rate of 6.8%. The monthly min payment for the standard 10 year repayment plan is $720.  My goal is to get out of debt sooner so I pay $1120 each month.

I've been looking for ways to minimize interest incurred through refinancing with alternative lenders. SoFi just approved me for some rates that look much more appealing than what Uncle Sam is giving me.

My question: Should I seize interest savings by refinancing through SoFi at the risk of losing the easy deferral benefits of my federal loans in case I lose work for an excess period of time?

SoFi approved me for the following rates:
*10 year variable rate loan at a starting rate of 3.66%, 3.41% with AutoPay
*05 year fixed rate loan at a rate of 5.625%, 5.375% with AutoPay
*10 year fixed rate loan at a rate of 5.99%, 5.74% with AutoPay

I am seriously considering the variable rate given the speed I'm trying to pay down my debt. But the increased risk if I'm out of work for a prolonged period of time scares me.

Here's my situation:

31 years old, with 50k left in grad school debt @ 6.8%.
Annual income of 110k.
I bank 10% each month to my 401k and max out my Roth IRA every year.
After expenses/deductions I have about 2k left over each month. 40k emergency reserve fund.

The industry I work in is volatile although I've lasted in the company for the last 3 years. I work long hours (70+ a week) but am fine in terms of not burning out.

personalfinance,Chance to recover from huge debt mistakes - need advice on refinancing unsecured debt.,"My wife and I foolishly took on a large amount of unsecured debt during college. Shortly after we both graduated we ignorantly purchased a house at the top of the market. Then our mortgage was purchased by CitiMortgage who proceeded to massively fraud us by only applying 90% of our payments each month for over a year.

The end result of this was all of our unsecured debt went up to 29.9% after they trashed our formerly decent credit record. After I was laid off last summer - amazingly - I was able to refinance much of my unsecured debt to a somewhat more manageable 8%-13%. My wife - however - still being gainfully employed - could not get any of her creditors - and particularly Citibank - to lower her interest rate at all.

I am finally employed again - however we have had zero luck getting her unsecured debt refinanced due to our still trashed credit record. 

She has over $25,000 on credit cards at 29.9% interest and it is killing us. Any advice on which companies are our best chance to refinance this debt to below 10%? I was thinking that getting a year at 0% introductory rate would work well - as we could pay off her debt more rapidly - unfortunately all attempts to secure balance transfer offers from Citibank's competitors have so far failed.

Any advice would be so gratefully appreciated! We are very thrifty and would rather be giving any extra money to our family and charity instead of paying it straight to advance this most fraudulent corporation.",finance,1400340589

personalfinance,Your Social Security and You: Basic Information,"Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), otherwise known colloquially as ""Social Security"" is often ignored and even more often misunderstood in /r/personalfinance.  This post intends to give a basic overview of what Social Security can provide and some possible routes for how to consider it when planning your retirement.

As always, if you see something that isn't correct or have suggestions on other things to add, please let me know in the comments or by private message.

### What is Social Security?

Social Security is the United States' national pension program.  Social Security covers the vast majority of American workers, who pay into the program while employed in exchange for benefits when they become eligible.

Social Security, in most cases, is not a substitute for retirement savings.  It will likely **not** cover all of your expenses in retirement.  It should be considered supplementary to, not a replacement of, your own retirement savings such as [IRAs](http://redd.it/1rworh) and [401k plans](http://redd.it/1p1sj9).

### How is your benefit calculated?

The calculation for an individual's Social Security benefit is complex, but the four main components are:

* The history of your *earnings* for each year you worked and paid into SS.

* Each year of your earnings are indexed to the average national wage.

* The indexed earnings for your 35 highest wage-earning years (including years for which you earned $0) are averaged.

* A set of formulas are applied to ""level out the playing field"" between high earners and low earners.  In other words, those with high incomes receive proportionately less from SS than those with low incomes.

What pops out is your benefit, or **primary insurance amount.** This is the amount you'll be eligible to receive at your full retirement age.  The Social Security Administration makes an annual statement available to you online that details your earnings history and expected benefits.  You have to register for an account with the Social Security Administration [here](http://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/).

### What's my full retirement age?

**Full retirement age** is the age at which you receive your full primary insurance amount.  If you were born after 1960, the age at which you can receive 100% of your primary insurance amount is 67.

### What if I want to start taking benefits early?  What if I want to wait?

The earliest age of eligibility for those with a full retirement age of 67 is 62 years.  The benefit you receive at 62 is 70% of your primary insurance amount, and goes up to 100% on a [monthly basis](http://www.ssa.gov/retirement/1960.html) until full retirement age.  

If you want or can afford to delay your SS benefit, it will increase by 2/3rds of 1% for each month you delay retirement (8% per year) up to age 70.  Past age 70 there is no added value in delaying collecting your benefit.  Thus, if your full retirement age is 67 and you delay collecting benefits until age 70, you'll get 124% of your primary insurance amount.

Clearly delaying retirement as long as possible up to age 70 is to your benefit, all else equal.

### Taxation of Social Security benefits

How your SS benefits are taxed is a mess.  Hopefully you won't think I'm copping out by saying that a full explanation is way beyond the scope of /r/personalfinance, but in short:

* For single taxpayers:  If your adjusted gross income + nontaxable interest + 50% of your SS benefit is between $25 - $34k, 50% of your benefit may be taxable.  If it's greater than $34k, up to 85% may be taxable.

* For joint returns:  If your combined adjusted gross income + nontaxable interest + 50% of your SS benefit is between $32 - $44k, 50% of your benefit may be taxable.  If it's greater than $44k, up to 85% may be taxable.

### I'm a young person.  Will I ever see a cent from Social Security, given how much trouble it's in?

The short answer is *most likely*.  Social Security is too popular to disappear, and for better or for worse it is firmly entrenched in the American political ethos.  That said, SS outlays in recent years have far exceeded taxes.  This could go a couple (or combination) of ways - an increase in the OASDI payroll tax, increased full retirement age, reduced primary insurance amount, more conservative adjustment for inflation, or other options I'm not thinking of at the moment.  Never underestimate the political creativity of legislators to get blood from a stone.  Unless major political change happens, however, everyone covered under SS should expect to receive at least ""something"" (probably around 75%) of their current projected primary insurance amount, made possible solely through tax income.

For a more detailed look at SS's cash flow issues, see the delightfully clumsy-named (PDF) [2013 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2013/tr2013.pdf).

### Spouse benefit

One of the best (frankly, amazing) features of social security is the spouse benefit.  Spouses over age 62 can opt to start collecting their own SS benefit (at the reduced amount) or take the spouse benefit - 50% of the spouses' primary insurance amount - while the other spouse delays their individual benefit.  The Social Security Administration will even tell you which is higher.  The other spouse can then delay their full benefit as long as they like.  To collect spouse benefits the other spouse must be collecting benefits (or ask that they be delayed), and if the spouse takes a reduced benefit the other spouse's full benefit is reduced permanently.

This creates SS strategies in which one earner begins drawing their reduced benefit at age 62 while the spouse waits until age 67 or 70 to start withdrawing theirs.  Depending on incomes and earning history, it may be significantly better for one spouse to wait to collect their benefit.

The spouse benefit is even generous in the event of the death of a spouse.  A widow or widower is eligible to collect a survivor's benefit starting at 60 years of age.  If you or your spouse has already started collecting benefits and one member of the family dies, the survivor continues to receive the larger of their own benefit of your spouse's benefit.

For a more in-depth discussion of spouse and survivor benefits, see [this article](http://moneyover55.about.com/od/socialsecuritybenefits/a/socialsecurityspousebenefit.htm) which has several other links to good information about the matter.

### Asset Allocation considerations

Considering Social Security in one's asset allocation usually falls into one of two camps.

* **It's a bond** - those treating SS payouts as part of their fixed income allocation usually use it as a reason to tilt more towards stocks than they otherwise would for a given age.  

* **It's an annuity** - Since SS benefits can't be rebalanced, manually adjusted, or passed on in an estate, others simply include SS as part of their retirement income and as a way to reduce their drawdown requirements on their other retirement assets.  

Since the future of SS payouts is somewhat uncertain (in terms of the amount, not if it will exist at all), in my opinion younger investors would do well to treat it as an income stream and not in one's current asset allocation.  However, this is highly dependent on one's savings rate at the time of retirement.  If one's ""safe"" investments are enough to live comfortably you may be able to afford increasing your risk level by considering SS as part of your bond allocation.  Alternatively, if you're about to retire and are counting on Social Security to put you over the line between comfortable and scrimping you probably don't want to use it as a justification for increasing risk in your other retirement investments.

### Benefit Collection Strategies

Strategies for collecting benefits are as varied as those who collect them, but here are a few common ones and one that I thought was clever.

* Some start collecting at age 62, no questions asked.  They take the approximately 30% hit on their primary insurance amount.  Starting benefits between age 62 and the full retirement age causes a decreasingly small reduction in benefits depending on when one starts taking them.

* Others wait as long as they can to collect delayed retirement credits.  Delayed retirement credits especially for those that have long life expectancies can make a huge difference.

* There*was* a rule that allows you to collect benefits at age 62 but then reapply for your full primary insurance amount plus delayed retirement credits at an age past your full retirement age, but that changed in 2010.  Now you can only pay back benefits collected within one year of starting them.  [Social Security Timing](https://www.socialsecuritytiming.com/sstiming.cfm?page=advisors&amp;logic=how-to-fix-a-social-security-mistake) offers some remedies for fixing withdrawal mistakes.

### Conclusion

The Social Security program, for all of its faults, is still a great deal.  Everyone that qualifies should be planning to take full advantage of it and its generous features.    

### Further Information

The [Social Security Administration website](http://www.ssa.gov/) is the first stop for most SS issues.  Like most government websites it has its quirks, but most of the explanations are fairly clear.  It also has a [benefits estimator](http://www.ssa.gov/estimator/).

personalfinance,"I'm buried in debt and feel hopeless. Could use some advice (ON, CANADA)","I feel completely hopeless and could use some advice. I work full time and have a decent paying job but it feels like i am never getting anywhere. 

My girlfriend was recently in a very bad accident and cannot work for at least 6 months (well, 6 months from the accident, we are at the 3 month period) I have to cover any food and grocery costs as well as pretty much any small entertainment costs.  My car has kicked the bucket and i don't have any means to fix it which makes getting her to appointments very hard, getting to work hard and daily life away from stores etc. a challenge as well.

It's becoming a sore spot in my relationship with my girlfriend, its causing extreme depression in me. I feel hopeless and i feel like i'm losing out on a fulfilling life. What do i do to fix this, PF?


--First off-- I have a full time job which pays $19/h. My take home is about $1200/bi-weekly. 

My debts are: 
**$586/m for car loan.** I'm upside down and ass backwards in this. I got a terrible, terrible interest rate from the lender and was too stupid to say no to it. I owe $20,000 still on this car (that only cost $26,000 4 years ago) and they refuse to refinance at a lower rate nor will any other bank because my credit is terrible. 

**$400/m for a personal loan** The loan has just over $11K left owing (and will be paid off in about a year at the current payment plan) that I have jointly with my ex-wife. We each pay $400 per month for a total of an $800/m payment. This bank refuses to split it between us, they refuse to refinance and no other bank will lend to me so I can take my half on my own.  The interest rate isn't bad but the payments are way too high and almost unmanageable. 

**$140/m insurance** car and life policy.

**$40/m for credit card** at the above bank. The balance owing is $1220. They have cancelled it because I keep falling behind. I make the payments and they have 0% interest on it for the time being as long as i make payments but i can't pay much more than what i am paying. 

**$0/m on credit card 2**  This one, from another bank, has $3400 owing. I fell very behind and its now in a collections process. i get calls twice a day, every day for this one. they won't settle and refuse anything less then exactly whats owed. This is the most frustrating one. 

**$415/m rent**  I pay half of the rent, my GF pays half. 
**$40/m utilities** again, my gf and i split the cost half and half
**$30/m internet access** same as above, we split the cost
**$65/m phone bill**  my only means of communication for day to day things. 

I cant recall what i spend on grocery items each week but if i had to guess i would say probably **$150** per month.

I just graduated a few weeks ago and have been a long time /r/personalfinance lurker.  I've tried to learn as much as I can before posting, so I'm not asking all the same old questions. 

Background: I'm a 22 year old finance major, who will be starting a rotational program for a large chemical company in mid-July.  The job is 4, 6-month rotations, for a total of a two year contract with the company.  Now onto the good stuff: 


**Income**

* Base Salary: $60,000

* Signing Bonus: $5,000

* Relocation assistance: $XXX


**Expenses**

*Student Loans* 

* $4,000 unsubsidized @ 6.8%

* $2,000 unsubsidized @ 3.8%

* $5,500 subsidized @ 3.8%

* $10,000 subsidized @ 3.4%

(together the rate is 4.2%, and payments won't start for 6 months in November @ $225)

*Overall Estimated Monthly Expenses* 

 * $1,285    (I won't categorize these as they are only estimates to the best of my ability.)






My employer has a 4% 401K match, and after going through student loan exit counseling, I found that after taking out taxes, contribution, and estimated health insurance ($200?), my take home pay will be a little over $3,300.  This leaves me with a little over $2,000 after expense income.  However, this does not include my student loans minimum payment of $225, and for a reason. 

My Plan: Pay off the $4,000 @ 6.8% with my signing bonus (and graduation gifted money).  This should bump down my minimum payment and lower the combined interest rate. All the while also building my emergency fund by setting aside around $1000 each month.  

Now for the questions: 

1. if my expenses are $1,285, after the first month or two of depositing my emergency funds into my savings, where should I put the rest?  I like the idea of placing around 8-12 months in a mutual fund/stock portfolio (while they aren't as safe or liquid, they are unlikely to lose enough value that I don't have at least 4 months worth of savings...Vanguard is my fist thought).  But I'm curious about low risk investments like I-bonds and T-Bills as a tier of savings too. 

2. Being a finance major, I naturally have an interest in managing a smaller active portfolio, something I could risk losing.  Obviously, this isn't my first priority, but I'd like some suggestions on the best place to do this? How much is reasonable to play with, etc.?

3. I know once I pay off the 4k @ 6.8% my remaining loans will be a very low interest rate.  I've seen varying opinions on whether to pay the minimum and invest since it's reasonable to expect over 3.4-3.8% in stocks over a long period. But I see benefits of paying down larger amounts now to invest debt-free in the future.  Any and all opinions on the topic are welcome, especially in relation to my situation and the fact that I'm alright taking on a decent amount of risk! :)

personalfinance,"First time attempting to get a Loan, looking for best practices.","So I would like to apply for a personal or car loan.  I recently went between contracts at my organization, which resulted in a benefits payout.  I got around $5,500 after taxes.  I immediately paid off my debts (student/tuition) and my credit card.  This left me with around $3,500. I currently have $1,500 in my savings; I am putting away $250 per bi-weekly pay period, for around $500 per month or $6,500 per year (26 pay periods per year). 

We had originally been planning a family vacation for the summer, but our car suddenly died and transportation is essential for our work (and honestly for keeping ourselves sane).

I kind of figure at this point I have two options.  Break my bank on my savings and try to get an older car, which comes with a lot of future liabilities or speak with one of my banking institutions and attempt to get a personal or car loan. 

Since I paid off my debts and have been managing my credit card (secured card from BoA) well over the last 11 months, my credit score is at 734.  I think if I held more of a balance on my credit card per month, my score would be even higher, from what I can tell is I am getting knocked for not holding a 20% or less balance/utilization. 

The bank I use for my checking is withdrawing from the region and the only other institution here is a forigen bank, who will probably give me a loan, but not report back to american credit agencies.  I use a credit union for my savings, specifically PenFed.  I had not been using my account much, but recently have been dumping that $250 in it every pay period.

So after the background information I guess my list of questions is this: 

1) Old car or used newer car? (I think used newer car is the obvious answer - unless I cannot get a loan). 
2) Should I seek a loan from PenFed? Should I seek an auto loan or a personal loan? I have nothing to 'secure' the loan with, but what is in my savings account. I am not a member of the armed services, my sister was a former PenFed employee, so I don't know if that impacts my membership rating with them or not. 
3) Should I seek a loan from BoA? And; actually well discussing BoA, my credit card is a secured card, with $400 on it. I am rounding up my 12 months with them, should I attempt to get my money back and ask for a credit line with one of their basic cards? I have made all 11 of my payments on time, my biggest weakness with them (as I mentioned) is my credit utilization. 
4) If getting a loan from either institution is not possible this [article](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/04/30/personal-loans-get-the-money-you-need/) gave me some solid insight on other options. Would anyone mind sharing opinions on peer-investments?

Net Neutrality is only the beginning- as a data service provider, they're strikingly vulnerable to being grouped as an associate to any crime committed over their connections, just as Kim Dotcom was.

DO NOT use a form letter for the 14-28 comments! This will get your comments aggregated and considered a mass email along with everyone else who used that form letter. This makes your comment more or less ineffective! Take two minutes to type out a paragraph. (You're on Reddit right now, so don't tell me you don't have two minutes.) Potential talking points include:
ISPs can charge extra fees to carry traffic from any online business they want. If a company depends heavily on Internet traffic, the ISP could refuse to allow web pages to load in under 30 seconds unless that business pays up. How much? Whatever the ISP thinks it can get you to pay.

Consumers are already paying for Internet access. Online businesses pay their ISPs, just like consumers. Why should the regular people not get the Internet services like email, Facebook, or videos that they've already paid their ISP for? Why should an online business have to pay the customer's ISP, when the customer already paid that bill?
The end result will be either destroying businesses that can't afford to pay up, or higher fees for customers. Some ISPs also own their own online businesses. Those ISPs can charge competitors high enough fees to drive them out of business, so customers only have one option.

Fixing the problem is easy: The FCC reclassifies ISPs as Title II, just like a phone company. If you talk about Verizon on an AT&amp;T phone, they're not allowed to cut off your call, or fill it with static. ISPs shouldn't be allowed to interfere with your Internet either.
Mix it up, add your own views.

Call your Congressperson.[4] Yes, phone call again. Speak slowly and clearly, and keep your talking points simple. You're talking to an intern again. What do you want? Title II for ISPs. Why do you want it? Because as a sysadmin and subject matter expert, you are concerned about what this will mean for the industry, for customers, and for your job and those of others like you in their district.

EDIT: Okay, this blew the heck up a lot more than I expected. Since there's a /r/bestof[5] link now, let's do this right. Get your voice personally heard by doing some of the following!

On the vote to create 'fast lanes' (Where if you're not paying extra to Comcast AND Time Warner AND Charter AND Verizon, you're in the slow lane):

Tom Wheeler (D): YES

Mignon Clyburn (D): YES

Jessica Rosenworcel (D): YES

Ajit Pai (R): NO

Michael O'Rielly (R): NO

Thank Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly for trying to stop the ""slow lanes unless you pay cable ISPs"" concept. Ask Jessica Rosenworcel why, if she had misgivings about the vote moving too fast, she voted for it. Express your displeasure with Tom Wheeler and Mignon Clyburn.

Interestingly enough, the Chairman and Commissioners' direct email addresses have vanished off the FCC website and been replaced by a web form. It's like they don't want people like you to be able to contact the FCC's leadership directly. Pity, that:

Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel: Jessica.Rosenworcel@fcc.gov[8]

Commissioner Ajit Pai: Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov[9]

Commissioner Michael O’Rielly: michael.orielly@fcc.gov[10]

Do not CC: or mass-email them. The government has fairly effective spam filters and you're likely to get your message trapped. Take a moment to write out a few sentences and shoot an email off to each individually.
Their telephone numbers have vanished too. Too bad they're public record:

Write your local newspaper a letter to the editor, call your local television news station and ask them to do a story, especially if you're an actual subject matter expert on networking and the Internet who is good in front of cameras. Consider using those talking points above to illustrate the issue in simple terms. For the generic company referenced, substitute ""If (newspaper/news station) depends heavily on Internet traffic, the ISP could refuse to allow web pages to load in under 30 seconds unless (newspaper/news station) pays up.""

politics,"Dear United States of America, RE: Net Neutrality, I don't think you have what it takes to be a free and democratic society anymore.","You don't even know how to find political candidates at the local and municipal level and communicate with those candidates, or campaign for those candidates.  You are all so inclined to believe that any efforts you put forth won't matter because Comcast and whatever big business can just throw 16 tonnes of money at the problem.  You've already been beaten because you don't even have the will to fight.

I'll admit it, the big ""movement"" of this generation, the Occupy Wallstreet camping fluffy feelgood *protest*, was horribly orchestrated, horribly executed, and a horrible example of what to do.  

Your generation needs a Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece.  You need a politician.  You need to find a candidate, at least one, at every level of your government.  If you can't find one, you can create one.  Honestly, the biggest criticism of this model of politicing is that it ""isn't easy"".  No.  Its not.  Your ""easy"" methods aren't very effective or at least they haven't been in the last 15 years.

People complaining that poor people get the shit end of the stick in terms of politics and how the richest 1% dominates the political scene.  It has to do with organization.  Here is an example of political involvement cross referenced with income stratification : http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/09/01/the-demographics-of-online-and-offline-political-participation/

You need to, especially if you are poor and can not find a job, spend time getting politically involved.  I'm not talking about spending days/months/weeks at the campaign headquarters.  Spend 5 hours this month reading your voters pamphlet for this years elections, take note that its a bit too late this year to find somebody that truly represents you and figure out when and where to vote this year in the mid term.  

5 hours next week figuring out what sort of platform would truly represent your demography.  5 hours the week after that figuring out how that platform can be adapted to fit the local, municipal (county), and state levels.  Now that you have your platforms, spend 5 hours prioritizing them.  (protip, should look something like : jobs, internet, freedom), be ready to run a candidate that agrees with 65% of that platform.  

Now, find a capable and charismatic person to run.  Find more than one?  Run them at different levels of government.  Be ready to compromise on some things.  

Now, you need to get the rest of your friends and family involved and people of your generation.  You know that thing you keep in your pocket?  It has ALL of their telephone numbers in it.  Don't get preachy.  Ask them about their political affiliation.  Respect their opinions, don't argue, but ask them a couple questions about your platform and their thoughts about that and if they'd like a politician to run on that platform or if they have a prepackaged politician in mind ask them to speak with that politician about that platform.  

Be committed to change.  Don't be too committed that you can't change.  What do I mean by that?  The sort of change you are looking for is going to take time.  I don't mean like... its going take years and then happen naturally.  There is a certain threshold for the number of man hours that this is going to take.  If you're pledging 5 hours a week, that is 20 hours a month, and that is 240 hours a year.  If you can get one other people do pledge that amount of time with you, that is 480 hours a year.  Now.  If you get 3 people and they each get two people that is a total of 1920 man hours annually.  

I estimate that it is going to take about 1,900,000,000 man hours to get us close to the point where we need to be (whatever your ideal.  I'm not picky.  But that time has to be spent correctly for optimal results.)  That sounds like a lot?  It is.  But it is achievable.  If you get 2 percent of people under 30 to pledge that 20 hours monthly to the cause that is 235,200,000 annually.  More if you can get more people. 

""But third parties..."".  Nobody mentioned anything about third parties in this discussion of political landscaping.  If you can get 2% of people under 30 to pledge that sort of time to one of the national parties at the local level then you can pretty much dictate what candidate is going to be run during the primaries.  

Think of it like your generation is Odysseus.  Its going to take you 10 years to get home (wherever you want to go).  Now if one of your generation has already done some of the work to organize a political platform that amenable to your generation (here's looking at you Seattle) then you probably already have somewhere you can report for duty.  

I'm not saying its all going to be sunshine and rainbows, but the overarching goals that my generation seems to be very vocal about valuing are achievable, you just have to trek uphill a bit to get there.

Little things like revoking franchise agreements for ISP, telcos, and TV companies that provide them support for a regional monopoly.  Little things like banning ISPs that are not classified as Title II Common Carriers at the state level.  Once you have the base, for the local, municipal, and state levels taken care of then you can essentially make the federal level your bitch.  

So yea.  I don't think my generation (ages 18-30) has the wherewithal to create a political apparatus, to perform that sort of political landscaping, or to get anything done politically.  Its not a factor of money, its a matter of boots on the ground.",finance,1400367101

personalfinance,Refinancing ParentPlus Loans,"Hi all, I graduated from a public university in Texas in May 2012. My mother took out ParentPlus loans throughout college for me totaling around $110,000 with a weighted interested rate at 7.8% at the time of graduation. Since then, I have been making all of the payments that are about $1100/mo for a 10yr repayment plan. I'm hoping to refinance this loan (I've already consolidated it) for a lower interest rate. 
The issue is my mother has terrible credit. I know I can't transfer a ParentPlus loan into my name (as the student). Is it possible to refinance and cosign with her? I know cosigning makes me legally liable for the repayment of the loan, but I'm already the one paying it and I earn an annual income that allows me to make these hefty payments.

And finally, just a little about how we got where we are,

from Politifact:

&gt;**Since his first run for office, net neutrality -- the idea that all Internet traffic should be treated equally -- has been important to President Barack Obama.**


&gt;In December 2010, Obama backed the FCC's decision to implement pro-neutrality regulations. Those regulations banned providers from blocking sites and required them to establish transparent policies.

&gt;**Once that happened, we moved this to a Promise Kept.**

&gt; [Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski cheered consumer advocates — and worried Internet service providers — on Sept. 21, 2009, when he announced that his agency would seek to establish new rules on ""Net neutrality,"" the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally.](http://www.pcworld.com/article/172312/fcc_chairman_calls_for_formal_net_neutrality_rules.html)


&gt;*But in January 2014, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled those regulations illegal, siding with Verizon following a lengthy battle.*

personalfinance,21 year old with some debt. Can I consolidate?,"Here's my situation: I'm a 21 year old college student making about $1400 a month after taxes.

personalfinance,25 year old with a LOT of student loans.,"I finished pharmacy school last May and have been working for a retail chain since shortly before graduation.  Having no money before starting school, every dime of tuition and living expenses for the 6-year degree came from loans.  A rough estimate is about $230,000.
I earn $117,000 annually.  The bulk of these are federal loans, which are mostly at 6.8%.  Rates range from 5.0% (very few) to 7.9% (about $40,000 worth).
I've been putting about $2,500 per month toward the loans, with the excess above the minimum (~$1,850 per month) being added to the 7.9% loans first.
My employer matches 401k contributions 100% up to 5% of income.  I'm currently investing just 5% of my income to the 401k to get the match.  401k investments are about 70% aggressive, 20% moderate and 10% conservative.
I have been (and continue to be) approached by multiple financial advisors.  Other pharmacy graduates repeatedly tell me ""a good advisor is a must!"" - and I had one for a while, but he's left his company so I'm getting ready to bail on his plan for me, which was to sell me insurance.  

Thanks for reading this far.  Now some questions.
IS a financial advisor a must for someone in my situation, as other graduates say?  FAQ says not likely, and my gut tells me my current path is pretty straightforward: pay off loans ASAP, starting with highest rates.
Is any sort of debt consolidation a feasible option for federal loans?  I have heard they are significantly harder to reduce via methods that private loans would have, but I am clueless as to what any of these mechanisms may be anyway.
Do I need to be looking into other investment vehicles at this time, considering my current loan burden and that I'm not maxing out my 401k?  Should I be maxing my 401k contributions if it's at the expense of putting extra money into loan repayment?
Are there any other key financial aspects I'm missing altogether?

* Take home pay: No idea. I’m actively looking for a paid finance internship downtown. I’ll also be an RA which pays something like $125 a month
* Required spend: No idea. My mom is making more money this year which could drastically change my financial aid, meaning I may have to take out much more in loans. I don’t find out until June. Housing will be completely free since I will be an RA. Other expenses such as food, textbooks, and other academic fees will probably total $3,500 for the year

After I graduate, hopefully I can get a high-paying job that will allow me to pay off my loans quickly. (fingers crossed!) 

Any tips, suggestions or advice? I'd really just like any help that I could get in fixing my expenditures, as well as making my budget look less crazy.

personalfinance,Invest in 401k or pay off student loans faster?,"Hello,

**I am 24 and have 83k** :( in student loan debt (55k private and 28k federal). I recently refinanced my private loan from 9.5% with wells fargo to 5.64% with a credit union. The federal loans range from 3.64 to 6.8%. ~15k of 28k is at 6 or 6.8.

**My work has a 401k** that I've been depositing 5% into for the past year of working, which is roughly $120/paycheck. However my company doesn't do a matching system, but deposits X amount into our 401ks at the end of the year based on a few variables like company performance, salary, etc.

**Would it be smarter** to change my contribution to 0% and instead put that money towards paying down my student loans?

**Secondary question**, if I didn't have my student loans, is it worth depositing into the 401k if the company doesn't match? Even though it would be post-tax?

Would my general best plan be paying down the federal loans at &gt;6% first and throwing any extra I have into them that I've been previously putting into the 401k?",finance,1400397558
personalfinance,Company ending 401K. Withdraw or Rollover?,"I'm 24 years old and I've been in the workforce for less than a year and my company is splitting into two companies. As a result, our 401K plans are being closed and we can not roll money over into our new plans. I currently have less than $5,000 (actual amount is $4,200) in my account and have only two options...

1. Rollover the account in to an IRA.
2. Withdraw the money according to the rules of the plan. Any non-vested funds become 100% vested.

I've been changing my spending habits but still have about $2200 in credit card debt at an interest rate of 19.97% and no sort of emergency savings fund. 

I feel like if I get that debt off of my shoulders, I can save more money for an emergency fund and contribute additional money to the new 401k plan. But, I also hate to lose a chunk of the money to penalties and taxes.

personalfinance,Consolidating federal student loans?,"I have ~30k of federal student loans, stafford unsubsidized and subsidized in repayment. The 30k is made up of 9 separate loans ranging from 3.64 to 6.8% interest rates.

I've been trying to do some research but I don't fully understand how federal consolidation works. According to the direct loan consolidation website your new interest rate is just a weighted average of all the loan balances and interest rates you are consolidating.

So wouldn't you be paying the same amount of interest after consolidation? I don't see the benefit, other than not having to worry about paying proportionally to the 9 loans based on the high interest rates? Is there no way to lower the 6.8% interest rates?

&gt; This post was originally intended to be against russians, but as I wrote it, it evolved to this. Enjoy.

super-ultra-pro-tip: Especially in tiers bellow nova, Learn english before trying to play matchmaking. One of the 2 reasons I'm stuck in silver hell is because the random teams never talk, and the other is because of the skill gap I have transitioning from cod. While my aim has Improved a lot since I started, teams haven't. And that's why I think matchmaking is bad. Higher tier people will play with other good players, in turn getting better, while on silver, people won't improve because they don't know what they're doing wrong.

A good way to fix matchmaking for everyone, including the join times of global elites, would be a better rating system. For example, every player is rated from 0 to 2000 and every mm team needs to have a sum of 6000 out of the 10000 possible. That way, silvers would get to see some good players and try to be like them, while the high tiers would find games to join faster. This seems to be ignored a lot lately in video games, favoring the winner.

Take mw2 -a fun game imo- what went wrong with it? Noobtubes and killstreaks. Noobtubes are self explanatory but killstreaks? why? Because of the way they worked. The better players would be the first ones to reach them which in turn gave them more kills just to stomp on everyone else. The game would end with the /ok players being destroyed and the above average ones going higher and higher.

The skill gap that makes csgo threatening to newcomers would disappear, If you volvo people would fix matchmaking. And add fedoras.",technology,1400415026

tech,Municipal Fiber template to present to your city hall!,"I really enjoyed the discussion in yesterday's Municipal Fiber post. I decided to take some of the input from the community and make a rough draft of a speech you can bring to your local city board during a town meeting.

This is about a 5 minute speech, which is the allotted time for speaking in my city.  

&amp;nbsp;
       
Any constructive input is welcomed and feel free to take and edit it as you see fit! This is just a rough draft.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit: Substantial changes, formatting, and real numbers.**

&amp;nbsp;
    
----------------
  
     
Hello, my name is [TDmorty] .  I briefly corresponded via email last week with Mayor [Mayor], but I believe it will be beneficial for me to speak to the rest of the council as well.  I’d like to talk to you today about organizing and implementing a Municipal Fiber Optic network with symmetrical Gigabit internet for the city of [city] and surrounding township, and to discuss the economical, medical, and educational benefits to the community if we were to run a FTTH (Fiber to the Home) network.

&amp;nbsp;

You should all have received an email from me regarding the technical benefits of fiber over the current copper and coaxial networks, as well as a very detailed report on the success of three specific Municipal Broadband projects.  Those are EPB in Chattanooga Tennessee, OptiNet in Bristol Virginia, and (LUS Lafayette Louisiana. The numbers I will be referencing are located within the ""Broadband at the Speed of Light"" pdf document.

&amp;nbsp;

Gigabit speeds will put Lowell on the national map a technology hotspot.  We will attract numerous Information Technology related entrepreneurs, established software companies, and many other business that see the value in utilizing high bandwidth access to enter the growing digital marketplace.  OptiNet, The Fiber network in located in Bristol Virginia, reports that it gained the city over 50 million dollars in new private investments, and generate over 2,000 good paying jobs and greater than 37 million dollars in annual payrolls. The influx of high skilled workers with more disposable income would no doubt benefit our local business.

&amp;nbsp;


In Chattanooga Tennessee, the Electric Power Board also saw the benefits of utilizing fiber in their city.  They installed nearly 170,000 smart power meters that update the Power Board of their status to every 15 minutes.  There is also 1,500 smart switches that are able to route energy around the grid during emergency that, thanks to fibers speeds, are able to be activated moments notice.  The smart grid cut power outages by 40% and is estimated to generate $300 million of economic benefit to the community over 10 years.   
  

&amp;nbsp;

The FCC recently released a study stating that “students that have Broadband in the home have a 7% higher graduation rate” than those who lack access to high speed internet.  They study more, watch TV less, and have better grades. For parents that want to homeschool their children, or for students with learning disability or that are developmentally challenged, Remote or Networked learning becomes a very real and viable option.  Personalized lesson plans from an education specialist can be streamed right to the home. Online courses for adults become more commonplace, strengthening the current workforce.  

&amp;nbsp;

 
Public power agencies are a common vehicle for community broadband investments for many reasons, but a big one is financing. Investors trust public power companies to repay their debt and are familiar with revenue bonds issued by public utilities. Bristol, Lafayette, and Chattanooga all issued revenue bonds secured by utility assets for substantial portions of their fiber network investments as well as federal development grants and inter-division loans.

&amp;nbsp;

Currently there is no competition driving telecommunication companies to deliver faster speeds.  They split up the land make local monopolies, they charge more every year for slow speeds and they refuse to upgrade infrastructure unless it’s a last resort.  The internet backbone was built with taxpayer dollars.  The companies were given over 200 billion from the government in order to upgrade their networks and bring symmetrical Broadband to every home in the country.  They intentionally sank the 51 proposed projects and pocketed the money.  There’s a link on the bottom of my handout with a link to that story.  Another recent FCC study shows how telecom prices have been raising over triple the rate of inflation.  There is a link for that too. 

&amp;nbsp;

Telecommunications companies only interest is short term profit, which makes sense, they are companies and not utilities.  But would you let the wellbeing of the electric lines be left up to private, profit driven companies? What about sewage lines? Water? The Highways?  Gas? A Municipal Fiber Network will focus on the long term economic health of our community and treat broadband as the utility it is, not as immediate profit but as a long term community investment.  

&amp;nbsp;

Technology, specifically computing, is an exponentially growing field.  High networking speed and bandwidth drives innovation.  15 years ago when Dial-Up was mainstream and ADSL was gaining traction, nobody imagined streaming services like Sykpe and Netflix to be as large as they are now.  There no telling what fantastic new services and technologies will utilize the Fiber networks, but everyone in the tech industry will tell you that Gigabit internet is the future.  It will make communities stronger.  Fiber Networks are a necessary investment to keep our businesses and local economy competitive and to guarantee or children have a head start in tomorrow’s tech driven world.

**Question:**  ~~Should the 675 be put towards the CC or towards tuition?  It’d be a Stafford Plus Direct Loan.  I don’t believe I’d be paying interest on those but a 12% effective interest rate + it being a Federal Loan makes it NOT bankruptcy-friendly (I don’t plan on going into Bankruptcy … but thinking ahead here just in case?).  To me it appears it’d be better to make sure I take as few StaffordDirectLoans as possible.

The CC debts would be paid off slowly within 4 years (as a worst case scenario).~~

- debt: 182k€ mortgage, 5.4% interest, interest deductible from income tax

- equity: my house would sell ~180k€ in the current housing market

- fixed expenses: 22.5k€ / year:

  - 11k€ mortgage (incl mortgage interest payments + deposits guarantee fund + mandatory loan insurance)

  - 2.7k€ housing (energy + housing taxes + heating etc)

  - 2k€ insurance (health + travel + liability + housing)

  - 1.3k€ travel (train + car share + bike maintenance)

  - 5.5k€ food + basic living

- current savings:

  - 8k€ ""bankspaar"" = mortage guarantee fund, interest rate pegged to mortgage at 5.4%, tax-free, required by bank to grow to 80k€ in 25 years, insured

  - 9k€ emergency fund (1.5% interest savings account, insured)

  - 5.2k€ in low-risk local investment funds (water works + green energy), avg 7% yield / year over last 5 years

- planned discretionary expenses (budgeted): ~4.1k€ in 2014, could reduced to ~3k€ temporarily (6-12 months) by giving up on some projects

- unplanned discretionary expenses: ~2k€ in 2013-2014, still keeping an eye on that one

- remains unallocated: ~3.5k€ / year, currently pushed towards my emergency fund (1.1k€) and investment funds (2.4k€).

My goals: A) I want to soon transition away from full-time employment with 1 employer to part-time employment with 2 or more employers (incl. possibly consulting), if possible with more discretionary spending. I expect that my gross income as ""flex worker"" will be equal or higher than what I currently get. B) over ~5 years, either remodel my current house or move into a larger house.

My questions:

1. should I sell my house now, before I enter a new ""flex worker"" situation? 

2. if I keep the house, should I allocate my unallocated income towards reducing my debt, instead of an investment fund? (on the one hand, keeping my debt high allows me to deduct more taxes from my income; however I would get less taxes back if I have another job (or jobs) with less income)

3. should I refinance my mortgage? If so, what should I care about in a new loan?

4. are there some other financial moves I could make to increase my work flexibility without increasing risk too much?

My (perceived) obstacles: I believe that 1) without stable employment, banks will make it more difficult for me to loan/refinance in an advantageous way 2) multiple part-time positions imply my income will be irregular so mortgage payments may be more difficult to organize 3) as flex worker I would need to start caring about retirement funds, which so far have been paid entirely by my past employers, and I have no clue where to start.
If you have any suggestions as to how to alleviate these obstacles, I am interested!",finance,1400456461
personalfinance,Paying extra towards loans with higher interest when on an IRB plan?,"This may have been answered already, but I couldn't find it specifically. My question for you guys is this: If I am financially able to pay extra towards what I owe on a loan will they boot me from the IRB plan? For example I have seven loans serviced by Nelnet three of which have an interest rate of 6.8% and the rest are 2.35%. I currently qualify for IRB and my payments will be approximately $90. If I specify that I would like an extra $45 applied towards the principle of the higher interest loans they're going to just laugh and bump me to the standard payment plan aren't they? 

Edit: I also have a car payment that is 4.9% and I could possibly double up on those payments specifying that the extra payment goes to principle instead and knock the payoff down from 3.4 to 1.9 years. Then afterwards throw that extra money towards my loans. Would that be the better route?",finance,1400460726

personalfinance,Cosigning a mortgage refinance with GF's mother,"I have been with my girlfriend for 8+ years and we have a great stable relationship. Her mother owns a house and is struggling to make payments on her mortgage. After speaking with realtors/looking at recent sales prices of houses around her neighborhood, she figures she can sell her house and come up on top with ~$150k after paying off what she owes on the house. She would like to use that money and buy a smaller / less expensive townhouse that she can afford. The issue is that she does not have good enough credit to take out a mortgage to buy this less expensive house. She recently approached me to ask if I can help cosign a mortgage with her to buy the townhouse and that she will be the only one paying for the townhouse. Considering all the pitfalls of this ie. What if she loses her job, what if I lose my job, I ultimately do not want to be responsible for a townhouse, etc. we ended the discussion about cosign for a townhouse. 

Another option that came up, was to cosign to refinance the mortgage for her house. I have the same concerns about cosigning with her above, but her house is in a nice neighborhood and is not underwater so it seems like this is a less risky proposition. Again, she will be the only one paying the mortgage. She has a stable job that she has worked at the same company for the last ~15 years. She is going to ask her lender after this weekend about how much lower her interest rates will be if I cosign a refinance mortgage with her. 

I know next to nothing about mortgages. Going off of google, I have the following concerns that PF might be able to answer.
1. I am currently building up my savings to put a down payment to buy a house in ~3-4 years. Being that I will be a first time house owner, how will having me cosign a mortgage affect my first time home owner tax credit? Will I lose that tax credit if I cosign with her?

2. How will having a mortgage affect my chances of securing my own mortgage when I first buy a house? Will having this high debt (this mortgage) to income ration will hurt my chances? I currently have 0 debt, but I don't a credit history of large purchases. I always purchased my vehicles/big dollar items in cash, but for almost everything else, I use my credit card.

3. I don't want to be on the hook on a 30 year or however long mortgage, but I do feel less apprehensive about it since it is tied to a house in a very desirable and expensive city. How concern should I be about this?

4. PF, is there anything else that I should consider. I'm basically flying blind.

personalfinance,Helping my dad with some financial stuff and had a few questions for you fine folks!,"My dad currently makes about 160k before taxes, but due to gross mismanagement, a divorce and four children pays out most of his income to loans. He has about 13k worth of credit card debt with around a 10% interest rate.

I recommended he check out a consolidation loan as an alternative to the high percentage on the credit card. My question is if a consolidation loan would lower his credit score or affect his chances at being a cosigner for a college loan? My second question is if there are any good sites where people can recommend good financial planners in the area. He is looking for someone not to invest, but to see if they can straighten up what he is paying out. Thanks in advance! Sorry for the lengthy paragraph.",finance,1400463684

personalfinance,"[US] Wife leaving employer, what to do with 401k/profit sharing account","Background info: My wife and I are both 28, we have a fair amount of debt we are trying to get on top of eventually.  I have student loans (I don't make enough to even look at these a the moment), some older credit card debt (around 4k), some medical debt (honestly don't remember how much, 1 or 2k for an ER visit from a blood clot she got form an IV they gave her on a previous visit, yay, it was from last year when our deductible was still ""why even bother having insurance"" sized), and we have a mortage / house we had to basically abandon (had a good job, got laid off, couldnt find a job, had to move to find a job, bank wouldn't approve any refinancing, mortgage got traded between three different companies restarting the process, etc.  Not really the point of this post)  We also live in Florida, so state income tax wouldn't be an issue.

So my wife currently works at Walgreens but will be leaving to go to community college to change careers after the 31st of this month.  She has had a Profit Sharing (401k) account for the last five or so years she has been with the company.  She has a second job now which will be her main source of income after she leaves Walgreens.

Right now we basically live paycheck to paycheck comfortably, with some discretionary money left for fun without it cutting into our bills.  But I would like to get us out of that cycle for once.  After the 31st, she should be eligible to receive the balance of her 401k as a lump sum.  The account has a vested balance of $13,487 right now.

I'd like to move most of this (our car is about on its last leg, so some would probably go to something that isn't nearly 20 years old) to an emergency / bill fund that we can have all of our rent / utilities auto-draft from, and we pay into each month.  She banks at Wells-Fargo and I bank with Partners Federal Credit Union (Disney Employee FCU).  That would kind of ease the pressure on our required monthly expenses, give us a buffer, and let us focus more on taking care of previous debt.

I'm unsure about what kind of tax penalties we would get for this, or if there would be a particular kind of savings/checking account that would be preferred for this, or if it would be a smart thing to do.  I know a retirement fund is important, but would this be a better option for us right now?",finance,1400477774

WARNING: This will be a long, “all about me” post, I am sorry. Thank you to all of the kind folks out there that contribute to this sub, one day I hope to be as wise as you! Anyway, this is where I am at right now:

## Income:

My boyfriend and I take home $4,720 each month. This is after taxes, my health insurance, and my 401(k). He isn’t currently contributing to his 401(k) because his company doesn’t offer a match until after one year of service (Feb. ‘15). Also, he is on his parents insurance.

## Expenses:

* Rent - $1,300  
* Utilities - $175  
* Car Insurance - $95  
* Gas - $400  
* Groceries - $400  

## Savings:

I have automatic savings transfers set up for $780 a month. I put 5% into my 401(k) in order to take full advantage of a 3% match.

## Debts:

I pay $140 a month towards an interest free loan for a professional review course (CPA).
**We have $75,000 of debt** from college/graduate school loans ranging from 3%-8% APR. We currently try to put $1,000 a month towards our loans focusing the one with the highest interest rate first and so on.

## Assets:

We both own our cars outright. Our “emergency fund” of sorts, or just our savings accounts are about $2,000 so far. My 401(k) is up to $2,000 as well.

### The Problem:

I find that I am constantly planning for future scenarios, but never get very far because I can’t rein in my spending or I try to fix everything at once. **I use Mint.com** to track everything but it seems like it’s just a neat tool to watch me blow my budget each month. My goals are all over the place: *I want to save but I want to pay down my debt; I want to save for retirement but I want to furnish my apartment*. I really want to take the Financial Peace University course this year (there isn’t one being offered right now in my area) so that I can hopefully hone in on a good course of action. Anyway, I would really appreciate any guidance from those of you who have seen the other side. Thanks so much!",finance,1400515803

Bitcoin,My worry with bitcoin as a network engineer,"First off, I'd like to say I'm Pro-bitcoin. I've been mining since 2013 with around 230GH/s and I have a few bitcoins in an offline wallet. I've been telling everyone about it, wearing Bitcoin shirts to start conversations etc etc so, please don't yell at me and call me a bitcoin-hating troll for bringing this up. K? Ok. 


Here is my fear for the future of crypto-currency; Yes, it's a bit nightmarish but hey, we have to watch out for Murphy right?

Lets say it's 2025. IPv6 has taken over everything. As you know I'm sure, IPv6 gets rid of NATs (mostly) since there are so many addresses, something like: 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 unique addresses and as we know Cisco is trying to [IP EVERYTHING!](http://www.cisco.com/web/solutions/trends/iot/overview.html) From Trees in the forest to your boxer-briefs and there is  enough IP space to do it. 

Then comes [I2RS](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/i2rs/charter/) and [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locator/Identifier_Separation_Protocol). I2RS is an SDN type protocol which allows applications (nsa?!?!) to basically manipulate the routing table and the forwarding table w/o anyone. Right now, if you wan to black hole a route or something you, a human, has to manually login to the router, and start typing shit. soon, some third party software will be able to manipulate the routing/forwarding table on the fly.  and LISP (not the programing language) is a technology that will allow you to take your IP address everywhere with you. As I'm sure you know, right now if you go to starbucks and get on the internet your public address is a NAT/PAT address that is owned by some provider and it's designated for that store or something like that. When you go home, you get a different public address and if you go to your buddies house and get on the tubes, well, then you get different public address etc etc.  With LISP, you will be able to take your IP with you (sorta) That means one public IP can be assigned to you and you only and you will use it no matter if you're in Seattle or Tajikistan! 

Here is the scary part!
It's 2025. IPv6, LISP, I2RS, Bitcoin has taken over the intertubes. Bitcoin is now mainstream and the only people who use cash are the people who still have a flip phone. Then ""we"" ""elect"" a Rick Perry or a Dick Cheney type character and they pass laws! Bunch of laws thanks to some fucked up event! 

Everyone MUST register the public Key with the FED (HAHAHAHAHAH, oh the irony) and any transactions placed with an unregistered Public Key is now considered a crime.  One man , one SSN, one Public Key, one IPv6 Address! Totalitarianism wet dream! They will be able to track everything we buy and sell and I'm sure they are exempt, just like how congress is able to do insider trading with immunity. 

Anyway, hope i'm wrong. Please knock some sense into me.

Economics,Announcing the Provision of RSS feeds into /r/economics.,"Dear Readers, 

In order to better live up to /r/economic's mission statement of providing a forum for the debate of news and research regarding the science of economics, we have been tinkering with the automatic delivery of economic news and research via RSS feed. 

To that end, we've launched two bots a few days ago. /u/shares_RSS, is an RSS-fed bot who provides an economic newswire from reuters and fivethirtyeight. /u/central_bank_bot.will furnish working papers from the NBER, CEPS (a European commission think tank), as well as numerous central banks. At the moment, only his central bank feeds from the Bank of Canada and the National Bank of Belgium are activated. This is primarily because /u/central_bank_bot recieved numerous feedback asking us to post abstracts rather than PDFs. We're working on it. 

In order to make sure that we get good content, I've been in direct personal contact with the press offices of the Bank of England, and of the German Bundesbank, the latter of whom has promised us to launch their RSS feed in the next few days. 

We delayed making this public announcement for a few days, until such time as the bots we actually operational, lest we end up making promises about content that we couldn't deliver upon. Indeed the two bots had a rather buggy start-off. 

Thus far, we see that the Reuters news and the Fivethirtyeight's economic analysis has provoked lively debate on the relevant policy issues within /r/economics (which is what we wanted). 

So, without further ado, I would like to open the floor for comments. concerns, and questions about how we may better deliver relevant and discussion-provoking economic content. We are open to suggestions about how we can make /r/economics relevant and informative for those interested in the dismal science.  

Yours sincerely

personalfinance,Advice on paying off a car with cash,"I've been saving for the past 3 or so years for a new car as my current one is about to die. I've worked out the exact OTD price (26k) with the dealer, but people are telling me that I should take an auto loan with minimal downpayment and invest what I have. That the returns I'll make will be greater than the interest rate on the loan. However, the way I see it is different.

I'm 23 with minimal credit history. I paid off all my student loans before the grace period was over and I've had a credit card for about 1.5 years now. So I can't imagine my score being decent enough to get a low rate. But let's say I get my parents to cosign the loan so the rate would be what? Roughly 3.5%? The cash on hand would have to go into a taxable account (IRA already maxed) into most likely the 2055 Vanguard TDF. So that's any applicable commission &amp; trading fees on taxed income off the bat. Then there's the fee for getting it out plus any capital gains and expenses on that. These costs go on top of the loan's interest rate and gap insurance I'd need to purchase as well. Plus that's all not counting the fact that I'm betting that there won't be another bear market soon. But I don't think having a bear market would matter for the money invested since I won't take it out until retirement. I'd still have to make those monthly payments anyways.

Plus, these are people who say that I could also take out an auto loan and make the minimum payment for anywhere from 1 month to 1 year. Then pay the rest of the loan off to build credit. The same people who believe that I should keep a balance on my credit cards to generate credit b/c by paying off my balance at the end of the month each time, I'm not building much credit. It's because these people believe in something like that leads me to believe that they are all misinformed and that I should just pay the car in cash.",finance,1400524114

personalfinance,"Buying used car, cash or finance?","Greetings PF - 

For the past year I've been living without a car for the first time in my life and relying on public transportation / zip car. I've been able to seriously dig in to my student loans and save a good amount of money. However, I'm really starting to want a car again. The convenience factor is huge and I feel bad having my friends cart me around all the time even if I don't ask. 

My questions are:

* Should I put in a nice down payment and finance at a low % , Chase gave me ballpark of 2-3%. Or should I save up more money and just pay cash?

* Is there an advantage to the dealership if I come in with cash vs financing? AKA will I have more leverage to negotiate a better price if I do it that way?

* What price range should I be targeting / can I afford? I want something relatively newer so that it will last me a long time and I'd like a fuel efficient car. 

**info**

* 26, single, no kids
* income - $60-70K (commission based so it varies, base is 45) Average monthly net is $3500

This seems basic but I don't know nearly as much about taxes as I should and I can't find my answer directly(probably because it is basic).

I was with a friend and we were talking about his new car - he recently started a 2 year lease on a Leaf. I was asking about the costs since I know nothing about leases or electric cars and he explained that it's pretty cheap because Georgia has one of the larger tax credits in addition to the gas savings he gets. 

I looked into it and found that there is a $7500 federal tax credit and that Georgia has a $5000 tax credit. I have no idea what this means though in regards to a 2 year lease. One website said something about the $7500 going to the dealer and that they may pass that on to the buyer. I am thoroughly confused about who gets what, and whether is is a tax deduction or a straight up credit.

I'm not too keen on the inner workings of political politics (heh), although in this particular case I'd be lying if I didn't say that people are generally fed up with the popular 3-party system that plagues our politics here in Canada. Like any modern day democracy, representation from smaller parties (although with very relevant political platforms) seems to sort of fall on the sidelines.

In this particular case, the Ontario Green Party (once again) has not received an official invite to the upcoming televised debate likely scheduled for June 3, 2014. The Green Party has a platform that combines ideas from both the left and the right, but is fundamentally interested in sustainable development and clean energy. I believe this is the right direction we should be going with politics, but I am no partisan! 

Like Bitcoin, Dogecoin isn't a nod at current financial system, rather, a gesture of public discontent and a lack of trust in our current established economic and political landscape. 

Can /r/dogecoin, the community who has been able to fund multiple charitable causes and even put an internet meme on a NASCAR, be able to put Mike Schreiner in the official debates?

Bitcoin,"Here is the entire letter from Brock Pierce that the WSJ referenced earlier today. (FWIW, I believe him.)","It was great to see some of you during the Bitcoin2014 conference. Because of the press coverage and Bitcoin Foundation member response to my election, I wanted to take the opportunity to make you all aware of the facts about my background. 

Approximately 14 years ago, I was falsely accused of sexual assault in civil lawsuits filed against multiple defendants in California by a man named Mike Egan and some of his friends. They apparently saw an opportunity to extort money from several entrepreneurs, including me. I was never served with the lawsuits and didn’t even know they existed. When I later became aware, I immediately went to court in California and aggressively cleared my name. Each of the lawsuits was dismissed by the Courts with the full consent of Mr. Egan and the other plaintiffs, none of whom seemed eager to further perjure themselves in open court in the face of someone standing up to them. 

These civil actions arose from my association, at the age of 17, with a tech startup called Digital Entertainment Network, which was founded by a man who was later charged with certain federal offenses that dated back to many years before I joined the company.

Let me emphasize this: Despite a full investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office, the FBI and the State of California into the allegations, I was never charged with anything whatsoever by anyone and was cleared of any wrongdoing.

The only reason my name has surfaced again in this context is because the same man who convinced his friends that they might be able to extort money from me back then is now trying the same thing against Director Bryan Singer, on the eve of the debut of “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” and three other successful Hollywood figures. This lawsuit has nothing to do with me. I am not a defendant.

The sad truth is that Mike Egan’s family appears to have a history of abusing the legal system to try to advance its financial interests, even bringing suits against family members. And, according to recent articles in Buzzfeed, The Wrap and The Hollywood Reporter, Egan and his mother already have been caught in lies that are likely to unravel the pending cases against Mr. Singer and the others.   

Bitcoin is controversial in some quarters. That’s why I believe we need people on the board who are not afraid of being publicly attacked and who have no skeletons in their closets. I have been subjected to continuous public scrutiny since my childhood. I have nothing to hide and nothing to fear.

Ironically, I have put my heart, my time and my effort into saving MtGox and becoming a member of the Foundation Board in an effort to help bitcoin project an image of integrity and to allow those who wish to participate in the Bitcoin ecosystem to do so without fear of losing their investment. In fact, I ran for election in response to the tarnish that came as a result of MtGox’s failure.

It’s absurd for the press and some members of the Foundation to try to put me in the same category as board members who, in one case, lost hundreds of millions of dollars of the very currency we want to thrive, and in the second case, has been charged with aiding and abetting money laundering.  

I am sorry that 10 of 1,500 members chose to resign, but I am at a loss to explain why they would do so now and not after Mr. Karpeles allowed MtGox to implode or Mr. Shrem was indicted. I am saddened and angered by this.

Yet stepping down from the board in response to hateful and uninformed chatter on bitcoin forums or because of these resignations is not rational, prudent or warranted. It would set a bad precedent for the Foundation, rewarding those who make scurrilous accusations and engage in character assassination, often anonymously. 

A resignation also could be perceived as an admission of guilt and I am guilty of nothing and have never been convicted, or even charged, with a crime. 

A resignation could impair efforts by my partners and me to rehabilitate MtGox and prove that the industry is self-healing and needs no government regulation.  Our intentions are to fully compensate customers who lost money, helping to restore faith in bitcoin. We are eager to expand participation in the market once we launch a new exchange. It would be a shame if the 127,000 MtGox creditors and the rest of the community were to suffer a setback because of this rumor-mongering.   

I might also add that some of the individuals inciting this vitriol have a motive: They want to torpedo the Gox transaction because they oppose rehabilitation efforts or they are mounting their own plan. 

I have been duly elected. If anyone on the Foundation board has recently been subjected to community approval, it is Bobby Lee and me. 

I have devoted most of my adult life to pioneering, building and believing in digital currencies. Over the last decade and a half, I have built many successful businesses, many of them based on digital currencies. I have raised millions of dollars from investors, many of whom have invested with me multiple times. I have supported the community passionately and steadfastly. 

During this time, I have been vetted by some of the most scrupulous investors, including Goldman Sachs, Oak Investment Partners, Clearstone Partners, Intel Capital, and dozens of other major individuals and institutions. No investor to my knowledge has ever refused to invest in me because of my background. 

I hope this helps clarify the situation and I thank you for your support. 

Sincerely,
Brock Pierce",cryptocurrency,1400534808

Basically guys. What I'm looking for is some advice on what to do. This is by far the most stable I've been financially and I don't want to fuck up. I have a large amount of school debt that I pay off incrementally every month. I am often really torn on dropping all my stock and clearing out that school debt VS buying a home, putting 20% down and hoping the tax savings on my income PLUS future stock coming down the road will clear out my debt just if not faster.  

Reasons I want to buy:  
I've been renting for 4 years in the bay area. As anyone knows it's fairly killer here in terms of renting cost. Homes here are also extremely expensive, so I've focused on condos. I've had friends who've seen lots of appreciation on their purchases, I would love to benefit from that as well. In addition the tax savings from buying a home would help as well. I am not really sure how much I would save to be honest. i've tried to do the math a few times but I am not really sure I'm calculating it correctly.

Reasons I shouldn't buy:  
Buying a home in the bay area is F'n expensive.  Homes that would cost say 150K-200K in say Washington cost over 600K here. There is extreme competition to buy as well. People buy in all cash leaving absolutely no bargaining room. Another reason not to buy is since I owe so much in school loans, plus a huge payment every month I don't know if my monthly budget will balance out reasonably.   

So what do you guys think?

personalfinance,"How do I make the best of this situation? I'm 18, about to be self supporting, and going off to college.","So, I did post a general askreddit thread but I'm slowly realizing what I really need is financial advice.

My plan/The situation:

* June 1st, I am taking my clothes, my computer, my phone, and anything else I think I'll need and moving upstate to live with my best friend and her father for the summer.
* There, I will not pay rent and I will not pay for food. Technically, I won't be completely self-supporting as my mother has agreed to continue to pay for my phone bill and my contacts. However, my mother is not completely reliable (and by that I mean there are some months she simply chooses to spend her money on frivolous things leaving me wearing the same contacts for several days, but she has always paid the phone bill).
* I will create two sources of income: one, through a job I will hopefully acquire quickly once I'm up there, two, through something that's basically entertaining but I work for myself and set my own schedule that pays pretty good.
* Tax-wise, I will be marrying my (other) best friend very soon in order to qualify for independent status for better financial aid and also so that I will not be connected in any way to my abusive father. In case you're about to chastise me for this decision, we have been talking it over for two years and have put everything in writing. 

Here's where it gets fun. In the fall, I will be attending school. This is where it can vary a lot. In case you're wondering, female engineering major.

* If I choose to attend the school I was planning on attending originally, on top of federal loans I will have a gap of roughly $19,000. However, I will be contacting the school and explaining that my financial situation has changed and I will no longer be receiving any financial support for tuition from my parents. From what I've heard from many of my teachers and students at that school, the gap should be alleviated considerably. But I would still like to create backup plans.
* A different school has also accepted me and the gap there is $14,000. Again, I can and plan on contacting them to see if any other financial aid is available. This school is a state school and significantly less prestigious than the school I planned on attending and so I don't have my hopes up for more financial aid.
* If I get no help from either school or taking out private loans doesn't seem like a good idea, I can go to community college while living with my best friend and work while studying. Not preferable but I'll be able to knock out the few humanities that I still need to after my AP credits.

Obviously, I want to save as much money as humanely possible in between now and when school starts and I'm looking for help for how to do that and also advice for the coming years. 

Edit: Just wanted to clarify that the best friend I am marrying is not the best friend I will be living with. One is male, one is female.",finance,1400539086

personalfinance,Earning A Little More Interest On Your Savings,"Note: I pulled out any references to the companies I use to accomplish this strategy. But I wanted to post this in the event that this might be helpful in any way to someone else.

How do you maximize interest earned on savings in an era of low interest rates? Several years ago I remember enjoying a 4.01% interest rate on funds kept in a money market account. In early 2014, it's hard to find a money market account that will pay out one percent.

A few years ago I found a solution that kept my emergency savings liquid and keeping pace with inflation. I was recently asked for more detail on how I managed this solution, so I'm writing it up to share with others. This may not be the best solution out there, it's simply the best solution I have found that is currently available.

Step 1: Search for a ""high interest checking account"" (I redacted the URL I used on my site, I don't make money from referrals to them anyway.)

This site, which advertises heavily on financial talk radio programming, allows you to search for high interest checking accounts from community banks and credit unions. The accounts will vary from offering 0.5% to 3.01% interest on your balance.

Here are the multiple catches:

One: There are caps on the dollar amount at which the higher rates are offered.

It might be $10,000 or $25,000, but at some point you're going to go back to receiving ""normal"" rates of interest.
  
Two: Nearly all of the accounts require a direct deposit every month.

If you're going to use the account as your primary checking account and have your payroll deposit go here, no big deal. But if you're not looking to do so, there is a very simple way to satisfy this requirement. I'll go into that later.
  
Three: You have to post some number of debit card transactions a month to the account, usually ten.

This isn't too hard to satisfy. If you're buying lunch, groceries, or gas on a weekly basis then you can post ten transactions quickly and then put the card away for the rest of the month. I've heard other more creative solutions involving Square or another payment vendor to post ten transactions a month. That seems like taking the strategy just a bit too far. But that's only my opinion.
  
Step 2: Sign up for an account.

The [redacted] web site makes it easy to take the initial steps of signing up for and funding your new account. You'll need your current checking account routing and account number, your driver's license, SSN, and possibly your previous address information.
  
After you finish the online process, the bank itself takes over. They'll send you new account paperwork and get you connected with their online banking systems. They'll also send you a debit card and give you the promotional interest rate for the first month without the need for the mandatory number of transactions.
  
You're all done, right?

Well, you're just about finished.

Step 3: Connect an online brokerage to the new high interest account for deposits and withdrawals.

Here's where we handle two problems that dissuade most people from adopting this strategy.

1. How you're going to deposit funds into a bank that's not local to your town.

2. How you're going to satisfy the requirement for a ""Direct Deposit"", an ACH transfer every month.

My online brokerage where I have an individual investment account allows me to connect multiple checking accounts for deposits and withdrawals. So my local ""major"" bank was of course already connected to my broker a while ago. Whenever I would receive a deposit in my personal account I would pay bills and send the leftover funds to my broker. After adding my high interest checking accounts to my broker's funding options, I could just as easily transfer funds out to my new bank. This alleviated the need to mail deposits, and I found that the ACH transfers satisfied the ""Direct Deposit"" requirement when I received my monthly statements.

Step 3.5: Automate

So once I found that the ACH transfers out of my brokerage would satisfy the direct deposit requirement, I automated them. My broker allows you to setup scheduled deposits and withdrawals. So by setting up an automatic withdrawal from the broker, depositing into the high interest account I'll never miss that requirement in earning the higher interest rate.

Usually I automate a token deposit of $50.00 on the first of the month. Then I'll top up the account on the 15th of the month to account for spending or increasing the amount of money I'm holding in savings.

Step 4: Spend (A little)

I currently have a couple of these accounts, one for my emergency fund and one for personal travel savings and expenses. So I carry a couple of debit cards and pay for normal expenses with them, switching the card I use at the middle of the month. Thus far this has helped me to earn the higher interest rate every month for the past few years. I've got the 1099-INT docs to back that up.

Result:

It's not going to be an amazing amount of money earned. It's barely going to earn enough to fight inflation. But this strategy is going to add $300-$600 a year to your bottom line, where a traditional savings account might bring you $6-12. So it's a low maintenance option for savings that might be as complex as using an extra debit card or two a month.

Additional Benefit:

Most if not all of these accounts refund your ATM fees from any ATM you should choose to use. So now every ATM becomes one that you can access without fear of being gouged by high fees. Money typically is refunded for fees at ATMs inside of one week.

Additional Clarification:

I described this technique on http://www.reddit.com/r/finance at one point and I think one or two points were frequently missed. This is all about keeping money liquid, easy to access, and earning an acceptable return. Yes, there are all sorts of investments that will yield a better return. But they're going to lock up your funds or may go down in value when you need them most. You don't want to be pressured to sell any investment due to an emergency.

Also, I don't think these remote banks are great substitutes for a good local or national bank in your town. You're going to run into a circumstance where you need a notary, a cashier's check, or some level of personal service.

Finished:

So there's the entire strategy for earning a bit more interest on your savings. I welcome any questions, comments, or suggested improvements. The strategy isn't perfect, but it's low maintenance and appears to work.",finance,1400558187

news,Do You Feel You Can't Lose Weight?,"If you are having difficulty losing weight, do not try and follow the risky 'yo yo' dieting approach. Unfortunately, a lot of people who find it a challenge to shed excess weight do this all the time. They lose weight when they really work on it, but put it back on when they give up their diet and resume eating like they were before. The diet cycle that you endure every year does your body no good at all. It destroys your metabolism so that ultimately, the weight will not disappear even if you are exercising and eating the right foods.

The reason is because you keep putting your body into a mode of starvation and then having a food binge on items that are generally regarded as bad for you. Your system gets confused and it does not know when the next time it will be starved, so it basically reserves its energy.

Why Can't You Lose Weight?

Losing weight is not difficult. It is a basic formula of eating the right foods, not overindulging, and allowing your physical activity to burn off up the fuel that your body has been fed. But the difficultly with a lot of weight loss plans is that they are impossible to stay on them for longer than a few weeks or months. Nobody can live on an incredibly low calories intake.

People don't want to live a life where certain foods are off limits and induce feelings of guilt. So they do it for as long as they can stand it until they come to their breaking point and fall off the wagon.

Reasons For The Difficulty Losing Weight.

You might have different triggers that only provide short term results. For instance, maybe something stressful happens and you suddenly find yourself devouring a stack of sweets. Not only do you gain the weight back (and usually then some), but you pile on this mountain of disappointment and the feelings of failure that you have to now deal with because you've gone off track.

When the weight goes back on, it will not be muscle and fat, it will be pure fat. Then the difficulty losing weight becomes even more extreme. Perhaps now is time to change that. What would it be like to never have to battle with your weight and put yourself on a disciplined diet again?

If you can't seem to lose weight, no matter how hard you try, it could be that your not finding and eating the foods that burn fat naturally. It can be very hard to lose weight if you don't have a healthy eating plan that allows you to incorporate occasional treats and that is tailored to your metabolism type for optimal weight loss and overall health.

A friend came to me with some general questions about her loans. She has about 50k in federal loans--some Direct Loans (which would be eligible for PAYE), and some Stafford Loans.

She is currently enrolled in IBR, but fits the requirements to enroll in PAYE.

From what I understand, only Direct Loans can be paid under PAYE.

However, I had heard from a reputable source that it's possible to be enrolled in multiple IDR plans. I'm curious if she stay in the IBR plan for her Stafford loans and enroll in PAYE for her Direct loans.

personalfinance,My Finances are a mess,"Hi everyone,

 I'm 21 years old. I moved to the U.S. in 2010 and finished my senior year in high school here. It was tough for my parents moving. I already had 2 siblings that have been here since 2011, but they weren't and still aren't financially capable of supporting them.

 I've been developing websites since I was about 12 years old, and doing side jobs here and there. Upon coming to the U.S., I realized the market is huge. Anyways, job after job, and now I'm the lead developer of a company in the Detroit area. My salary is about $72,800 a year, more specifically $35 dollars an hour.

 Now, here's the terrible part. I barely stay afloat every month. I used to be able to save a lot ""by a lot I mean there used to be always around 6,7K in my account"" but now I barely escape overdraft. Last month, I did actually go into negative balance and had to cash advance to avoid extra overdrafts.

 **Here are my expenses:**

* My car's payment: $318 ""I'll explain why later.""
* My dad's car payment: $178
* Our insurance policy for these 2 cars plus a third focus: $400
* My apartment rent: $700
* My parent's mortage payment ""technically mine and under my name"": $410
* My parent's internet bill: $96
* My internet bill: $70
* My health insurance policy: $200 ""This was a mistake, I'm moving down to a $80 plan ""
* My aunt's internet. She recently moved here and I set internet up for them: $50
* phone: $340
 
 I also have a lot of really small things that add up. Website hosting, domain names, website subscriptions, stuff like that.


**My current debt is:**

* $2500 for a university
* $2000 for student loans
* $4000 on a credit card ""2500 of that is for a macbook""

The reason I got destroyed recently is cause I helped fund my mom's trip overseas ""paid around $1200""

I also paid for my dad's state taxes ""$1000"" till he gets his federal refund which should also be around that amount.

Other than that, I don't have much expenses. I rarely go out and I almost never shop. I don't drink, I don't smoke, etc...

I'm completely confused. I work 8 hours a day. Sometimes I don't go to work because I'm super stressed and that hurts my income. The fact that I feel the stress that I HAVE to go to work or the bills get unpaid kills me. I don't even really like my job. I wanted to be an astrophysicist growing up and that dream was thrown out the window. I'm depressed, and I sometimes have suicidal thoughts.

Help.

personalfinance,Student Loans and bankruptcy,"I hope this is the right sub. So...this is kind of a long story to get to a simple question so I apologize in advance.

I graduated from college in December 2009. I took a circuitous route through school, but my parents didn't want to leave me high and dry when I got out. So they agreed to divide my student loans into thirds. I picked up all the student loans from semesters where I flunked a class or dropped them all, and they picked up the remaining 2/3 and split it between them. The total was about 41k, with collection costs and late fees they are telling me it's around 70k now. 

I took several years off and worked during my college years, and when I did my folks told me if I wanted to go back it was on me, so every loan is solely in my name. I began paying my third as soon as I was out, my mother did the same, but my father (in a move that really surprised no one) didn't. Last February they began garnishing my paycheck for the 1/3 that he wasn't paying and emptied my checking and savings accounts. I should have kept a closer eye on it, but I didn't. And I have tried everything to get this cleared up. 

I tried to rehab it as soon as the garnishment started. But they wanted $250 every two weeks in addition to the amount being garnished. Adding the two together was $1100 which was essentially an entire paycheck every month. That lasted about 3 months. I contacted the Dept of Ed. Ombudsman/men to see if they could help out and make the repayment more manageable.  (my parents are divorced and my mom was finishing up her PhD so all of my loans are federally guranteed) I gave them three months to help, and they didn't accomplish anything. I called my congressman(who is on some student loan committe in Washington) and, unsurprisingly, my call went ignored. So now I stand on the precipice of Bankruptcy.

I've been in the banking industry since I graduated, and my goal has been to work my way up to a CFP or financial advisor. If I declare bankruptcy I can kiss that goodbye, no reputable firm or bank will sponsor me for my licenses, nor will I pass the government's financial responsibility guidelines. I have an appointment with an attorney on Friday, to help me decide what the best route is. I don't owe a ton on anything else. 

My car is almost paid for, it will be done in September, I've got some furniture that will be paid off in about 6 months, and my credit card is paid off and typically sits unused since I don't have the money in my limited budget to make payments on anything else. Even a minimum payment of $25 would spiral me out of control. I haven't missed a payment on my car, or the furniture. Sometimes they are late, but they always get paid. 

I know a bakruptcy won't discharge my student loans, but it will stop the garnishment immediately and my loans will go into deferment until the bankruptcy is discharged. My question is whether a bankruptcy is the best option. I don't have a ton of assets or liabilities so I think Chapter 13 is the right choice if I go down that road. Theoretically hiring an attorney to sort this out will give me more options, if bankruptcy is the wrong choice what are my other options? I'm not trying to get out of what I owe. I want to pay it back. I borrowed the money, I owe the money, it deserves to be paid back. But I can't go on living on the budget I have. Sometimes it comes down to groceries or gas to get back and forth to work, and the stress is killing me. Whatever advice y'all can give would be very appreciated.

personalfinance,You Can't Have Any More of My Money,"It was no extraordinary day yesterday, nothing phenomenal happened, and people like me with situations like mine doing what I did occur all the time. I should know, I work at a bank with a current lowest interest rate of 1.59% on all new, used, or refinanced auto loans. 

But I've been struggling for the past 5 years trying to pay off my accumulated student loans, for a degree that failed me. (Poor career/degree choice on my part; I take full responsibility.) Up until August 2013, I was living in an economically destitute city, with no promise of a full time job, benefits, progress on my loan payoff, or future for myself. Enough pity partying!

I moved back in with my dad and crazy mother to save on rent $$ (who is practically normal, but suffers still from ""Empty Nest"" syndrome, along with some very controlling tendencies that is unfortunately genetic. I, myself have chosen the child free life, so that disease will thankfully not pass to my future generations, but I digress.) I found two solid jobs, became a hermit, ate only at home, busied myself with inexpensive DIY crafts and gardening, focused on myself, essentially lived the most frugal life I could. It totally sucked, for I am a social butterfly by nature, and I moved far away from my long term SO to pursue this goal.

I am excited to say that with everyone's great advice on /r/personalfinance, and a *lot* of self discipline, I made my last giant payment on my existing student loan and closed it yesterday. I am beyond excited to go move back in with my SO (he's since moved to a different, more profitable city and acquired a stellar job himself), to move on to this new chapter of my life, but most importantly, to see finally that I could do it, a seemingly impossible feat that took dedication, diligence, and determination! I swear, if I can do it, you can too!

Thanks again everyone, for all of the great advice!

EDIT: Oh dear god, be still my heart and my inbox! I am humbled tremendously by all of your well wishes and kind words! You guys are the best and again, I must thank you all for all of great advice! Also, I *love* yall's creative analogies! 

EDIT II: A bit of **back story** and insight for those wondering. *Now, before you all go a bash me about my personal life choices, I must warn you, I'm not here to please the world. I'm here on this planet to be a good person and to do good things, and I am learning along the way. So please think before you write, eh? Try not to be a dick, it's not becoming of you.* I began college in 2007 to pursue a BS in Marine Biology. I had learned after graduating that I did not have the patience, funds, nor desire to become a dolphin trainer, a NOAA (National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration) researcher or a Professor of studies. I honestly, had no idea what I was going to do with that degree. 

So I moved on with my life and tried to find a decent job in my poor city while paying off my loans. I had found three random jobs there, but they were just getting me by, see: They didn't pay very well; and, with a 6.8% interest rate, I was actually accruing more interest than I was paying off the payments. I simply didn't have the funds to make a dent. I *am* and IVF egg donor and have donated twice, but those funds paid for medical bills, taxes and rent for a little less than half a year in 2011. I had been living with my SO at the time and we were splitting all the bills. It was still a struggle. When I moved home I found a great job as a personal banker at a bank and worked as a server at a very nice catering company after work sometimes and on the weekends.

I was making roughly $2500 to $2700-chunk payments per month on my $27,000 loan, and it took every effort to squeeze out what I could from each paycheck. While doing so, I spent time painting (I freelance paint); painting old birdhouses, decorative pieces donated from coworkers, canvases (essentially items that had been donated, found or which I had owned during my previous life). I gardened by finding palettes for raised beds, planted seeds from items I ate - it works and now I am harvesting an early summer crop! I did a bootcamp with my neighbor who has a kinesiology degree, read cookbooks my mom had - *anybody remember Betty Crocker's Cookbook? Anybody!?* - and perfected my cooking skills, and read books I had received for Christmas. So I think I stayed pretty busy. And while I look back on my time, it *does* appear rather boring to some, to me even. But life will go back to being a fun 20-something. I'll save for traveling, I'll invest in shares/stocks, I'll consider wise investments with my Sweetheart, and we'll have a good time doing it.

As far as my SO and I for those of you asking. His parents paid for his college education. (This does not lessen his value by any means in my eyes, nor should it in yours, but I can't control the way you think.) I was not about to ask him for his aid with something that was fully my responsibility. To me, that's just selfish and not fair; kind, but not fair. We made a 10-month long distance relationship work by talking on the phone nightly, my parents have a Skype account that I used to see his handsome face, and he made plans to visit about once every 2 months. It was really hard at times, and back in August, I never thought we'd get through 10 months. But here we are, and I'm moving back in with him at the end of June! Then we'll celebrate 4 years together this August. Remain truthful and open, and the time will fly by before you know it.

I'm hoping I've learned and do not plan on going back to old habits, I curse the younger version of me regularly for my poor financial decisions. I'll apologize now for the wall of text that's about to follow.

I've always had near minimum wage jobs, I probably could've done better with my money when I was younger. My parents always commented on how I couldn't save money, but they never really taught me how to save money either. I just downloaded YNAB a couple of weeks ago, took a couple of the classes, listened to a ton of the podcasts, read all up and down the forums and the blogs, and it's totally changed the way I think about money. Even though I've only been using it for a couple of weeks I think I'm already seeing a change in my spending habits.

I'll try to go as briefly as possible into the where and the how of my debt, even though I realize it doesn't really matter how I got to this point, the issue is to deal with it going forward.

**THE PAST**

There was period of time where I was unemployed and fell behind on my student loans and some other debt. When I would get a job it would always be at or near minimum wage and hard to catch up. Because of this I ""barely"" defaulted on 2 private student loans. I say ""barely"" because I tried to make a payment on one when I was able and they sent it off to another agency the day before and they wanted the balance paid in full immediately instead of my more manageable payment arrangements. They laughed at me when I offered to pay the previous monthly payment. The company wouldn't work with me at all, so I just ignored them for a long while, I felt it was all I could do. I have a federally subsidized student loan that was deferred for a long while, but I've been making the payments on for the last 6 months without any issue and actually just signed up for automatic payments and got a reduction of my interest rate because of that.

STUDENT LOAN DEBT
----------------------
*Fed Loan - Currently owe $13,000 (monthly $150) 5.625% Fixed
*Private Loan 1 - $8,000 Judgement filed in court
*Private Loan 2 - $11,000 Defaulted. It may have passed statute of limitations on collecting debt and they haven't filed a judgement.

I used to get phone calls all the time from debtors and couldn't keep track of who was who. I don't really get any phone calls anymore because it's been so long and at the time I was so broke they knew they couldn't really get anything from me.

Just to skim over some of my other debts, I have some very old credit card debt that's in collections, I have old bank accounts in bad standing from overdraft charges that I did not agree with, banks moving around transactions to maximize their overdraft fees. I was upset and unable in a position to pay them and felt they were in the wrong so I said screw them. So I'm in Chexsystems and this is causing me some difficulties now, not being able to open a bank account. I've been using pre-paid debit cards as my bank for a few years now and it's worked so much better never being charged an overdraft fee. It's really saved me from all of that stress and heartache while I was scraping by and living paycheck to paycheck. Although now, I would really like to have a joint checking account with my fiance so we can more easily manage our finances together, but I'm unable to with my past debts and being in chexsystems.

BANK DEBTS
------------
*Bank1 - I think around $500. I don't have the number in front of me.
*Credit Union 1 - $200
*Cred Union 2 - I think $130?
Yes, I had issues with credit unions not agreeing with overdraft charges as well.

CREDIT CARDS / OTHER
-----------------------
All credit cards are several years delinquent and in collections.
*CC1 - $2,000 (my credit report says this should fall off 11/2015. Is it even worth paying?)
*CC2 - $800
*CC3 - $700
*Collections - $103
*Collections - $133
*Comcast Cable - $103 They say I didn't return the equipment when I moved out of town years ago, even though I did. I didn't even know about this until I saw it on my credit report years later. I don't have Comcast where I live now. I don't know if I can dispute this like 4-5 years later.

Lastly, I made a poor decision years ago and owe my local courthouse about $10,000. I haven't really been paying on it for the last 7-8 years and they haven't made any attempts to collect. But I still owe it.

COURT
-------
*$10,000

**TOTAL DEBT** - around $45k

Last year, my fiance and I got the surprise of expecting our first child together, a beautiful little girl. She already had an awesome son when I met her, so we're a family of 4 now plus our dog. Luckily, last summer, I got a big break and got a job paying more than twice what I was currently making. I currently make around $45k-$60k a year. The higher range is potential if I end up working a lot of overtime, which happens from time to time. We also just got approved a couple of raises so I think my regular salary is around $50k now.

About the time I received my first paycheck my fiance was going on maternity leave, so we lost her income for a little while. By the time she was off maternity leave she was going to school and still has reduced hours, but I feel like we're in a pretty good position to start setting ourselves up for success. My fiance is going to school for nursing, so once she's done with school and lands a job I think we'll be in a really good position. She should end up making at least as much as I am, if not more eventually.

**THE PRESENT**

I'm pretty comfortable with our current monthly expenses. We've cut back in some areas

We rent a house from my grandmother for a more than fair price $900/month (would normally be about $1,200). We're in a pretty nice neighborhood and pay less than we did for our last place in an awful neighborhood. This house will stay in the family and could potentially be mine one day. I'm kind of counting on that because I don't see any way of me getting approved for a mortgage anytime soon. Point is, we're getting a killer deal on rent, my rent money stays in the family, and I could eventually inherit the house.

My fiance bought a used car last year which we paid off within about 9 months, so no car payment.

Groceries - we try to stay to a particular diet. I think we used to spend about $800/month on groceries pre-YNAB but now we're shooting for about $600/month. We rarely eat out.

Besides that we have our internet, cell phone, utilities, and car insurance.

About $200/month comes out of my paycheck per month into a state pension. I don't know too many details, but I know I need to start thinking about retirement and possibly supplementing this with some other kind of investment.

Also, my fiance has some old cc debt, nothing as extreme as me, but her credit is pretty bad. We were barely approved for our car loan last year with her mom as a co-signer. We're going to need to chip away at her debt as well.

**THE FUTURE**

So now is the time to look forward and figure out the best way to tackle this. The only other obstacle in the short term is our wedding. We have maybe $500-$1,000k that we need to pull together between now and this fall for our wedding. I don't see any problems fitting this into our current monthly budget.

My main question is, which debts should I tackle first? I would really like to open a regular checking account at a brick and mortar bank, so I'm thinking maybe those? With the YNAB method I think my fiance and I could better manage our finances in one large pool of money instead of it split between several accounts. Right now we're doing separate budgets because it seems the easiest to maintain with our different accounts.

Should I even ignore some of my oldest debts altogether? As I mentioned, one credit card says it's going to fall off my report in a year and a half. I've heard that paying really old debts can hurt your credit because it makes it current again on your report and stay on for another 7 years, or whatever the length is. Also, my one defaulted private student loan that hasn't made attempts to collect from me. If it's past the statute of limitations for collection then should I just ignore it at this point? I'm willing to pay what I owe, but all of my debts have been bought by other company's for pennies on the dollar at this point and the original debtors get tax write offs or something I've heard. I'll do what I have to do to get to a clean slate again.

The one with the judgement I know will need to be dealt with. Last they've heard from me I was barely making ends meet and I don't hear from them. Also, I assume my defaulted loans are still accruing interest at a high rate? I have no idea what the current status is of these.

How should I go about paying off these debts? Should I start sending away monthly payments or would it be better to save up chunks of money and try to settle with them for less than is owed? On most of the debts a large chunk of the balance is fees, not money I actually took from them. Plus they are now owned by 2nd or 3rd hand debt collectors. Also, they're not hounding me for payments, they've given up on me long ago.

personalfinance,Payday Loan Won't Close My Account,"To make a long story short, I signed up for a payday loan service in high school while I was working part time. Fortunately I always paid them off on time, but it led to many hassles beyond the loan fees (some scam artists called me saying I had a loan with them in collections trying to get money from me, though I called up the loan company to make sure). Anyway, now that I've realized how terrible an idea this is (in no small part thanks to you fine folks) and started saving money, I wanted to close the account in case someone got my login information or what have you. I didn't see an option on the site, so I began a live chat. Here is the transcript. Is there anything I can do? (I lived in RI at the time when I got the loans but have been living in NY for the past 5 years)

Me: Why not?

Me: I don't want to have an active line of credit with your company anymore.

Rep: You never had a Line of Credit with us. You only had payday loans in the past. 

Me: Yes, and in the event that someone were to get my username and password, I don't want them to be able to request loans from you against my account.

Rep: I'll be right with you.

Rep: Thank you for holding. 

Rep: I do understand, so I can mark your bank account information as bad and they will have to send in the proper documents to verify your account.

personalfinance,Help Needed! Pay back part of student loan immediately before Grad School or keep my 3M stock?,"I just graduated from an undergraduate program with $16,000 in student loans. Here is the breakdown: ~$7k in unsubsidized loans which is already accruing interest at 6.8% (although I have been paying interest so it doesn't capitalize); ~$7k  subsidized with a 3.86% interest rate that starts accruing after graduate school; and $2k in Federal Perkins loans with 5% interest rate that starts after grad school as well]. 

In the fall, I start graduate school for the next 4 years to get a doctorate of audiology (AuD), but THANKFULLY I got a research job that will cover tuition and have a monthly income of $1,100 to live on. 

I have about $6k in checking but need to buy a new computer (and would really love a MacBook Pro because I'll be on it a lot for grad school, so that is a upcoming $2k expense). I also have about $8k worth of 3M stock currently that was a gift from when I was born. 

**MY QUESTION:** Should I sell off all of my 3M stock to pay off my $7k UNsubsidized loan? This way I would avoid paying the interest of 6.8% over the next 4 years. (I won't accrue interest or have to pay on the $9k of other loans until after grad school). **OR** Should I keep all my 3M stock as a safety net and/or to go towards something big like a down payment of a car when I graduate?

personalfinance,Retirement Investment Strategies for our Imminent Retirees,"Hi fellow investors,

Seeing as most of the advice is here for us in our 20-30s, I wanted to learn some investment strategies for people who are nearing or at retirement.  Recently, I have consolidated one of my parent’s 401ks into a single IRA with Fidelity investments.  I’m getting ready to invest my parent’s money as it’s just sitting there currently, but of course am hesitant to do so with the market being at all time highs.   So I’ve been researching a portfolio for someone who isn’t going to be working much longer, and can’t take as many risks as most of us.


Right now, I’m leaning toward a 50% Bonds, 40% Equities, 10% Commodities balance.  


With our usual 20-somethings advice, we usually recommend investing in low fee index funds and etfs with dollar cost averaging.    But for bonds, I really have no clue.  I’ve never personally invested in bonds before and would really like recommendations on what to research/invest in.


Should I look into bond funds etfs?  (Like BND, BOND) -  These seem simple as buying a stock.  Enter ticker, limit price, shares, done.


Individual bonds?  Government treasuries, corporate bonds, municipal bonds? – I’ve never even tried buying these from brokers.

Also, how do I protect the portfolio from the fed’s possible looming interest rate increases?  I’ve read about staggering bonds, with different expirations like 1 year, 5 year, 10 year, etc.  Anyone have experience managing this type of portfolio and can offer some advice?  I’m usually a lot more experimental and ballsy with my own portfolio, but because this is my parent’s and I don’t want to screw up their retirement, I’m fine with being conservative and boring.

personalfinance,"""The debt can not be paid off with the given monthly payment and interest rate!""","I just tried out CNN Money's [Student Loan Calculator](http://cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/studentloan/studentloan.html) on my Sallie Mae private loan and received the following terrifying message: **""The debt can not be paid off with the given monthly payment and interest rate! The monthly payment is too low to even pay the interest on the loan.""**

My knee jerk reaction is to try to increase monthly payments to start putting a dent into the balance. *But this isn't even my biggest or highest interest student loan.*

A little background:
I'm 2 years out of college and currently in repayment of my 6 different student loans (4 private and 2 federal). I went to an excellent private school for $55k/year without any tuition support from my parents. They wish they could have helped, but they're both teachers. They simply couldn't afford it. 

I didn't qualify for any scholarships or grants, so it was all paid with loans. My parents made *just enough* that we weren't offered much in the way of federal loans, so most of it is private. 

The breakdown:
#1 Private Sallie Mae Signature
     Balance: $58,175.81
     Monthly Payment: $277.68
     Interest Rate: 5.75% Variable

#2 Private MEFA Student Alternative Loan 
     Balance: $30,038.54
     Monthly Payment: $334.18
     Interest Rate: 8.29% Fixed

#3 Private MEFA Student Alternative Loan (this one's in Mom's name)
     Balance: $59,406.54
     Monthly Payment: $639.42
     Interest Rate: 8.49% Fixed

#4 Private NJ Class
     Balance: $57,935.39
     Monthly Payment: $543.30
     Interest Rate: 7.92% Fixed

#5 Federal Sallie Mae DL Consolidated Subsidized Loan
     Balance: $15,351.96
     Monthly Payment: $0.00 (Income-Contingent Repayment)
     Interest Rate: 5.63% Fixed

#6 Federal Sallie Mae DL Consolidated Unubsidized Loan
     Balance: $5,132.60
     Monthly Payment: $0.00 (Income-Contingent Repayment)
     Interest Rate: 5.63% Fixed

Total debt today: $226,040.84
Total monthly payments right now: $1,794.58

Right now I'm making minimum payments. I renegotiated about a year ago to make lower, interest-only payments on the Private Sallie Mae Signature (Loan #1). As I mentioned, the calculator says Loan #1 will never be paid off if I continue to make minimum payments. I have about an extra $1000/month income that I should put toward loans. 

My question is, should I put the extra $1000/month toward Loan #1 or toward larger, higher interest loans (like 8.29% and 8.49%)?

Additionally, my mom's name is on one loan (mentioned above), and I know she and her credit would appreciate either getting her name off (not sure if that's possible) or paying the loan off.

Any other advice you can provide would be much appreciated! I'm 24 and pretty lost here.

* 1 share of GOOGL
* 10 shares of KOS
* 1 share of SCHX
* 2 shares of SCHA
* 2 shares of SBUX
* 6 shares of TSLA
* 4 shares of YHOO


I have around $500 in P2P lending doing really well, staying at around 17% return.

I'm finding that they aren't worth what I paid for them though... so I either sell them for metal value or just hold em and hope silver jumps.


Should I just let everything sit?  I feel like I'm being foolish with the IRA...  Sometimes I want to sell it and throw it into P2P - other times let it sit... Other times move it around.  Should I take this money out to pay off my student loans or credit debt?

personalfinance,First time poster... Need help with student loans!,"I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the loan companies don't make things clear enough for an 18-year-old to understand... When I enrolled in school I knew I would be paying loans for the next 10 or 15 years. I went to an expensive school, didn't qualify for many scholarships, didn't have a job or any money, and my parents couldn't help pay. But I never understood the extent of the hold it would have over my life.

I placed pretty much my entire tuition on loans from Sallie Mae... By my junior year, I had reached the limit they would let me take out (tuition increasing, federal grants/unsubsidized loan amounts decreasing) and I had to take out private student loans with my bank at the time, Chase.

Relatively speaking I don't owe much to chase. That is not a burden. The issue is with Sallie Mae. I was under the impression when I took out these loans that they were federal loans, and that there would be some sort of repayment plan for me. I didn't keep track of how much I was taking out. The numbers were all too large for me to comprehend. My parents didn't go to college. I figured, I don't know what's ahead, but I will be able to manage it. Many people before me have taken on student loans. Surely the repayment will be manageable, or there will be an option for me.

Around the time I graduated, I got an email letting me know my federal loans would now be services by a company called Nelnet. Okay I thought, no more Sallie Mae. I didn't think this affected me in any way. When I graduated a year ago, I had to take Exit Loan Counseling. I thought it was very helpful. It explained in very clear terms how I would be repaying my debt to Nelnet. I created a budget and selected a Graduated Repayment plan. I felt confident that I could deal with a $250 monthly expense. I started paying down interest over the summer. I moved across the country and got a job at Starbucks.

This January, I started receiving phone calls from Sallie Mae, telling me I was late on a payment. I was confused, since my loans were supposed to be with Nelnet - and besides, I hadn't received any mail or emails from Sallie Mae in months. After doing some research, it became clear to me that the majority of my student loan debt is indeed through Sallie Mae, and it is private. Although my federal loans were transferred to Nelnet, three gigantic Sallie Mae loans remain and there is no manageyourloans.gov or Graduated Repayment plan to help.

My debt to Sallie Mae totals over $500 a month - between Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and Chase, I pay almost $1000 every month. In my state, minimum wage is $7.25/hr and my piece of junk apartment that I share with a roommate costs me $400/month.

After going through a period of serious anxiety, I decided to take control of my life and come up with a strategy. I refused to move back home with my parents (my gf moved here with me after a year dating long distance, plus I moved to pursue a career in music, an industry that thrives in my current city). I got a second job at a restaurant that paid minimum wage but included tips and started working 50+ hours/week. I made a strict budget and started really organizing my finances better. After several months this proved to be unsuccessful. I still could not make my payments to Sallie Mae on time. I couldn't find space in my schedule to do what I love or take my gf out. I had no money and no time.

I recently quit both jobs and started doing higher-paid office work for a temp agency. I am still attempting to pursue a career in music, which makes it very difficult to accept long-term positions, but at the same time I have been gaining more and more paid work in music.

This month I missed my payment deadline again for the loan with the highest minimum monthly payment. My paychecks are inconsistent, and week to week I have no idea how I will be making money.



This brings me to my actual question. Lowering the amount that I have to pay per month towards my student loans would not just alleviate stress. It will allow me to pursue a career doing what I love, to move into an apartment that isn't falling apart, and maybe even to stay in the city my gf lives in. When I called Sallie Mae, they told me there are no repayment options available for my loans. There is no way to lower that monthly payment amount except to enroll in automatic debit. Since I have been consistently missing my payment due dates every month, I am hesitant to enroll. Google research suggests I may be able to consolidate my loans (I have three through Sallie Mae) to help a little bit, although it's unclear to me how I would go about doing this.

Are there any other options available!? I know I have to pay an unimaginable amount of money, I am okay with that! I just can't be paying so much right now! I need a way to lower my monthly payments, even if it means raising the total amount I owe or extending the repayment term.

**Background:** I graduated in May 2010 with about $28,000 in student loans; about $5000 in a private loan at 2.1% and $23,000 in federal ""subsidized"" loans at 6.8%.  Not really knowing the nuances of student loans at the time and just knowing that 6.8% was way too high of an interest rate, I made the effort to pay them off as quickly as I could by making extra payments. Every couple of months I'd pay an extra $1,000 on one of the high interest loans, but I never watched my balance very closely.

After about a year of this I started seriously looking into refinancing my federal loans at a better interest rate. After looking into student loans at several banks I learned that banks are not allowed to offer private loans to refinance federal loans. Of course I was annoyed because I could have qualified for a very good rate due to my good credit and relatively high income. 

One bank told me that only a federal consolidation loan could be used to refinance federal loans, so I applied at finaid.org and was informed that I could get a loan at the ""low"" rate of 11.2%.  Obviously that was a step in the wrong direction, so I didn't pursue it. 

**First sign of trouble:** Around the same time, I decided to look through my payment history because my balance was still around $22,500. After a year of paying off my loans to the tune of $330 a month plus an additional $4000 in extra payments I figured I would have paid a bigger chunk off by now. Well it turns out that only about $45 of each payment was being applied to the principal and the rest was going to interest. What's more, there was no record at all of the 4 extra $1000 payments I had made over the past year. 

I immediately called the federal servicer and was told that no such extra payments had been made. I was furious. I had the bank statements showing the ACH withdrawals and they claimed I had never given them the money. After some choice words to the operator I was transferred several times and finally able to talk to a supervisor who explained that my loan type was ""not authorized"" for early payoff and that the extra payments were being held ""in reserve"" until my next due date. Basically any amount paid above the minimum was not applied to the principal until the next payment was due so as to allow maximum interest to accrue. (I later found out that there are specific laws that prohibit PRIVATE lenders from doing this but that they is some gray area when it comes to the federal government doing it). 

I was defeated.  I didn't have any options so I resigned myself to paying the full interest on my loans and chalked it up to being one of those students who didn't realize what they were getting into when they took out student loans.

**Tough times:** Around this time I had to leave my job for medical reasons, so having an extra reserve to cover my payments actually made things easier. I spent the next 9 months getting healthy and job searching. Finally in February 2012 I landed a good job offer and moved across the country. It took the rest of my savings and a personal loan from my grandmother to afford the relocation but I made it happen. Unfortunately about this time my extra ""reserve"" payments were depleted and I just couldn't afford to make that month's minimum payment on my federal loan (my new job was a salaried position and I wasn't going to get my first paycheck until I had worked a full month).  I asked for an unemployment deferral and was granted it. 

**Things start to look up; but more shadiness ensues:** As soon as I got my first paycheck (about three weeks after the deferral) I called and asked to resume making payments. They explained to me that the interest accrued during the deferral was to be rerecapitazed and added to the principal. Well apparently there is some sort of penalty or additional interest accrued during an unemployment deferral because now my balance was over $23,000!  Basically, after nearly two years of on time payments, being three weeks late set me back further than where I was when I started!

Angry at myself for losing two years of payments, I redoubled my efforts to get rid of these loans. Luckily my servicer was offering a consolidation loan that would give me a whole 0.25% interest rate reduction if I used Auto Pay, so I took advantage of that. I also called and pressured them about being allowed to make extra payments. After some arguing and finally threatening to hire a lawyer (kind of a bluff on my part) I was told of the process for making extra payments. Basically, it involved filling out and faxing a form ""requesting"" to make an additional payment, waiting 7 to 10 business days for approval, then sending a cashier's check for the approved amount by certified mail to the processing center. I'll admit that was too much of a hassle, so they got what they wanted and I didn't make any additional payments. 

**Finally, a way out:** Fast forward to December 2013 and I finally found a way out of my federal loans. A new company that uses crowd sourced funding from alumni of certain schools was able to grant me a loan to pay off my federal loans for a much lower interest rate and no hassle for additional payments. They even directly dealt with the federal servicer so I didn't have to worry about it. I am now paying $30 more per month, but my loan will be paid off four years sooner!

**The snag:** Due to processing times, there was a small snafu in posting off the old loans. The payment from the new company was cleared December 15, but the federal servicer did not credit my account until the 22nd. One of my automated payments was scheduled for the 17th (side note: because there were actually five distinct loans on my account, the payments were split with one being due the 3rd of the month and the other due the 17th). As a result, an extra $186.39 was taken from my checking account. 

I called a couple weeks later to find out about getting refunded the money from my extra payment. After another round of transfers and holding I finally talked to a woman who said they would review it and let me know what the deal was within a few weeks. I heard nothing. Finally after a month of waiting I called again and eventually talked to a supervisor (again).  After explaining the situation, they sent me a description of the refund process via a secure message on their site. It said that my case would be submitted to the Department of the Treasury for review, which would take 45 days. After the review, if a refund was approved they would send me a check in 30-180 days. I was annoyed that it was going to take so long, but replied to the message confirming that this was what I requested and specifically stating that I wanted to be refunded via a check mailed to me at my home address. 

**The most recent developments:** Last week, since the 45+30 days had passed since I last spoke to the federal servicer I figured I would check on the status of my refund. I tried to login to my account online and was hit with an ""Access Denied: Account Locked For Fraudulent Activity"" screen. I immediately called them and was told that I no longer had access to my payment history and secure messages because my account had been terminated. I explained the situation and asked about my refund and the operator told me there was no such extra payment made. I was literally looking at my bank statement from December showing the ACH withdrawal in question on December 17. She insisted that I was mistaken and that there was no record of the payment or the review I had requested. 

I asked to speak to a supervisor and she made some remark that ""threatening her wasn't going to change the facts"" before finally transferring me. I then calmly explained to the supervisor the situation and she told me the same thing: that no extra payment was made. I insisted that I had a bank statement proving there was and she finally relented and ""found"" a transaction on December 17 for $171.xx, but that a check had already been sent to me and cashed. I then asked for a copy of the cancelled check to prove it (since I had never received one) and she said I wasn't authorized to have that information, but that she would submit the case for review. I then asked her to send me a written verification via email with a case number and she wouldn't do it. So I asked to speak to HER supervisor and she refused. Finally I asked her for her name and employee number and she immediately hung up on me. 

So this is where I am. Unfortunately I didn't screen shot any of my account information before they locked me out, so the only proof I have of their illegal practices is my bank statement showing the extra payment and the loan payoff confirmation which I downloaded as a pdf. I'm tempted to call them back and record the conversation to have some more evidence. My concern is that if I were to try and file a lawsuit against them the fees would be more than the amount they stole.

personalfinance,Early twenties with money to invest,"I am in my early twenties, I have no debt, and I currently max out my 401k. However I still have ~1-2k a month left to invest. Currently all that extra goes into my savings account, I have enough to cover my living expenses for 3 months plus about $25k in there. I also donate a few thousand a year to some local charities. 

I'd like to take the 25k and future income and do something worth more than a measly .01% interest rate. I've thought about an IRA but my annual salary is too high for the tax benefits. Plus I'd like to have some more liquid cash than an IRA.

The only other options I can see for myself is opening an investment account with Schwab/Vanguard/eTrade to invest in ETFs and other Mutal Funds (my job restricts me from shorting, options, and day trading (buy/sell within 30 days)).

I've toyed with the idea of real estate, but I don't think I have enough for that. I am also a pretty busy person and don't know if its worth the time at this stage in my life.

Advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans considering...?,"I don't post or comment often, but I follow this sub, and others similar to it, regularly. So here's my current scenario and looking for suggestions...

Mortgage 1: $102k @ 3% (rental property)
Mortgage 2: $225k @ 2.75% (primary residence)
Student Loans: $35k @ 3.125%

We are considering selling our primary residence, from which we should net about $80k - $90k after commissions, closing costs, etc and purchasing a new home within 9 - 12 months.

I will also be receiving a sizable bonus from work which, after taxes, would allow me to pay off the remainder of the student loan debt. 

I currently max out my 401k and both Roth IRAs for my wife and I (using the backdoor method) so using the bonus money here is not an option.

We also have a sufficient emergency fund in place.

Here's my question: if we decide to sell our primary home and buy a new home, certainly the interest rate on that mortgage will be higher than any of my current loans as mortgage rates are currently north of 4%, is it better to save my bonus and use towards a larger downpayment on the new home's mortgage or pay off the remaining student loan? I am not eligible for any tax benefits from the student loan interest due to income level whereas with the mortgage interest, I would be able to deduct this year after year.

I have always followed the ""pay the highest interest loan first"" principle  but this one I can't seem to justify 100%, although I am leaning this way (i.e. saving the money for a larger downpayment).

personalfinance,Balance Transferring to New Credit Cards - affect on credit score?,"OK, so here's the basic breakdown. I pay about $225/mo for federal student loans (not really worried about that, don't remember the rates), $200/mo for car loan with about 3.5 years left at around 10% IIRC (first car loan), and then there's three credit cards. The first two are not so bad - about $100 and $150 per month, with interest rates no more than 20%. The first has about a $3700 balance, the second has around a $6000 balance. The third, is bad...the balance is around $11,000, and the payments (minimum) are $382/mo at a whopping 29% interest rate. This is with First Financial Bank, and I will go out of my way to advise ANYONE against going with this bank for a first credit card. But I digress...

Obviously my biggest concern is the card with the highest balance/interest rate. College books combined with a cross-country move and some hard times immediately after the move made that one blow up. I currently plan on paying $400/mo to try to pay it down, which puts me out at about 4 years to have it paid off. However, I'd really like to pay it off sooner. Last I checked, my credit was average to slightly below average, but despite that I could not get a personal loan from a local credit union to pay off the majority of that card.

I'm now wondering if it would be at all beneficial for me to get a new credit card, transfer the balance (or even some portion of the balance), and use the lower interest rate. That would require someone to give me a credit line that's high enough, but I feel like maybe it's worth a shot. But more importantly, would this improve my credit score, or even maintain it? I don't want to do anything that could lower it. (I understand that if I start missing payments it would lower my score, so I'm strictly talking about the score being lowered simply because I got a new card.)

Anyone have thoughts on what might be best to do here? My budget is pretty solid and I do not wish to live in a cardboard box for 4 years, so please don't tell me I need to quit spending all money at all and live under a rock. I'm all right with sticking with the current plan, but that interest rate just makes me feel like I'm really getting the shaft and I'd like to do something about it if possible.",finance,1400639629

personalfinance,"Student debt, consolidation, collections: We need some insight, reddit","Okay, so as the title said, there are three things. All related, and unfortunately, we are dealing with all three and are wondering what the heck do we do. (also, throw away acct)

This occurred over the space of the past 3 years. (Been married for about 6-ish months)

To start off, my wife has over 23k in student debt from only one year of going to a private college. She was only able to stay for one year due to her father getting laid off. She was the only person in her family that had a job, and so she did what her and I both believe, with hindsight, to have been the right thing: Go home, stop college, and support her family (mom, dad, 4 younger siblings, and taking care of grandma). It would have been awesome for her to have stayed in college and earn a degree, all of that fun stuff, but - her family needed her help.

I'm not sure on all of the details of how little money there was. Times were rough. Money was tight and not spent if possible. (as far as I know. They aren't the most frugal family, and could definitely make some cuts - average family)

Student loans started asking for money, of course. She was able to get deferments for awhile... how long? I'm not sure exactly. I believe my wife ran out of deferment and only made payments every once in a while, every few months or something. When you are a college dropout being the only source of money for a family with four kids in high school, there wasn't much to go around. Especially when you have 3 different loans all asking for large payments. It was such a big, scary, foreign concept to her, and she now fully realizes the consequences of just trying to ignore it and hope it would go away.


Info on Loans, to the best of my knowledge (don't have paperwork directly in front of me):
#1

* **Beginning Balance:** $14,000
* **Current Balance:** Approx. $14,900
* **Interest:** Previously a 2.9%, BUT the debt has increased enough and she was able to prove financial hardship, that they agreed to a **0%** interest rate. I think I might like this loan group, whoever they are.


#2
(Technically two loans combined, one is Fed Sub and other is Fed Unsub)

* **Beginning Balance:** $6,000
* **Current Balance:** Approx. $6000
* **Interest:** 5.75%

-This loan has had more payments on it I believe, because the balance is still about the same. Yea, basically only interest has been paid.. kinda sucks


#3
-This loan starts out with a story: It is a Federal Perkins loan that my wife believed to have been combined with loan #2 (remember, loan #2 is technically more than one loan) Approx. 1.5-2 years ago, the same time as all of the other loan groups, they contacted her to begin paying off the loan, she got it deferred, and **never heard from them again.** Here is why: within the next couple months, she moved out, got a new cell number, and switched to a different job 3 hrs away (father got temporarily employed, family had some disagreements, she left). The college kept trying to get ahold of her at her *parents'* home address, but the family would ignore all mail, and phone calls, that were for my wife. Nor would they pass on to my wife any mail/kind of a message ""oh hey some loan company tried getting ahold of you"". And if they did happen to mention loan stuff, my wife probably thought it was loan #1 or #2 since she wasn't completely consistent on those payments yet, and disregarded anything they said (again... family disagreements, so it's not like either side liked talking to the other) --- **Fast forward to 2 weeks ago**. My wife gets a call from a debt collections. They somehow have her new number. They state there is a loan under her name, which is loan#3, which has defaulted and has been sitting in collections for approx. 9 months. They demand payments NOW of course... which they say the lowest they can go is a hair below $500.

* **Original Balance:** $2000
* **Current Balance:** Approx. $3000
* **Interest Rate:** ~6.9%

So after reading around here on /r/personalfinance and such, I help her understand the nature of CA's and to start out with requesting for the proper documentation mailed to us. 

But at this point, I am now lost. I'm not sure where we should go from here. Do we want to do some kind of a debt consolidation? If so, who with?

I'm going to be in college for at least another 3 years, without much chance of any kind of a job except a simple part time. (In a college town, there is such a high supply of people looking for employment, I'm still without a job) So I'm not exactly able to bring much to the table. And she is currently working at a restaurant as a shift manager/delivery driver.

So, if I can wrap this up, it might be something like this:


* Loan#1 - $200/mo
* Loan#2 - $70/mo
* Loan#3/CA - currently in limbo, demanding $500/month
* Car loan - $200/mo
* Utilities - $90/mo
* Rent - Taken care of (Thanks to my dad for the EdIRA/Coverdell!)
* Gas - $140 (we have alot of driving, and she's a delivery driver)
* Internet - $40
* Food and life necessities like toilet paper - maybe $250?


Equals: Approx.$985 in expenses each month. This is a rough guess however, since I'm typing this all in one shot. We don't have fancy stuff like TV, Netflix or XM.

The rest of our money we sincerely try to put into savings, but my car just got a new transmission, which depleted my savings down to less than $200. (Never will buy a car from Las Vegas craigslist EVER AGAIN)
Often, savings doesn't happen, because each month we have a new expense: Have to replace vacuum = $180, Replace cracked sway bar on car = $200, etc. Being young and freshly married, we don't have much.

So I restate the question I want answered: Now what? Help me out with any tips you have, ask questions about any details you need, suggest an outline for what to do for the next 3 months, 6 months, 3 years, whatever. 

Thank you reddit, for any and all hope and/or advice you can give us.

I've been wanting to go back to school and take a more advanced career path in the medical field and this is my chance. 

My first thought, like many other posts I see here, was to pay off all debt. About 10k in credit card and auto loans then almost another 19k in student loans from my bachelor's.  I feel that even though that would take a large chunk of that money out right away it will be better in the long run. 

My next thought was the manner in which I received this money. My GM is in Florida and I'm in Georgia. I think I read that there is no gift tax in GA. Especially when it is paid from. Third party for student loans or medical expenses. 

Assuming no tax for the student loans I think I could set it up to have Sallie Mae take care of that. What are the tax implications of the other money? Is there a certain amount per year she could bequest to me and avoid heavy taxes or would it be good to take the money, pay the appropriate taxes and put it in to a high yield savings account? 

This is very new to me and I have not been the best with money in the past so I want to be responsible with this incredible opportunity afforded to me.

personalfinance,"Offered 10% ownership in my company, and a spot on the Board of Directors... a little worried about liability. Should I do it? [Sweden]","Hey /r/personalfinance!

So here's my situation. I am 22, live in Sweden, currently make about 40 - 42K a year at my job as an account manager for a small publishing company, working in the advertising department. I like my job, I'm still relatively new at it (I am currently in my 5th month here). My boss came to me yesterday and wanted to thank me for all of the hard work I have been putting in, how dedicated I've been &amp; how I've been showing a genuine interest in the company's future and how to help it thrive, and my wanting to be a part of the company for the foreseeable future. Then said that I was to be offered a 10% stake ownership in the company, without having to buy in, and a request that I join the Board of Directors to help ensure the company would keep growing in the right direction, and take some of my ideas seriously. I was totally taken aback, and very honored to be asked. I told my boss I would think about it, we'd discuss it further in a few days, and that I needed to talk to my partner.

I am ambitious, and the idea of being a part-owner in a rather successful small company, plus a member of the Board of Directors, at the age of 22, without having to buy in? Definitely appealing. My partner thought it was a good opportunity, provided I'm not putting myself into a position where I might be on the hook &amp; liable for a ton of debts, taxes, lawsuits, or anything else imaginable if, God forbid, something happened to the company. And I agree with him 110%.

I called the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (Svenskt näringslivet) to ask them exactly what I would have to expect as a part-owner and as a member of the Board of Directors. I was told:

- as a part-owner, I have no personal liability when it comes to debts or anything incurred by the company. That comes instead from any money staked in the company (which won't apply to me anyway since I am not being asked to buy-in).

- as a member of the Board of Directors I *could potentially* be held liable if the taxes are not properly documented and filed within 15 months of the start of each year, or if a crime is committed by the company or the Board. But since my company is what is called an ""aktiebolag"", we are legally required to have a state licensed (and with no marks on their record) accountant who goes through our books and assists with our taxes each year. So mistakes don't happen often (and if they do, the accountant is usually the first person held responsible), it's usually when proof of direct &amp; intentional tax fraud comes forward that the Board of Directors' liability comes into play. 

So, I am sort of unsure what I want to do here. This feels like an awesome opportunity, and since as a part-owner I won't be held liable for anything, I feel like I should definitely jump on. I can always sell my stake in the company back, or if my boss ever decides to sell the company, I will earn 10% of the sale - definitely **not** a bad investment to have in my back pocket. But when it comes to this Board of Directors thing... I would love to do it, and I am up for the challenge. But the idea that I could possibly be held liable is a bit scary. Don't get me wrong: my boss is one of the most genuine people I have ever met, totally on the up &amp; up, totally dedicated to the company and keeping a spotless reputation. I would never in a million years worry that my boss was committing fraud, embezzling money, intentionally trying to screw someone, anything like that. **But**, I also know that usually when these big news stories come out about a company being involved in some undercover illegal stuff, the first thing they say about the CEO or the other people involved is how ""no one could imagine them doing something like this"". And since I only make about 40K a year, my partner makes roughly the same, and we have two small children, I am not exactly wanting to put myself in a position where I could be owing a lot of money to the government *IF* something went belly up.

I get to the closing desk with the finance manager, and proceeds to tell me that the ""program"" he got for me to get me such a great interest rate includes an Extended Warranty and GAP coverage, to the tune of about 2882.00 total. *Of course*, with this great rate he got me, the payment would only differ by a few dollars from my original pre-approved rate.

I tried to refuse the add-on items (I know they're bullshit and illegal to force on people) but he said this great rate ""program"" includes it, or if I didn't want this ""program"", my rate would be 5 points higher, which would make the monthly payment essentially the same as with the coverage at the lower rate.

We're both rather financially responsible people, with good understanding of money, debt, interest, etc. and have similar views/habits when it comes to money, saving, and spending. 

A while back my SO made a comment that she'd highly consider paying of the remainder of my student loans (roughly $40k now, probably closer to $30k by the time we'd be married w/ an avg interest rate of about 6%). We both understand the benefits of paying off the debt ASAP, but I have very mixed feelings about this (her mother is very against it, but SO said it doesn't matter if it's what's best for us). 

She has the money to do so, but it would wipe out the majority of her savings. While I do have savings, they're currently aimed towards a) a reasonable ring, b) a small down payment (what I can put towards that), and c) a very healthy emergency fund (thanks /r/personalfinance). Now, with loans payed off I could rather easily start putting the $600+/mo that was going to ring savings and loan payments directly towards other savings goals.

Yes, we'd like a downpayment to buy a place eventually, but we both have good jobs and could save aggressively and do this relatively quickly (just a counter argument to what else we could use that money for, but maybe I'm looking at this wrong). 

My reservations come from the fact that I feel that my debt is my responsibility even if we're married and have combined the majority of our finances. I also take a lot of pride in the fact that I paid for my education, and now I'm gainfully employed to the point where I'll be able to pay off my loans. Having her contribute her savings a) diminishes that and b) takes away the pride she might feel in using her hard earned money (in my mind at least).

So, ultimately, I'm curious what others have done, am I looking at this correctly, and is there anything else we should be considering?

TL/DR: SO has offered to pay off student debt upon marriage, I'm uneasy about it and looking to gain perspective.

personalfinance,"Advice - student loans, savings, travel, and post grad.","The following is my financial situation:

Job (contract): $2850 net monthly

OSAP (gov't student loans):
$400 min monthly payment ($32k total)
Floating interest rate (%) + 2.5%
Fully paid off in 8.5 years @ $400/m

Student Line of Credit from bank:
$19,000 @ prime + 1% (increasing 1% every year until paid off)

This is my plan - any advice/critique welcomed:

My work contract is 12 months, in this time I plan on paying down the following:

OSAP - continue making $400/m payments which should decrease my principal amount to $28,000

SLOC - pay down $5000 on principal (making $500 payments per month)

Rent/Transit - $1000/month

Other expenses - $200/m

Savings for travel - $500/m

After my contract ends I plan on traveling SE-Asia for 2 months which is why I want to save $5000 over the course of my contract. I know many will critique this part of my plan but it is something I am set on doing before getting my MBA since I plan on being fully immersed in my work after finishing this degree. 

In addition to this, I plan on going back to school for an MBA when I return from travels. This post-grad will mostly be funded by another student line of credit, OSAP, and some bursaries. 

Given this information, I have a few questions:

- what is the likelihood of getting another student line of credit for $50,000 with already having student loans? The school has a relationship with RBC bank for the MBA program...

- should I decrease my student line of credit payments to a lower monthly amount if I just plan on getting more loans when I go back to school? Something like $300 instead of $500?

- I'm just focusing on $400 OSAP payments (my minimum is $385) since these payments will stop when I go back to school

Also, for my OSAP I have the option of choosing between 
a) floating rate + 2.5% OR
b) fixed rate + 5%
Would the fixed rate option be better? I guess I am more so asking this for when I have to continue paying back the loans after I receive my MBA

personalfinance,Should I refinance my 6.125% fixed rate student loan into a 2.785% variable rate? What are the realistic chances it goes up?,"Hi everyone, first post here so maybe go easy on me?

I have a student loan, original balance about $49,000, fixed rate at 6.125% for 10 years.  I'm paying about $567/ month and all payments are current.  I've got about 9 years left on the loan.

I have the opportunity to refinance this into a variable rate 2.785% loan and I'm considering doing it.  The rate is capped at 8.95%.  The interest rate reduction would save me about $70/ month right now.  Of course, the catch is that the rate could go up.  But really, how likely is that?  My understanding is that the Fed would keep the libor rate low until the economy is doing much better... so probably not for a long time!  Even if it bumps up a little bit, it would have to go up quite a bit before it made it past the 6.125% I am currently paying, so I'm having a hard time seeing why I should not do this.  If it ever did rise above a certain rate, I could just refi again back into a fixed rate.

**TL;DR: I think I should refi my fixed rate loan into a variable because I'm confident the variable rate will be lower than my current rate for a long time.  Good idea?  How likely is it that today's variable rate will rise from ~3% to over 6% within the next 10 years?**",finance,1400694984

personalfinance,What should we do about our mortgage?,"Our house has $151,000 left on the mortgage and I bought it in 2007 for $167,500. (Obviously at the height of the market and with no money down. Stupid me.) It's at least $10,000 upside down, as I'd be surprised if it would sell for $140,000. The interest rate is 6.5% and we're 7 years into the 30-year mortgage. The monthly payments, including escrow (all house-related fees) and PMI is $1372. It is our only big monthly expense, as our cars are paid off and we don't have credit card debt etc. I do have student loans but they're at a fixed government rate of 2.1% and the monthly payments are $366.

I had looked into refinancing the house maybe 4-5 years ago and I would have had to bring at least $20,000 to the table because the house was so upside down. Then I started my own law practice 2.5 years ago and I figured I wouldn't get a refi due to lack of steady/predictable income. (My husband works with me and is my paralegal/office manager/tech guy so both of our incomes are tied together and fluctuate greatly). I also feel wary of government-backed loan modifications for some reason, as if they're a bad deal for the consumer and a good deal for the bank, or else why else would my mortgage company send me ""urgent"" FedEx packages all the time, trying to induce me to apply for a loan mod?

Another main reason I haven't refinanced is that if we get the loan below 78% of its original value, now that 5 years have passed, the PMI will fall off and we'll save $130 a month in payments. If we refinance or do a loan mod, we'll have to continue with the PMI and it will be another 5 years (at least, depending on the terms) until we could get rid of the PMI. So our current goal (after having paid off our cars and credit cards etc.) is to pay down the mortgage to where the PMI falls off, or, ideally, just keep paying it off. 

I have rented out the house before and lived in a cheap apartment (before I was married) while I was trying to decide whether to quit my law firm and start my own practice (which I eventually did). It is in a good location and I've gotten good tenants, but the rent never covered the mortgage. (It will come closer if there is no PMI). So originally my plan was just to hang onto the house and rent it out in the future. For now we like living here-- it's only a 1260-sq ft townhouse with two bedrooms but we are aspiring minimalists and have no problem with the space-- although if we have more children (I'm currently pregnant), it could get cramped. 

I have this eternal internal debate about whether paying off our mortgage is a smart thing or a dumb thing to want to do. 

PROs:

- Automatically gain 6.5% interest.
- PMI will fall off and we'll save an unnecessary $130 per month.
- Eventually have the peace of mind of truly owning our house.
- Eventually have no monthly payment other than property taxes and insurance.
- Eventually can rent it out as rental income (and we'd obviously have to pay to live somewhere else though).

CONS:

- The money we put towards the mortgage couldn't be easily retrieved if we need it (we do have some emergency and retirement savings).
- Perhaps there are better things to do with extra money. (I'm not really sure what that would be other than traveling more and spending more money, ha).
- Perhaps it's smarter to try to refinance and/or to just walk away from the house.

I guess it's the last ""con"" I get stuck on and would like your opinions about. If we plan to hang onto the house and pay it off as quickly as possible, are we being dumb for not trying to refi and bring the interest down? Or are we being dumb to hang onto a house worth nothing compared to when I bought it and should we just stop paying on the mortgage? We could live for a year or two rent free until the bank goes through the legal process and it's time to have to move out, and we could save up money during that time to start over. I'm not too worried about credit because we don't use it except for reward points that aren't that big of a deal, and we don't plan to use it. The whole buying a house experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and we would only do it again if we could pay in cash. The way our business is, we bring in a decent wage month to month and sometimes have ""windfalls"" due to cases settling or a big client etc. Right now we save that money for retirement and future business expenses/taxes but in the future we could use that ""windfall"" money (anything that we don't count on bringing in monthly to pay the business/personal bills) to make a big purchase.",finance,1400697050

I am moving to Hong Kong for work within the next 2 months and would like to make sure I have everything in order before I go.

**Student Loan: $500** (44K left to pay off 5% interest rate)

**Gas/entertainment/food/etc: $650**

however I moved home after school and was able to save for a year rent free. Once I move I will be paying rent, I am estimating $750 - 900 /month

My first though is that when I go I will not have need for a car anymore, so I will sell that before I leave. I know the $650/ month on gas /entertainment will be reduced quite a bit as well. 

I no longer use any credit cards and only spend the cash that I have, I keep one incase of emergency, but don't really use it.

personalfinance,"24, employed, but confused","Hey everyone, I've been really excited to post here since I read about it. I'm in a decent financial state day-to-day, but my student loans are a constant cloud over my head and I've also gotten a bit of credit card debit (largely because I'm an idiot and money burns a hole in my pocket). Here are the basics-

Employed since May 2013, averaging about $1960 a month after taxes. I have very little in my savings, around $500, because I just quit a job to take a new one and forfeited my vacation pay. This put me $950 in the hole.

I had more in savings but purchased a car in January that was better on gas and more reliable, and my monthly gas and car payment now about equal out to what I was paying in gas before. My car payment is $213 a month because with my credit score of 725 I was able to get a decent rate for a used car. 

I owe around $2,400 in credit card debt. I always paid this off every month which is why I have decent credit at my age, but essentially I was stupid and started spending amounts beyond what I could pay every month because I wasn't paying attention to how much I really put on here. I currently live with my dad so I am planning on paying this off in the next 2-3 months in large chunks since I do not pay rent. 

I'm wondering if I should transfer this to a credit card with 0% APR on balance transfers.

The next part is the most fun- my student loans. I had a full academic scholarship for tuition, but between room and board in Boston for 4 years I have a decent amount of debt. This was including money for rent/food/activities when I moved out of the dorms, I didn't have parents that could help me and it was expensive to live in a large city but I think the scholarship I got was the best offer. I pay $550 a month in loans, with my father helping me with $150 towards that. I want to refinance my private loans, which amount to $38,000, but no one seems willing to do it without a cosigner. Any advice for that would be great, they really screwed me on the interest rate for the second loan I took. My gov't loans are easy enough to change payments on, and I wish I knew what to do with private.

That leaves me $1387 monthly to fool around with. $300 or so ends up going to gas for driving and commuting, and I give myself around $100 a week for food/entertainment. My current plan is to push it all to getting rid of credit card debt ASAP, then start building up savings again and hopefully moving out if I can find a rent I can afford (which I think would be around $500 utilities not included). 

In short- what am I doing right/wrong? Should I get a card with no APR on transferred balances, what do I do about my private loans, and and how much should I try to cut down on food/entertainment spending?

personalfinance,TSP &amp; Roth IRA questions,"I'm a federal employee in my late 20s with a few quick questions.  So I currently have a Roth IRA with some money in it from a prior job. I have been contributing 5.5k / year to this for the last few years, including since starting work for the feds. When I took my current job I opted to take some percentage of my salary each pay period and put it in a TSP account, too. My employer matches this amount up to a point.  

First question: when I signed up for the TSP account I didn't change the default allocation, so all my $ is in the ""g""  fund which is low yield government securities. This is not ideal for a late 20s guy, so I'm planning to move it all to the ""2050 L"" fund which as I understand it is a changing allocation that starts off riskier and higher yielding but becomes more conservative as it approaches the year 2050, my approximate retirement time. Any reason not to do this? 

Second question: does it make sense to have some money in a ""traditional"" aka pre tax account and some in a Roth IRA? Or should I consolidate all my money into either a Roth or traditional account? 

Third question: 

TSP has a Roth option. Assuming I decide I want to go with a Roth option, should I switch my Roth IRA from fidelity to a TSP Roth IRA?  If not,  can /should I move my Roth money to my traditional tsp account? 

Final question: the max I can contribute each year to retirement accounts is 17,500? Or is it $5, 500? For some reason I have been contributing 5.5k to my Roth IRA because I thought that was the max.

personalfinance,Step-by-Step Guide to 401(k) Fund Selection,"Employer-sponsored retirement accounts are a great way to end up with more money when you're ready to retire.  401(k) plans are the most common type, but there are also 403(b) plans for the public sector and non-profits, 457 plans for government employees, the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees, and a few other choices.  Beyond the huge tax advantages, these plans have much higher contribution limits than an IRA and the possibility of employer matching contributions.  Sometimes, the only way to save enough for retirement (e.g., 15-20% of your income) is to use an employer-sponsored plan in addition to an IRA.  Unfortunately, many plans have limited investment options with higher expenses.

This guide's goal is to help you pick funds in your employer plan by following the /r/personalfinance (or Bogleheads) investment philosophy.  If anything here confuses you, hit the background materials at the end of this post.

******

### First Principles

Our overall approach is to optimize fund choices across several competing factors.  These are in rough order of importance, but sometimes these factors are going to conflict with each other.  We want:

1. Employer matching (as much as possible)
2. A diversified portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds
3. Mostly domestic stocks and some international stocks
4. Reduced costs by choosing funds with lower expense ratios
5. Passively managed index funds rather than actively managed mutual funds

### Know When to Punt

There is one additional tool at our disposal: most people have the ability to open an IRA with similar tax advantages and good fund choices.  So, in some cases, we're going to decide to skip one or two investment types and acquire those separately in an IRA.

So, if you find yourself with a bad option or two when going through these steps, don't panic.  Do the best you can and the last step discusses how to fix problems.

### Costs (Expense Ratios)

The expense ratio (ER) of a fund is the total percentage of your investment used each year for administration and other costs.  The ""net"" ER is the number that matters because that's the amount you're actually being charged.

What makes a good ER for a fund?  For domestic stock funds in the US, an ER below 0.1% is great, below 0.25% is good, below 0.5% is fair, and below 1% is sometimes the best you can manage in an expensive plan.  If you find yourself much above 0.2% then once you've maximized your employer matching, you should probably max out your savings in an IRA before you max out your 401(k).  This being said, even if you are limited to expensive funds above 1% ER, it's still almost always a better choice to max out your IRA and 401(k) before using a taxable account.  Beyond the enormous tax advantages, you can always move your money after leaving your job and your employer plan may also improve in the future.

Generally speaking, cheap international funds tend to have ERs about 3x higher than domestic funds and small-cap and bond funds tend to be about 1.5-2x higher in ER than large-cap stock funds.  Expensive funds tend to have an ER around 0.75% to 1.5% regardless of the type.

Finally, try very hard to avoid funds that have transaction fees or sales charges (also known as loads or commissions).

### The Steps

## 1. Research your plan options

Get a complete list of the funds available in your plan.  You will need the fund name, the ticker symbol (a five letter code), and the ER for that fund in *your* plan.  You may have to read the prospectus or search on the Internet to find out more about each fund if the fund names are not descriptive enough.

**SIDEBAR: TARGET DATE FUNDS AND BALANCED FUNDS**

If your plan offers target date funds with an expense ratio that is comparable to or better than the other options in your plan, you should consider using it as your sole investment in your plan to lower your costs and/or keep things simple.  Target date funds allocate across both domestic and international stock markets.  They also include a bond allocation that slowly increases over time as you approach the target date (of retirement).  They're intended to be the only fund you use within a plan.

Two very good target date fund families are the TSP Lifecycle funds and the Vanguard target date funds.  The TIAA-CREF Lifecycle Index Series is also good.  Other target date funds tend to be more expensive and/or include actively managed funds, but they might still be the best choice in some plans.

There are also balanced funds that may be worth considering because they are diversified like target date funds although they don't increase the bond allocation over time.  Some good options include:

- Fidelity Four-in-One Index Fund is similar to a target date 2035 fund
- Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund is similar to a target date 2030 fund
- Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund and Vanguard Balanced Index Fund are similar to a target date 2020 fund
- Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth Fund is similar to a target fund for someone in retirement

Most other balanced funds tend to be more expensive and/or include actively managed funds.

**END SIDEBAR**

If you haven't selected a target date fund or a balanced fund, continue on below.

## 2. Decide on your Bond Allocation

You need to decide what percentage you want to hold in bonds and what percentage in stocks.  This is a complex topic, but a simple approach is this: If you're a conservative investor, subtract your age from 100 or 110 and allocate that percentage to stocks.  If you're an aggressive investor, subtract your age from 130 or 120 and allocate that percentage to stocks (cap at 100).  The remainder is your bond allocation.  While some young and aggressive investors do decide to leave out bonds, note that most target date funds always include at least 10% bonds even for investors very far from retirement.

If you're uncertain about your bond allocation, take the [Vanguard Investor Questionnaire](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) and use the resulting bond allocation recommendation.

## 3. Bonds

We ideally want to allocate the entire bond allocation to a Total Bond Market index fund with a low expense ratio.  Here is a rough ranking of the various options to consider for this:

- Total Bond Market index fund
- The lowest cost intermediate-term bond fund
- The lowest cost bond fund

Note that a money market or sweep account is not a suitable alternative.  Those options won't earn enough interest to keep up with the rate of inflation.

## 4. US Stocks

This is going to be the largest percentage of your overall allocation.

Take your stock allocation and multiply it 70%.  We ideally want to allocate this amount to a US Total Stock Market index fund with a low expense ratio.  Here is a rough ranking of the various options to consider for your US stock allocation:

- US Total Stock Market index fund
- A mix of index funds that [approximate the US Total Stock Market](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market)
- A good large-cap index fund (e.g., an S&amp;P 500 index fund)
- The lowest cost US mutual fund choice(s), ideally averaging out to Morningstar large size category and the Morningstar blend style category.

If you end up on the last option and your plan only has growth and value funds, you can approximate a blend style fund by combining equal proportions of growth and value.  Because large-cap stocks constitute about 80% of the US stock market, you also want to try to only use small-cap and mid-cap funds for about 20% of your US stock allocation.

## 5. International Stocks

Take your stock allocation and multiply it by 30%.  We ideally want to allocate this amount to a Total International Stock Market index fund with a low expense ratio.  Here is a rough ranking of the various options to consider for this:

- Total International Stock Market index fund
- A mix of index funds that [approximate the Total International Stock Market](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_international_stock_market) (75% developed and 25% emerging is reasonably close)
- A good developed markets international index fund
- The lowest cost international mutual fund choice(s)

In a worst-case scenario, it's acceptable to fall short of 30%, but see the ""Fixing Problems"" section below first.

## 6. Fixing problems

Now, if you have a great employer plan, you're basically done at this point.  If, however, some of the funds that you had to pick weren't index funds, had high expense ratios, or weren't quite right, then consider following these steps:

1. Open an IRA if you don't already have one.  Good options include Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab.
2. Take the worst fund from your 401(k) and leave it out of your 401(k).
3. Replace that fund with a better choice from your IRA.
4. Repeat #2 and #3 if needed.

Ideally, you want to do this while [preserving the overall allocation you want](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation_in_multiple_accounts), but sometimes that will be difficult.  If the fund you're trying to replace is a US stock fund, it's likely that you'll only be able to partially replace it because US stocks are the largest percentage of our allocation.  Do your best and just contribute as much to both an IRA and a 401(k) as you can.  It doesn't have to be perfect.

If your income exceeds the limit for deductible contributions to a Traditional IRA then it may be disadvantageous to use this approach *if it would mean contributing less to your 401(k) plan* because it might increase your taxable income.

When fixing problems via a separate IRA, there are two big things that you don't want to do:

1. Leave employer match on the table.
2. Contribute less to retirement than you wanted to contribute before running into bad choices.  In virtually all cases, tax-advantaged savings trumps poor choices.

Today I get a letter from FedLoan Servicing (myfedloan.com) that they have taken over my loan. The amount they are showing is substantially lower but I am assuming it's due to the interest being removed from when my loans were in default status? 

As of right now I owe ~$5800 between two loans (one subsidized, one ubsubsidized), they're wanting me to make the $100 payment each month and it splits between the two loans.

The reason that so many people have given up looking for work is because the labor market is so dire at the moment. 

A large proportion of the people that have given up looking for work, have given up because there are no decent jobs available. 

What is the point of working if it does not cover the additional costs of child care, transport, taxes etc.?

U6 Unemployment which includes people forced to work part time instead of full time and a small number of discouraged workers is at 12.3%. 

If the US used the same metrics as Europe does, the official US unemployment rate would be 11.5%. 

If all discouraged workers, who have given up looking for work because there are no decently paid jobs out there, are included the unemployment rate is now TWENTY FOUR per cent and rising. 

This level of 24% is historically unprecedented (it didn't even get that high during the 1930's Great Depression).   

Just to get within the upper historical normal range the real unemployment rate needs to drop by about 9%. It will be a very long time indeed before the labor market shows any measurable improvement in the US. The real unemployment number needs to get back to 15% or lower for normal labor market conditions to prevail and it is still moving in the wrong direction.

The labor market will be NEVER improve given current government and Federal Reserve policies which are currently actively discouraging job creation and destroying jobs.

Charts and historical statistics http://ian56.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/the-real-47-per-centers-proportion-of.html

The dire situation in the labor market is compounded by the fact that living standards of the middle class have been eroded over the last 14 years and there are no returns on investments so people just cannot afford to retire early and more cannot even afford to retire when they reach 65. 

Around 4 million more people over the age of 54 are now in employment compared to the start of 2009. Which basically leaves no jobs for everyone else, despite the fact that the working age population (between the ages of 16 and 65) is growing by about 2 million every year. No wonder people can't find a decent job. 

Then we have the increasing problems with the reduced rate of new business start ups. The number of new business start ups has been decreasing by 10% a year since 2009 and the average number of people employed in those start ups in the first year has declined by over 30%. If you do not get a high rate of new business start ups you will not have the feedstock to get the businesses that employ significant numbers of people in the future.

Then we have the problem that of the few jobs that are being created, the vast majority of them have been low paid or minimum wage type jobs (jobs that pay around $20,000 a year or less) and very few have been well paid jobs ($50,000+ type jobs). Recently up to 87% of the new jobs created have been in the low paid category. How are people going to pay for childcare, transport etc. out of $20k or less? It's just not worth it.

America already has the highest proportion of low paid workers among the 30 or so developed countries and the problem is getting even worse.",finance,1400755761

personalfinance,Help! I need advice about a second home.,"My wife and I both owned homes when we met each other and we currently live in the home I purchased.  For some time now we were renting out her house to friends and that worked out well enough but now they have moved on.  My wife feels strongly that we should sell the house, but she purchased the house at the peak of the market and the house is worth much less than we paid.  Her parents helped with a down payment and if we sell we will still owe them a good chunk of cash too.  Also our interest rate on that home is 6% currently so I know we are paying much more than we should have to.

The house has been trouble with us already forcing us to spend money to replace her main water line, roof, and furnace.  We have gotten feedback that our asking price is too high but it is already much lower than I would like.  Meanwhile the house costs us money every month because I have a friend staying there at discounted rent only covering about half the mortgage.

I feel like it would be worth it to take a risk renting the property out.

personalfinance,A story of buying property young: rental property and student loans.,"Hi folks--

I had an interesting experience with a rental property over the last few years that I thought a few of you might find interesting and useful.

**tl;dr: Bought rental house after graduating from undergrad, held for 3.5 years, sold and used proceeds to payoff all outstanding debt.**

In late 2007, when I was but a wee sophomore in college, my parents bought a rental home near my campus. 4 beds, 2 baths. I moved in, and was compensated with cheap rent for finding tenants and managing the property. Given that it was 2007, the property was purchased at an inflated price of $297k (probably worth $265).

I graduated in 2009, found a decent job ($40k/yr), and continued to live in the property with 3 roommates. By 2010, however, my parents were itching to unload the property. My dad, with the time-tested ""real-estate is always a good investment"" advice, sold it to me. Given that I had lived in the house for 4 years for pocket change, I bought it from him for his purchase price + renovations, or $305k. The property was worth $285k. At 22, I didn't know how to negotiate with my father, nor am I sure even now if I should have. More on this later.

In 2013, I moved out of the property to a trendy apartment with my fiancee, and rented the house to my sister, who was finishing her degree at the same school. She and I operated on the same system that my dad and I did (her managing, me cutting her a deal on rent), and that worked well. Both of us are financially conscious accountants, but there was a risk here of family fallout that I didn't fully comprehend.

In early 2014, as the sister prepared to graduate, I decided to sell the property. I am enrolling in an MBA program out of state this fall, and it didn't make sense to manage the property from afar. By chance, I mentioned that I was looking to sell the property to a mentor, and after a month of hard negotiating, we closed the deal. Because we didn't use realtors (only attorneys to review the standard contract), I saved $20k on the sale (seller pays all realtor costs in my state). The price on the contract said $298k, but without realtor's fees the price was effectively $318k. 

After closing, I walked out with a check for $30k. Over the next week, I paid off all outstanding student loans ($20k remaining of an original $55k) and my car loan ($6k). The only debt I have on the books now is a student loan that I'm pretty sure the government screwed up--the interest rate is 0.06%. Oops on their part, but I'll take the free money. 

Needless to say, I consider this endeavor a success. However, there are several lessons learned that I think are worth sharing:

* Don't be house-poor. It was a miracle I qualified for the loan in 2010--I had no business owning that kind of property with my salary. Although rental income supplemented my income, I was at my tenants' mercy. 

* Don't do business with family. Whether my hesitation to negotiate with my father, or managing my sister, family has a strange way of interfering with what should be straightforward business dealings. If you can avoid it, don't do it.

* When selling property, try to do it yourself first. You don't need to put up a for sale by owner sign--just start mentioning it to friends and acquaintances a few months before you sign with a realtor. Plus you get the fun of learning to negotiate yourself.

* Read *Getting to Yes: Principles of Negotiation* before negotiating, and learn as much about the property as possible. Even though the buyer was much older, wealthier, and more experienced than me, I still came out of the deal feeling successful. Because of my intimate knowledge of the property and the neighborhoods around it, I was able to point to obvious comparables. Additionally, I learned how to negotiate without being an ass--the buyer and the book I mentioned taught me a lot. Hell, this is worth a whole separate write up.

If I had to re-do the whole experience, there are things that I would change. Namely, a few of the bullets above. However, I think the investment and learning overall turned out well. Especially now that I am debt free :).

Hope this helps someone, and happy to answer any questions.

**EDIT**
A few points of clarification, particularly to address the valid concerns of U/BrainSturgeon and u/gconcern:

* I don't consider this post advice, except for the bullet points at the bottom. I took a *huge and somewhat uneducated* risk, and it paid off well. I should have clarified, but my dad's advice that ""real-estate is always a good investment"" is terrible. Real estate is an investment, and like any investment, there are risks. The purpose of this post is to highlight some of the risks that I didn't see at time of purchase so that others who may consider a similar situation understand.

* If you do buy property, don't expect an increase in value in such a short time period. When I bought, I expected to hold it for at least 10 years, especially considering that I was buying at an inflated price. 

* A better title for this post, per u/BrainSturgeon, is **Betting on Black: How good luck can outweigh poor investing.**",finance,1400772023

Moreover the price does matter. A price increase gets people interested. The last time we had a huge price increase, the number of people on this subreddit exploded. We went from a tiny community to a huge one. No offense, but this explosion was way greater than the nascar increase and exposure. 

Price generates interest. Most importantly it generates interest in people CREATING THINGS. This is the most important thing for this community right now. We need infrastructure. We need people in or outside the community to innovate and create wonderful things for dogecoin.

People are going to be utterly essential as consumers‹what I call regenerative consumers, however, not just swill pails.""","&gt; Automation is with us. There is no question about it. Automation was inevitable to intellect. Intellect was found to diferentiate out experience continually and to articulate and develop new tools to do physically repeated tasks. Man is now no longer essential as a worker in the fabulously complex industrial equation. Marx’s worker is soon to become utterly obsolete. Automation is coming in Russia just as it is here. The word worker describing man as a muscle-and-reflex machine will not have its current 1961 meaning a decade hence. Therefore, if man is no longer essential as a worker we ask: ""How can he live? How does he acquire the money or credits with which to purchase what he needs or what he wants that is available beyond immediate needs?"" At the present time we are making all kinds of economic pretenses at covering up this overwhelming automation problem because we don’t realize adequately the larger significance of the truly fundamental change that is taking place in respect to man-in-universe. As automation advanced man began to create secondary or nonproductive jobs to make himself look busy so that he could rationalize a necessity for himself by virtue of which he could ""earn"" his living. Take all of our bankers, for example. They are all fixtures; these men don’t have anything to do that a counting machine couldn’t do; a punch button box would suffice. They have no basic banking authority whatsoever today. They do not loan you their own wealth. They loan you your own wealth. But man has a sense of vanity and has to invent these things that make him look important.

&gt; ....

&gt; The vast industrial complex undertakings and associated capital investments are today so enormous and take so long to inaugurate that they require concomitantly rapid regenerative economics to support them. The enterprise must pay off very rapidly in order to be able to refund itself and obtain the economic advantage to inaugurate solution of the next task with still higher technical advantage. In that regenerative cycle of events, the more consumers there are the more the costs are divided and the lower the individual prices. The higher the frequency of the consuming the more quickly the capital cost can be refunded, and the sooner the system is ready for the next wave of better technology. So man is essential to the industrial equation as a consumer‹as a regenerative consumer, a critical consumer, a man who tasting wants to taste better and who viewing realizes what he views can be accomplished more efficiently and more interestingly. The consumer thus becomes a highly critical regenerative function, requiring an educational system that fosters the consumer’s regenerative capacity and capability.

&gt; ....

&gt; Every time we educate a man, we as educators have a regenerative experience, and we ought to learn from that experience how to do it much better the next time. The more educated our population the more effective it becomes as an integral of regenerative consumer individuals. We are going to have to invest in our whole population to accelerate its consumer regeneration. We are going to be completely unemployed as muscle-working machines. We as economic society are going to have to pay our whole population to go to school and pay it to stay at school. That is, we are going to have to put our whole population into the educational process and get everybody realistically literate in many directions. Quite clearly, the new political word is going to be investment. It is not going to be dole, or socialism, or the idea of people hanging around in bread lines. The new popular regenerative investment idea is actually that of making people more familiar with the patterns of the universe, that is, with what man has learned about universe to date, and that of getting everybody inter-communicative at ever higher levels of literacy. People are then going to stay in the education process. They are going to populate ever increasing numbers of research laboratories and universities.

&gt; As we now disemploy men as muscle and reflex machines, the one area where employment is gaining abnormally fast is the research and development area. Research and development are a part of the educational process itself. We are going to have to invest in our people and make available to them participation in the great educational process of research and development in order to learn more. When we learn more, we are able to do more with our given opportunities. We can rate federally paid-for education as a high return, mutual benefit investment. When we plant a seed and give it the opportunity to grow its fruits pay us back many fold. Man is going to ""improve"" rapidly in the same way by new federally underwritten educational ""seeding"" by new tools and processes.

&gt; Our educational processes are in fact the upcoming major world industry. This is it; this is the essence of today’s educational facilities meeting. You are caught in that new educational upward draughting process. The cost of education will be funded regeneratively right out of earnings of the technology, the industrial equation, because we can only afford to reinvest continually in humanity’s ability to go back and turn out a better job. As a result of the new educational processes our consuming costs will be progressively lower as we also gain ever higher performance per units of invested resources, which means that our wealth actually will be increasing at all times rather than ""exhausted by spending."" It is the ""capability"" wealth that really counts. It is very good that there is an international competitive system now operating, otherwise men would tend to stagnate, particularly in large group undertakings. They would otherwise be afraid to venture in this great intellectual integrity regeneration.

&gt; I would say, then? that you are faced with a future in which education is going to be number one amongst the great world industries, within which will flourish an educational machine technology that will provide tools such as the individually selected and articulated two-way TV and an intercontinentally net-worked, documentaries call-up system, operative over any home two-way TV set.

How long until it shows on my credit report that my student loans are out of default?

Bitcoin,Famous quote by Woodrow Wilson after signing the Federal Reserve into existance,"""I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."" -Woodrow Wilson

Edit: Here is a different version of the quote that actually has a legitimate source:
""Yes. The Federal Reserve Act, which I signed, allowed our system of credit to become too concentrated. The growth of the nation and all our activities are in the hands of a few men who, even if their action be honest and intended for the public interest, are necessarily concentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money is involved. We have restricted credit, we have restricted opportunity, we have controlled development, and we have come to be one of the worst ruled, controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world—a ­government run by the opinion of small groups of dominant men.""

• Cited as the answer to the question ""Any regrets?"" in Business Management Daily December 28, 2012 entry Woodrow Wilson: ‘All big men are dreamers’

Bitcoin,FT's Izabella Kaminska on Bitcoin QE: should the block reward go up to subsidize mining hash rate / difficulty?,"""Here’s one for the FT Alphaville Blockchain log.

It seems key bitcoin foundation member Gavin Andresen has finally figured out that the cryptocurrency’s competitive transaction fee may be dependent on a constant capital transfer from real money systems.

And, more specifically, that when people stop subsidising miners with “seigniorage” revenue, they’ll either have to:

1) Hike fees to compensate miners for managing the currency and not bailing out. [Surely you mean interest rates? - Ed]

2) Make the thing much less costly to run by making the hash rate easier, something which would inevitably expand the money supply.

Or…

3) Open the system to third-party applications (like notary services), which at least have a chance of directing all that vested ASIC miner power towards something more useful, and something which people are prepared to pay for.

This, via Coindesk, (from last week) is a keeper:

*Transaction fees could “rise and rise to the point where only rich people can transact” if block sizes aren’t increased, according to Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation. Speaking at the Bitcoin2014 conference today, Andresen warned that if steps aren’t taken to either increase the rate at which blocks are created or to persuade miners to include more transactions in each block (therefore increasing their size), transaction fees could skyrocket.*

Which, of course, is tantamount to a call for Bitcoin QE from a key Bitcoin FOMC member.

Quick, someone alert the Winklvii! They’ll need to top up the system sharpish.""

investing,I need to find startups quick to invest 500K. Yes...I know how fake that sounds.,"(long-time redditor; throwaway account)

I'm very, very lucky. A few years ago I was an early investor in a friend's startup, which recently got acquired. I have just received over 1.5 million dollars in cash. 

(Yes, I am a bit freaked out. No, I'm not changing my personal spending habits for a while.)

Now Uncle Sam (I'm American) is giving me a huge incentive to immediately reinvest this money in other startups. If I pay taxes as is, I'll lose about a third of it. But there are federal and state exemptions for startup funders which can drop my taxes down to around 5%. 

To get the exemptions, I need to roll this money over into other small businesses for at least 2 more years. And I have to invest before mid-July.

I'm not a seasoned pro. I'm a lucky newcomer. I don't know how people find and evaluate good candidates. Since my goal is asset protection and not growth, I'd like to find the more conservative opportunities in this space. I assume that means Series B rather than Seed rounds, if they let me participate.

The companies must be C corporations (not mom-and-pop S corps) worth less than $50 million, and they must issue me new stock.

I'd like to do this with half a million to one million of my money, depending on my confidence in the companies.

I don't have a mentor, or a network of peers in the same position. It may be a long shot, but maybe someone in this community can give me some competent, unbiased guidance. 

You can pitch me if you want, but understand that in this context it may be taken with a grain of salt.

My IRA is at $44000, out of which $10000 is Roth.
We want to add an extension to our house. The contractor bid $35000. We will negotiate it down to $30000.
Based on the interest rate and my credit score, If I borrow $30000 as home improvement loan, my monthly payment is going to be ~ $275 a month.
I forgot to mention, our Mortgage payment is $1867.
I was wondering how should I manage the cost of borrowing the $30000 with my current salary.
a) Take money out from IRA and pay off the car. This will free the $220 a month to pay for the Home Improvement loan Monthly installment.
b) Withdraw everything from the IRA and use that to finance the construction?
c) Hybrid: Withdraw half from the IRA and remaining from the bank and use that to fund the construction?

If bitcoin were not safe, and in fact a tool by the NSA in conjunction with the FEDs, then it would, given it's worldwide success, hand over the control of the worldwide money supplies to: well, the FED, which is really the only way that could possibly stop the impending collapse of the dollar as the world reserve currency, given US-American politics and the US-American moral and ethic image-loss of recent times (snowden leaks, world politics etc)

Any hardcore tech geeks here who can exclude this scenario?

but what if AMD and Intel, the chips all the world's computers run on don't produce random numbers?

The problem I have with this is that I have zero experience with stocks, bonds, anything like that. To be frank, I'm afraid of the stock market.

I need a reliable car as I am a regional sales rep and commute anywhere from 5-45 mins away (locations change every month). Was borrowing my girlfriends car and got into a wreck that totaled the car. I have the cash to reimburse what her family paid for it ($1700) plus fix the other guys car (my fault) in order to keep their insurance from going up or being cancelled. This will deplete my emergency cash fund.

My bills are cheap, around $1200 for everything including student loans. My new job's pay structure is confusing as I am 100% commission but it is pretty easy to make $3k before taxes (min req by employer) with good months netting $5k. Have worked there 5 months, made $5k the past few months which sets my schedule up to continue making good money if I put in the hours. 

With needing a car ASAP , I need to finance a car. My credit is only a 630. My question is, should I buy a car for around $5k and pay it down within a few months, or spend around $15k for a newer, low mileage used vehicle that I shouldn't have to worry about breaking down? 

Everyone is advising I go the cheap route but I feel confident with my income's stability and would rather pay more money for something more reliable. With my string of bad luck in these past two weeks, I am very scared of financing a cheap car only to have trouble with it. Either way I plan on having the car paid off within a year so my high interest rate doesn't kill me.",finance,1400893256

personalfinance,Car Financing Advice Needed!,"In February, bought a used 2010 Altima with 37k miles. Interest rate is 21% (i'm climbing up from bankruptcy) and the payment is 436 a month on 17k balance. Almost 3k of that was due to a stupid additional warranty which I got the dealer to refund. Good news my principal is now 14k or so, bad news, I am still being charged that 436 a month. This payment is making money tight but it is way too soon to refinance or trade in with my credit. I guess my question is this. If I wanted to either a) refinance it or b) trade it in towards something used next year (I am thinking a scion xb) how can I set myself up for the best possible outcome ie: lower payment (275-325 range), better apr, etc. And as a woman, how can I make sure i don't get jerked around?",finance,1400895190

personalfinance,How Do I Find/Do I Need a Financial Planner?,"Lately, I find myself with more and more financial questions, and little answers. As I've gone through the process of buying a house, paying on loans, and working on my taxes, I feel so unsure about so much.

My wife and I have been married 3 years and both work full time. Although we make good money, we always seem to be in that 'if we just had a little more a month, we'd be comfortable' boat.

We've talked lately about finding a financial planner/counselor, but I have no idea where to start or if I need one. Let me throw some of my questions out there and see what reddit would recommend.

Things I'd like help with:

Taxes: I've changed my W-2 w/ my company each time, but I still keep owing bc they don't take enough federal. How can I be sure they are?

Loans: My wife and I have student loans. They're seperate and we pay  $800 a month on them. That leaves us very cash poor, but lowering payments would only drag them out. What can we do?

Investments: I know I should be but no clue where to begin.

Retirement: My wife and I both have plans through our employers but know little about them.

These are examples of where we are. Its tough to think about trusting a third party but we need help. I have a monthly budget that we do our best to stick to, but I'm wondering if there's room to do more.

dogecoin,Greed and regretting charitable donations and tips could destroy the Dogecoin community...,"To my fellow Shibes,
We are quickly approaching the moon! To the point where Dogecoin will be both respected, and valuable, we are not only investors, but entrepreneurs. Someday very soon Dogecoin may be worth $0.50 or even $1.00. Our wallets stuffed with countless coins will be envied. Most will be grateful for what has happened, but some may regret the very thing that gives me pride in the Dogecoin community… Charity.
A 5,000 Doge tip today is worth around $2.00 but if the price were to spike to $0.50 that turns into $2,500. You just gave away $2,500. Some would laugh, but many will regret, they will be upset and destroy the cheer and good will of the Dogecoin community. I fear it is going to be greed and regretting tips and charitable donations that could destroy us. We could become /r/bitcoin who are full of curmudgeons, some of whom have lost great fortunes by giving coins away before the spike.
I foresee this bleak future and urge all of my fellow Shibes to brace yourself for this future. Keep tipping, keep donating, and keep the spirit alive, don’t let greed destroy what we have created. 
Never regret.

personalfinance,Discretionary income check,"So, I have been looking at cutting costs lately, and was just wondering if I could get some feedback about how I stand as I think it is not good enough yet.

24, male, electrical engineer, Ohio  
Income(1): ~$50k/year   
401K(2): $10k/year   
Tax(3): $10k   
Rent(4): $729/mo = $8,748/year   
Utilities(5):~160/mo = $1,920/year   
Fuel(6): ~140/month = $1,680/year   
Car Loan(7): $2,500   
Car Insurance(8): $900/year   
Parking(9): $6.25/day = $1,560/year  
(Almost) Discretionary income: $12,692/year

I have not estimated my food costs accurately, however I know it is higher than it should be.  I am on a diet, already down ~45lb since December 2013 and working on the last 5-10lb.  As such, to make up for the lack of variety I have been buying more expensive food as that makes it significantly easier to stick it out.

After my bills are paid I have access to about 25% of my income for food, clothing, other savings (Roth, taxable), and other misc things.  I can estimate that when my lease is up it is likely I can save about $100/month on rent, another $100/month on fuel (will take the bus), car will be paid off and I can increase that 25% to almost 35%.  So, when the lease is up, car paid off, fuel goes down, I will have about 55% of my income either going to 401K, food+other misc, and other savings.  I have no debt other than car loan.  I pay credit cards off every billing cycle, no student loans, no mortgage.  Last note in this section, I have already put $5k into a Roth, and I may still put an additional $500 later this year.

I am under the (potentially false) impression this is not good enough.  I am looking to get into law school, so I would take on significant amount of debt, however with the increase in income (will be an engineer with  a law degree so I should have employers lining up to get me as a patent attorney) I should be able to pay the debt off in about a year and my income after that will be about double what I make now, perhaps more.

Anyway, the point of this wall of text: with how my finances look how do I compare with other people in this sub?  With my current income is there a more reasonable % I should be aiming at for discretionary income?  Yes, I am aware that discretionary income should also take food into account, I am not although I am working on finding out what that cost is already.

1) This includes parking reimbursement, bonus, and is rounded up.   
2) There is a flat 3% contribution from employer *not* taken into account.   
3) Approximate  
4) I plan on moving out to a cheaper apartment when the lease is up.     
5) Rounded up  
6) This is part of why I plan on moving to a different apartment, there is a 15 minute drive to the nearest bus stop then a 40 minute bus ride.  Instead, I drive ~20 miles each way every day.   
7) I could actually make no payments this year as I have been making like 3X the minimum payment, but I want this paid off before my birthday this year.  Technically a bad financial decision as the interest rate is like 2.9%, but I want to be debt free.   
8) I have less than 5 years driving experience, a 1 year old car, and a single male.  This will go down every year, but as it stands I have to just wait it out.   
9) This is part of my income.  I figured if I start to take the bus and this decreases, my income decreases with it so I might as well take this portion out of my income.

[EDIT]   
Utilities includes cell phone bill, I do not have cable, only internet, I downgraded to a basic phone to cut that down by $45 a month.  If there are other costs which you think should have been listed as a normal cost let me know, but I think I have cut most of my other costs out.",finance,1400939457

personalfinance,Looking for advice regarding a new car,"So here's my current situation. My current car has 110k miles and is a GMC. Right now it's going to need about 1.5-2k worth of repairs, and probably isn't worth much more than that for a trade in. 

I don't have much in savings, only a few grand. I have one student loan account at 6% which is sitting at about 5k. My net monthly income is about $4800 but after rent, bills, etc I have about $2k a month after that for discretionary income

My question is....should I spend a few grand on repairs now and save up to buy a used car in cash (looking for &lt;$16k), or should I avoid the repairs, trade in the car, and get financing for a used car (again, &lt;$16k).

My credit is good and I got a pre-approval offer for as low as 3.4%.

**My next question is** If I do go the car financing route, should I choose the higher interest perecent/lowest payment, or lowest interest rate/highest payment?

I was considering taking the highest interest rate with lowest payment because **I see myself being able to pay off the car within the next year with cash only** I just think it's a waste to spend $2k on repairs now with possibly more later, but maybe I'm wrong.

TL;DR: Should I finance a new car as opposed to dropping a couple grand in repairs? If so, should I just take the lowest monthly payment/highest interest rate? I know I can pay it off with cash within the next 1-1.5 years.

I Should add the financing is not fixed, so they will NOT take interest out regardless of early payments.

Also the financer is carmax.

I currently have no car payment. I live pretty fly by the moment, what I mean by this is, I spend money when I can.  I put about 250 a month in retirement, and always have at least 3k in my checking.


I am wanting to put down about 6k (including my trade-in) on a $35,000 Jeep.  



My credit score is 780+ so I should be able to get a 5 year loan at a relatively low interest rate, I'm hoping for 2.5%.



So what do you think?  Should I afford this car?  I know I ""CAN"", I have a stable job, I get commission checks every month (which will go straight into paying the car off, so I can reduce the 5 year or 6 year loan to 3-4), but should I?  This is going to be a roughly $550 payment each month, if I'm doing my math correctly - which I'm probably not and the reason I'm posting.

investing,"I have $10,000 that I want to invest short term (3-5 years). Looking for recommendations and advice.","Before anyone feels the need to tell me about making sure I have 6 months living expense saved or something along those lines, don't worry the 10,000 is not all of my savings. I live with my parents rent free and have been stashing away money in a savings account with an extremely low interest rate for too long. 

I am 20 years old, and have no student loan debt. I own my car (no car payments) and am not in any kind of debt at all. 

I know its good to start stashing away money for long term savings as early as you possibly can but I am more interested in something that is more short term (3-5 years) at the moment. My goal is to be able to own a home by the time I'm around 25 or so without a mortgage.

I am not interested in a high risk high reward scenario. I just want my money somewhere that is safe, is somewhere that I can freely access it in 3-5 years, and isn't wasting away in a savings account that isn't doing much more then a box under my mattress could. 

I welcome any advice since I am new with this. Thank you.",finance,1400983606
Bitcoin,"This sub is trash, and it's partly your fault.","With the recent rise of Darkcoin, I'm seeing much of the same material that I came to expect from Bitcoin detractors when it was breaking $100.

I'm sure you remember the type of nonsense. They never knew the first thing about Bitcoin. They thought it was a company, a bank, a fiat currency, or a Ponzi scheme. They made arguments that would make sense about any centralized system, showing just how little they knew. They were doing something I see happening here regularly: poisoning the well.

**Poisoning the well** is when someone spreads misinformation/disinformation repeatedly, without proof or substance that can be evaluated, leaving their audience's confirmation bias to do them and others a disservice. Poisoning the well preys on those who are not yet knowledgeable on a topic, giving them a negative first impression that is likely to discourage them from ever learning the facts on the matter. When someone tells a random person Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, do they demand hard evidence, or do they google ""Bitcoin scam"" that evening?

For all the bullshit this community has been offered by outside hostile interests, it is nothing short of shameful and hypocritical to inflict it on its kind. The purpose of Darkcoin is to promote coinjoin development, which has been stagnant for months. To the extent that it succeeds, it is offering a gift to cryptocurrency as a whole. To accept a gift and spit in the giver's face is to discourage further gifts. The sort of behavior we are witnessing will kill cryptocurrency, not by challenging the technology, but by manipulating gullible human beings who can be led like cattle.

It's important that we remember our roots. Our brains are stone-age technology, and we're now in the information age. Many of us take every precaution to protect our private keys, but not nearly enough to protect the soundness of our beliefs and preconceptions. Your mind is far more hackable than your system, and nobody else can secure it for you. It's your duty to ask for evidence, to ask questions, and to put your emotional responses and biases on hold, **if you care about what is true**, rather than what you're being fed.

business,business partnering (for a total newb with a startup idea)- what to avoid? how not to get screwed over?,"I have an idea for a business in my major US city - a type of business (let's call it X) that exists in LA and NYC, but not yet in my city. 

About me: I am an artist with little to no knowledge of anything 'business,' so please, ELI5. I am also not familiar with business lingo - so please don't be shy to even ELI&lt;1.

About X: X is a specialty company providing rental goods (that are large and need to be moved by able-bodied people) to a very specific niche community in my major US city.

I met for coffee with a former childhood mentor of mine, who very successfully runs an X company in another major city (that is not my own). I was expecting it to just be a 'brain picking' session. From the meeting though, she gave me 2 options: she introduced me to the steps on how to start my business on my own and also offered to partner with me (we did not discuss exact specifics on what exactly a partnership would entail of). I am assuming she'd like to partner to increase profits and to expand her empire. My mentor also suggested that my first step in 'beginning' (on either fronts) is to have coffee meetings to 'spread word' and to develop a greater idea of the market.

**1. How she explained that I begin on my own...**
I need a storage space for goods, a moving vehicle, and some staff (a GM and 2 movers). I have no money saved up. I have no family money either. Due to my brokeness - I was informed by my mentor that if I am to start up my own business I would need to take out a bank loan - which I NEVER want to do (already drowning on federal student loans) to cover the start up costs (the goods and the rent/purchase of a storage space - I intend to use Zip Van as the moving vehicle unless I find a reason not to). She also proceeded to explain to me that I would likely be rejected for a bank loan due to my young age (I am in my early 20s)... but perhaps they were just trying to sell me on the idea of partnering.

**2. Partnering...**
As I stated above - I'm not quite sure to what extent she will partner with me. She said she would provide the goods to be rented, which is already quite a huge contribution (costs for these goods would exceed $200k) She also suggested that I take her company's name, and just append my city's name to it. I am not sure what more they could provide - but I would love it if they also could provide financial support to cover the costs of the storage space. I also would need to clarify how the breakdown of profits would work. I would be the person to coordinate all the rentals top to bottom, pursue new clients, and manage the employees. I also had the idea to move into the storage space (loft apartment) and provide my share of 'rent' as my contribution to the startup capital.

I would like to partner because it feels like a huge jump start for my idea - but I am very afraid of being crushed and left out in the cold, once I set up a network for X in my city. I am flattered that my mentor thinks it's such a great idea but I am concerned that my involvement as a 'partner' is just a way to use me as a step into my community and to gather information that would ultimately be for their benefit and that they would just drop me. Also - I have a feeling if I don't take advantage of this opportunity - she will do it anyway, and/or get someone else from my city to team up... the idea is out of the bag now. 

If I do accept the partnership - I suppose a 'partnership agreement' in writing is what I need to propose... should I draft one? Or ask her to draft one? Then come to a compromise? What factors should I consider in it? Google searches have been giving me some ideas. Also - do I HAVE to take their name?

I also don't want to be 'general' manager of my city's branch. I want to be co-founder or some other title - I don't want her to be my boss. I want to be an indispensable and essential part of the company... not just another employee.

As you can tell - I really know nothing here. I am just want to make sure that I am protected and that it's all set up in a way that I don't have to worry about being screwed over because I'm a newb. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR** - Had an idea for a startup. Same type of company located in another city offered to partner. I would like to partner but am afraid of getting screwed over because I'm a total business newb. Help!",finance,1401033453

Bitcoin,"The manipulated reality of value and numbers in Bitcoin, money or any other asset.","This has been on my mind for some time now, I wonder what are the thoughts of the community about this.

One day as I was trading and looking at the exchange numbers a serious doubt had occurred in my mind.

As long as we trade on the exchange internal ""ledger"" anything is possible, there is no way to know if the numbers that we see are real, they can be manipulated in any way by the ones who have the access to the engine.

Unless a ""bank run"" on the exchange happens there is no possible way to know if the actual funds are even there. There is no way bitcoins can be traded directly from wallet to wallet so until we have decentralized p2p exchange solution we will always just have to trust the exchange on its legitimacy. 

Probably all exchanges and banks in the world can and do manipulate the numbers. The FED ""printing"" money or not is just a sick joke, because majority of FIAT is now in the form of computer numbers. If they want to ""print"" FIAT it is as easy as typing the numbers into a computer.

It is sickening to me to think that the reality of value is simply fake and can never be determined in any possible way.

I've been admitted to a university and because of some family/personal issues I'm being viewed as an independent by the FAFSA which normally includes your parents income until you're 24(I'm 20). 

This means that I get full aid with the measly $12,000 that I earned last year, and that the university will essentially be paying for everything. I'll also be getting a Pell grant of $6,000 a year to help out. 

Just another note, I currently live in my van and so living expenses consist of Food, Gas, and Insurance. I spend about $120 on food, $48 on insurance and $60-$100. I live in California.

My real question is about a $5,000 loan that's being offered to me as a part of the aid. Would it be wise to take the loan and pay it off for the potential credit boost instead of just avoiding it?

personalfinance,"I'm starting university this fall. The school expects me to have an outstanding $4,800 this year after grants but before loans and work-study.

How should I spend/save in the next year?","After hearing how fortunate my school fees are so low from a friend who currently has $200,000 in student loan debt (jesus christ), I feel like now's the time to start thinking about finances.

My school expects me to spend $30,000 on tuition, housing (which includes meals), and books/supplies for the 2014-2015 school year.

I'm getting $25,200 in grants and scholarships. That leaves **$4,800** to take care of. My options:

* Federal Perkins Loan - up to $1,500 - 5% interest
* Federal Subsidized Direct Loan - up to $3,500 - 3.86% interest
* Work-Study - up to $4,000 

This summer, I'll have about $6,200 in savings after working my summer job. I don't need to pay for food or housing since I'll be living at home. I'll be generous and budget away $800 solely for clothes and dorm stuff this year, so I'll have **$5,400** by the time school starts.  

I don't plan on any big expenses in the future. I don't need to pay for medical coverage. I don't plan on buying a car for a long while since I'll have free/cheap public transportation in a college-town where everything's very close by. I ever want to get home, it'll be, like, $2 after getting as far as I can with the university's free public transportation.

**My question is: should I pay off everything ASAP? If not, what should I do with the money?** I would *greatly, greatly* prefer *not* having to work during school (working at my current job proves how sucky working is). In any case, my summer job will pay $15/hr and I don't expect to get paid better than $10/hr as an entering freshman under Work-Study. But, of course, I can't work my summer job during the school year. 

Of course, there are also scholarships available out there, and I plan on taking advantage of them throughout the summer and the school year.

During the all star race dogecoin was stable at around .00045, Josh started at the end of the pack and finished at the end.  An important point to note is that Josh did not crash, and you know why because neither did dogecoin.

personalfinance,Case Study: Paying Off a Mortgage in Full vs. Making Minimum Payments and Investing the Rest,"Personal finance gets a lot of question along the lines of ""I have x, should I use it to pay off debt. My hope is that the scenarios presented below will be helpful as a reference for people who are wondering whether to put extra money towards a mortgage or not, and as an illustration of how important compound interest is. It bears mentioning that the *general* trends hold for shorter-term loans (such as student loans), but the differences are smaller and the cross-over threshold may be moved.  

So: imagine Bob has 5K take home pay after expenses and a brand-new 300K 30 year fixed rate mortgage.  As fate would have it, Bob's Uncle Rich dies and leaves them a net of 300K after estate tax and the rest.  Bob is faced with a choice: invest their money (windfall +  income), or pay off the mortgage with the monthly payments, investing the remainder of their income and the whole windfall.  In either case, *any* money not going to the mortgage is invested in a new hypothetical portfolio where Bob gets a 5% annual rate of return.  For the calculations here, interest is compounded annually for both the mortgage and the portfolio.  

The tables below have 5 rows: how the mortgage is handled, what the up-front portfolio investment is, how much gets invested each month, the resulting portfolio at the end of 30 years, and which option has the advantage (and by how much).  Note that the Monthly Investment in the Pay Up Front option and the Up Front Investment in the Pay Monthly option do not change from one option to the next. Some numbers are rounded off by a dollar or two; the rounding did not impact the comparisons significantly.  

**Scenario 1: mortgage interest rate at 5% (same as portfolio)**

          |Pay Up Front | Return | Pay Monthly | Return

**TL;DR - compound interest can make a huge impact with small differences in interest rates. If interest rates between a loan and a portfolio are close, or the rate is higher for the loan, it's better to pay off the loan first. As the interest rate of the loan drops relative to the portfolio, however, the likelihood that keeping the debt makes more money in the long run increases, even though you end up paying much more in interest on the loan.**",finance,1401088567

personalfinance,Keep house as rental property or sell?,"Hello PF -

I currently own a house worth about $110k with a mortgage of $84k left at 4.5%. I'm looking at purchasing a foreclosure for $40k using an FHA 203k loan which will allow me to put $30k worth of work into the home for a total mortgage of $70k, leaving me with a home worth about $110k and an instant $40k in equity (sounds like a smart move to me, right?). I would plan on living in the newly remodeled house. With my current income, I would be able to pay both mortgages if I needed to pay them, however my question is: should I hold on to my current home and use it as a rental property (for what I could collect in rent, it would leave me with about $200 in income after paying the mortgage each month) or sell it? 

After taking out fees and misc. expenses, lets say I walk away from the table with $20k if I sell. My debts are: $11k on car (4% interest and the loan is upside down by about $2k), $5k on motorcycle (15% interest), $2k on personal loan (very high interest rate which I don't know off the top of my head), $30k in private student loan debt with a 6% interest rate (federal loans will eventually go away because of the wonderful public service loan forgiveness program!), I don't have any savings other than a few thousand that I would use at closing for the new home. So if I did sell, I could pay off a lot of debt. 

What would be the better option - rent or sell? If I sell, how should I spend the theoretical $20k to pay off debt and/or start an emergency fund? I should mention that I probably have excellent job security and insurance as a federal employee.

Thanks in advance!!

Edit: Thanks for the replies. After considering everything I think we agree the best route would be to sell the first house. Being in the second house vs the first would put me in a much better financial position overall. It would also allow me more room in my monthly budget to get a 15 year mortgage as opposed to a 30 year. Now the important question is, what should my strategy be for using the $20k??",finance,1401095236

litecoin,Why I don't have any litecoins.,"I've been thinking about this for a while now, not just because the price of LTC is teetering dangerously on the .02 precipice.

The bubbles/waves/whatever-you-want-to-call them that we've been experiencing up to this point have been almost entirely driven by hobbyists, speculators, and other small parties. It's exciting to try to ride the waves and watch other people chat about the future and guess which gimmick will trick the most noobs this week, but the $8-9 billion or whatever that's currently invested in cryptos across the board--and has been driving all this excitement--is chump change for the major financial players who are going to come into play.

When the big crypto rocket takes off, if it does at all, it won't be thanks to small fish, nerds, and Chinese speculators; it will be because of investment banks, hedge funds, retailers, and other parties with billions of dollars to put into play. Anybody who thinks that PayPal and Goldman Sachs are having serious discussions about Litecoin is kidding themselves. Here's an example of a conversation that's NOT going on right now, and never will:

* Investment banker 1: Well, Bitcoin seems to have a lot of momentum. It's stood up through quite a few serious tests, there are hundreds of millions of venture capital dollars currently at work to make it more useful/accessible, and the Fed is even coming out in some cases and saying that it's promising. It looks like a seriously useful financial tool that could make us a ton of money, and after all this news coverage and all these younger guys explaining it to me, it doesn't sound so crazy anymore. Do you think we should pick some up?

* Investment banker 2: Sure, of course. But $700 for a whole bitcoin? Seems kinda pricy, not to mention we can't use our graphics cards to mine it. Plus I was reading the BTC-e trollbox and they said that this thing called Litecoin is kinda like the silver to Bitcoin's ""gold"". So the way I figure, we should pick some of that up too, because Litecoin and Bitcoin are kinda ""price-linked"" the same way gold and silver are. Some of the hackers I've been in contact with say that .025 BTC/LTC is a pretty reasonable starting point, but if the Chinese get involved that might even go up to .05 or maybe .1 someday!

* Investment banker 1: Good thinking. When our friends swoop in with hundreds of billions of dollars and dwarf everybody who's been involved up until now, let's make sure we set aside maybe 25% to invest in Litecoin, and then another 10% for up-and-coming coins that are innovative in case one of them takes off. The Law of Variety teaches us that when something does something exceptionally well and has universal appeal, that there is always room for two or three other exact-same somethings to stay ""price-linked"", a little bit like silver and gold. Pass me that 7950, I want to start mining.

That's it. I don't know if there are any online retailers who accept Litecoin yet but my guess is that anybody who accepts LTC for products or as donations does so to spur LTC believers into parting with their coins, which are then quickly converted to BTC or USD. Bitcoin is world news, it has the brand and the audience, and if as we all hope and suspect the financial world starts taking cryptocurrency seriously, it will look towards Bitcoin, and not Dogecoin, Mazacoin, or Litecoin.",cryptocurrency,1401106661

Throwaway because on my main account I've talked publicly about my job.  I recently came into a life changing amount of money... The company I helped build from a few employees to hundreds just sold and I have millions of dollars that just landed in my accounts.  I have plenty of savings for any short term issues and almost all of the money is currently parked in the bank with most of it going to the financial advisers to invest.  I've hired financial advisers, a high net worth lawyer, accountant, paid tax, setup a trust with trustees I feel really good about, and bought a little bit of insurance.  Everything is on track.

Except that I'm starting to feel very nervous about deploying the money.  I 100% realize that sitting in the bank is the worst option but the timing of the market seems crazy.  I'm most interested in having the financial advisers get started but the stock market is at record highs... This feels like buying high, not low.  On top of that, I'm really interested in more real estate (I own a single building that's doing great for me but I bought it during the crash so its outperformed) but with the way the fed has been giving out money the real estate market seems really inflated and there is a lot for sale so its hard to find value, even on a NOI basis.

~~Here's where things get fuzzy. That gives $4482.14 left over for groceries, eating out, gas, clothing, etc. I'm...not really sure how the hell we're spending that much, which is what got me started on this in the first place. So while we're tracking everything this month to get an idea of what the budget numbers for those categories might look like, my current questions are:~~

**Insert Edit**
It's less fuzzy now, but a bit...embarrassing? Thank goodness for CSV and Excel downloads - here's the full story (I averaged March/April and projected May for a ballpark picture, so it won't add up exactly. This accounts for about $4100):

Petsitting	25

School lunch	50

Hobbies	60

Household	340.00 - Lowe's/Ikea/Home Depot...husband's aquarium project

Amazon	500.00

Costco	500.00

Walmart    100.00

Eating out	620.00

The Amazon/Costco/Walmart trifecta...yikes. A good chunk of Costco is really groceries, but without receipts there's no way to know exactly how that breaks down with Clothing, Gifts, Work-related expenses (I buy things for my classroom there often). 

And the eating out is insane. Enough.

Some of these categories are unusually high this time of year - kids sports goes to zero in August, entertainment was VERY high because of spring break and visitors, Household and Amazon are higher than ""normal"" because of the aquaponics project my husband got set up this spring, I stopped therapy, etc. And I definitely know that just being fully aware of what we're spending is going to make a huge dent in those last few categories - we really had gotten reckless. So now I have to figure out a reasonable budget based on what we were spending vs. what we **should be** spending.

**End Edit**

* I think we might be over-insured...we did that intentionally before he deployed, and because my job situation is never solid because of frequent moves - if I die, he will likely have to get out of the military, so even though my income isn't a huge factor, it will affect his, so I'm covered as well. I also think we pay too much for our life insurance - I weighed a whole lot more when this was done. How does getting your life insurance re-evaluated work? Am I risking higher premiums by being re-screened 5 years later but 70 pounds lighter? Is he risking higher premiums by being back from deployment, but 5 years older?

* Should I be cashing out IBM stock to pay off the 7+% student loans? (The stock was a gift to my parents when they got married and assigned to me when they got divorced - that's why the single company)

* When I find that missing money, where are my priorities? The 7% student loans or maxing out an IRA for me and a TSP for him? (TSP is like a 401K but no matching for active duty, from what I can tell).

* I did the money.gov booklet with the retirement calculators, and it came out that I should be saving 9.24% and he should be saving 9.98%. These seem low considering we haven't really saved much so far? I thought you were supposed to save 10% as a rule of thumb, so I figured it would come out higher since we're just starting.  It also doesn't take into account that when he retires in 5 years, he'll receive half of his base pay every month. Assuming he retires at his current rank, that will be $1765.20 per month. So I'm trying to figure that into how much we need to be saving.

personalfinance,$123k Student Loans &amp; IBR - Am I Missing Something??,"I have about $123k in 2 federal student loans: 
$32,834 Direct Sub Consolidation
$90,847 Direct Unsub Consolidation

Obviously I joined 9 separate fed loans into 2 consolidated fed loans. Using IBR repayment method at &lt;$24,000/yr taxable income, I owe $0/month for the next 144 months (12 years). 

Assuming I make every minimum payment on time for the next 12 years, any remaining balance is forgiven. So if I stay at this income bracket, I'll pay $0 on my $123k loan and all the rest will be forgiven. 

Am I missing something? Or is this the gold mine of student loan repayment?! It seems too good to be true, but the folks with fed loan assure me this is the case. Am I missing any variables? Obviously if I earn more each year, my payments go up. I am married, filing separately which, according to the fed loan calculator, puts my payment possibilities as such:

$35k income = ~$144/month
$40k income = ~$205/month
$45k income = ~$268/month
$50k income = ~$330/month
$60k income = ~$455/month
At this rate, if have to earn $92k/year for my minimum payments to be so high that I'd pay off the entire loan! In all honesty, I'll likely be at the $35k-$40k range for the next 12 years, meaning I'll make minimum payments ONLY and pay off my loans after 12 years, having spent only about $21k-$30k. 

If this is all correct, then I understand I will get taxed on the forgiven amount. If, 12 years from now, they forgive $102k (the highest-likely amount to be forgiven), what will that interest be? Or how can I find out?

And most importantly, is this a good decision?! It seems like it, but am I missing something?

Thanks PF!!",finance,1401147699
personalfinance,So I feel like I'm kind of effed for a while,"Sorry for the long post, guys. If I had made a similar post to PF when I first started reading the sub a while back, I may have been able to stop digging sooner. Needing some insight.

I'm kinda screwed for the next few years as I dig myself out of a hole. Definitely not as bad off as some people, but I've set myself back a bit and need some insight as to how to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.

So here's the deal. My income is 40k gross. I went through a rough stretch of alcoholism and drug use and just generally not giving a fuck where I ran up about $12,000 in credit card and personal loan debt. This was after busting my ass and paying $15,000 in student loan debt over the course of 3 years and wiping that out completely. The 12k is now consolidated into a single loan with a 17.99% APR. The loan terms are 4 years, which breaks out to about $350/month.

I also was stupid through all this and bought a car I really couldn't afford --- basically it's $275 per month. I still owe $10k on this car and it's only worth 6k, so getting rid of it is really not an option at this point. The car is a higher end used model that's costly to maintain and fix (and it's getting up there in mileage to the point where this model has some major replacements that have to be made), so it may be worth looking at a trade-in on a modest vehicle if I know that service isn't an issue for a while.

I owe about $2000 to the IRS for back taxes that I negotiated to $200 a month until I get my next tax return.

Monthly Income/Expenses break out like this:

Income: $2520 (after taxes - includes freelance stuff)
Rent: $550
Utilities: $100
Taxes: $200
Car: $275
Loan: $350
Insurance: $80
Cell: $100
Gas: $130

I guess my question after giving a general financial picture is figuring out how I need to approach this loan and tax situation, in addition to the car situation and where I could cut my other expenses. Should I just focus whatever extra I can muster to making a principal only payment on the loan every month, or should I try and get these taxes out of the way? Should I think about trading the car in, if for no other reason than I'm already upside down on it and that gap isn't going to close especially with the increasing repair and maintenance costs (we're talking possible $500+ at a time)?

Maybe I'm overreacting, as I realize that many people have far more obligations and have far less than $700+ in disposable income each month. But it's kind of depressing me that I don't have a lot of room for saving and am overextended to the point where I don't think I could get a loan for a house if I wanted to. What would you focus on to expedite this process? My head's in a good place now, I've been sober for a year and have acknowledged this wreckage and I plan on this being the last time I have to figure this stuff out. Obvious throwaway. Direction is really what I need.",finance,1401147742
personalfinance,"I'm getting married soon, and we have no idea how to combine our finances, largely because they don't exist. Any tips?","So, we're two Canadians who have a problem. How do we manage home finances? 

Her financial case is rather simple. She finished a degree, did a relevant internship, and will be back in Canada a month before the wedding to look for a job. She has zero income and zero assets, but also zero debt! I'd say zero is a nice place to be after a degree. She has a B.A. International Development, which [according to Payscale.com](http://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Degree=Bachelor_of_Arts_(BA\)%2c_International_Development_Studies/Salary) has an average yearly salary of $33971 - $47500. So, I think it's reasonable to expect her to have a $30000 salary after two months of job hunting.

My case is a bit trickier, and I constantly have problems with how to manage acceptable expense level. I'm still a student, finished a bachelor degree but now pursuing a professional degree, about to finish my second year of four. I have a $250000 line of credit floating at prime interest rate (3% at the moment). I do not have a requirement to paying off anything but interest on this line of credit for another 8 years or so. On this account, I have withdrawn $85000. In addition, I have a combination national/provincial student loan which does not accumulate interest until I graduate (2016). The amount owed on that is now ~$45000, and by finishing will owe ~$90000. Upon graduation I plan to shift all student loan debt into the line of credit, since the repayment options have inferior interest rates.

So my current total debt is ~$130000 with at least another ~$45000 guaranteed. 

After 2016 my salary will begin at ~$50000, increasing over five/six years to a maximum of ~$70000. At that point, I feel my debt burden of an expected $200000 will be manageable. EDIT: Field is medicine, salary after that 6 years is expected to be &gt;$200000 pretax. That is why I am not concerned with what happens at that point and why the massive debt burden for now is worth it for a passion as well as financially manageable in the long run. I am more concerned with the next decade until that point. It does not seem reasonable to me to indiscriminately accumulate more debt for the next decade and apply for further credit.

Enough info, on to my questions.

- For the next two years, we'll have to manage costs on one income. How should we combine expenses? I should undoubtedly take a portion of the expense, but how much? How did you combine expenses in your own relationships?

- To what extent do I have a responsibility to minimize debt for our mutual finances when it is already so daunting? Perhaps this one is unanswerable.

- How do couples successfully manage basic household financial decisions? (looking for examples, I hope we know basic communication by now as a starting point)

- Do you have any tips for newly combined finances in general?

- Is the maintenance of my debt as an isolated entity which she does not have to be involved in a reasonable path forward?

- Are there specific tax breaks or other financial laws we should know about? I've heard she can write off some of my tuition.",finance,1401148825

personalfinance,Car Options Giving Me a Headache,"So I'm trying to decide what to do about a car that I need to buy to commute to a new job.. here are some details:

I recently graduated college and started a job that is a 90 minute commute both ways about 3 weeks ago. This job is paying me a gross salary of 63000 a year.

I graduated college with 8000 dollars in student loan debt at 3.65% and my only other debt is 450 dollars on a credit card at a ridiculous interest rate that I'll pay off as soon as I get my first paycheck (paid every 4 weeks).

My wife and I only have about 2400 a month in expenses.

So for graduation, my parent's have offered to either put $2k down on a used car or trade in an old car of theirs towards a new car (if they have a $5k for any trade in deal or something). 

So my thought is that I want to buy a safe, reliable car that's fairly new with low mileage and good gas mileage. Basically my plan is to run it into the ground over the next 8 - 10 years all the while saving money for my next car so I can pay cash for it.

I'm interested in paying $14k for a 2014 kia forte (after $5k for any trade in). To me, this seems like a better deal than buying a 6-10 year old car with 60k-100k miles for $8k-$12k even though it's a little more than I want to pay.

I'm wondering if there's a right answer to this question? I feel like $14k for a new car is too good of a deal to pass up since it is only a few thousand more than I want to pay.

I guess I'm just looking for advice and perspective and making sure I haven't overlooked any details.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and help me out.",finance,1401154261

I know most of the general advice for paying back loans (minimum and then highest interest first, etc) but I'm mainly wondering about is the various repayment plans. I dont think the PLUS loans qualify for any plans, regardless of my mothers income, but I know some of mine do qualify for ones such as the ICR or IBR repayment plans. One in particular says Ill only pay an estimated $3k over the principal of the loans after all payments. The thing is, most of these repayment plans are over a set amount of months. If I pay off early, does that reduce the effectiveness of the plan? Or are there better ways to pay these off? Due to living situations and the salary I'll have, I'll likely only have $300 - $600 left over each month. Thanks in advance, and sorry about the text wall.",finance,1401155989

On Wednesday, the entire Táchira burned in protests against the national government .

Katheriin ( well , with two ""i"") called at 9 and 30 am and told him that a motor had come to tell them that the business had to close . Take advantage to go to San Cristobal to make market. ""In Rubio gets nowhere . You see. That embarrassed , "" I said . Yamilet , another daughter , was left to the care of children. ""We agreed to meet at the pharmacy. There was a peaceful protest.

At midnight the mayor and several councilors Rubio came to see the status of detainees. Previously, they took care of desesposarlas effective , remove the bandage , you clean strokes , comb . Students dressed them in any handmade flannel . A councilor , when he saw the condition of the mother and the daughter , did not hesitate to tell a sergeant : ""I change by these two women."" I completely ignored . At two in the morning came the CICPC . Gloria gave him to sign a statement acknowledging that it had complied with all their rights. She was angry , he said he would not sign because it was false. Too fake . By the way, had already told Yamilet at a time who was able to see it , a guard was mounted on facebook a picture of him , blindfolded , surrounded by petrol bombs , mortars , cloves and vinegar bottles .

22 were arrested , two teachers , a photographer , students, people who were not complaining and with a disabled leg full of buckshot. Then mounted in a convoy. The had bowed . Gloria was mounted had a foot on the head : "" Here is this fucking bitch "" they said. They removed the carrying 2,600 Bs to market. They were taken to the command of San Antonio del Táchira.

Finally, thanks to the close defense advocates Venezuelan Penal Forum , managed to get out. They have a precautionary measure. Mother and daughter are due every 24th of each month in the prosecution of San Antonio.

Gloria , though is therefore irreducible . ""I wanted to sue because I violated my rights."" Account 's daughter , terrified and begging him, ""Mom, we are humble , we are poor , who will listen to us ? "" . The judge gave a higher argument: if it demanded everything would be worse.

I wonder if it seems more appropriate to use a pseudonym for this story. "" I do not care to read my name. I do not want this to happen to any other Venezuelan "" . I stay silent. ""Sure,"" just answer .

He speaks of the aftermath . Bruises, internal injuries , swelling of the cervical , shoulder dislocation . And sleep , that he did not know to where. Still retains some purple in the face. Then I drop a phrase that sums up the violence : ""I was a liver .... My face was a monster.""

"" Are you afraid ? "" You ask . I confess who fears that one of the submissions leave detention. "" Would not you prefer to keep quiet ? "" Insist. "" All this has to be known ,"" he explains . I wrote down his name a second time, Gloria Tobon .

"" I studied up to high school seniors . I have worked as a pastry chef , maintenance, things like that. Now I'm a persecuted policy, what would I think? "" .

Mom won't be able to help me financially, so I'm basically on my own.

Looking to make the most of a bi-weekly paycheck and expand on it.,"This may sound trivial but bear with me, it will be a long-ish read. I know next to nothing about investing, banking, or credit. All of that is gonna have to be spoon fed to me. I like to think my spending habits fit my budget but I don't have much to begin with. I'm not a huge spender but I do know my means.

A little about me: I'm 22 years old and dependent on my uncle whom I live with. I have a job that barely breaks $13k as a yearly salary. I just got an Associates degree which I'm looking to utilize in the near future as something that could land me a higher paying job. I do plan on advancing my education, however.

Here's the bad part: I literally don't have a plan for the future, near or far. I have no credit, no concrete ideas for any sort of investing, nothing. But I do enjoy a challenge.

For now all I have to work with is $1000-$1200 a month which doesn't include my share of rent, car insurance, gym membership, gas expenses, food, phone bill, and preventative maintenance for the car I have now. After all of that is factored in, I would be left with about $200 left over per month. I would love to work with it and turn that into a solid foundation for building wealth but I have no clue where to begin.

I was kind of pissed but 1.9 is still really good.

But, looking at my statement it looks like I am paying around $38 a month in interest. Is this right? I played with some numbers in the calculator above and saw that paying ~$38 a month in interest, which actually means my APR is 4%... so in 1 year, I will pay $456 in interest, almost half of the total interest amount quoted above

Quote:
""The Wisconsin Idea is the political policy developed in the American state of Wisconsin that fosters public universities' contributions to the state: ""to the government in the forms of serving in office, offering advice about public policy, providing information and exercising technical skill, and to the citizens in the forms of doing research directed at solving problems that are important to the state and conducting outreach activities.""[1] A second facet of the philosophy is the effort ""to ensure well-constructed legislation aimed at benefiting the greatest number of people.""[2] During the Progressive Era, proponents of the Wisconsin Idea saw the state as ""the laboratory for democracy"", resulting in legislation that served as a model for other states and the federal government.[2]

The Wisconsin Idea is a philosophy embraced by the University of Wisconsin System, which holds that research conducted at the University of Wisconsin System should be applied to solve problems and improve health, quality of life, the environment and agriculture for all citizens of the state. This Progressive-era policy applied the expertise of the state's university to social legislation that benefited all the state's citizens; it led to classic programs such as regulation of utilities, workers' compensation, tax reform, and university extension services; sometimes expressed in the maxim that ""the boundaries of the university are the boundaries of the state.""

I have about 10 or 11K in debt that is currently in collections. (I don't live in the US so the awesome 7 year rule you guys have there regarding collections doesn't apply to me.) It is several small debts and two larger debts, owed to various companies or collectors. These are debts I incurred when 20, jobless, and being in total denial about my bad financial situation. I have finally gotten a job after four years unemployment - with a good income. I am considering taking a loan (12 K) to pay off all the debts that I currently have in order to -

a) Get the collectors off my back

b) Try to fix my credit (in Sweden you have something called ""payment marks"" on your credit history that will go away three years to the day after you make payments on delinquent bills or debts)

c) Have one monthly payment to one place instead of making 18 payments to several different places and trying to keep track of all the numbers

I can pay roughly 800 or 1000 a month and have this 12 K loan paid off within a year (give or take a month or two). So long as I don't pay this loan late it won't be a problem - and I plan on making automated payments each month so it is pulled automatically from my bank account so no risk of forgetting about it.

The interest on a loan like that is somewhere between 5 - 7%. I don't have any confirmed numbers and am supposed to talk to them on the phone today to get a more solid number on what the interest rate will be.

 * I live in the Netherlands. The house market is still scraping the bottom. Maybe it is the lowest point but not sure. It seems the houses are still overpriced - the total drop is somewhere like 20-30% at this moment. My house is about 25% below the price I bought it and I cannot sell it without losing a lot.
 * I have one house with 2 partial mortgages: No1. I am paying the principal and the interest; No2. - I pay only the interest - after 27 years I will have to repay the principle in full (or take another mortgage or whatever). The total house value is split about 60%-40% between the mortgages (No2 - the interest only - is 40%).
 * My monthly payments are about 600 for the 1st mortgage and 200 for the second (interest only).
 * The effective interest rate for me now is 1.4% for both mortgages. (It is 2.7% but there is tax break of about 50% on the interest only). It is floating (that's why it is also so low) and fixed month by month.
 * My family can repay about 50% of the mortgage if we put everything in it
 * The savings bring practically 0% interest in the bank. We thought hat by repaying some of the mortgage, we will free up monthly income.
 * In few years we might need to move to a bigger house or even leave the country. Bu this is very remote.

What should we do? Which mortgage should we repay first, if any? Another concern is - if the Eu crashes and the politicians decide to fix it all with high inflation, then my debt will be of much less value. Same with the savings, but they are less in absolute value.",finance,1401178213
investing,Investing from the UK - practical tips on how to beat the 'spread'/'commission'/'entry/exit fee',"Hi all,

Seems like US investors have nice access to TD discounts and offers. I've just myself opened a TD account in the UK and used it to purchase about $1,000 worth of ETFs and was amazed to find that I was not charged a fee! Which is nice.

However, the ETFs I can purchase at no cost are only UK based. US ETFs charge a truckload, so getting in on Vanguard U.S. ETFs (not to be confused with Vanguard U.K. ETFs that track U.S. markets) is costly.

I'm concerned about my long exposure to the gilt (5+ years) and equally, want to back U.S. companies. My estimation is that the U.K. housing market will flat-line and the government will overreact by trying to raise interest rates while also pushing inflationary policies to try and bring alignment back.

With this in mind... as mentioned... I am considering investing in U.S. ETFs/MFs and EU shares. Any suggestions on a good broker or means for doing this with low entry/exit fees?",finance,1401181372

personalfinance,Question about helping girlfriend pay off student loans,"Hey everyone, thanks for any advice or information you can provide. I don't have a ton of knowledge about some of this and it has been difficult trying to sort through it on my own.

My girlfriend and I have been together for close to 5 years; although we are not engaged yet we will be soon (assuming she doesn't turn me down haha), but complicating the situation are our student loans. I graduated a few years ago and have managed to get my loans down to a reasonable amount of ~14k. That's made up of several small loans that have interest rates from 4-6%.

My girlfriend however is in a much tighter spot and is looking at ~91k, with some of the loans making up that total having 10-11% interest. The smart thing to do here would be to pay off those first, but up until now I have just focused on my own and haven't been helping her. We have been together for awhile at this point but haven't really combined our lives financially, and I think both of us have been putting off talking about it or assessing the situation.

We had a long talk the other night and came to the conclusion that we are both in it for the long haul and need to work together. My question comes about the best way to make this happen. As mentioned we are not engaged right now, but I would like to start paying off her loans next month. Is that a wise thing to do if we aren't married, or should we get married first? My guess is that if I pay money down on her loans, I can't claim that on taxes at the end of the year, is that right? I guess I'm just not sure what the smartest play is here, getting married first and then paying her loans, or paying her loans and waiting to get married. Complicating this issue is the fact that she would like to have a wedding costing several thousand dollars which I don't think we can afford right now, meaning if we should get married first it may result in her sacrificing some things. Just trying to find the best solution.

The good news is that we both have decent jobs so I think if we committed ourselves to paying htis down we could be in a much better spot in a few years (I make $46k/year and she makes $37k/year). Again thanks for any advice.",finance,1401199589
personalfinance,Trying to figure out if I need to make any changes to how I'm allocating my money to maximize Personal Net Worth and reduce debt.,"The Facts:

- Age 30, married, one child on the way.
- Combined incomes: $160,000/y plus yearly bonuses for wife
- Retirement Accounts: $93,000 in stocks, $23,000 in Roth IRAs, $45,000 in combined 401(k)'s, plus a employer-only funded pension for wife (didn't know pensions still existed, particularly in the private sector. Let alone employer only funded ones)
- Savings - $18,000 (but plan on using $2500 of that for opening college account once the little one arrives)
- House: $280,000 left on mortgage at 3.5%, approx. $120,000 equity
- 2 cars, worth about $7,000 combined
- Checking can fluctuate from $500-$5000, depending on when we get paid, when mortgage is paid, etc.  But never really gets above $5000.

Debts

- $90,000 in total student loans, with interest rates ranging from 3-6%
- $280,000 mortgage, paying $2150/m (this includes taxes/insurance, plus $100/m extra toward principal, on pace to pay mortgage off 3 years early if we keep it up)
- ~ $100/m in car insurance for both cars (actually not sure on this, we pay one lump sum for the year on both cars)
- Credit card: we put as much of our expenses on the credit card as possible, to earn the rewards points. This includes utility bills as long as the utility doesn't tack on a service charge. If that's the case, it's automatic withdrawal from checking.  We religiously pay them off each month, and never carry a balance.
- We each contribute the maximum that our respective employers will match to 401(k)s, and put $1000/m into a regular old savings account that earns a little bit of interest (better than nothing, i guess)

My questions/concerns/issues I'm wondering about:

- My car is 11 years old and has 123k miles on it, that combined with a new baby, we will be needing a new vehicle soon that we are really hoping to pay cash for to avoid a car payment (it's nice not having a car payment) will probably purchase next year.
- Kids.  We will be having more than 1, hopefully, and as I understand it, kids are expensive. Whats the best way to save? (college, and dealing with overall increased expenses with extra humans to support)
- Are we contributing the right amounts to the right accounts to pay off our debts the fastest while also increasing net worth/building up accounts to be able to pay for kids' college?
- Am I missing something? I feel like we are doing pretty good with everything, and the paying of debt and increasing retirement/savings is split pretty evenly.  

Right after we got married in 2012, we sold off $30k in stocks to pay off an 8% student loan, and lucked out to the point that between dividends and the stock market doing so well last year, the stock account earned it all back. I feel like that's generally not a good idea, but we just couldn't stomach 8% on $30,000. We definitely got lucky with that one.

personalfinance,Comparing 5 year cost: current BMW vs lightly used hybrid,"Can I get PFs opinion on the long-term costs of selling my current car vs keeping it?

Current car: 2008 BMW 328xi, 86,000 miles. No warranty. Has had regular maintenance. In great shape right now, but BMWs have a deserved reputation for being maintenance heavy, and expensive when they need it. In addition, the gas mileage is terrible, and it requires premium gas (19.8 MPG according to onboard computer.)

I owe $8,000 on my auto loan at 5% (not great.) The monthly payment is $267 but I've been paying $500 per month since I can and to reduce the loan amount. The value of the car is $13,500 to KBB, so I would hope to get $12,000 out of it if I sold it right now to a dealer.

Desired car can be found [here](http://www.lafontainevolkswagen.com/VehicleDetails/certified-2013-Volkswagen-Jetta_Sedan-SE-Dearborn-MI/2244218713). I really liked the VW hybrid, and moving to a hybrid removes the ""emotional loss"" of losing the BMW's performance-- it's hard to compare the two.

I drive about 18,000 miles per year. [This](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/savemoney.shtml) calculator tells me the savings over 5 years would be $10,375. Insurance costs would be nearly the same. 

The x-factor for me is maintenance. The VW comes with 2 year/24,000 mile warranty, and has 79,000 fewer miles than my BMW. 

So here is the comparison:

**BMW**

* Cost: $8,000

* Fuel over 5 years: $17,955

* Interest: ~$400 (based on what I'm paying monthly now.)


**VW**

* Cost: $18,000 (22k - 4k trade-in from the BMW)

* Fuel over 5 years: $7,580

* Interest: ~$1,000 (considering the 3% interest rate I was quoted. If the dealer can do better then less here.)


This leaves me at a 5 year cost of $26,355 for the BMW and $26,580 for the VW. I'm just having a hard time putting a valuation on having a car with 79,000 fewer miles and a 2 year warranty. Thoughts? Is there anything I'm missing here?

Note: I'm looking to downsize my lifestyle here as I'll be driving a lot more starting next year (part time MBA program at night.) I have a 6 month emergency fund, contribute to retirement accounts, etc. Please don't tell me to buy a 14 year old Honda Accord.",finance,1401205034
personalfinance,Bond investing: Is a bear still out there? (Vanguard Q&amp;A transcript),"/r/personalfinance gets into debates about the merits of investing in bonds (or not investing in bonds) more often than we should.  [This](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/scott-bond-investing-052014) is a good article that offers some perspective on the recent ""bond bear market.""  Among the highlights:

&gt;The common definition of a bear market is a decline of 20% or more. If you use that standard, there has never been a bond market environment in any 12-month period of time that conforms to a loss of 20% or more... The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index declined by 2% last year.

&gt;More recently, we've seen returns that have actually been positive. Interest rates have fallen so far in the first 3½ months or so of 2014, and we've now realized a return of about 2.4%. So the cumulative entire period, including 2013 and the first few months of 2014, the bond market has provided, essentially, a flat return.

A 0% return on bonds while stocks have increased 30%+ is certainly unattractive, but that's classic recency bias.  Nobody was knocking on bonds in 2008-2009, if only because they were disparaging over the -30%+ drops in the stock portion of their portfolios.

&gt;The key point I think we're trying to make is that trying to time changes in interest rates or any other economic indicator is incredibly difficult.

People have been forecasting a catastrophic rise in interest rates since 2009.  Not surprisingly, one criticism of bond funds often cited by the market timers is ""bonds are a terrible investment right now - interest rates are going to rise!""  In response:

&gt;... When interest rates are rising, it means that bond prices are falling. And typically, unless you're earning a lot of income in your portfolio, that's going to generate losses in the short term for bond investors. But the silver lining to rising interest rates is that if you're continuing to make new purchases of bonds, in either a portfolio of bonds or a bond mutual fund, you're going to realize higher levels of income going forward, and prospectively you could earn higher levels of returns going forward as well. So rising interest rates for the long-term investor is likely going to create a portfolio with more income and higher prospective returns.

Clearly anyone depending on their bond portfolio for income should be somewhat worried about rising interest rates, but for a long-term investor you can buy bond fund shares at a discount when interest rates rise and likely come out ahead.

I thought the best piece of advice is one that I paraphrase in various forms time and time again here:

&gt;But we believe very strongly that there remains a strategic reason to invest in bonds. And the reason you do that is to help balance your portfolio, keep it more diversified, and help insulate you from equity market risk, which, in our minds, is the true source of volatility in your portfolio.

Lastly, if anyone needs a visual reminder of ""Why bonds?"", [here](http://imgur.com/zeWO4PI) is a convincing one.",finance,1401205784

Bitcoin,Avoid U.S. Taxes on Bitcoin. Give to Charity.,"With all the moaning and complaining about the impact of the recent IRS statement on the tax-ability of bitcoin, most have overlooked one good outcome of this clarification. One that hopefully will unleash even more philanthropy in our bitcoin community.

Under current IRS guidance, dispositions (sales and spendings) of bitcoin are a taxable event. Bitcoin is property and when it's sold or spent, an individual must calculate the gain or loss on that transaction and report it as a capital gain or loss on his/her Federal Income Tax filing.

Except for this: Bitcoin that has been held for more than a year and gone up in value can be donated to a recognized charity without having to report any taxable gain to the IRS; what's more, one can take a deduction for its full market value at the time of donation. Donations of appreciated bitcoin held a year or less are still deductible, but their gains in value must also be recognized (and taxed). 

This often overlooked fact turns a significant negative into a strong positive. Don't sell or spend profitable long-term holdings of bitcoin. Inasmuch as you can, donate them to charity and buy yourself a double tax break with your generosity.

There is a long section on Contributions of Property found here: http://www.irs.gov/publications/p526/ar02.html#en_US_2013_publink1000229703

Here you'll find more specific information in the sections Giving Property That Has Increased in Value -- Ordinary Income Property &amp; Capital Gain Property:
http://www.irs.gov/publications/p526/ar02.html#en_US_2013_publink1000229755

The IRS Guidance Summary is here: http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Virtual-Currency-Guidance

**Example**: Let's say in 2014 you have taxable income of $100k and thus you were in a 25% marginal tax bracket; and you itemize deductions on Schedule A. You have $3000 worth bitcoin (present value) to sell/spend or donate; for those coins, you paid $1000 more than a year before.

If you sell or spend those bitcoin, you will pay $300-560 in Federal taxes ($2000 gain X 15-28%), depending on what tax rate is applied. And you might also pay state income taxes; at say 5%, that's another $100.

If you donate the $3000 worth of bitcoin to a charity, you pay no Federal or state tax, and you pick up a tax benefit of $750 in the Sch A deduction of $3000; that is, $3000 X 25%.

I'm 21 years old, unemployed, seeking employment in graphic design. I graduated college a semester early (saved money, which was nice). I've earned some small scholarships during this time, but mostly I got some federal loans and private loans. The grace period on my loans ends soon and I'm terrified of what might happen if I don't land a job soon. My parents will try to help me out, but we're basically the working poor, so it'll be a struggle. I used to have a savings account when I was like 16, but money has always been tight and so I pulled all my money out of savings so all my stuff could be accessed through a checking account and debit card. I know I should probably have a savings and checking, but my current bank is weird. They told me I had to have like a minimum of $400 in my savings at like all times or else I would get charged a fee. I'm hoping to leave them very soon for a better bank. So anyway I have around $700 to my name, from what I have earned through student employment part-time jobs, birthday money, money I got for dog-sitting once, etc. That's all that's in my bank account, from over the years. I live with my parents. I just recently got my first car (gifted to me from my grandpa who doesn't need it anymore; so yay that is was ""free"" minus the DMV fees and 4 new tires my family had to put on). I've never had a credit card before; my boyfriend says I should get one and start to build credit. I have no idea where to even begin with that, or if I *have* to just yet. Would it help? I don't want to abuse it. I applied to Discover once, but was denied. Not having a savings account was one reason, but the denial letter listed some other reasons too (that I can't remember at this moment; nothing horrendous though). Also, since I am pursing graphic design, people have suggested I do some freelance work or start my own Etsy shop to sell my illustrations. My college was pretty shitty and didn't teach me about the inner workings of that at all. So while money on the side would be nice, I don't think I can get into that just yet. Getting a business license to sell stuff online would be down the line, etc.

I think what I need to know is: where do I even begin on getting my shit together? Should I get a credit card? If so, how do I determine the best one for me? How do I build credit? Since I don't have a job yet, what should I do about my loans? I think only my federal ones can be deferred. But should I do that? Ugh, I get anxiety about math too and all the loan jargon. My throat tightens and I just wanna cry, but that won't solve anything.

Obviously, I can repay more aggressively than $345/m.

I have been told by, well, older people that this isn't a loan I should be aggressively repaying because of its low interest and that its interest can be claimed as a tax deductible. Instead, they suggest putting it in my RRSPs which I guess have some other tax benefit. They also suggest buying a house to build equity but that's a whole other can of worms.

The Sob Story (aka, the part you can skip): I quit my job 2 years ago to do some freelance software development. I bit off more than I could chew and racked up a bunch of CC debt while working for clients. Problem is, I didn’t complete my jobs on time, and projects took longer than I estimated. Also, I was lazy and depressed. Yes, my bad, I get it. I’ve still got some clients, so I have a small income per month. Now I’m looking to get a job and/or find new clients but haven’t found one yet. Sob Story Over.

Current (Experian) credit score is 700 +/- 5. My CC debt is just under $11,500 with about 99% utilization and average APR of ~20%. Yikes, I know. I also have a car payment of about 200, insurance 130, phone 30, friend loan 100, no rent/internet from having an awesome friend. My current income is about $1k/month but I can’t necessarily count on it forever. (yes, that’s post tax)

Right now, I’m losing about $150 per month on interest from the CCs with my minimum payments cresting $250. With my very modest current income, you can see why I’m really trying to reduce the interest if not the monthly payment. I typically need to use my CCs to feed my car and/or myself, losing any progress to paying it off and reducing those interest charges.

So, my bank has a personal credit line that I could apply for, but I wouldn’t know the limit without actually applying.

When it comes to 0% intro interest cards, I don’t think I’d qualify for any that I’ve seen. Really what I want is something to reduce the interest losses per month and nuke a particularly troublesome 23%, $5k card from orbit.

So… options.
1 – Try for the credit line.
2 – Stay the course; revisit once cash flow/employment status changes.
3 – Something else I haven’t considered. Possibly look at the credit union that financed my vehicle.

I appreciate any advice.",finance,1401255489

gaming,Can we stop the hype? Please?,"Watch_Dogs has just come out, and while it's a pretty good game on it's own merits, it's abundantly clear that what was promised when the game was first revealed was, at best, an unrealistic and scripted representation of what the game might look like, and, at worst, an outright fabrication. And yet, it's one of the most pre-ordered games in recent memory and has, in general, done very, very well for itself. It's also surrounded by an atmosphere of critical hostility, with both proponents and opponents of the game being hostile to both sides of the debate. I've been deliberately avoiding the conversation this time because it's proven to be detrimental to my mental health to engage in such discussion, but it is there. 

The bloated expectations, ludicrous pre-order rates etc all come down to one thing. Hype. Hype is a terrible thing that has been the No.1 worst thing that has happened to the games industry in the last generation. Hype is an extremely insidious thing that drowns out legitimate criticism of titles, creates bloated expectations, and drives the toxic pre-order culture. It allows companies to dupe gullible consumers into doing their marketing for them, and is just generally awful. 

It needs to stop. 

We, as gamers, need to learn to be a bit more discerning and critical when it comes to unreleased games. We need to learn to not just buy into the hype, bur to stop saying ""shut up and take my money"", and to start questioning the realism of each piece of content that we see. Especially at E3, we need to stop just lapping up every bet of content we're fed. We also need to be open to critical perspectives for the games we are excited for pre-release. And it's not just with Watch_Dogs. We all remember the Killzone 2 ""gameplay"" trailer. Colonial Marines was a game made of 100% bullshot. The Last of Us also suffered from either downgraded AI or outright lied about it's AI pre-release, as can be seen in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF0EaH73ee4) video. Whether these games were never of that quality or were for some reason downgraded pre-release, it's clear that the hype for these games negatively impacted the reception of the final product and, inentionally or not, deceived consumers.

And, really, why get hyped? To set yourself up for disappointment? It's not going to add anything to your gaming experience when the game finally comes out. When you get hyped, only three things can happen:

1) Disappointment
2) Expectations are met
3) Despite that your expectations have not been met, you convince yourself that they were to avoid disappointment, and become hostile to any alternative opinion about the title that may break the illusion you have constructed. 

I've been there all three times. I was a mook who pre-ordered Aliens: Colonial Marines. I know first hand how damaging hype can be to a game. There's no point in getting hyped. 

This a bit rambly and stream-of-consciousness, but it's something that's been on my mind for a while, and I'm hoping that in the environment of Watch_Dogs I won't be demeaned and insulted for expressing an opinion in this sub like I usually do. Really, I want you to take this away from my post:

Don't get hyped. Get excited, by all means, but remain cautiously optimistic. Hype is fundamentally bad for the consumer and has led to the toxic pre-order culture, Day 1 DLC, and all kinds of other shady bullcrap by the AAA games industry because it knows it can get away with it if the game it is attached to is sufficiently hyped. Be a discerning consumer, not a sheep. 

Thanks for reading and not blindly downvoting. 

BTW: Don't give me any ""b-but the game is still good"" stuff in regards to a released game, or that ""the pre-release stuff might have been running on a high end pc"". The point is that the game we were advertised is not the ones we received. 

We are not here to defend companies. We are consumers. They are here to impress us, to justify themselves to us. We are not their marketing, and we should not be their ""fans"". We are critics, each and every one of us, and unless we want to see more of this nonsense, we should start acting like it.",technology,1401275731

Basically, I owe a shit ton of student loans (law school) and I work in the public sector (yay possible forgiveness) but I make shit money. Hubby owes a fair amount in student loans (has his masters) that just got out of deferment. 

My IBR amount was calculated at the beginning of this year, when hubs loans were in deferment. They used our combined salary to determine the amount. Now hubs loans are out of deferment and they are using our combined salary to determine *his* amount... So our loan payments are almost the same, but when added together it's pretty steep. Logically I feel like if they are going to use our combined income our loans should be considered together... Or they should be assessed on our separate incomes.

personalfinance,Underemployed in a bit of a pickle,"Poor planning combined with bad timing have left me in a tight spot. I finished my master’s in a somewhat specialized field in december. I’ve been job hunting ever since then with minimal luck. I’ve been living with my parents for several years rent-free, but they are trying to sell their house and then moving in with my ailing grandmother. The plan is to move in with my SO of 4 years once they sell the house. Luckily we’re in a very affordable mid-sized city. I’m confident we can find a suitable place in a decent neighborhood for $700-$800/month all told.  

 My current job pays $12.60 an hour and is full time with benefits and a 401k. It’s a small company that isn’t doing so well right now and my boss mentioned last week that he may need to cut me back to half time in the coming weeks or months. I do have a second round interview in a few weeks for a job that is not in my field but could be a decent stepping stone to bigger and better things. It would pay somewhere in the low 40s with great benefits but wouldn’t start until October. Obviously I haven’t stopped job hunting; this is just my best prospect at the moment.  

I own a 12 year old Pontiac with over 200k miles so who knows how much longer that is going to last me. I just had to replace brake shoes and 2 rotors at about $300 and am getting to the place where I’m concerned about sinking too much more into this car.  

I have about $24k in student loans (almost all Stafford) with interest rates ranging from 1.5% to 6.7%.  

I have about $10k in credit card debt at about 12% interest because I’m an idiot. This is split between 2 cards which I have taken out of my wallet.  

My savings account has about $8k in it right now.  

I have about $3k in a mutual fund with USAA and am contributing 6% of my paycheck to my company’s 401k which they have matched.  

As far as fixed expenses go, I pay about $160/month for car insurance and my cell phone (currently shopping around car insurance policies…), roughly $100 for gas, $8 for Netflix, and probably $300 for groceries.  

I also had an unexpected surgery in February and have been paying off about 3K in medical bills since then. I have about $500 left on that.  

I guess my question is regarding that 8k in savings. I know I need to get rid of that credit card debt ASAP, but given the volatility of my job and housing situation right now, I’m just not sure how much of that savings I feel comfortable parting with.

personalfinance,How can we prepare to purchase a house after a bankruptcy?,"This October my husband will be discharged from his bankruptcy. We currently live in military housing and with recent changing to allowances we will be paying around $1600 (including all utilities) a month to continue to live on base. Two months ago we begun a strict budget to save $12000 in the next year in hopes we can purchase a house in the $120000 range. This house price is very common in our area. Unfortunately renting in this area is very expensive, most two bedroom apartments run $1000(before utilities) a month plus additional for our one small dog and most likely the cost of a storage unit, so moving before purchasing would not save us any more money. 

Here's some back story: My husband filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy two and a half years ago. We had spent close to a year struggling to pay off debts from his previous marriage before he decided to file. The debts that were discharged included credit cards, private student loans (because they aren't federal he was able to have them completely discharged), and a house with a second mortgage. The house being the number one reason he filed, as it was put on the market in 2007 and has sat empty since 2010 when he received military orders to move. No payments have been made since 2010 and the bank has yet to foreclose on the property. After speaking with his attorney, we were informed that the bank will keep the loan in his name until it is foreclosed on, whenever that is. 

I on the other hand have good credit and was not included in his bankruptcy. I monitor it often and my score is in the 730s. I assume that the only thing keeping that score there is my credit age(7 years) and I have a smaller number of accounts (12). BUT I'm a full time pharmacy student that receives a small military disability check and a monthly GI Bill stipend so I don't have the income to qualify for the loan by myself. I commute roughly 30 minutes to and from my university and max out my class schedule along with volunteer with the Red Cross so even a part time job is not really an option. I net(as none of it is taxable) $14000 a year and he grosses $63,000. And our car loan is in my name and my father-law's as we ran into the lack of my income issue previously. 

How difficult will it be for my husband and I to qualify for a mortgage in a year? Should we save more of a down payment and expect a much higher interest rate? Should I suspend school for a year to get a job to qualify for a loan and then return to school after we secure a home in my name only? I have roughly 4-5 years of school left as I plan on specializing in my career field(I will not have any major out of pocket costs because of my GI Bill and financial aid grants/scholarships). I have not purchased a house before and I qualify for a VA home loan. Any advice or help would be appreciated as no one has given us any straight answers or I'm asking the wrong people. 

Thank you!!

EDIT: I appreciate the responses, even if some of them were hard to swallow. It would make more sense for us to continue to save, pay off our car loan quickly and build my husband's credit until we finish school. I'm going to look into something that would be cheaper to rent until we are ready to make permanent roots.

gaming,Gaming gems with lasting first impressions,"Aside from the obvious mainstream titles, some games have left lasting impressions on me as a gamer, and are constantly on my mind as a result.

For example, the original Tron game, Tron 2.0 had one of the most memorable intro's with the depiction of traveling in a data stream and credits being placed on blocks as they pause. This gripped me. Having seen the movie, but knowing little about the game that would ensue, and just how awesome it would actually be, was one of the best, most lasing experiences as a gamer: [Tron 2.0 Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSleac8-ph8)

Another gem I knew nothing about, that impressed me, was Advent Rising. What really got me to pay the game serious attention was the first few minutes with the intro. Looking back at it, the intro, as intriguing as it was, is quite dwarfed by what would ensue, but I cannot present that without spoiling the plot: [Advent Rising Intro - not the best quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYzU8PDuBms)

Another title was Freelancer. Unlike the above its fairly well known, but I feel I can mention it now, since this type of game is mostly forgotten today. Yes there's Star Citezen, but its hardly the same thing since SC is shaping up to be more of a space flight simulator, than being a game driven by science fiction and story. In any case, the trailer I mention here is one that at least some players have never seen, being an extended trailer of sorts. Fact is, its another prime example of gripping the player during the first few moments. [Freelancer Long Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsWPFUzxgRU)

personalfinance,Taking out a loan on current house to purchase fixer-upper?,"I'll hopefully give as much info as needed here to properly paint the picture...

I'm currently in a situation where I rent out a portion of my house for monthly income that covers all expenses (mortgage, utilities, taxes, minor repairs) and nets a few hundred bucks a month.  The tenants are currently on month-to-month leases, have 0 intention of moving out, and would be willing to sign on for 6-12 month leases if I'd like that peace of mind if I follow through with this.

While I currently have limited liquidated money (&lt;$10k), I have a lot of equity in my current house.  I purchased the house in 2010 for $145k, currently have approx $130k left on the mortgage.  An appraisal a year ago to refinance my mortgage valued the house at $172k.  Since that appraisal, the market in my local area has improved and I have done some fairly expansive work on the house (redid a bathroom, new carpeting throughout, repainted, new landscaping) that pushes the house closer to $200k.

I have a general plan to leave my house and the landlord situation (house is not designed for a single person, I'm single and without kids, extremely tired of having roommates and desperately want to live alone) at the end of 2015.  Given my penchant for DIY work, income-generating situation of my current house, and desire to ""buy the worst home in a nice neighborhood and fix it up"", I'm looking to target buying a fixer-upper in not-move-in-condition for $120-150k in my optimal part of town, spending the next 18 months fixing it up exactly to my liking, then placing my current house on the market at the end of 2015 and moving into the new house upon its completion.

The problem with this plan is that I don't have the money available at the moment to put down a deposit for the new house.  I have enough disposable income coming in between my job and the current tenants to cover a 2nd mortgage/taxes/bare-minimum utilities/loan payments/renovation costs (assuming I do the vast majority myself) for the 18 month duration, but don't have it on-hand now.  I could take that extra disposable income and set it aside for a down payment, but by the time that reaches the $30k required for 20% down on a 150k house, it will be near the end of 2015, and I'd be moving into a house that will be pre-renovation and unlivable.  Pushing this whole timetable back a year or 2 is potentially an option, but then a. I will become increasingly unhappy in my current situation as landlord, which is a major problem for me b. the risk that a tenant will move out will increase, c. the risk of major emergency repairs being needed on my 105+ year old house that wipes out all savings will increase drastically.

What I'm considering doing is taking out a HELOC/2nd mortgage out against my current house (I have very good credit, so I should be able to find one for a reasonable interest rate from local banks/credit unions), using that money as the down payment for the 2nd house, straddle both houses for 18 months, then pay it off upon resale of my first house.  I may be able to find one to qualify me for a mortgage for less than 20% down (not even sure if this is legal and/or an option given my existing mortgage), but I'm assuming the PMI of such a mortgage would make it more expensive than the HELOC would be.  I haven't sought finite numbers from a bank/CU yet, so that may be incorrect.

Is this a viable (legal, feasible to qualify for, not credit/life-ruining) option?  Are there other options here that I'm overlooking and not considering?  I'm tempted to think that this scenario (buying a 2nd house before the first sells) is common enough that there has to be some feasible ways to make it work.  Thanks and any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Basically I couldn't afford my car loan so the bank and I settled on a lesser lump sum payoff amount. They were reluctant to give me anything in writing regarding the agreement and insisted I should take the settlement amount to a branch and just apply it towards the loan like I was making a payment with no paperwork or note on the receipt. I refused and eventually I got the settlement agreement and related paperwork, and sent a cashiers check with the memo ""Auto loan #xxxyyyzzz settlement in full"" to the collections department address specified, and confirmed that payment was received within their required time limit. Now it has been triple the length of time they stated it would take for me to get my lien release, they will not return my emails or phone calls, the employees at the branch have no knowledge of the situation, and checking my online access it shows that the settlement amount was applied to my loan and that I still owe the remaining balance, though the next payment due date has been pushed back to September for some reason.

Compliance joins the call, and I repeat most of the call, but it was clear this guy knew what bitcoin was. He asked me a lot or questions about Coinbase (my standard *exchange*) and he said a few times ""let me look that up"" and it could hear him typing.    
At the end he asked me to hold while he checked some ""guidelines"". 30 minutes later the 2nd lady I spoke to came back on the line (without compliance) and informed me that they would not authorize use of an account for this purpose and would not be making ACH transfers to Coinbase.    
She then said ""I'm sorry we won't be allowing you to open an account"".       
The account manager then apologized for any inconvenience and told me to have a nice day. 

So not only are they not embracing Bitcoin, mentioning it will prevent you from opening an account.

personalfinance,How to refinance high interest student loans?,"So coming from a middle class family the only way to pay for my education was through loans and the small amount of grants/scholarships I was given.

I have two sets of loans. One set in my name which are ""reasonable"" and lower interest rates.

And then another set (Parent plus loans I think they may only be in my parents name) which holds the highest balance and has an absurd rate of 7.9% that the government thought was fair at the time. I have a great paying engineering job now, and don't regret any of my steps along the way.

I also have a nice emergency fund from my previous internship. My high interest loans begin repayment in a month, and my job starts sooner than that. I have already budgeted to put a large portion of my income towards my loans while still putting money into a matching 401k, also thinking of starting a Roth IRA.

Anyway here is a breakdown of my loans with percentages. The low interest ones I think are okay for now, I will just pay the minimum until I pay off the high interest set. I've heard you may need to have made payments for a year or so before a bank or other lender is willing to refinance.

High interest loans, 7.9%  :(, I'm worried about (I'll just lump them all together since they are same rate and are unsubsidized):

Principal: $51575.00

Interest: $10,781.00 (I assume this will roll into the principal next month)

Total balance: $62,356

Currently thinking 4 to 4.5 years to pay this set off.

Lower interest set (already in repayment):

$10,505.00 at 3.15%
$5,321.00   at 4.25%

$6,618.00   at 6.55%  (this one is still high I think)


So how do I go about refinancing in the future or now if possible? Any other suggestions? I've heard people say it might be best to keep the government lender because you can defer loans and whatever in case anything happens. But my job is a long program and is pretty secure, but I know I should never say never. With a secure job I think I'd rather forego that and lower the interest rate.",finance,1401301231

Savings, Student Debt, &amp; Taxes","Ok, so I posted here a while back about my wedding and got some good feedback. Now that the deed is done and the situation has changed a bit, I'm back with a few more questions regarding the new student loans, taxes, and savings.
 

[Old Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1sdz4u/so_many_directions_what_to_do/)

**Quick Facts**

Monthly Income: $3750-$4250  

Savings: $7000  

Monthly Expenses: $3903  


**Updated Expenses**  

My Monthly Take Home Pay: $3750   

Her Monthly Take Home Pay: $250-500 

(she just moved in with me from MI to KY and picked up a part time at 10-20 hours week; she is still looking for another part-time gig short term to try towards 30+ hours a week, as well as looking for full-time related to her degree of mass comm.)


**Monthly Bills:**  
---- RENT: **$750** 

---- UTILITIES: **$150**(ranges from $75-150 depending on the season) 

---- INTERNET/TV: $55+115 = **$170**  (getting ATT bundle soon, will drop to $115 total)

---- CELL PHONES: $68+50 = **$118**  

---- CAR INSURANCE: **$280**  (two vehicles, should drop in August/Oct when we turn 25) 
  
---- NETFLIX: **$8**
  

**Monthly Budgeted Expenses:** 
   
---- GAS: **$350**  (70-mile commute for me, currently &lt;5mi for her)

---- FOOD: **$300** (includes food for pets)   

---- MISC: **$300**  (spending, entertainment, household items)

    

**My Debts (only in my name):**  

---- CAR LOAN 1: $11,300 @ 2.24% = **$328/mo**  

---- MY SALLIE MAE: $2800 @ 10.12% = **$72/mo**  

---- MY FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS: (4) totaling $7000 @ 3.4%-6.8% = **$80/mo**  

---- WEDDING LOAN: $5200 @ 6.24% = **$270/mo**
  


**Her Debts (only in her name):**  

---- CAR LOAN 2: $4,700 @ 5.5% = **$178/mo**    

---- CHASE STUDENT LOAN: $20,800 @ 8.25% = **$178/mo** 

---- DEPT OF EDUCATION LOANS (11 total serviced by SallieMae) totaling $32,200 @ 3.4%-6.8% = **$371/mo**  



**Other Notes**

-- I contribute 7% of salary to 401k to achieve a 5% match  

-- I contribute $200/mo to our HSA account (balance is $2k, plan to contribute $200/mo until deductible is met then cut back to maybe $50/mo) 
 


**Current Plan of Attack**

1. Build Savings until $10k (roughly 3 months if I lose my job)


2. Throw all extra money at the student loans, starting with highest interest



**Complication**  

Her parents pulled out another (currently) $70,000 @ 6.8% for her schooling in ParentPLUS loans. She did not know the extent of this until after we were married and I bugged her dad constantly until he gave me the actual info. When these loans were pulled, she had just agreed (verbally) to just pay $200/mo graduated to her parents to cover the loans. She had no idea it was so much. Her parents did not start paying until January and are on some tiered graduated plan where the current minimums due do not even cover the interest... i.e. the loan balance is INCREASING even when paying the $404/mo minimum payment. 

I calculated a payment of $573/mo over the remaining term (236 months) or so (minimum) to keep the balance going down. We are currently paying $241/mo to her parents for this as well. It's tempting to say fuckit because it is all in their name and they pulled the debt without telling her the total amounts, and any default would not affect us, but that would totally fuck up the otherwise good relationship with them.

**Questions**  

1. How fucked am I? I can answer this one: quite fucked.  I spent a lot of energy in school so I could be financially solvent early on after growing up poorly. But of course I fell in love with a girl with $50k in student loans to her name and another $70k her parents want help paying.


2. How do we file taxes to save the most money? Married joint? Married separate? She pays a sickening amount just in student loan interest every year and we have a huge income gap.


3. What should I do about the parent loans? Don't pay and piss them off? Morally she is somewhat responsible but its hard to shell out that money. We've currently contributed enough so our+her parents payment is the $573/mo keeping the balance from increasing, but it's a lot of extra a month to shoulder. 


**READ THIS** before posting the same retired bullshit pf comments

1.  Don't bitch about the wedding. It was done cheap, was awesome, and worth every penny. And it's done.

2. My car is somewhat upside down; value tanked 2 years after i bought it. It currently worth maybe $8k if I could sell it. if.

3. Her car is in better shape fiscally and is worth closer to $7-8k, however its nice not worrying about relibility issues so I'd rather not sell it only to pay off its loan and borrow another $2k to buy a $4-5k beater we will always be worrying about.


4. Yes she obviously fucked up hugely on the student loans. She doesnt math, no one taught her, and her parents are obviously pretty fucking dumb as well. They didnt even realize the balance would be going up for the first 10 years of the loan term until he sent me the info. She knew she was around $40k total but didnt know interest was accruing so its closer to $50k in her name. But she had no idea on her parent's situation.

5. She is looking for full-time work and multiple part time jobs to pick up the income level. She stresses about it enough and I can hardly ask her how its going because she gets so frustrated when she can't find work. Hopefully something changes for her soon.

dogecoin,"What's the opposite of FUD? CCC: Courage, Certainty, and Confidence?","Whatever it is, it is my mission to make sure all of my posts from now on to fall under that category! Starting with this one.

Part 1: So lately there were a lot of FUD posts in response to the ""price drop"", and I saw a lot of great responses to those here in the community. Let's keep up the good work and keep focusing on the positive! I want to point out that more than combatting FUD posts, we can keep our spirits high by actively posting CCC, every small victory counts! In my experience no matter what you may be engaging in it is better to focus on what you want to happen (keep a positive attitude) than what you don't want to happen (although it seems positive, this is actually a negative focus), because you tend to follow the direction of your focus. I'll use the metaphor of ultimate frisbee because it's something I enjoy and it seems fairly applicable to doges. If you're always focused on not dropping the disc, it will make you nervous and when it comes flying your way you'll panic and, more often than not, end up dropping the disc, but if you focus on catching the disc then you  will be properly focused and it is much more likely that you'll end up holding on to it! It's a subtle difference, but a very important one! So to start us off, I want to share some of my victories from the recent past!


Part 2: I have been evangelizing in the holy name of Doge on facebook in hopes to get a few converts and perhaps even a few adventurous local businesses to consider accepting doge for some of their services. I wasn't expecting much so I consider the few converts I made to be a great success! I got at least three friends to download wallets and started them off with their first 1k doge!

Even more exciting, one of my very best friends who recently started a ""beyond organic"" farm has agreed to sell some of his produce for doge! We will be well fed on the moon!

Hey Shibes,

I know the key to ensuring the longevity of our coin is to use it as a currency, not trade it as a commodity. I've been thinking of ways to help out the community and to also feed my entrepreneurial appetite.

Obviously I wanted to come up with something interesting enough for this community, but also something that hasn't been done before. My answer to this desire:

**[GiftShibe.com](http://www.giftshibe.com/)**

I wanted to create a website that was community based and design driven. My goal is to offer unique, handmade products that can be enjoyed by all ages. Above all else, I wanted to only except Dogecoin as a form of payment.

I'm in this for the long run, I want to continue to build this brand and the community around it. I'm not looking for a quick buck.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Here are some goals I have for this project:*

* Provide quality stuff people actually want to buy!
* Introduce new shibes to Dogecoin and reach other demographics
* Hold doge profits as long as possible and search for new ways to use them that help Dogecoin as a whole
* Donate a percentage of profits to a new charity each month. (Chosen by the community)
* Continue to seek out new vendors who want a new way to market and sell their products
* Build a core team of web developers, marketing gurus, and other like-minded creative people to further the site's development.
* **Provide international shipping for products made and sold in the US.**

Right now I have the landing page completed and a few people who sell stuff on Etsy that are interested in selling on Gift Shibe. Right now I need to finish developing the rest of the site and implement the payment system for Dogecoin.

*DISCLAIMER: Products displayed on landing page may or may not be for sale once the site launches and should only considered as placeholders.*

Now for the important part...

**Doge giveaway!**

To participate in the giveaway, please post a comment containing one or more of the following:

* Any suggestions you have for a website like this
* A product/vendor you'd like to see on this site (even if it's your own!)
* Any particular set of skills you might have that you wish to use to help develop this project
* Any questions you might have

There you go! I have 10k to giveaway so we'll make it easy: 100 doge for the first 100 shibes to comment!

I'm not sure if this is actually considered a promotional giveaway or not so I put the tag there just to be safe!

Edit: Here are some of my answers to questions that were posted:

*Right now I'm not planning on having a user interface for sellers but the easiest way people can sell items is to contact me through Reddit or eventually through the site and we can work something out! Any and everyone can sell.*

*As of now the shipping will be handled individually by the sellers. I email them the order information along with a shipping label. All they have to do is drop it off at USPS/UPS/FedEx/etc. and away we go. In the future I'd love to set up some sort of distribution center.*

personalfinance,Any negative to having a balance on a 0% interest credit card?,"I'm in a situation where I spent about $7,500 on my credit card with a $8,000 limit. I immediately made a payment of $5,000 on that card. So the current balance is somewhere around $2,500. The card has 0% interest for the next 10 months or so.

Normally I would be happy to pay off the rest of the card, but the other factor is that I have student loans (around $18K left). The loans have a 3% interest rate. 

I have the money to make payments on either of these, and logic would tell me that it is best to pay a high amount (around $900/month or so) on my loan and just continue to make a minimum payment on the card for the next 10 months-ish until the 0% interest promotion ends. 

Is there any harm in doing this? As long as I pay off the entire balance before the 0% interest promotion ends, will this have any negative effect on my credit rating or anything else? 

I already realize that I must continue to make at least the minimum payment on the card and that I must pay off the balance before the 0% ends. That being the case, should I put my all of my ""spare"" money into the student loan?

I am considering trying to keep the condo and rent it out, because i would like to be closer to school.  Does it make sense to keep the condo and rent or should i just sell and buy something closer to school?  Reason I am thinking of keeping the condo is it's oceanfront property with the potential for a high rent payment and long-term value.  Monthly P and I $1124 and $300 HOA; property tax $310; ins. $100.  Approximate rental income $2300.

We can reach the real estate agent who sold the property to Mom; but is it a good idea to ask her opinion--whether to invest money in renovation, or estimates of property values?

personalfinance,BMO Harris loan modification/origination questions: anyone hire a lawyer to help get their home loan modified? I need one in Chicago. Or good advice.,"I've got a HELO with BMO Harris. It's first-lien, only lien, amortized over 30 years, at 7.24%. Originated in the heady days of 2007. Several years ago, I was laid off from my job when the economy collapsed and have recovered only part of that income (it's getting better, but slowly). I have been trying for two years to get a hardship modification from BMO Harris, based on the fact that my mortgage payment is over 80% of my income, and is therefore unsustainable. Bad for me and bad for them. But they say I can't participate in their Mod/HAMP/HARP programs because my loan isn't a mortgage. When pressed, they tell me that it originated in a different department, and that department doesn't participate in modifications. 

This was not part of the conversation at loan origination.

So, I'm considering hiring a lawyer to help force them to the table. I don't have much leverage (I'm current on payments, never been late), so I'm looking for a lawyer who has been aggressive and successful in going after banks for sloppy originations. In my case, there's probably something there, but I don't even know what that type of lawyer is called (real estate law is too broad to find referrals).

Also, both my immediate and extended family have been investing using this method for over 25 years with similar returns. So I consider this low (at best) to medium (at worst) risk.

My role in this is I compile all their finances quarterly and i typically advise them about their major choices but this is a much complex scenario and i am seeking outside help. 

The home will cost 1.5 million in California.
My parents plan to take a jumbo mortgage and currently are in good credit standing (hover between 760-780). 
The downpayment on the home will be approximately 500k and will be payed through the sell of stocks.
and the interest rate will be 4.15-.25%

Their income is derived from two main sources, my fathers job and rental investment properties. 

My father has his own business which contains many employees. He expects to make 800k from this year from the business (all income before tax) but the business though profitable might end if a contract he has does not get renewed by the end of the year. If this is the case he can still expect to make 450k yearly from the remnants of this business. 

The second source of income is invest properties we have every year. on 45 properties we collect a total rent of 400-600k every year with the total property value being at 6.6 million. Worst case we can sell these properties off but it's a steady stream of income if my father can no longer work, retirement ect.

My own analysis of their income shows that they make around 40,000-60,000 of their income (POST TAX, property taxes on properties ect) monthly. totaling to 600,000 yearly. 

Liabilities- 

On the properties we have loans outstanding of 1 mil at a 3.5% interest rate.

Other assets-
Cash in Bank- 30,000
Stocks (cash liquid in 3 days)- 830,000 (returning avg 8%)
Foreign investments (not liquid)- 500,000 (80% property value will increase 400% to 2 mill 1 year from now but regardless increase significantly.)

Here we are over two years later and we still owe $4500+ on the loan with $275/month payments. I have tried to refinance several times but no one will touch it because the vehicle is a 2006 and has 125k+ miles. The vehicle is also a bit of a gas hog and I go through roughly $260/month in gas. My  husband and I try to throw whatever ""extra"" money we have at it but we don't seem to be making much of a dent!

We have discussed letting this vehicle go back and getting a different vehicle. We were approved for $9000, 12.9%, 48 month term. The vehicle we are looking at is a small sedan, great gas mileage. I estimate it would probably only cost roughly $140 for gas per month. Is this a better or worse option than letting the first vehicle ""go back""?",finance,1401323587

Bitcoin,Feedback on Coinbase job app,"Hey crew, recently dropped an app in for a job with Coinbase as a Legal Associate. The job form had originally asked where Coinbase should file for a Money Transmitting License. I decided to research the issue a bit and use it as my cover letter. I'd like to refine it a bit and use it along with some other apps as a writing sample, wanted to get some feed back:
_____________________________________


There are three scenarios that Coinbase could choose to pursue: 1) Request no-action letters from each state under the theory that Coinbase' activities do not fall within the traditional definitions of a “money transmitter” or fall under one of the state exemptions; 2) File for a MTL in California and Delaware where Coinbase has it principal place and is incorporated, due to the high likelihood of being subject to personal jurisdiction in these states; 3) File for a MTL in all 47 states with legislation on the matter.

Under federal law, 18 UCS § 1960, businesses are required to register for a MTL where their activity falls within the state definition of a money transmitter. Under current legislation 47 states require “money transmitters” to register for an MTL. As stated above, Coinbase principal place of business and state of incorporation is California and Delaware respectively. However, Coinbase' services are available to anyone in the United States regardless of their state of residency. This could very likely subject Coinbase to jurisdiction in every state, or at the very least be forced to close operation in states where it does not comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws.

I. Request for No-Action Letter

Under the first scenario Coinbase could request a no-action letter from each state where it operates. For example: the California Department of Business Oversight (previously the Department of Financial Institutions) in California. Under this theory Coinbase could provide the following argument that its services do not fall within the State's definition of a money transmitter. California law defines “money transmitters” as any business which engages in the activities of: 1. ""selling or issuing payment instruments;"" 2. ""selling or issuing stored value;"" and 3. ""receiving money for transmission"" Cal. Fin. Code § 2003(o).

A. Bitcoin is Not a “Payment Instrument” Under California Law

Coinbase does not operate any services under the first prong of “selling or issuing payment instruments” because bitcoin does not fall within the definition of a “payment instrument” under California law. Payment instruments are defined as “a check, draft, money order, traveler's check or other instrument for the transmission or payment of money or monetary value, whether or not negotiable” Cal. Fin. Code § 2003(q). A payment instrument “does not include a credit card voucher, letter of credit, or any instrument that is redeemable by the issuer for goods and services provided by the issuer or its affiliate."" Id. 

Coinbase is not the “issuer” of bitcoin because an issuer within the context of payment instruments is “the entity that is the maker or drawer of the instrument in accordance with the California Commercial Code and is liable for payment” Cal. Fin. Code § 2003(k). Coinbase is not the maker of bitcoin because bitcoins are created by the network itself after a user provides proof of work solving the mathematical algorithm to unlock new bitcoins. Furthermore, Coinbase is not under any obligation to remain “liable for payment” to any particular user who wishes to redeem their bitcoin for USD or other currency.

Coinbase is not the “seller” of a payment instrument because bitcoin is not an “instrument.” Under the California Commercial Code negotiable instruments “must involve a written instruction or undertaking” Cal. Comm. Code § 3103(a)(6). With a bitcoin transaction there is no written instruction or undertaking, it is simply a transfer of possession of the private keys associated with a particular bitcoin or fraction thereof.

Each bitcoin is a unique piece of property, not a currency, as evidenced by the IRS Notice 2014-21. The ruling treats bitcoin as property, not as an instrument, note, or draft. Each bitcoin is inherently unique because ownership is based purely on possession of specific private keys associated with the bitcoin and authenticated by the public ledger in the Bitcoin network. Once Coinbase has given a user possession of the private keys associated with a bitcoin, Coinbase is no longer under any obligation to transact with that user again or exchange the bitcoin for another currency.

Because Coinbase is not the “issuer” of bitcoin and bitcoin is not a “payment instrument” rather it is unique property, Coinbase is not engaging in activity described in the “payment instrument” prong of the Money Transmitter Act.

B. Bitcoin is Not “Stored Value” as Defined Under California Law

Coinbase is not ""selling or issuing stored value"" Cal. Fin. Code § 2003(o).“Stored value” is defined as an agreement to exchange monetary value for a promise to later redeem that value for a fixed amount, “evidenced by an electronic or digital record” Cal. Fin. Code § 2003(v). Coinbase does not offer redemption value for bitcoins sold to its customers. Coinbase service merely transfers property ownership of the private keys to a bitcoin. At no point in time is Coinbase obligated to redeem any specific stored value because the value of a bitcoin fluctuates wildly with the market. Furthermore, Coinbase is not the “issuer” as discussed above because bitcoin is “issued” by the network's proof of work algorithm and verified by peers in the public blockchain ledger.

C. Coinbase Does Not Accept Funds to Be Transmitted to a Third Party

California Finance Code requires that services ""receiving money for transmission"" register as Money Transmitters Cal. Fin. Code § 2003(o). A service accepts money for transmission where it accepts funds from one user and subsequently transfers those funds to a third party within or outside the United States Cal. Fin. Code § 2003(s). The basis of Coinbase business model is not the transmission of money, nor does it transfer funds, money, instruments, or bitcoin from one user to another. Coinbase purchaces property in the form of each unique bitcoin from its users, Coinbase is then free to keep, sell or destroy that property at will. The fact that Coinbase has simultaneous purchase and sell features does not change the nature of this because at no point in time as any property or bitcoin transmitted anywhere other than from a user to Coinbase, or vice versa.

This conclusion is further evidenced by the Department of Business Oversight's (formerly the DFI) concurrence that “Foreign Currency Exchange Services - Not Subject to money Transmission Act” Available at  HYPERLINK ""http://www.dfi.ca.gov/Laws/orders_files/Opinion-Foreign_Currency_Exchange_Services.pdf""http://www.dfi.ca.gov/Laws/orders_files/Opinion-Foreign_Currency_Exchange_Services.pdf. There the Department concluded that the sale of pesos in exchange for a fee and U.S. Dollars was not a money transmission. This conclusion was drawn because the service did not transmit money to a third party and it did not remain liable to later redeem value for the pesos. The service described in the opinion is strikingly similar to the service offered by Coinbase.

Because Coinbase does not receive money to be transmitted to a third party and it does not obligate itself to later redeem value for a bitcoin, it does not fall under the regulation of this prong of the California Finance Code.

II. File for a Money Transmitting License in California and Delaware

Should regulations emerge that more clearly place bitcoin under any of the definitions described above, it would be prudent for Coinbase to register for a Money Transmitting License in California and Delaware.

Business entities are most likely subject to jurisdiction where they maintain their principal place of business, and often as well in the state of incorporation. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1) provides that ""a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business."" Relatively recently, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the “principal place of business” is the “nerve center” or decision making headquarters of an entity, as opposed to a main place of manufacturing or lower level of operations Hertz Corp. v. Friend, No. 08-1107, slip op. at 1 (U.S. Feb. 23, 2010). 

Because Coinbase main office is located in San Francisco, California and the state of incorporation is in Delaware at the very least Coinbase is subject to jurisdiction and regulation in each state mentioned. Therefore, the first applications for a MTL should be completed in California and Delaware if Coinbase required to comply with money transmitting regulation.

III. File for a Money Transmitting License in all 47 States with Applicable Regulations

The nature of Coinbase business is such that it has users across the nation. At the time of writing 47 states have related legislation regarding money transmission. South Carolina and Montana do not regulate money transmission, New Mexico only regulates “negotiable instruments” which is not applicable to bitcoin, for similar reasons as discussed above. Coinbase possibly avails itself to the laws and regulation of each state it allows customers to transact in. Therefore, Coinbase could be subject to jurisdiction in every state where its services are available. 

Individual analysis of each state's money transmitter regulations are beyond the scope of this document. However, I would be happy to research any specific state or federal regulation in furtherance of the application process and pursuit of employment with Coinbase.",cryptocurrency,1401329489

So I made it through my undergrad with no debt, so this is great, but I'm really debating about whether or not I should go into about $8,000 worth of debt to do a medical assistant program.  At least in Seattle MA's seem to be making between $15-20 an hour, but I'm not sure if this is the wisest choice or what I should be doing with my time. It definitely suits my interest, but if I'm working full time, living in a place that's about $650, plus $250 for food, etc. how long will it take me to pay it off?

I've never been financially independent before, but I do want to jump right into something that will lead to something I'm interested in.  MA's seem to have good hours and gaining clinical experience fits with my future goals.

Can anyone share their experiences?  Some MA positions just require a high school diploma and ""1 year of direct patient care experience,"" does this mean if I am were a CNA for a year I could do a Medical Assistant position?  If so that would be great.  CNA programs are much cheaper and shorter, only about $1,700 and three months or so, they also make about $15 an hour in Seattle, though I've heard there is a lot of poop and old people and I'm not sure how well I would deal with that.

personalfinance,I want to apply for my second credit card but don't have a credit history. Would this be a bad idea with a new hard check on me?

I have only had a credit card for about 5 months now and had no problem being approved for my current card with 11.9% for only a $20 annual fee with what was my primary bank at the time.

I would like to get a rewards card, as I have little problem paying my credit card in full I figure it would be worth it, especially since MBNA has many reward cards with $0 annual fee and then I would keep a secondary low rate card for when I need it. I never applied for a student card as it became apparent to me quickly that banks are just scamming unsuspecting students into using them. MBNA has no policy about who will get approved for what card, something which other places like Capital one do. 

So would this be a good idea to do now? I would like to A) keep current low rate card and get a rewards card. Or B) get a rewards card, and then get MBNAs 9.99% interest rate card which has zero annual fee as well seeing how they are awesome and then cancel my current card.

**Background:** My mother opened up a Perpetual Federal Savings account for me back in October of 1975.  Within the bank book it states that the savings account is representing share interests in Perpetual Federal Savings and Loan Associates and that: ‘dividends are earned from the day of deposit and funds withdrawn earn dividends to the day of withdraw. Dividends are automatically credited to your account quarterly on the last day of December, March, June, and September.’ She put money in the account up until May of 1979 when the divorce between her and my father occurred.  At that point she simply didn’t have the extra money to put in the account and eventually life got in the way and she forgot about it.  In the late 80s (I believe) she went to go back to the bank located at 11th and E Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. only to discovery it had closed.  She gave me the passbook some 10 years ago and from time to time I try to locate any information on the bank or if this money is still around but have been unsuccessful.  I’ve checked all the unclaimed websites but nadda.  The only thing I’ve been able to turn up (that may or may not be correct) is that SunTrust may have been the bank to buy Perpetual Federal Savings.  

**Question to the masses:** Is there anyone here that understands the situation at hand and may have an idea of where I could go to find this money or what happened to it?  I assume with banks, money, and the length of time that it is gone and the bank just took it.  But you never know, right?  I mean 35 years with of interest/dividends may be floating out there so I at least have to check until definitive proof it is gone is located.

worldpolitics,"Obama's ""might doing right"" speech - the stench of hypocrisy is unbearable","http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/05/obamas-might-doing-right-stench-of.html

All America's wars have been bankers wars.
They were fought on behalf of the bankers to maintain or generate additional profits for the privately owned Central Banking cartel.

The recent wars have been fought to protect the petrodollar system which is the source of power to the privately owned Federal Reserve system. 
This was the main reason behind the invasion of Iraq and the Coup against Gaddafi in Libya.

A great video of bankers wars https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5hfEBupAeo4

There have also been many wars fought and Coups made, to steal the natural resources from poor countries. See the CIA coup in Iran 1953 and the more recent wars in Iraq, Libya and Mali.

There have been wars fought to control the distribution routes for oil and gas.
See Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine and the antagonism towards Iran.

Sometimes wars are fought just to get the government into debt by spending more on war to increase the profits of the arms companies and bankers.

Sometimes wars are fought to control the major drug trafficking routes and the profits to be made from laundering drugs money. The war in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Colombia and the Coups in Latin and South America are examples of this.

The main reason for the Spanish-American War was to impose a system of private banking upon the United States. It was started with a false flag propaganda exercise by blaming the Spanish for the sinking of the USS  Maine. The Maine sank due to the munitions on board exploding due to a fire from the boilers - No Spaniard was involved.

American wars for private profit have been going on for a long time.
They are also usually started via a false flag operation of some kind.

I do not know of a war fought by America since Korea (and I don't know much at all about Korea), that was not fought for nefarious intentions - either to increase the profits of bankers and arms companies or to steal resources from poor countries that were rightfully theirs.
The Serbian war is often cited as a ""a good war"" for noble purposes.
But America could of prevented all but the minor beginnings of the Serbian war through a negotiated settlement - but America wanted war in the Balkans and to bomb Serbia.

Obama (and Cheney) can be thought of as the 200lb bully in the schoolyard, stealing the smaller kids lunch money and cell phones.
Putin is the smart savvy 100lb weakling who defeats the bully by getting almost all the other kids in the schoolyard to turn against the bully.

Putin has enlisted the help of China to counteract the aggression towards Russia initiated via Obama's Neocon engineered Coup in Kiev.
China and Russia have accelerated their plans to end the petrodollar system with the help of India, Brazil, South Africa. At least half a dozen other sizable countries are doing non USD trade deals (including Japan and Australia), with dozens more expressing interest.

The BRICS are about to sign a deal to fund the new ""BRICS"" bank with an intial capital of $100bn for international loans.
China has just agreed to set up non USD settlement hubs in London and Frankfurt to marginalize and weaken the USD in international trade.

China and Russia have just signed a new massive $400bn energy deal to supply China with Russian oil and gas.

Russia must also be eying up the possibility of supplying energy to Japan and South Korea and the rest of South East Asia. The countries are paying over market price because of a difficulty and lack of investment in distribution channels.

Russia is planning to spend $18bn on strengthening it's pipeline routes to China.
It must also be eying up the possibility of extending these routes, using China as a transport hub - exactly the same as Ukraine does (or perhaps did) for most of Europe.

Don't get me wrong, I am no fan of the thuggery of Putin. He has murdered journalists in Russia, jailed, exiled and possibly murdered Oligarchs who turned against him.

But Putin's thuggery is calculated, whereas Obama's and Cheney's thuggery are on a massive and wanton scale.

Almost all those who gain the levers of power (or who merely exercise that power on behalf of others that wield power behind the scenes) have gained that power by being ruthless and capable of great crimes.

Major recognizable figures of power, that increased the power of their country are often termed ""Statesmen"".
It is usually only the people that increased national power and the relative wealth of their people over the longer term that are remembered in the history books. The losers are usually forgotten - history is always written by the winners and it often takes a series of bad leaders to substantially weaken a great power - the legacy of what made them a great power in the first place has to be overcome before the rot really sets in.

Just about every ""Statesman"" in history was a ruthless thug.
The difference between a Statesman and a loser is therefore whether the thuggery was calculated and successful or misguided and wanton. (Some of the losers in history were just plain stupid or crazy, a mere handful were smart ""good"" men.)

Major successful ""Statesmen""

Genghis Khan
United the disparate numerous small tribes in Mongolia who were fighting each other and turned them into the greatest land army the world has ever seen.
Garnered the largest ever contiguous land empire which stretched from Beijing to Kiev.
Used a combination of threats and bribes to achieve his ambitions. He would massacre the entire population of one city to ensure that the next several acquiesced quietly to his rule.
Was very astute at picking subordinates. When the last general personally chosen by Genghis Khan dies, the Mongol Empire started it's decline.
When his leading general and ally from Genghis's earliest beginnings rebelled and was defeated, Genghis Khan offered him clemency despite the major threat to his rule that he posed. His general refused and was executed. 

Alexander the Great
Built an Empire that stretched from Southern Europe to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Egypt.
Shared the spoils of war with his generals and followers - he wasn't too greedy.
After his first major success to defeat the Persians he destroyed their power center - Persepolis.
In mitigation, Alexander married a Persian princess despite being blatantly gay.
A great tactician, strategician and motivator of men.
He was also imaginative - when geography blocked his route one time - he sent spies out to find someone to bribe who knew the lay of the land and go round his enemy to attack them from behind.

Elizabeth 1
Inherited a realm in great peril from a far superior enemy and in internal disarray from religious conflicts.
Not only did she ensure England's survival but she also reduced her enemies power and increased England's.
Showed tolerance (for the times) in religious differences.
Pinpricked at the Spanish with guerrilla actions and piracy, which gained many domestic allies and much needed gold.
Picked astute advisers - Robert Dudley, Earl of Essex being an aberration. Her best advisers and military commanders were commoners - operated a primitive system of meritocracy.
Laid the groundwork for England's future dominance of Europe.
Repaired the great damage done by her vain, profligate, tempestuous, war mongering and loser father - Henry VIII.

Henry VII
Much neglected by history and often portrayed as a villain for being a usurper.
Brought to an end 100 years of civil war in England and achieved both stable governance and the restitution of England's Treasury through prudent and non-profligate economic policies.
Was not a war mongering adventurer after he won power.
Struck a careful balance between the interests of York and Lancaster and married the leading lady of the opposing side - Elizabeth of York.

Thomas Jefferson and the Founding Fathers
Laid the groundwork for America to become the greatest power on Earth through their system of three branches of government (""men are no angels"") and the limits set on the Federal Government as laid out in the Bill of Rights - ""the Constitution's principle of federalism by providing that powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the States, are reserved to the States or the people.
Defeated a far superior force in the Revolutionary War, despite early on looking like certain losers.
Had a policy of encouraging trade but avoiding foreign entanglements and foreign wars.
When directly attacked they responded - e.g. Jefferson founded the US Navy and launched a guerrilla raid to wipe out Tunis in response to attacks by the Barbary pirates on US merchant ships (after previous extensive diplomatic efforts had failed).

Deng Xiaoping (China)
Fought against Mao's mindless and insane total communism to institute a partial system of property owning rights and capitalism.
China's development from it's dire poverty in 1980 to today's economic power house needs no further elaboration.
China is full of corruption and still full of mindless central planning but it's amazing what even a small dose of actual capitalism can do for a country.

The above major historical figures have much in common, despite their obvious and extreme differences and cultural backgrounds.

They ruled their people in a spirit of consensus and tolerance - not by force.
Adopted non divisive policies - made their people more united. 
They weren't too greedy, they made their people more prosperous not just themselves and their elite cronies.
The end result was that they made their country much more powerful.

The Modern Day
America is about to elect Hillary Clinton who will finish off what Cheney and Obama have started - the complete ruination of America as the economic powerhouse. (Jeb Bush would do just as well.)

There is no doubt that America has become very significantly weaker as a direct result of the policies of the Federal Government and Federal Reserve over the last 15 years (the rot started 100 years ago).

Meanwhile Putin continues to make Russia stronger from the dire state Russia was in, in 2000 when he gained power.
China also continues to become stronger (there is a sharp setback to come in the fairly near future).

America and Europe are now the worse governed major areas of the world for economic development and prosperity and this trend is only set to accelerate in the future with the disastrous policies of their current governments and their Central Banks.",finance,1401370175

dogecoin,Spend your time and your doge wisely.,"*I ended up posting this in response to people [accusing me of dishonesty when I proposed a charity campaign. /u/Fulvio55 suggested I post it as its own thread, so here it is. I think it's kind of soapboxy and annoying, but I think it's important, too, so whatever.*

So I don't feel like I really fall into either the Libertarian Bitcoin camp or the Venture Capitalist Bitcoin camp. I'm interested in the idea of organizing labor through post internet methods like Dogecoin. I tend to agree with Gabe Newell when he says that corporations are a pre-internet way of organizing labor.

So Valve essentially functions in a non-heiarchical fashion, where everyone chooses what projects to work on. But they have the luxury of being able to choose who joins the organization. We don't have that luxury. What we do have is a few devoted individuals who have developed, promoted, and built an infrastructure for doge. These people frequently get shouted at when they do something. I don't know why this is. We also have a couple dozen people participating in Doge4Doge, and those people are heroes.

This is how a decentralized labor force is going to work: Everyone chooses how to spend their time, and their Doge. Each person is responsible for figuring out what their talents are, and how to apply them.

But, oh my goodness, we are gold. We are a marketer's ultimate dream. Here we are, willing to engage with brands for days at a time. NASCAR has never seen someone vote 85,000 times. Why do you think McDonalds has built a custom captcha for us? There isn't a fanbase on the planet that can promote brand engagement like we can.

But we can be so much more.

There's a portion of Dogecoin users, I would even venture to say a majority, who are willing to spend money in order to support businesses, in order to support the shibeconomy. Do you know how crazy that is? The Federal Reserve has literally been working since its inception to to try and get people to do this. Most people don't do this. The fact that we do this is a remarkable thing. Initiatives like Doge4Doge and [this user's](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/26myvr/1_doge_1_cent_our_charity_can_make_this_happen/chsrgo0) plan are the first steps towards developing this. I read a study the other day: it said a minority of people have donated to charity in the last year. I bet for doge it's above 75%. It's an incredible challenge to try and exist in an economy where every action aids everyone: to try and think in a way where each business plan helps the individual, the business, and the larger society, all simultaneously. We will either meet this challenge or we will be remembered as the people to got closer to anyone before it to meeting these challenges.

I'm fine with engaging with large, corporate brands like McDonalds or NASCAR (I love engaging with brands like PPR). I just think that large brands should bring something to the table that transcends a voting app that we can win. Winning votes is great, but it has to be something that we do on the side, when we need to. If it is our raison d'etre than we might as well just be votecoin.

Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that everyone needs to choose how to spend their time. For every Shibe working hard to build Doge, there are 10 pups howling at them to do something different. When I have an idea for something, I don't ask someone else to do it. I work on it until I can't anymore, and then I ask for help. I believe that this kind of decentralized economy can work.

I also believe that it is working. The stuff that we accomplished with Josh Wise is nothing less than incredible. We have many unique Doge businesses, amazing Doge services. We have a functional economy for goods and services. Yes, it's unreliable, and it functions on doge time, and it's sort of mildly spectrum disorder, but dammit, it's working. We've done amazing things so far. Just like always, there's wolves, and just like always, there's huge bottomless pits that we might fall into, but just like always, we're gonna beat them.

personalfinance,Just received my student loan repayment papers in the mail. May i have a little advice?,"So I received a couple of envelopes from Fedloan Services saying I will need to begin paying my student loans back. I will do my best to provide the best and most accurate information possible of my current situation. 

The numbers on the Student Loans:

* [Loans](http://i.imgur.com/ZDGR5H4.jpg?1) **edit: there's $6,114.82 added in interest on top of these figures.**

I also have a secured loan set up at my local credit union to repair my credit from some medical bills I did not pay. It is $1,100.00 at 3%. Basically they borrowed versus what I had in savings and I make monthly payments on it and they report the payments to creditors and in the end I have better credit than what i started at the cost of 3%. Payments are $97.00

**My main questions:**

* I want to pay this off as soon as possible, which ones should I focus on or prioritize more on?


* How would I pay more towards a principle versus interest and when is the earliest i can realistically pay them off?


* Would making these payments help my credit score and allow me to cancel my secured loan that is building my credit? or should i just keep it?
 

* I was looking at purchasing a more fuel efficient/safer car, my current truck is from the 80's and sucks down gas, my girlfriend's family would be willing to sell me a 2002 honda civic for ~ $2,000.00. I have $1,600.00 saved. Would i be better suited to use it for my loans or keep it for a rainy day or other? I only commute 16 miles to work all freeway, 8 minutes total to get there and 8 back. I avoid traffic because my shift starts an hour earlier and ends an hour earlier than most, and my gym is down the street. 






My income:
I work full 40 hours a week at $12.00/HR as a helpdesk 1 in california (started in late February). $960 a check before taxes, contributing 12% to company 401(k) also before taxes. and i have my checks direct deposit to two accounts, one savings and one checking with two different banks. Each split is usually from 330-380 depending on how much taxes are taken out. The savings are not touched and i've currently saved 1,600 in just over two months. The checking is used for the bills and what's left is used for whatever else may come.

Current Monthly ""Bills"":
Gym memberships for GF and myself - $35.00 ($20.00 beginning of month, $15.00 end of month, two separate accounts i just pay for them)

Company Smartphone - because of my position in the company I am allowed a monthly stipend of $125 dollars (taxes are taken from it) to buy a smartphone data plan. I currently use it for a 4gb data plan through at&amp;t for $101.39/month  but only really use 2gb (and thats pushing it hard)

House tax - still live with parents but they began charging me as soon as i became full time to live with them and help out. $200 isn't bad I get an insured truck, even if it is a POS. All my meals prepped for me including brunch, midday snack, second lunch and everything in between. Clothes cleaned, internet the works. Not complaining here I know its a steal and would easily pay a little more.

Gas - a tank or two here or there ~$70.

any other info you guys need, just lemme know. 

Thanks a million!

Also, wasn't expecting this to come so soon. I just left school, a different one than where these loans came from, and started my full time job in FEB. People are quick when there is money on the line lol.",finance,1401382391

My wife bought a condo in a suburb of Chicago in late 2008. She paid $198k for a 2 Bed/2 Bath unit. Many of the other tenants are older folks who probably purchased their units in 1975-1980. Some units have sold for as low as $150k recently. We owe $170k still on our mortgages. 

We'd like to move out and buy a home while interest rates are low, however do not want to take a loss on our current condo. There is a possibility of renting it out, but that would put us in a position of owning two properties which I really would like to avoid doing. 

Do we take the chances trying to sell and potentially take a loss before trying to go out and purchase a home? 

Our savings is fairly strong, we have $116k in cash. Little to no credit card debt which we pay off every month. 

Please let me know if any additional information would help provide advice. Thanks!",finance,1401383525

personalfinance,Should I empty my 401k to pay off my credit card?,"I'm 24 (as of a couple months ago) have been full-time employed making an okay amount of money for 5 years now. My employer matches 15% I think... I've put in around $3500 and it's up to $4000. I don't put a lot in a month because I'm sort of under the impression that 401ks should be counted as money you could lose as soon as the economy collapses. On top of that I have a lot of medical bills so that's where a majority of my spare cash goes. I have about $4000 exactly in credit card debt from the last 6 years of renting 2 different places/furniture/mental health vacation and then buying a house late 2012.

It's been about 4000 for the last 2 years as every-time I get spare money I end up paying off past medical bills or something else. (several knee surgeries and some other stuff) I put a big chunk of my tax return into it and like $500 and that's all been filled up after a couple medical bills caught up with me. That an the minimum payment I have to make is around $100. I got it in 2008 as like a student card so the interest rate is around 9%

So...should I just close my 401k and pay it off so i don't have this monthly payment? I've been hard on money recently. I don't really spend a lot as the only budget I can cut into is my food budget and that is like $50 a week. Maybe like $50 a month I spend on entertainment at the absolute most.

personalfinance,Student Seeking to Become Independent of Parents. Please Help!,"Hello! 

I am currently a rising junior at a private university in the United States, and I desperately want to become independent of my parents for personal reasons that I won't go into detail about at this time, so I would like to begin paying for my own tuition. I have emailed back and forth a bit with my university's financial aid office, and while it was some help, I am still a little uncertain of what I should do or if I can even afford the tuition on my own. 

My total subsidized loans add up to $7,920 and my unsubsidized loans add up to $3,960 so far. I have been granted a university award, which is $5,000 per year for four years. My general college scholarship adds up to $47,825, and my federal pell grant adds up to $10,245. All of these are the totals up through this last semester. It also says that I have a federal supplemental grant that totals at $3,000. Finally, the monthly payment plan totals up to $4,900 so far. 

The woman in the financial aid office with whom I spoke told me the following information verbatim: 
""Paying back your loans you will go through your servicer which is Sallie Mae (www.salliemae.com). Once you graduate you will have a grace period of 6 months before you have to start paying those back. Of course, you can always start you payments earlier. 

This year you have a total aid award of $43,545 including your loans and work study. Your total direct costs are $44,630. Subtracting the work-study the amount due after your aid is $4,980 for the year. If you like you can sign up for the Tuition Management at [my university's tuition management site] to divide that remainder amount by 10 months. That would leave you at about a total of $498 per month. The work-study dollars you will earn each month and you could put this toward your monthly payment. The first payment begins June 1st. If you are unable to make it by this deadline you can pay 2 payments instead by July 1st.
Also, please remember you will have to fill out your loan request form for $7,500 and turn that in to our office as soon as possible.""

I will be studying abroad in the fall, so I won't receive my work-study aid during that time, but in the spring it will add up to $865 for the semester. I also don't believe that I will begin to pay my until that time. This summer I have estimated that I will make around $1000 through babysitting, which is thankfully tax-free, and I plan to save as much of that as I can for my study abroad and tuition. 

While I don't know if I can pay on my own, I have thought about this for a long time, and I think it will be the best for me in the long run. So, /r/personalfinance, can you help me? I know this is pretty general and probably a lot of numbers to take in, but I am kind of lost at the moment. Any kind of advice, general or specific, is more than welcome!

CryptoCurrency,Legal issues with accepting bitcoin legal blog post. Any additions/corrections?,"Hey guys, about to post this to the legal blog on lawkick.com. You guys have any additions/corrections? Feedback welcome as well.

**The Bitcoin Rundown**
Bitcoin continues to capture the attention of venture capitalists, retail businesses, government regulators, the media, and politicians over five years after its inception. Despite the recent shutdown of Mt. Gox (formerly the largest Bitcoin exchange), and subsequent drop in the Bitcoin exchange rate, the crypto-currency is still growing in acceptance and use. More and more businesses are starting to accept them in-lieu of traditional currency, and the United States is starting to issue regulations and guidelines concerning their use as a currency. However, many legal issues lurking behind crypto-currencies remain, and untangling them is still a work in progress. This article will cover the basics of Bitcoin, where it is today, and then turn to the legal issues surrounding its use.

**Bitcoin Basics**
So what do we know? Bitcoin is the most popular of a number of virtual crypto-currencies, a form of money with no physical presence. Owners of Bitcoins can sell them for traditional currency to other users, through online exchanges. Bitcoins can also be used in some stores or websites in exchange for goods and services, and some technologists accept them directly in exchange for services like web design and development. Today, Bitcoin is the target of venture capital investment, criticism, praise, and confusion. Marc Andreessen, a software engineer turned venture capitalist in the technology space, has invested over $50 million in Bitcoin start-ups, and he’s not alone. Some estimate the total capital investment in the Bitcoin space will reach $300 million by the end of 2014. Moreover, companies already accepting Bitcoin include Overstock.com, Virgin Galactic, Wordpress, Reddit, Zynga, Tigerdirect, Stripe merchants, and at least one Tesla dealer. Law firms are starting to get in on the action too, as a firm in Houston and Illinois started accepting Bitcoins as payment last year.

**Legality of Accepting Bitcoin and Taxes**
With all this interest brewing, it’s about time the legal issues surrounding Bitcoin’s use are cleared up. Foremost, is accepting Bitcoins as payment legal? It is, provided one follows the new guidelines provided by the IRS for tax purposes. As of March 2014, the IRS classifies Bitcoin and other virtual currencies as property, rather than currency, and transactions over $600 are taxed the same way the agency treats property transactions. This includes payments, gains realized from investing in Bitcoins, and income derived from producing the Bitcoins (known as “mining”). The Bitcoins must be valued at their “fair market value,” according to the IRS, which can be based on the going prices at the online exchanges. This can be problematic, as Bitcoin prices fluctuate daily, and sometimes for significant percentages. Additionally, if used as payments to employees or contractors, it must be listed on their W-2 or 1099 forms. These payments are subject to the same information reporting that any property payment is.

**Specific Problem for Lawyers Accepting Bitcoin**
Bitcoins fluctuation in price can be problematic for any company, but pose a special challenge for lawyers. On one end of the spectrum, a price drop can leave the lawyer working for almost nothing, but the biggest problem is on the other end of the spectrum. A price increase could cause the lawyer’s rate to become “unconscionable,” a violation of their ethical duty as a lawyer to avoid charging excessive fees. Such a rate is unable to be retained if the client sues, and may even expose the lawyer to sanction liability.

**The Bitcoin Refund Issue**
For merchandisers especially, Bitcoin also presents an issue for returns and exchanges. Say someone purchases one Bitcoin worth of stuff when the spot price is $600, but later decides to return it, or the product is defective. If the value of a Bitcoin increased to $700 or decreased to $500, one of the parties is going to lose out. In fact, if the price of a Bitcoin increases, it creates a moral hazard by incentivizing the customer to return the product for the Bitcoin. Overstock.com has chosen to solve this issue by offering in-store credit for returns, and places the risk of currency fluctuation on the customer by limiting that credit to the exchange rate at time of purchase.

**Conclusion**
Today, accepting Bitcoin as payment is still tricky. Before doing so, I suggest finding a lawyer to ensure your business complies with federal, state, and local laws. Lawkick can be your essential tool for finding the right lawyer for your needs.",cryptocurrency,1401401300

personalfinance,Newly married couple trying to sort out their finances. Need some advice.,"Hello r/pf. My wife and I (we're 26/27) just married a couple weeks ago and we're now trying to sort out our finances. We've been living together for a few years so we're well aware of each other's financial situations and we pay our bills together just fine but there's a few things still up in the air. Here's our current scenario:

**Income:**
- I make a guaranteed $42k at the moment. One unpredictable bonus and (a lot) of overtime not included. Probably closer to $48k+ all said and done.
- She was working on a year-to-year basis as a contract employee making around $18k during the school year and also working a part-time job later in the day making around $200/week (which turns full-time in the summers) making closer to $600/week.

**Primary debts:**  
We have three credit cards between us:  
1. Balance of ~$5,100, currently no interest. Will eventually go up to about 12% interest starting in the next 8-12 months (when the promotional offer ends).  
2. Balance of ~$2,400. Around 18% APR.  
3. Balance of ~$2,000. Also around 18% APR.  
Other debts:  
- I have a student loan of around $2,700 that I pay $75/month to (minimum is $40) with an interest rate of 5%.  
- I also have an auto loan that costs me $250/month but there's not much that can be done about that.

**Other stuff:**
We recently received around $7k from our wedding. For now it's being saved for our honeymoon for spending money (the trip itself is paid for, I'm referring to food, shopping, etc). 
My wife found out days after our wedding that her contract job was not being renewed (she still has the part-time one). Shitty timing obviously however through this employer she had a pension which we're hoping she'll be able to cash out to the tune of around $6k. We're planning to save this as emergency money (along with what's left of the wedding money post-honeymoon) until she has a new, stable job. 
I just got a new 0% interest credit card and I requested to have the balance of card 3 transferred to it (still waiting to find out if it was approved). I'm hoping to do the same thing for card 2.

**Advice I'm looking for:**  
- Credit cards: My biggest concern is the three credit cards. I'm hoping once she has a new job, we can throw the entire pension at card #1 to instantly cut our debt in half. Then use the snowball method to pay off the other two. Obviously this depends on her getting a new job soon. The more we need the emergency money, the less we'll have to pay off the card(s) with. Also, is transferring to new, 0% APR cards smart or will I end up with too many (and is that bad)?  
- Married couples: How do you merge your moneys? Currently we have a joint checking account just for paying rent (direct deposited every paycheck) and then we each have our own checking/savings accounts. Do you find it's easier to just merge everything and dump all your money into one checking account? Should we still have our own for anything? Other suggestions?  
- Savings: Basically none. I'd really like us to be able to save more once we get some debts paid off and eventually have some money to invest. I have a 401k through work that does very well for me but I'd like more than that for the future; both investment money and savings in the bank. I'm assuming there's not much to advise us other than pay off the debts first and then start saving, but I'd like to see what people have to say anyway.  
- Neither of us think that we're so strapped for cash we need to budget everything out line by line but any general advice would be appreciated. I'm definitely going to fire up my old mint.com account and start paying better attention to where all our money is going plus add her accounts in so we can get a real idea of out financial portfolio.

ethereum,Blockchain rent and the cost of storing information forever,"Hello all,

/u/vbuterin's [recent blog post](http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/27/what-if-ethereum-lived-on-a-treap-or-blockchains-charging-rent/) ([reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/26ln6e/what_if_ethereum_lived_on_a_treap_or_blockchains/)) about the possibility of having the blockchain charge ""rent"", got me thinking about the implications of blockchain cleanup and I wanted to share these with you to gather your feedback.

Two main points:

* Avoiding the cost of computing and enforcing ""rent"" and the complexities around that
* The philosophical implications of deleting (evicting!) contracts after their funds run out.

My thinking is that in order to avoid the cost of computing ""rent"" with all the problems it comes with as described in the article, I think a relatively more simple way would be to charge the contract with the Net Present Value (NPV) of all future rent payments of storing a piece of information, and if the owner decides to delete the contract (and the contract allows him/her to do that), well, they could get some coins back (NPV from the point of cancellation on). This should incentivize blockchain cleanup by owners. Given the cost of storage should tend to zero, storing small pieces of information forever should not be an issue, and node operators would live off the fees their charge for alive contracts. Past information stored in the blockchain is an asset that generates new contracts, traffic and influx of fees.

For example, if we consider Google Cloud redundant [standard storage fee](https://developers.google.com/storage/pricing) of $0.026/GB/month, and let's say we pay 10 times that for even more redundancy, or $0.26/GB/month, the cost per byte per month would be $0.26/(2^30) = $0.000000000242/byte/month, and a 32-byte Ethereum block (like a hash) would cost $0.00000000775/month. The Net Present Value cost of storing this information *forever*, [a perpetuity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetuity) in financial terms, assuming an average annual interest rate of 3% including inflation, would be NPV = yearly_cost / yearly_interest = $0.00000000775 * 12 / 0.03 = $0.0000031. This is very small, and we are not even taking into account the deflation of storage cost over time.

Therefore, I think it is best to charge this upfront fee when storing information and avoid the problem of having an expensive and complex algorithm to clean up. At the same time, I understand the blockchain as a sort of notary. I am not sure if present-day notaries can destroy the documents they notarize. I think they have to store them forever.

Another philosophical thought is that the blockchain with all its contracts belongs to the History of Humankind, and why is the Internet Archive capturing periodic snapshots of the entire Web?. We want to keep record of everything that happens, not delete it. Imagine the blockchain had existed 1000 years ago, you could review contracts [like these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_treaties#Before_AD_1200) with cryptographic precision!

I am a recent high school graduate, and I am in a bit of a pickle. This September I will be attending Tribeca Flashpoint.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, Deflation and the End of Top-Down Consumerism","I had a ""shower thought"" the other day about bitcoin while doing some gardening and thought I'd run it by you folks and maybe get some discussion going. I'm going to try and flesh out my original train of thought in a few paragraphs so this could get long, but feel free to skip to the TL;DR below if you're short on time.

There seems to still be a lot of hand-wringing among both critics and supporters of bitcoin regarding the currency's deflationary nature. I don't want to re-hash all the related arguments here in detail as they have already been well articulated [elsewhere](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deflationary_spiral), but suffice it to say many observers of the bitcoin space, especially classically-trained economists, are eager to pronounce doom for the future of bitcoin as a currency because it does not have the ""desirable"" property of being inflationary.

Why is an inflationary currency ""desirable,"" you ask? Well, one of the arguments frequently trotted out by the the aforementioned skeptics is that an inflationary currency is good because it impels holders of the currency to spend it before its devalued over time by inflation, thereby stimulating spending and stimulating the economy as a whole. This was also the same argument that both the Federal Reserve and especially the Abe administration in Japan made when they started their respective quantitative easing programs. In particular, the Abe administration and the Bank of Japan have stated that they will pump as much money into the system as needed to ensure that the ""economic evil"" of deflation is defeated.

And yet, as someone who is very much ~~skeptical of~~ disgusted with consumerism for consumerism's sake, I find this line of thinking really disturbing. Sure, on paper it's ""good"" for the economy if Mr. Tanaka goes out and buys a new Toshiba OLED TV with his quickly-depreciating yen, but if Mr. Tanaka already has a perfectly-working TV he bought two years ago and would not have bought the new TV without being ""induced"" to do so by the threat of his cash becoming increasingly worthless, is the transaction really occurring on a purely voluntary basis (i.e. based on the fact that Mr. Tanaka just wants a new TV) or is there some measure of unnatural coercion taking place, distorting the market? As you can probably guess, I think the latter is more true than the former. The fact of the matter is, a lot of people buy a lot of garbage they don't need due to the coercive nature of an inflationary currency and inflationary currency plays a non-trivial role in supporting our modern consumerist society.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, may produce the opposite effect as a deflationary store of value: if Mr. Tanaka holds bitcoin instead of yen, he won't be so easily manipulated by a central authority into coerced consumption. In fact, the opposite is true: if bitcoin generally appreciates it may produce an *anti*-consumerism effect whereby Mr. Tanaka will only buy a new TV if he actually really, really needs one. Obviously Toshiba doesn't like this since they actually have to try much harder to innovate and convince people that they need new TVs, but I would argue that this is a good thing for the environment and innovation since less external waste is generated and Mr. Tanaka is empowered to build his own wealth rather that remain stuck in the work-consume hamster wheel.

If you believe like I do that rampant consumerism is a bad thing, the above bitcoin-induced effect is already really awesome and a great reason to support bitcoin, but I think bitcoin may be an *even more* potent force for destroying the cancer of thoughtless consumerism by virtue of the fact that the ability to send money instantly and cheaply to anyone, anytime and anywhere could potentially reduce the role that advertising plays in modern society as a way of monetizing information and entertainment. 

Just think of all the content services that most people use on a daily basis that are supported by advertising: TV, radio, magazines and a good chunk of the internet. Imagine instead a world where all of these content services are built on mandatory (pay-per-view) microtransactions instead of advertising. Instead of having Mr. Tanaka buy Asahi beer, which pays Fuji News to run ads so Mr. Tanaka buys more beer in an endless cycle of pointless consumerism, Mr. Tanaka can just pay Fuji News in bitcoin for the right to view their content and buy Asahi beer on a purely rational basis (i.e. when he naturally wants to) rather than when he’s been brainwashed by endless advertising to do so. 
Thus, I think bitcoin could become a powerful force for dismantling the inefficient and soul-crushing consumerist society that we all live under, and it’s deflationary nature has an important part to play in inducing the changes needed for this to happen.
 
I know that the above argument is very rough around the edges and could probably be refined and improved by smarter people than me, so I ask you, /r/bitcoin, do you think bitcoin could potentially become a powerful force for re-aligning our ideology as a society away from consumerism to something more meaningful and fulfilling, or am I being to optimistic and naïve here?

TL;DR: I think that bitcoin, by virtue of being a deflationary currency and enabling seamless, instant transactions has the potential to subvert the consumerist dogma of our current society, but on the other hand maybe I’m wrong and just inhaled too much pollen while gardening earlier.",cryptocurrency,1401419307

Obviously, I've been paying the highest loans down first, but it's still a little slow.

I was wondering if there's any negatives to consolidating to SoFi at, what it's reported by Credit Karma, is a 2.66% APR over 60 months for the full $38k. None of my loans have anywhere near that interest rate... So it sounds a little fishy to me, I just wanted to check with people here.

Ok so general picture:

+ College senior, engineering major
+ Need to borrow $5k 
+ So far, $40k in student debt, all in in-school deferment till 6 months after graduation in August
+ Part time student job pays $11/hr,  with 10-12hrs/wk typical. So around $220/mo. (There aren't many hours to be had and even if there were, school dominates my time)
+ Living with mom so no rent/bills at the moment
+ Credit score 650
 
So, I *could* ask my mom to be my cosigner and she would do it in a hearbeat, but I already feel like such a bummy leech living off her and she has her own debt and I'm not sure how good her credit is, although it was good enough to lease a vw jetta. So I'd really like to not tangle her up in my mess, but I know it's pretty low chance for students to get approved on their own. 

So based on all that, do I have the slightest chance in qualifying on my own?

* My credit score was a bit over 700 a year ago. 
* I don't use credit cards anymore. I've looked into a balance transfer but I'm not sure how the fees apply (3% charged by who? Chase and American Express? The new card servicer? Both?)
* If I don't end up doing a balance transfer, I'll call American Express to see if I can lower the rate. 
* I pay ~$500 [ZipCar] for my SO to drive him home from work and to hang out after he gets out from work. I think this amount will go down by roughly $50 because I signed up for ZipCar's 12.5% discount rate. 
* I live in downtown San Francisco, which should explain the stupidly high rent and food. 
* My overall plan is to build up a large amount of cash to cover my statuatory expenses, of which I did not include rent. If push comes to shove [I lose my primary job] I will likely move back with my parents and use my cash reserves to service my mandatory debt while my parents rearrange themselves to help cover it. 
* The Nelnet (~50k) student loans are in my father's name. I am not sure whether I was a co-signer but I don't see it on my credit reports. 
* I have, not listed above, $2,200 tied up in a security deposit for this apartment. My rent is month-to-month. I am hesitant to look for a cheaper apartment because I don't want to tie up more money in a security deposit. I haven't trashed the place but they have 21 days by statute to get it back, so it's very illiquid. The way I see it, I can handle about 0.5 emergencies right now. If I get evicted without cause, I can handle that. If I lose my job, I can handle that (by moving back home), but if I lose my job right after I get a new apartment I will have just signed a lease, tied up funds, etc. Massive headache. 
* My employer offers 4% matching 401(k), so that's already been deducted from the above stuff and I'm pretending it doesn't exist (just started doing it this month). 
* I am skating a bit thin on the income velocity when you put to one side my second job - about a third of my surplus income (and over half of my net worth velocity) is because of this extra $400/month. Income is income but the second job is secondary, and in a sense less reliable. If it wasn't for that, I'd be running on a $800/month margin. 

My basic plan, assuming I don't lose my job or housing, is to build up 12-15k in e-fund, representing 3-4 months of normal expenses, or about 12 months of statuatory expenses. I currently have 6.5k, or just under 2 months of normal expenses, or 7 months of statuatory expenses. I'd like to double my runway. That should happen, given my income velocity, in 8 months. If I don't do a balance transfer, then I will accumulate roughly 750 in interest in that time. I'll then pay off the credit cards (20.24% and 13.99%) in a few months, and then start attacking the loans in order of APR, highest first. All this time I will be putting in 4% (fully matched and vested) = ~$270/month of my pre-tax income into my 401(k).

Since I'm pretty stupid when it comes to this stuff I have so many dumb questions I would like help on:

 - Essentially these are IRA's correct? I can only put in $5500 a year? or is there a way I can contribute more?
 - Is this the best retirement option? are there concerns I could consider with this plan?
 - Do I have the option between traditional and roth? if so what would be the best option for me assuming I keep the same salary adjusting for inflation.
 - In the case that I lose my job am I required to contribute a certain amount to the fund each year?
 - What are current interest rates? would I be able to track this as time goes on? What is a average interest rate for a fund like this?
 - Is there a chance I can lose all my money? is this a pretty safe retirement option?
 - Is interest applied annually, monthly, continuously? and will I be able to see how much I'm making and what the interest rates are?

personalfinance,Would appreciate advice: holding cash or reducing debt,"Hi all, I would love some advice from the helpful folks here. My general question is whether I am stock piling too much cash for a future investment, when I have other things I could pay down with the capital.


About me: I am 32, married, no kids, and own a 2-family house. We are very comfortable and live a pretty modest lifestyle. I earn about $140k a year, and wife makes $35k. I am currently maxing my 401k and getting a generous match from my employer (which adds up to a match of ~17% of my base  salary on top of the 12% I am saving). My total retirement savings is $253k.


I have about $15k in student loans which are at 2% interest rate. My mortgage is for ~$405k at 4.375% (this was actually a good rate for a multifamily), and I bought my home with 20% down. My total mortgage/interest/insurance is around $2500 and my rental brings in $1200. We save about $2k a month after all is said and done (not counting my annual bonus, tax return, etc). 


My total cash in savings is around $160k. $15k is invested in an index fund, as I've gotten anxious keeping it all in cash.


My plan about 5 years back was to buy a multi-family house, live there for a while, and then save up and buy a single family house for us and keep the multi as a source of income. However for the time being, we really love our home, and have no intentions of moving. My thinking is to instead potentially buy another multi-family house (2 or 3 unit) which goes anywhere for $600-900k in my area. So I have been slowing building up the cash savings and entertaining the idea of buying again in the next several years, as a 20% down payment alone could be ~$180k and I would want to keep at least $20-30k in emergency reserves.


I see others on this sub making ""an extra mortgage payment a year"" and ""wiping out all my debt"" and it honestly always gives me a moment of pause to think about whether or not I am doing the right thing. The thinking is that if I pay down my debt (which all seem at reasonable interest rates) I will significantly set back any plans of buying another investment. Further, if I were to loan money for an investment property, the rate would definitely be higher than 4.375% (my current mortgage rate) because investment properties carry higher rates. 


All this to say I feel we are in a very fortunate situation, and I am generally comfortable with what we are doing. However there seem to be many intelligent people on this sub, who are more sophisticated than I, and I am genuinely curious if they think my plan makes sense. I have thick skin, so feel free to be as candid as you like, as it wouldn't surprise me to hear I am being an idiot! :) Thanks.",finance,1401458344
personalfinance,Help figuring out financial plan for college debt,"Hey guys. As the title says, I'm looking for help developing a financial plan for the future. 

I'm a 20 year old computer science major with 2 years left to go in my college career. College is mainly the source of all my worries, because I'm taking out about $30k a year in loans. (Federal and Sallie Mae.) My parents have promised to pay off the interest payments of all my loans until I get through college, and my grandfather also helps out with loan payments in exchange for good grades. 

When I'm in school, I work part time in the campus store which is more than enough to provide for food/entertainment costs. Generally, I'm very frugal and don't spend money often. (With the exception of food, obviously.)

This Summer, I am participating in study abroad, which kills any chance I have at an internship/summer job. I plan on looking for and working an internship next Summer, that will most likely be paid. My school also has a lot of job placement services that I will plan on using to get this internship and a job once I graduate.

However, financially, I don't have much of a plan. I would consider myself fairly ambitious in my financial goals - I would love to move into a condo/apartment with my SO (or my own house if luck somehow works out) ASAP after getting a good job, while still being able to pay off my debt in a timely manner. Added to this, I want to take responsibility for my health insurance/cell phone bill/car insurance once I get a good job.

As for my current finances/financial history, there's not too much to say. I have both a checking and savings account, but I have not started an emergency fund or anything yet. (It's not needed currently. I may start doing this within the next semester.) I know that my credit score is &gt;700, as I am very diligent in paying off my credit card after using it for ""bigger"" purchases. (This number is from a student loan document I received a few weeks ago.) 

Basically, what I'm asking for is advice - what can I do NOW to adequately prepare/buffer myself from my student debt repayments?",finance,1401458984
personalfinance,Turning a bad situation into a great one: next steps,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

Posting from a throwaway today because of the boatload of personal information I'm about to share. **I'm here today mostly to discuss with you how to keep my momentum going.**

Here's my backstory: Went to a private liberal arts university in ohio for computer science. I'm not the greatest at coding, and it certainly hurt my chances of having a better college experience, but it was worth it. Mostly. A *week* before I was supposed to graduate, I turned in a *rough draft* of the last paper I ever would had to write paper on combinatorial auction algorithms to a professor. Being careless and focusing on crossing the stage, and honestly not thinking it was possible to get in trouble for a rough draft, my professor sends me the the academic standards board for having unquoted text from one of my research sources (in my defense, I still cited the source and would have absolutely properly acknowledged the author in my final draft!). The board expels me and I'm told I have 8 hours to pack up my things and never come back. Flash forward two weeks. I appealed and pleaded and thankfully my sentence was lowered to a year long suspension. 111 credits to my name, 127 to graduate from there, and so long as the CS department OK's it, I can take an equivalent course at another institution and then transfer to credits back (at the end of the suspension). The other credits I can fulfill with GEs.

I use the injustice and anger I felt about this to channel my efforts and absolutely go ham on the job search, which I had been neglecting throughout the year because, well, I'm a millennial and that's what my stereotype says I should do. I get an interview less than a week after I was kicked out. By the time my peers were strolling across the stage with their sheepskins, I was strolling into a new job making 42,000 before tax. Life's funny like that. It's not about what happens to us, it's about how we respond. Even a month later, it's constantly in my mind how sad and depressed I feel if I look backwards, and how hopeful and happy I feel when I look forwards. So, I've got to keep looking forwards. Chin up now.  

So, here's the breakdown of my situation. Critique away internet strangers and friends.  

* 22 years old
* Male  
* No physical defects. Only medical problem is that I was diagnosed this year with type 2 diabetes (quite a year thus far . . . note bene: I'm not overweight nor do I have a poor diet. I believe that I'm actually suffering from adult onset diabetes, which really isn't better . . . This diabetes thing is very new to me)  
* Allowed to stay on parent's health insurance (aetna) until 26. Have to pay copays obviously. 
* My dad just transferred the title of his 99' Honda Accord (194,000m) to me for $1. Last weekend I had ""the works"" done for $1500. 
* I was gifted a Macbook Pro nearly 2 years ago. I mostly use it for personal use, but I have also done some programming on it.
* 29k in student debt. I could give you the exact breakdown of the loans, but essentially the biggest is 16000 @ 6.5%, which is currently in grace until November. The other two are about half the rate. I was lucky considering I went to private university. I plan to put away 1000 / mth, and once the grace period expires, put all funds towards the highest interest loan. Sort of a modified snowball approach. 
* Columbus, Ohio.
* $1000 in checking, $300 in Chase savings acct, $16 in credit card debt.
* Parents letting me use their CostCo membership indefinitely. 
* I'm on a waitlist for an apartment complex. I can expect to pay ~710 a month, which a bit over my initial budget, but I could really find anything in Columbus sub 600 that I would be feel safe and not have to worry about my car getting broken into. This place is gated, and the apartment comes with an alarm. Until then, I am subleasing from a student who's lease expires July 31 for 200 /mth, and he's covering utilities. The apartment I'm waiting for has told me that it's likely I'll be able to move in sometime August, so I'll just have to airbnb for a little bit. 
* Parents letting me stay on cell phone bill for time being. I've expressed that I will switch to my own plan once I am a bit more stable. I'm currently budgeting for buying a phone from Repubic Wireless, and then going with their 25/mth plan. 

Those are the big things. My income and budget are loosely as follows. Bear in mind I haven't been out on my own for a full month.

I just received my paycheck for my first (partial) two weeks. My workplace sends out paychecks on the 30th of each month. 1592.5 - 254.25 = 1338.25, which means that 16% went to uncle sam. 

Reasonably, I think I'm going to end up taking home ~2600 a month, but I'm still very unsure about all of these tax deductions and how they work (again, I make 42000 in columbus, ohio as a single filling status, no dependents. 2 federal exemptions, 1 ohio). Here's my YNAB list: (Note: This is mostly theoretical. The way I like to do budgeting is to budget BEFORE I develop spending habits, and use metrics to curve and discrepancies between budget and actual.)

**Variable Weekly Expenses (calculated in terms of aggregate monthly)** (Checking)

* Groceries: 150
* Fuel: 125 
* Personal care / hygiene : 25
* Household Goods: 10

**Discretionary Expenses** (Checking)

* Restaurants: 100 
* Clothing: 40
* Spending money: 50
* Apps and Games: 5

**Mandatory Monthly Expenses** (Checking)
 
* Rent: 710 (water/sewage/garbage included)
* Phone: 25 (When I switch to republic wireless)
* Electric / Gas: 90 (Will obviously fluctuate) 
* Internet: 35 (TWC)

**Mandatory Yearly Expenses** (Savings)

* Car repairs: 100
* Car Insurance 75
* Website: 4

**Emergency fund** (Savings)

* Emergency fund: 250

**Rainy Day Funds** (Savings)

* Life Insurance: 5 (not really sure about this. Company life insurance plan = no pay?)

**Debt** (Savings)

* Student Loan Repayment: 1000

**Investments** (Investment Portfolio)

* 401(k): 0 (My company doesn't begin to match until 1 year after starting. Should I contribute anyways?)
* Roth IRA: 450 
* Index Funds: 0 (Still looking into this)

**Savings Targets** (Savings)

* Vacation: 10
* New Computer: 80
* New Phone: 25
* New Office Chair: 25
* New Desk: 25
* New Bed: 25
* New Knife: 5
* New Dashcam: 10
* Non-Holiday gifts: 20
* Birthdays: 20
* Christmas: 5

**Buffer** (Savings)

* Buffer: 100

Which equals 3575. Again, this is theoretical. I'm currently spending 1/3 of that per month. Obviously there are some big chucks of that which will change because I might only have about 2700 a month to work with. Any suggestions about what to add or remove or change are greatly appreciated. Again, I want to keep my good vibes rolling, and part of that to me is having a sound financial portfolio in my back pocket so I can worry about the more important things in life.  If asked about my 5 year goal, I want to pay down all my debt, get my bachelors, and be making at least 60k by the time I'm 24. By 25 I want to move to California.

personalfinance,Consolidating Private and Federal Loans from multiple loan servicing companies,"Hello PF,

personalfinance,[IL] 23 years old and new to the real world. I want to open a savings account but all the interest rates I'm seeing make it seem pretty pointless.,"Hey all.

23 years old, started my first real job about a year ago. ~$50k/yr, ~$35k take home by my calculations. Right now I have about $14k in two TCF checking accounts and a few credit cards I pay off fully every month.

I have a 401k set up through my work, but I'd like to get a savings account as well. Why? I don't know, isn't that what adults do? So I've checked out my current bank's (TCF Bank) [savings accounts](https://www.tcfbank.com/resources/images/2736.pdf) and from what I can tell I'd be getting about 0.03-0.05% interest on the amount of money I have. That's fucking gross. Am I reading this wrong?

I've checked out a few other banks and didn't see much better. I've seen a lot on Roth IRA's on here and — though I admittedly barely know what they are — don't think that's what I'm looking for. I'd rather a savings account where I have access to the money if necessary.

Is there some secret bank with decent rates I'm missing? Am I reading something wrong? At this point it just seems useless to open a savings account if I'm only getting $7 a year in interest...",finance,1401463389

My Mom is terminally ill and her life expectancy is unknown. She was diagnosed two years ago, and has responded to treatment fairly well ever since.

They have about $150,000 in checking and savings and that's it. No retirement savings or investment accounts.

My parents' take home is about $165,000. Realistically, I think they only have a few years left at this income level and then there will be a small life insurance payout of about $100,000 and my Dad's take home will be around $70,000 a year.


Credit Card Debt: None

Car Payments: None (They own two cars, 2009 and 2014 models.)

I hope to get a job around $110k salary starting next summer but will obviously not have any income after August. I've worked for about 7.5 years to save up to pay for my education. I've also been in school for 2.5 years, which has been tough to juggle with work but I'm 2/3rd of the way done and I'd like to have some fun by being just a full-time student for 2 semesters.

Assets:

Liquid Savings: $70k (cleared out my play brokerage account in anticipation of this)

401k+IRA+Roth IRA: $230k (I've been maxing out my 401k and IRAs every year)

Liabilities:

Student Loan 1: $32k (@ 4.5% floating interest through a private lender)

Student Loan 2: $9k (@ 6.8% interest - this loan is subsidized and federal)


I have about $40k of tuition left (out of $110k total) to complete my program. I am thinking about using Unsubsidized Federal loans ($21k) to finance part of the rest of my tuition. The interest rate is 5.41% with a 3% origination fee and will not be subsidized.


Any thoughts on if I should take out loans or pay out in cash? I have that option but it would be a big drain on finances.


Also, I plan to pay off my loans very aggressively when I start my future job next year. I have no plans to buy a house in the near future and my car is a 2011 Honda (hope to get 7-8 years out of it).

personalfinance,Lets discuss strategy for managing a Federal Student Loan and defaulted Private Student Loan in collections,"I have the following student loans(all approximate):
150,000 Federal Consolidated @ 4.5%, 550/m on graduated plan, payout in 2040.
40,000 defaulted private in collections @ 0%, they are not charging interest but review my account annually and are under no obligations to accept payments, currently set at 350/m. They have been reporting me as 'in collections' on my credit report for three years under this arrangement. I have never missed an installment, but have never paid an annual lump sum either.

Our house and cars are in my wifes name, we have couple of young kids. She does better than me but Im catching up slowly. We're in early 40s.

Im not entirely sure if our income level is relevant, what I'd like to talk about is, as between the defaulted private and the federal, how should I choose to apply any extra income toward paying them down?

If our major assets rely on my wifes credit then it seems to reason that I should pay down the interest bearing accounts and do whatever it takes to keep the private creditor happy. Of course my relationship with that creditor is what it is, there is tension every year at the account review.

Also, if I have demonstrated extra capacity to the private collector, they will press me till it really hurts. Its bad enough as is. Im taking a new position and I think I will have 200$ extra per month, probably, so long as I can really divert that from a casual lifestyle bump that my wife will maybe be looking for and of course a increased std of living for my kids.

Bitcoin,A word of caution on using Changetip or any other tipping bot,"Please remember not to keep large amounts of bitcoins on these bots. They can disappear at any time with whatever is deposited.

For example, changetip has it expressly written in their TOS that they can change the TOS at any time, and you cannot use any of their services (including the ability to withdraw your bitcoins) unless you accept the new terms [1].  In case you ever want to sue to get your money back, the terms force you to use an arbitrator in California as well as waive your rights to a trial or class action lawsuit [2].

Changetip will probably eventually sell to another business. They are primed to do so. When that happens, users will be forced to accept whatever new TOS the new owners mandate or the users will need to abandon their bitcoins with the option travel to California pay an arbitrator and hope to win the coins back.

Again, this isn't just changetip, please, **weigh the risks before trusting any company with any amount that you mind losing.**

Personally, I don't even like the idea of forcing another user to accept a third party TOS to get a tip.  If I write a check for $5, the recipient doesn't need to open an account at my bank to deposit it.

personalfinance,Help with financial decision for son...,"Soooo, this may be a rather obvious question, but I shall ask anyway.

I'm the father of a college-age son in the U.S. He is currently going to a state school, and was lucky enough to receive some scholarship money. But of course, on top of that, he is also getting some financial aid in federal (Stafford) loans. That covered most, but not all, of his bill, so we had to take out a personal loan in his name (Sallie Mae) to cover the rest. This pattern is likely to continue for his four years, so he will come out of college with a decent chunk of student debt, some in the form of lower-rate Federal loans, and some in the form of higher-rate personal loans.

Unfortunately, I'm not in a position, financially, to pay this stuff off, at least not now. (To do so, I would have to take out my OWN loan, and likely at a higher rate than what he got.)

In the mean time, he is gainfully employed during the summer, and has made a commitment to save half of his money. (Unasked by me, btw, which I thought was responsible of him.) 

He was looking into putting the money into a savings account. However, it's hard to find a savings account that even pays 1% interest right now, and even lower risk longer-term investments like CDs aren't much higher. Meanwhile, the Sallie Mae loans are accruing interest at a rate somewhere around 6%, although he doesn't actually have to pay on them until he graduates.

So, it seems to me that the smartest financial choice for him would be to put any spare cash he can manage towards paying down the highest interest rate loan first, rather than putting it into savings.

However, I'm not super financially-savvy, so I'm not sure if I'm missing something here.

Bitcoin,Short rant on UK and Bitcoin protocol,"When I was in Sweden I used to send money to Kraken in under 24 hours, via SEPA, without any fees whatsoever.

Then I moved to the UK. Big mistake.

Wanna transfer money outside the UK? 15 pounds please.
SEPA? What is that? Doesn't matter, we'll charge you for it anyway, and then double that charge via our own exchange rate.

Meet TransferWise: http://i.imgur.com/gkMBfIW.png

Most banks do the same. You never know which one is going to decide next to just block an account.

The UK banking system is ridiculous, old, and monopolistic. UK citizens don't realize just how bad they have it. 300 pounds max ATM withdrawal? Really?

In any case, any other so called exchange or service that deals with the UK will charge you insane fees.

So now I have to use TransferWise to send money to my Swedish account and do a free SEPA transfer with that one, towards Kraken.

I save 15 pounds every time, but the whole thing take 3-4 days. Unbelievable.

What pisses me off the most is that UK natives are so proud of their country that they actually defend this system as being one of the best!

""But we have free national transfers!"" is a favourite of theirs or ""Just use another bank"" or ""It's for safety measures."" or even better ""UK doesn't have the Euro, that's why"".

Really?!

Sweden has free national transfers. Still does free SEPA. No, it doesn't have the Euro either, and I'm pretty sure safety is as important there as it is in the UK.

There is no other bank to use, except getting tangled in Euro accounts with ridiculous demands (earn at least 50,000 pounds per year, have this in your account at all times, make at least 2 direct debit payments, swim the Thames twice every month, etc.).

This is the number one reason I'll be leaving the UK. Because it's actually cheaper for me to continue using my Swedish bank account and Swedish credit card, inside the UK, for the bank account has no fees for transfers or anything other, and the credit card is actually with a decent limit (20% of yearly wage) as opposed to the ludicrous amount the UK banks offered me.

""We want to offer you a credit card with a 1000 pound limit and with a 34% interest rate."" - Fucking keep it.

People - 10-15 pounds for a transfer inside the EU is NOT normal.

More Details In Text","First, I want to thank the /r/BitcoinMining, /r/LitecoinMining, /r/scryptmining, and any of the other mining reddits that I participated or lurked in!  If it wasn't for all of the the information I gathered here, I wouldn't have been able to make my numbers and formulas to make all of this happen!  I figured it would be safe to post this in /r/Bitcoin.. since so many folks *may* still have this in their feed with other cryptos... and I really didn't want to do a lot of ""x/post from ... "" in other reddits.  =)

Several months ago, I left my job to spend more time with my family, since my mining hardware was making more than my salary, and my office was a 2-hour commute (one way) from home.  

It.  Was.  AWESOME!!!

I was taking the kids to school and picking them up, again!  I finally got to spend some lunches with my wife! DISC GOLF!!  Now, I've never been one to ""rest on my laurels"" for too long.  I was really getting bored around the house after a week or two.  There's only so much disc-golf to play when all of your friends are 9-5ers.  I knew I wanted to do something more with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency... but I was trying to figure out what would be a ""good idea"".  I had a few plans... website to sell/eBay GPU rigs... B2B service to encourage crypto use at local businesses... but nothing really ""jumped"", or got me *really* excited.

Another friend of mine was just opening an upscale vapor (e-cig) shop, [Vape South](http://www.vapesouth.net/home/).  I've known him and his significant other for 8-9 years, and had worked a retail store with him, before... so I thought ""Why not?"".  I love working with customers, face-to-face... sales, retail, marketing... it would be fun!
And, it has been!  T and K have been great, and it's been a blast helping them get their own business and dreams off the ground and running!  It's always awesome to see people's efforts and honesty do a big ""karma blast"", and reward them with a profitable business and great clientèle.  It's neat to see everyone who's interested in vaping, and talk to them about ""how they got interested in it"", help them find better hardware, and spreading info about healthier smoking alternatives... see people *drop smoking all together* (hint, hint) ... *and that's when it hit me*...

**THIS IS WHAT CRYPTO-CURRENCY NEEDS**

So, I started piecing together this concept of [MeetSpace Crypto](http://www.meetspacecrypto.com).

I want to provide a cookie-cutter, franchise-model retail opportunity for folks who are excited about crypto-currencies, and want to maintain a local venue for reddit/Bitcoin/(insert Alt-Coin)/mining/trading meetups (think a Starbucks-meets-B&amp;N-comfy-meeting-space), while selling the mining equipment that is run in-house.

Look... [CoinDesk just published an article about 'The Five Biggest Threats Facing Bitcoin'](http://www.coindesk.com/five-biggest-threats-facing-bitcoin/).  I honestly think that [MeetSpace Crypto](http://www.meetspacecrypto.com) could help with a lot of this!

* The centralization of bitcoin

If we can put mining hardware in more peoples hands, and promote p2pool mining of ALL crypto-currencies, it will benefit cryptos all around.

* Bad actors

THIS!  We need happy, smiling ""Crypto Faces"" out there!  In meat-space!!  I want DOGE-heads in their NASCAR stuff, and folks that have several ""I Love Bitcoin"" shirts in their closets **working at these stores**... who ARE excited about crypto-currencies already, earning a paycheck to be excited about cryptos!

All of that could really help with -

* Low Adoption

Local business owners could also have a chance to come by and see how easy some of these systems (Coinbase, BitPay, CoinKite) are to use and integrate.

Also..

I've already had 4 people *want to buy BTC from me*, in person, in the past 2 weeks... 3 on LocalBitcoins.com, and 1 with Mycelium's new ""Buy/Sell"" feature.  One guy drove from Mississippi (2 &amp; 1/2 hours), to buy 1.5 BTC from me!  It would be really awesome to provide a ""safe area"" to meet if this gets bigger, this summer.

[The Fed actually said that Crypto-currencies could ""be a boon"" for the economy](http://www.coinbuzz.com/2014/05/21/federal-reserve-bitcoin-could-serve-as-a-boon/), recently.  I think this could be a chance to prove them right on a positive note, and provide some jobs and opportunities for crypto-enthusiasts!

I've already thrown my own money into the name and lawyers and all that stuff to get started.  I'm going to have a Bitcoinstarter and Kickstarter event in a few weeks.  If you're interested in helping spread some crypto to ""Main Street"", let me know!

personalfinance,Refinancing Parent PLUS Loans with SoFi,"So my parents took a Parent PLUS loan (totaling around 90K) out for me to pay for college, I just graduated and the payments will be kicking in soon and I'll be paying it off. I'm looking into SoFi to refinance so I can lower the interest rate. It's sitting at around 9% and it looks like I can get around 5/6% from SoFi.

Since the loan is in my dads name will that affect anything in terms of me getting the loan? How much will this loan affect my credit score after it goes into my name?

Also, does anyone have any experience with consolidating in federal loans? (I've got 8 different loans totaling around 25K with rates between 3.4 and 6.8) This usually gets a big NO from this subreddit, but I will have a stable 6 figure salary. So I'm not too worried about IBR or the other benefits of federal loans.

Anyone see any reasons to not go with SoFi? Or any other suggestions for paying off my student loans?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietinbank#Alleged_frauds

I couldn't find any better source in English to i will summarize the story. 

The bank name is Vietinbank (VTB) . In 2007 they mobilise a large sum of money from other banks, organisations and individuals for investment in real property with promise for high interest rate (above 14%). In 2012-2013 the bubble explode, real estate price went down 50%. Bad investments, bad debts piled up.  

And here is the twist. VTB declared that the employee named ""Huyen Nhu"" who receive/process the deposit went rogue. She forged documents and stole all the money (200 million USD).  Banks, organisations and individuals affected by this claim that they did business with VTB inside VTB office, they have document proof that the money was inside Vietinbank system. However VTB claim that all documents and signatures are fake, VTB never receive those money. Which means the victims is gullible for giving the money to the wrong person which is quite comical considering one of the victims is ACB - one of the 10 largest bank in Vietnam. Now it is a fraud case between banks and organisation versus Huyen Nhu and VTB have no liability. 

The judge indicted Huyen Nhu swindled all the money by herself, Vietinbank have no responsibility in this case. 

One single banker faked all documents, signatures while scamming people and then 200 million USD debt which was under Vietinbank name suddenly go puff. 


For US version, just imagine you go to Bank of American to deposit your saving. The teller processes your deposit then gives you documents signed by the head of branch office confirming your deposit . Later, BoA inform you that all those documents are fake, your money was stolen by that teller and BoA have nothing to do with your money which is unlikely to be recovered since that teller is too poor able to pay back.",cryptocurrency,1401498618

personalfinance,Looking for some input on my 5 year financial plan,"I have been out of college for a few years and have a good job. My debt at the time was very saturated (School loans, various credit lines, car payment, personal debt to family for helping with school, credit card, etc)

At the peak, I was around $101k in debt -- without a mortgage (I have a LOT in school loans!)

I currently make roughly $71k/yr and over the past 3.5 years I've worked on paying off the various debt I have. I had so many different lines of debt that I could really only afford to pay the min payment on them before I ended up paying off 1, and then shoving that to the other.

3.5 years later I am just down to my 2 student loans. Car, Credit Lines, family debt, and credit cards are all paid off and I never accumulate a balance on my credit card that I can't pay off in full each month.

My student loads are very high interest sadly -- even though they were government based loans. My personal government loans are:

Consolidated Subsidized Loan - 5.75% interest - $18,242 Balance

Consolidated Unsubsized Loan - 5.75% interest - $12,545 Balance

My mother also took out Parent Plus Loans for me. I am not a cosigner on these, but I pay them as if they were my own on her account. They stand like this:

5 Different loans (unconsolidated) ranging from $2,842 to $14,629 - all at a whopping 8.5% interest rate.

I will explain more about this loan below when I explain my current plan I am looking to have evaluated by you fine Redditors!

Up until now I've only ever paid minimum payments on these loans. I have them on the 25 year payment plan. But, since I have domino'd my other lines of debt, I can now really start working on these bad boys (will have roughly $800 a month extra above the minimum to pay on them)

Now before I get into paying these guys off, let me tell you my other goals. I have maybe $1350 in my savings account. I have maybe been saving $100-$150 a month as sort of my “emergency” fund. I know this isnt’ much of an emergency fund… but I am at the opportunity to throw this extra $800 a month from lack of my other debt areas to really build this up to $10k to $12k and have a nice safety net. 

Also, within the next 5 years, part of me would like to own a home or condo unless that’s really not a wise choice with all this other debt.

Now onto the plan…

The current plan I have is to wait until July and see if the parent plus loan interest rates (currently at 6.41% if I were to consolidate) drop more like they have the past year. If the interest rate were to fall into the 5% range, then I’d consolidate those loans to reduce the interest on them. And to be morbid for a second (this was her idea not mine) – if she were to pass away before I paid them off, then those loans would disappear since I am not a co-signer on them. This is obviously not something I am planning on (how bad would that be!) but she is getting older and typically our family doesn’t live to be very, very old. However it’s still in my long term plan to pay off assuming she lives forever and ever (I hope at least!)

I’d like to get that savings account up for my safety net. My goal would be $10k-12k which would be basically 3-4 months of lag my current pay rate. I am a software developer with experience, so I don’t think it’s too difficult to find a job, especially living in Dallas-Fort Worth.

I also want to someday start looking at saving up to buy a home or a condo in a few years, but I am not sure if I should continue to live the apartment life and really go after those student loans. So here is my current plan…

Step 1: Get savings account to $12k
Step 2: Pay off my personal loans (currently $30.7k) to about half of what they are as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of interest.

Step 3: Split the extra income I have at the time between continuing paying off personal loan, plus saving for a house down payment

Step 4: After the house is in order, put all additional income toward the personal loans to wipe out whatever is left.

Step 5: All this time I would still be paying the minimum payment on the Parent Plus Loans, but then this would be my next goal.

This all assumes I don’t need to buy a new car or anything anytime soon, but hopefully I will be making more 5-7 years from now.  My car is a 2010 model, so I hopefully won’t need one for a while.

Is this a wise plan? Should I change my numbers and goals anywhere? I consider myself fairly smart with my money goals, but want some people with experience to vet my ideas.

personalfinance,Sallie Mae 15k Accrued Interest; Grace period ends in 6 Mos; Help?,"Hey Guys!

I've been lurking around this sub for a bit since the changes on reddit; I'm glad to have found such a helpful resource and I would love to hear your thoughts:

I now realize that taking out all these loans in my early college years was not a smart choice, but I am trying to best tackle the situation I am in.

**My title covers the gist: I just graduated and I have a grace period of 6 months... One of my Sallie Mae Private Loans has a 15k accrued interest, which I believe will be added to the principal of 35k once that grace period ends.**

**Background:**
Due to residency issues (being an Alien when I first started college in 2008), I funded my first 2.5 years in college through Sallie Mae, the only available option at the time (ineligible for federal loans).

**To break it down,** *I have two different types of loans with Sallie Mae, a Signature Student 8.25% interest rate disbursed in 2008 (#1) and Smart Option 9-12.75% interest rate disbursed 2009-2010 (#2), which had different payment plans based on the year I signed up.*

With the Signature Student loan, I did not have to make any payments while in school. Stupidly, I let it be. (I mean, who understood that stuff their first year out in the wild, man?)

With the Smart Option Loan, I set it up to pay interest while in school. I have been very good with these payments thus far (about almost $500 a month interest), though admittedly, not much have gone to principal.

As the years passed, I understood more the situation I am in. I stopped taking out Sallie Mae Loans for the 2010 school year; worked for a while to fund my education, until I was eligible for federal financial aid once I received permanent residency.

Imagine my panic once I realized that the First loan I took out and have not been making payments in now has a $15k accrued interest.


**What can be done? There is no way I can pay the full amount before it is added to my principal at the end of the 6 month grace period. Am I doomed to accept this added amount to the total?**


Is there any other advice for me? I am trying to learn as much as I can.",finance,1401510391

I've just received my first secured credit card Wells Fargo, with a limit of $300. I put quite a lot on it to start, but then I heard that I should aim for under 20% utilization, so I paid it back down to $60 straight away.

I've signed up to creditkarma.com, not sure if they're a good site or not, but my credit score is being reported as 734, which seems way to high for someone with zero credit history.

They are also suggesting that I apply for a ""Discover it"" credit card, so that I have at least 2 credit accounts. Is this a good idea, and is that a good card? I've read that having at least 2 cards can improve my credit score. And then I'll be all set if I utilize them both at &lt;20% and pay them off in full every month, and keep it up for a few years.

[It looks like a pretty good offer.](http://www.beverlyharzog.com/discover-it-secured-credit-card-review/). I like the fact that it has no annual fees, I can earn rewards, I can see my FICO score on the statement every month, it's not reported as a secured card, and I can get my deposit back and turn it into an unsecured card after 12 months.

I've never made a late payment and have always paid more than the minimum. I don't pay it off every month because I was under the (apparently false) impression that it was good to hold a balance on it. I will be paying them off every month from now on if I can though.  
  
As you can probably imagine, all the other credit card companies want my debt. I was getting at least 3 offers a month for a while. I would always look at them, check out the interest rate, the annual fee, and the benefits, and if they weren't any better than the ones I have, I just toss them.  
  
But I did recently get one that looks really really good. So my questions is, is it good to have multiple credit lines open? CreditKarma tells me that it looks good if you have more lines open, so I'm tempted, but I wanted to ask someone smarter in finances than me first.  
  
I will say that I'm not the kind of person to spend money I don't have. I've learned a lot about what not to do from my parents. I wouldn't be flaunting/swiping it when I don't have the money coming in to pay it off. I would get it for the benefits.

John Kerry says that Edward Snowden should ""man up"" and return to the US to ""face the music"". 

The music in this case being a show trial under the auspices of a kangaroo court, where the judge, jury and executioner are the US government and evidence and pleas for the defense are not even allowed to be entered into the record.  

Edward Snowden committed no crime against the American people. 

In fact he provided a great service to the American people, by letting them know that the NSA is collecting every form of electronic communication on every American and hundreds of millions more around the world. 

(Anybody that was remotely awake already knew this before Snowden. Snowden did not actually reveal anything that was materially new, except for the names of the programs and some further details of how the mass spying is carried out.)

 

Edward Snowden only committed a ""crime"" against the Federal government. 

He caused major embarrassment to the government because he revealed some of the crimes, against the American people, being carried out by the Federal government. 

There is no doubt whatsoever that spying on every form of electronic communication by every American is a crime against the American people of the first order. (see 1 to 4.)

 

Mass spying is a massive crime, because :

 

It stifles debate and protest (people are more careful to not catch the eye of the authorities - as in East Germany under communism and the Stasi)

It stifles critical reporting of the government's policies, activities and scandals - see James Rosen harassment. 

It allows blackmail of senior public and private figures, including politicians, judges, newspaper editors, lawyers etc.

It undermines the very foundations of democracy, which cannot exist without robust public debate and open and safe criticism of the government, when people think the government is wrong.

Holding elections without the means for public debate is the system that Saddam Hussein ran in Iraq and the communists ran in the USSR. 

Meanwhile John Kerry has committed very serious crimes against the American people himself. 

John Kerry should ""man up"" and ""face the music"" for his undoubted crimes and resign. 

John Kerry's crimes of fraud and deceit against the American people :

Outright blatantly lied when he said that there was firm evidence that it was Assad's forces that were behind the chemical weapons attack in Damascus in August 2013. 

No such evidence ever existed. (see ref 5 to 7)

The United Nations weapons inspection team now absolutely confirm and the CIA intelligence reports at the time suggested, that the chemical weapons were fired from ""rebel"" held territory as a false flag attack to get America to overtly go to war in Syria, starting with a massive bombing campaign. 

Obama had previously broadcast that it would be in the interests of the Islamic Extremist terrorists, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey etc. to engineer a chemical weapons attack, because that would cross an Obama ""red-line"" which he would go to war against Syria over. 

Thankfully there were enough people with enough common sense to see through all the Syrian lies and Obama called off his overt war when it was obvious he was about to lose the vote on it in Congress. 

 

Further evidence has now come to light that the chemical weapons attack was a Turkish plot in alliance with Syrian terrorists, to get America to go to war in Syria.

John Kerry is no better than Bush/Cheney in trying to start a war based on nothing but lies for Corporate profit. 

John Kerry is also telling massive lies to the American people about Ukraine and Russia. See 8.

The recent Coup in Kiev was engineered by Victoria Nuland, the State Department and the CIA, assisted by John McCain. 

It was a deliberate provocation by the US to start a conflict with Russia. 

America is the warmonger and the aggressor against Russia.

This is partly to do with Zbigniew Brzezinski's plan, published in 1997, to incorporate Ukraine into NATO, but it has at least as much to do with boosting the profits of US multinationals (just like Iraq and Syria). 

In the case of Ukraine and conflict with Russia it is intended to boost the profits of Monsanto, Exxon, Chevron, Cargill, arms manufacturers etc.

More war and conflict has always been the best way to get governments to buy more weapons. 

Getting governments into debt has always been the mechanism by which elite bankers have gained control of governments and countries throughout history, by lending them the money to go to war.

John Kerry continues to cover up the reasons why Benghazi happened. See 9.

The attack in Benghazi happened because of a CIA black ops to smuggle weaponry from Gaddafi's weapons hoard from Libya to Syrian terrorists via Turkey. 

The black ops went wrong because one group of Libyan Islamic Extremist terrorists got jealous of another Libyan extremist group that was making more money out of the CIA.

John Kerry's previous crimes have included :

Voting for the invasion of Iraq - which was obviously and blatantly a complete pack of lies to anyone with any common sense. See 10

Helping to cover up the real circumstances around the attack on September 11th 2001. See 11

Justice would best be served by John Kerry ""manning up"" and volunteering to submit himself to a war crimes tribunal. 

The absolute minimum that John Kerry should do, is immediately resign due to his terrible crimes of fraud and deceit against the American people.

We received a letter dated April 29th stating our loan had be transferred to another lender. 

I contacted this lender with our new loan number to set up an automatic withdrawal for our mortgage payment but was sent through an automative system that told me (after entering in our loan number) that our loan had been sold. 

I called back again, pressing 0 and # many times, in order to get to a real person. The loan agency told me that they had sold my loan to a new agency on May 7th (8 days after sending me the letter saying they had my loan).  They told me a different agency had my loan and gave me their phone number. We had not received any communication from this new agency and had not received a billing statement.

I called the new agency and was put through again an automative system but it did not recognize my information. I pressed 0 and # more times to get to a Customer Service rep. The rep told me my property was not in their system and they did not have my loan.  

I called back the agency that sent the letter in April saying they had my loan, and told them that the agency that they said had my loan, told me that they did not have our information in their system.  I was put on a three way call with both agencies but the one that was supposed to have my loan said (even after going to a supervisor) told me that they did not have our loan and to contact our initial lending agency. 

I called our initial lending agency and told them about the situation and they said they would look into who currently held our loan but still have not heard back from them. 

I am not sure what to do at this point. I don't know who to make my mortgage payment (and it is going to be due very soon as it is the beginning of the month) to and I don't want to be foreclosed on because I don't know who to give my money too.  

We also did have a lot of issues with the initial lending company during the closing process and they would not call back the listing agent for her questions prior to closing. And then, they didn't really give us information on where are mortgage payments would go once they were due. Then the apparently sold our loan to an organization that sold it off quickly. 

How do I document this and cover us so that we don't fall prey to slimy banks that foreclose without any documentation? Is there a way federally to find out who is currently holding my loan? 

Any advice would be much appreciated!

Edit: So After calling Agency #3 again, they now say they have my loan and the bought it June 1st (which was a Sunday) They said I should be receiving information in the mail, and gave me an address to send the check to.  I also heard back from Agency #1 and they gave me the same agency but a different address to send my check to.  I also think that the sell may have finalized on June 1st, but it was done prior to that and Agency #3 did not follow the federal regulations of notifing us in 15 days.",finance,1401555868
personalfinance,Income Based Repayment Failure to Report Income,"Hi. I am someone who is on income-based repayment on federal student loans, and has been out of work for about a year. Recently I got hired for an extremely temporary gig (2 weeks), that has turned into a still temporary, but longer term project of over 3 months now.

When the gig was two weeks, I wasn't too interested in having them do the whole process of changing my payment and then changing it back, but now I clearly owe my loan provider some money, but I am afraid that this may ruin my chances of qualifying for IBR.

While I am not looking for legal advice on what to do, I am curious if anyone knows what will happen if I simply say, ""my bad, I want to pay what I owe."" Will they make me ineligible for IBR in the future (which I will surely need after this temp job goes away).

If so, is there any way to claim I just got the job now, and pay for the number of months that the job ultimately lasts, to sqaure things up, or will my income statements (independent contractor, paid from standard operating account) bear out this adjustment of the truth?

I want to pay what I owe, and it is completely my fault for forgetting about this and being negligent, but if I am ineligible for IBR in the future I will have no means of paying off my substantial student loans, and will surely be on the street. I have seriously fucked up, and I want to make it right. :(

Anyone have any thoughts/advice/etc. (I know no one here is a lawyer/my lawyer/etc., just looking for general info/tips on this sort of situation).

Thanks!",finance,1401557469
personalfinance,Opportunity to rent to own.,"I've come across a somewhat unique opportunity. I'm 26 years old, and have some friends that are moving to another state that have offered that I rent to own their house. The house was built in 2011 so it's pretty new. Their offer is that I don't have to make any down payment, but I do have to make a $900 non-refundable security deposit. Then, I would have to pay $900 a month. ~680 of that will go to the mortgage, and the rest they would keep for themselves. The house is selling for 140,000, so I'd be getting into about a 30 year payoff. They will keep on paying the property taxes and all that, all I would have to pay is the $900 monthly. Their mortgage is currently financed with a 4% interest rate, so we all figured to just keep financing it as is. My friends and myself are both pretty new to all of this, so I'm just looking for some general advice. I never thought that renting to own was a great idea, but this seems like a pretty good opportunity. I'm pretty financially stable right now, and will have all of my credit debt paid off by September. I then plan on double paying on my car payment, so I'll pay off my car early and be down with that by Sept. 2015. Then I'll be able to start saving a bunch of money. I'm wondering if, in the future, I could make a big down payment and refinance the loan for me so that I could just end up making my own mortgage payments and no longer be ""renting to own"" but just owning and paying off the mortgage. They gave me a blank contract to look over, and said that I could add whatever I wanted to it. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1401561497
personalfinance,What's better? Paying down current mortgage or saving the extra money for our next down payment?,"I'm pretty sure this is the right place to ask since it involves savings not just real estate. 

Anyway, my husband and I have a 30 year mortgage on our townhouse at 5.25%, the pay off amount is 33k. We couldn't originally get a lower interest rate because the initial loan was under 50k and it's a townhouse. Market value on the townhouse is around $120k. 

We are planning on having a family at some point in time and would need to upgrade to a bigger house and don't plan on paying PMI, so our target is to save up around 60k for a 300k house in around 4-5 years. 

We are able to save up around 10k per year at this point on top of our 401k and mutual fund contributions. 

So long story short, is it better to put the ~$800 a month savings towards the mortgage and get more potential principal out of the house when we eventually sell it or is it better to just put that into savings?

One side note is that if we are able to save up the down payment we plan on keeping the town house because the rental income would be great in this area, so we'd get around $800 a month in our pockets every month after mortgage and HOA are factored in.",finance,1401562649

personalfinance,"Enough to pay for school with savings, should I take out a loan anyway?","I'm going to be attending graduate school, cost of tuition is $21,000 for the 36 credit degree. I've never taken out a loan, financed anything... paid cash for everything. Credit score is 720. My question is if it is worth it to take the loan to build some sort of loan history? I have investments (mutual funds) which are currently hovering around 6%, but you never know if it will be up or down in two years once I finish. Should I take the loan and throw it into investments and hope to break even after two years, or just not worry about it and pay out of pocket for the whole bit?

Loan is an unsub loan $21000 at 5.41% interest rate. I think there are some fees and such in there as well. Interest starts as soon as you take out the loan. https://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#interest-rates

personalfinance,Torn on what to payoff: car or student loan,"First off, let me know if more details are needed to provide advice; I'm providing what I believe is sufficient.

1. I have an emergency fund; this decision does not impact it
2. I contribute to my 401k to obtain the max match
3. I have no credit card debt; only debts are mortgage, 1 car, and student loans
4. Husband and I are a 1 income household while he finishes undergrad
5. I am an MBA student

That being said, I have extra cash (work bonus) that I'd like to use to lower my existing debts.  I keep going back and forth on whether it is better to pay off my car loan or my first year of MBA school student loan.

Car Loan: $11,800 remaining at 2.9% interest (worth $20K); payment is $561/month
MBA Student Loan: $6,379 at 5.41% interest; in deferment as I'm still in school, but is unsubsidized and accruing interest.  I do have others from my undergrad (4.75%, subsidized and deferred) that I can attack as well, but this one is my primary concern.

As the MBA student loan is the highest interest rate and unsubsidized, I think it would be good to wipe it to minimize interest impact.  If I choose not to pay off this loan right now, I do plan to pay the accrued interest to avoid it compounding.

For the car loan, removing the monthly payment will lower my monthly bills in case things get tough as well as provide additional funds for paying into the student loans before payments come due.  I expect I'll be able to pay off the student loans (for both myself and my husband) within 1-2 years of completing school.  This choice, while not attacking the highest interest, gives me peace of mind.  If hard times come, student loans are workable (IBR, hardship, etc) whereas the car loan isn't.

So the decision: highest interest or peace of mind?

politics,"Article Five Convention: How Wolf-PAC is Fighting to get Money out of Politics, and Save Our Republic. I Think Reddit Can Make a Big Difference Here!","I posted this a couple days ago as a comment, and got over 600 upvotes. People on reddit repeatedly encouraged me to make this into a self-post in /r/politics today, so that is what I've done. 
______________________________________________________

An article 5 convention can be called on the state level to circumvent Congress, the President and the Supreme Court. This was put into the Constitution by the founding fathers as a last resort to save the Union, if the federal government should become corrupted. The good news is, that this is already being pursued, and Vermont has already passed legislation showing their support! We need 2/3 of the states to do the same. More good news is that this has already been done before. In fact, it's been done, I believe, 233 times! And this is the first time we've ever had the power of the internet to rally people behind this. But time is of the essence, as we see the powerful are trying to destroy the internet, because it is their greatest threat. They will also, eventually, buy off our state and local representatives, if we let them. This moment in history will tell whether we are worthy of our democracy, because freedom is not free, and we need to fight for it.

The Young Turks, the most popular news and infotainment show on the internet, with ratings that compete, if not exceed that of any cable news program, is ONE of the populist efforts to make an article 5 convention a reality. This is a bipartisan effort, because republicans and democrats agree emphatically that money in politics is an enormous systemic problem. I know the bill has already passed the House of Representatives in California. I have read the bill, AJR1, and it is only a page long. I will link to it at later in this post if anyone would like to read it.

The Constitutional Convention would establish a new amendment to the constitution that states that money is not speech and corporations are not people. It's that simple, and it's something almost all Americans agree upon, regardless of party affiliation.

This was posted last week on the progress of the activists effort, and there are some videos of rousing speeches made by local and state representatives to save the union. I would recommend watching this video if not only for the speeches. Very inspiring stuff. More good news that these activists are reporting, is that our local and state representatives have mostly NOT been bought out yet! They are having success with just average constituents calling their representatives, and getting initiatives put forward in STATE government! Our democracy is not fully destroyed, but if we don't seize the moment, we will lose it. 

Anyway, here is the video: http://youtu.be/yUKbX9-XQG8

The homepage for this movement is **wolf-pac.com**

You can click on your state, and find your local and state representatives. There are likely already leaders organizing this in your state, and here you can find their contact information, and google messageboards where volunteers communicate and organize and report on their efforts. You can also donate money, which is given to pay volunteers who have time to take their work on full-time to organize volunteers and continue calling representatives. So, you know where your money is going, but if you cannot donate, then you can give your time and volunteer instead, making phone calls, sending mail, or whatever you have the time to do.

Getting money out of politics will remove the current incentive of politicians to be beholden to their donors so that they can get reelected (93% of candidates that get elected to Congress are the politician with the most money behind their campaign). Saying that money equals speech, and corporations are human, made bribery legal in our elections process. That pollutes our governments ability to do ANYTHING outside the interests of their donors in their insatiable pursuit of profit. It is the systemic cancer that is the reason behind why we cannot pass common sense measures that we all want!

I encourage you to research this more, if you should have any questions. I have followed the Young Turks, and Cenk Uygur, the founder of the network for at least 5 years. I can personally vouch for him, but I do not expect you to take my word, nor should you.

I wish more redditors knew about this, because we are such a powerful community. We could get this done faster than any website, I believe. As one of the men in the video I linked said, men before us have died for freedom- we should be able to pick up a phone.

personalfinance,Why did my Stafford loan payment double?,"I have a small (&lt;$2k) Federal Stafford loan that I've been paying $25/month on for some time. I recently got an interest rate reduction (for 48 on-time payments) which I guess brought it down to nearly zero (I think it's listed at .1% right now).

However, now suddenly I am paying $50/month on that loan. The interest rate hasn't changed -- it's just that now I'm paying double and it's going towards principle. I planned to pay that sucker off as slow as humanly possible so I could spend money on other things, but what happened here?",finance,1401575999
personalfinance,What's the point of paying off a loan if the payment doesn't go towards the principal?,"I apologize for the wordy title.

Okay, so, college student here. I'm going back to my summer job where I will make about $1.8k-2k net this year. It's not that much money, but it's a guaranteed job back home (and I am a freshman/in a major that doesn't have internships - a job's a job, yo) that I have and I can supplement it with babysitting and odd jobs, but it's not guaranteed so we'll stick with $1.8k-2k. I have an emergency fund and another 1k in my checking account.

This money buys textbooks, anything I need at school, etc. I also have a work-study job at school that doesn't pay much, but I may be getting another. I'm hoping to study abroad either next summer or the summer after, which would cost 3k-5k before scholarships. I would still be able to work if I did. Otherwise, I have been thinking about putting some money toward my loans.

I have federal loans, which I'm not worried about because I have many loan forgiveness options (teacher). However, I have a private loan that's $12k @ 8.25%. It's not ideal, but it's a 15 year loan so the rate is higher - I hope to pay it off much sooner. I also have a Roth IRA I started for myself with 1k in it, just to get something going there.

Anyways, I asked earlier in /r/pf and I was advised to put the 10% I was planning on holding aside into my private loan instead of my Roth IRA. Unfortunately, that's $200 - a flash in the pan. My private loan doesn't say how often the interest is capitalized, but if I were to pay it off today it would cost $500 more - so I assume it capitalizes annually. 

I know paying off my loan is essentially a guaranteed 8.25% return, compared to the average 4% return my Roth IRA will give. But my question is, if this $200 doesn't even go towards the principal of the loan balance, what's the point in even paying it towards the interest? I won't be making any more payments for another year or so, so this $200 seems like it would be better off in my bank account to help pay for study abroad or another semester's worth of textbooks. At the same time, I want to put myself in a better financial position because I will come out of school with some sizeable loans. My parents tell me to quit worrying about it because I am already vigilant about my finances (been using YNAB since it was free for students, except for textbooks I spend less than $200 a month and I've been within my budget), and that even if my debt:income ratio is high I will be okay because I am frugal and wise at managing my money. I suspect that they may be right.
