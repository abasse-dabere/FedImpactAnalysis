personalfinance,How long to wait to apply for new credit card after paying off existing one?,"Hi - I just paid off $9,750~ from my credit card which had a limit of $9,900.  This was a huge monkey off my back that I've been carrying since college and has hurt my credit rating, among other things, but I assume this was the worst.  This was a very high interest rate card that I applied for in college, so the card isn't super useful to me now that I've paid it off.

I'm not opposed to responsibly using credit and I'd like to apply for a United MileagePlus card which I've previously been rejected for.  Now that I have no credit card debt - **how long should I wait to re-apply for the credit card?**",finance,1401583432
Bitcoin,"Critical bug on CaVirtex, prior critical bug on MtGox, was Roger Ver allowed to withdraw all his 50,000 BTC prior to MtGox crash? My bitcoin story.","Prior to November 7th, 2013, CaVirtex had a bug where if you withdrew your coins multiple times really fast, you were able to withdraw more coins than you had in your account.  In specific, if you ran this code in your chrome browser, you were able to steal bitcoins.
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {        
    $.ajax({
            type: ""POST"",
            url: ""withdraw_btc"",
            data: ""amount=0.1&amp;address=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;step=confirm&amp;csrfmiddlewaretoken=******************""
        });
}
I had discovered this bug by playing around and for fun seeing if I could exploit various exchanges.  I had tried SQL Injection, Script injection and race condition exploit which are all common bugs that can be exploited to steal from exchanges.  I literally had an exploit that could have made me a millionaire overnight.  CaVirtex allowed you to login via Tor and deposit and withdraw bitcoins without being verified.  I decided however bitcoin was too important to try and destroy in Canada and I really liked what CaVirtex was doing.  I contacted the CEO and told him I managed to withdraw more bitcoins than I had and gave virtex back the coins I stole.  He immediately shut down the deposits and withdraws of bitcoin and fixed the bug within hours as per this message.

VirtEx
November 7, 2013
The withdraw BTC function at CaVirtex.com has been temporarily disabled while we makes some upgrades, which are required due to the recent increase in volume. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Being worried that someone might have discovered and exploited this bug I have asked virtex to prove their reserves.  To this day, virtex has not proved their reserves even upon repeated requests.  Until CaVirtex proves their solvency, I don’t suggest anyone put any coins there.  I have waited until now to tell this story hoping that cavirtex would at least try to make back the coins via trading fees if any coins were stolen due to this exploit.  I hope CaVirtex has full reserves and they keep serving Canadian bitcoin owners as I really like the work they are doing.

After I had discovered the exploit and after cavirtex had patched it up, I immediately told Mark Karpeles what had happened at CaVirtex and that he should check this hack on his exchange.  I tried the hack myself and was not able to find any exploits on MtGox.  Karpeles found what I did to be honorable and then for some reason he started telling me how his exchange had gotten hacked in the past!  He told me in 2011 a hacker had found a way to do SQL Injections on his exchange!  This means a hacker was able to read and write to the MtGox database.  He told me the 2011 crash was due to a hacker adding a fake balance to a random account and crashing the bitcoin price.  He also told me not to worry, that he did not lose too much money due to this exploit and has since made the money back.  He also since then allowed me to withdraw my cash whenever I wanted and I was allowed to take advantage of the 25% price difference between CaVirtex and MtGox on a regular basis so long as I withdraw the maximum amount of$ 100,000 to try and help the others in MtGox to be able to at least buy bitcoins and withdraw that way at a smaller premium.  I didn’t have this kind of money so I got investors to join in on the arbitrage with me.  He told me the reason MtGox was having problems with fiat withdrawals was because he got thrown out of his major bank and had to use a smaller bank which only let new customers do 10 wire transfers a day.  He said I would be allowed to be included in the list of people who were allowed to receive wire transfers and I was allowed to receive wire transfers once every two weeks so long as I didn’t tell anyone he was letting me do this.  When MtGox went bankrupt, Karpeles was trying to help me get my money out of the exchange as well as his other friends.  After doing arbitrage for a while, my banks got fed up with me and threw me out.  I had gotten thrown out of 3 banks for doing arbitrage.  I was lucky that 1 week before MtGox went down I had joined another bank, received half of my money and then was quickly thrown out of that bank too.  Most of the money at that point wasn’t mine as was my investors money.  He also tried to help me receive my bitcoins but said they might get “stuck” and I could only receive 20% of my total of 145 bitcoins.  Like an idiot I said I rather wait to withdraw all my coins at once and as of a result lost most of my money and all of my bitcoins.
At one point in time Karpeles told me Roger Ver had known everything that was going on with MtGox but Roger Ver was not allowed to say as he had signed a non disclosure agreement with MtGox.  Roger Ver is rumored to have had around 50,000 BTC with MtGox.  I am very curious if Roger Ver was able to get his 50,000 BTC out of MtGox while the rest of us are stuck to suffer.
All in all I tried to moral, I tried to help bitcoin by helping cavirtex and MtGox as much as I could but got burnt badly in the process.  I’ve been thrown out of multiple banks, government is probably investigating me for getting various bank accounts closed, I might get in trouble for white hat hacking to save people from losing their money, I lost investors money and I lost my own money.  I hope your bitcoin experience turns out better than mine.",cryptocurrency,1401589172
personalfinance,Retirement vs Debt with self employment income,"I've been struggling with this one... Thanks to divorce, relocating to follow kids and the housing market (and of course some bad choices along the way) I racked up a lot of debt a few years back. I've been digging out steadily sticking to my plan and at this point I'm about 2 years away from being completely debt free (from a starting point of being about $60k in the hole). 

I'm currently working a second job which was helping me keep solvent but I got a really good raise at my main job recently and now that second job is all surplus. I earn $2,000 a month from that though a lot of it goes to taxes (25% federal, 9% state and 15.3% FICA). That leaves me with a net in the $1,000 a month range. The question is, should I use that to pay down debt, or should I use it to fund a retirement account? 

I'm 36 and I feel pretty confident my day job is stable until I'm out of the hole in a few years, however the second job I'm less certain about. I currently have about $3,000 in my emergency fund and would like to bump that up to at least $5,000 (maybe $10,000) before anything else. I'm currently renting and need at least $3,000 if I ever needed to move (moving costs, deposits, first months rent, etc), plus I have a $1,500 deductible on my insurance, so I'm not comfortable with a bare minimum emergency fund. 

Normally I'd just go for debt payoff, however, because I'm dealing with self employment income there is a significant tax advantage to setting up something like a Simple IRA. I could put about $12,500 per year into a Simple IRA and get a nearly 50% return on that from income tax savings, plus whatever return it gets in investments. Thanks to the tax savings I could also max that out and have around $500 left over to put towards debt. 

Alternatively, I could just put $1,000 a month towards the debt and have it done in about a year...

Any suggestions? I feel like mathematically a Simple IRA wins out because of the tax savings, but given the secondary income might not be reliable longer term it might be beneficial overall to just pay off debt as quickly as possible...",finance,1401591389
ethereum,Proposal: meta-ethereum - mining and monetary policy as contracts,"I'm quite excited about Ethereum's stateful contract feature.  However, I'm concerned if other design choices, such as mining algorithm or monetary policy, will lead to the whole bundle of traits surviving the rough and tumble of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, or if one good idea (say stateful contracts) will go down due to other design choices (suppose the mining algorithm has a fatal flaw discovered later).

What if the core ethereum codebase was abstracted so that the mining work, mining verification, and monetary policies were all specified as special contracts?

For example, there might be a new field added to the block header which stores the code hash for a special *platform contract*. The platform contract would have state like the normal *user contracts*.

It would have access to *privileged opcodes* which could do things such as reading/writing any user contract's state.

It would take as input a previous block header, a list of transactions, the miner's address, and a deterministic CSPRNG seed. It's output would be a new block header.

The ""base"" account balances would be part of the platform contract's storage state, which allows it to implement any monetary policy, such as for example rewarding the miner address.  If mining requires a proof-of-work system like bitcoin's nonce guesses, this would be implemented as an internal loop.

The end result would be that different block chains could all run the same software platform, merely with different initial block states, which would include different platform contracts. Perhaps these different blockchains could even have tighter interaction features due to running on a common software platform.

I'm sure I saw something similar to this mentioned somewhere, so links are appreciated, and credit goes where due.

**edit:** Note that since the platform contract outputs a new block header, which includes a platform contract identifier, it is possible to implement adaptive blockchains. For example, it would be possible to change a proof-of-work algorithm according to a voting scheme.",cryptocurrency,1401594869
personalfinance,Advice for a recent graduate who is going into post-graduate training?,"Hello r/personalfinance! I've been reading through all the posts and FAQ and have finally decided to ask for help.

I am a recent graduate with 108,000 in federal loans ($36,750 subsidized, the remaining $71,250 unsubsidized with interest 5.4%-6.8%). I'm actually going into post-graduate training aka residency/fellowship which will give me a take-home pay of approximately $2,400 a month after taxes and 401K according to paycheckcity. My training will lasts for 2 years.

I will be moving in a month so I don't know exact amounts for monthly expenses: 

*rent $525, 
*groceries $200 estimated, 
*utilities $100 estimated, 
*gas $40 (I'm planning to bike/walk alot), 
*misc like clothing and sundries: $100, 
*entertainment (mostly eating out with friends): $50.

In addition, I expect my car/renter insurance to shoot up to about $1200/year after the move. I'm estimating about $500/yr for membership fees in organizations and malpractice insurance. I also need pay for the move and buy a professional wardrobe. I have no credit card debt and my car was gifted to me from my parents. 

Due to the post-graduate training which includes getting a masters, I can defer my federal loans. My current plan is to defer them all but start paying back the unsubsidized ones during the next two years. I read that interest on the unsubsidized direct get added to the loan principle after deferment - should I not defer the unsubsidized ones (or just not all) and try to pay off all my interest on them before my 6 month deferment period is up? I know to throw any money remaining at the unsubsidized loan with the highest interest rate. Using the standard repayment plan, I'll need to pay $1123/month which may work for me but will probably be very tight. 

Technically I'll be working for a nonprofit during these two years. I know that the loan forgiveness requires 10 years of working for a nonprofit and 120 scheduled payments. But I am unsure if I will be working for a nonprofit/government entity after my training is finished and a typical salary for my chosen career is approximately $100,000/yr   which doesn't really translate into loan forgiveness.

To defer or not defer? I also do really want to build an emergency fund and get a Roth IRA but I think my loans may be more pressing.",finance,1401598004
personalfinance,"Just applied for my first credit card, I am 20 years old. Is this a good deal?","I am a 20 year old college student working part-time. I have about $300-400 AUD that goes to bills per month. I am wanting to put this amount on my credit card each month then pay off the balance in full to gain good credit. Obviously I have done my research and found a (hopefully) decent card! 


Card - ANZ Low Rate

* 13.49% p.a. interest rate on purchases

* 21.74% p.a. interest rate on cash advances (I won't be using this feature)

* $1000 minimum credit limit (I am applying for $1500-2000 so I can utilise roughly 30% of my limit per month)

* $58 annual fee (which has been waived for the first year because this card is issued from the bank I am currently with)

* Up to 55 interest free days on purchases

I realise that paying an annual fee is not ideal but almost all other cards in my region require some sort of fee, or are with some entirely different lender/bank (I am trying to keep everything with my current bank). 

I considered rewards cards or frequent flyers (at a cost of a increased annual fee), but I will be using roughly $5500 per annum on the card, and the rewards/points I would receive basically amounts to $30 a year - which is next to nothing in my opinion.

Please critique my decision, I am currently awaiting approval from the bank!",finance,1401612548
personalfinance,Sit on 160k cash or pay down low interest debt?,"Trying this post again... 

Hi all, I would love some advice from the helpful folks here. My general question is whether I am stock piling too much cash for a future investment, when I have other things I could pay down with the capital.
About me: I am 32, married, no kids, and own a 2-family house. We are very comfortable and live a pretty modest lifestyle. I earn about $140k a year, and wife makes $35k. I am currently maxing my 401k and getting a generous match from my employer (which adds up to a match of ~17% of my base salary on top of the 12% I am saving). My total retirement savings is $253k.

I have about $15k in student loans which are at 2% interest rate. My mortgage is for ~$405k at 4.375% (this was actually a good rate for a multifamily), and I bought my home with 20% down. My total mortgage/interest/insurance is around $2500 and my rental brings in $1200. We save about $2k a month after all is said and done (not counting my annual bonus, tax return, etc).
My total cash in savings is around $160k. $15k is invested in an index fund, as I've gotten anxious keeping it all in cash.

My plan about 5 years back was to buy a multi-family house, live there for a while, and then save up and buy a single family house for us and keep the multi as a source of income. However for the time being, we really love our home, and have no intentions of moving. My thinking is to instead potentially buy another multi-family house (2 or 3 unit) which goes anywhere for $600-900k in my area. So I have been slowing building up the cash savings and entertaining the idea of buying again in the next several years, as a 20% down payment alone could be ~$180k and I would want to keep at least $20-30k in emergency reserves.

I see others on this sub making ""an extra mortgage payment a year"" and ""wiping out all my debt"" and it honestly always gives me a moment of pause to think about whether or not I am doing the right thing. The thinking is that if I pay down my debt (which all seem at reasonable interest rates) I will significantly set back any plans of buying another investment. Further, if I were to loan money for an investment property, the rate would definitely be higher than 4.375% (my current mortgage rate) because investment properties carry higher rates.

All this to say I feel we are in a very fortunate situation, and I am generally comfortable with what we are doing. However there seem to be many intelligent people on this sub, who are more sophisticated than I, and I am genuinely curious if they think my plan makes sense. I have thick skin, so feel free to be as candid as you like, as it wouldn't surprise me to hear I am being an idiot! :) Thanks.",finance,1401623884

personalfinance,What do you think about my financial plan for the future (NETHERLANDS),"Hi all,

I am a recent graduate of 26 and I got my first job since last Summer. I want to combine saving and investing so I have a safe retirement and can invest money into myself and perhaps start my own software company in the future. My ideal is to become financially indepent before I am 40. I have no significant other at the moment, but do hope that I will find someone to live with in the future.

Regarding the financial goals I have made a plan to start with which I will present below. I hope people can give input on the plan, share general insights they have when they read this text (thank you!), and offer me advice. 

**Work:**

My work is in the field of IT which I love. I did not study computer science (I have a degree in physics) and I have a starter salary now, but I learn a lot in a challenging environment and if I keep on investing my time and become more skilful I am sure I will earn more every year.

**Situation right now:**

 * **Monthly income** (avg) after taxes/mandatory retirement fund: EUR 1800
 * **Living expenses**: EUR 1250, consisting of:
 - rent: EUR 450 
 - shopping/food: EUR 300 
 - clothes: EUR 100 
 - personal care: EUR 50 
 - parties/relationships: EUR 150
 - personal growth: EUR 50
 - other taxes: EUR 50
 - phone: EUR 30
 - sports: EUR 20

**Debts**:

 * Student loans: EUR 30000*
 * Loan from parents: EUR 3000 

*I can take 15 years maximum to pay it back and the interest rate is 0,81%. I have not started yet with paying back.

I read [*The Richest Man In Babylon*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon_%28book%29) and that book inspired me to save and invest 1/10th of what I earn (200 EUR now), put 1/10th towards debts (200 EUR), and live on 7/10th (1200 EUR). The remaining EUR 200 goes towards vacations, a possible car, a driving license, a house (?), that type of stuff. If I earn more I will keep this ratio and increase the amounts.

I started doing this (more or less) since the beginning of this year and I have now saved 1000 EUR, I have 1000 EUR which I will put towards a driving license, paid back part from my debt towards my parents, and saved 500 for a vacation this Summer.

**1) What I want to do with the 1/10th for investing:**

Place the 1000 EUR in the stock market, and keep on investing 200 EUR every month there. I want to keep doing this till I am 66 years old so that I have about 1.000.000 then in the optimistic case of having an average of 10% annual return rate. This is money I cannot touch till later. Once the 1/10th becomes more I can make more shorter term goals then retirement for investing, but the 200 EUR is ""gone"".

Specifically:

My plan right now is to invest in ETFs/index funds. The 1000 EUR will be spend on an Information Technolology Index Tracker (e.g., [iShares Global Tech ETF](http://etfdb.com/etf/RYT/#overview)) and a Global Sustainability Fund (e.g., [Global Sustainability Index](http://www.northernfunds.com/pws/jsp/display2.jsp?XML=primary/fundinfo/NSRIX.xml&amp;TYPE=detail&amp;fundtype=eq)). I chose these two because I want to spread the investment, index trackers are cheap and do not cost a lot of time, and I feel good about the fields (IT and Sustainability).

So I will start with 1000 EUR investment, and then every month or two I get 400 EUR worth of more trackers (other ones as well). I read that I should probably also get some bonds, but I do not know which.

**2) What I want to do with the 1/10th for short-term savings:**

 - Get a driving license (around EUR 1500)
 - Buy a car (EUR 2000?)
 - Buy a house once I have better income and can get a mortgage

Besides this I want to keep some money apart to start working as a freelance programmer or perhaps start my own software company or work at a startup in the future. This share can become more if I earn more.

**3) Regarding the debt:**

I want to pay back my parents in 100 EUR a month so that I paid them back fully in 3 years. The student loans will take up 150 EUR a month for 15 years which I will have to start paying from the next Summer onwards.

This is my main plan for the coming 40 years. In short: 200 EUR a month investment in trackers for retirement, if 1/10th of incomes becomes more then 200 EUR I can invest for other goals as well; 1/10th a month for expenses like a car, a house, a vacation; 7/10th for living expenses, I can live a bit richer lifestyle if I earn more; and 1/10th to put against debts.

Thank you for reading, I hope you are willing to offer advice on or share your ideas about my financial situation/plan I laid out above.",finance,1401633313

I have recently decided to increase my contributions from 10% to somewhere in the 20-30% range. I purchased a house about a year ago and now I have three roommates contributing to the monthly housing expenses. I also have no children and realize how important it is for me to invest as much as I can during this period of my life. 20-30% translates to approximately $16-24k per year. I understand that the maximum I can invest into the 401k per year is $17,500 and my employer matches 6% of my 401k contributions. 

Is it best to max out the 401k and then put the remainder in a Roth IRA? 

Instead would it be better to match the 6% employer contribution, and put the remainder in the Roth IRA? 

Or is there kind of *sweet spot* between the two that I must find?

I know that the Vanguard Roth IRA is highly recommended on this forum. My 401k is managed by Wells Fargo and it would be very simple for me to have the contributions put into a WF Roth IRA. Will it really be a big advantage to me to use Vanguard instead of WF?

Also, I have about $20k that I am looking to put in a high-yield liquid acccount (savings, moneymarket, CD, etc.). This is my emergency fund.

stocks,Why I am shorting Arch Coal (ACI),"I rolled out a short position on ACI a few days ago, and coincidentally read this article today that further solidified my reasoning for being short ACI.

Other players in the coal mining sector are suffering even more, such as Walter energy and Alpha Natural Resources, which IMO is not such a good sign for the trade as their disruption and demise will only improve the position of the remaining coal miners.  Doing a trade on them, however, is just not worth it due to the high short interest and expensive put options.

Puts on ACI are cheaper, and the short interest less.  This may represent the fact that ACI has a stronger position than some of its competitors, but I don't that will be enough to save it in the long term.

There are no doubt long term headwinds to coal miners such as falling demand for coal for coal power plants, the rise of renewable energy, lessened use of steel in cars and other structures due to weight, and stricter regulations on pollution controls.

Arch Coal has enough money to weather the storm for 2 to 3 more years, but as it stands they are not a profitable company.  Really, what could turn it around is increased prices and demand for coal, which is something that to me seems somewhat unlikely to happen as the most important thing in regards to coal prices is the price of natural gas.  Fracking has simply made Natural gas too cheap to compete with, and solar and other renewable sources of power are just eating into the demand for coal.

The flip side of this is that developing nations may have a use for coal, although you have to wonder if in the long term will they too find it cheaper to use renewable energy as costs continue to drop?  What place will coal have, besides needing some amount for steel manufacturing and as a relic of a bygone era only found in the Christmas stocking of bad children, and Pennsylvania gift shops?

P.s.  Arch coal now under investigation by the feds http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/30/feds-arch-coal-workers-took-2m-in-kickbacks/9772765/",finance,1401651879

personalfinance,Forgot to file a state tax return after moving abroad. What would you do?,"Hi PF!


So I have a bit of a dilemma. I lived in Illinois for about a year beginning midway through 2012 before moving abroad in February 2013. I filed my 2012 federal tax return on time with no problems but forgot to mail my state tax return last April. (I couldn't file electronically because I didn't have a state driver's license.) Important to note (I think?) is that I didn't owe any state taxes. In fact, my tax prep software said I would receive a refund of several hundred dollars.


Now I'm filing my 2013 federal taxes after receiving a 2 month out-of-the-country extension, but I realized I forgot to file a state extension. Again, my tax prep software tells me to expect a refund from Illinois, but now I'm late in sending that return as well.


What would you do? I believe, if I were to send the two returns, I would owe late-filing penalties and that's it, since I shouldn't owe any taxes in addition to those already withheld by my company. Should I call up the state tax authorities and ask how to proceed? Or would you just forget about it, especially since I don't plan to live in Illinois ever again? Does it seem like they would come after me in the future, given the circumstances?


Thanks in advance, and apologies for any confusion. I've only filed taxes a couple of times in general; dealing with living abroad and returns for several countries/states is getting a little difficult and confusing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1401659846

I am 25 and just bought a home, closed three days ago. It is a 3 bed 2 bath for 100k at 3.25% on a 15 year. The monthly mortgage payment is 1.2K. I am living with a roommate that will pay 575 a month and half the bills. I plan on staying in the home for three years while I am in graduate school and then renting it out when I move. I am attending a JD/MBA program, which the JD is paid by scholarships and federal grants and MBA part should be 10k for three years (maybe I could have more scholarships there down the line). I receive 1.6k a month from my family for living expenses  for next three years and have 6.5k in a checking account earning 1.65%. I have no debt besides the mortgage and own a motorcycle and car. 

My goals are to pay the mortgage off early with summer work, get more scholarships/grants for MBA program, invest the remainder of my money prior to first professional job in areas where tax breaks are not important. 

Any advice is welcome on to what to do next.

personalfinance,"Traditional vs Roth,","When it comes to Traditional vs Roth, the common thought is you should pay your taxes when your tax rate is lower, ie if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, go Traditional, otherwise, Roth.  With this logic, most people go traditional since they expect to earn less in retirement.  But I believe most people mistaken what their taxable income really is, and combined with the possible taxation on Social Security, the situation could be complicated.

Let's say we make $80k and gives max our limit of $23k to our Roth plan.  We pay $13.5k in Federal income tax and get $43.5k to live on (actually way less after FICA, state tax, etc).  Let's say we double our investment by the time we retire and now get $46k, tax free.  Let's say we get $12k in Social Security (about 1/2 of today's rates, assume future reduction in benefits), we get a total of $58k.  There is no tax on SS because there aren't any other additional taxable income.

Our friend takes the $80k and gives the max of $23k to his Traditional plan.  He pays $7.5k in Federal income tax, and let's say he maintains the same $43.5k living style and put his $6k in tax savings into a taxable account.  His investment also doubles from $23k to $46k, plus $6k grows to, let's say $10k.  Now, let's say we get $12k in Social Security, $10.2k of that (85%) will be taxable along with ~~$56k~~ $46k of investments and $4k of capital gains, resulting in a tax of ~~$10k~~ $8k, leaving us with ~~$56.2k~~ $58.2k in retirement.

In the end, ~~the Roth option was slightly better~~ it came out about the same even though we were technically in a lower tax bracket in retirement.  I realize because we contributed so much, the taxable portion is skewed and I'm too lazy to work out other income and contribution levels; since this was mainly a Trad/Roth disagreement I had with some other people based on some pretty limited income and contribution ranges.  We could have both a Trad and a Roth, but other taxable accounts can squeeze out your traditional withdraws.  We could also not withdraw so much as to trigger tax on SS, but if we're saving that much into a traditional plan, our RMD is going to be pretty sizable.

What does the community think?  I originally started this off based on the concept that taxes makes a bigger impact when your income lower, so paying $10k in taxes on your $68k in retirement impact you more than $13.5k on your $80k while working, but the SS numbers turns out to paint a more convincing picture.  Certainly, it is more complicated than $80k while working + $68k in retirement = go traditional.

Edit: Not all of the $10k in the taxable account for the traditional case is subject to income tax, just the $4k in capital gains.  The plot thickens.",finance,1401665897

I have about 88k in student loan debt: $13k of that is a private loan at 2.5% and the rest is a consolidated federal loan at 7.25%. I plan on making the minimum payments to the private loan at $88 per month and then about $800 per month to the federal loan. According to unbury.us, that'll have me debt free by 2026. 

While I was unemployed, I completely drained my savings account, so I also need to build that back up again. I've budgeted about $500/mo to my savings every month. 

Here are my other expenses per month:
Rent: $250
Utilities: $100
Car Insurance: $50
Rental Insurance: $40
Cell Phone: $90
Netflix: $8

Here's my question: *Once I've saved enough to build an emergency fund (6 months worth of expenses), I'm thinking I should reallocate the money I would put into savings and redirect it to my loans. That would leave me debt free by 2020. Is this a terrible idea?* Let me note that during this time, I will also be contributing to my company's 401k at 6% (I just started working at this new job and they don't start the contributions till 6 months in, but I've guestimated that it'll be about $250 per month, with them matching).

Bitcoin,"Erowid, a non-profit drug educational organization, gives a detailed look at how they used Bitcoin as a source of donations since March 2011","I recently sent [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/splash.php) a question about their Bitcoin donations (the quoted parts) and I got an extremely detailed reply about their history with Bitcoin donations. Thought I would share.

But first, [here is a link](https://www.erowid.org/donations/donations_cryptocurrency.php) for donating with a wide range of crypto-currencies. 

&gt; I'm a regular user of Erowid and have donated some in the past and just some today: https://blockchain.info/tx/5fb862085e0803458d9e9e6ad97eebbc50c90132b161316913382249702dce46

Thanks! We really appreciate it. Bitcoin is one of the most useful and
interesting new payment systems since zero-fee paypal in 1999, which has
ended up nothing at all like it started. It's now a very useful
email-address-based gateway to the giant international VISA/MC
conglomerate. It's a handy system, but that whole transaction skimming
conspiracy is a little disturbing, costly, and monopolistic.

&gt; I was looking at your address and see that it is only a month old, yet you have been accepting Bitcoin since Mar 2011. In the spirit of openness I'm curious about why you changed addresses and 

Many Bitcoin advocates and technologists state that a new address for
every transaction is actually the right way to improve privacy and to
firewall tracking of payments and transactions. I believe that viewpoint
is kind of the opposite of openness, it is based on trying to keep
people's transactions more private, despite the entire BTC blockchain
database being fully public and exposed.

I spent some time a couple years ago trying to get a server-based wallet
set up that would generate a new address for each transaction and it
wound up being a lot harder than I could get working reliably. The more
unique addresses, the less erowid donors are tied together, thus a
little more privacy. We will try again at some point.

Currently, we keep a local bitcoin wallet and backups and rotate the BTC
addresses every month or three, depending on a variety of factors.


&gt; and how much you received on your previous ones. Also I would like to know if you hold a fraction of Bitcoin or convert all to fiat directly.

At the moment, I can give you a rough outline of how we choose when to
sell bitcoins. It different than people who are on the buying end. We
have always conceived of BTC as 'micro donations', but some number of
people over the years (let's say 30) have asked directly to pay for a
membership with BTC instead of other methods. In order for that to make
sense as an organization, we need to convert those bitcoins around the
time of the donation so that the donation in bitcoin results in the
amount near the dollar value that the donor was offering.

So, for a t-shirt that might be a $45 donation. If/when that happens, we
transfer the appropriate number of bitcoins out on or near that day to
convert BTC into USD. Then we can enter that person's donation into our
donation system and the accounting matches up: person gets a $45
membership, we get $45 into our bank account. Accounting is fun! :\

Further, because we are entirely a donation-based non-profit, we are
always in the position of trying to have BTC donations be of non-zero
USD value to the organization. That means selling them at some point.
The question of when to sell them is obviously complicated.

One can view BTC as a deflating currency or an investment or a security
or maybe a commodity.

We are generally conservative about them and have mostly sold the BTC
we've received within a few months of their donation in order to
generate USD for the organization. So, say we got 1 bitcoin 2 years ago
when they were worth $30 each. If it wasn't tied directly to getting a
sweatshirt or otherwise needed to wind up as a row in our banking
records, I would hold onto to the coin and wait for a time when the
value of BTC was going upwards and sell that bitcoin for more than it
was worth when we received it.  But I did not hold onto them for years,
since that defeats the purpose of supporting the organization and it
locks up the bitcoin trading market if everyone holds and never sells.

However, the goal is always to wind up with money in the bank sooner
rather than later, since we run a business.

As far as previous addresses go, I believe that the reasoning behind the
privacy concept is NOT to give out previous addresses, though obviously
it's a tiny figleaf.

We sold 1 BTC last week when the value hit $500 and another this week
when the value hit $600 and will probably sell again if the price
continues to rise. If I had a completely configurable trading system, I
would likely set a sell order for 1BTC at $675 OR sell 0.5 BTC in 14
days if the price is &gt;= $600. My reality is that I have to make the
sales manually, because I don't have a reliable trading site that
delivers to my US bank.

The vast majority of total bitcoins we've sold were sold for under $30 a
piece. When we opened our first bitcoin address to check out the system,
The Faucet gave me 1 BTC just to help get the ball rolling. Obviously
such things no longer exist and we're in a period where bitcoins are
both volatile AND valuable.

We had one donor give us some bitcoin back in early December and
requested we wait to sell it until it hit $1200, but ALSO required that
we open a separate account at a bitcoin trading company that took two
weeks to complete as the company confirmed our banking information and
identity, etc. By the time we'd gotten the new account set up, we were
well into the price crash and so we are holding onto that bitcoin for
some future price that is closer to what the person donated it at.

On the other hand, we received several BTC last september when they were
in the 100-200$ range and we sold all of those at between $800 and $1200
each in late november and early december as the price was running up.
That was actually during the fall of MtGox who was our only trade
location until October, 2013. I had initiated a sale of two bitcoins in
early September and six weeks later, MtGox had not deposited the money
in our account and had no estimate for when they would do it. Happily,
they credited my account the USD, I bought BTC, and moved them back to
an offline wallet.

I'm not sure how to be both transparent AND private, but I can tell you
the current address is typical of better months from the last year.  We
currently get a few hundred dollars a month in BTC, unless we're doing a
big fundraising push, in which case we get double or triple that.

With the price increase in the last 14 days, May was a good month.

Happy to answer more questions and chat about how we manage bitcoin, but
the main concepts to keep in mind are : trying to limit the exposure of
blockchains for privacy reasons, trying to optimize for USD coming into
our budget,  generally being conservative so we will choose to sell
rather than hold bitcoins, and having a rule of never selling all our
bitcoins but selling off parts of what we receive over time to reduce
risks and exposure.

We currently use coinbase and bitpay, after having gone through 10 or so
different BTC-&gt;USD systems. What we need is reliable and stable and most
of the others have run afoul of the federal money cops in the US and
have been shut down or had their banking connection shut down.

I'm always interested in recommendations for other trading / sales
sites, but we need one that can deposit into a US bank for it to be
useful for erowid center. And we need one that is stable, represents a
real business, and is unlikely to poof into a cloud of oily smoke.

I see today we got a .01 and a .05 bitcoin donation to the current
address, bringing our total for the last month up to .654 ish, which is
great! With the price heading upwards (rather than hovering at $400),
that's actually a useful amount of money. Thanks!

Looking at the charts today, it seems like a lot of people decided to
start selling as the price hit 650+ and so the price had a small crash
today while I wasn't paying attention.

Anyway, hope some of that is useful. Erowid Center's budget (income and
expenditures) are all public information, but our list of donors is not
and we do what we can to protect the privacy of the people who choose to
support our controversial project.

Thanks again for your contribution! Hurray that you didn't have to pay
VISA 0.35 + 2% to do it.

personalfinance,Buying a house in the US for cash from overseas,"Hi all,

I'm a 23 years old international Ph.D. student living in Silicon Valley, where I also plan to stay and work after graduating. My mother lives in Russia, and we co-own an apartment, which for several reasons we are now exchanging for one or two smaller ones. The deal is not fully sorted out yet, but most likely it leaves us with about extra $100'000 in cash (yes, actual bills - the market is that crazy there). Neither of us have any loans or mortgages, and there are pretty much no safe investment options in Russia. Thus, we thought about using that money to buy a small house where I live.

[A quick search on craigslist](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/rea?sale_date=-&amp;minAsk=50000&amp;maxAsk=150000#map) reveals that there are indeed some 2BR or even 3BR houses for that price, and I assume real estate brokers may have even more offers not listed there. [This article](http://moneyover55.about.com/od/taxtips/qt/taxesonhomesale.htm) suggests I won't be paying any federal taxes from this purchase. [This PDF](http://www.californiacityfinance.com/PropTransfTaxRates.pdf) suggests that if I buy a house in Sunnyvale or Santa Clara (which are the most likely options, according to craigslist, and the most convenient for my commute to Moffett Field) I'll pay 0.11% local tax. Mountain View, Palo Alto and San Jose would cost 0.44%.

**Is this correct, and are these taxes paid in addition to or instead of the standard 7.50% sale tax?**

[Frizber Property Tax calculator](http://tax.fizber.com/) indicates that for a $100'000 house I'm gonna pay $670 property tax per year. I have no idea wha is the typical amount of HOA payments, but after seeing vary luxurious condos asking for $300/mo I assume it's not gonna exceed that for a modest house. **Can I get a more accurate estimate of HOA payments if they're not listed in the ad?** However, **I don't know where to look for typical insurance rates, and what the policies typically cover: fires, earthquakes, burglary?** Utilities, I assume, will be within the limit of $150/mo. All this, as far as I understand, leaves me with the monthly payments much less than my current $1000/mo rent. **Is this correct?**

With [Google Bus raising housing prices all over the Bay Area](http://www.sfweekly.com/2014-02-19/news/evolution-of-protest-google-tech-bus-apple/), [zoning laws preventing the growth of the housing market here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2011/09/19/zoning-laws-are-strangling-silicon-valley/), and tech companies including [Apple building more offices nonetheless](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ekhf45mfff/apples-new-mothership-2/), I find it pretty unlikely that the value of real estate in Bay Area will go down significantly, if at all, within next 10 years at least. Thus, I consider it to be a good investment, which would always provide me with the possibility to sell the house and move elsewhere to a much nicer one (if I overcome my strong affection for Bay Area), or use this money to reduce the mortgage for a new house, or just live there. **Am I missing something, and are the prices likely to go down?**

As far as I understand, as a non-resident alien, I don't have to pay taxes from any income generated outside of the US. Neither do $100k exceed the nontaxable gift limit. Thus, whether it's gonna be my mother who puts the money to a Russian bank account and does a wire transfer to my American checking account, or I'm gonna do it from mine (the first option is preferable since it's less likely to concern the Russian tax service), **it's not gonna be axed neither by IRS nor by California. Is that correct?**

There is always a risk that sometime I'm not gonna be given the US visa. All the circumstances considered, I estimate it to be less than 1%, but it still exists. For this case I though about finding an attorney who would be able to sell or rent out the house. **How much is that gonna cost, and can it be done remotely?**

**Am I missing any hidden significant expenses and risks?**

**How much taxes am I gonna pay if I buy a house and how much if I sell it? What is the exact step-by-step process of buying a house for cash?**

personalfinance,How to Best Save Funds For Mortgage Principal Payment Fund,"Good morning PF,

My girlfriend and I are in the process of purchasing a condo. We have been preapproved by Penfed and are most likely going with a 5/5 or 15/15 ARM, but both agree that if we do choose an ARM product we will set aside the difference between the 30yr fixed rate we qualify for and the lower ARM rate so that we will have some dedicated cash/liquid assets on hand to make a big principal payment right before a hypothetical high rate retarget.

We are buying a cheap enough condo that we will be able to afford the worst case scenario ARM rate increases if it comes to that, so we are willing to accept some risk on this money, I'm thinking index funds, high dividend single stocks etc.

Where's the best place to keep this money? It doesn't look like this would be a qualified IRA/401k distribution (and we are already at max roth), are there any other options that would be better from a tax perspective than just an individual investment account?",finance,1401715094
personalfinance,Should I consolidate my HELOC and mortgage?,"I have $33,280 left on my 15-year home mortgage, which at the fixed rate of 4.875% would be paid off by 2017. However, I also have $162,000 on a HELOC which is a variable rate mortgage that is now at 3%, but obviously could and probably will go up over time. My bank has suggested I consolidate both the 15-year and the HELOC into one 10 or 15-year mortgage so that I don't risk paying a lot more over time on the HELOC if interest rates rise. Is this a wise move, or should I just pay off the 15-year and worry about the HELOC in three years (or switch it to a fixed rate if rates start inching up?)",finance,1401720577
personalfinance,Questions regarding CC debt consolidation options,"Hi! My wife and I have about $16,000 in CC debt spread amongst 4 or so cards with interest rates between 9% and 23%. We put about $800/month towards them, and with a few projected big payments (next years tax refund, for example) we're projecting to have it paid down in 18 months. However, we'd love to lower those payments - and we're looking at either getting a loan through something like Lendingclub.com (we were offered a loan with interest around 8%) or possibly refinancing our house and cashing out extra to pay down the cards. We have $180K left on the first mortgage, and the home is now valued at something like 300K. The rate for that is something like 4.5%, so I'm looking around to see if we could find better rates…Anyways, let me know what you think - any advice is appreciated!",finance,1401721824
personalfinance,Debt free - looking for advice on how to structure our future,"Me and my wife are in a great position right now and we're looking to start our own independent research on how we can best structure our financial instruments to save for our future.

Here is our current situation:
We have no debt, including two cars that should run for the next 10 years. 
We are currently purchasing a home in cash (will leave us with approximately 30k leftover that we are keeping as an emergency fund. We will not finance the home - I understand how the interest rates and the deduction work.)

Our net income is going to be around $110k. We plan to live off approximately 35k, and save around 75k for the next 10 years, so that my wife can either retire or move to a part time job when our triplets are around 12-14 years old, so that she can spend more time with them. 

Our goal is to have 1 million in savings over the next 10 years, have my wife retire, and have me continue to save approximately 30k a year, with the rest of my income going to our living expenses for the next 15 years beyond that, and that should have us retiring with approximately 3 million in savings due to the magic of interest.

We live in Texas.

What is the best way to structure our investments to minimize both our lifetime taxes and any inheritance tax for what we leave behind for the children? I do not know much about the different types of accounts that are available, the limits for each, and how we should structure these accounts. One thing I'm specifically interested in is whether a living trust would be a suitable mechanism for this, and how they are structured and invested.

Thanks for your time and helping me get researching in the right direction. We will talk to a fee based financial adviser at the conclusion of our independent research before we make any actual moves, but I want to be educated going into the meeting.",finance,1401722273
Bitcoin,2014-06-02 blogdejuanllanos.com: Si un país adoptara una moneda como Bitcoin,"http://blogdejuanllanos.com/2014/06/02/si-un-pais-adoptara-una-moneda-como-bitcoin/

[Tiempo de lectura: 7 minutos]

Hace unos meses, una consultora Latinoamericana me pidió comentar sobre el Sucre Digital y el potencial impacto que podría tener la adopción de una moneda digital o criptográfica por parte de un país, como moneda de curso legal.  Nunca se me ocurrió publicar mis superficiales respuestas hasta que Bailey Reutzel, reportera de la publicación American Banker se hizo la misma pregunta (aquí).  Con el entonces inminente lanzamiento de la fallida moneda AuroraCoin en Islandia y la adopción de un clon de bitcoin por la nación indígena Oglala Lakota en los Estados Unidos, parece ser un buen momento para estimular el debate.  Así que aquí van mis dos centavos de contribución que espero generen más y mejores ideas y pensamientos.

Conceptualmente, ¿es bitcoin más una moneda o un sistema de pagos?

Bitcoin es ambos. Además, lo cual es más importante y fundamental, es también un protocolo sobre el cual se pueden construir otras funciones y aplicaciones.  El hecho de que Bitcoin (con B mayúscula) sea múltiples cosas a la vez es lo que causa tanta confusión en la gente.  Bitcoin es un registro o bitácora digital distribuido globalmente y de una alta sofisticación que, en la actualidad, se utiliza más que nada para registrar valor en dólares u otras monedas. De ahí que se lo interprete como una commodity or como una categoría de bien digital con su valor correspondiente expresado en moneda de curso legal.  Ahora, dada su novedad y el potencial de crecimiento del valor de Bitcoin como protocolo de pagos, existe mucha especulación y el valor del bitcoin (con b minúscula) se está moviendo como una montaña rusa.  Y para confundir las cosas un poco más, bitcoin (con b minúscula) también tiene características de una moneda de curso legal, porque se lo puede utilizar como medio de intercambio, aunque todavía no hay consenso sobre si alguna vez podrá comportarse como almacén de valor o como unidad de medida con la estabilidad que teóricamente se espera de las monedas.

¿Es más fácil para un estado-nación establecer el valor de una cripto-moneda que para una institución privada?

No estoy seguro de comprender el significado de “establecer el valor de una cripto-moneda”.  El valor de cada unidad expresado en otras monedas lo establece un mercado abierto.  Ni una nación ni una entidad independiente puede “establecer el valor” de la moneda bitcoin.  Por ahora, al menos.  Si se trata de establecer una cripto-moneda y punto, nada le impide a una nación-estado crear y/o adoptar una cripto-moneda como moneda nacional.  La cuestión es si sería fácil hacerlo.  Me parece que se le haría más difícil a un estado o gobierno establecer y adoptar una cripto-moneda, debido a los altos costos que implicaría cambiar de un sistema a otro.  Es decir, es más simple para un individuo o grupo comenzar a usar Bitcoin como almacén de valor y red de pagos que para una nación entera.

“Bitcoin es un registro o bitácora digital distribuido globalmente y de una alta sofisticación que, en la actualidad, se utiliza más que nada para registrar valor en dólares u otras monedas”.

¿Qué medidas regulatorias deben acompañar a una moneda virtual para que esta tenga legitimidad contra el lavado de dinero y el fraude?

El desafío con las monedas virtuales como Bitcoin es que éstas les dan a un individuo con el equipo adecuado y conexión a internet la facultad de realizar dos funciones que tradicionalmente han sido responsabilidad de intermediarios altamente regulados y controlados: almacenar valor y enviar dinero en cualquier monto a cualquier parte del mundo sin tener que identificarse a sí mismos o a los beneficiarios de sus transferencias.  Obviamente, esto trae aparejados muchos problemas.  Es relativamente fácil obligar a una institución a reducir sus riesgos de lavado de dinero y fraude, pero ¿cómo reglamentar a millones de individuos?  Para que estas nuevas tecnologías tengan legitimidad y sean menos atractivas a los delincuentes financieros, todos los participantes del ecosistema, ya sea cambiadores, procesadores de pagos y proveedores de almacenamiento digital,  deberán adoptar altos estándares de identificación del cliente y cumplir con normas existentes (u otras nuevas).  La instrumentación de controles contra riesgos reales o percibidos tiende a generar confianza en los consumidores y en los organismos de control.  Sin embargo, esto va a llevar bastante tiempo.  Mientras tanto, el gobierno de Estados Unidos estableció a través de una guía interpretativa publicada el 18 de marzo de 2013 que ciertos participantes de la industria de las monedas virtuales son transmisores de dinero y por lo tanto están sujetos a una serie de normas federales que los obligan a conservar registros, establecer programas antilavado e instrumentar protecciones para el consumidor.  Con respecto al fraude, ciertas tipologías con imposibles dada la naturaleza misma de las monedas virtuales y otras necesitan mitigarse mediante medidas de seguridad informática.

¿Quiénes son los organismos del gobieron o sistemas financieros que se oponen a las monedas digitales?

No he escuchado que ningún gobierno o miembro de la industria de servicios financieros se haya opuesto abiertamente a las monedas virtuales [Nótese que respondí este cuestionario a principios de septiembre del 2013], pero no es difícul imaginarse que deben estar preocupados.  Muchas agencias federales y de los estados han expresado públicamente su preocupación frente a los riesgos de lavado de dinero y financiación del terrorismo que las monedas virtuales traen aparejados y han iniciado investigaciones oficiales.  A modo de ejemplo puedo mencionar la orden de cesación y desistimiento (una especie de interdicto prohibitorio) que el estado de California envió a la Fundación Bitcoin hace unos meses [en mayo de 2013] y las citaciones del estado de Nueva York de mediados de 2013 por las que instaba a unas dos docenas de empresas a enviar información detallada sobre sus operaciones y servicios, sus planes comerciales y sus estructuras de control.  Asimismo, la Comisión de Seguridad Nacional del Senado solicitó al Ministerio de Seguridad Nacional explicaciones acerca de qué se está haciendo para mitigar los riesgos de las monedas virtuales.  La Comisión de Comercialización de Futuros para Commodities también ha expresado interés en investigar si los bitcoins, en tanto se los considere como commodities, deberían estar sujetos a la normativa emitida por esta agencia.  Fuera de Estados Unidos las reacciones ante esta nueva moneda han sido de variada índole, pero ninguna especialmente negativa u opositora.  Lo más cercano a una postura opositora ha sido tal vez la reacción del Banco de Tailandia, que según se informó en julio pasado había suspendido el intercambio comercial de bitcoin debido a la ausencia de controles y leyes aplicables.  [Otra vez, ¡perdón por los anacronismos!  Si desean una actualización sobre las reacciones de los gobiernos del mundo ante Bitcoin, pueden consultar mi crypto-cronología o este servicio.]

Ecuador está considerando adoptar el Sucre digital como su nueva moneda, a pesar de que la moneda oficial sucre está extremadamente devaluada.  ¿Qué significaría esto para el Ecuador?

La mera adopción de una moneda digital no protege a ésta de una devaluación.  Lo que hace a Bitcoin anti-inflacionaria es el hecho de que la frecuencia de emisión de estas unidades que se llaman bitcoin está predeterminada en el propio software, al igual que el total de unidades que se pondrán en circulación.  En otras palabras, el “sistema monetario” de bitcoin no se basa en el modelo de reserva fraccionaria, el cual es inherentemente inflacionario.  Si Ecuador adopta una manifestación digital de una moneda emitida bajo un esquema de reserva fraccionaria, la moneda será simplemente eso, una moneda inflacionaria digital.  Lo que sería interesante es ver qué pasaría si Ecuador o cualquier otra nación, en realidad, adoptara el bitcoin u otra moneda digital no-inflacionaria como su moneda de curso legal.

“Si Ecuador adopta una manifestación digital de una moneda emitida bajo un esquema de reserva fraccionaria, la moneda será simplemente eso, una moneda inflacionaria digital”.

Hipotéticamente, ¿podría un Sucre digital bien reglamentado mejorar la economía del Ecuador y de sus socios comerciales?

Depende de qué quiere decir con “bien reglamentado” y con “Sucre digital”.  Me atrevería a decir que la adopción de una moneda digital no-inflacionaria, es decir, no una manifestación digital de una moneda de reserva fraccionaria existente, podría cambiar completamente las reglas del juego y constituir un factor más en la estabilización de una economía deteriorada.  Sin embargo, sería simplista pensar que solo naturaleza de la moneda es lo que contribuye a mejorar la economía de un país.  En una economía moderna existe una multitud de factores micro y macroeconómicos, todos interconectados.

¿Qué podrían perder el Ecuador y los países del ALBA al adoptar una cripto-moneda?

Esto puede sonar gracioso pero lo que un país podría llegar a perder al adoptar una cripto-moneda como bitcoin, es decir, una moneda diseñada para no ser inflacionaria, es la capacidad de manipular el sistema monetario para el beneficio propio de un gobierno.  Los sistemas de reserva fraccionaria les permiten a los gobiernos regular indicadores macro-económicos de manera similar a como una válvula regula la evacuación de vapor, por ejemplo.  Sin embargo, ahí yace el problema –unos pocos tienen el poder de controlar a los muchos y, si no se actúa de manera responsable, las consecuencias de corto y largo plazo para la mayoría de la gente pueden ser desastrosas.  Una cripto-moneda como bitcoin quita de en medio incluso a las autoridades monetarias centrales y le entrega al mercado la facultad de regular la moneda.  Por otra parte, si un gobierno controlara centralmente una moneda digital, no sería descabellado imaginar que éste pudiera lograr un altísimo porcentaje de recolección fiscal o de cumplimiento de las obligaciones contractuales.  Una plataforma digital como Bitcoin es una poderosa herramienta cuyo valor trasciende lo meramente económico.

Las relaciones económicas de Ecuador con Irán ponen en tela de juicio las prácticas bancarias.  Con el Sucre digital, Irán podría teóricamente acceder al sistema financiero mundial a través de una única localidad.  ¿Cree que esto podría perjudicar o fortalecer la economía ecuatoriana, tal vez en términos ilícitos?

Esa sí es una proposición interesante: ¿qué pasaría si dos o más naciones adoptaran la misma cripto-moneda y comenzaran a crea un “universo económico paralelo”?  Aquí se puede empezar a ver el poder potencial de las cripto-monedas de desafiar la hegemonía de Estados Unidos como nación más poderosa del mundo.  Esto provocaría desplazamientos tectónicos geopolíticos cuyo impacto es difícil imaginar.  Otra vez, la razón por la que le es posible hoy a Estados Unidos exigir el cumplimiento de sus embargos y sanciones (Cuba, Irán, Corea del norte, etc.) es que los intermediarios financieros son relativamente escasos.  Si una nación adoptara una moneda digital que esté conectada con el sistema financiero solo en las fronteras, es decir, en los puntos de traducción de las monedas, nada impiría a esa nación transar con quienes se le ocurriera dentro de su propio universo digital.  Si esto perjudicaría o fortalecería la economía de una nación está más allá de mis facultades predictivas, pero no me cuesta imaginar que las reglas del juego tal como hoy las conocemos serían diferentes.  Y sí, el potencial de movimientos ilícitos de fondos existe.  Cada transacción que alguna vez haya existido queda resgistrada en la bitácora pública de Bitcoin, lo cual lo hace muy poco atractivo para los delincuentes financieros individuales, pero ¿qué pasaría si es un gobierno el que controla esa bitácora pública?

“Lo que un país podría llegar a perder al adoptar una cripto-moneda como bitcoin, es decir, una moneda diseñada para no ser inflacionaria, es la capacidad de manipular el sistema monetario para el beneficio propio de un gobierno”.

¿Qué podrían esperar Estados Unidos y Europa con el lanzamiento de una moneda virtual de Ecuador y el ALBA, dado el antagonismo de esta alianza frente a los EE.UU. y al resto del mundo financiero?

Me imagino que cualquier amenaza contra el actual equilibrio de poder no pasaría inadvertida frente a quienes ejercen hoy el poder real y sería ingenuo pensar que no habría oposición a ese evento.

¿Cree que el Sucre del futuro podría convertirse en el equivalente latinoamericano de lo que el euro es para Europa?

Pienso que la aparición de monedas digitales criptográficas descentralizadas va a desafiar todos los paradigmas actuales en el mundo de las finanzas, los pagos, el dinero y el derecho contractual.  No podría predecir que el Sucre se vaya a convertir en el Euro de latinoamérica, pero veo claramente un futuro en el que lo vertical se va a ir haciendo cada vez más horizontal y lo central, cada vez más periférico, donde la responsabilidad personal y la libertad van a tener la oportunidad de reinar como nunca antes en la historia.",cryptocurrency,1401723318

personalfinance,Don't use payday loans.,"I do some ghostwriting for my best friend's law firm and ended up doing some research on payday loans for a online quiz on them.

Here's the mentality that people use when considering a payday loan:

1. I don't want to borrow from friends or family.
2. I don't want to (or can't) use credit cards because the debt will last too long.
3. I don't want to (or can't) wait until I get an influx of cash.
4. Therefore, I'll just take this payday loan.

The problem is payday loans come in 2-week periods and you have to pay them back ALL AT ONCE. You can't make payments on them. So, for example, if you took out a 1000 dollar payday loan, you wouldn't be able to pay it back until you've saved up the full 1000 anyway. 

So, in the mean time, you're forced to renew the loan over and over again. The fee for which is probably about 200 dollars. 

So after 2.5 months, you've paid 1000 in fees alone, and you STILL owe the original 1000. Yes, that's a 400% (or higher) interest rate.

And the reality is that most people are trapped in these loans for an average of 5 or 6 months. How do they get out? Usually by doing one of the things they didn't want to do originally: go to family, or use an influx of cash like a tax return.

I have savings of 40K on my saving account for emergency fund.

I bring home close to 125K per year.

The suggestion I need is:

last year I didnt know anything about investment so I dumped by 100K in
5 year jumbo cd yielding at 1.74 it will be exactly one year today.

Since now I have been educated about stocks and bond do you think it will be wise decision to take out that 100k
and put it into my taxable account basically balance my all portolfio though? 

The penalty will be I need to pay one year interest rate which is $1740 which I made since last year so it will be considered as sitting on 
checking account for last year if I withdraw it today.

Please let me know what should I do also suppose if we withdraw it 

What is the best approach to buy funds in taxable account?

personalfinance,pay off student loans or put money in savings as a graduate student?,"Hello! Last time I posted a question on here about my financial situation I received some great advice that I followed, and was very happy with the outcome. Thank you! So here I am again, with another question in hopes of getting some help from all of you :)

I am a graduate student with no credit card debt (thanks to you all!), but I now have about $70,000 in student loan debt, that is gaining about $300/month in interest. These loans are divided up into 3 groups...2 of them are through my bank and have high interest rates (10.24% and 8.74%), and the last is my combined federal loans, some subsidized and some unsubsidized, with interest rates ranging from 4.5%-6.8%. I am not required to start paying all of my student loans back until I graduate with my PhD.

Basically, I'm wondering if I should be putting $400/month toward my loans so they don't gain any more interest (they've already gained about $14,000 in interest combined), or if I should instead be putting that money into a savings account.

My credit score is quite high (775 range), and I want to buy a house as soon as possible. Is it possible to get a good deal on a house loan if you have a large amount out in student loans, yet a good credit score?

The past couple months I've been putting my money toward my student loans rather than a savings account. But am I just throwing away my limited amount of extra money each month by using all of it to simply keep the amount of interest from growing? At this rate it would take me forever to chip away at the interest before I even start being able to pay off principal, so it seems kinda silly to do so. But if I don't start putting it toward my loans, I'll be gaining about $4000/year in interest in my current situation.

Thank you for your time! All help is greatly appreciated :)",finance,1401729290
personalfinance,Student loan payments seem too high...What do I do?,"So here are some details:

I have a total of 393.23 in monthly payments and 120.00 in quarterly, plus I'm waiting for a few other Perkins loans to kick in from somewhere... I have a total of about 64,000 in student loans (about 22k in Private and 42k in Federal)

It seems like these repayments are really high - especially for my first year out of school. 

I've tried talking to the companies servicing the loans and they all say to fill out an income based repayment plan... unfortunately I make about 75k right now, so I don't think that's going to help. But I know for a fact that this job is going to be disappearing in a year and I'll be SOL once it ends. 

I'm an actor (yes - that's what I'm paid to do) so I don't think there is a possibility of loan forgiveness...

personalfinance,"PF - Looking at buying/renting - need advice - Student loans (should we do IBR), baby on the way, etc","Hi PF,

Long time lerker, but really need some advice.

Me: 26, going on 27, 100k/year job with about 20-30k in commissions extra (never assume its guaranteed so I'm leaving it out of total). Total yearly income between 120 and 130 if you include commissions.

I contribute 7% of salary + 50% company match to 401K. Contribute to Roth as I can - I rolled over an old employer's 401k into one this year totaling 2400, so have about 9k in a Roth. Have 62k in 401k. Contribute 100 a month to an account that gets 4% from Prudential - currently sitting at about 5000.

Currently have 46k in savings that's collecting 2% per year (divided into 4 accounts with spending goals - e.g. 15 debit card swipes per month).

Own car - no payments.
No Credit card debt.

Wife - 25, just graduated law school. Has over 200k in Student Loans - all Federal - no private, interest rates go between 3 and 7 percent. The normal repayment would be about 2400 a month.
No credit card debt.

Oh and we're having a baby in December.

We're looking at buying a house or renting so that when the baby comes we have a place to call home that's not an apartment complex. We don't want to be that couple with the screaming baby that wakes you up at 3AM because our walls are too thin.

She's looking for a job currently and has things lined up where she can make about 40-50k a year upon passing the bar. This could go more or less 100% to her loans. We've lived off of my 1 salary the past 2 years just fine as her loans were just for tuition and not anything else - amazing how expensive school is...).

We've been preapproved for a Mortgage between 150 and 225k (that was the range I gave the loan person saying I don't want to know the high end so as to not stretch my budget, not that 225 was the top end of the sheet)- which would be a mortgage payment between 750 and 1300 basically depending on amount down, final costs, yadda, yadda. When renting, the houses in the area we're looking for in that range are kind of, well sketchy, but do-able. I know renting isn't the commitment buying is and why it is still appealing to me. 

Expenses Monthly:
Groceries - 300-400 - I travel a lot so this actually can be much less. The 400 range would include 2 eat outs a month not planned

Entertainment/Activities/etc - 100-200 month
Netflix - 8/month
Internet - 25-40/month - currently pay 25, but know that this could change with the move
Insurance - Car/Renter's - 85/mo
Maintenance/Gas/Utilities - 120/mo
Cell phone - 75/mo

Take home pay is about 5300-5600/mo after taxes/health insurance/etc - can adjust allowances too to increase it higher based on my 7k refund this year.

Being Moronic Monday - how stupid are we for even thinking about buying with the amount of student loans that she has? Should we look to pay them down more first and then look? Can we even afford to do this? In my head, every spreadsheet I've looked at and built says we can. Should we do the Income Based Repayment - with her making 50k a year the repayment isn't high, so the short term looks nice, but is not really good long term. If she takes a public service job, it's probably at pay around 40k, but the 10 year plan is nice.

My parents have offered to help with child care once the baby gets here, so hopefully the finances won't change TOO much.

personalfinance,Savings Account Investment Question re: Municipal Bond Funds,"First, I think some background is necessary, but I will try and keep it short. My wife and I are both young professionals (~30) with advanced degrees, from which we compiled significant student loans (total ~ 360k).   Although they were all federally backed, we still had many with interest rates in the 6-8% range (and the interest can only be deducted in limited amounts). We therefore recently bought her parent's house as an investment property with a 15 year mortgage at ~4.2%. Her parents then loaned us back the money at 1%, but given their generosity, I would not be surprised if they forgive some / most of the annual payments on that note (also 15 years). With that money we repaid almost all of our student loans and now have a $2,000 / month mortgage on that property. 

We make about $210k a year right now, but soon our pay scale may be in the 300-400k range, and we each put ~12% in our 401ks. No kids at this time, but probably not too far off. We have about $40k in our savings account, but I was thinking about opening up on online trading account and investing $20k in municipal bond funds, primarily VWITX and/or FLTMX. Given that it is her parent's house I want to have enough in cash, but at the same time earn a better rate than our current savings account. 

What are the community's thoughts on investing in municipal bond funds as part of a savings account / emergency fund? Any other alternative strategies I should be thinking of?

**$18,917.52 @ 7.99 %**. This started as a $15,000 U.S. Bank loan, which got tossed around until I ultimately found it back in March. The loan never hit my cosigners credit score and honestly I never really searched that hard to find it and pay interest. Which was stupid.

**Federal Loans**:
Stafford Loans totaling **$31,975.55**, including interest. I'll break down by sub/unsub as follows: 

Subsidized **$11,000 @ 3.4%**
Subsidized **4,500 @ 4.5%**
Subsidized **2,370 @ 5.6%**
Unsubsidized **10,130 @ 6.8%**

The Bad News:
So, obviously I've got quite a bit of student loan debt. Right now I work full time, but barely clear 20k/ year. This should double soon as a job prospect is working out. 

The Good News:
As of right now I have exactly **$23,064** in my bank account. Besides taking out all these student loans, I'm very good with my money. No credit card debt, pretty frugal, and I don't really go out and spend money unless it is necessary.

Questions: 
My first thought is to completely pay off the loan with the highest interest rate (debt snowball), all 18,917.52 of it. This doesn't leave me with much savings, but much less debt. Is this the right thing to do?

If I choose a 20 year repayment plan on the other loans, does this prevent me from future consolidation, or is it still possible?

Is anyone familiar with credit unions buying loans and allowing you to get rid of your cosigner? I read about it awhile ago, but I haven't found much helpful information.

I have a few separate loans out in the wild taken on by multiple debt collectors. I have been paying 2 of them for over 3 years now. 1 at 700/mo the other at 450/mo.

So it seems like I validated those debts on my own. I talked to both of them about a settlement but was told that it looks better on my report to be paid in full. From what I read, it makes no difference if I pay it off or leave it alone.. because a negative remark is a negative remark.

I have a few other loans that I haven't ever responded to or paid. These are loans from 2006-2008. **side question: does statute of limitations apply to student loans (private or federal, I have a mix) with a debt collector?**

I took the top comments advice from the article I linked above and disputed these charges through all 3 credit bureaus today.

It seems like I should be sending debt validation letters out next? But if I haven't heard from some of these companies in a while, is it worth restarting a conversation at this point? I've lived in both NY and NJ over the past 5 years. Statute of limitations are 6 years in each state it seems. Does moving back and forth affect anything?

In total: It looks like I have about 40k in debt (based on my credit report). About 38k is student loans, the other are medical bills, 1 odd 12 dollar charge, and 1 small comcast charge from 2007. All are with collectors.

I now make 95k/yr. My rent is 750/mo. I've got about 6k in savings. My credit card is completely paid off. I can bring in another 15-20k/yr doing consulting work on the side if I have to.

I can pay money, I just want to know the most effective way to pay. Who to pay, when to pay, etc. More importantly, is me fully repaying everything going to increase my credit score? Or is it just a waiting game at this point?

personalfinance,Currently not accumulating interest on student loan; should I be paying it down or saving for my final year + grad school?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I’m looking for some advice on handling my student loan... you guys always have amazing advice and I'm really unsure with this situation.

The loan: $20,863 held by the Canadian government at a floating interest rate of prime + 2.50%. Prime is currently 3.00%, but interest won’t start accumulating on my loan until I finish my degree in May 2015. No other debt.

I’m in the final year of my undergrad with just one semester of university left, which I’ll be starting in January. In the meantime, I’m currently on an 8-month co-op work term (May-Dec 2014).

Here’s the thing: thanks to co-op, for the first time ever, I have personal savings (about $3.2k) and a decent, steady income (roughly $2500/m) until January. I live alone (rent at $700/m, no transport expenses as I walk to work) and have zero financial support from my family while working or at school (living at home is a no-go). My expenses are otherwise minimal.

The terms of my loan would allow me to make early payments directly against the principal while still in school. However, I still have one more semester of school that I will have to pay for on my own, although I’m hoping for a scholarship to cover the tuition part (won’t know until August) and hoping to score a part-time paid research assistantship at the university for the spring (nothing guaranteed, but I worked there last year and they were very pleased with me). I’m also planning to go directly into grad school overseas in fall 2015 –hopefully with funding, but of course I can’t know that until application season.

Because Canada has a lifetime limit on how long you can keep interest-free status on a student loan and I’ll have spent six years on my undergrad degree (two years on co-op, one abroad), interest will start accumulating on my loan about halfway through the first year of my Masters degree (which is my terminal degree). I won’t have to make payments while I’m still in school, but the interest will be adding up the whole time.

Should I be using this opportunity to start making payments against the principal of my student loan balance? Or should I try to bolster my savings in anticipation of my last semester and Masters program instead? I’m going to feel pretty dumb if I pay back a big chunk of my loan only to have to borrow that money again if my scholarship/job/funding hopes fall through. And I’d rather have debt but some savings than no debt and no savings since I have no overdraft protection with the Bank of Mom &amp; Dad if you know what I mean...

What do you think, r/personalfinance? Am I being too risk-averse in hoarding my money as savings rather than paying down the principal of debt that’ll bite me in the ass partway through my Masters?",finance,1401746891

In 2011, I refinanced my private loan through Wells Fargo at 9% interest rate. At the time there was no competition to get a better interest rate so 1% seemed really refreshing to me.

While the minimum payment is $427, I've been paying $1000 every month toward that payment to try to pay it off as fast as possible. However, it gets really demoralizing knowing that I'm still paying 9% in interest to Wells Fargo that isn't paying the debt down.

I figured my credit has settled after the last refinance so I would look into refinancing again so I started private student loan consolidation places like Cedar Lending, SoFi, and ACS education. Now here's the bad news; When calling these places to try to apply for a loan, they refused service to me because I graduated Full Sail and not one of their preferred schools. I have graduated, have a steady job making 70k+ (not specific because coworkers are redditors), have a spotless credit history, and have been making payments reliably for my current loans so I am an incredibly safe investment.

It matures soon and its going to be about $70k USD. At this point in my life I have a pre-tax income of $39 to $44k, with benefits. The variation depends on my monthly bonuses, I usually get a bonus every month with a likely get a pay raise in the next few months. 

I'm 23 and I have about $20k  of student loans at 6.5% or so interest. Some are subsidized and are at 4.25% and 5.35%. I pay about $297 a month on these loans. These are unsubsidized loans from FAFSA. I started with roughly double that and after about a year of work I've cut it in half. I have no credit card or credit card debt. I have a rent of $875/month, my transport part of my employee benefits and I have been able to tax write off a lot of my expensive purchases like laptops, phones, tablets and such because they're work related. My living expenses vary but can get high because I'm in the NYC area but I'm generally pretty good about saving and have $5-7k stashed away. 

My dilemma is what I should do with $70k. Should I use it to pay off the student loans or would I be better off using my salary to gradually pay it off? My parents are suggesting that I use the money to buy a apartment or condo and rent to college students allowing me to pay off the mortgage and then have the option of living in it once is paid off. 

The other option they are offering is to put the $70k away for another 5 years at a rate of 4.5% which should net me a couple thousand dollars more. Of course that locks the money away for another 5 years so I would be 27 or 28 before I could use it again without risking losing the interest by breaking it early. Alternatively they said they can put it away for shorter terms of 1 year or 3 years for 2.5% and 3.8% respectively. 

I'm really not sure what I should do with it. I don't NEED the money right now and have no major foreseeable expenses, though the option of getting an apartment and renting it out is appealing. On the other hand should I pay off my remaining student loan amount and then put remaining principal away for another 5 years?

My question is, how can I, while paying these debts off, simultaneously increase my credit score. I've been paying monthly for the CC debts and since it's May the student loan sharks (most federal, some private student loans) have JUST started asking for a payment plan, so would it be possible to put them in deferment?

I think bankruptcy might be the answer :(","So... right after high school I took out a $35,000 private loan from Chase to pay for my school. My parents were unable to afford to send me to college, so naturally I chose an overpriced acting conservatory on the other side of the county, and decided to pay for it with a loan.
I thought the $10,000 merit scholarship that sponsored my housing was plenty of reason to take out a $35,000 private loan (with a 11% interest rate that is getting higher). My father also foolishly co-signed for this loan...

I did not finish school. I had to leave to take care of sick family members and I am no where near a finished degree.

Currently, I work multiple part time jobs. Two of these jobs are for non-profits, so my income is not great. Seriously like $10,000/yr.

My minimum payments on this loan are almost $600/mo. My pay is low and not regular (I am a theatre educator so I receive stipends every several months).

I have been deferring this loan for the past 5 years, and my deferment period has just expired (remember, this is a purely private loan).

I am not very financially informed, so I'm not sure what my options are exactly, but here are what *I* feel like my options are:

• Erase all progress i've made in my career field, and try to find an unrelated job that pays really well.

• File for bankruptcy.

The first option is very emotional because I have recently made a lot of strides in my career as a professional theatre artist. I have worked very to break into a career that is hard to break into.

The second option has potential to ruin my Father, who is my co-signer. He is almost 60 and i'm sure he doesn't want to keep working forever. He already filed bankruptcy 15+ years ago, as well.

So Apple being Apple will not just let any ole' crypto in to there circle of magic. And why you may ask? Its simple, Crypto is still viewed as a drug buying and scamming tool used by hackers. some think its just a fad. And others don't know what it is. crypto is a baby, and so was the internet once. It too was viewed and put down because of the lack of knowlage on the subject. but let me get to the point, Apple wants to look good! They don't want there product to be viewed as any of the things cryptos are thought to be.

Now here is why I think they will have doge allowed,


on http://coinmarketcap.com/ we are currently ranked 7th and have one of the largest sub for a coin, bigger than all but /r/bitcoin. Apple will only cater to big audiences and we ourselves are one.
We also have a lot of internet power as we have shown it in the last few months. Even at first if they don't accept up they are bound to sometime.

Our community is supportive and we rally around products and services that accept doge and help them along the way. Look at how some of these small in home companies have made a living now because they accept doge.

We have good PR, like the Dogecar, Olympic Bobsled, and Charities. We don't get anything negative reported about is in the news or other areas and if something does happen we help and fix the problem.

Apple want to look as good as they can because they are one of the largest tec companies in the world. Thats why bitcoin has been a delayed acceptance to them. They have the bad stigma and news, and unfortunately that shines among the other crypto too.

Im exited to see what happens in the next year or so. Thanks for reading this

Bitcoin,WSJ: Bitcoin's Futile Quest to Be a Currency,"By LAWRENCE PARKS
June 1, 2014 6:26 p.m. ET

Bitcoin is a fascinating and ingenious technology, but most promoters are mindful of neither the monetary nor the tax issues. For all practical purposes IRS regulations issued in March preclude bitcoins from being used as an alternative currency.

The IRS treats bitcoins as property. The result is that bitcoin transactions trigger a taxable event. Buyers incur a tax liability for the difference in dollars between what they paid for a bitcoin when they acquired it and the dollar value attributed to the bitcoin when they spend it. Sellers of course are subject to a tax based on the dollar value of the bitcoins they receive for a good or service.

To comply with these tax regulations, buyers and sellers must log all bitcoin transactions and report them at tax time. For transactions that require future payment, buyers and sellers undertake an exchange-rate risk involving the dollar value of bitcoins. This will greatly reduce, or perhaps eliminate entirely, using bitcoins for settling future payments, which is the principal use of money.

Some bitcoin zealots reject the effect of triggering taxable events on the theory that bitcoin transactions are anonymous. That is arguable. What is not arguable is that one who doesn't report a taxable bitcoin gain is guilty of tax fraud, which is a felony.

In other words, the future of bitcoins depends on users willing to log all transactions, report them at tax time, and pay a tax or to engage in tax fraud. As soon as one of them ends up in prison, that will be the end of it.

Why bitcoins to begin with? We already have a virtual currency, the dollar, which has the purported benefit of being the world's ""reserve currency.""

Some people see a problem because dollars can be created at the whim of the Federal Reserve, and as former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan once put it, ""without limit."" This depreciates the purchasing power of dollars saved or promised for future payment, such as pensions. At least the quantity of bitcoins is supposedly limited by the mathematical algorithm that creates them. As an interesting aside, the bitcoin folks call the creation process ""mining,"" an allusion to real money.

Bitcoin supporters understand that dollars are no longer money in the classical sense, i.e., something that has a unit of dimension defined in the physical world, as Sir Isaac Newton put it circa 1699 when he was England's Warden of the Mint. With neither debate nor anyone voting for it, the dollar has been transmogrified into an ethereal concept of money without any tie to the physical world, created out of nothing, and forced into circulation with legal tender laws.

As Australian comedian Michael Connell so brilliantly put it, what we used to call money has been transformed into ""the idea of money."" Mr. Connell's metaphor is that it's like playing musical chairs, but instead of chairs there is the ""idea of chairs."" It is absurd.

This brings to mind a related issue: U.S. Gold and Silver Eagles, which are legal tender for their face amounts under Title 31 of the United States Code. Yet as with bitcoins, the IRS arbitrarily treats these coins not as currency but as property, thereby preventing their use as money.

Consider: If you pay your taxes with a $50 Gold Eagle, you get credit for $50. No mystery there. However, if you spend a $50 Gold Eagle (or a $1 Silver Eagle), you trigger a taxable event on the difference between what you paid for the Gold Eagle and the market value of the gold in the coin when you spend it. Two recent cases challenging the IRS on this matter went up to the Supreme Court, but the court declined to hear the cases.

It is thanks to the IRS that no one uses so-called gold clauses, which would give creditors the right to demand Gold Eagles as payment in contracts. In other words, IRS policy that has no statutory authorization has rendered inoperative gold clause legislation passed by Congress in 1977.

Bitcoins have neither the advantage of being legal tender nor laws enabling their use. Folks who are accumulating bitcoins should take note.

My original plan was to get a ~500 dollar beater car to get me to and from work in the summer, and to school and around town/campus in the Fall/Spring. The money for this was to come out of some money I inherited a few years ago. That money is supposed to be for school, and as such I don't really want to touch it for this, but I need the car pretty soon and don't have $500 in-hand right now (was out of work for 2 1/2-3 weeks following the end of the semester, just started work again today).

I've had trouble finding cars in that price range, however, and any I have found also need $500 to $1,000 worth of work. Since coming to this conclusion I've started looking into small car loans, but from what I can find you can't really get a car loan for less than $5,000, and I really don't wanna and probably can't afford to spend that kinda money on a car right now. I assume that taking the $5k, putting 1-2k toward a car, and putting the rest right back toward the principal of the loan would probably result in some sort of early payment fee, so that probably isn't my best option. FWIW, I'm pretty sure I could get the $5k loan. The only thing going against my credit right now is a pretty decent amount of student loan debt ($50k, mostly federal loans). Besides that and only having ~5 years of credit history my credit is picture perfect, never missed a payment or been late on one or anything like that.

With that said I guess it's just nice to get direct feedback so I am asking directily.

I am 24 in the US. Financially I am meh, but I get by. I have two credit cards, one from college, the other about a year after. So about 3 or 2 years ago.. I've never had a late payment, and while I have had balances carry over, I have always made them a priority.

FEEL FREE TO SKIP TO THIS PART..
So I went to college in Long Isalnd, New York and lived in a house with some friends. My final year the electric bill was in my name. When I graduated in 2011 I moved out and returned to New Jersey, my home state. Since a month ago I have not heard a word from anybody. As far as I knew, I settled the account when I left, and passed it on when a friend of mine moved in and assumed the utilities of the house with his own account.

Last month, I started getting phone calls from an unknown number. I am always suspicious of these, I worked in telemarketing, and if I pick up I usually just say ""Please Do Not Call, DNC me."" After a few weeks I get fed up and call the number and nothing happens. I call again a few days later and it's a collection agency and after I give them my info they claim I owe $156.00. I didn't admit to owing it, I said don't call me with that, that should be settled from years ago, just mail me any information. I gave them my address and they send me a bill. Its asking for a check to the collections agency for the money on behalf of LIPA, the old power company.

Other info.. LIPA was bought out not too long ago, and is now owned by PSE&amp;G. I couldn't sign onto LIPA online, to see if they had any information because my info doesn't work from PSE&amp;G. I haven't heard from them since I left, no forwarded mail, no phones calls, nothing for the year after from my friend who lived in the house after me. 

Is it possible I owe them money? I guess. I walked away and haven't thought about it, I can't remember walking away from that kind of thing, I am otherwise clean with bills and payments. I am not the best with my finances as far as looking into my credit score and my usage. I am now learning thanks to this reddit. I am just a dumb Jersey Italian.  I got a free report shortly after college and it was clean. Now, it says I have a passed due thing, I'm assuming related to this.

General hitsory of Litecoin:

Litecoin is a decentralized online peer to peer currency created in October 2011 by Charles Lee, a former Google employee.

Litecoin is headed by a world class development team led by Warren Togami who founded the Fedora Linux project.

The developers are constantly improving Litecoin and adding new features to make it a better experience for you.

There will only ever be 84 million Litecoins, so you don't have to worry about inflation decreasing the value of your Litecoins in the future. 

Litecoin has a stable, established marketplace consisting of many exchanges that handle tens of millions of dollars in Litecoin trade every day.

Litecoin works using secure software that runs on your computer and allows you to make payments as easily as sending an email.

You can store them securely on your computer as well as your mobile device.

With Litecoin you can send money anywhere in the world, to anyone, instantly.
The transaction fees are considerably less than those charged by major credit card companies, traditional bank transfers--and even other digital payment processors. 

Litecoin also provides a safe and easy way for merchants to accept money as there are no fees to receive payments and no chargebacks, ever.
All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, known as the Blockchain so payments can be immediately verified. 

For example, a business in Singapore can receive payment from a customer in Mexico City as quickly as sending an email, and both parties have clear proof that the payment was sent and received.

The possibilities are endless.  Welcome to the future of commerce.  Welcome to Litecoin.

personalfinance,Better to save or pay off debt?,"I am a professional in my early 30's who is about to have a considerable boost to my finances and want to figure out the best way to handle the funds.

For the past 16 months, I have been barely keeping my head above water.  I get paid bi-weekly and my take home from each check is $2,096.  I live around D.C. so the cost of living is extremely high.  My monthly rent is $1,450, my water/trash/etc usually runs around $75, I have two credit cards, one that I pay $100 a month on and one that I pay approximately $220, my cable is approximately $130/month, I have a car payment of $561, my car insurance is $60, and I have two student loan payments for $300 and $660 respectively.  All told, that should come to $3,556.  For the vast majority of months when I only receive 2 paychecks, it has been a very tight squeeze to make the left over $636 work in regards to food/gas/toiletries/etc.  During this entire time, I have been working a ton with the knowledge that the revenue I create at work would have a direct impact on my income and thankfully I have been successful and that will vest next month.  

I will receive a bonus that is paid out in equal amounts by July 30th and August 30th.  This bonus should be approximately $48k total, which at a 40% tax rate will leave me with $28k.  My salary will also be brought in line with my bonus starting July 1st.  My first paycheck thereafter is July 4th so that should see a little bit of a bump, and then from July 18th forward my new take home per paycheck should be right around $3,185.  

Most of my bonus money is already spoken for.  For instance, I will have approximately $10k left on my car loan when I receive my bonus and I am going to use the loan to pay that off as that will mean a significant amount less in expenses per month.  I also am going to give some money to my assistants to reward them, buy some personal things that I view as a necessity at this point (new mattress, replace decades old hand me down furniture), buy new clothes as I haven't done it in 3-4 years, pay off overdue car tax, etc.  When done, realistically I might have $3-$4k in bonus leftover, but not much.

I do not have any savings to speak of.  After paying my past due debts and my car off, I anticipate most months having net income of $6,370 and bills of $2,995, leaving me with $3,375 for everything else.  I say most months because I get paid every two weeks so in August I'll have an extra paycheck and next January I'll have an extra paycheck.   This is obviously a significant change from the $636 I've been living on for awhile now.  

My goals are three fold.  I want to pay off my credit card debt.  I want to make bigger payments on my student loans (if smart financially), and I don't want to spend all my money every month doing those things so that I can actually go out and have a nice dinner, or happy hour with friends, or go on a date, or go shopping, without having to worry about my bank account balance.  Once I pay off the credit cards, my new third goal would be to start saving some money.

My credit card balances currently are approximately $12,000.  If I have money left over from my bonus, it will go to paying these off.  I hope to then put about $1,500 per month on the cards until they are paid.  I also plan on putting my entire extra paycheck in August towards my credit cards.  Even if no bonus money is left over, that should mean I can pay off my credit card debt in 6 months.  That will again lessen my expenses and erase some bad debt and I will be left with $3,695 per month in take home that is not immediately devoted to living expenses or debt.

When I get to that point in the next year, should I start saving or should I focus on paying off student loans?  I am one of those folks you hear about with large student loans that total about $166k.  $115k of that is at 5.25% interest and the other $51k is 3.5%.  Further, although the $51k is at a lower interest rate, my parents are co-signers on those loans so a part of me would really like to pay those before the higher interest rate amount.  Ideally, I'd keep around $500/week - $2k a month - of my take home for food/gas/shopping/etc.  That would leave me with $1,700 approximately a month to either service student loan debt or save.

Is one automatically better than the other?  Am I so wrong in my thinking on some of these topics and what debts to pay first that I need to readjust?  One place I can see that might need readjusting is paying the credit cards because they're higher rates before the car.  I run into a roadblock there however because paying the car frees up more money for me on a monthly basis than paying the credit cards.

I've also heard about needing to save up a 6 month emergency fund in case things go wrong at my job/etc.  Should I do that before I start trying to make extra payments on my student loans?  

Thanks for any help.  Trying to make sure now that I will have a little money that I both pay off debt from the past and look towards the future in the best way possible.",finance,1401801528

personalfinance,"Sanity Check - 25yo - 1 year into student loan aggressive payoff, is my strategy dumb?","Hi all, long time subscriber to this subreddit. Throwaway since I am posting more info than I would usually be comfortable with.

I'm 25, 3 years out of school, graduated with approximately 71k of student loan debt. I got sick of not making any progress on my loans, so last year after I got a pretty nice salary increase I decided to really start kicking ass on them. As of today I'm below 54k on student loans. I have 2ish month's expenses in savings, and an old 401k with about 4k on it that I'm thinking about rolling over, or just cashing out and throwing at my car note. I do not currently contribute to any retirement accounts.

33k private -4.75% variable.
21k federal -5.6%ish average fixed
6k - auto - 6.9% (car is worth more than what I owe)

Right now I'm throwing $1000/month at the private loans (3x min), $400 at the federal ones (1.5x min), and $250 at my car loan (1.05x min).

My goal is to be debt free by the time I'm 30, assuming I continue to make what I'm making now (69k). Any raises (if they ever happen) / bonuses (heh) / extra is going straight to student loans. I've refinanced the private loans down to their current rate, and that payment plan above will get me pretty close. I'm making decent money, but given my other living expenses and other unforeseen expenses that seem to happen every month (I live in a large city) I will pretty much have to live paycheck to paycheck for the next 3+ years until the debt is gone. I'm throwing as much as I'm comfortable with at the private loans because I foresee a large rise in interest rates and the federal balance has a variable rate, which could very quickly and easily approach 10%.

If you haven't guessed, this debt has made me extremely cynical about life and the world we live in and I want it gone.

Am I dumb for just trying to kill off as much of this debt as I can as fast as possible? I can't imagine I could do better than 4% in the markets given that they are at all time highs and due for a correction in the next few years when interest rates start rising, and money spent avoiding interest is money earned as far as I'm concerned. Once the debt is paid off I'll start following ""the rules"" (max 401k, max IRA, etc...)

personalfinance,Am I doing the right thing? (Pay Debt vs. Save for retirement),"Hi all, I wanted to get some advice regarding the financial implications of some life changes that are in the
works in the near future for my family.  I had been thinking that everything was prettymuch in a good place,
but now i'm having second thoughts about my plan.  My wife and I are 30 &amp; 33 years old, and we're expecting
our first child in 5 months. Here is a rundown of our current setup.

----

***Income***

**Combined income**: $120k pretax.

----

***Debts***

**My student loans** (currently in school, but will graduate in 9 months with these)

**Loan 1**: $15k @ 1.9% (private, fixed)

**Loan 2**: $19k @ 6.8% (federal, fixed)


**Wife's student loan**

**Loan 1**: $52k @ 6.0% (federal, fixed)

We currently pay $360 toward her loan (this is the minimum on her 30 year plan) and $640/mo toward my 6.8% loan. No payment required for mine yet, but it is accruing interest.  Our plan of $1k/mo toward student  loans starting with highest interest first would have them completely paid off by 2022 or so.

----

***Retirement investments***

$50,000 - We both contribute 15% to our respective 401ks but have had a late start. My 401k matches 3%, wife's is 5%.

----

***Savings***

$23,000 in savings account for Home down payment

$11,000 in mutual fund for home down payment

$10,000 emergency fund

$1,500 car savings (for next vehicle)

----

***Expenses***

Rent: $1,300 (great deal on 1 BR apt in high cost of living city)

Student loans: $1,000

Dining: $400

Groceries: $200

Auto/Transp: $250

Sprint: $82 x 2

Power: $73

Gym: $30 x 2

Internet: $59

We save the leftover money to the Home and Car accounts, usually between $1,500/mo and $2,000/mo.

----

Our plan: While we are fine with our 1BR apt while the baby is small, we'd like more space fairly soon. We also will be seeing a new expense of $1,500/mo (if we're lucky, we found a good deal) on daycare starting this winter.

I will be graduating with an MBA next spring.  We would then like to move to a lower cost-of-living area, and still both of us would have jobs, ideally.  Our plan is to rent a larger place for 1 year after we move, and 
then buy, using savings for 20% down payment.

I'd like input about our rate of debt repayment, specifically.  I am torn between feeling behind on retirement savings and feeling like we should pay down the loans faster.  As you may gather from the numbers above, I'm pretty conservative, and like to have a large amount of cash on hand, especially in today's economy.

The main argument against inflation seemed to be that the Fed paying interest on excess reserves at the short-term market rate would stop the money multiplier effect, since there would no longer be an opportunity cost of holding excess reserves with the Fed.  [Per this Fed research article:](http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr380.pdf)

&gt; When reserves earn interest, the multiplier process described above stops sooner. Instead of continuing to the point where the market interest rate is zero, the process will now stop when the market interest rate reaches the rate paid by the central bank on reserves. If the central bank pays interest on reserves at its target interest rate, as we assumed in our example above, the money multiplier completely disappears. In this case, banks never face an opportunity cost of holding reserves and, therefore, the multiplier process described above does not even start.

Do the banks have any restrictions absent capital and reserve requirements on what they can do with that reserve cash?  Once those requirements are met, which doesn't appear difficult seeing how they are flush with reserve cash, there seems to be a huge incentive for the banks to use as much of that reserve cash as possible to buy instruments that yield higher than the rate paid by the Fed on their excess reserves, as long as they continue meeting their new capital and reserve requirements along the way (and adjust for the added risk).  If I'm correct in that sub-conclusion, wouldn't that mean there is still an opportunity cost for some of those excess reserve holdings, which would explain the apparently unlimited demand for bonds?  Wouldn't this in turn incentivize companies (either through banks pressuring them or just leaping at too-good-to-be-true rates) to take on more and more debt at artificially low rates, giving them a lot of extra cash to spend in the economy?  And finally, wouldn't this be inflationary?",finance,1401818715
dogecoin,[Serious] Let's talk about something big: taxes.,"I think we need to have a serious discussion over federal governments claiming taxes on Dogecoin holders.

Recently over at /r/BitcoinMarkets, someone posed the question of **capital gains tax**. This would be money earned from investing in Bitcoin. One user responded with this lengthy explanation. There are a lot of people in Dogecoin that don't understand taxes to this degree, one of them being myself.

What do you all think?

From /u/bitcointaxes

[Permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/27574p/do_i_have_to_list_btc_trading_profits_as_income/chxlftw)

Profits from Bitcoin (or any crypto-currencies) are called Capital Gains. This just means income made from your capital, i.e. your initial investment. If you have ever bought any stocks or shares, it is pretty much the same thing.

A few things are important:

There is no tax liability for just buying and owning Bitcoin. There is nothing declare and no taxes to pay. But you do need to keep a record of what you bought, and when, for later.

Tax events are triggered, when you trade your Bitcoin back to USD (or other currency), buying altcoins (opinions differ, see below) or spend them. At this point you have to work out the gains you made, which is the proceeds you received less the original cost (less any fees). That will be included in your Schedule D, Form 8949 when you file your 2014 taxes.

It is a good idea to put aside the taxes you owe now so you don't have a shock next year.

There is no deduction or threshold for capital gains. Everything should be included.

(except: because of the way rounding works on the tax forms, gains for any transaction that are less than $0.50 become zero, and so can be ignored)

The amount of taxes you pay may vary depending on your circumstances.

Gains are split into ""long-term"" and ""short-term"", essentially it is long-term if you owed the Bitcoin for more than a year when you realized gains. Long-term taxes are discounted in the US, and are a 0% rate for lower income earners. Because of this, as a student you will likely have no taxes to pay IF you owned the coins for more than a year.

Short-term gains are taxed as income. You have to declare it on your tax form and it is added to anything else you have earned. You tax rate and amount you pay then just depends on how much income you made overall.

What is complicated is working out what that Bitcoin cost you and so how much gains you made when you spent it. Most people don't buy 1 BTC then spend that 1 BTC. You buy various amounts and sell or spend varying amounts. It's a lot easier if you only use Coinbase, for instance, to buy/sell and spend, because you can just see your whole cost and gains. However, if you spend elsewhere or trade elsewhere, or bought altcoins, this must be included.

I mention the tax event for trading altcoins. This is one item the IRS has not yet cleared up. All crypto-coins are considered personal property, and all property trades incur capital gains. However there is an exception in real-estate because it is considered ""like-kind"". Some tax professional believe this would also apply to crypto-currencies, some don't, or think you should be prudent and declare them and pay taxes to ensure you do not underpay taxes. This decision is between you and your tax professional.

There is more information on our site https://bitcointaxes.info, which also works out capital gains and taxes.",cryptocurrency,1401819940

personalfinance,"$90k in fed student loans, IBR right now...what's the next step? Unpaid internship, Peace Corps, staying at home?","Yes, throwaway, because I'm hitting dead ends everywhere, and I would appreciate any advice as this subreddit has been beyond helpful. I know this might be lengthy, so bare with me.

Recent law school grad (2013), with $90k in fed loans (some sub, some unsub). I applied for IBR when my payments kicked in 11/2013 as I had no employment, thus no income. I was then and still am on a staffing agency, but getting called into a project hasn't been consistent. I worked for a bit from November-January, but it stopped after that. I joined another staffing agency in February with no results.

At this point, I have placed my resume to over 400 places. Most law firms aren't hiring. My dream job is to work with public policy/humanitarian affairs, so I've looked around in that field as well. The same nonprofits and organizations that have told me to get more experience and a master's degree are rejecting me me this time again. In addition, I've looked for everything (Monster, Indeed, etc.) for basic entry-level positions, but I keep getting rejected for being overqualified. I even went to restaurants (Red Lobster, Pizza Hut) and retail stores in the mall (Abercrombie, Limited, NY &amp; Co, Macy's, you name it), and I never even received a call following up submitting my resume. Last week, I found a position, and I am currently working for a religious charity, as a part-time volunteer legal intern. I know there is no upward mobility, but it's something to put on the resume.

I've been battling what's good for now vs. what's good for the resume. I'm living with my parents, and besides the school loans, I have no debt. I seldomly use my credit cards unless for emergency and my car is paid off. My parents have been wonderful in letting me stay without rent, and I fully intend to pay them back when I have a steady stream of income. I also help them around the house (as any good kid would) and run errands for them.

Right now, my savings is around $4,000. I started to sell my old belongings, clothes, books, etc. for some immediate cash on Craigslist and flea markets, but I know it's not sustainable after I've sold everything. Also, I don't live in a particularly thriving area (I live in Western Maryland, near the WV/PA border).

I recently networked with someone who threw out the suggestion of interning at this organization, who often hires their interns as full time employees. Although it's not guaranteed, it's a big legal organization based in DC, and my colleague is currently working there (and can be a reference). Of course, this requires me moving to DC and being unpaid for duration. I know I can't afford it, but the whole getting experience vs. not digging the hole any further is putting me at a crossroads.

I've already been a year out of graduation, so I know there's more competition. I plan to still seek work, any of kind of work that will provide for immediate income. Here are my questions.

* Am I making a mistake applying for entry level jobs? In addition, should I take out my legal education on my resume so it doesn't seem like I'm overqualified?
* Should I take out a loan, make the move to DC, hoping for something? Ugh, that sounds horrible as I write that.
* I know I'm a grown ass person living in their parents (and grateful for it), but it this okay for the time being...however long that is?
* As for IBR loans, I'm daunted at what my taxed income would be after 25 years, but I'm grateful that I don't have to payment anything right now. But I do want to make payments. I'm afraid that if I get a job (seems like 30-35k have been my target area...much lower than law school grads, but I'm willing to take anything), I'm not sure how much to allocate towards savings and putting the rest towards loans (IBR payment + more). Do you advocate for always putting the bare minimum on IBR or should I double up on IBR payments (when I qualify for IBR)?
* I have several friends in Peace Corps who have landed jobs. I originally wanted to do Peace Corps, but I was silly and thought a job would land me with a JD. I'm more than willing to do Peace Corps for the experience and if possible, boost in employment. I know it's not easy, and if I want to go home early, I'd feel like a failure. I was hoping Peace Corps would change my ""law school will give you a job"" mentality and outlook altogether with my background in international affairs. I also wouldn't have to pay for loans during my service, either.

My goals basically are to be independent (and I can live frugally--I still have all my items that I lived when I was in grad school in storage, it's just getting a job and finding an apartment) and pay off my loans.

And for people who question my decision to enter law school, I honestly thought a JD would get me somewhere, especially when I get keeping rejections from jobs for needed a master's degree (I was an international studies/human rights major in undergrad). I had steady summer employment at the firms I was working at, but they aren't hiring (but very helpful with references). I've already felt bad that my degree seems useless, and I often think about what if I would have done something different. Which is why I want your suggestions and advice, knowing that I could do something different now that could help me.

I apologize again for being lengthy. But thank you in advance. I'm all ears (throw me your criticism), I just want to know what's the next step.

Edit: Thank you for all your kind words. They are definitely encouraging and will take each day as it comes. I'll continue applying and see where it comes from there. I haven't made any decisions, but I hope to look for Fall internships.

One year ago:

* Salary: $61/yr
* 401K: $4,042.65 (Contributing 1%)
* Savings: $3,000
* Mortgage: $1,515/mo (includes taxes, HOA, insurace, etc..)


Here was the post I made roughly a year ago (on my old account, obviously):
http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1h9n1w/help_me_get_to_fi_in_the_next_7_years/


Looking at my original post, my goal of being FI in 7 years was very ambitious.  Regardless, I do like the direction I'm heading in right now.  My goal was to rent out my condo for $1,700.  I rented it out for $1,550.  My goal was to find a place for around $1,000 - $1,200 to live in.  I'm currently living with my parents until August, and then I'll be moving in with my girlfriend where I won't be paying rent, but will be paying at least $450 for our living expenses (groceries, dining out, etc..).  Haven't calculated what my living expenses were last year and not sure what they will be this year, but I am moving from the most expensive part of the city to a much more reasonably priced part of the city.


My condo won't officially be rented out until next month, so, even though I'm living at home, I've still had to pay the mortgage.  Starting next month, I'll be able to make significant contributions to my savings.  My next step is to contribute the full amount ($17,500/yr) to my 401K.  I'm still unsure of what to do beyond that.  I'd like to buy another property, but I don't see that happening until summer 2016 at the earliest.  I don't feel comfortable enough having two mortgage payments over my head.  Once I see how my current condo performs, I may consider it in the future.  In the meantime, I'll look into buying some index funds or something.  I'll only have this awesome $450/mo living situation for about a month and then the girlfriend and I will probably be moving from Dallas to Austin.  Looking forward to it very much, but definitely means there will be an increase in living expenses.  There is also, I believe, opportunity for great real estate investing, so maybe after living there a year, if I'm in a good place financially, I'll invest it another property there.  Either that, or I'd like to look into investing in a rental house near the UTD campus in Dallas.  It's a small, but rapidly growing, college in a city that is booming.


Anyway, I know I am still a long ways away from being FI, but just wanted to share my progress in the last year and thank everyone here for their help.  I hope next year I'll be able to report back with even better results.


EDIT:  A couple notes:

- My employer doesn't match my 401K earnings until the end of the year, so once 2015 starts, the amount I have in there should jump significantly

* $75/mo out of the $1,515 mortgage is part of a special assessment for the condo. They've redone a lot of the building and it costs each condo owner a total of $5,000. I chose to pay it out over 5 years with a 2% interest rate (I believe), so that adds $75/mo to my HOA. That amount will be gone in 4 years (or sooner if I decide to pay off the amount, which I could very well do in the near future).",finance,1401829266

personalfinance,Several questions before buying first home,"I've been researching the home buying process, and wanted to clarify a few things to get oriented in the right direction. I'm looking to buy a ~$200k house to last me 5-10 years. 

- I won't have a huge down-payment ($10k) in order to avoid depleting my emergency fund. I've been looking towards FHA, but I'm wary of PMI.  I'm eligible to join Navy Federal, which has 100% financing with no PMI, but has fairly high interest rates for this option. NFCU's brief on PMI for FHA does not provide specific details - would it be less than through a typical lender, or is PMI rate common for all FHA loans? 

- Follow up: quick online estimates suggest mortgage payments for FHA with PMI/lower interest rate and 100% financing without PMI/higher interest rate would be comparable; at that point, are there any additional benefits worth noting of one versus the other?

- I'm currently a member at a major US bank; would switching banks completely (to NFCU) or opening a second account negatively affect my credit heading into obtaining a mortgage? I've seen mixed opinions on this.

- APR/interest rate: FHA loan has a minimum 3.5% interest rate, 5.149% APR, while 100% financing has 5.125% interest rate, 5.443% APR. When comparing APRs, FHA isn't as impressive as interest rate solely. When using online mortgage estimators, would the APR be the appropriate ""interest rate"" for a more accurate monthly estimate?

I'm very new to this and hoping to not screw up too badly. Any additional guidance to these questions that you're willing to share would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1401833876
Bitcoin,"Putting the Apple ""virtual currencies"" announcement into strategic perspective","Hello, everyone.  I am new in this community so I don't expect too much attention, however, I'd like to bring an idea to yours.  Some of the following is *speculation* -- I expect time to be the judge of it.

As much as I admire Apple for having shaken up the computer industry and generally improved computers for human beings, I feel compelled to note that the celebration going on here may be vastly overblown.

Yes, we now know that Apple policy for App Store apps has changed to allow virtual currencies.  Now read the provision right next to it:

&gt; provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions

You know what that means for you, app developer and app user?

You see, merely providing an app that does Bitcoin transfers *without snitching on your users* could cause at least *someone* (usually wearing a black dress and a wig) to proclaim that the app ""facilitates money laundering""... with the corollary that he will order the app developer (or the app store) punished.  An app that provides a wallet but furnishes no way to associate a legal identity to a balance or address could probably trigger the same aggression.  Any app that does anything beyond transfers, such as asset trading, yet doesn't snitch your trades to strangers behind your back, is most certainly going to befall the same fate.

Since *Apple is not in the business of testing legal theories* (a.k.a. endangering their business in front of a man in a dress with the power to shut the business down) *on behalf of App Store developers*, you can probably conclude Apple will err in the side of chickenshit ""caution"", and you can probably make the reasonable guess that they *won't* approve any app from a developer, unless the developer can prove to Apple that their app's functionality is crippled to fit the box that is ""the law"", or the activity of their userbase can be utterly surveiled.

In other words: unless you have tens of millions of dollars in the bank and another couple million sunk into lawyers, ""regulation"" and ""compliance"" (really, *obedience payola*), then *your app will never see approval*.  That's right: Coinbase and BitPay *may* be able to get *their* apps -- fundamentally, PayPal clones -- into the App Store, but an app-done-by-Satoshi-Nakamoto-himself *will not*.

In other words: the innovation that characterizes Bitcoin and its ecosystem is not going to be allowed within the walled garden of Apple.  Multisig, escrow, asset trading, programmable money, these and future cryptocurrency developments defy the ""regulations"" and are therefore contrary to the App Store policies.  Congratulations, the App Store's policies have been *effectively left unchanged*: you can now submit PayPal clones, only this time these clones allow you to send and receive ""funny money"" too!

For all intents and purposes, trying to do something cryptocurrency and really innovative while targeting the Apple platform is a dead-end, a thing that will never happen, a thing you should not wait for or support.  The App Store is *incompatible* with the principles of pseudonymous, private, free, unimpeded, two-party transactions that are unquestionably *embodied by Bitcoin*.

This phenomenon of ""prior censorship"" is what characterizes any marketplace so tied by ""regulations"" that anything which may defy these threats could cause the marketplace to be sued into disappearance.  It's why Bitcoin was engineered to be decentralized to begin with.  It's why closed (software / social / economic) ecosystems can't evolve past their original limitations.  It's why you should probably not target the App Store for your development efforts.

Could be worse, though.  For example, should the Apple App Store *command the behavior* of a significant portion of future Bitcoin users, then the App Store will be *the* thing that impedes / retards /  progress and innovation.

Keep this thought next to your cautious optimism about the App Store ""allowing cryptos"".",cryptocurrency,1401834174

Bitcoin,"I am a tax attorney, here is why you should strongly consider filing an FBAR by the June 30th deadline if you had an account at MtGox prior to its collapse (US taxpayers only).","Hey Guys,

I know that many people in the bitcoin community don't really care about complying with US reporting requirements.  While I generally don't recommend that course of action, I especially urge you to reconsider if you had an account at MtGox prior to its collapse.   That's because MtGox is no longer in a position to safeguard your confidentiality (if it ever was in the first place).   The US has been ruthless in recent years in chasing down US taxpayers with undisclosed foreign accounts, and bitcoin holders are not likely to catch any breaks.  The US Attorney's office has already issued a subpoena to MtGox for it's records, and given that Japan already cooperates with US account holder disclosure initiatives, I find it unlikely that the subpoena will go unenforced.  Additionally, many large bitcoin holders have joined the class action lawsuit against MtGox/Karpeles for their lost coins, or at the very least filed a claim with the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee.  These are tacit admissions in open court of your prior bitcoin holdings.  It would take almost no effort on the part of the US Justice Department to obtain and cross-check these records.  So, those with qualifying account balances at MtGox prior to it's collapse should strong consider filing an FBAR by the June 30th deadline.     

Before anyone says it, I am not trying to spread FUD.  I care about this community and do not want to see any of you go to prison or pay outrageous fines that can easily wipe out your bitcoin holdings (and then some).   To say the US Government has been ruthless when it comes to FBAR non-filers is an understatement.   The MtGox fiasco provides a perfect opportunity for the government to crackdown on the wide spread non-compliance among the bitcoin community.  I wouldn't bet against it.

**************************
Here is some additional information for those who want to know more: 
**************************

**How do I know if I need to file an FBAR?**   The FBAR requirement applies if you have more than $10,000 in foreign accounts at any given time during the year.  This test looks at the total of *all your foreign accounts*, not just MtGox.  So, you're technically required to look at the daily account balance of the BTC and USD in *all* your foreign financial accounts and add them up.  If the total exceeds $10,000 on any given day, then you are supposed to disclose *each account* on the FBAR form (even if the individual accounts are less than $10,000).  Now, I'm sure many will consider disclosing just their MtGox accounts and leaving off other foreign bitcoin accounts, but recognize that your FBAR in this case would be false and you could be subject to additional criminal prosecution.  More information on FBAR filings are available on the [[IRS website](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Report-of-Foreign-Bank-and-Financial-Accounts-FBAR)]   


**What are the penalties for failing to file an FBAR?** The penalty for failure to file an FBAR starts out at $10,000 for non-willful violations.  If your failure was willful, the penalty is the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the highest account balance for each account per year. Criminal prosecution is also known to occur.

Willfulness is defined generally as the intentional disregard of a known legal duty. The IRS will typically asserts willfulness if you fail to file FBARs in multiple years. Otherwise, the determination will depend on your knowledge, sophistication, and experience as an investor.


**How do I file the form?** The FBAR form is actually called FinCEN Form 114 and is e-filed with FinCEN.  Here is the[ link](http://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/main.html).  Note that you will also have to amend your 2013 tax return to check the disclosure box on line 7a of Schedule B.  *You should also add any unreported income while you're at it, see below*. 

**Which bitcoin exchanges are ""foreign?""**  Most bitcoin exchanges to my knowledge are foreign.  MtGox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, BTC-China, BitFinex, and OKcoin are just a few that come to mind.  You'll have to do some research if your account is with a different bitcoin exchange.  One redditor suggested in the comments that [http://bitcoinx.io](http://bitcoinx.io) provides the country information of various bitcoin exchanges. 

**What if my MtGox account was worth more than $10,000 for just one day?**  That's all it takes, one-day is enough.  You need to file. 

**What if I can't access my MtGox records?**  Many former MtGox account holders may find that their records are unavailable.  If you are certain that your account balance exceeded $10,000 even without being able to look at your prior records, then I suggest you make a good-faith estimate of your highest account balance.  Although guessing is not ideal, it is all you can do under the circumstances and filing your best-guess is better than not filing at all.  

**Is my paper wallet a ""foreign account?""**  Probably not. It's pretty difficult to imagine that a paper wallet containing would qualify as a “financial account” held at “foreign financial institution”.  

**Is my blockchain.info or similar online wallet a ""foreign account?""** These are probably not subject to the reporting requirements either, although it depends on the nature of your account. The most important factor is whether you give custody of your bitcoins to the e-wallet provider.  If you do, then your e-wallet is likely subject to the reporting requirements.

On the other hand, if you maintain control of the e-wallet and the provider has no access to your bitcoins, then it’s unlikely your e-wallet is a “financial account.” Without a financial account, you cannot be subject to the reporting requirements.

A simple test is to check if you are given a personal key for the wallet. Most custodial e-wallets do not provide you with a personal key, meaning that you must request a transfer of your bitcoin, which they then execute on your behalf.  A noncustodial e-wallet, on the other hand, gives you the personal key and you can transfer bitcoins out of the wallet without any interaction with the e-wallet provider. They have no access to your bitcoins and essentially just generate a valid wallet address for you without keeping any control over your account. Therefore, it would be unlikely that they are maintaining an account on your behalf.

**What if I need to file an FBAR for 2012 also?**  Since the value of bitcoins was much lower in 2012, this is not a problem for most people.  However, if you were over the $10,000 minimum in 2012 (or earlier) and did not file an FBAR, I suggest you talk to a tax attorney about your next step.   Late FBARs implicate some very serious penalties, and it would be wise to consider all of your options with a knowledgeable attorney before choosing the best course of action.  

**What if I didn't report the income from my MtGox account (and/or other bitcoin exchange accounts)?**  You're going to need to amend your returns to include the missing gains, in addition to filing the FBAR forms.  If you situation extends back to 2012 or earlier, I suggest you discuss the matter with a tax attorney.  Unreported income and missing FBARs for multiple years can trigger criminal prosecution.  

***************************************************
**Conclusion**
***************************************************
FBARs are tricky business and the stakes are exceptionally high.   If you are in doubt about your situation, I strongly suggest you contact a tax attorney to discuss your options, particular if your case involves multiple years of missing FBARs with unreported income.  Also, this post does not discuss Form 8938, which is an additional foreign disclosure requirement for higher balance accounts and was due April 15th.

personalfinance,In the process of building credit for a bigger goal. What should be my next move?,"A little backstory here.

Last year I turned 30 and pretty much became fed up with where I was in life both professionally and financially. I realized that because of my limited traditional schooling (never finished community college) I would only have so many options available especially given the place that I am. 

On the flipside for the last 5 years I've been building up skills that are more suited for media (Shooting and editing video, and other parts of filmmaking. etc) none of those things translates into immediate jobs in my area. I realize that I will need to move in order to make something happen but that's another discussion for another time.


The point of my post is that I want to have some sort of control over my income. basically I want to take my skills and go into business for myself. The problem is I have the business plan but I need the capital. If I try to go it alone  I'll end up working for another 5 years in the same mundane position or similar positions while I save up money to get one project off the ground... The upside to that is If I fail, I fail with possibly little to no debt... but the downside is that I'll be probably in the same position I'm in now... so.. I'm coming here for the next logical step.


on to my questions...


Originally, I thought about building credit for a couple of years then trying to get a loan, but even with good credit I'm not 100% convinced that's the wisest option but I am on a path to build credit anyway for other reasons. last year i purchased a newer used car. I'm currently a month ahead on my payments. Recently I saw that I was approved for a ""bill me later"" paypal account with a $500 credit limit (a few months ago I was denied by these guys because I had no credit history) 


I've heard from several sources that I should have 3 sources of credit so that banks/companies can get an idea of me. So, if you include paypal and my car payments each as sources of credit... What should be my 3rd line? 


Also, is my plan for getting a starting loan a viable one? what are some alternatives?",finance,1401837857

personalfinance,Am I calculating this correctly? Retirement amount needed and how to get there. The simple version.,"Help me with my thinking on this - am I doing it right?

I want to figure out how much we need to retire and I want to use the technique basing it on my assumed expenses (rather than ""70% of my current salary"" or whatever). 

I figure we would need about 40,000 a year (in today's dollars) to cover our costs each year in retirement beginning in 2037. So I used an inflation calculator to figure that would be roughly 80,000 a year in 2037 dollars. We have 2 different pensions and our estimated SS would give us about 35,000/year (I assumed conservatively on SS)- this brings my needs to 45,000/yr (in 2037 dollars). 

Summary: 80,000 a year in expenses (2037 dollars) minus 35,000 a year in SS/pension = 45,000/year we withdraw from the nest egg.

I multiply 45,000 by 25 to get 1,126,00 needed for my next egg.


Now - how to save that amount?
We currently have 167,000 in various non taxed savings vehicles.
We save 9,000 a year. (I also put more in my work based pension plan - I'm leaving that out for ease of calculation. This would ultimately factor in my above calculation for how much I need a year...decreasing it. But I'm keeping things conservative, also thinking about changing jobs).

I used an online calculator that took that base amount 167,000 + 9,000 a year savings (increase savings yearly by 1%), 6% interest rate (being conservative), no taxes on this growing nest egg until withdrawal.  

It says I would have 1,126,000 in 23 years. 

According to this plan - we can hit our goal sticking with status quo.

Does this seem right? I realize that so much of this is based on what I assume we can live on during retirement (not to mention unforeseen circumstances such as illness etc),  but is my basic thinking sound?",finance,1401846778

Neither of them graduated college and only my father works. So suffice to say, I have and will be paying for essentially everything in my life. 

My main concern is college debt and eventually a retirement fund. My desired career is a being a general surgeon. This will require ALOT of college and along side that ALOT of money. I have hedged my bets already, in May 2015 along side my HS diploma I will be earning my AA degree in general studies from a local community college. Even with my first 2 years covered, I'll still have 2 years of regular college and hopefully 4 more years of medical school to pay for. All of it I will have to pay myself.

What I wish to achieve is Financial Independence at an early age and work not because I have to but because I want to. A mighty task, sure, but I believe it is a possible especially with the job career I have chosen to pursue. One might say worrying about FI at my age is stupid but I would have to disagree completely. I understand the power of my youth, it has the potential to ease the rest of my life if I set things up correctly the first time.

*What are the general steps to gaining Financial Independence?*

*Having no experience with taxes, is there a video/article/website I should watch or read to help me become more comfortable?*

*Aside from Scholarships and Federal Aid, how can I minimize the costs of a college education?*

*Do you know any good scholarship websites? any good scholarships to apply for?*

*How does federal aid for education work? what is FASFA and what should a upcoming college goer be concerned with in regards to it?*

*Is paying off existing debt the number 1 goal before even attempting to invest any earnings?*

*What should I invest my job earnings in when I am in highschool, when I am college, when I am in residency, and when I am a practicing surgeon (mutal funds, CDs, stocks,)? I have no idea*

personalfinance,Can I use federal direct subsidized student loans to pay off part of my private Wells Fargo student loan?,"I have around $19,000.00 outstanding private student loan debt at 10.15% interest with Wells Fargo. I originally received the loan through Campus Door / Lehman brothers in the summer of '08, and my debt was bought(?) by Wells Fargo shortly there after. WF actually gave me a better interest rate, down from 14% I believe.

I'm still in school, finishing my bachelors degree, and I have the option to take two installments of $2,750 direct subsidized loans over two semesters (totaling $5,500.00), as well as direct unsubsidized loans totaling $7,000.00 over two semesters. My pell grants cover 95% of my cost of tuition, and I may get a scholarship too, so I don't have tuition-cost need for the loans. I will have one more year after this, so I'd probably be able to do it all again next year. 

Is this an option for me? I'm sure the interest rate from the federal government is better than Wells Fargo's 10%. Has anyone ever done this before?

personalfinance,Should I buy discount points for my mortgage?,"Some details:

- Loan amount: $230K
- Interest Rate Offered: 4.5%
- If I pay $2800 for the discount points, it will drop to 4.25%

Based on my calculations, if I buy the discount points, this reduces my monthly payments by $32.37.

I'll ""recover"" that $2800 in about 7-8 years (closer to 7 without taking into account inflation - closer to 8 taking into account inflation).

I really have no idea if I'll stay in the house that long. Ideally, I'd like to, but one never knows with the job market, etc. 

One thing I've not taken into account is the tax benefit of discount points. How much extra tax refund should I expect for them? Let's assume I don't take the standard deduction and itemize using Schedule A. If I get back, say, 30%, then I'll get it all back in about 5 and a half years, which may seem worth it. 

The alternative is that I don't buy the points and simply invest in, say, a mutual fund. If I get more than an equivalent of an annual 4.5% return over the period that I own the house, this seems like a win. I don't even have to worry about whether I'll stay in a house long enough, and in principle the money is available to me if I need it. Can I expect that return with mutual funds? Any other options to invest it in?

Would the savings in insurance outweigh the expected gain from investing that money?",finance,1401851419
personalfinance,"Planning on doing a payoff on my student loan, is that advisable?","I just graduated college and I recently unexpectedly came into possession of inheritance money. I have around 44k in student loans from my four years of undergrad, split across multiple loans with different interest rates: around 27k at 3.86% and the rest at 6.41%. My inheritance money totals more than the debt, around 52k total. This would leave me with roughly 8k if I did a payoff, leaving me free from student loans (which is all of the debt I have). 

This seems like the no-brainer decision, but I wanted to ask, **is there anything else I should be considering**?

More on my current situation: I have a couple thousand saved up from working over the past year or so, and I don't really have many monthly expenses right now; I work from home, so all gas I would buy is unnecessary spending anyway, and when I drive I take a family car that doesn't belong to me. I also live at home with my parents now and don't have to pay rent. Obviously I'm interested in independence ASAP (my own car, an apartment), and the job I'm working currently isn't going to be paying a whole lot (~31k a year starting) because I'm into computers and I'm working closely with the founders of a startup and we're hoping to make it big (as naïve as that sounds). However, it doesn't seem like a smart decision to hold debt just so I can access the money... but maybe I'm wrong.

*(Something else to consider that I just thought of... my parents are pretty bad in debt. Is it worth considering giving them some money to pay off stuff and then trying to get money back from them at a later date, assuming they'd pay the interest on my loans or something, or is that a slippery road to go down?)*

personalfinance,"Do I have to pay quarterly taxes in 2014 if I owed nothing/less than $1,000 for my income tax in 2013?","Hi! I'm awfully lost in the subject of paying freelance taxes, and so far, I've called the IRS (not helpful) and TurboTax (helpful) to try and get a clear answer on my issue:

I'm single and 21 years old, I've had my first freelance job since last July and filed my taxes in February 2014. I didn't make much to begin with and even less after deductions and expenses, and I didn't end up owing anything to the federal government/IRS. I owed $0, which is less than $1,000, of course. 

Now however, it is June 2014, and I am two weeks away from the second federal quarterly tax payment of the year. I am wondering if I need to cut a check to the IRS for this quarter, or rather if I don't need to do file anything this year and take care of it at a regular time. 

The IRS was confused on my question, but I read on a [web page] (https://www.freelancersunion.org/blog/2014/03/11/quarterly-tax-guide-freelancers-and-self-employed/) the following text:
&gt; If you paid no income tax in 2013 (or got a refund), you probably don’t need to pay quarterly taxes in 2014. If you’re in your first year of freelancing:, and if you had no freelance income last year to report, or that freelance income required that you pay less than $1,000 in taxes, no need to file this year. You can file at the end of the year (due April 15), like a regular gig. Just remember that on April 15, your end-of-the-year taxes from 2014 AND your taxes from the first quarter will be due at the same time. This can really throw off some first-timers.

I've come to ask r/finance (I guess r/tax and r/taxes weren't the right places for it) for help and hopefully a definitive answer - am I paying an amount to the IRS by June 16, or am I okay with holding off until next year? I'm doing a great job of saving money to care of these things and I damn well know that I am going to have to figure out quarterly tax payments eventually, but I would like to know what I need to be doing.

Bitcoin,An exhaustive look at private keys for the uninitiated.,"I wrote this explanation of private keys several months ago for folks in /r/BitcoinBeginners, but I thought some of the new people here might get some benefit out of it. There is no **TL;DR**. Sorry for the length! Any corrections or clarifications are welcome and appreciated!

A private key is just a really big number--that's it. If someone discovers the number you've chosen to use as your private key, they will be able to access any bitcoins assigned to that number. This may seem disconcerting at first. After all, if someone were to just happen to guess your number, they would have access to all your bitcoins, right? But many types of security come down to knowing or possessing something that is difficult to guess or reproduce. For example, a Master brand combination padlock with a 3 number combination on a dial with 0-36 has around 50,653 possible combinations (37^3 ). A typical pin-tumbler lock today has 5 pins with each pin having only about 10 different height levels meaning that there are only 100,000 (10^5 ) effective combinations for an average house key. Even a credit card number is only 15 characters long with 10 digits per character. That means there are only 10^15 possible combinations of credit card numbers which is equivalent to about 1 quadrillion (there is some added security by combining that number with an expiration date and 3-digit security code, but I'm ignoring that for now). The point is, we're accustomed to using much smaller pools of possible combinations to protect many parts of our lives today.

By comparison, a private key for Bitcoin begins as a 256-bit number or a number that is 256 characters long with 2 digits per character (a bit in the binary number system that computers understand is either 1 or 0), which is 2^256. That's huge. How huge? Remember that 10^15 was equal to a quadrillion? A 256-bit private key used for Bitcoin can be any number between 0 and 115 quattuorvigintillion 792 trevigintillion 89 duovigintillion 237 unvigintillion 316 vigintillion 195 novemdecillion 423 octodecillion 570 septendecillion 985 sexdecillion 8 quindecillion 687 quattuordecillion 907 tredecillion 852 duodecillion 837 undecillion 564 decillion 279 nonillion 74 octillion 904 septillion 382 sextillion 605 quintillion 163 quadrillion 141 trillion 518 billion 161 million 494 thousand 336.

In reality (because of some of the fancy math we do to ~~that 256-bit number to make it a bit more useable~~ create the public key pair value which we will use as the address), some of the available addresses will overlap, so the actual pool of available addresses is more like 2^160, but we're still talking about a gigantic number of possible addresses. To give you some context on the sheer scale of 2^160, the number of grains of sand on the Earth is estimated at about 2^66. The number of stars in the universe is estimated at about 2^76. There are approximately 2^96 atoms in a cubic meter of water, and the number of atoms in the sun is estimated at 2^190. Need a visual comparison? [This graph](https://i.imgur.com/ag3KQ0L.png) shows the number of available Bitcoin addresses compared to the width of the universe in Zeptometers (one Zeptometer is one quintillionth of a meter) and the age of the universe in Yoctoseconds (one Yoctosecond is one sextrillionth of a second). So your private key with its 2^160 possible combinations should be pretty safely hidden. Even a computer that could execute 10^13 instructions per second would take around 5 trillion years to guess your private key.

Since most humans can't keep a number in the quatturovigintillion's in their head, there are a number of tricks we can use to make it easier to manage. One thing we can do is to reduce the number of characters we have to remember, and the way to do that is to change the numerical base we use. Computers represent numbers in binary (also called base 2) which means every digit in the number is either a 0 or 1. To represent a private key in base 2, we have to use 256 places. To represent the same number in the base 10 we most commonly use, where each digit can be 0-9, we would only need 77 places. So, the higher the base, the smaller the resulting string. Base 16 (also known as hexadecimal) uses 0-9 and A-F for a total of 16 different possibilities for each digit. This reduces the number of places needed to represent the number to 64. There are many other bases that use different characters to represent more and more of the number, but the most common numerical base to use for Bitcoin addresses is Base 58 (actually, it's a special version of Base 58 called Base58Check which only uses characters that are not easily confused visually like 0 and O, and includes a 32-bit checksum appended to the payload, and has an extra step to preserve leading zero bytes). The result is a string of letters and numbers that is usually about 51 characters long.

Of course, if you don't want to waste time trying to memorize a string of 51 characters, most of us trust our Bitcoin wallet applications to write that number to a file and to keep track of it for us. But anytime you write down your key, you make it vulnerable to being discovered, especially if the thing you write it on is connected to the Internet. This is why it is smart to encrypt the file containing your private key. And this is where some people get confused: The passphrase for your private key, in this example, is only for locally decrypting a file on your computer or device that stores your private key. It is not for using or accessing the private key itself. ***You cannot passphrase-protect the ability to use your private key to prevent an unauthorized person from using your private key, you can only take steps to hide what that key actually is.***

Another way you can hide your private key to make it easier to transport on paper is by using an encryption process developed specifically for Bitcoin addresses known as BIP38 (BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). BIP38 allows you to create a new address which looks similar to a Bitcoin private key, but will not function as one directly. Instead, you will need to decrypt the BIP38 address using a program that understands how to decrypt BIP38 using the passphrase that encrypted the address. This is a handy process because you can carry a BIP38 protected address around on a piece of paper, and as long as you remember the passphrase, your bitcoins should remain safe even if the paper is stolen or lost. Again, this doesn't protect someone from using your private key if they discover it in some other way, but it will conceal your private key when you write it down to make it more difficult to discover. 

Now, you may have heard in some cases that a passphrase ***is*** a private key. This may be confusing, but this is just referring to another way to keep track of this very large number. There are mathmatical formulas that can take data of any length and by passing it through the formula they create a number with the same number of bits every time. These formulas are called hashing algorithms. One such hashing algorithm is called SHA-256 which can take data of any length and produce a 256-bit number from it. You could give it a single word that's 6 letters long, or give it a text file with all the collected works of William Shakespeare in it and each one would produce a unique 256-bit number. And because of the properties of the formula, as long as you feed it the same data that you did originally it will always produce the same number as a result (called a hash). So, when someone tells you that their passphrase is their private key, they mean that they have fed their passphrase through a hashing algorithm to produce a 256-bit number from which they can use as their private key. This process is also known as a brain wallet. While this may seem clever you're essentially pitting your memory capacity against a cracker with a computer, and the odds are the computer will win. Please avoid using brain wallets if you have the choice.

If your private key is ever exposed or if it can ever be calculated using a hashing algorithm, that is all someone needs to take any bitcoins contained in that address, so take good care of it!

**edit2:** updated the name of the number between which private keys can be used, and clarifying that the math is applied to the public key which is what introduces the potential for collisions

personalfinance,Saving for a home and/or paying off a large amount of student loan debt?,"Hey Reddit, I am hoping to get some opinions on whether it seems like I am doing the right things when it comes to my personal finances.

I'm a 25M living in Los Angeles.  Home prices out here are ridiculous so I'm trying to start saving early.  To give you a rough idea, mediocre houses in good areas are going to be 800k-ish out here.  I have a lot of student loan debt as I'm only a few years out of college and I bought a new car a few months ago which added to my debt.  I'm trying to determine how I should balance paying off my debt without completely ignoring my goal of being a homeowner someday.

My theory is that I can spend the next 7 years paying off my loans completely but then I'm going to be 32 and have nothing saved up for a house.  I realize that paying off higher interest loans first means that I will save more money long term but that also means I wont have much liquid cash in 7 or so years to buy a home.  I've currently been paying minimum payments on all my student loans and putting extra income into a taxable investment account to save up for a house.  I chose a taxable account because I anticipate that I will want to withdraw the money in less than 10 years time.  I assume that means I should not put it in my 401k, but maybe I'm missing something.

Here's a quick rundown of my current finances:
I bring in 105k/yr salary at my main place of employment but also do consulting on the side for an extra ~5k/yr.
Rent: 1650
Student Loans: 700 (minimum)
Car payment: 550
Insurance: 200
Utilities: 75
Phone: 45
Restaurants: 350
Bars/Entertainment: 200
Groceries: 150

Depending on the time of the year, a lot more may go toward travel, operating my consulting business, gifts, clothing, taxes, etc.  I think generally I have around $600 at the end of the month to work with.

Here's what I currently have saved:
Emergency Savings: 20k
401k: 8k (employer matches up to 3k a year)
Taxable Investment Account (home savings): 5k

Less common investments:
BitCoins: 1.5k (in USD)
Start-up Equity: 2k across 2 companies (I realize this can disappear at any time)
Start-up stock options: +$600 (and should keep growing as more stock vests)

I feel like I'm a little low on my retirement savings currently but am hoping that one of these start-ups is going to work out and contribute to my retirement.

Current Loans:
5k @ 5.35% Federal Student Loan (Fixed Rate)
5k @ 5.75% Federal Student Loan (Fixed Rate)
9k @ 6.55% Federal Student Loan (Fixed Rate)
45k @ 3% Private Student Loan (Variable Rate)
14.5k @ 3.75% Private Student Loan (Variable Rate)
33k @ 3.29% Car Loan (Car is worth more than amount owed to bank)

It makes me nervous that so much of my student loan debt has variable interest rates.  Right now the rates are low but can't predict the future.  In general, I'm fortunate that because of my job I haven't really had to ""feel the pain"" of my debt to date.  I do however want to save for a house and would love to hear your input.

I have about 5k in gold/silver invested but it has been coming down and I am not sure whether to buy or sell at this point. The Bullish contrarian view makes sense due to the debt of the country and Fed policy. However, that is my subjective viewpoint and there is an argument for both sides. I don't think I want to sell any of my PM, maybe an ounce of gold for around 1200 to help add to my investment money? What would you do with the money if you were sort of bearish on the dollar? Short stocks? Buy more metals?(Although I would like to diversify and I am not as convinced on metals as I used to be, it looks like it could possibly be a bear market for a little while.)

personalfinance,(Serious Discussion) Leaving the United States due to crippling student loan debts.,"**Opening Statement:**
Hello, I am a 33 year old man with a law degree from a middle rate mid-western state university. I also have bachelors in philosophy and a minor in accounting from another university. I have over 220k in student loan debt (100k gov loans, 120k private. Interest rates between 8-13%.) Currently I work at one of the larger firms in the midwest for a decent amount (70k pre tax). This account is a throwaway for obvious reasons and I won't bother offering any personal details given the nature of the questions I'm asking. As for why I'm asking this question in personal finance as opposed to /r/StudentLoans or /r/Debt well to put it plainly, this discussion will be more effective with a larger audience to offer their views and to the point, could be very helpful to other desperate Americans who may stand to learn from this situation who might otherwise miss it in those smaller subs.


First off, this discussion should be technical only... meaning I don't want to hear about your indignation or cries of immorality at the prospect of leaving the country to avoid debts. To the point, I don't give a shit about your personal beliefs and you shouldn't care for my personal actions to cast a negative light on it...

**My Situation:**
To begin, my student loans reflect the stupidity of believing a law degree would quickly be able to pay itself off without too much hassle... oh how wrong I was. After graduating in the height of the economic meltdown (late starter to undergrad) I found myself in one of the most depressed job markets for my degree and after a year or unemployment at any reputable firms found myself applying for a hardship waver due to some familial circumstances. During this time I worked at a local best buy peddling (overpriced) electronics to unknowing consumers for slightly above minimum wage. A year later I finally found some work as an unpaid intern at a local courthouse trying to buy favor with any judge or attorney that would have me so as to get my name circulating. Finally a managed to land my current job and I've been stuck doing it for the last year and half. However it is now readily apparent to me that I will NEVER EVER be able to live comfortably with this debt cloud looming over my every foot-step... just keeping up on my interest rates alone take a work of herculean proportions on my end... It's ironic, I thought getting a law degree meant I'd live a good life and have a great family, a nice 4 door sedan, and a house by the time I was in my 30's. Yet I have none of that, I have a 2001 Toyota Camry, a 1 bedroom apartment, and a pantry full of rice &amp; beans. Every day I leave my house dreading (and sometimes starving) another collections call on a loan I cannot pay. I've seriously contemplated suicide because I can't even declare bankruptcy to discharge my debts, and thus it seems I'm lef to live a life of mediocrity as a indentured debt slave to a predatory system of student loans... 

**Meat &amp; Potatoes Starts Here**
Given the aforementioned circumstances, I wish to entertain a discussion on the technicalities of leaving the United States for the purposes of avoiding the debts accrued over the course of my education. I have done some minor research on it and I'm not sure if this would be a viable solution to this problem.

- Would leaving the US absolve me of my obligation of repayment on the remainder of my student loans?

- Would my US credit history being destroyed as a result of refusal of payment infringe on my employment prospects OUTSIDE of the US?

-  What sort of penalties, legally speaking would I be facing? Could the US seek to extradite me and force me to pay off my debts?


**Alternative Solution?**
- If I were to take out a bunch of unsecured credit cards to service the entirety of my debts and then leave for a period of time, say 10 years would I then in be able to return debt free? In this context, the student loans would be ""paid"" off but the credit cards wouldn't. After this period of time the collections agencies wouldn't have the means or will to track me down and after that period of time in theory would place me under the ""uncollectible"" thus writing me off their books.
- Alternatively, could I do the above process but rather then leave the country simply declare bankruptcy after the loans have been repaid?
- To clarify, I would use a number of small sum unsecured credit cards (in the mail daily it seems) over a period of years to service my debts and avoid falling into collections over my student loans. My credit card debts would slowly overtake the Student loan debts, but unlike my Student loans... can be forgiven through bankruptcy (oddly enough, so could student loans up until 2004.)

**Final Statement:** Listen, I understand the above discussion is highly questionable from a moral standpoint... it's ethically completely wrong but given my situation I wouldn't be considering it if there was a light at the end of the tunnel. As it stands though I'm peering into the abyss with the catcalls of collections agencies cackling along and draining the fucking life outta me. This post is me hoping that there might just be a rope somewhere in this deep tunnel I find myself in to pull me out. It's a crazy idea, an alternative one, a radical one, and a historical one... but it's the only one short of death (either a quick self inflicted one, or a long drawn out one barely surviving along the way having never properly lived.) that seems possible at this current rate. I mean short of hoping for some Fight club esque scenario where student loan debts are erased in a flash of humanity or an epiphany in Washington that over takes both aisles into realizing that student loans are turning an entire generation into futureless debt slaves there doesn't seem to be much hope or concern for the people of my plight.

If you've read this far, thank you for your time... if your young, don't pay out of state tuition, and don't think that a college degree means an easy way into middle class suburbia. Sadly that dream ended 20 years ago it would seem.

personalfinance,Is my strategy sound?,"So I was unemployed for about a year ~2008. During that time I racked up nearly 30k in credit card debt; I was a stupid kid, too prideful to move home, etc... Sometime in 2009 I managed to get a job, not a well paying job but a job. Of course as soon as I do my car dies and I have to get a new one. My salaries since gone up to a more reasonable rate. The credit debt is down to about 20k now. In about a year I'll have ~60k in student loans come due.

My current strategy is to make as large a payment as possible on the card with the highest interest rate, making payments a little bit above minimum on the others. I have nothing saved towards retirement, and minimal savings (enough for a few months rent).

Is my strategy sound or should I be concerned that at 30 I haven't started saving for retirement? My thinking is that the rate on return in a retirement account would surely be lower than the interest fees on a credit card.",finance,1401886163

I'm a recently married 27 year old. Wife is the same age. We are renting an apartment in New York City for $1,200 a month. 
I'm at a job that currently pays me about $45,000 a year (which I feel is less than what I should be making). My wife is making $52,000 a year. 

As far as our investments go, I have a nonqualified annuity worth about $13,500 and another nonqualified brokerage account worth about $11,000. I'm contributing 10% to my 401K (worth approx. $7,000 with no company match) and I have an IRA worth $1,000. My wife just started her 401k and is contributing 8% per paycheck. She also has an IRA worth $3,000. We have a joint savings account that has about $7,000 in it and we have another checking account that serves to pay our monthly bills. 
 
As far as debt goes, I have 2 credit cards that total to about $2,200 that I am paying off. 

My wife has 2 cards that total $9,800 that she is paying off. 

She also has student loans totaling $19,400. The interest rate on the largest loan ($11,300) is 6.8%. The next largest ($7,300) is 2.3%

That's the backstory. We have a few goals in mind and I want to see if they're attainable considering our salary and debt.
My main focus is to put as much into savings as possible while also knocking out those nasty credit cards, then once those are manageable, going after her student loans. 

We'd like to have a child and own a home in a year or two, but I don't know how possible it is with the current situation. 

As it stands, we do not have many monthly expenses outside of rent, electric, food and entertainment. We don't have much issue paying more than the minimum for our cards. 

So what's the best way to go about pairing down our debt and saving to buy a house?

personalfinance,I want to take out ~$6k student loan to use immediately over this summer. I am a graduate student.,"I am in graduate school being supported through a fellowship and get a small monthly stipend.  While I am in school, I want to take advantage of still being able to get a school loan rather than some other type of collateral based loan and use it for something else.  I am currently $29k in debt (all stafford loans) from my undergrad and should make enough when I am finished school where 20% more will not matter.  I will need this money all upfront this summer-not dispersed through multiple semesters.  
  
So far I know that I could get government unsubsidized loans in graduate school, but I don't think the funds would be dispersed how I would need them.  If I am wrong, please tell me.  The other way would be private student loans which I know next to nothing about.  If I do not have a co-signer am I going to be screwed with interest rates? I have a credit history (~5 years) and a credit score of about 750 I think. 
  
Any advice would be appreciated in terms of how to go about private student loans and what my best options are.  I know you guys are usually anti-more loans, but I know what I am getting myself into. 
  
Thanks.
  
  
  

EDIT:  If anyone has advice on my question about the loans that would be great.  So far all I have gotten for the most part is criticism about taking it out in the first place.  I fully understand the repercussions and the negative aspects of it.  I also could write up a whole thing about why I am doing it and why it will not affect me in the future, but that is unnecessary for the question to be answered and I am not looking for critiques in that manner.

personalfinance,About to return to college and am also rebuilding my credit. Student loans question.,"As the title suggests, I am returning to college after about 15 years.  As a younger me I was very bad with money, and have been working on my credit for the last 3 years or so.  I have moved my score from around 550  to around 675.  I currently have 3 credit cards with a total balance of $750 of a $3000 limit.  One is a new card that is 0% until June of next year.  I pay the balance of the other two, and am paying minimum on that one.

I got my financial aid package, and will be able to pay all of my tuition with the federal pell grant.  I only have to cover transportation, books etc.  I have a small savings account that I have been planning to use to pay for them.

My question is, would it be a good idea to take a portion of the subsidized loan to pay for these?  I would only need to use approx. $2000 of it, and would pay it off over the course of the year.  This would mean it is 0% loan.  Would paying it off like this be reported to the credit bureaus as a payment history since the loan wouldn't become due until I graduated?  

If it matters I will still be working so will be paying all the household bills from my job so I won't need the money for food, housing etc.",finance,1401888702

For instance... 
The benchmark interest rate in the United States was last recorded at 0.25 percent. Interest Rate in the United States averaged 6.05 Percent from 1971 until 2014, reaching an all time high of 20 Percent in March of 1980 and a record low of 0.25 Percent in December of 2008.

I don't want to screw up and owe too much or have a huge refund. My current setup allows me to come pretty darn close to a flat '0' at tax return time, which is my goal.

How would I go about this? Are my current withholdings going to be fine for this bump in pay, or will they be too high or too low since I assume I'll be in a new tax bracket?

personalfinance,Doubling our family income with lots of debt and minimal savings. Where do we begin?,"I make 96k and we've been living off of just my income for the last 1.5 years (kind-of).  We have 2 kids (1 and 2yrs old).  My wife has been in school finishing her masters degree part-time, and we've been using her education status to borrow extra money in her student loans, which allows her to stay home with the kids. (Believe it or not, my salary doesn't cover our basic bills+expenses)   

we knew borrowing to live wasn't financially smart, but it was a choice we made to allow her to be home with our kids while they were babies.  

She just graduated (Nurse Practitioner) and landed a job making 105k.  It's a great salary, but we need to make some serious decisions how to slice up the money.  We own 2 homes (1 is rented, and the rental income mostly covers the mortgage payment).

Mortgage 1: 1134, collecting 1100 in rent.  It's worth less than we owe, so selling isn't an option right now.  We moved to a higher cost of living area to be closer to family where we'll have no child care costs.  
Mortgage 2: 2400

Credit card debt: 26k (currently minimums are about 500/month), we are considering consolidating into a 3 or 5 yr, fixed payment loan to be on a schedule to knock them out.  Currently they are on 0% promotional offers which are all expiring at different times, but soon.  We could probably do another transfer, but not all to 1 card, because i don't think either of us will get approved on one card for that type of balance.  

Her student loans: 150k (Undergrad+Graduate), about 50% federal 50% private.  We are estimating about 1200/month.  

My student loans: 25k, 300/month.  

We have 2 car loans, totaling about 25k (650/month combined at 2 and 4% interest)

We have an unrecorded loan with her dad from when we borrowed money from him for our wedding, and some living expenses before I was making good money, and when she was still in school for undergraduate.  This loan is about 35k, tied to his home equity (he passes the interest along to us) at about 5% (variable rate).  The monthly ""minimum"" payment is flexible, and the debt isn't recorded on our credit score, but we need to pay it eventually.  

We have about 5k in savings.  I have a very secure stable job that provides a 401k type retirement account + pension.  I currently contribute 6% and get a 5% match.  I've been here about 4 years; the account has about 30k.  

We know we haven't been super responsible in the past, but now that we have a good income, we want to create good habits to get out of this hole we've dug for ourselves, but honestly, don't know where to start.  

We plan on paying off both cars and are planning on not buying new ones until we have cash to do so.  Credit cards are also a top priority.  Beyond that, we want to have some long-term emergency fund savings, she needs to start a 401k, I want to increase my 401k contributions;  we'd like to start college funds for our kids, we want to start a mid-term (non-emergency) savings account for things like tires on the cars, vacations, etc, so we dont have to touch the emergency fund for stuff like that.  

When you start to divvy up the money, it just doesn't seem to go far enough.  I guess the ultimate question here is, what are the priorities?  Short-term savings?  Emergency fund?  Debt?  Where to begin, credit cards, cars, student loans?

personalfinance,Some help with various things.,"I'm a 21-year-old college student with several general finance questions that I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me out with.

First, my boyfriend and I are working on moving in together and are each trying to make a budget and clear up any loose financial ends before we do so. He had worked for a couple of months at a commission-based job where no income taxes were taken out. He didn't work there long or make terribly much, but neither of us are sure what to do about the taxes. A co-worker of his told him that if he ""cashed-out"" each day (took his commission for the day in cash when leaving the office) he didn't have to pay taxes on it because you could write off up to some amount in cash as a gift. However, when he worked that job, I encouraged him to make them write him checks so that he had the stubs for record and so that if we needed proof of income for renting, he had it. He only ended up getting 3 checks from them, one for about $140, one for about $8, and one for about $4 and cashed out a few times, as well. I imagine we could look back on bank statements to get approximate total income from those couple of months if we need to since he's usually pretty good about depositing any money that comes in. What exactly do we need to do to get his taxes in order? Do we just wait for the end of the year? He was technically considered a independent contractor, so I don't know if they'll send a W-4 or anything similar regarding income... Any advice would be much appreciated!

Second, as I mentioned, we are moving out of our respective parents' houses and into a house together that we will be renting, along with two friends of ours, for $750/month. I'd really like to get a solid budget in place for my finances. I've done a variety of spreadsheet and handwritten budgets in the past and I can never seem to stick to them or make them work. To amend this, I've started looking into the methods behind YNAB and am 3 days into their 9-day email course. I'm still not sure about spending the $60 on the software and wanted to get your opinions on it, if you've used it, if you still use it, if you think it's worth the money, if you think it really helps, etc. 

Finally, I've never lived on my own and imagine I'm going to overlook a lot of expenses associated with being independent. I've got the obvious down, groceries, utilities, etc. but am wondering if there are any expenses that you could clue me in to that I may not be expecting so that I can work them into my budget as well.


Some basic financial info on me, if that helps with my budgeting questions:

Income: This one is tricky. I currently make about $1200/month net (working 40-hour weeks at $10/hour), but have just accepted an internship which will be 40-hour weeks during the summer and 20-hour weeks during the fall and spring semesters, at $12.71/hr. This transition right when we're about to move is making me pretty nervous about paying for everything.

Savings: Just over $2,000

Checking: ~$50

Expenses:

Rent: $750/4 = ~$188

Phone: $45

Internet: $70/4 = ~$18

Other Utilities: Really not sure what these sorts of things typically run. I imagine that splitting it four ways should make it fairly minimal, I've been guestimating ~$150/month combined.

Gas: Currently ~$80 in the summer months, ~$150 during school. Not sure what it will be, my internship is a farther drive than my current job and I'll have to be driving during traffic, not sure what impact this will have on my gas bill each month.

Groceries: The four of us will be splitting groceries for the most part, with the exception of snacks and stuff we buy just for ourselves. I'm estimating &lt;$70/week, but am not sure how accurate this is going to be yet.

Car: I owe just over $5,000 and pay $100/month with no interest. I pay $55/month for insurance.

Credit cards: I have 1 Chase Freedom MasterCard that I put school expenses on. Right now the balance is just over $5,500 and I pay $150/month. Minimum is $107, I think. 13% interest.

Student Loans: I owe about $8,000 total to SallieMae, but only about $1,200 of it is unsubsidized, so I pay on those two loans about $50 a month, just to keep the interest down and chip away at the principle some. Interest is 6.8% on them. 3.4% on the subsidized ones, but it's deferred until 6 months after I'm out of school.

I also have a Parent Plus loan through FedLoans with just a couple hundred dollars left; I plan to pay it off with my next paycheck.

I think that's everything... Please let me know if there's something obvious that I've overlooked, or if you have any recommendations for me. Any advice is much appreciated!",finance,1401915018
Forex,Full ECB Walkthrough,"**NB: This was an e-mail that did the rounds today -- I can't take credit for it. Apologies in advance for the crap formatting.**

Tomorrows main event clearly on everyone’s mind – thanks to my Forwards team experts for the help in putting this together – please see the possible outcomes for tomorrow and how they could be perceived.

Pricing:
 
Eonia today 19.1bp.  Current pricing is 5bp by Dec 2014.



What could they do ?

(1) Cut Refi (including reduce MLF)

(2) Cancel the Drain (SMP)

(3) QE (sov/ABS)

(4) LTRO (incl. extend MROs)

(5) LTRO + FLS

(6) Negative Deposit rate

(7) Reduce Reserve Requirements + other


Let’s take a look at each one and see what is what 

Of course there could be combinations of any / all of the below but for each potential policy you can see both sides of the coin –
 
I hope you find this useful and good luck tomorrow – we will all probably need it !


(1) Cut Refi (and/or cut MLF)
 
**Positives**
Signals intent, reinforces forward guidance’s easing bias.
Cheapens MRO and existing vLTROs (They’re floating rate).
Cutting the MLF (alone or in tandem with Refi) could be helpful to put a lid on recent Eonia spikes.
Cutting MLF brings down ELA to Greece, Cyprus and Ireland (priced at MLF+200bp).
 
**Negatives**
Wasn’t hugely effective when they cut the last 25bp – particularly for FX.


(2) Cancel the Drain (weekly SMP sterilisation)

**Positives**  
It’s large, It would be tantamount to making previous PIIG QE explicit (and thus signals opening door to new QE?
More palatable than outright QE (I don’t see “ECB cancels drain” hitting front page of German papers too
much).
Drain isn’t compulsory; it fails fairly regularly these days, giving the system a “free option’ on that
previous QE money anyway?
If they cut the deposit rate, one would assume you’ll need to do it in conjunction with cancelling drain or
LTRO or anything that injects liquidity in size, otherwise that week’s LTRO repayments may be large and
Eonia will trade at Refi rather than depo. (Although note the driver would be psychological since the
previous LTROs are floating rate so the cost of holding liquidity remains).
 
**Negatives**
Its effectively QE, but Bundesbank has signed off on that given potential financial risks with yields so low.
Doesn’t seem fair maybe?. It’d be QE on SMP which is basically QE on PIIG bonds…..
You could imagine France thinking “if we’re going down QE road why not buy some of my debt too please”.

(3) QE ( Sov /ABS)

**Positives**
Catch up with the rest of the world…..
Re ABS, see https://www.ecbforum.eu/up/artigos-bin_paper_pdf_0592126001401111269-987.pdf pp 15-16.
 
**Negatives**
Germany
Peripheral yields have collapsed so far this year anyway, Ireland + Greece issuing; 10y Ireland c.2.6%
already; how low is low?
How to buy is confusing - GDP weighted basket? Sovereign or go wider to corps etc? But GDP weighted
still involves a lump of bunds  
Is it really sensible for a CB to buy bunds when 10y yields 1.4%?

(4)  LTRO (incl. extend MRO full allotment)
 
**Positives**
Stops Euro system liquidity surplus falling and the concurrent rise in Eonia. It seems counterintuitive to
have euro area with passive tightening when US is still expanding liquidity (tapering isn’t tightening, it’s a
slower pace of expansion…).
 
Open to wide range of participants.
 
Could make it fixed rate (previous 2 were floating rate) at the new Refi – this would tie in nicely with the
fwd guidance concept that Fed BoE ECB have all used yet the ECB is the only one to not “back up” with
conditionality.

If they cut the deposit rate, one would assume you’ll need to do it in conjunction with cancelling drain or
LTRO, anything that injects liquidity of size, otherwise that week’s LTRO repayments will be massive and
the Eonia will trade up to/through the new Refi.
 
**Negatives**
Odd to give a system more LTRO when it’s still voluntarily repaying previous cash early. 
Then again even though system is repaying in aggregate its good names repaying but bad ones are not as they still need cash e.g. Italian banks have repaid only c.30%.


(5) LTRO + FLS/conditionality
 
**Positives**
Follow BoE FLS scheme route.
Targets cash to SMEs.
Politically palatable (even though would likely involve a transfer to periphery).
 
**Negatives**
Coordination across such a diverse bloc as the Euro zone.

(6) Negative Deposit rate

**Positives**
Shock the system, 1st major CB to employ it in current era.
Strongest signal to Eur/$ spot rate – would show how much is priced in from initial reaction
Maintains Refit - corridor width; some argue this would allow continuing money market functioning (as
Fed has implicitly by continuing to pay IOER to keep the corridor open). Ionia volumes only c.25bio as it is.
 
**Negatives**
Aggressive in my mind, but accept that House view and market is more sanguine on this.
Effect on bank margins?
SNB thought it could even widen margins, which would be desirable for them in cooling property markets, but hardly what Europe needs.

(7) Reduce reserve requirements and anything new they might come up with.
 
**Positives**
RR currently 103bio. These are in the calculation of the system surplus so far e.g. Halving these would

personalfinance,Paying off unsubsidized student loans with the same interest rate and different principles. Is there an optimal way to pay them off?,"Here's a simplified rundown of my current situation:

I'm in grad school, so my student loans are in deferment. I have both subsidized and unsubsidized loans lumped together into three ""big loans"", but my lender applies payments made during deferment first to interest, then to unsubsidized loans, then to subsidized. For that reason, I'm making consistent monthly payments on them to pay off interest and unsubsidized only at this moment.

My unsubsidized loans (when separated from the ""big loans"" they're part of) are as follows:

1. ~$2500 @ 6.8% interest
2. ~$2500 @ 6.8% interest
3. ~$5000 @ 6.8% interest

I've been making monthly payments of $400 to the three loans. $200/mo to the third loan, and $100/mo each to the first two loans. It recently occurred to me however that this may not be the best manner in which to do things, although mathematically I don't think it matters (seeing as how I have no monthly payments that I have to make, being in deferment in all).

Is there a better way to do things, PF? Thanks!",finance,1401918053

Here is my question.  I have $13,564 left of my truck that is being financed.  My interest rate is 4.7% and my monthly payment is fixed at $410.39

I also have student loan debt.  With company A I have a direct subsidized load for $1,930.58 with a fixed rate at 4.5% and with the same company I have a direct unsubsidized loan with fixed rate at 6.8% for $4,952.66  My monthly payment has been around $34.71 for the both since I am on a Income Base Repayment plan, however my monthly bill will be rising soon since I failed to renew the plan.

Thanks.

_________________
Original statement:


No, don't consolidate.
Do you want the bare-knuckled ninja way to handle debt? Because there's another option very few know about.
First, I'm a lawyer and used to do bankruptcies. I am also an accountant.
Let's talk default.

What? That's trouble!

No it isn't. You can do this in 12-18 months and come out unscathed. The banks will NOT like you, but I don't have much, if any, sympathy for them. You could go for chapter 7 or 13, but save a bankruptcy for when you really need it.

Stop paying on your cards. Those interest rates are ridiculous (usury laws need to be put back in place) and you should NOT pay $30k on $6k. Just ridiculous.

Instead, put every bit of your payments into savings. Do not touch it. Put as much as possible into savings additionally.

Now stop paying on your cards.

The banks will go nuts for the first 180 days. When they call, tell them that they have the wrong number. Or change your number if possible. You can also screen your calls and then call the company's general number and complain that they're leaving messages for someone who had the number before you. Collections are aggressive, but they're not the sharpest knives in the drawer. Don't feel bad about lying to them because they will lie to you. If they get really nasty, take them to small claims under the FDCPA. You can win up to $1,500 if they violate the FDCPA.

No, you won't be sued. And even if they do, I'll tell you how to handle it later. They rarely sue because that involves a few thousand to a lawyer and there's an old saying in the biz, ""don't throw good money after bad."" Getting a judgment is easy. Collecting a judgment is an expensive pain in the balls. Anyone they send after you to collect judgment will probably want 50% and, after the lawyer's costs and everything, they usually end up further in the hole. Which is why they rarely sue.

OK, you've defaulted. Do not worry about your credit score. Yes, it will go down, but that can be fixed. I'll get to that later. You don't need it unless you're buying a house or car or something big. You don't want to open another credit card, that's for sure, so it's not a big deal if it takes a hit.

After 180 days, GAAP requires banks to take bad debt off the books. This is a charge off. Statistically, when debt is over 180 days, the recovery rates are somewhere below 1%. It's dead, and then your debt gets shuffled off to collection agencies. Bad debt gets traded around in portfolios. People buy it for pennies on the dollar (it's worth less the older it gets) and the person who buys your $6k debt might only have $200 or $300 into it. If they can't collect, they then sell it to someone else.

This is where you can cut a deal. I've seen some go as low as 10% to pay off a debt. Usually, you're looking at 40%-50% or so. This is where your savings come in. Go to whoever holds your $6k card and offer them $2k to settle it. If they only have a few hundred into buying it, that's a good deal for them. That's a profit and they know they're not going to get the whole thing. They're used to these deals and 95% of the stuff they're chasing has no money in it at all.

When you settle, you can also include a provision requiring them to remove all negative credit information. Most will agree because it costs them nothing, means nothing to them, and - hey - they get paid if they agree.

What you want is Nolo's book on bankruptcy and credit repair. Nolo is good and they will have all the correct letters and forms for you. Use it and be sure to follow up with the credit reporting agencies.

Do this and you'll get out of debt in 12-18 months and have a perfect credit score. It'll cost you $3k-$5k total.

Morally? Look, you guys have paid so much interest that you've already paid the bank back. Get your statements and add it up. You've probably repaid the debt already, so don't worry too much about their bottom line. Further, even if they take a loss, who cares? Banks don't pay any taxes and get to borrow at 0% from the fed, so they're making huge profits at taxpayer expense. Do not feel bad for the banks. They get every possible advantage while holding your face down in the mud. Default is legal and this is what happens when you default. Default might be your best option.

Oh, forgot to cover what happens if they sue. Like I said, this probably won't happen. But if they sue and win, the judgment rate will be lower than your usual rate! Most courts have a low interest rate for judgments, often 5% to 10%, simple interest. The freakin' court will give you a better interest rate than the banks do! So the absolute worst case scenario is that you will end up paying less than you are today!

Also, courts everywhere are backed up like crazy. If they do file suit, file a reply and the trial date will probably be 12-36 months out. Yeah, really. So that would be 12-36 months where you could save up and make offers to settle. 

They will settle. Further, the court will have some kind of mediation system where you can go in and bargain. So, really, do not worry about being sued. Even if that happens, you will be better off than you are today.
Seriously, default is a no-lose scenario. No matter what happens, you'll be better off. More people should do this.

Here is some info:
Married (both 29)
Personal income 40-50k/yr
Partners income: 45k/yr
Partner has about 50k in student loan debt and 4k on a credit card.
Perfect payment history on all of my credit accounts
beacon around 740-760 for both of us

Goals:
Want to have kids but must have a home first for stability. We were planning on kids in about a year.

So I have been working hard to pay off any and all debt in my name and am now free of most of my debt, I own one vehicle which my wife drives and I am still paying on my current driver. I have no other debt than my current vehicle.

I signed up on credit Karma and was advised that my credit has been hurt due to using 0% of my available credit (is this true). I have never missed or been late on a payment through any of my accounts through the years. 

I have been reading on PF about buying a home and everyone keeps stating not to do FHA loans and that you should not buy a home unless you are able to put at least 20% down due to PMI being carried through the life of the loan now. If I need to be at 20% down then it only extends the time we will be waiting to start a family further into our 30's. 

The reason we have not been on this sooner is that I supported my partner through Grad school and she was unable to get into a decent job until this last year. I was advised that you need good work history prior to applying for a loan so we wanted to insure my partner had at least 1 year in the new job. I guess at this point I feel like I have been working my ass of to get into a house only to be told that I need to now save for another 2-3 years prior to being able to purchase. 

I was planning on going into a home loan with 10-15k down but it looks like I will need 30-45k as far as I can tell. We are looking at family homes for 150k-200k and we have not spoken to a mortgage broker yet as I do not want to start a process until I have all my ducks in a row. I had also seen that rates were locked in by the fed until 2015 which we are quickly approaching and I do not want to miss out on a great rate. 

I have many friends through out the years that have purchased homes and most of them had little to no money down. They are still in their homes and seem to be content with them.

TL:DR been working hard to get into a home and am now discouraged from doing so as it feels like life is passing by while I work to ""buy a home the right way"".

personalfinance,$220k in student loans as a M.Arch graduate.,"First, thanks for reading and/or the reply!


I have $220k in student loans! It seems like such a large, unattainable sum, that it doesn’t even register as real. I do have a job, its even related to my field (turns out a degree in architecture isn't worthless). I am happy, some days even hopeful, but went to [unbury.us](http://www.unbury.us/) and put in all my loans and got a rather disheartening message ‘you will never pay off this loan! Please try again!’


Seeing this in conjunction with a new car loan (used car, old car died) and paying off my credit card ($5,500) which saved my butt going through school, and other bills (yay being an adult!) I feel my budget might not be sufficient. 


I have been making all of my student loan payments (min), and throwing all my extra money at my credit card, which I will then be allocating to my loans, highest interest rate first.


My loans are as followed:


$88,953.69       7.65% Graduate/Gov
$10,412.92       6.80% Undergrad/Gov
$98,699.40       6.55% Graduate/Gov
$5,248.40         5.75% Undergraduate/Gov
$1,484.38	        5.00% Graduate/Private
$11,215.52       5.00% Graduate/Private
$2,349.78	        2.35% Graduate/Gov


I make $21/hr (I got a raise a few weeks ago and can pay all my bills!), roughly $620/week after taxes. My budget allows for $400/mo to my CC, $450/mo for rent, groceries, gas, car insurance (health I get free through work!), $60/mo for savings, $100/mo for IRA (no match through work for another 6 months), and this leaves me with around $100/mo slush, which goes to my CC.


I do have a comprehensive budget, and even did a spreadsheet with my loans (without interest rates) and it got paid off in 19 years (just in time to help my kids out with school?)


I guess my question is, do I have a chance at ever owning a home? Having a life where I can go out with friends? A life without debt? Or do I just wait for some kind of act of God?


Are there other routs to follow to eliminate my debt without sacrificing 10 years to public service outside of architecture (there are limited to no government jobs in architecture and would effectively render my degree useless after being out of the field for 10 years). 


Is there a way to reduce my interest rates (they seem rather high). I talked one of my lender that hold 5 of my loans (the highest monetary loan amounts) and they told me it would be worthless to consolidate as my highest monetary loans are also my highest interest rate loans.


I talked with a real-estate agent who said that I could roll my student loans into a mortgage under a lower interest rate, but that seems really dangerous… having $450K tied into a $230K home at a 4.55% interest rate?


Is there any hope, or am I doing it right, and just grind it out… forever…


Sorry about the long post, but its been eating away at me.

personalfinance,"Co-worker's advice: Continue paying the minimum on student loans, but max out 401k contributions","I just found this sub-reddit today, and have been trying to take in as much as I can from reading the side-bar topics, to reading several pages worth of the top topics. However, I've always wanted to ask someone about what my older, presumably wiser coworker said to me when I started a few years ago, but never had the right person to ask so I'll pose it here. 


He said that I should continue paying the minimum payment on my student loans (~6%) interest, and max out my retirement contributions because at the end of the day our the gains from that account will far outweigh the cost of the interest.

The advice in the sidebar links says
&gt; A common argument is that the long-term return from investments in the stock market will likely exceed the interest rate from a low-interest loan. While this has been true in the past, keep in mind that paying down a loan is a guaranteed return at the loan's interest rate. Stock performance is anything but guaranteed. Fairly common consensus is that loans above 4% interest should be paid off in the debt reduction phase, while anything under that can be stretched out.

Is there more of an explanation than there's volatility in the market?

A few details about my situation are I'm mid-twenties, employer matches 5% and I'm currently contributing 8%, Student loan is about 25k @ ~6-7% interest. Should I cut back on retirement contributions to 5%, then avalanche the shit out of my student loans?

CryptoCurrency,"Karma (KARM) has thought about the legal implications of ""securities"" from the beginning of Karmashares LLC","A cryptocurrency-based model for raising capital that has considered the legal implications of ""securities"" from the beginning is [Karmashares](http://karmashares.com), based on [Karma](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaTeam/) (KARM).

Our model is a member-managed LLC. Why is a member-managed LLC important? As the code of civil procedure for our state says:

&gt;(F) If the offering is of stock or shares (other than preferred stock or shares) and except as otherwise required by law, the securities have voting rights at least equal to the securities of each of the issuer's outstanding classes of stock or shares (other than preferred stock or shares), with respect to the number of votes per share and the right to vote on the same general corporate decisions

Through our proof-of-coin (PoC) model, our members (owners) all have voting rights and have votes and  participate in the active management of the LLC through voting, so this may not affect us. We are also building a layer on top of our blockchain that will make management of the LLC even easier (and weight of member votes according to their interest in the LLC).

What is a security?

&gt;The term “security” is broadly defined to include the expected stocks, bonds, etc., but also includes interests in pyramid sales schemes and even interests in the development of citrus orchards. The latter two examples are securities because they are “investment contracts”. 

&gt;In 1946, the U.S. Supreme Court held in SEC v W.J. Howey Co. (328 U.S. 293) that an investment in a transaction or a scheme where a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of others is an investment contract, and therefore, a security. This test has been since used and interpreted extensively by the courts. It is this test that a lawyer should use when determining whether an interest in a limited partnership, general partnership, limited liability partnership or a limited liability company is a security.

&gt;The Howey test can be summarized as follows: passive investments, where investors do not have any decision-making power and just invest their money, are securities; whereas investments made by the principals, who are actively involved in the management of the enterprise, are not securities. So, limited partnership interests are generally securities because limited partners rely on the general partners to manage the partnership, unless they preserve some veto power, in which case the “investment contract” test would not be met. [...]

&gt;**If the LLC is member-managed, then each member is involved in management of the enterprise and has decision-making powers, and therefore their interests would generally not be securities.** On the other hand, if the LLC is manager-managed, then members are just passive investors, and their interests are likely to be securities.

(from [here](http://www.businesslawpost.com/2010/06/are-lp-gp-llp-and-llc-interests.html))

Although LLC interests do not appear in the definition of the federal securities laws and of most states we are anticipating more thorough legal counsel on the matter for our particular organization.

personalfinance,Advice on Graduate Loans,"Hey PF! First of, just wanted to say this is a great subreddit with great info. Just looking for some advice, and I think I have it figured out but it would be great to get a second opinion.

So here's the situation, I'm a Physician Assistant student entering the 2nd year of my 3 year program. I was fortunate enough to have my parents pay my 1st year to tuition but will now be responsible for my last 2 years. My only debt right now is $5,000 from Stafford @ 5.41% I took out to help pay for rent and other miscellaneous things during my first year. I've been looking into loan options for paying my 2nd and 3rd year. With tuition being about $48k/yr I'll probably end up taking out around $55k/yr for included rent and other miscellaneous things. My plan for my upcoming year is to take the full Stafford loan of $20,500 @5.41% and the remaining $34.5k in private loans and do that again for my 3rd year.

So my question is, does it makes sense to mix federal and private? Seeing as how the max Stafford I can take out is $20,500 @5.41% and if I want to stay with federal I would have to do the Grad Plus @6.41% along with their gigantic 4.488% origination fee. I went and looked at Private Loan options from Sallie Mae, Discover, Citizen's Bank and see the options of Fixed Rate at around 6% and variable between 2.5%-7.5% with no origination fees and all offering interest rewards of 0.25% for autopay and Discover having a 1% cash bonus for good grades. Obviously the rates I would get would depend on my credit score and if I have a co-signer. My current score is 770 and my parents have a pretty good credit score as well, so there's a strong possibility of being able to secure a low variable rate.

The only real pro for the federal loans I see is the different repayment plans and are a bit more forgiving in repayment options in case of any type of emergency with my job situation, but other than that with the high interest rate of the Grad Plus and the origination fee, it's definitely not ideal.

So to be safe, I was thinking of doing the Stafford + a Variable Private Loan. Given my credit score and my parents who would probably agree to co-sign with me + the 0.25% auto-debit reward, I'm hoping to get a a variable around 4-5%, which is significantly better than the Grad Plus' 6.41%.

By the end of it, I'm looking at a Principal of about $115k by the time I'm done. My goal is to pay off the loans within 5 years, and after doing some rough math, monthly payments come out to about $2,100/month. My expected salary after graduation in my area will probably be low $90k to low 6 figures depending if I go into ER or Orthopedics. I think the $2,100/month loan payments is doable, seeing as how my car is payed off and I'll be living with my girlfriend so we'll split rent and things.
So how does that plan sound? Sorry that it's a long read, wanted to make sure I provided enough info for everything. Thanks for any input!",finance,1401953394
personalfinance,Financial Advice to make a good situation better,"I really enjoy this subreddit, and think you're all doing God's work here in helping people avoid predatory lenders, become financially solvent, and get themselves out of difficult positions.  I lurk often, and think the general level of advice here is laudable.  I wondered if I might ask for some advice as well, since my situation is somewhat unique.

First off, the first thing most people advocate is an emergency fund, but I've not invested heavily in one.  I have a very secure position with tenure, and it also provides my housing and extensive health care coverage. The common emergencies (medical, property-related, unemployment) are not concerns for me, and I don't know if budgeting for them is the best idea.  A car accident could cause some significant bills, but I'm not overly worried about it.  I walk to work, and anticipate doing so for a while -- the car is just for fun.

I have about $40k of student debt in a few smaller loans with reasonable interest rates, $10k left on a car loan, and $10k in consumer debt left over from lean college and grad school years.  

After maxing out my TSP contribution, paying all my bills and minimums, paying into my IRA and covering basics like food, I have ~$4k/mo. to put toward whatever purpose I choose.

For the last 6 months, I've been paying down consumer debt and the car loan, and I've taken care of $20k there.  I intend to continue to pay down credit cards until I carry no debt there, but then I am at an impasse.  I have a baby daughter coming in a few months, and I want some financial cushion there.  I should also start saving something towards her college expenses.  Furthermore, I'd like to own a home that I could use as a rental property when I'm not living there (I'd spend 2-3 years there, then 2-10 years away.)

I'd like some advice on how substantial an emergency fund I should maintain (given the relative security of my life and income) and where you think I should invest, after maxing out IRA and TSP contributions.  Should I start putting money toward a house somewhere?  If so, should I just leave that money in a checking account?

Any advice is appreciated.  I'd like to start making smart decisions now, as I'm in a good position to be glad I did later.",finance,1401958921
Bitcoin,Crazy / creative idea to separate Dollar and Bitcoin economies.,"Just an idea from a crazy creative person. Say you really want to go after the Fed. What if you prized goods in an outrageously high prize, say a handful of strawberries for 10 bitcoin, in order to separate Bitcoin and Dollars, to create a separate economy?

I know what you are going to say, no one is going to pay that prize. But then I'd say, well, apparently you don't believe in Bitcoin, you're still a Dollar whore (no offense). 

It's a way to separate the wheat from the chaff. You just have to be sure that you're buying the strawberries from an honest Bitcoin enthusiast (you have to know the person) as to be assured that he or she won't trade those Bitcoin for Dollars. 

People need to start offering every bit of skill they have for Bitcoin, in order to strengthen its economy, without making comparisons to the Dollar economy. And people should be generous in spending their Bitcoins. For instance if you know that 'Danner' makes good boots, you shouldn't tell people for free, but you should instead ask 10 Bitcoin for the advice. That way you make sure that Dollar holders won't receive that advice, thereby weakening the Dollar economy and strengthen the Bitcoin one.",cryptocurrency,1401966768

I've just graduated, and landed my first job.  I'm looking at 42k of student loans, with an interest rate pegged at inflation.  This is typically 2-3% I've been told.  

My salary is 105k, and my rent/car is paid for.  Built into my yearly tax is a mandatory repayment equal to 8% of my gross income, so roughly $8400.  There is a bonus to paying the debt off early, in the form of a 5% bonus to any lump sum repayments you make.  For example, pay $1000 into this loan and $1050 will be subtracted.

My question is, should I blast my loans down in one year, or pay the minimum repayment over 4.5 years, and use the rest to invest elsewhere?

personalfinance,Where should my debt-payment focus be?,"I apologize in advance if this is not PF-worthy. This is something with which I have a daily struggle in my mind, and I'm looking for other angles before I make a decision.

I'm looking to pay off all of my debt over the next 12 months or so, including my vehicle loan. I presently have $5,000+ in savings, most of which I'm willing to make a lump sum payment into whatever the wisest decision is. Usually I can pay at least $500 from every paycheck (bi-weekly) toward my debt, though I am coming into a raise shortly, and overtime allows for larger payments. Here is my debt situation:

* Card 1 - $2,000 - 0% until May, 2015 (11 mos)
* Credit Card 2 - $12,000 - 0% until September, 2015 (15 mos)
* Vehicle Loan - $8,200 -$497 monthly, 1.5% interest, ends November 2015 (17 mos)

My struggle comes in where the vehicle is a huge psychological load on my shoulders. The $497/mo payment gets cut in half and taken out of my 2 monthly paychecks, and put into an account for my fixed payments (house, car, phone, insurance) that I don't touch. I feel as though if I pay off the car, free up $250 per check (permanently, basically resulting in a $6,500 pay raise), I will be able to better pay off my credit cards, and even allot more to savings. At the same time, it seems mostly useless to pay off a 1.5% loan when I have nearly $14,000 in rotating credit that some day will hit outrageous interest rates if they are not paid off. 

I know that people wiser than I, with more experience than I, can lend me some insight. Thanks for your time.",finance,1401974646

personalfinance,7/1 vs 10/1 ARM vs 30 Year Fixed?,"I finally had an offer accepted in Boston! (seems like a difficult thing to accomplish in this market). I am debating whether to take a loan that's:

* 30 year fixed, 4.125% with 0 points (No PMI - I'm putting 20% down)
* 10/1 hybrid ARM 3.625% with 0 points (No PMI - I'm putting 20% down)
* 7/1 hybrid ARM 3.25% with 0 points (No PMI - I'm putting 20% down)

My thought was that if I did to the ARM, I would apply any resulting lower payment amount vs the 30 year and apply it to principle. So with the 7 year ARM, I would be applying approximately $200 extra to principle. After the 7 years, I would end up being $20k ahead equity-wise over the 30 year fixed. At this point, I would try to refinance to a 15 year mortgage, which would mean my overall loan duration would be 22 years instead of 30. A flaw in my assessment would be that a 15 year loan in 7 years could have a substantially higher interest rate than today (figure, over 4%). Another risk would be if my property depreciates in value. Does r/pf have any insight? The 30 year fixed does seem like one of the best deals in this country, however.",finance,1401979438

I was expecting this to happen in October (when I submit my 2013 tax returns for IBR), but it seems to have happened yesterday, dropping all my interest rate!

Aside from investments, we have about $42k sitting in cash at the moment although we normally do not keep that much in cash.  Here's the situation:

* I have a decent credit score (725).  
* Awesome family who are willing to help with initial costs like a cheap vehicle, security deposit on an apt, etc.

Downsides:

* No real savings, I've been living off student loans and financial aid.  Depending on how much of my deposit I get back I'll have around $500-800 and a credit card with $2000 limit
* No transportation
* I have until the 17th to find a place to live
* My job needs me to start on the 16th
* Family is several hours away, difficult to get help moving anything

However I am having a lot of trouble deciding what to do moving forward.

* Option A) studio apartment for 1000-1100 within walking distance of my job, no car


* Option B) shared apartment for 700-800 within walking distance of my job, no car

* Option C) Studio in a cheaper area for 700-800, but need car or very long bus ride every day (~1hr)

* Option D) Sublet one of the many places open during summer for ~600 in a shared room, less permanent in case the job doesn't work out, but probably need transportation

I'm having trouble weighing the overall cost of a vehicle combined with a cheaper, farther away place because I don't know how to estimate it.

Any help, advice, or thoughts on my situation is welcome.

Edit: I know the smartest financial decision is the cheapest housing possible, suck up any negatives, take the bus, build savings.  But I do place value on privacy, the feeling of being 'settled' instead of having to move again after sublet, and not having to share a room after 2 years of triples and doubles.

personalfinance,"Student Loans, good idea?Taking More than I need and paying back what I don't use","I was wondering if this is a good idea (and apologies in advance if this is a terrible idea)...

 I am eligible to receive 42K in in student loans. I calculated and will likely only need 8-10K for my program. I did my sums and will only need to take a loan for last year of the program. I was wondering is it a terrible idea to take the maximum loan, invest it in a high interest savings account or CD, and when I graduate pay back the money I did not use (conservatively lets say it's $32K) and start the process of repaying the outstanding $10K. The loan is broken up in two parts, 32K at 6.41% and 20K at 5.41%. Obviously I will spend the lower interest rate loan first, and don't anticipate that I will need to spend anything from the higher interest rate loan.

Here is my reasoning:

1. Taking the excess minimizes my risk while going to school. If I do get laid off I don't have to quit or postpone my studies, instead, I become a full time student. Admittedly I will then assume a much bigger debt load but in practice what I will likely do is find another job. Having the extra funds might give me breathing room to do so.
2. If I have the money, why not invest it in a high yield savings account? I would likely do this anyway even if I only took the smallest possible loan.

Risks:

1. I cannot maintain fiscal discipline to not spend the money I don't strictly need. This would be a huge mistake and I have to put it down as a possibility despite my declared intentions not to do this.
2. Tax burden, it is unclear to me what the tax burden might be. Although all I can think of is a tax on the interest accrued.
3. Violates terms of loan. From my reading it does not seem to be the case (might consult with a professional however).

They're conservative, but may return even less than bonds while not being liquid. So are they not practical enough for most typical investors' portfolios, or is there something subtle I'm missing?

I need $10,000 and am thinking about going through Navy Fed. I applied for an auto loan with them in 2012 and got approved, however I needed a cosigner and had a high interest rate so I ended up not taking out that loan.

I've had a credit card with them since November 2013, $3000 limit. I've been employed since March 2013 and make about $1800/mo. My credit score is 690 (Credit Karma), probably because of my short history. No late payments or anything. 

What do you think my chances are of getting approved? I'd take it out for 36 months, and would have no problem paying it back by then, if not sooner. 

I'm not a fan of loans/debt, but I'm at the point that I can look at this as an investment in getting my career going.

I'm 21, have no student loans or any other debt. 

What do you think my chances are of getting approved?

personalfinance,First time financing a car.,"I've bought cars before, but I've never needed to finance them. After my most recent car kicked the bucket after a slurry of mechanical issues, I decided it's time to buy a newer model of car. 

The only problem is I really have no credit history. I've tried many times to acquire credit cards through my bank (which I've had an account with for 10 years), credit unions, and stores (like Khols, Banana Republic, etc.), but was repeatedly denied. Recently someone turned me on to Capital One and they worked with me to get a very very small secured line credit card, but there hasn't been enough time to build any credit history with it. 

I'm looking at cars that are around $15,000 after dealer fees and such, but even putting $5000 as a downpayment the best interest rate they're willing to give me 19% with ~$350 monthly payments, which is a bit more than I'd prefer to pay. Of course, they site my lack of credit history as an issue with getting a loan, and I also have no co-signer.

Basically what I'm asking is if anyone has suggestions for a way I can find lower interest rates? I asked my bank already about getting a car loan directly from them and they denied me.",finance,1402000844
personalfinance,Question about paying back closed credit card balances,"I'm 26 years old and I have old credit card debt. I was homeless for a while after graduating college and ruined my credit to keep myself afloat. Now that I've had a steady job for a year, I want to find out what I can actually do to take care of the debt or any recommended steps.


Here are my outstanding balances:

BOA credit card - $980 (closed and in collections)*


Fifth Third credit card - $800 (closed and in collections)*


Capital One credit card - $800 (closed moved to collection agency)


Amazon store credit card - $530 (closed by amazon, balance = $0)


Barclaycard credit card - $880 (still works, use it occasionally)



Not sure if the bank is still holding the debt *


So yesterday while I was calling around trying to find info, the Amazon card struck me as odd. Apparently Amazon closed my credit card (no surprise), but there wasn't a balance to pay off. It should have been $530, but the lady kept telling me it was at $0. After pushing further, they told me that the balance was written off, and that it was assumed I wouldn't pay them back. Now for the next 7 years it will be on my credit report. I was miffed because I want to get my credit in good shape, but now I have this unremovable stain on my credit.

The big question is then, since that Amazon balance was cleared off and it looks bad on my credit anyway now, what's stopping me from calling the other banks/card companies/collections and telling them that I will not be paying off any of the existing balances? 

What I'm saying is, am I screwed for 7 years no matter what? And why should I pay off the remaining~ $2500 anyway? Won't it all go away in 7 years anyway? It's not like I have $20,000+ credit card debt...

Will my credit ever get any better in that time? I was hoping to get a car next year, and I might have to lease or finance (unless I get a raise).

I make $36,000 a year, live in CA, and have about $3000 saved up. I also still have 1 credit card (29.9%) that still works and has a $1000 limit.

TAKE HOME: ~$2,000 every other week, $940 on the 10th of every month

Healthcare, 401k, FSA comes out of my check before I see it.  


Expenses:

Mortgage: ~$1870/month (includes property tax, home insurance escrow)

Car payment: $460/month.  I owe $10k still and the interest rate is 6.99%.  WHY?!

Car insurance: $95/month

CC: minimum is like $40/month, I budget $175 and pay at least that.  Balance is $1200 and I would like this paid off ASAP.  Interest is a crazy 14%.

H20: $60/month

PG&amp;E: +/- $40 month

Trash collection: $13/month

Daughter's summer camp/daycare: $340/month

Student loans: $200/month, total balance is $10k, average interest is 2.75% (graduated in the early 2000s and got lucky)

Netflix/Hulu: $16/month

What would you attack first?  I would like to knock out the rest of the CC, and should be able to fairly easily.  This will free up a bit of outgoing $$ (this is the last of a LONG, LONG road of CC repayment).  Student loans have smaller balances, but very low fixed interest rates.  It would be gratifying and freeing to pay them off though and have fewer debts hanging over my head.

The car.  If I only pay the minimum, I'd have about 2 years left.  It was originally a 5 year loan.  I am not upside down - slightly above breaking even.  I have learned that the interest rate is much too high (credit score: 843, last time I checked).  Do I trade it in now, pay off the loan, get something else?  It has 110,000 miles and I will likely want to trade it in because my family is growing and it's a small sedan (Acura TSX).  Should I pay it off and then sell it?  Trade it in now, probably break even, finance something that better suits my needs at a lower interest rate?

Because of hospital bills, credit cards, and student loan payments, we were sinking fast.  So we decided to withdraw from my 401(k).  (I know, horrible move, but we were desperate.)  I set up a Roth IRA and did the necessary hoop-jumping to withdraw 50% of the 401(k) (minus federal withholding) and roll over the other half.  I had the withdrawal direct-deposited into my bank account, and had a check cut for the other half to go to the Roth IRA, which I would then mail in with all my signed paperwork.

A few days later, we got the direct deposit... *for the full amount* minus the federal withholding.  So I was like ""Oh, I guess I misunderstood and I'm supposed to write the check from the account.""

""Extremely important"" would actually be an understatement. I quote ""Winning the Losers Game"" by Charles Ellis:


&gt;Time – the length of time investments will be held and the period of time over which investment results will be measured and judged is the single most powerful factor in any investment program


So, what makes time this important? Well, for starters - the time value of money. It's a central concept in finance theory, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Combine this with financial derivatives and the sky is the limit.


Now, when it comes to cryptocurrencies, these derivatives aren't there (yet). Fortunately, cryptos are so volatile that it can still give you crazy returns. Zero dollar at risk and a chance at a return of 80% annually? Sure, why not. Bitcoin grew to its current value over the past five years, Dogecoin could perhaps end up the same in the next five who knows. If prices go up tenfold in five years, you can still get 16% annually. But how? Package it! All you need is a certificate of deposit (CD) and some coins in a cold wallet and you're set. [Go check out the details here.](http://dogeconomist.com/packaging_cryptocurrency_investments/)


I don't want to summarize it, as this is advanced financial stuff used for the most complicated financial products available. Just adding a disclaimer. I've provided a very prudent example. Interest rates might be higher depending on your country. A longer horizon will typically yield a higher interest rate. Five years is the most common investment horizon. There are other ways to spice up the discount rate, I will not discuss this in public. As stated: Please consult your personal financial advisor for questions on the appropriateness of any of these ideas discussed.


TL;DR: If you want invest in Dogecoin without any anxiety you should probably read it all.

Edit: Here is a very simple example to capture the main idea. Imagine you want to invest $105. You can get 5% interest at a bank on a 1-year CD (highest yield). In one year, you will have $105 if you put $100 in the CD. That means that right now you have $5 left. You use this to buy DOGE. If the $5 doubles, you will get $105 (CD) + $10 (DOGE), almost 10% return on the original amount of $105. And if it goes up a hundred times.. well... moon. Worst case you receive $105. By putting it in a CD, you commit to the horizon - no more need to worry about price.",cryptocurrency,1402085724

I could really use some advice on how to get my debt under control enough that my wife can move out and we can enjoy a trial separation (to find out if we should divorce or get back together).  We both make about the same amount of money which is enough to live comfortably, but we accrued a shit-ton of credit card debt in the past couple years while trying to have fun with each other.  Now we just want to get rid of that debt and start over fresh.  We cut up the credit cards a couple months ago, when we decided it was not working out and we wanted to separate.  We have also reduced spending everywhere possible, just buying basic groceries and what the kid needs, and putting the rest toward debt and savings.  Without those credit card minimum payments we should have enough income to live separately comfortably.

**Income:** I make around $40k/yr gross and get paid bi-weekly.  Wife makes around $32k/yr gross and gets paid on the first of each month.  All of the family’s insurance (me, wife, and kid) comes out of my check so we end up bringing home about the same amount.  

**Savings:** very little in savings, like a grand total.  We both have a 401k but there’s probably not enough to borrow or whatever.

**Debt:**

Credit card 1: $7,000 (I think about 18% interest rate)

Credit card 2: $10,000 (I think about 12% interest rate)

House: minimum payment is about $600/month and we have only about $8,000 equity.  We were super happy with 5% interest rate when we bought in 2009, but now I know I can get 4% or better.  She said I can have the house if I take over all the credit card debt.  I got quotes on refinancing, but after closing costs I wouldn’t come away with any money, just a slightly lower monthly payment.

Vehicle 1: wife’s car, minimum payment is $400/month and probably very little equity if any.

Vehicle 2: my truck, minimum payment is $340/month and I have close to $5,000 equity.  I’m considering downgrading to an older model with no payments.

Vehicle 3: motorcycle, we own it outright and could probably sell for $3,500 as an absolute last resort (but I sure do enjoy riding it, and it’s far cheaper on gas).

Student loans: minimum payment is around $150/month and I don’t know how much she owes.  She wants me to take half this debt, but I’m reluctant of course.

**Summary:**

My main concern is paying down our debt and getting an apartment for her for a six month period.  Rent in the area is around $600/month for the lowest acceptable quality (we have a kid to consider), plus utilities.  Neither of us has family or friends that can take us in temporarily and we can’t really stand to be in the same house much longer.  I realize we were dumb by racking up the debt, and I realize we shouldn’t be worrying about a second rent or whatever, but this is the best option we can come up with at the moment to move forward.  We both have very good credit scores, if that matters for anything.  Neither of us is in a place to get a second job.  She is going to school and we both work full time.  And when we end up living separately, it’ll be even tougher to find the time for a second job while spitting custody.

**Questions:** 

*Is there an easy way to get rid of that credit card debt quicker?  We’ve done the 0% transfer and we’ve paid extra on the principle but it’s still taking way too long.

*Should I sell my truck and get something cheap (like a Ford Ranger that I can buy outright with the equity) or make the last 14 payments until I own it?

*What should I do with the house?  Refinance for a lower monthly payment, sell and hope for a profit, stay put and keep making payments?

*Should I consider taking the house and the credit card debt, or split both 50/50?

*Any additional advice on how to fairly split up our debt and ultimately get rid of the debt would be helpful.  I am really hoping reddit can come through so we don’t have to get a lawyer involved.",finance,1402085970
personalfinance,"Just graduated college, looking for student loan/investment advice","Hello all,

As the title suggests I just graduated from college about a week ago and have approx $30k in loans to pay ($2800 through US bank and the rest through the federal gov). I am already working full time so I might as well start now, right? 

After tax, retirement and all other expected vital expenses (rent, food, gas, auto insurance, etc.) I will have about $1600 per month for personal expenses, savings, investments, and paying off those loans.

I am seeking any advice on how I should allocate that remaining $1500 each month, should I pay off the loans as quickly as possible, or make modest payments and use the rest of the money to invest? The subsidized loans have interest around 3.5-4.5% and the unsubsidized have about a 6.8% interest rate. I don't know about the US bank one, I have to get access to my account. 

My current, not-though out plan would be to allocate about $800/month until I pay off all of the US bank and unsubsidized ones, then tone that down a bit when only the subsidized ones remain. I would allocate about $400 per month towards savings/investments. And have about $400 for personal expenses (there will likely be plenty leftover which I would put in savings).

Also I don't really know where to start when it comes to setting up payment plans for these loans so any knowledge or advice on that too would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",finance,1402086408
personalfinance,I need some help; I feel buried. Can PF review my situation and lend me a hand?,"Hey PF.


About me: I am a 22 year old IT guy working for a small (4 employee) franchise system. The business is great and I love my position in the company.


My credit is ruined. I went to ITT Technical Institute shortly out of high school (sigh…, let’s not go there today). I did not graduate, however I did attend for a year and a half before I was dropped for non-attendance. This has racked me up a sizable amount of debt in private loans, which I have since defaulted on. 

Current private student loan debt – $26,000
Current federal student loan debt - $11,000


That’s right, $37,000 for no degree. I am floating around a 575 credit score and my only open line of credit is a Secured MasterCard with a $250 limit that I got around 3 months ago. I have been putting between $30 and $100 on this per month and paying it off in full.

My private student loans are in default, which means for the full length of the payoff process I will remain at a 0% interest rate; which is good, I guess. My federal loans are averaging about 5.2% between 5 groups. I just made arrangements with my private loans to make $200/month payments for the foreseeable future and my federal loans come out of forbearance next month.


I am also paying back Unemployment Overpayment, a car payment, and some medical bills from an ER trip without insurance. My minimum monthly payments look like this:

Unemployment – $112.34

Car Payment - $140

Capital One Card - ~$50

Federal Student Loan - $127.34

Private Student Loan - $200

Medical Bills - $98.09



**Totals:**

Unemployment – $874.95

Car Payment - $3296.93

Capital One Card - $0

Federal Student Loan - $25696.93

Private Student Loan - $11608.91

Medical Bills - $1424.21



Now, back to my job; I make decent money for my age I guess. I’m currently at $24/hr after a recent raise. With overtime and bonus’s I’m looking right around $60k/year. I’ve been with the company for nearly 3 years now, starting out at a meager $17/hr so progression within the company is very nice.


Many of you will also hate me for this, but I also have 2.0 Bitcoin’s in an offline wallet that my cost basis is ~$515/coin. Currently they are trading for ~$650/coin so I have made a profit there.

My question to you all is simple, how do I start digging myself out of this hole? Do sell my Bitcoins and pay off my Unemployment or Medical bills?

I have a budget; I’m not good at this budget. I can send you all a link to it, but basically; my snowball income is around $200/month. I want to live more frugally, but it is difficult for me since I can’t seem to convince myself of the long term good it would do. I much rather take my girlfriend out to eat, or a movie, or have a social life of some sort, than to put that money towards huge balances.

personalfinance,Smartest Private Student Loan Options,"Although I know that debt is the scourge of the Earth in this thread it is unfortunately my smartest option. My family and I filed for the FAFSA and based on our income qualified for Stafford and Parent Plus. However, my parents believe it is my responsibility to pay for the majority of my education and therefore will not accept the Plus loan. However, they agreed to cosign for me, as they understand it's the only way for me to not get absolutely slammed with a high interest rate.

Background Information: I am attending Michigan State University with in-state tuition. My major is chemical engineering and to offset the cost of things I plan on co-oping / interning during the summer. My family and I use 53 as our bank of choice, and taking a look at private loans we're looking at Sallie Mae/ 53 (The partner together), The MSU federal credit union (if I get accepted, I know they have the ""soft pull on credit""), and Nelnet. 

I've heard alot of bad things about Sallie Mae, but also some good things as well. Nelnet is very highly rated and is flexible about payment options, and credit unions also allow soft pulls on credit instead of hard. Any other alternatives would be appreciated. I understand that taking out a loan in the first place is not the best move and I'm looking for the least painful option. Thank you.",finance,1402088116

personalfinance,"reducing income for 1 year, please help with budget!","Please forgive me for this, I feel like I'm just needing to type everything out to get a handle on it. SUPER LONG.

Backstory: I'm having a baby. In July, I'm reducing my hours by 20%. In September, we have a nanny coming in to watch the baby when I go back to work. We have to get through a year on my reduced pay and the high cost of childcare.

The details:

Combined net income: $5740/month, husband and me

Expenses:

* Student loans: $400 (some private, some federal)
* Credit card debt: roughly $600 spread over 4 cards -- that's the minimum payments
* Cell phones -- $220. I have AT&amp;T, husband has Verizon. Not sure if we should pay to break his contract so that we can roll this together
* Auto lease -- $340
* Car loan -- $200. This is an estimate; we haven't bought the car yet
* Auto insurance -- no idea. Currently paying $111, but we got into a fender bender AND are being sued, so I have no idea what this will go up to. Oh, and we're adding the second car.
* Child care -- $2000

Total expenses: $4020, but this could go up depending on car insurance premium increase

Balance: $1720

Variables:

* medical costs. We have a high-deductible plan, which I am open to changing if recommended. We will have to meet a $4000 threshold before costs are covered.

* car insurance. See above.

* car repairs. In the fender bender, we never fixed our own car to avoid the expense, but this will absolutely have to be done at some point

* end of lease. The car that was in the fender bender is up in January. We will have to buy the car because of the damage and mileage overage. So, we'll need to come up with at least some kind of down payment. The car will cost about $14,000.

* taxes. We currently owe $1900 for 2011 taxes....the IRS corrected something on our return. We might be able to do a payment plan, though that will affect our bottom line month-to-month. In addition, we had a short sale in 2013 that will mean we'll owe taxes this year, but we don't know how much yet.

* savings. As of the end of the summer, we will have $2400 in savings, which we'd like to hold onto to make sure we can cover misc. expenses month to month, but I'm willing to use this to pay down debt if that's recommended.

We're good at being frugal with stuff like groceries, gas, clothes, etc. We have a 6-year-old who needs to do stuff like take swim lessons and go to birthday parties.

personalfinance,Not straight forward financial situation. What to do?,"So my GF and I are have been together for years and are engaged.  We make about 100k together before taxes and each take in about 2800 a month, so thats about 5600 per month together.  Issue is she has 340k in debt, 40k of which is private and the 300k is public federal student loans.  The interest rates of these loans are bad. 7-9%


So in 2 years my salary should bump to around 200-250k, hers will bump eventually to around there as well, but this will be in about 5 years.

approx 200 /mo transportation.

Right now we are saving 2.5k per month for a wedding we are planning next year.  I also expect a inheritance soon of about 30k, which i plan on paying off her private loan with.  Cant use this 30k for the wedding because there is no guarantee as to when the estate will be closed, so it could be after the wedding.  


The question.  Once her private loan is payed off, we can continue IBR and go for loan forgiveness in 20 years having to pay whatever taxes are left on the forgiven amount

OR

PSLF program, she should have 3-6 years at the end of her training and would only require 7-4 more, This program does not require you to pay taxes on the forgiven amount and is clearly superior.

financialindependence,Substantial hike in income - what should I do with it?,"About a month ago I started a new job and my income has grown from just above minimum wage with different hours each week, averaging about $1k/month, to salaried at $37k/year (before taxes). I let myself slack off and go wild on my first paycheck and purchase some things that I'd been eyeing for a while and took some of my good friends out to a nice dinner, but now I need to start getting serious and buckle down. My first order of business is definitely to pay off my debts like my ass is on fire, but what do I do with my extra income after that? I've got a bunch of different goals and have no idea where to start or what the most financially savvy route would be (and honestly investing scares me a little).

My stats:
23 years old, single, no kids, one cat.

Monthly bills:

* Rent: $100/mo (currently living with parents, but hoping to buy a house soon)
* Car: $215/mo loan, $147/mo insurance, and average $150/mo gas
* Phone: charged by usage, but averages $20/mo
* Food/Treats/Flea meds for cat: averages $20/mo

My mom is gracious enough to include groceries, utilities, etc in my rent, so no other bills.
TOTAL: $632/mo avg


Debt:

* Car: currently $9,585 @ 3.4%
* Credit Cards: about $50 each on 2 cards, but I pay them in full at the end of each cycle
* Settlement from breaking previous apt. lease: $600 (planning on paying this IN FULL on my next paycheck because I stupidly let it lapse into collections and now it's on my credit statement OOPS)

TOTAL: $10,285

Savings: $50 (sad, I know, but it's better than $0 I guess ...)

I have looked into selling my car to get one that doesn't need monthly payments and at this point if I did I would be upside down on it and end up owing the bank money, so I don't feel like that's really an option. I also feel like the interest rate is pretty good, but I could be wrong.

Goals:

1. Pay off Apt. collections debt and car loan
2. Purchase a home hopefully within the next 6 months to 1 year. I do have it good living low rent, but my new commute is 25 mi each way and I definitely want to live closer to work (hopefully within 5 mi). In the area I'm looking at an older 2-3 bedroom house with about 900-1,000 sq ft range anywhere from $80k-120k depending on how much work they need, so that's what I'm looking for.
3. Reach FI somewhere in the 40 to 45 year old range (about 20 years from now). Once I reach FI I'd like to just stay home and work on my house and tend a huge vegetable garden and maybe have a couple chickens and a fish pond. Pretty much just chill out for the rest of my life.

I do need to pay off the car, but I feel like the interest rate is low enough that I should keep making payments until I get my credit score back up to make it easier to get a good rate on a mortgage (unless I'm missing something). So what order do I go in? Do I pay off the car like it's hot potatoes, then save for a house, then start looking into investing? Or do I keep making payments, dip into investing, and worry about a house later? Or some combination thereof?

personalfinance,Would enjoy some advice. (Wall of text),"Hello all, Forgive me for the wall of text, **tdlr below**. 

I'm 25, male and single. I've never been good with personal finances, or put much thought into them, I've also never talked to an advisor about it either and I've only dabbled in documentation on how to create a budget and save money, however much of the information I read contradicts my outlook on life. A lot of the information says ""Save for retirement using a 401k"", ""Save for X months incase you don't have a job"", ""Save money by living closer to work"", or ""cut costs by removing unnecessary things in life"". While all of these ideas are the obvious answer to becoming debt free and save money, a lot of this information fails to explain on how to continue having a social life or do anything but count your money. 

While the story below provides some detail of my spending habit. I'll provide some more here; I currently am making 60,000 dollars a year, whoopse, first time I've told someone that. Now, i'm really getting an estimated 4,100 after taxes and at the end of the month I have around 300-400 left, which I spend some how? When I add everything on paper, I'm spending about 3,500 a month. I'm not a big spender, I hardly by new things unless I can completely justify it. I typically use hand-me-down clothing or lurk around the local thrift shop for new(old) things. My food mostly comes from fast food I believe I spend between 5-15 dollars a day total for food. My fuel cost are around 200-300 a month depending if I get adventurous. The place I live in is almost bare, I have a bed which I bought a few years back and a sofa which was provided to me last year. My roommate provides entertainment with a television hooked up to a computer.  Most weekends I spend outdoors playing disc golf or something similar, usually spend minimal amount of money. Now my spending habits are pretty bland too, if sometime costs more then 50$ I will typically think about it for a few days, or if it's pretty expensive and pretty useless I'll see if I want it in 2-3 months then order it. I'm not a person who shows off money or even says how much money I have. 

Question 1: While, I believe saving for retirement is vital to surviving when you are older I can't seem to start my own 401k or retirement fund. I also am not fond of the idea of a 401k. While providing someone money every paycheck and getting it back when I'm of age with XX% more money does seem pretty awesome. I don't like the idea of not being able to use that money (without penalties) until I am of age.

What would be a viable option for me to save money for retirement. I've considered opening a high interest savings account, however banks with these typically require X0,000+ dollars to open. Which I'm currently unable to do. I've also considered using CDs, however the interest rates on these are very minimal and almost not worth the effort. I've also thought of testing my luck in the stock market, with a savings account on the side incase that fails. However I've never been sure where to start, who to go with, or what to do. I'm wondering what would be some alternatives to saving for retirement? Would it be a good idea to open a savings account with a different bank to prevent myself from always seeing that money when I look at my funds? While I understand there is no best option, I'm just looking for some ideas and when it would be best to start (I'm not looking for ""save now, you'll thank yourself later"" responses.). Is it better once you can have X money at the end of the month, or is really better to start when you are having trouble getting by?

Question 2: Creating a budget, I've tired multiple times, I've always failed at maintaining the budget. I've tried using mint.com as a budget panner. I've also tried using the bank simple. I love the interface that they provide and the graphs of the money flow are pretty neat. However, I have a hard time keeping up on categorizing the items I buy, both on mint and simple. Most the time it I'll buy a 2-3 dollar drink from the Gas Station, or I'll pick up some 2-3$ food item from the local fast food joint once or twice a day. My subconscious tells me ""oh it's two dollars, not a big deal"" but obviously this adds up over time. The information I read online says ""make food at home, bring it to work"", while I'd love to do this I have absolutely no cooking skills or ambition to learn, I even lack the memory of placing some food in the microwave. Typically, when I get hungry again I find myself getting something new to place in the radiation chamber and then seeing that I already did that a few hours earlier.

As seen, I'm spending around 3,500 dollars a month. To me, this seems excessive... How am I spending this much, while I see the money I'm spending I can't comprehend how this happened. Even though I'm making a fair amount of money, I still feel as if I'm living paycheck to paycheck with a tiny it of leeway. As I mentioned earlier, one of the recommendations I've read says ""live closer to work"". While it's possible for me to live down the street from my job, this is not ideal for me as it is in a rough neighborhood. I've seen various muggings and ridiculous driving from people. To me, finances are not worth living in a rough neighborhood. While many of the boarder neighborhoods are nicer with less crime, these are raising in crime at a monthly basis. This means that I live about 15-20 miles from my work for my daily commute and I've recently purchased a vehicle with much better fuel milage then my previous car. While this car is rather expensive, I've justified it by the requirements I wanted in a car. (Good fuel milage, awd, comfortable seating, (hopefully good) resale value). Since moving is out of the question, some other things I've considered removing is the cell phone. While I'm currently on a plan that expires in October, after this I'm considering switching to a ""pay as you go"" phone. While this will be an excellent decrease from 170$/mo to a possible 50$/mo. I'm unable to remove the cell phone entirely as it is a requirement of my job, unfortunately they are unable to justify paying for it as I only use it 7-8 times a month for a few short minutes for work purposes. Another thing I've considered removing is the internet, unfortunately there are not any leachable spots (cafe, restaurant, etc ) that allow free WiFi. This is also another necessity that I need for my job, and my roommate needs for their job. I'm assuming most people have the same type of expenses I have, I'm wondering what is a good way to reduce costs monthly. Even if it is only 100-200$ saved per month that'd be great. What is a good way to manage my budget without much thought, currently I have my spending bank account (bank 2), which I don't care about the money in. I spend this on food/gas/silly things. This account gets 300~ dollars a paycheck (twice a month) and I seem to spend it pretty well. I don't have a debt card for bank 1, but I tend to spend my money from bank one on Credit Card 2, I typically use this when I can't find Bank 2's card or the funds are low. 

Question 3: How do I start a savings account? Sure, I have a savings account but I act as if it is my checking account (I also have one of those). Now, my idea of a savings account is not a retirement account or a rainy day fund. The idea to me of a savings account is to have some money in this account that I'm able to spend every 2-3 months on something nice for myself, such like a vacation to visit some other state to admire their beauty or some new hobby equipment. What do others do for this type of fund? Do you find something you want then start saving, or is there an amount of money set aside that you use? 

Question 4: A emergency fund or as I like to call it a ""rainy day fund"" can help any person out in a time of need. I also don't have one of these either. I've always thought of creating one, but never knew how much I should put away, I've read 3-4 months which sounds great, but my issue is how to I figure out how much I really need? How much should I put away monthly until this goal is reached? Where do I keep this money, and how do I decide if it is really rainy day? Are these funds auto-withdrawn from an account?


**TLDR:**

*Question 1: What are alternative ways to save for retirement without using a 401k or any ""can't touch till age XX"" funds.  

*Question 2: What is a good way to manage my budget without much thought

*Question 3: Savings account: how do I manage this, how much do I decide to put towards this account, when do I spend this?

*Question 4: Rainy Day fund: How much do I put towards this (Do I start with a large amount into it, or start out slowly and build up)? Is there a limit that I stop funding the account at? Where do I keep this money to prevent me from seeing/spending it?

personalfinance,"Hospital bill went into collections, 14.5k student debt. How do I raise my credit score?","**The hospital bill:** I was sent a bill from the ER.  I didn't have my insurance info on me when I went to the ER, so I had to call the hospital and tell them my insurance.  So I told them my insurance info (and I gave them two different insurance companies, too), and the lady on the other end said she'd take care of it.  Later, I get a bill and the amount is the same and there's no indication that my insurance was billed.  I wait, thinking maybe they're still processing the insurance or something, then later call again.  Again, I was told they would take care of it.  I send a letter with all the information, and then just give them my credit card information: ""If my insurance doesn't work for some reason, just bill to here...""

I get a phone call: my bill has ended up in collections.  Again, I provide the insurance information and credit card information.  Later, I notice my credit score has gone down and the item shows up in collections still, so I just finally call, skip the insurance spiel and just pay.  Now I realize I should've just pushed more and more on the pay-to-delete thing, even though I explained the situation and asked the lady if she could remove it.  She said she couldn't do anything, so I just believed her and didn't push too much further.

Now what do I do?  I'm peeved that I both 1) had to pay the bill in cash, since they never billed it to my insurance, and 2) the item shows up in collections and is hurting my credit score.

**The student debt:** I just graduated college.  Two weeks ago.  I have 14.5k in student debt, so when I checked my credit, it mentioned that the fact that I have such a high installment loan was hurting my credit.  I have about 22k in savings, so I could pay the debt in its entirety.  However, I also don't have a job yet (since, well, I just graduated); I meant to use the savings to tide me over until I found one.  I also need an apartment, in which case the credit score thing is giving me concern.  It dropped 100 points from 770 to 670.  Thoughts?

Edit: My interest rates range from 3.4% to 4.5% and I have the grace period of six months as well (or whenever I get a job) to start paying.

Edit: My biggest concern right now is that my credit score will make it harder for me to find an apartment.  That's all I really need it for, as I don't intend to buy a vehicle any time soon, nor do I need any more credit in terms of credit lines (cards, loans, etc).",finance,1402114465

robotics,Good forum/site/subreddit for help with mechanical engineering?,"Hello, 

I'm working on a non-locomotive robot design, and basically I'm stuck on some basic mechanical movement / efficiency. I'm looking for a place to go to look for help, however I'm not even sure what category this type of thing falls under.

A quick explanation / example: I have a block at a 45 degree angle, and beneath it at the bottom edge I have a small motor mounted perpendicular to the block. I have a 90degree bend coming off the shaft, so essentially it forms a pin that holds the block up.

When I activate the motor, the pin turns, releasing the block.

Problems: As lock as the block is perpendicular, my current motor is fine, however when there is a slight angle, then the motor essentially needs to overcome gravity and push the block higher to turn, which stalls the motor.

While I realize I could switch to a beefier / higher gear motor, that would represent a cost jump going from $2 to $12 per motor, or an unacceptable increase in size / complexity. While I realize there are some combinations of gears / axels that could work, right now I'm prototyping everything myself on 3D printer or hand modeling PCL, so I'd like something that is simple / more direct that I can work with myself. This is one reason I'm going with a gravity fed design over pushing the block with linear actuators and whatnot. 

I feel like there is some combination of pins / hinges / springs / angles I could use that would make this an extremely simple problem, however I just don't know what that is! What's worse, I don't even know where to look for help!

Just looking for guidance for what resources have helped you overcome micro-mechanical issues and design, thanks!",technology,1402142331

personalfinance,What is/are the best credit cards with rewards to get?,"I think I am at the point in time where I can ""make"" more off of my credit card than what I am currently getting.  I've been getting advertisements in the mail from many credit card companies, including an offer for Amex Gold.  I've torn them all up, but usually read through them before I do.  Judging from what their rewards are, I think it is time I move on from my current credit card.

What I have now: World Master Card from USAA.  I get about 1% cash back (rounding up).  No annual fee, interest rate: 7.75%.

I make as many purchases as I can on my credit card and pay it off in full every month.  I haven't had a balance carry over to the next month since 2008.  

Spending history:
YTD: $8,634;
2013: $16,410;
2012: $12,423

I don't keep a detailed breakdown of monthly expenditures, about it's about $300/month in gas, $250 in food, $300 in bills (cell phone/cable/car insurance) and the rest random purchases.  

What card/cards would benefit me the most?  Interest rate is not important.  I'd be open to a card with annual fees if the rewards outweighed the fees.  I only fly 3-4 times a year, so airline rewards are not sought after.  What I want is cash back.  Gift cards/gas cards also possibly acceptable.

**Things to Know**
* I live with my boyfriend and one roommate, so expenses are shared. Utilities are split three ways. The boyfriend was previously making about 25% of my take home, he's changed jobs and is now at about 50%. The grocery budget should be considered for two people. For rent, he currently pays $140 p/mo, but this will be going up next month most likely to a more even split between the two of us.
* For income, I have the option of working 24 hours of overtime in a bi-weekly payperiod. I've done this in the past, got rather burnt out, and have learned to appreciate not going to work more. I still do work overtime (around 10 hours b/wk), but rather than include in my budget, I put it toward my credit cards and the personal loan.
* There is a surplus of $180.00 in my budget, I consider this a cushion. While I've had a budget for a while, I never really followed it until recently. I went over budget last month (shopping and fun categories) but this cushion kept me in the green. I like the idea of having some type of cushion until I've reach a level of fiscal responsibility where I'm consistently under budget.
* A little more detail about the fun category: It's essentially for when I want to do things that are fun. Bars, street faires, eating out, coffee, etc. Usually it's for those occasions where I go out with the boyfriend or friends. I think $30 p/wk seems reasonable, and I'm certain I'd have a difficult time not going out at all, so I tried to be frugal with the budget.
* There is no emergency fund. Rather I've taken to using my US Bank Reserve Line to pull cash when needed. I know this is bad. Very bad. And while I have never used it regularly, I know I shouldn't be using it at all since it incurs debts and interest. 
* My credit score is around 635 (per Credit Karma). I don't particularly want to open any additional lines of credit, mostly because I've had each credit agency lock access to my information. I had a fraudulent account opened in the past, closed it and did the 90 day lock, and almost immediately after that period a new fraudulent account was opened. So I locked it for now. Re-opening it could definitely be an issue as one of the PDF's with the confirmation code from the agency was blank.
* As my credit cards are paid, I'll be rolling the payments onto the next. Right now I'm targeting the two lowest balance cards (both under $350) and then highest APR (remaining cards range from $700-$2754.21)

**Goals**
*I need these. Paying off credit cards really is my priority though vs. an emergency fund.


**Your Input**
* All advice and suggestions are of course welcome and appreciated!!
* Based on my situation, what would you suggest doing with the raises I know I'll be getting? I potentially will get two this year due to promoting (5%) and 6 months after that get another (5%).
* What would you suggest doing with the $300 toward the auto loan once it's paid off?
* Since I work for the county, I'm potentially eligible for student loan forgiveness for Public Service. I'd done forebearance in the past, so my eligible payments while with the county only began March 2013, meaning I have just under 9 years to go. I would only qualify for the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, and based on the calculator would reduce my student loan payment to about $120.00 per month. Since the repayment amount is based on AGI, I figured I'd take the difference (about $65 pre-tax) and add that to my 457(b) contribution, lowering next years AGI. Could this potentially snowball if each year my payments are lowered and I the difference and put it into the 457(b)? Is it worth doing loan forgiveness and paying tax on it? Based on the calculator it'd be about $1000.00 that would be forgiven.

finance,I was a victim of fraud by a Wells Fargo private banker. I'm hoping somebody from Wells Fargo or the banking industry may be able to help.,"To put it simply, a Wells Fargo teller/private banker gave me a line of credit set up as overdraft protection to my credit card without my authorization, consent, or knowledge. Months later I accidentally overdrafted my checking account by a few dollars and instead of pulling it from my savings it activated this line of credit by dropping $300 into my checking account. I had no idea this happened and this account did not show up as a line of credit or account on my internet banking page where.

Fast forward a year later, I get a call from collections saying I owe money. I told them I never opened that account and didn't owe any money. The harassment continued for months with calls from collections coming in up to 20 times a day. I know I had to pay the $300 principal back even though I never authorized it simply because it was not my money. the problem was they said I had to pay the interest first. The stress of the issue continued until they told me they would save all of the interest with a charge off if I paid the principal and that a charge off wouldn't affect my credit or life wrong. Being young, naive, and stressed I agreed and it has haunted me since.

I have tried to get this taken care of multiple times and brought it up to the highest levels of escalation. It dead ended there where my case manager's investigation consisted solely of tracking down the banker who now worked in Montana, asking the guy if he remembered me and if I wanted the line of credit. he said the banker clearly remembered me and said I did ask for it.... 

**Now I have a photographic memory and I wouldn't even remember a customer who I interacted with for only three minutes three years prior. That's like saying, ""Hey O.J., did you kill your wife? Well if you say no then you're free to go."" 

So at the very top the investigation was done poorly and incomplete. The bank manager of the location where this happened at remembered the guy. He was temporarily assigned at that location for something like 2-3 months that summer, was a shady guy who nobody liked, and she couldn't wait for him to be gone. She tried to help me fix this but encountered the same problem at the highest level of escalations because my case manager was now the manager of that department. 

I went back to the bank today and they told me that even if they could prove it was unauthorized I used the money so they couldn't do anything. The problem with that is she admitted that there's no possible scenario where even if they proved I was a victim where I couldn't have used the money. 

People have told me I should sue them or file a dispute with the credit bureaus. The problem is that every time I file a dispute all Wells Fargo has to do is say no. If I sue them and win, Wells Fargo still doesn't have to and won't fix my credit report.
 
I'm hoping a fellow redditor might be connected enough to help me out on this. I went car shopping today and instead of getting a 1-2.5% interest rate they offered me a 9.89% APR. It's been affecting my life for years and I just want it fixed. Hopefully one of you would be awesome enough to help.

TLDR: WF bank teller signed me up for a line of credit without my consent. It resulted in a charge off that's affected my credit. My dispute was handled with the precision of O.J.'s murder trial. The case manager did a shoddy job and somehow got promoted to manager of the department so even the branch manager couldn't do anything. I'm hoping there might be a high level Wells Fargo employee who might be able to help a guy out.",finance,1402170251

If I were to get a loan to pay off the CCs and then still use the CCs i will make things worse.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans up front? (US),"I'm recently finished my undergrad degree in the US with roughly $30k in student loan debt, and I'm in the very fortunate position of having a job in the tech industry that pays extremely well.

Instinctively, I want to use all the money beyond my living expenses to pay off my student loan debt and be rid of it. I like this idea because it gives me a lot more freedom to do other things in the future that may not pay so well without having to worry about making the payments. I make enough money that I can't take the student loan interest deduction on my taxes, which is another reason I think this might be a good idea.

However, a friend of mine says this is a naive thing to do: his argument is that I ought to invest for retirement and simply make the monthly payments on the loans, since the return I get on the investments is likely to be more than the interest rates on the loans (mostly 3.4%). He also argues that I could use these savings to make the monthly payments if it became necessary in the future.

What do you all think about this?",finance,1402178761

I obtained a job right out of college and will be making right around $50,000. With graduating comes those great student loans. I have accumulated quite a bit of student loans while obtaining my Master's degree and I was wondering if I should focus on paying off this debt quickly or begin tucking money away into retirement.

Debt - $65,000

I have the option to pay right around $900 each month for ten years, or I could pay around $380 each month for 30 years.

personalfinance,How to pay a Parent Plus Loan,"Guys, I have a question about a parent plus loan that my Dad took out for me to pay for college. I've been paying that loan in addition to the other student loans and credit card debt. My goal is to pay off my credit cards (&lt;2 months remaining) followed by my student loans by order of highest interest first. However this parent plus loan is a thorn in my side for two reasons. First out of all my loans it has the highest interest, and second it's not in my name. I want to minimize my interest burden. 

Background Info:
The loan has an interest rate of 7.75 and an outstanding balance of $33,000 and a monthly payment of $210. The rest of my loans have a balance of $49,000 and a monthly payment of $440. It has been in repayment since 10/2010, and it's in GRADUATED repayment. Last year I made $65,000. I have a home whose Zillow Estimate is $154,000 that I owe $70,000.

Here are my options:

1. Proceed with my current plan of paying debts that are only in my name.

2. Attempt to refinance with SOFI. Problem is my dad's credit is hot garbage and I would most likely have to cosign. Also, what is the term limit on parent plus loans (10yr, 15yr, 20yr?). If we refi, does this reset?

3. Take an equity loan on my home and pay the loan off that way.

4. NOT paying the loan. Is NOT an option a for me. Sorry I can't do that to my parents.

The goal is to minimize the interest without increasing my monthly payment too dramatically. I've recently downsized my lifestyle significantly and have an extra ($1000) a month to throw at these loans.",finance,1402191787
personalfinance,Best Method to Clear Out Debt Quick,"Currently renting, 24, married, and have a 2 year-old. Planning on buying a house in February. I'm starting to crack down on some debt incurred through the course of starting my adult life at a young age. We are currently a single-income family not financially comfortable, but getting by okay. The debt is across four credit cards, totaling about $5,000. I'm hoping to have that eliminated by December. 

I occasionally listen to Dave Ramsey in small bites and outside of the religious overtones, he seems to have pretty solid advice. The one thing that hangs me up is his so-called ""debt snowball"", where he suggests his followers knock out the smallest debt first, regardless of interest rate. This seems to be a little counter-intuitive to me. Is there any added benefit to this, other than feeling good about yourself faster? I may be missing something.

We're motivated and responsible, and not tackling a *huge* sum of money here... even though in this timeframe it doesn't *really* matter, wouldn't it be best to kill the highest rated debt first?

If anyone has additional advice, fire away. If a similar question exists, link me and I'll delete this thread. Thanks!",finance,1402203982

personalfinance,Which is the better loan forgiveness option?,"I am a speech-language pathologist working in a school in NYC. I gross about 50k/year.   After taxes, 403b deductions, and health insurance costs, I net about $2500/month.  I currently have 55k in loans (consolidated undergrad and graduate…all federal loans).  I qualify under the income based repayment plan and pay $356/month to Sallie Mae.

I have 2 partial forgiveness options and would like to get opinions on which is the better option.

#1 Teacher loan forgiveness: Under this plan, $17,500 is forgiven after 5 years of full time teaching (I am considered a teacher for these purposes).

#2 Public service loan forgiveness: After 10 years of qualifying service (for me, working in a low-income school) the loan is forgiven in its entirety after 10 years (120 payments)

I can do both options but payments/time don’t count for both.  This means that if I take the $17,500 option, the 10 year clock for the public service forgiveness starts anew.

I don’t expect my income to go up all that much in the next 10 years (maybe 5k-7k if I take on private cases).  I am trying to figure out the best option to use, taking into account that with income based repayment, my monthly dues will increase as my salary goes up and the loan amount goes down and I stop qualifying for the income based program.

Bitcoin,Staring into the event horizon,"With GHash sitting at 45% of network hashrate, we seem to be calmly drifting toward the event horizon, with seemingly little panic.  I love Bitcoin as much as anyone here, and I want to see it succeed.  I don't want to incite panic for panic's sake, but people need to be aware of what we are facing here.

Once we cross the 50% line, the rules of bitcoin breakdown.  Those truths we take for granted, cease to exist.  Bitcoin as we know it, ceases to exist.  Here are some of the changes once we cross over into &gt;50% territory:

- **No amount of confirmations is secure**: Under normal conditions, each confirmation makes a transaction exponentially more secure.  Once we cross the 50% line, confirmations become meaningless.  Ghash will essentially have the ability to write and rewrite the blockchain as they see fit.  Instead of using confirmations to trust a transaction, we have to turn to GHash's word.  At this point, 1 confirmation is equivalent to 100 confirmations, since the irreversibility of either transaction is determined by GHash's desire, not by mathematical probability.

- **Ghash is given a new magic switch**: This switch, if they choose to use it, instantly turns off all earnings of other pools.  Anyone mining in a non-GHash pool would earn nothing.  This very quickly results in Ghash moving from 51% to 100% of mining power.  This situation is almost irrecoverable, because undoing it requires half of the pool to leave.  Since there is no benefit to first movers, and max benefit to last movers, it would be unlikely that the network could recover.

There will be people that tell you that this is ""FUD"" and that GHash would have no reason to hurt the bitcoin network.  Ironically, people with this opinion are the whole reason we are in this situation!  THEY have caused this by not caring about decentralisation.  So to those people I say, if you like centralisation, why don't you go back to using dollars?  After all, the Federal Reserve would never destroy the dollar, because it would destroy their whole financial hegemony, right?  If this is your way of thinking, stop using Bitcoin now.

If we do hit these disaster scenarios, we may need to seriously consider a hardfork to change the mining algorithm.  This would render hundreds of millions of dollars of ASIC investments useless.  So long as all the economic players are willing to join in  (eg. Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain.info, the ATMs, the exchanges, Electrum, Mycelium, etc), then it doesn't matter if the miners don't agree since we leave them behind to mine their old centralised rubbish blockchain.  It would be devastating for the big miners who have their businesses destroyed, but it would sure teach them to be responsible with who they sell their hardware to.",cryptocurrency,1402208940

Travel card = 141.40

Food = 120

Accommodation = For the first 3 months I'm staying with a friend's family for £240 a month after that accommodation will be more like £600 a month

I currently have a great job where I bring in roughly $2,000 / month after tax. My goal here is to smartly pay off both my car and motorcycle, and then start saving for a house. I just don't know which order I should pay things off in. Any advice on which loan my money should go to first?  Thanks!

--INFO--

I owe $8,000 on my car @ $260/month (Lower interest rate)
I owe $9,000 on my motorcycle @ $180/month (Higher interest rate)

I have a higher interest rate on the motorcycle, obviously meaning the longer I have that loan, the more I pay. 

I guess I technically ""should"" pay the bike off first, to save a little money on interest. 

BUT my thinking is, if I pay the car off first that would then be an extra $260/month I could pay towards the bike once the car is paid off.  Or that extra $260/month could be put toward my house fund then.

I'm 24 years old living with my parents in Chicago. I've been back with the folks for 8 months and to be honest its driving me nuts and I'm looking to get out.  For a while I was looking for 2 bedroom condos but don't like what I can currently afford. It is either a nice place far from work / social life or a crappy apartment near work (the loop if you're familiar) and a social life.  I can switch to a one bedroom but I'm not sure how well it will sell when I am ready. I want to live there for 2 - 4 years building equity and then sell or rent it.

Here is a breakdown of my situation:

I technically have student loans but my parents are paying them off.  I am very blessed to have them help me like this but I'm the only one of my siblings they have taken out loans for and when my sister graduates in two years they are going to begin paying it off quicker. 

I pay my parents for car insurance and my cell phone bill, but both are really cheap and come out to about $100 / month total.

I have $40,000 in a savings account ready to do some work for me. Its earning .05% interest but I received a few hundred dollars as a bonus for opening the account.  

I make $43,000/ year. I work for the federal government and am on a nice pay schedule. February is the anniversary of my start date. Every year I get a substantial raise + a cost of living adjustment.  My coworkers say the raises are almost guaranteed unless I am a total fuck up, and even then they are still likely (but I dont like to count my chickens before they hatch).  Without COLAs, my raises will be ~ $43,000 -&gt;  $53,000 -&gt; $64,000 -&gt; $76,000.  After that raises come slower.  

I have no other substantial income or expenditures.  

What should I do with the $40,000?  Rent and keep it in the savings account? Rent and invest it in something riskier? Or put it into a 1 bed condo?

This is my life savings so I want to avoid a lot of risk. And I want a nice condo that I can be happy with after about 3 years when my income is substantially higher.

MachineLearning,Two class classification or one class classification for selecting sports articles from dataset ?,"Is the problem of classifying a document as sports-related / non-sports better handled when solved as a one class classifier problem ?

I have worked on a similar problem earlier using Naive-Bayes classifier where  was trying to use two-class classifier, and since the negative class could not be sampled well, I had to train with an unreasonably high number of negative samples and scale down classifier output for this bias, and still the accuracy was at best 75%.

I have a similar problem at hand again, and I can choose between one/two class classifier for it (When I did it last time few years back, I did not have idea about one-class classification).

There are two constraints that I have to address :

1. The classifier needs to have high precision, a low recall is OK for initial performance . However both mistakes of wrongly classified negative samples as positive (error in precision) and missed out positive class documents (error in recall) will have to be relearnt via feedback.
2. The documents classified wrongly will be given back as feedback .

I am tempted to try out a one-class classifiers, but want to check whether commonly used implementations like one class SVM can somehow be fed back the errors ? This would be really well handled in a MaxEnt/NaiveBayes method, but then I will have to use the bias again, that is putting in too many negative class documents to train, which I dont want to do.",technology,1402262707

Though I don't know my exact score, I have very good credit and anticipate no problems making payments or even prepaying the principal once I start getting paid.  I want to minimize how much I waste paying interest, but the adage of never borrowing from/lending to friends echoes in my head.  Any advice/insight on which of (b) or (c) would provide a better rate?  Thanks!",finance,1402263579

personalfinance,"My mom opened a savings account for me, but she is listed as a joint owner -- is this a bad idea?","Backstory:


My mom is having a sort of financial late-life crisis. She's over 50, and starting to realize that she's not going to be able to work forever. 


She works for an airline, and her pension got taken from her after 9/11. In order for her airline to keep from going bankrupt or something similar, the employee's union gave up their pensions. I'm not 100% sure about the rest of her finances, but I know she's been working with various investment companies in a bit of a scramble to have enough to retire. I mean, she's not doing terrible, she owns 3 rental properties. But, I suspect they may be underwater because she bought them pre-2003.

----------
Now she wants to instill her hard-learned financial lessons in me. So, recently she took me to her credit union and opened a savings account with $1,000 in both of our names. I'm the primary and she's a joint owner.

Her rational on having her as a joint owner stems from the fact that I occasionally work out of state or even overseas. She's had to transfer some money into my account for me in the past as a short term-loan. I needed to pay first/last &amp; deposit on an apartment for work, and didn't have that kind of cash in my account at the time.

She said if that situation ever arrises again, she'll be able to transfer money directly from her account to mine online much easier than just driving to my bank and having to do a teller deposit with my acct #.

----------
I actually would love to use this account as my primary savings, and I think I'd like to switch over from BOA completely to the credit union, which offers much better interest rates .7% vs .03%.

I just want to know if this is in general, a bad idea. I love my mom, and I know she would never steal from me. So, I'm wondering what the pitfalls of having a joint account might be. Is there a better option that will protect both of us, but will still allow her to easily transfer funds to my account if the need should ever arise?

------------------------------------------
**TL;DR**

solar,Researching on installing solar in NY (Hudson Valley - Central Hudson Utility),"Has anybody in the area (or state) have had solar panels installed in their residence? I'm trying to find local experiences from various companies as well as how others financially decided to go forward with solar.  

I took a trip to see **New York State's Solar Farm** facility last week and bottom line cost (with SunPower's longer warranty of 25 years made it easy to spend a little extra for them).  

Financially, from the installer, there's a NYSERDA incentive that takes $1.00/watt off the top. That is, a 5kW system that costs $20k will be $15k. In addition, a Federal tax credit of 30% and 25% NY State tax credit both post NYSERDA and won't be effectively realized until tax filing.  

On the financial return, I've notice the previous 4 months of my electric bill have been noticeably high. The sooner I enter the PV world, the sooner I realize the returns. Pre-""those 4 months"", I calculated my break even return will happen in **12.8 years** (this is for a SunPower system at the system cost of *$25.5k* which is *$19.6k out of pocket* after NYSERDA and effectively just *under 9k after the tax credits*). If I average the last 12 months of rates, the return comes down to **9.3 years**. I don't see rates coming down in the near future and I see the later return time to be more realistic.  

Also, In New York State, legislation was passed to limit how much power can be returned back to the grid, cost wise and that is 10 per cent. That is, if I produce 5.5kW and utilize 4.9kW, Central Hudson gets the 600W but credits me 500W. Still, my ROI will be pushed up further.

Is this typical, cost and time wise? Is this worth the investment? Anybody with any regrets? Or, any advice and pitfalls?",energy,1402268686

ethereum,Ethereum: Solving Complexity,"The Roman Empire represents one of the most incredible political and social entities in history. In many areas, they laid the foundation of Western civilization—language, law, politics, engineering, architecture, trade—these are just some of the fields revolutionized by the Romans. One could argue that no other society has made as significant contributions to modern society.
 
Yet despite their advancement, the Roman Empire eventually collapsed. There have been thousands of books written on the subject of Rome’s collapse, and just as many theories bandied about. One such theory, however, may hold the key to the reason such complex civilizations can fail. Joseph Tainter’s Collapse of Complex Societies suggests that civilizations like the Romans or Mayans ultimately fall under the weight of their own complexity. As a society solves more and more challenging problems, they build complicated new laws, infrastructure, and bureaucracy to solve them. Each major problem requires a new level of complexity to be piled on top of the existing social structure. Eventually, society reaches a point of diminishing returns, and can quite literally collapse under its own weight.
 
Fast-forward two thousand years, and many would agree that modern society is becoming dangerously complex and difficult to navigate. Entrenched bureaucracies—in politics and in business—are severely limiting efficiency. Mass media has created more polarizing than informative effects. Financial power is becoming dangerously concentrated. As new technologies are invented and new social mores developed, society and government respond by adding new rules or trying to remake old ones. Bitcoin has regulators scrambling to figure out how to apply laws based on ancient technology (physical money) to the digital world. Bittorrent, Youtube, DVRs and the like are forcing Congress to consider how to modify antiquated legal structures to protect intellectual property without stifling innovation. So far, they seem to be failing.
 
As modern society becomes more complex, it becomes more centralized. Stocks are exchanged through NYSE, NASDAQ, and the like. Houses are bought and sold through a highly structured industry involving title searches, insurance, mortgages, mortgage insurance, notaries, lawyers, and realtors. Three credit bureaus control a person’s entire financial future—not only determining his ability to get loans, but also playing a role in deciding insurance rates. Some employers are even denying jobs to applicants whose credit score doesn’t meet expectations. Stocks and other securities are rated by three agencies which essentially have a federally-granted monopoly. Insurance companies have become so big that in the case of AIG, they threatened to bring down the entire economy. Even such vital utilities as electricity are often controlled by companies who have been granted a regulated monopoly.
 
What if there was a way to decentralize some of these things? What if some of these layers of complexity and bureaucracy could be stripped away by allowing people to do business directly with other people, in a way that did not require or desire government oversight. What if doing business over the internet no longer required trust, since such transactions would be mediated by a system of smart contracts and a perfect block chain? The decentralization of modern society could ultimately save it.

personalfinance,Using ARM loan as leverage for market investment,"Can anyone critique or confirm my thinking on our home loan?

I have a home selected for about $420,000, I'd put a down payment of $100,000 and loan the remaining $320,000.

* Liquid Assets (Cash, Taxable Accounts): $140,000
* Real Estate Assets (2 houses): $360,000
* Retirement/College Fund Assets: $120,000
* Age 33, Annual Income ~$150,000
* No Debt

The real estate assets I intend to sell: The house we currently live in immediately after moving ($160,000), and a second house that I rent out that I would sell when the tenant moves ($200,000). 

In the past I probably would've picked a fixed rate loan and funneled all of my money into paying it off as quickly as possible. However, with loan rates so low right now I'm more interested in investing the money into low cost index funds, basically leveraging the home loan to maximize my return from the market. The interest I'll be paying will also put me past the standard deduction, so I'll get a bit more 'return' via tax efficiency as well.

Currently, I can't escape the conclusion that a 5/1 ARM loan seems to be the way to go:

* I can get an ARM loan for 2.75% with 0 points, compared to the 4.0% on 30 year fixed. The difference in rate here is huge.
* I can get a 15 year fixed for 3.3%, but the principle payments will be much higher, and so I'll have an opportunity cost in that money will be going to pay off the loan instead of investing it in the market.
* After 5 years a few things could happen: a) The interest rate stays low (yay). b) The interest rate rises to be comparable to a 15 year fixed (ok). c) Interest rate sky rockets (I begin liquidating my investments to pay off the mortgage quickly)

I guess #3 is where I'm iffy, but the plan seems reasonable to me. In the worst case where interest rates go way up, I lose the continuing opportunity in leveraging my mortgage after 5 years, but if they don't rise too much then I save thousands in interest payments, and earn thousands from extra money invested in the market.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on two specific questions about long-term financial decisions.,"So I am very new to this sub, but I am serious about taking control of my finances. First, the stats: 

DEBTS
Student Loans: ~$35K - government (and growing)

~$10K - parents
 
Bank loan: $2,400 (also for school) - interest rate is 9%

Bank credit line: $2,010 (money I had to borrow for emergency car repairs)– interest rate is 13.25%, and I’m watching the interest accrue every day, which is making me panicky – that $10 has accrued since I opened the credit line roughly 2 weeks ago

Bank credit card: $95 balance, 22% interest rate


INCOME:  $1,150/mo (high estimate) 
I work two part-time jobs. My primary job brings in $500/paycheck, $1,000 a month, if I don’t miss work for some reason or if there isn’t a holiday, then it’s a little less. 
My second job is something I’ve been slowly phasing myself out of, because although I love it, the cost of gas to get to the location is ridiculous. That job, since I’ve cut back, is bringing in about $75/paycheck, or $150/mo. 


MONTHLY EXPENSES: 
$300 payment on loan from parents (I’m trying to negotiate this down, but neither of my parents is working and they need the money).

$143 cell (the details of this are a little complicated, I can explain if necessary, but essentially I’m paying for 4 phone lines for my immediate family members, plus a new iPhone and insurance for myself)

$100 – gas 
$97 – minimum payment on the bank loan 
$47 – auto insurance 
??? – minimum payment on the credit line (haven’t received a statement for this yet).

The roughly $300 surplus is easily spent, usually on more gas, food, clothes, alcohol, travel, and books (in that order). 

I have two major questions, one straightforward, one more complicated: 

**1. Should I try to sell my car, a 2000 Honda Civic, and take on a monthly auto payment for a newer, more reliable car? I will absolutely need to have a reliable car in the fall of 2015.** 

**2. I have a bachelor's degree and am currently studying to earn my teacher certification (and eventually my master’s). If I end up teaching in a low-income school, I can have a certain percentage of my loans forgiven (and all of my $8,000 Perkins loan cancelled). Does anyone know off the top of his/her head if the interest on government loans can be cancelled? Would it be a good idea to pay the interest off now? My mom is insisting that I pay the interest on the unsubsidized loans (principal on those totals $3,000) but I would rather pay off the bank.** 

This fall I’m planning on picking up some days substitute teaching, which will be great for several reasons, and bring in more income than a half-day at my primary job does. So hopefully I will see an income increase in the coming months. 

My immediate goals: 

1.	Pay off the credit card
2.	Save a small amount to visit a very close friend in NYC who won’t be there much longer
3. Save for tuition that loans won't cover
3.	Pay off the credit line 
4.	Pay off the loan (the early pay-off penalty fee is if I pay it off before this September, which is very unlikely).
5.	Pay off the interest on the student loans ???
6.	Save for living expenses for the semester I’m student teaching
7.	Save for a new car
8.	Save for an emergency fund


I can’t believe how good it feels to write out all of this. Please let me know what you think about the car situation especially, but if you have any advice/tips for the rest, I’d really appreciate it! Thank you! ☺",finance,1402287375

""Foreign transaction fees: 0.80% of transaction amount if in U.S. dollars, 1% of transaction amount if must convert to U.S. dollars.""

Now the cashRewards card rewards 1% cash back and 1.5% if you spend over 10k a year on the card(I don't). It would seem that the 1% cash back would marginally make it a better choice since it would counteract the normal foreign transaction fees, will still allowing me to benefit for the normal cash rewards when spending back home.

personalfinance,"My SO has a shady landlord, and wants to withhold her last month of rent and let him keep the security deposit so he doesn't try to falsely claim damages","This guy has been nothing but trouble from the start, and she has a bad feeling that he will try to keep the deposit on a bogus damage claim or at least hold on to it until the last possible second.

She's leaving the apartment in the same condition as when she moved in by the way, so he has no real grounds for damage claims. Pictures will be taken when she moves out.

Here's a partial list of this guy's scumbaggery:

- She saw a giant rat run across her kitchen. Instead of hiring an exterminator, he sent her a box of 5 tiny mouse traps, which a rat would simply laugh at and enjoy the free snack.

- The heating bill for January was &gt;$300 for her single-room apartment due to crappy insulation and rotting old windows. He refused to admit there was a problem let alone do anything about it.

- She asked him to change the light bulb on the high (12+ foot) ceiling, and he huffed and rolled his eyes for 2 weeks before doing it. This is stated as his responsibility on the lease and she doesn't even own a ladder.

- In the new craigslist ad for her apartment, he listed that the antique kitchen table that her father built for her by hand came with the apartment. She specifically told him that this was NOT the case, but the same ad is still up.

- She talked to her neighbors and the entire building except for one person is moving out just because this guy sucks so bad.

He's a do-nothing landlord who just wants to sit there and collect rent checks so he can continue to throw money at his failing art career. He can get away with this behavior because it is a high housing demand area, and there will always be another unsuspecting tenant ready to move in.

So I know that an eviction process would likely take more than a month, so it's not like she's going to be out on the street. Plus this guy is obviously pretty lazy and not on top of his game.

But what is the general consensus on this plan of action? Are there any risks or routes of retaliation that this guy could take? Any advice would be appreciated. I'll say that this is in Boston, if that matters.

Edit 1: Thanks for the responses. I think I'm going to advise her to just pay the last month's rent, and document the hell out of everything in the apartment. Some people have also suggested a walkthrough with the landlord before she moves out, which is a great idea. This way if it comes down to small claims court, she will be completely in the right. Plus, she might even be able to sue him for 3x the security deposit if he withholds it. I think the key lesson here is that you need to be willing to go to small claims court in a case like this.

Edit 2: Yes, I know that the issues listed above aren't the worst things a landlord has ever done and won't mean much in court. I'm just using them as examples of his shitty attitude, and why we think that he might decide to keep the security deposit.

Edit 3: Yes, it was a rat. She's not an idiot and she knows the difference. I've had rats myself before and I know for a fact that mouse traps won't do a damn thing to a rat.

Edit 4: The table itself isn't antique, but he used wood from the hull of an antique ship for the tabletop. It's a really nice table.",finance,1402322167
personalfinance,"[22/F] Returning to university 2 years later, need financial advice! (Lengthy post)","I was in college right out of high school in 2010, had good grades, a good ACT score, and received financial aid and scholarships which paid for most of my schooling.  Stuff happened, I became severely depressed, and lost interest in everything (especially school).

I dropped out after my second year and haven't been able to return due to ~$1400 I owe my university and the fact that I'm ineligible for financial aid and most scholarships because of my gpa from the last year I was enrolled.

I work full-time as a receptionist now and now make $10/hr. plus $15/hr. overtime (I get anywhere from 2.5 to 7.5 hours in overtime each week) as of last week thanks to a raise from my boss.  Taxes taken out around about 16%.

An incredible thing has happened, someone close to me has offered to loan me the $1400 I owe my university so that I actually have the opportunity to go back.  I am aiming on returning in the spring semester of 2015, so starting January.  Because of my last semester's grades, I will have to pay completely out of pocket unless I take out a private student loan.  I am ineligible for federal aid and most scholarships due to my gpa (somewhere around 2.0).

I will continue working full-time until I start school.  I guess I just want general advice for paying back the person who intends to loan me this sum of money, how much I should aim to save each month up until January, and whether it is an awful idea to check into getting a small private loan strictly for the first semester back in order to improve my gpa for financial aid.

My monthly expenses are as follows:

* Rent $310
* Gas/electric $100
* Internet $39
* Phone $100 (locked in on mom's contract, payment for new phone added in monthly bill)
* Student loans $87
* Car insurance $71
* Car payment $100 (Balance remaining is $435)
* Fuel $80
* Total = $887
* Monthly take home is ~$1440-1760 depending on overtime.

Oh, and the estimated cost of the spring semester taking 12 credit hours is approximately $3340 without the cost of books.  My school does have a Payment Option Plan that would allow me to pay out the cost of my semester out over 5 months.


Any advice would really be helpful, thank you in advance.

**Edit:**  Alright guys, I think I've got a better plan together now.  I got good advice and confirmation from several people here.  I am not going to accept the loan and will instead work towards putting every extra bit I have towards paying off my university balance so that I can enroll by January 9th for the spring semester.  Aside from that, I will save money towards the cost of my semester and pay the remainder out via my university's Payment Option Plan.  Thanks for everyone's help.

personalfinance,"Law student, debt free: massive student line of credit available—invest it? What would you do? (CA)","Hey, I love lurking here and I created an account just to ask for this community's advice. I'm wondering, basically, whether it's wise to use some of my student line of credit for an investment, either in property or something else. I am pretty financially responsible, but don't know the first thing about investing, interest rates, etc. etc.

First of all it bears pointing out that I'm in Canada, and going to a prestigious law school. My tuition is about $3,500 per year, plus books — so it's not like I'm going to an American university and spending 100k+/year on tuition.

I'm a woman in my early 20's, have two postsecondary degrees, and am completely debt-free (I've always worked while in school). I also have a well paying part-time job, which is a contract I'll have for at least the next year. Here's my situation:

* 2014-2015 Fixed expenses (rent, hydro, clothes, phone, food, fun), including books and tuition: $19,200

* 2014-2015 Anticipated revenue (work, side contracts, FT summer work): $20,000 (take home)

So let's say those two cancel themselves out... I also have:

* $2,200 in an RRSP (retirement savings plan) which I can borrow from myself at 0% interest as long as it's repaid in 15 years.

* $2,400 in a TFSA (tax-free savings account) which is basically just cash I've saved.

* $3,200 in interest-free government student loan this past year, which instead of spending I put into my savings account (while doing my graduate program). Over the next three years I will probably receive about $3,000 more each year in the same form (so by 2018, about $12,000). I do not need to pay any of this money back until six months after finishing law school (2018), at which point it starts to accumulate interest, so I would like to pay it back in full immediately. (I know in the U.S. there seems to be some moral issue with doing this, but here it's standard that I receive these funds and hold on to them until the end of my education). 

* Finally, my bank has given me a professional student line of credit for $60,000. The interest rate is prime + 0.5% while I'm in school (3.5%) and for a full year after my studies, and then and prime +3.5 afterwards. While I'm in school, I only need to pay the interest on what I've borrowed. When I'm done, there's no penalty for early repayment.

**My question is basically:** how can I make access to all this credit work for me? It's not like I'm going to be making a ton of money while I'm a full-time student, but I also feel like I have this 3-4 year period where this money could be working for me instead of sitting in the bank. Should I invest it? How? 

Similarly, **investing in property** is starting to make sense for my boyfriend and I instead of renting (we've been together for a long time and are in a very financially/emotionally stable relationship). We split $1000 per month, but could easily afford a few hundred more (his salary is much more than mine). Mortgage payments on the kind of property we'd move to would likely be pretty similar to what we're paying in rent now. I have a friend who took his line of credit and used it to put a downpayment on a property when he entered med school. Instead of paying rent, he moved in and just paid his mortgage off, and when he was done med school and it was time to pay back his loans, he sold the property and ended up with enough to pay them back in full, and made a bit of profit. Is this incredibly risky? Does it ever make sense to use borrowed money for a downpayment?

I would honestly love your advice: I want to do this right, make the best of the financial tools available to me, and avoid making stupid decisions. I would really, sincerely love whatever thoughts you have to offer! Thank you so much.

investing,Does a 30-year treasury bond yield rate of 3.44% mean 30-year treasury bonds are a bad investment now?,"I've read some theory that says that a treasury bond fund returns on average the average yield of its bonds upon purchase. So if the 30-year rate is 3.44%, and I buy a long-term treasury bond fund, the rate of return over the next 30 years should be about 3.44%. Does this make it a weak investment right now given the long-run returns have been on the order of 6-7%?

Would it be strictly better to buy short or intermediate term bonds, then wait for interest rates to rise, then buy long term bonds once the rates have gone up a little? Or if that strategy *was* strictly better, would there be some downside? For example, what if interest rates never go back up and remain stagnant or fall? Then the short or medium rate would *never* pass the long rate.

So what's the deal with long term treasuries? Are they, on average, a higher risk/higher reward investment than shorter treasuries? Is it simply naive market timing to think I can beat the market by ""deferring"" a long-term bond purchase I intend to make?

No debt

$35K in Vanguard index funds - about 70/30 stocks/bonds

$12K in TSP (mostly Roth TSP), will be leaving Fed shortly

personalfinance,Looking for a bit of advice on refinancing,"Hi PF, I’ve come for some advice again – hopefully I can pick some brains to get a better idea of the best way to make better of my current situation.

I just recently graduated college, and started a new job ($57,800 base pay) and purchased a condo.  This was all according to plan, until my lender hadn’t realized I was looking at condo’s and informed me I was at a 46% DTI (debt to income) and couldn’t go over 43%.  The plan was to get a 15Y note with 5% down, pay extra to be out of PMI within 18 months (be at 80% LTV) and continue to put the extra $100 or so of PMI at principle and have it paid off sooner, but I’ve gotten stuck with a 30Y due to that roughly 3% DTI overage.

The interest difference every month is $142.50 (1% /12 of $171,000 is the difference in interest rates) goes to interest instead of principle.  

I’m looking for advice on timeline of refinancing.  I have no prepayment penalties or anything, I would just incur the refi closing costs, which I’m expecting around $2,000.  The way I see it – I’m paying $3700 extra in interest in the next 24 months, so if I refi in 12 months or sooner, it’s a wash.

I have a few options:

I’m an actuary, and am taking two exams this fall which each will come with a $2400 salary bump, and I should get a standard 3-5% COLA/ merit increase as well – putting me somewhere in the ballpark of $62-64k

Refi in 24 months to 10Y and buy down/ have 20% LTV (no PMI)
Refi in 6-12 months to 15Y with increased salary, buy down what’s necessary to be &lt;43% DTI, pay extra till PMI is off.

If interested/ helpful, my current monthly debts are:

$360 – car ($20k remaining)

$853 – mortgage 30Y ($171,000 remaining)

$95 – PMI 0.67% annually

$100 – Homeowners insurance

$75 – property taxes

$226 – HOA

$128 – student loans ($12,800 remaining)

$100 – credit cards (paid off in full monthly, but have minimums that show on credit report)


$600 – food/ grocery/ entertainment/ gas

$98 – auto insurance

$150 – utilities, internet

$60 – phone

$258 – scholarship repayment, no interest loan if paid back within 5 Years ($15,500 remaining) (doesn’t show on credit report)

$180 – 401(k) ROTH (5% of income)

personalfinance,Help me turn it around!,"Hi r/personalfinance!

I have been a long time reader but am just now posting for the first time. I have been basically self-sufficient for a few years and have done fairly well. However, a couple of years ago I started partaking in the rat race that is living beyond one’s means. I haven’t made my situation any worse in the last year – but I also have been doing nothing to make it better. Now is the time. I would like to plan on having all of my debts paid off by the early part of 2015 so that I can at least start building up a healthy emergency fund and then eventually buy a house with fiancée after we are married.
Here are my particulars:

-	24 years old
-	Engaged (getting married in September 2015 – wedding is being paid for by fiancée’s parents)
-	$46k/year gross salary ($2,310 per month take home... I live in a low cost of living area in the upper midwest)
-	Company matches 50% up to the first 1% (increasing to 4% next year)
-	No student loan debt
-	$50k term life insurance provided by employer
-	Monthly expenses

   o	$500 in rent

   o	$400 average in utilities (Internet, gas/water, power – I live in a cold climate so costs during winter are very high which is why the high average)

   o	$140 in gas

   o	$400 in food

-	Savings/investments

   o	$5.5k in cash (sitting in Wells Fargo savings account)

   o	$1,900 in Roth 401k (just started to contributing this January @ 10% of gross salary)
-	Consumer debt:

   o	$5k @ 11.15% via Wells Fargo credit card with $6k limit (minimum payment is $175)

   o	$394 @ 24.24% via Best Buy credit card with $1.5k limit (minimum payment is $25)

   o	$0 via Amazon Store Credit Card with $1.4k limit

   o	Unknown balance on secured loan that I pay $320 per month on (trying to get payoff information and interest rate from my banker, but by my math I only have $1.5k to go until paid off and I believe the interest rate is 3.5%)

I think that the obvious thing is to immediately pay off the Best Buy CC @ 24.24% and then start throwing everything at the Wells Fargo CC. My question, however, is does it make sense to pay down any of the consumer debt with any of my $5,500 cash on hand? $5,500 basically serves as my emergency fund so I would be putting that at risk, but I would be able to build it back up and then some very quickly with this debt paid off. If something were to happen while my fund was low, I do have the fortunate ability to fall back on my parents if need be. Obviously I would rather not do this as I haven’t ever borrowed money from them yet, but that is an option in an extreme, worth case scenario. I would expect to be able to build the fund back up in a few months.

My biggest crutch has been going out to eat/bars which I have pulled back on heavily, as well as buying things for my hobbies (cars and guns). This is where the other $550 a month has been going. I setup Mint a few weeks ago and have been pretty disturbed by the trends I’ve seen. Just taking the time to sit down and look at where all of my money has been going has been reason enough for me to stop going to restaurants and start paying down and off all of my consumer debt and then build up a solid emergency fund and contribute more towards retirement.

Another part of this conversation will be talking to my fiancée about my financial goals as well as our joint goals. I think if she knew what I was facing it would make her less apt to suggest going out to eat or understanding why I might not want to go out with friends 3 nights a week. The good news is she has a good financial head on her shoulders so this shouldn't be a difficult conversation. She has no debt.

Bitcoin,Possible? Thought Experiment: Governments become biggest miners,"I just read http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/27pd0y/the_benevolent_mining_monopoly/ and wondered:

Suppose Bitcoin (or some other crypto) becomes wildly successful and moves on to become the world reserve currency, and is easily usable by everyone as cash replacement.

In this case Bitcoin is of course a huge threat to every government, as they lose all income through seignorage and all control over influencing monetary policy.

So they try to fight it/ban it/tax it to death, and are just as successful as they are in shutting down Bittorrent.

Would it then be possible to imagine that governments start to embrace it and begin to mine?

In the event that Bitcoin is impossible to kill, it would seem logical to me, as it would

- provide income through seignorage
- provide income through tx fees
- ensure the continued ability for citizens and businesses to safely transact (since under the ""global reserve currency"" assumption local currencies would probably start failing)

Furthermore, governments would keep each other in check to prevent 51% attacks, as the US would not want China to be able to block their transactions, which would have the side effect that governments are also unable to block transactions of unwanted entities like whistleblower sites.

Also I know quite a few people here want to end both banking and state.
But the governments would not be able to blacklist addresses or block transactions, as this would require cooperation between all mining governments to collude in blocking.

There is only one big threat, total surveillance of every transaction. But this should eventually cease to be an issue, as coinjoin/mixing services become more prevalent and other currencies with higher anonymity like CryptoNote-based coins are already available.

And why do you usually not get a lower interest rate with a credit score above 740, even though there is a lower risk of default (albeit only slightly)?

EDIT: Sorry, I realize my wording was not clear. I am talking about fixed rate loans, but with the interest rate determined by the debtor's initial credit rating.

nuclear,Hi /r/nuclear - I'm wondering if anyone can correct my misunderstanding of why nuclear is often charged with being too expensive,"I have a few environmentalist friends who are adamantly against nuclear. It seems like whenever we talk they bring up the fact that nuclear is too expensive and too risky, and private investment won't happen without government loan guarantees.  Here is my understanding of what is really going on here, without sources.  Please correct any misunderstandings I have:  


* It is an expensive process to get approval, and get a license from the NRC to build a nuclear reactor.  The approval process takes years, and is funded by the entity that wants to build the reactor.  
* This long lead time (and the uncertainty of whether approval will ever come) for approval acts as a deterrent for utilities when deciding what kind of plant to build to increase/replace generation capacity.  The uncertainty is huge.  
* The possibility that the money will be spent to license and build a reactor, and then a state will pass a law making it so the plant can't open.  Like what happened with Shoreham.  Shoreham looms as a shining example that investors can lose all the money invested into a nuclear project with zero return at all.  Shoreham is why investors are afraid of nuclear power.  
* To counter the risk of the government not allowing you to operate a completed nuclear project (like what happened with Shoreham), groups seeking to build a nuclear reactor often seek for federal loan guarantees.  These loan guarantees are not free.  Any company seeking for a loan guarantee has to be spending 20% of its own money on the project, and in addition to that, has to pay the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars in exchange for the loan guarantee.  The loan guarantee is more like political leverage to prevent another possible Shoreham.  
* It is my understanding that the federal government has never had to pay out on a federal loan guarantee.  
* It is my understanding that the federal government effectively makes a large profit on these federal loan guarantees because the projects are very safe in and of themselves, but the risk that the nuclear plant builders are concerned about is that the environmentalists won't allow them to sell electricity when the plant is completed.  
* It is my understanding that people opposed to nuclear power decry these loan guarantees as proof that nuclear power is very risky, and investors don't trust their own projects, when in reality- investors don't trust the stability of the legal climate.

Sounds great, but I don't even know if I would qualify for it. I am wondering if anyone here can help me clear this up because my loan servicer and the student aid folks were not very helpful.

I saw previous posts on this sub regarding the program with this link that is supposed to explain everything: https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/teacher

When I go through the eligibility requirements, I can answer yes to all of the questions... However, I am not a general or special education teacher. I do not have a teaching certificate. I am a school social worker (licensed and state approved). I am trying to figure out if I would qualify for this forgiveness program after the 5 years working in a school.

The following is from the link:

Who is considered a teacher?

A teacher is someone who provides students direct classroom teaching, or classroom-type teaching in a nonclassroom setting, or educational services directly related to classroom teaching (for example, school librarian or guidance counselor).

Can I take this as assurance that I would qualify as a school social worker? No where on the program site do they mention my job and I am trying to figure this out for sure before I decide on an approach to paying off my loans (If I do not qualify for this, I plan to pay it off aggressively).

personalfinance,Best way to quickly raise credit score?,"I am wondering what is the quickest way to rebuild my credit. In September 2013 I completed a chapter 13 bankruptcy plan after filing in 2008. I know its going to be a long road but I'm wondering what the best way is to proceed. I have come a long way since filing and make about 3x what I did in 2008. I learned a LOT about money and credit along the way.

I have the following financial status:

* Annual salary: $125,000/yr. ( take home is about $7000/mo.)
* Rent: $1650/mo
* Car payment: $605/mo. (bought car  in December 2013 because my pre-bankruptcy car bought in 2006 kicked the bucket with a bad transmission )
* Credit card 1: first premier with $700 line of credit
* Credit card 2: capital one with $300 line of credit
* Got both cards right after discharge, which is when I got the new job. So they haven't been open long enough to get a limit increase.
* $2000 in emergency fund and growing every 2 weeks.
* No other debt and I pay off the cards in full each month. They are only used for work travel, so I pay them off immediately as I get my travel reimbursement. Sometimes I charge them up, pay off, then charge/pay off again all in the same month depending on how much I have to travel.

My FICO score is 613 right now through Equifax. I started at around 580 in December. I am the sole breadwinner for my family of 6, so I don't have the rest of my paycheck as disposable income, but with our budget we live comfortably.

My main concern is raising my score enough to get a higher limit on my cards. I don't want to worry about not having enough credit to travel for work. Honestly its embarrassing having to worry about which card to use for my hotel room when traveling with coworkers, but I made my bed with my poor financial decisions in the past and I have to live with them.

Should I try to take out a signature loan with a large interest rate just to get the positive payment history? Should I try to get another credit card? What's the best way to go?

personalfinance,Independent Contractor in California: Estimated Quarterly Tax Payment Question,"Hello everybody,

I recently graduated from dental school last year, worked for 3 months in 2013 and filed my taxes normally (the annual april tax date).

Since then I've been working in 2014, but didn't really realize I was supposed to pay quarterly an estimated tax.... (ya, I'm retarded) I contacted my tax person, and she said that I'm already late, and I should just put aside around 15% of my monthly earnings, and pay everything at the end. I've been reading online that there are penalties per day for being late. Should I attempt to meet the other deadlines

"" Important: California differs from federal To avoid an estimate penalty, you must pay at least:

30 percent First quarter (April 15)
40 percent Second quarter (June 15)
0 percent Third quarter (September 15)
30 percent Fourth quarter (January 15)

If so, should I pay the first quarter along with the second quarter in one payment?

Also, not really sure how I'm supposed to estimate my income, as I only worked 3 months last year.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

* Should I move some money from one savings venture to a debt?

I believe even after I leave I can roll accounts into my TSP, but the only other account is a vanguard roth that's doing better than my TSP so I probably wouldn't do that.

Fiance has about $31k in Federal Student Loans (broken down it is 7 loans, some Subsidized and others Unsubsidized --see below). I do not have any loans currently. In addition to her Federal Loans, she has $28k in private loans. All being paid monthly through Sallie Mae. Getting married this fall, so filing jointly next year will probably throw a few things off for a program like PAYE.

I make about $43k a year, last year being fresh out of college she only made $12k. Her income for this next year will have risen somewhat but not probably more than $25k for the year. Right now we are living fine paying the loans as is with our combined income but we feel like we should consolidate or something to improve and lower the loans.

Right now she pays approx $360 a month each for the Fed &amp; Private loans (total of right over $700). Obviously she would like to have a lower payment. She saw something about the PAYE program from a friend on Facebook and applied through one of the 3rd Party Groups (http://www.studentloanservice.us/) - Some of the info they were giving us was good but other parts seemed too good to be true, which is why I am asking for advice. 

The program they offer is $500 upfront fee, then $49 a month fee for 20 years. This is based on owing $0 in loans a month because of her low income. I asked what happens when she makes more money this next year and/or when we get married and file jointly. They told me the $0 rate would rise to reflect our income. Meaning it could put the payments back up to around the $300-350 range including the $49 monthly fee.

Loans by type, money owed and interest rate:

1- Sub - $295 - 4.5%

2- Sub - $479 - 3.4%

3- Unsub - $7,124 - 6.8%

How do I figure out a good salary offer to meet my expenses and achieve my goal of paying off my debts? How do benefits factor in?

First post, I think I'm in the right place. Wall of text incoming. 

Some background first:
Long time lurker here, created an  account today because I'll be meeting with the upper management of the ""small"" restaurant where I work as a waiter to discuss my ""growth"" with the company. I'm not the first waiter to have this happen, others have gone on to become managers and a couple have become ""salaried"" servers. The ones who become managers seem to regret their decision while the ones who are salaried servers work long hours but make way more than the managers (generalization from the managers about the salaried servers).

Right now I live in Minnesota and by some miracle I earn 7.25/hr + tips. This is scheduled to increase to 8/hr in August, 9/hr in Aug 2015, and finally 9.50/hr in Aug 2016.

Last year I earned about 45k (gross) in wages &amp; tips while working about 30 hours/week on average (a couple weeks had negligible overtime, but some weeks I only worked 20 hours). My employer does not provide any benefits to me in my current position. I know that one of the salaried servers is now required to work at least 55 hours/week but also says that there are benefits

My expenses include student loans (B.S. Biology, ~65k debt federal and private) and a car payment (~6k remaining at 270 a month) in addition to the normal expenses of rent, food, utilities, etc. Expenses per month currently are 2.2k but might increase up to 2.5k monthly in September when my living situation changes. I have no credit card debt, only about 1 month's expenses in an emergency fund, a small 401k from a former employer valued at 6k, and a personal Roth IRA at about 5k.

Finally, my dilemma:
How do I get the most out of this situation?  I know my tip income will go up the more I work, but if we aren't busy I still need to pay my bills. I also don't want to work for free, but understand that my employer needs an incentive to put me on salary. I would like to pay off my car and my student loans (the sooner the better) and I feel like this could help me achieve that goal.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

Bitcoin,Spending Bitcoin - it's a bit like a departure lounge at an airport,"On another reddit post I likened buying Bitcoin to a drugs transaction. 

However armed with my 0.1 Bitcoin I have been looking for genuine things to spend it on. After all that's what you are supposed to do with money. To be a serious currency it has to be a means of exchange and not just a hedge against inflation, sticking it to the Federal Reserve, a political statement of anarchy or whatever. 

Yes there are retailers that accept Bitcoin. For them the saving in credit card charges is good but is the effort of me shuffling my pounds into BTC worthwhile. In the conventional economy you are looking for a good deal but with only a small number of retailers actually accepting the currency then you could be losing out to just using regular money because you restrict your choice. 

I might be able to find a DVD on Amazon for $10 but the same DVD from a retailer that accepts Bitcoin charges $20 in Bitcoin. Now if I was making a political statement and a sincere Bitcoiner I would buy the more expensive product just to prove Bitcoin works. However I am just a normal person that has a normal job and I want a bargain and free delivery. Right now Bitcoin is more difficult to acquire than regular money, more difficult to spend and costs me more to use.

The deal isn't sounding too good so far. I like the idea. Electronic money that's easy to actually use and transact business but the negatives are not helping.

A wrong calculation means you have a bunch of foreign coins in your pocket that can't buy very much with but will also be completely useless when you get home. In the latter case you wander around the departure lounge spending money on an extra coffee you don't want or some chocolate just to get rid of the spare change.

With Bitcoin I feel the same way. I have the coins, or at least 0.1 of a coin, but I am circling around potential retailers on the Internet just to spend it. I almost want to spend it because I want it to be a real currency, real money. However I am in that departure lounge. Limited choice and a wallet with some Bitcoins that are not useful in my real life in the real world. For me spending Bitcoins is like a sort of financial departure lounge. Yes I can buy that large cushion from Overstockers because they will take my Bitcoins but it will cost twice as much as my local store and take 6 weeks to ship to England. My only consolation is that I will have spent and alternative currency and stuck it to the Bank of England.",cryptocurrency,1402432300
personalfinance,Changed jobs have need esop options/advice,"So I changed jobs sometime during the last 6 months. Former employer is esop owned. Got an email from the CFO stating that they need to buy out what shares I had in the company. This is totally expected from when I resigned. I have what seems to be 2 options at this point. take a cash distribution, which would be nice to make some upgrades to my house, or two roll it into a retirement account of some kind. If I roll it into a retirement account there are no penalties or taxes involved at this time. If I take the cash option they will take 20 percent for federal taxes but any state taxes or penalties are on me come April 2015.

Sorry for being so long winded but would you take door number one or door number two at this point? I have not yet set up a 401k at my new employers but am setting aside cash in a savings to make additional contributions after I am eligible to sign up.

personalfinance,"My husband and I own a small business, make almost 1/3 of the income we used to, and feel like we're bleeding money. Where do we go from here?","Some (approximate) stats:

My income: $2000/month after insurance, taxes, etc.

Debt: $3000 in one student loan, $2000 in another student loan, $5000 in a car payment. All the same interest rates.

Savings: $40,000, $30,000 of which is in a separate CMA account that we'd really love to not touch.

My husband does our business full time, and is making about $1500/month after expenses, which we have to put straight back into the business.

Our expenses are largely non-negotiable: 

$1000 rent and utilities

$660 doctor (this should go down a good chunk next month!)

$280 gas

$320 all extra spending (entertainment, alcohol, out to eat, dates, etc.) I know this is definitely the biggest one that can be changed.

$50 Internet (mandatory for business)

$80 cell

$300 car payment, $100 student loan payments

$300 grocery

$55 tithing

$20 gym

Without any extra expenditures at all (clothes, auto insurance 2x year, oil changes, Rx, birthdays, etc.), and EVEN IF we drop the entertainment/extra spending budget down to $50/month total, we're still losing over $800/month.

We want to be wise with our money and make good decisions, but we're really not sure of our next steps. Would it be better to pay off some loans and lose a chunk of our savings while we're already losing so much every month, but lose the monthly payments and potential interest? Or try to hold out for long enough on savings until the business makes a profit we can take a salary from? Some third option?

crypto,"Hi, can someone please look at this protocol for exchanging RSA encrypted packets of Bitcoin keys and see if it is valid","UPDATE: 

* abandoning the verification code idea
* replacing the shaHash with private key signature of the encrypted packet
* changing the RSA implementation (need to research)
* verifying the AES encyrption is implemented properly

Massive thanks to rya_nc for analysing this

**The problem**

Two users Alice and Bob.

alice and bob each have a packet of data AES encrypted with a password only they know.

	AliceAESPacket
	BobAESPacket

The AESPackets contain an RSA key pair which they will use for encrypted communication with each other. The AESPackets also contains 3 Bitcoin BIP32 root public keys.

They will use these root keys to generate 3 derived bitcoin public keys whcih they will exchange with each other.

Their RSA public keys are available on a server.

The exchange

1. Alice decrypts her AES encrypted packet with her password, gets the root keys and derives 3 public Bitcoin keys for Bob

	BitcoinKeyForBob1 = Bip32Hot.Derive(node);
	BitcoinKeyForBob2 = Bip32Cold.Derive(node);
	BitcoinKeyForBob3 = Bip32Us.Derive(node);

2. She downloads Bob's RSA public key from the server and encrypts the 3 Bitcoin public keys using Bob's RSA public key. She signs the encrypted packet with her private RSA key.

	RSAEncryptedPacketForBob = BobRSAPublic.Encrypt(BitcoinKeyForBob1 + BitcoinKeyForBob2 + BitcoinKeyForBob3)

3. Alice posts the encrypted packet to the server and Bob is notified that it is available

4. Bob downloads the RSAEncryptedPacketForBob and decrypts with BobRSAPrivateKey.
5. Bob verifies the signature against alice's public RSA key

6. Bob then AES encrypts BitcoinKeyForBob1, BitcoinKeyForBob2 and BitcoinKeyForBob3 using his private password and stores in BobAESPacket

7. The RSAEncryptedPacketForBob is deleted from the server.

8. Out of band Bob and Alice validate RSA signatures, until this is done they cannot send funds

9. Generating an address

	Bob decrypts his BobAESPacket using his password and derives an address for Alice using BitcoinKeyReceived1 + BitcoinKeyReceived2 + BitcoinKeyReceived3
	

**Attack Vector**

Eve intercepts step 4

4. Alice posts the encrypted packet to the server &gt;&gt;&gt;atack start&gt;&gt;&gt;

	RSAEncryptedPacketForBob = BobRSAPublic.Encrypt(EveBitcoinKey1 + EveBitcoinKey2 + EveBitcoinKey3)

personalfinance,"Discontinue ""Bank on Yourself"" policy?","Okay PF, I need some advice, preferably from those that are familiar with the Bank on Yourself/Infinite Banking Concept. 

I currently have about $45k in secured/student/credit card loans. Average rate is 8-10% APR. About $20k of that is from a home remodel I did that went over budget (surprise, surprise) which caused me to tap into my personal line of credit at my bank.

The good news is from my remodel, the tenants pay the mortgage, I live rent free in a studio, and I net about $600 mo. which I use to snowball my debts. ($400 for debt snowball, $200 for home/property reserves)

My scenario: I've been paying into my life insurance policy for about 20 months. Monthly premium is $509, and the PUA is set to expire in year 10, where the guaranteed dividend would be enough to wash out the premium, so it would be ""self-sustaining"". After year 10, I would have about $54k guaranteed or $64k non-guaranteed in cash value to borrow against and I'll have about $350k in death benefit. My intent was to use this as a future savings/personal loan account. Not money I need currently but something to build for the future.

Does anyone have any magical cost-benefit/opportunity cost formula that helps illustrate where the $509/mo premium could be better served? Maybe discontinuing the life insurance, and use the $509 to pay down the debts, and invest in my 401k once the debts are paid?

Also, another note. I currently contribute 10% to my employer sponsored 401k. I have my expenses budgeted so that my annual salary covers all my expenses. Min. pmnts for debt, food, clothing, health insurance, auto, utilities, life insurance, etc. I plan on using my quarterly bonuses to pay the debt down further, which should be paid down in 1.5 years, according to the nifty spreadsheet I downloaded from here. 

So it's not like I'm not stretching to make the life insurance premium, just wondering if it could be better served?

**Edit 1**: Thanks for the responses everyone. I was hoping to get more specific ideas of cost/benefit of putting the money to work somewhere else, not someone telling me what a bad idea the whole life policy is. 

My plan wasn't to use it as an investment, but as a way to build savings to borrow against, but now I'm thinking using that money towards investments could be better served, especially since compounding is on my side. Here's some more info about my finances.

Quick run down: we own two cars in full, rent a house, no credit card debt. Only debt to speak of is student loans (see below).


Pre-tax household income = 135k. Due to new jobs, this is a good 30k higher than it was before.
Monthly spending (including non-essentials) = roughly 4k


Ages: 28


Assets:

* Liquid cash: 20k
* 401k: 14k (i know... i know...)
* Brokerage account: 18k
* Two used cars: we'll probably run them into the ground


Debts:

* Student loans: 33k


Grandparents opened the brokerage account for me. Mostly index funds and some bonds. I've contributed to it over the years.


Our goals are:


* We want to buy a house before interest rates climb too high in the next 1-2 years. We were planning on it already, but the timing seems pretty good, and we should be able to avoid PMI
* We’d like to pay off the student loans
* We’d like to get back to contributing more to retirement


We’re fortunate to have good jobs, and as such, we’re currently netting 3k+ per month, which will go a long way towards the above. 


**Our current plan is:**
 
A. Get back to submitting the maximum amount to our 401ks at our jobs.

B. We have the savings and brokerage account earmarked for a down payment on a house (50k), which we should have saved up by roughly early next year.

C. Tackle the student loans as hard as we can after that. We’re paying slightly more than the minimum right now. 

D. We know to keep enough in a emergency fund when considering the down payments and student loans.

Thank G-d, I live within my means and I'm able to pay bills and manage my finances (Google Drive Spreadsheets, traditional budgeting), but I want to climb higher, be more well-versed, make investments, play smart, etc. I read a bit of Ramit Sethi's site/blog, as well as articles about finance on LifeHacker... like that says much, but it's something.


Incoming:

* Gross monthly income (I'm paid hourly, so if I work *exactly* 40hr/wk) = $2030.72 (oftentimes I work more -- and if I'm at work less, welp, then I'm paid less, but it usually evens out somewhere).
I get 0 benefits at work: no 401K, health care, insurance, investments, retirement, etc.
Paid vacation is when I would take off anyway; otherwise, I'm ONLY paid for when I work (one week I got paid for 39hrs, another for 41hrs 1min... yoi. Reality, I guess...)


Expenses/Outgoing (planned budget):

* Minimal of 10% of my earnings go direct to charity (so really, that leaves $1827.65 monthly)
* Rent = $525 + $25 utils
* Groceries = max $400/mo (ie $100/wk, which I don't think I've ever spent. I do my best to be very thrifty. Thank G-d I have a full pantry and I definitely over-buy... just downloaded [Out of Milk](https://www.outofmilk.com/) for that purpose ;))

* I often get rides to/from work, so no car, car payments, maintenance, gas, tolls, etc. (truth is, I don't even have a license!) Sometimes I do need public transportation, so I take that as needed.
* $350/mo or ~$87/wk for extra/other/buffer (shopping/clothes, misc expenses [soap, eating out, etc.])
* Debt = $2800 total left @ ~$275/mo [sometimes I pay more, depending].
Otherwise, other debts I have is just regular credit card 'debt,' which I auto-pay in full monthly (I have one credit card, since 2007).

Savings/Investments:

* Transfer [at least] $250/mo into savings

I'm currently participating in the [52 Week Money Challenge](http://www.52weekmoneychallenge.net/), so as to put away a lil bit more.

Most advice I've read says to have 3-6mo worth of income in savings for emergency fund -- working my way up there, slowly but surely.

I may have some other investments somewhere, but I'd have to ask around to see what's the story.

* Out of debt
* Earning more money

We always knew that PayPal fees were high but until we calculated it today... this is insane - we processed $245,301.46 of sales so far this year through PayPal and the fees come out to be **$29,148.20!**

The ""normal"" PayPal fees were $11,256.86…  
The ""hidden"" PayPal FOREX fees were $5,626.26…  
The Seller Platform fees were $12,265.07…  
Total = $29,148.20…  

##The Analysis  
Let's delve deeper. The advertised PayPal fees were $11,256.86. We are incorporated outside of the US just fyi and this turns out to be 4.6%. Ok I can still live with that.

The ridiculous part is the FOREX fees of $5,626.26. Since we serve US customers we process in USD so as soon as we figured out that there are FOREX fees we were ready to outsmart PayPal and use our multi-currency account to withdraw to USD rather than to the local currency!

But unless you have a bank account in the US, PayPal COCK-BLOCK you from withdrawing to USD and you HAVE to withdraw to the local currency so they can hit you w/ hidden additional fees! 

And then the seller platform. We'll keep them nameless because they do provide a decent service and we know the owners but still 5% is yet another huge chuck.

We also have a 90 day reserve, so we have to wait 3 months for $45K USD to pay suppliers and staff (all philippines based, via paypal where they get hit w/ more fees) 

##The Retaliation  
We just came out with a new eCommerce Adult Toy Shop and decided that we will ONLY accept Bitcoin with this business and any new business endeavor!  

-PayPal's not getting a cut…  
-The bank's not getting a cut…  
-No one's going to interfere, we will keep all proceed as btc…  
This is why Bitcoin will succeed there are a ton of businesses like ours who are fed up with huge cuts and processing times.

personalfinance,"Question About Consolidation, Emergency Funds, and Savings While Carrying Debt","I am 25 years old, 2+ years at my current job with a salary of 70K.  But this question always boggles me - *How much in Emergency Fund/savings when you have debt?*

My Student Loan interest rates are not good, and they are all I think about. So my focus has been paying as much as I can into my highest interest loans while keeping around 5-6K in my bank to cover costs and safety net.  My dilemna (as I'm sure many others) is just am I doing this the right way, do I have enough to cover myself for the *just in case*, and should I consolidate:


- Roughly 12,000 at an average of 10% interest on my private loans
- Roughly 18,000 on federal loans average of 5% interest

So almost every month I pay an extra $500-1K towards the highest interest Private loan.  After my expenses that leaves me enough to operate in my Bank account (consultant so I need money to cover trips, etc until I am reimbursed). I'm starting to feel pressure about saving more money to buy a house, car, move, engagement ring, etc and I've realized that because of my situation I don't save money at all.  Should I actually build some savings for the future, or is my focus on my debt what I should be doing?

Yesterday I also applied to consolidate my Private Student Loans.  I was thinking of going variable interest rate because since I should be able to pay off that 12K in the next 2 years I figure I can take the risk.  If I could get an interest rate of even something like 7%, some rough rough math says I would save 500-1K a year on the interest alone.  

Just looking for some suggestions, thoughts, or even just validation to keep doing what I'm doing :)  - I know my situation is better than most my age that is why I'm trying to make sure I make the right choices right now.",finance,1402500526

personalfinance,Graduate School Loans &amp; Current State of my Finances,"Hello all -

As some of you may have noticed, this is my first foray into reddit, so I do apologize if I slip up along the way. I have been lurking for years, so I *think* I get the gist of it.

I wanted to present the current state of my finances, and look for some advice moving forward. I will be starting graduate school in the fall (Part time MBA, evenings), for which I will be funding the entire endeavor via student loans (I think?). I was very fortunate in that my parents paid for my undergraduate, so I am currently not saddled with any student loan debt, as many of my friends are. Anyways, here is the current state of my finances:

*Age: 29
* Income: 
* Salary (NET): $4,834/mo


* Expenses: 
* Phone: $80/mo
* Cable/Internet: $80/mo
* Water: $14/mo
* Gas: $14/mo
* Electricity: $30/mo (fluctuates greatly between winter/summer, this is an average)
* Credit Monitoring: $11/mo (get rid of this?)
* Groceries: $300/mo
* Rent: $1,218 (this seems high to some, but where I live it is what it is - it's actually cheap compared to some folks).
* Renters Insurance: $17/mo (required).
* Restaurants/Bars: $300/mo (I enjoy eating fine foods/wines, so cut me a bit of slack !)
* Golf: $150/mo - I play twice a month, usually.
* Taxis: $25/mo
* Miscellaneous: $100/mo - occasional clothes purchases, gifts, etc.
*Travel: $300/mo. I don't travel every month, but this is based on flights/vacations each year. Traveling is a hobby of mine.
* Savings: $1000/mo.
* **Total: 3,639**

Note: This leaves about $1,200/mo unaccounted for. What tends to happen is that I have this extra money in my checking and I do stupid shit with it. I bought some art I really loved. I went out to a super fancy dinner. I throw some extra in savings. I buy a flight somewhere for my g/f and I and take a few days off work. I take a bunch of my friends out and pay the bill. I buy video game consoles. I ENJOY these things. You can say I am being stupid, and often times I am, but I often struggle with work as a means to life or work AS my life, so that's what happens. I never spend more than I earn in a month, so that's positive and hey, at least I am on here being honest, right?

* Assets: 
* $13,942 in savings (emergency fund + some). Earns basically shit in a savings account at .03%, but is GROWING approx $1K/mo. 
* $14K in stocks. Returned 21% last year. Returning 9% so far this year (obviously, this can change in an instant, I know).
* $1,200 in bitcoins. Say what you want, I already cashed out my original investment so they are free as far as I am concerned, but I do understand that they are speculative.
* $30K in 401(k) - contribute 7.5% - company just stopped matching, but it used to be 12% with matching until last week.



* Liabilities/Debt:
* Currently: negligible. I pay off my CC bill each month in full. 
* Forward Looking: 
* Graduate School: **~$80K in loans.** (I have questions about this)
* $41,000 at 6.21% - Direct Unsubsidized (2 yrs, hence double max)
* $39,000 at 7.21% - Direct PLUS Loan


Ok, so, according to the side bar, I think I am doing *ok*. I have an emergency fund. I was putting more than 10% of my earnings into 401(k) (should I up it now that they don't match?). I have zero debt. My credit score is 705, which is OK, but that's only because I messed up about 6-7 years ago and let some stuff slip/go to collections. I fixed it all eventually, it just seems to be taking time to fully repair. I do have a credit card with a $12K limit and I don't really need my credit for the foreseeable future (4-5 years until house purchase), so I am OK with that.

My main questions/concerns:

1. **Anything to do to improve my current situation?** I am guessing that most people will say ""up your 401K to the max since you have money left over"", and if that is the consensus, I will most likely do so. I am also guessing you will say ""stop spending money on stupid shit,"" which, as I learn to budget better (started using Mint), I will certainly take into account.

2. **Student loans: Best approach here?** Those interest rates are high, I know. I can pay the loans down pretty quickly, and the interest will at least be a tax credit. But, given that I already have extra income, should I just pay as much as possible in cash? Pay the loans with a CC and earn points? If I am aggressive I believe I can pay down the loans in less than 3 yrs ($2,200/mo x 36), but that means no savings. Although, with completion of MBA and potentially CPA, that means large increase in income.

3. **Engagement Ring:**I will be purchasing one in the next 6 months or so. Approx $15K. Any suggestions as to best way to do this? Use a CC and earn points? Pay in cash?

Ok, I think that is it for now. I *really* enjoy reading the responses/suggestions you guys have for everyone. I do believe I am at a point in my life that I am making some good financial decisions, and I have certainly made some bad ones in the past, but I can probably make some *better* ones moving forward.

I also have a car loan with 4 years left which is 9K at 2.9% My car payment is $211/mo

personalfinance,"New Grad, Trying to figure out the best way to meet my personal finance goals...","I just graduated college for engineering, and will be starting a new job one month from now that will give me an **after-tax income of $4200 per month.** after a 10% contribution to my 401k (according to paycheck calculators).


Before I start my job, I really need to buy a car. I've been looking around a ton, and I decided I really love the Honda Fit. However, the model holds its value so well that buying new seems like the most ""bang for your buck"" vs used. So that wound up my plan. The car is going to be about 18k out the door. I have about **20k in my bank accounts right now** (that's all the money I have anywhere besides around **6k in a Roth IRA**). Because I will need money to buy furniture and etc. when I get to my new job I don't want to pay for the car outright, so I will finance some of it. I was thinking like a 7.5k downpayment. I have really good credit so my interest rate shouldn't be more than 3-something percent (as far as I can gather from Google).


It'll take about **$500 for me to move** myself and my stuff down to the city where I'll start work. I'll be receiving a **relocation bonus of 6.5k post-tax** so that will offset a lot of my upcoming expenses.


In September I will need to pay **4k for my part-time grad school** (working toward an MS in Engineering). I will hopefully be reimbursed for this cost by my company after the semester ends, though it depends on my grade (must get a B or better, though given my record I should be able to do that just fine).


So to extract the info out of the above paragraphs:


Positives:

* 20k in bank account currently

* 6k in Roth IRA currently

* 6.5k after tax relocation bonus

* 4.2k after tax and 401k income starting next month


Negatives:

* 18k total cost of car I might buy (might do 7.5k downpayment)

* 4k grad school bill in september

* $500 to move to new city

* Furniture/Stuff for new apartment (no idea what this will cost)


Here are some of my monthly expenses once I do start my job:

* $625 rent

* $200 food (estimated from when I lived on my own in past summers)

* $300 car payment (rough estimate from a calculator)

* $100 on gas (or less, I'll be carpooling and I'll live only a couple miles from work anyway)

* $200 Utilities (internet, electricity, water)? Maybe a high estimate, but it's hot where I'm going so I won't be able to survive without the AC on most of the time. I have a roommate so this is my half.

* $150 car insurance? I have no idea if that's a good estimate? 22yr old female?

* $50 cell phone bill


So basically, these are my questions:

* Am I spending too much on the car? I am normally very frugal, so the thought of this much money leaving my hands is scary. That said, I want something nice and reliable that I will keep for years to come. 

* Is my budget a reasonable guess? Are there big mandatory expenses I'm forgetting about? I left out nonessentials like ""eating out"" because I can't come up with a good estimate in advance...

* Will I have the capacity to save for big things like a wedding and an eventual house?

* Any general financial advice? I'm intimidated by the slew of big expenses coming up for me in the next few months, and a little overwhelmed at starting my independent, away-from-home-and-college life.

personalfinance,"I have $380,000 in student loan debt. Help!","Hello, personalfinance. I've lurked this subreddit for a couple of months and thought I'd take a stab at asking for advice. I read through this thread in its entirety and found it very helpful: http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/27ailn/advice_for_high_federal_loan_total_520000/  From that thread I learned the avalanche method, avoiding lifestyle inflation, etc.


I graduated dental school in May 2013 with $342,765 (now 379,513 after interest) of debt and have spent the last year in a general residency making $40k/year pre-tax. The loans have been in forbearance during this time. Next month, my loan repayment will kick in and I'm not exactly sure how to proceed, especially because there will be an approximate 1-month down-time where I am between jobs not making any income.


Starting in August, I will be working for one year in a community clinic making $90,000 per year. This is very low for a dentist, but I made this decision to work here for personal, rather than financial reasons (for better or worse). After this year, I hope to go into private practice making substantially more.


I went on studentloans.gov and they used my loan information to give me projections of the various payment methods. I took a screenshot of the results here: http://i.imgur.com/8lCbuTS.jpg
With all that said, here are some questions.


1. With this massive debt load, what's the best way of proceeding? It seems like going with the Pay As You Earn is far and away the best choice according to my loan payment projections: (http://i.imgur.com/8lCbuTS.jpg). What's the catch? Is the catch that I have to pay taxes on the forgiven loans?


2. Does Pay As You Earn/Income Based Repayment allow me to make minimal payments on my low-interest loans and maximize my payments on my high-interest loans?


3. Should I consolidate my loans?


4. What's the best way of bridging the time from the end of my residency to the start of my job in August? Something like IBR or PAYE?

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation Advice - Interest Rate Questions,"Hi all,

Discover sent me an invite to consolidate all my loans with them. The total debt I have is around $81,000. Of course they gave me the option of fixed or variable rate loans. 

Now, my intrest rate for variable would be about 3-Month LIBOR +5% (5.25% now), where as the fixed would be about 8.25%. I also get a small discount for direct deposit on top of that (.25 I think).

The average APR of my loans now are around 6.25%. 

I tried to search as much as I can to get an idea of future predictions for the 3 mo LIBOR, but I am sure these sources are not very accurate. But, even if I hedge on the high side for how fast the rate will ramp up, it seems after 10 years I do better with the variable rate (even better if I factor in an increased wage over those years). 

When I look at just keeping the loans as is, it is much closer since the average rate is lower than 8%. 

What would you guys do? A couple loans I have are 7 and 7.5%, maybe just consolidate those?

Bitcoin,My reviews of bitcoin exchanges and services my business used,"Over the past weeks myself (a 23 year old from Vancouver, Canada) &amp; my business partner (a 21 Regensburg, Germany) have tried a lot of different XBT exchanges and sellers. He reddits a lot and suggested I type up what I wrote down about our experience to share them with you. 

**Great experiences**:

**Kraken** - 9.8

***General***: Kraken is one of the better platforms we used, mostly when dealing with the Euro. We opened a Kraken account, made a $5000 USD deposit and a €7000 deposit and were ready to begin trading in under 24 hours. We ran into no problems with them, our orders filled quickly and the emails that we had with their team were fairly straight forward. More payment methods would make them a 10.

***Pros***:  They have many pair listings, special types of trading orders including stop loss, take profit, and others. They accept SEPA payments for Euro and bank wires for most other deposits. They have good security practices (https://www.kraken.com/security/practices) and have done an audit with proof of solvency (https://www.kraken.com/security/audit). Well known team, public facing. Has LTC, NameCoin and Ripple.

***Cons***: Does not accept ACH payments for US users. Lack's transparency of cost on USD bankwires (TBD*). Some users have raised concerns over the pasts of the investment team (this had no impact on score but should be mentioned). Support team was quick and solved our problems.

**Bitstamp** - 9.5

***General***: Bitstamp is a market leader and great exchange. We had a very good experience with them. They are probably our default choice if we had to use a general USD exchange to run an ATM or something. We made a deposit of $15,000 USD and trading went smoothly. It is important to note this exchange we withdrew only in Bitcoin, we did not try the Fiat withdrawals. Full transparency could make them a 10.

**Pros**: Large volume, great liquidity, fairly quick to get an account open and money deposits. Our time from opening an account to trading was under 24 hours. They take a decently low fee .5% Has a proof of reserves audit by third-party.

**Cons**: Audit is third-party and not proof of solvency. Little is known about management team. Bankwires are only real method to be used here. Does not allow trading in non-USD. Trades are only do Bitcoin. Many claims of Bitstamp freezing users Bitcoin under AML/KYC claims and asking for lots  information such as signed wallets proving source of those coins (We did not experience this).

**Vault of Satoshi** - 9.2

***General***: Vault of Satoshi is a much smaller exchange then the other ""great"" exchanges but they do really awesome things for XBT. Their team was very supportive and really quick. We had our account open, verified and trading in under an hour ON A SUNDAY. It was the fastest set up time of any exchange that deals with fiat currency. For user experience and security they would be our top pick. International support and higher volume could make them a high 9 if not a 10.

***Pros***: High security (http://www.reddit.com/r/vos/comments/27hd8d/are_my_coins_safe_on_vos/ci0yeua) and transparency including daily generation of Proof of Solvency audits, very transparent team (https://www.vaultofsatoshi.com/about) who are active on Reddit. Allows trading of over 20 coins to both fiat and to any other coin. Has Interac deposits for Canadians, they apparently can take an hour or two to enter the account, but ours took maybe ten minutes. Easily the fastest deposit method we found. 

***Cons***: Pretty much just for Canadians unless you transfer coins in for day trading. Supposed to be expanding soon. Volume was lower but seems to be picking up. Needs a lot of personal information. Would be great to see more payment methods outbound.

**Good Experiences**:

**Coinbase** - 8.7

***General***: Coinbase is a great service, backed with good money and clearly a very secure environment. Being a dual resident and citizen I was able to use Coinbase for some of our purchases via my US bank account. It was really quick to open an account and get buying. We bought around $5000 worth of Bitcoin to send into other coin-only exchanges. The support staff were helpful, but could have been trained a bit more about Bitcoin knowledge. Overall things went really well. More coins, international support and proof of solvency could put it up to a 9.

***Pros***: Clear set price not dealing with any ""orderbooks"", great platform very easy and straight foward to user. Great for new users. Has ACH payments for American Users so you don't have to do a bankwire. It is backed by a major investors. Has stable relationships with a bank unlike many other small exchanges. It is fast, secure, and friendly support staff.

***Cons***: Not a full exchange, US only, support can be slow to respond, has no proof of reserves, promotes the use of online wallet services. Does not allow you to buy or sell coins other than XBT.

**Cryptsy** - 7.2

***General***: Was used for dealing with smaller altcoins that weren't on other exchanges. Our total volume on there was roughly 8 BTC. Deposits went fairly smoothly, although we did have to contact support in regards to one submission of Blackcoin that did not appear in our balance. The support team was slow and rather rude but did get the job done eventually.

***Pros***: No verification needed for trades, deposit and go. Lots of currency pairs. High volumes. Strong platform. Great chart features. Great price ticker on the side.

***Cons***: No proof of funds, not much security, doesn't support fiat, support team is kind of a pain to deal with if something does go wrong. Should really only use if you are day trading

**QuadrigaCX**- 7.0

***General***: QuadrigaCX is a small Canadian exchange. All around a decent service we only did around $500 transaction with them in order to do a quick test but we were quite happy with the Canadian provider we had selected. These guys are decent backup. It took less than 48 hours to get my account open and trading. If they had proof of solvency and support staff then we would have likely given them an 8 or a 9.

**Pros**: Low fee (0.5%), has book for XBT/AU (gold). Has online interac payments.

**Cons**: Not large books, no proof of solvency, lower transparency, called contact number twice during operation hours and got voicemail, email response was next day and was short but answered my questions.

**InstaBT** - 6.5

***General***: These guys are similar in concept to a Coinbase. It's small limit purchases of XBT instantly. Site looks a little dodgy but they are an accepted payment method on Vault of Satoshi so we decided to give them a try for about $100 in XBT.

***Pros***: It was quick and easy and did not require any type of I.D. verification. We had a support phonecall and the guy seemed friendly enough. Lower fees would make this method a 7.

***Cons***: Has limits and really high fees. I think the fee was around 9%. 

**QuickBT** - 6.4

***General****: These guys are pretty much the same as above, although rather than being used for Vault of Satoshi they are used for CAvirtex. The service was all in all the same, nicer website, did $100 in XBT. Only reason for the lower score is when they guy called me to verify my phone number he was a bit of a grump. Lower fees and friendly support would increase their score.

***Pros***: Quick online interac without verification

***Cons***: Guy was a bit of a grump, and had really high fees.

**Bad Experiences**

**CAVirtex** - 4

***General***: CAvirtex is a Canadian only exchange. If I am not mistaken it's the oldest one around. They only do XBT and LTC. We did about $10,000 through them before we started exploring other options. A number of accusations have been posted in this sub against them that make them questionable, but their user support, slow time in dealing with funds and general attitude towards there users is what got them the low score from us. There would need to be lots of changes to raise their score.

**Pros**: Usually the price is a few bucks cheaper here than at other exchanges, not sure why though. You can withdraw your money to a pre-paid debit card.

**Cons**: In our experience we found it extremely slow to get started. We tried to open an account and it was almost a week before we got verified. We made a deposit via Direct Debit (EFT) and it took about a week before it showed up in our account. When we tried to reach out to support about this it took 3 days before we got a snippy reply. All in all we were not impressed. It's not how people should handle customers.

**The Rock Trading** - 2.5

***General***: We had decided to try this Malta based e-trading platform with our Euro funds. The exchange is rather small but has some ok features. Ultimately we only did about €700 before we got fed up using them. They support SEPA payments which is great but their support team could not give a shit about you. 

***Pros*** SEPA payments, lots of currency support, BTC shares

***Cons***: By far the worst support around

**LocalBitcoins** - No Score

***General***: Localbitcoins pairs you with sellers in your area, digitally or by meet up and then exchange Bitcoin. Before we got into exchanges I had done maybe $2500 through localbitcoin purchases. You always end up over paying, you have to meet up with the person which is time consuming and you never know who you are going to get. 

***Pros***: The only real advantage to this method is that you aren't going through an exchange and having to verify. It allows those who are worried about their identity to keep it secure

***Cons***: You end up way over paying for the bitcoins that you purchase, you never know who you are going to get and some users have even been mugged at such meetups. In my case I arranged to meet someone and waited over an hour at the meetup spot and no one showed up.

personalfinance,PMI...Is it worth it in order to maintain liquid emergency fund?,"I am buying a house and weighing my financing options - please do not recommend that I NOT buy the house as that decision has been made already.

**Details:**

Home Price: 340,000

Liquid Assets to my name: 75,000

20% Down Payment + Closing Costs + Prepaids:  ~ 73,000 +/- 500.




**Putting 20% down would suck up nearly all of my liquid assets (including my emergency fund).   My job is stable and I am leaning towards doing this anyway, despite the erasure of my emergency fund because of the following:**

1) As stated previously, my job is stable.

2)  In the worst-case scenario where I would suddenly need a lot of cash, I could take out a HELOC against the 20% I own.

3)  I don't know the formula for how to calculate PMI charges, but at 15% down (from a fees worksheet disclosed by my Credit Union), it appears to be about the same as a 1/4 point interest rate increase on the payment.   This money could be used to rebuild my emergency fund.





**However, the other part of me says:**

1)  My understanding is that on a conventional loan, PMI is knocked off automatically when I reach 20-22% equity, depending on the lender.  Why risk having to go further into debt for an emergency when you can just make an additional principal payment sometime later when you are flush with money and get PMI knocked off at a better time.   Alternatively, if the house improves in value in the short term, I could get the property re-appraised and get PMI knocked off in that fashion.

All in all, settled on a salary that is more than what I make now. Thank you for all your input! Will be putting in my notice today!



Im currently making 45k (California).  Was promised medical/dental and vision at the end of my 90s days.  90 days has come and gone and still nothing.  This wasnt a huge deal breaker until my car got t-boned and I had to go to the doctors.  Eventually it will get reimbursed but I had to pay out of pocket for a few things.  

Pay has also been habitually late.  Not by a lot, 1-3 days usually.  Just enough to start becoming a pain in the ass.

I was given a job offer today for 40K with full benefits all paid for at the end of 90 days and a 401k with a 3% match.  They also have a meal allowance program which adds an additional 1820 to my 40k.  Also, id be non-exempt so over time pay, although not banking on this as OT will most likely be scarce. It is however an additional 20 mile commute.  Currently, my commute is 8 miles one way.  New job would be 18.

I claim 0 on my taxes and am single... Eventually I think the boss will get the benefits rolling but im growing more and more frustrated at his lack of give a fucks.  No 401 any time soon.
 
Not sure if PF is where I should be posting this but i could really use some feed back.. Would taking the pay cut be worth it..? I would definitely be on a tighter budget since the car that just got tboned is only 3 months old.

Car: 215.94

Food: 350
Entertainment: 200ish

Bitcoin,Something I do not understand. No tinfoil hats please.,"When the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the rules were written so that US money would be created in a transaction between the Treasury and The Fed.  The Treasury gives the Fed an IOU for $106, and the Fed prints $100 to give to the Treasury, who gives it to politicians who spend it on ketchup flow rate studies.

Notice the 6% missing?  That goes to the shareholders of the Federal Reserve.  Private banks.  They earn 6% on deposits as a dividend.  This is why a ""balanced budget"" and a ""debt ceiling"" are silly terms.  If we balanced the budget our monetary system would collapse into a deflationary spiral.  It generates 6% debt by default, so balancing the budget or enforcing a debt ceiling would require default on debt, and cause the system to collapse and die almost instantly.

Then we have our retail banks multiplying money supply on reserve requirements, making even more interest by lending money that other people deposit.  I'm unclear how lending out funds worth 40x as many funds worth 1 unit of currency in a complex, money multiplier fractional reserve fashion is any better than lending out 1x as many funds worth 40x as much, other than allowing a central authority to manipulate money supply through reserve requirements.  Why do we need this, exactly?  Is it really worth it to give 10% of our GDP to banks n order to generate feedback loops and boom/bust cycles?

Anyways, now I have long since put away my tinfoil hat and decided to summarily ignore people like Thomas Friedman and Paul Krugman who wouldn't be willing to talk about this fact openly in ordinary language if their lives depended on it.

Here is what I don't get.  In 1913 we had to print and manage cash.  6% is a ridiculous fee but I can see how you could justify it to a bought politician who was willing to dupe their constituency.

Here is the thing.  In 1913 there weren't many telephones.  Computers did not exist.  Printing money is now 1s and 0s in a ledger.

So, why do the owners of the Fed still earn 6%?  

Why do we need reserve requirements and fractional reserve lending, especially when they clearly cause systemic instability?  How is any of this modern, efficient, or in any way worth it?

Also, why is it not disclosed anywhere who these entities are?  The entire system is horribly inefficient, anachronistic, and corruptible.  With that kind of power after 100 years I expect some better results.  Most of the earth's population is living in poverty and entirely disconnected from the modern economy.  Time to step it up.

personalfinance,Downsides to consolidating student loans + PAYE,"25, single, $25k @ 6% total in student loans (9K subsidized stafford, the rest is mixed sub/unsub direct). Current take home is $1500/mo, paying total of $355/mo on loans covering the minimum on the smallest interest rates and overpaying on the largest one. They will be paid off in 7 years at this rate. Contributing up to company match on 401K and slowly working on an emergency fund at the same time, currently at about 2 months worth of expenses. My budgeting isn't the greatest, but I'm living comfortably within my means.

After reading about recent changes to the PAYE program, I've been investigating it as one of my options in reducing both monthly payments and overall outlay for these loans. According to the studentloan.gov calculator- and if I'm being accurate plugging in my data- my payments this year would drop to $23/mo, which is a pretty significant change. It would eventually leave me with approximately 18K forgiven if my income adjusts according to their model, so I know I'd need to work on setting aside money for that eventual tax bill. Consolidating would also cost me another .25% interest, since I'm currently benefiting from the auto-pay rate incentive and I don't believe that's available on consolidated Direct loans, but I think that even without it, the rounding would put me in basically the same place.

I absolutely hate where I am and what I do though, so I'm hoping in the next year to leave this job to either freelance (I'm a cellist, hire me!) or go back to school for my terminal degree. Being that I'm a musician, I'm trying to be realistic in my projection of maximum income down the road, so a sudden huge jump in income isn't something I'm concerned with affecting my payments on PAYE. I do, however, worry that I will have a long stretch of time until I have a consistent student and gig base where a $300/mo student loan bill would be a significant concern if I stay on the standard plan.

To me, this seems like something of a silver bullet in my back pocket, but since we're also dealing with the government here, I'm concerned that I'm overlooking something(s).",finance,1402584440
personalfinance,How much in the next generation?,"Everything is expensive nowadays, correct?  Just think the price of just about everything has increased dramatically in one generation than perhaps ever before.  Have you ever heard your parents reminisce about when the cost of gas was $0.50/gallon?  Or when a loaf of bread was a nickel?  A gallon of milk cost a dime?

I wonder sometimes what bits of information will our memory hold to the next generation?  Can you imagine talking to a son or daughter, 20 or 30yrs from now, about how things were when you were a kid?  My story would probably sound a little like this:

""I remember when I was 16 and got my first car...a used 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  The price of gas would fluctuate anywhere from $0.85 to $1.00/gallon.  I could get by a whole week on $5 depending on how far I drove...which was usually between school, football practice, and home.  Interest rates were high - but I didnt pay too much attention to it because I had no need for a loan at such a young age.  But I do remember when having $20 dollars felt like a lot of money...that meant gas for the entire month!  Milk was like, $1.50 a gallon...I bought my PlayStation 1 for about $100...everything was fairly affordable.

My first job was at Publix Supermarket and I was a grocery bagger...I made about $70 week there working part-time.  No wait, let me back up...my first job - I used to sweep floors at Iron Mountain...up and down those long aisles of anonymous boxes belonging to several companies.  I was 15yrs old and remember I made $5/hr there...I remember my mom telling me that it was a good job and I should be happy. 

Between these two jobs it allowed me to buy my first car - for about $650...which I had saved from working part-time.  By the summer of 1999, before I'd left for college, I was making about $400/week at my 3rd job, which was Ford Motor dealership...I was washing and detailing cars.  I was making enough money to have an apartment and support a small family lol...but I saved mostly every penny to help pay for a few things to get me started for college.""

That was back then...a simple time when a teenager could get a job and buy the simple things in life...a car, clothes, video games, etc.  Now video games start at $400, used car prices are astronomical, food, clothing, etc. have all drastically increased.

So as the global economy expands and wealth is consolidated or concentrated to the global 1%...that means less for the rest of us...or perhaps it means, it will be much harder to live comfortably and maintain your standard of living in the future.  Given these highly probable expectations...or adjustments - what are you doing to adjust accordingly?  What are you doing to prepare the next generation or what are you doing to prepare yourself?

My current plan is to sell my first vesting batch of stocks and my next round of ESPP at the end of the summer to wipe out both the Discover balance and the hideous 9.25% monster from Sallie Mae, which has been plaguing me for far too long.

I live fairly modestly and until my last career change within my immediate means - at present, I contribute the maximum to my ESPP and sell my 'principal' back immediately to pay my credit card off while keeping my 'gains' in the market as my company is doing very well.  I am not positive if this is the best use of my credit or funds, but a guaranteed 15%+ return on the sum I'm investing has thus far trumped interest charges accrued.  Am I being foolish?  

Beyond that, though, I'm stuck and welcome some sage advice.

Limitations:  

Cannot go carless, despite DC metro.  My workplace is not accessible via public transit.  This saddens me.

I could field a second, very part time job, but my FT position is both demanding and erratic at times.

Anything seem crazy out of place here?  

My net worth is currently (not counting the car)  
~$2600, but it will go up by $1400 each month for 7 months, i'm set to have about 4k in my checking account and 8.5k in savings by the end of this year. However, I will get at least $2k back in taxes from the government which will go into savings. (i realize this is super dumb, my parents are strict about some things and they told me that if I didn't listen to them and set the witholdings to the federal government taking as much money as they can out of my paycheck I would be kicked out of the house. otherwise they don't have any affect on my finances, and I figured I could deal with this for one more summer of living with them)  

Does this plan sound alright? Do the numbers line up with what you would expect for me to pay for food insurance and such. Insurance in paid to my parents, I'm on their plan.",finance,1402589219

personalfinance,Private student loans without co-signer or potentially going to community college...and compatibility with my actual goals. Help! I'm completely on my own and lost.,"**TL;DR: Went out on my own very recently, trying to make college work with having huge gaps in money and deciding whether or not private loans are worth it when my final dream is working as an engineer in the international community.**

A couple days ago I decided to leave my house because of the abusive environment. I graduated two weeks ago as a high school senior and was lined up to attend my dream university in the fall but because they based financial aid on my father's previous six figure salary (he was laid off and went from doing very well to making a fourth of what he originally did), he was going to take out a direct parent plus loan for $18,000 and I was going to live at home.

Well, now that I'm out, even with federal loans, I am left with a $27,000 gap (about $10,000 of that is for housing). This is where I have to look at my options and the variables within them:

* Take out private loans. 

Yes, I know you should completely avoid them. But most likely it will only be for this year because next year I will considered legally independent because I was married yesterday to a fellow broke ass college student. Furthermore, I will not be able to have a co-signer because the non-abusive parent (my mom) has bad credit and I have no one else. However, I may be able to get her to still apply for the parent plus loan. She will get rejected because of both income level and shit credit but I've been told they increase federal loans if you get rejected. That means less or maybe nothing to borrow.

* Go to community college.

I'm not entirely sure how much of an option this is because of my current temporary housing. I was taken in on the good will of my best friend's family but I am not currently where I will be for the rest of the summer and where I would be for community college. In order to find out whether it is an option, I need to be there to talk to her parent about whether or not it's ok for me to stay past the summer and I will be there this weekend. I believe as long as I talk to him he should say yes based on what I've been told.

But the real issue I have with community college is I'm almost entirely sure I lose all the scholarships that I was granted as a freshman that made my dream university to just barely out of reach rather than completely. I don't want to entirely lose my opportunity to go there at all because of taking a year off for community college. I do plan on talking to the admissions counselor at my university to see what they say.

However, my overall dream is what matters to me more. I want to work professionally in the international community as an engineer (specifically materials science engineering which is my major) and I will forgo my dream school if the debt wouldn't allow me to work internationally. I have a couple other schools that are state schools so the gap is more like $10,000, though they don't have my specific major.

personalfinance,Just started full time work,"Hey guys so I just started my first full time job where I am making around $850/week after taxes. My rent is $931, my utilities should total around $270 (including internet and cable), and I am estimating around $350-400 for food. Bringing my total monthly costs to ~$1600. That gives me a little over 1600 in excess a month. 

Currently I have $4500 in savings and I keep $1500 in my checking. I know everyone says to get an emergency fund of at least 6 months, but right now that is far out considering I am just starting out. 

My question is how should I go about investing this money on a monthly basis to include in my budget. Should I set aside x dollars a month to my Roth IRA (which I forgot to mention I started last year and have not contributed at all this year to)? Or should I work towards creating an emergency fund? Etc. 

I know I need to keep some liquidity in case something happens, but Having $4500 dollars sitting at a low interest rate seems silly.

personalfinance,Rebuilding my credit -- but I really need a car.,"Hey everyone,

I'm a recent college graduate who has been, honestly, a complete idiot with regards to credit (I have several charged off accounts) and savings (I have none).  

That said, I am about to start a new job with rather long hours in a terrible traffic/bad public transport area, and I just do not want to tack an extra 2 hours of travel time on to an 11-12 hour workday.  Whereas before I was spending credit without any income, I now have a job that will allow me to actually pay my debts responsibly...


Salary: 68000 [plus 15+ expected overtime hours/wk and potential bonus of 15-30%]

Student Loans: 
9k at 3.4%, 
4.5k @ 6.8%, 
2200 @ 4.5% 

I have a 5500 education award to contribute to these debts.

Credit debt: 1500 @ 15%

Revolving account from Dell (my god, I know -- I was 18!): 2200 @ 29.99%.

Expenses: Rent ~800 (not sure, moving into a new place soon)
Cell phone: ~75/mo
Insurance: ~60/mo

I budget food to around 200 month, and gas to 120.

My plan was to use my education award to make payments on my student loans, while throwing everything else at the 29.99% loan from Dell.  I'd have that paid off in 4 weeks.  In 6 weeks, I'd take my next pay check and wipe out my Credit Card debt.  Then I'd be left with just my student loans at a reasonable interest rate.

personalfinance,To take a new job or to not take a new job - that is the question.,"Alright. A lot of info is going to get thrown at you here. Bare with me.

I'm in my mid-20's and graduated college in 2010. Two months later I started my first job in my field with an ad agency in my hometown. Cost of living here is relatively low, and the pay was good. I didn't plan on moving back here, but it was too good of an opportunity to pass up. I started at a salary of 31k, and have had two 5k raises since then, the second coming just a few weeks ago and I haven't seen a paycheck with that new salary yet. I'll be getting it tomorrow. So for the past 2.5 years, I have been making 36k annually. After insurance, 401k, taxes, etc. this amounted to $1,021 per paycheck - paid twice per month. 

I've been looking for other job opportunities for the past two years. All out of town. I just want to move because, like I stated previously, I never really wanted to end up back here. I went from living in a city of over 500,000 people to going back down to just 100,000. I miss the culture, excitement and life of a more populated location. 

I have a job interview tomorrow in a city I really enjoy a few hours away. It's my dream job. However... They said they'd only be willing to pay 30k for the position after I gave them a range of 38k-42k based on my current pay. They still want me to come interview. I'm hoping to talk them up to at least doing 35k for a salary. Cost of living in this city is more than where I am now. I'd also be working more hours, but it's mainly work-from-home. So I really can't afford a pay of any less than that.

I'm just trying to figure out if I could afford this move or if I'd be stupid to do it. Something to note is that my SO would be moving with me. He's versatile and can land any job need be, but we'd be splitting things 50/50.

Current Monthly Net Pay [$36k salary]: $2,042 

Current Monthly Expenses:

* Private Student Loan: $330
* My share of Rent: $216
* Utilities: $60
* Cell Phone: $100
* Internet: $35
* Federal Student Loan: $185
* HSA: $35
* Car Insurance: $65
* Car/Personal Loan: $445
* Netflix/Spotify: $25

**TOTAL: $1500 (Rounded up from $1496)**

That left me about $500 to spend on gas, food and any other entertainment/unforseen expenses during the month as well as trying to put some money into savings. 

If my SO and I make this move we'd try to find an apartment with utilities included. I've seen some in the area for about $700. So my rent would jump to $350, but I'd also be losing my utilities bill. I can cancel Netflix and Spotify. I'm going next weekend to get on a cheaper cellphone plan. I won't be driving nearly as much so I won't need as much extra money for gas. If I can get them to pay 35k annual salary, my budget would be pretty similar. 

Would I be foolish to make this transition? Or is it worth it for the happiness of a new environment an a job I'm ungodly passionate about?",finance,1402598010

Option B. Sell car, pay off credit card, use remaining to put down payment on a slightly better car in the $10k range, and finance the rest at about a 4% interest rate. The upside of this is I have a more reliable car for my job and family.

Hey PF!

Recent grad here and I'm pretty worried about the state of my finances and the impending doom that comes with repayment.

I've been lurking here for a while. I have set up a Mint account to help keep a close watch on my finances and its helped me to pinpoint the unnecessary spending I was doing with regards to nights out.

After cutting that stuff out and realizing the errors of my ways, I decided to check in on my on student loan amounts to prep for those. My first payments on my sub and unsub stafford loans (the 3.4% and 6.8% loans) do not have their first payment due until September.

Looking at my student loans today kinda freaked me out, a lot. 


On the upside, I do have a stable income. My car isn't giving me any trouble (knock on wood.) No rent or utilities need to be paid, thank you mom n pops! I do have an evaluation coming next month that should see my pay rate increase by a VERY small amount (net +$80/month) Probably a placebo effect but I'll take it none the less.

If my two loans that I am making payments on now at 8.9% interest rate are running around 250, will I even be able to pay for my sub and un-subsidized loans?I hope to get my car paid off before then to help as well as I see that's another 200 I can throw at my loans. Am I going to be in trouble this fall PF?

-Pension plan through work.  Contribute 4%, employer puts 10%.  In 8 more years, this changes to a different plan where i cant contribute.  They keep putting 4%, and i also start accumulating in a new pension under a formula: Years of Service x 1.75% x 3 best years
-No consumer debt. Pay CCs in full every month
-Bought a house in Feb
-Owe 18,800 back to my RRSP over 15 years for first time home buyer plan
-Previously saved $4000 a month for around 3 years up till I bought my house.  Some of that (90k) was in an investment that pooped, currently valued around 20k.  The rest I used towards down payment, closing costs, and about 12k for furniture and outfitting the home. 
-I did blow some money in my early and mid 20s.  It was fun, i dont regret it.  But they probably werent the best decisions. Haha. Vegas! Ugh.
-Home is a 2 bedroom/2 bath high rise condo in downtown Calgary. Suits my lifestyle being gone a lot. Built in 2009.  Payed $517,500. Feb 1, 2014.    I live alone, and I am not home half the month due to flying away for work a week on, a week off type schedule.  I am not interested in renting as I value my freedom to do whatever the hell I want when I am home. Bought 2bed as resale is stronger on 2 bed.2bath condos.
-Big traveller.  I collect Aeroplan points with Air Canada and all my credit cards, banking, etc.  Most major flights are payed for with points.  Stay in hostels, etc.  1 week on 1 week off lets me get away a lot, plus vacation time
-Overtime pay is $800 take home per day worked.  I can do anywhere from 0-8 a month on average.  In the future I plan to aim for around 3 a month.

**Accounts**
$10,000 - High Interest Savings Account (Emergency Fund)
$3000 - Checking day to day balance
$1000 - US Dollar Account
$~10,000 - TFSA (Maxed, took a hit)
$~10,000 - Non Reg. Investment Account (Took a hit) My long term big major purchase account.  Second home, etc.
$2000 - RRSP (Just started my auto withdrawls back up after settling into a new home and a few vacations year to date)
$43,000 - Company Pension after 2 years (35k book, up around 21% in 2 years).
$8000 - Old company pension.  Can move out in Jan 2015 where I see fit.
$18,800 - Credit Card.  $120 yearly fee.  0 balance.
$5000 - Credit Card.  Oldest account.  0 fee. 0 balance.
$10,000 - Credit card.  $120 yearly fee, waived.  Cancelling at end of period. Used for a crazy aeroplan bonus. 0 balance
$18,000 - Line of Credit at Prime+3.25 (6.25%).  0 Balance.

**Income**
My take home after tax every month is **$8872** (after CPP and EI payed off which is usually done by March. I wont both with these numbers).  Im in max tax bracket, of 39%.

**Expenses**
$1350 x 2 - Mortgage Payment (Accel. Bi Weekly).  These are actually only $1122 but i choose to increase by the maximum of 20%.
$300 - Property Tax
$400 - Condo Fees (Heating, Gas, Water, Sewage)
$2000 - Savings.  Auto deductions after every payday. Currently funding RRSP.
$800 - Company Stock Plan.  Maxed out in November at this amount.  15% or better guaranteed return. (Buy shares at 15% off Jan 1 or Dec 31 share price, whichever is lowest.  Share up from $25.90 to $29.45 this year so far.)
$630 - Leased Vehicle. Yes I lease a BMW.  I love it, its worth it to me, and fits my lifestyle... my one toy!
$442 - Misc Bills (Cell Phone, Internet, Electric Bill, Insurance)
$400 - I currently have my company deduct an extra $200 a paycheck extra towards taxes.

This leaves me with approx $1200 to live off per month.  Grocery bills are low, i buy a few pieces of clothing every month, eat out a few times, etc etc.  1200 is more than enough.  This also pays for trips, tickets to shows, etc etc.  If im short, I dip into overtime. No big deal.

**Overtime**
Target of 3 shifts a month to maintain a healthy personal life:
$800 per day.  Plan is to pay myself first, flights, tickets, activities. I can also bank these days for additional vacation time.  The value of the OT is then regular time. I can bank 4 before i have to use them to bank 4 more.  May bank 4-8 in the next year.  Banking 8 this year.  
If I take the cash, and do not spend  it on myself (not hard, I am not a big spender believe it or not) I plan to contribute this extra money towards my non registered account and invest.  This account is for things like a vehicle PURCHASE (when my awful lease expires ;) ;) ), or a second home.  

**Personal Goals, Rules, and Plans**
-I would like to buy a second home within 5 years.  Probably a house.  Would like the down payment of 20%.  Would keep current condo to rent (Est. $3000 a month rent).
-Contribute extra overtime to Non.Reg. Investment Account.  $800-3000 a month, depending on availability.
-Directing all savings to RRSP.  My limit is 7k this year, plus 10k carried from years before.  Will max this out by tax time.  Next year, continue deposits into RRSP. Predicting 8k contribution room (based on Pension Adjustment), then keep contributing until my $18,800 first time home buyers plan is payed back.
-TFSA maxed upon tax refund
-Increase savings by the % of my yearly raise every year
-Yearly company performance bonus March 1 ($3-10k clear) to be used towards TFSA, then treat myself to something nice (Pay myself), then Non. Reg savings. 


**Unsure About**
-Should I keep increasing my mortgage payment by 20% every year (as allowed), or use this money elsewhere. Or just increase by my yearly raise %.
-I found my company pays my taxes to the government pretty accurately.  Last year, before adding my RRSP contributions to my tax form, my refund was $4700.. and i had put an additional $4800 against during the year.  Thinking of downing my extra tax to $50 a check.  Should I put this extra $300 straight into my savings every month?
-My emergency fund. Could I invest this 10k into something safe in my Non Reg account and make a better return, or leave in the savings account?  Could my Line of Credit with a decent interest rate be used as my emergency fund?

personalfinance,ETF investing help (xpost /r/ausfinance),"Hi there,
Probably need some advice if following boglehead style investing is a good idea for Australians.

**My financial status:**
Age: 26

Income: 55-60/annum

Able to save: $2000-2500/month

Current savings: $30k/cash. Sitting in a Ubank savings account

Super: $10k (High growth managed funds shares allocation, will rebalance for more cash bonds as I get older)

Plans to buy a house: I'm happy renting, no plans to save for a house and I want to remain mobile.

Unsecured debt: None, car paid off etc

**What I am already doing:**

I am currently sacrificing my income to save up on taxes, sacrificing as much as it is tax feasible, I wont be able to max my contributions but will not push my effective tax rate below 15% including medicare levy.

**What I want to do:**

I want to invest $15k in mostly US-based ETFs as I am attracted by their low management fees compared to AUS etfs. I have no need to touch this money in the near forseeable future, this is for retirement. I'll probably be contributing every 4 months to reduce brokerage fees and will rebalance every time I contribute. I am also with bell direct. I will slowly increase my bond allocations as I get older.

65% VTS- Vanguard US Total Market Shares ETF (Expense: 0.06%)

30% VEU - Vanguard ALl world ex-US Shares ETF (Expense: 0.15%)

5% IAF - iShares UBS Composite Bond ETF (Expense: 0.24%)

**Questions:**

1. Are there any US based taxed implications I should be worried about?

2. Is buying bonds still generally a good idea since we have decent interest rates in Australia? (getting 4.3% at Ubank atm). I'm going to say yes? This is generally favorable in the US as they get fuck all from the banks.

3. Would it bite me in the ass to be US stock heavy? Kinda leaning on Warren Buffets advice to never bet against the US.

4. Anything you would change otherwise? Or any advice in general how to plan for retirement. Allocations? Any other recommended index funds I should know about?",finance,1402626825

personalfinance,Benefit to Personal Line of Credit While Consolidating Debt?,"So, I'm not sure this is a great option for my situation, but I'm curious to see what PF thinks.

I'm working on consolidating and eliminating my credit card debt. I'm open to options and currently have two credit cards that are 0% interest until February as a way to spread some debt and my credit union just approved me for a personal line of credit for $2,500 at 13.90%.

My thought is this. While I'm carrying a LOT of CC debt across my five credit cards (really focusing on cutting back on the splurge spending and random purchases), only two of them have interest rates above what the line of credit offers (16.9% and 15%).

Are there any other benefits to moving some debt to this line of credit? Does it appear more ""favorably"" on my credit report than a credit card? Or is it still considered to be revolving credit?

If I did move debt over, it would be off of my 16.9% card and would leave a remaining balance of about $1300 left on that card to pay off.

Just not sure if it's worth it and if I should just keep working towards paying off my highest interest card first.

**EDIT:** I appreciate the feedback, but I think I need to clarify. I know personal changes need to be made and I have started taken steps to do just that and only carry limited cash and my debit card with me to prevent additional debt to the CCs. I have always made extra payments, never been late. It's just continual spending that makes it so I never see a dent in anything. Can proudly say this is changing, thank goodness.

My real question is two part. Does a personal line of credit still show up as revolving credit on my credit score, or does it show up more ""favorably"" like an installment loan? And in turn would it look better if I moved $2500 from my highest interested CC, paid that card off to $0 balance and then started working on my next highest card, etc.

If that is not the case, then I don't see the ~$75 savings being a big enough deal to make the move. The one upside to the PLC is that there isn't a fee to transfer balances on to it. It would just be an easier decision if the APR wasn't so similar to my CCs.",finance,1402633677

Sorry... a little side tracked perhaps..... But the previous fed chairman Alan Greenspan already admitted he pushed interest rates too low in the early 2000's which may have contributed to the debt crisis in ~2008 from which we still suffer the consequences. This could end up getting technical, but people speculate that the reason we are still suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 is because of the fed. I mean if we saw the same amount of anger toward the fed, rather than ghash.io we might be able to get out this faster.

I'm currently finishing my degree in the Netherlands and starting a full-time job immediately after I've graduated in 2 months.

I have a study debt of approximately €33k with an interest rate of 0.8%. For the first two years I won't have to pay anything back (but interest will continue to accumulate) and after those 2 years I will have to pay back the loan+interest in 15 years, so approximately €200/month.

As soon as I start working I will have around €600/month extra after all expenses. My initial thought was to spend all this extra money on paying back my student loan as fast as possible but I'm not entirely sure about this.

Are there any better options? Should I be depositing this money into a savings account (although interest on a normal savings account is &lt; 1%)? Maybe investing, although I have absolutely no knowledge about this?

She has a lot of credit card debt ($4,000) that I just realized she has been making min payments on with 20%+ interest rates!  OMG!!!  So I thought I would be savvy and did some research.  I suggested we get her a Chase Slate Card with no Balance Transfer fees, and transfer everything over to that one card since it has 0% APR for 15 months which we could easily pay off with a budget.  Well, she got approved for the card, but they only gave her a $2,000 credit limit, and only transferred the balance of one of her 3 credit cards that we inputed.  We requested a limit increase, and Chase sent a letter saying she had too much outstanding debt and her credit score was not good enough.  She had a hospital bill go to collections a while back and I believe she still owes $250 on it, which I assume put a big slash in her credit score.  Is there anything she can do or say to convince Chase to transfer the rest of the balances?

personalfinance,The 3 C's of Lending: Understanding the Loan Decision Process,"Frequently on Reddit people think only of credit when considering loans.  Credit is very important and often predominantly determines the rate you get but it's not the be all end all.  The Three C's of Lending can help paint a clear picture of what factors into a lender's decision.  They are:

* Character
* Capacity
* Collateral

**Character** Why do you trust one friend to housesit but not the other?  This is an issue of character.  A loan officer just meeting you does not know your character.  

The best tool we have to determine your character is your **credit**.  What's the best predictor of future actions?  Past actions.  Your credit report tells us, imperfectly, how you've done paying people back in the past.

**Capacity**  Some people have a 800 credit score but won't be approved for a loan.  Likely because it has been determined they can't afford it, they don't have the capacity.  That means that their income minus their expenses does not leave enough money for this new prospective loan payment.

**Collateral**  Some loans have collateral, some don't.  Collateral is more security for the lender and therefore correspond generally with lower interest rates.  A house is better collateral than a car, therefore homeloan rates are lower.  Credit cards have no collateral therefore their rates are relatively high.  

When discussing collateral the important concept of **loan to value ratio** is introduced.  A lender likely will not loan $15,000 for a car that is valued at $10,000- a loan to value ratio of 150%.  That is because they are not secure in their collateral.  Homes are appraised for this reason as well.

All of these factors play into the lending decision to varying degrees.  I've found the Three C's of Lending a valuable tool for conveying these ideas.",finance,1402682222

Now for the longer version: a little over a year ago, my father passed away.  While he had a heart condition for as long as I can remember, it was still somewhat unexpected.  I had lunch with him the day before he died, and he was doing just fine, and then the next day he was gone.  We were close and this was a huge blow to me.  I was in shock for a while afterwards; it took a while for me to process what had happened.  When the dust finally settled, I began tending to his affairs and, when all was said and done, between the life insurance policies and his personal savings and investment accounts, I was left with about $750,000.  I would trade it all to have him back.  I know everyone says this, but it is totally true.  Unfortunately, that is not an option, so...

A little more about me.  I'm a 29 year old single Software Engineer.  Prior to all this, I was doing pretty good financially: I pull in a very good salary and I purchased a house at 26 with a 20% down payment.  This is the only debt I have at the moment, and I owe about 300k with an interest rate of 3.375% fixed (with ~27 years go go).  Between my company and personal contributions, I put 15% of my salary into a 401k.  I also own my own side business, an LLC that I set up for my own development efforts.  I have a few apps in various mobile app stores, and I do some consulting.

As far as the inherited money, it can be split into two groups: life insurance payouts and inherited funds.  The life insurance payouts total around $500k and I've split them amongst 5 mutual funds ranging from relatively conservative to some more moderate-risk.  Over the last year they have performed fairly well (about 10% growth overall).  The inherited funds, worth around $250k, were already in an actively managed investment account.  My dad had a relationship with a financial adviser / broker who was managing them. So far, he has been incredibly helpful to me throughout this process, so I guess you could say I inherited him as well.  At any rate, the funds in this account are doing even better at about 15% growth in the last year.

My goals are... well, that's hard to say.  For now, I'm fairly happy with my career and the life I've built before this all happened, which is why it hasn't been too hard to avoid the temptation to quit my job and travel around the world, or something crazy like that.  That isn't to say I don't want to enjoy the money; that would be exactly what my Dad would want me to do with it.  But ultimately I don't have a huge desire to change my lifestyle right now.  At the same time, I'm NOT AT ALL interested in locking the funds away by stashing most or all of it in some retirement account or something where I can't touch it for years.  I'd like to have it available if and when I need it, but while it is just sitting there, I'd prefer to have it working for me as much as possible.

So if you were me, what would you do?

Thanks in advance for your replies.",finance,1402683595

investing,"There is no ""market of stocks."" Only a Stock Market, which is composed of 1 stock: Wall St.","I've been studying the stock market for years. Something that intrigues me to this day is the congruence at which the entire market moves in stride. (When that happens, [the whole market simultaneously goes red, for example](http://i.imgur.com/W1b9a7K.png)). I'm not conspiratorial and think it's all rigged, nor will I blame high-frequency trading, the FED, or any one culprit. Like most complex phenomena, it's likely to be multi-faceted. 

See, I used to have the assumption that *individual companies traded on their own merits* (**Crazy** notion, right?!). Rather, I gradually learned that they are more often pushed and pulled by the action of the larger indexes or corresponding ETF's. The beta coefficient of a stock supposedly measures this volatility in relation to ""the market"" as a whole. But I've found it's a poor indicator. And yes, I'm aware of recent divergences between indices and equities, but this doesn't change the fact that for much of the time, stocks move with each other.

I misplaced the chart I made recently to elucidate this, but I opened 10-15 seemingly unrelated biotech stocks and layered them atop each other, and then included the IBB (biotech ETF). The price swings all lined up, and mirrored each other -- with a few aberrant exceptions (likely event or catalyst driven). That's right; whether you're selling fish oil, cancer medications, dandruff shampoo, or prosthetics, your company's valuation moves in sync with everyone else's. 

The rationality for this doesn't make any sense, but people have gotten so complacent they just accept it. When I'm trading and conversing online, it's typical to hear ""the market is ripping today,"" or ""the market is a bloodbath today."" Why, in the name of all things holy, would thousands of unrelated equities (comprised, *SUPPOSEDLY*, of unique individual balance sheets and corporate strategies) trade together? Sure the market is an interdependent entity, but there is no reason for most ALL of the stocks to be either up or down on one day unless it is being manipulated to do so. 

The human social behavior that drives economics isn't that static. It's hard to get everyone on the same page. Crowd/herd behavior is definitely a thing, but this is not the case. It often surprises everyone. This is especially irrational in the absence of any fundamental change; e.g. no dramatic events (good or bad) in the news, no special FED buying program that day, no Yellen or Obama speeches, etc.  And if chaos is inherent in the system, then why is it so damn predictable that the market, whether going up or down, will carry unrelated equities with it?

personalfinance,I have an intra-family mortgage- should I stick with it or get a real mortgage in the short-long term?,"Our situation- My husband and I bought the house 2 years ago. It belonged to his mother and her husband and we bought it because they were moving out of state. My in-laws are tax accountants so they did the paperwork and set up an intra-family loan so every month we make our mortgage payments to my in-laws. This was/is ideal because my hubbs and I did not look so great financially on paper. My credit is decent (low 700s), his was not so great (low 600s). We both have a lot of debt and we are managing that just fine but on paper our employment/income stream was not stable. I had just started grad school and I did not work at all for the first 9 months. My husband routinely changed jobs every couple years and he was preparing to have a series of surgeries (it's complicated but he's all better now). Anyway, getting married, going back to grad school, buying a house- all this stuff happened right around the same time so it was a no-brainer for us to go with the intra-family loan because we probably would not have qualified for a good rate and we did not have any time, knowledge, or experience to do the research.

Here's the sticky part and sorry if I am not using the correct terms- My hubbs had a large sum of money in a trust that was his late father's estate, and their mother was the executor of the trust (divorced over 30 years). It took many years to sell off everything and the total value of the trust was split 50/50 with another sibling. We only kept $10k for home improvement stuff but the rest of it was all put towards the down payment ~$350,000 down for a $550,000 house so we have a very low monthly mortgage payment (~$900). It would have been nice to keep more of the $350k to jump-start our savings and $10k was not enough for all the remodeling, but there may have been a verbal agreement between my hubbs and my in-laws to give them all of that money since they were carrying our loan. In any case, that was all his money and so I didn't really feel like I had a say in the situation. There were other issues too like how they valued the home at $550k because the house was really more of a fixer-upper but it's got good bones, it's in a nice, safe neighborhood, and we didn't want to turn it into a personal, money-grabbing fight with family so we just went with it (but that's a whole other discussion). 

TL; DR- Our intra-family loan is for ~$200,000 for 30 years at 4% with a monthly payment of under $1,000/month. 

First question- Is this a good deal? Since it wasn't my money and we didn't get to negotiate w/ his mother and her husband (they pretty much just gave us the terms and we agreed) I was always slightly paranoid that they took advantage of us. 

Second question- Should my hubbs and I consider getting a ""real"" mortgage later on to build our credit? Will it help our credit considerably compared to just being diligent with on-time payments to our other debts, etc? I am just not sure if it will be worth the refi cost especially if we don't get the same 4% rate we've been enjoying. Also, I worry that with a ""real"" mortgage if we are late or short one month we'll get our asses foreclosed on. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings if we close/pay out the intrafamily loan but I don't really want to be financially tied to my in-laws. I am thinking in 5 years to refinance to a 15 year loan, keep the mortgage manageable ($1,500/mo) but I have no idea what interest rate we'll get. 

Third question- Is it really important for us to have more joint accounts or is it only if we plan on purchasing more real estate in the future (income properties etc)? We had a joint auto-loan that has been paid off. We have another joint loan ($10k) that he got to help pay his medical bills. We might have one joint credit card but he's responsible for it. Pretty much everything else is separate- bank accounts, student loans, credit cards, etc.

economy,Economics Unmasked,"Is it conceivable that flawed economic theory could ultimately be the invisible force behind America's economic decline? Is it also conceivable that the GOP is completely oblivious to its own party's and Constitution's economic heritage? Geldstone, conservative engineer and author of Lincoln's Revenge, suggests the answer is yes.  To begin to understand why this might be possible, let's first frame the discussion in a very puzzling historical perspective. Consider Daniel Webster who said the main reason we have our Constitution is to stop free trade. In keeping with this nation-building tradition, Lincoln and GOP were protectionists until 1960. Karl Marx interestingly echoed this spirit when he suggested that free trade would accelerate capitalism's destruction. Fast forward a hundred and fifty years and recognize that China adopts Lincoln's logic and we Marx.

Given this picture, it is not difficult to imagine that these men would have predicted a boom for China and a bust for America. Yet, a modern economist would very likely argue that free trade, not protectionism is the road to prosperity. To make sense of this contradiction, Geldstone begins with a very daring proposition: there has never been a sound theory of economics. The key intellectual error of all schools of economics argues Geldstone is the incomplete economic definition of money: 1) medium of exchange, 2) store of value, and 3) unit of account. Note this definition completely ignores money's link to wages so that labor content maybe tracked in industrial goods in order to measure productivity gains.  Tracking productivity gains is absolutely critical to worker mobility from one sector to another as short term unemployment results from such gains.  The cost savings are passed on to the consumer in a price reduction, which in turn is spent in a new sector providing new employment opportunities.   More importantly, Geldstone, argues a correct definition of money is not only needed for a labor theory of value, but that it is ultimately a domestic phenomenon. 

Three critical components give money its domestic basis and its rigidity.  The first aspect results from the establishment of a national minimum wage.  Thus as James Steuart writing prior to Adam Smith in the 1700s understood, money is nothing more than an ""arbitrary scale"" which arises out of an infinite and worthless paper money  supply or credit system.   Thus a minimum wage definition provides the point of gravitation from which a national wage structure is established via supply and demand for skill sets.  The second component is wage negotiation process itself.  As Keynes observed it is a relative comparison process (an American steelworker compares his wage to another American steelworker, not a foreign steel worker).  A necessarily rigid wage system is established so that labor content of industrial goods can be rationally tracked for measuring productivity gains.   The properly handling of productivity gains, and the short term resulting unemployment, requires a common language component, a critical theoretical oversight which in my view will prove to be the Euro's undoing.  In other words, a French worker will be hard pressed to move should the superior competitor (greatest industrial productivity) happen to be in Germany for example. 

In terms of economic theory this means the 200 year old Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) is flawed, something the long forgotten James Steuart, as noted above, understood.   He recognized England's industrial might rested on an advanced system of credit, not gold.  The anti-QTM sentiment also had brief a revival with Thomas Tooke, but would be eventually cast aside by a mainstream interpretations of economic thought.  If QTM is flawed, so then is modern micro, macro, and international economics (free trade theory).  

QTM itself was packaged in two different forms: 1) Fisher's equation of exchange ( a model without savings), and 2) the Cambridge form (money's store of value is emphasized). In spite of various tug-of-wars over money theory, the fundamental flaw remains: the erroneous causality leading from the quantity of money to price level as these two models suggest.  The end product which has risen out of generations of QTM-based chalkboard scribbling is a modern economic model which is built on stone-age barter, with money as an afterthought (general equilibrium/Walras model). In this astonishingly bizarre interpretation of reality, an invisible auctioneer is introduced to negotiate prices and wages in the blink of an eye across a nation (supply and demand in the form of simultaneous equations). In short, modern economic theory amounts to an auction house model which establishes relative barter prices (e.g.. two eggs for one chicken). Money, in any form you can imagine, is then sprinkled on top in order to establish a price level. The more money (i.e. eggs) in an economy the higher the price level. The roots of this mind set go back to the 1700s where we find David Hume's gold-like-the wind speculations. From such an intellectual fantasy of money mechanics, germinated the first forms of free trade theory courtesy of David Ricardo.

The first critical error in such a barter-based approach is its assumption that the quantity of goods on the market are given before relative barter prices are established. In other words, this is a near equivalent of manna falling from heaven. Each agent is ""endowed"" with a given quantity of goods against which he will negotiate a relative exchange price for another good. This is the complete reversal of reality in which the cost of production of a good ultimately drives the level of demand, and in turn drives the final sector size (quantity of goods on the market). In other words, in the real world price comes before quantity, not quantity before price.  The price of the wage in turn is established by the foundation of a minimum domestic wage (by decree). 

In addition, the negotiation of barter prices in Walras' model suffers from a much more subtle problem. Markets clear (all goods are exchanged and no one is unemployed) by instant and infinitely flexible price and wage adjustments in such model. This again is the complete reversal of reality where domestic wage rigidity is required to force short term unemployment due to productivity gains. In other words, in models built on barter productivity gains can not be properly tracked since prices magically adjust to prevent unemployment. The rigidity serves a critical secondary purposes: Inferior domestic competitors cannot reduce wages under the pressure of a superior competitor to gain an artificial advantage.  In other words, rigid wages serve to identify the superior competitor with the lost cost of production in a domestic economy.

To fully appreciate this mind set, one only needs to consider Menger, from the Austrian school (i.e. the intellectual home of many modern libertarians), who claimed it makes no difference for the price of diamond if you find it by luck or have to dig it out of the earth. Tell that to mine operator who just bought a million dollar earth moving machine. One of Menger's followers, Boehm-Bawerk takes this to heart with his horse auction example, where buyers outnumber sellers. Some buyers obviously are forced out of the process and the price of a horse converges to a happy-price which clears the market in this Austrian world of barter economics. Unfortunately, this is almost the same error of the classical school which mistakenly believes price theory is microeconomics, instead of macroeconomics. To see the mistake in Boehm-Bawerk's logic, one needs to understand the implication of the excessive number of buyers. These buyers have chosen not to spend their money in other industry sectors, resulting ultimately in unemployment. These unemployed can now migrate to the horse sector to breed more horses to meet demand at the cost-of-production, and not at auction-house prices. Even more troubling in this horse model is the fact that the final horse prices ultimately sets (imputes) the wages of the horse breeders. Tell that to the factory accountant when he prices out the final cost of an assemble automobile consisting of 14,000 parts.

This sort of intellectual confusion is also reflected in the Austrian School's love for a gold standard.  Ask your self the following question.  Did China's rise rest on gold or on the power of industrial credit for a growing industrial base?   Consider the possibly that in country A it takes 10 hours to extract 1 oz of gold, while in country B a 100 hours.  Thus gold was nothing more than an arbitrary domestic scale. The minimum wage definition has effectively replace the role that gold played.  Gold did not prevent free trade economic chaos under the Articles of Confederation.  

The intellectual skirmishes over QTM have spawned various schools of economics (e.g. Keynesianism, Monetarism), with painfully complex and irrelevant debates over the money supply, money demand, savings, investment, and interest rates. Irrelevant, because as any observer of China can see, its prosperity is not linked to any of these variables, but the simple principle of building and protecting an industrial base. 

Though the early schools of economics were built on a labor theory of value (not barter pricing), they were not immune from errors regarding money.  To make the case, Geldstone argues the classical school's founders Smith (father of free markets) and Ricardo (father of free trade) failed to recognize free trade as the source of England's subsistence wages upon which a flawed labor theory of price was constructed.  The intellectual irony that results is nicely illustrated by Smith the father of free markets and capitalism, and the father of anti-capitalism Marx who both built their theories on the very same flawed wage/money model. American protectionists of the 1700 and 1800s were much subtler in their thinking than Smith and recognized that a critical distinction had to be made between free domestic markets and free international mkts. Why? Gut instinct and the school of hard knocks. 

Keynesians, with only one foot still in the neoclassical world, end up praying that stimulus will save the business community. Divide $6 trillion in fed, state, and local annual spending by 115 million full time workers and you get about $52K per worker of ""stimulus"". Not enough? Well, perhaps the Keynesian multipiler as it miraculously goes to infinity if you don't save will do the trick. Even more troubling, from an engineer's perspective, is Keynes' new interpretation of the classical school's belief of a relationship between investment and saving. As Geldstone argues, investment as a percentage of GDP, is simply due to the state of technology. It is not as Keynes suggests a function of interest rates and the marginal efficiency of capital. In addition, investment is not the source of instability in an economy as Keynes argue, it is consumption (following wealth destruction). Nor can investment lead an economy out of recession, because business owner investment follows the behavior of the consumer. And finally, if all this was not enough to cause confusion, Keynes failed to understand the implications of investment patterns which follow (trail) 115 million unique consumption patterns. Where do you suggest we invest in such an economic kaleidoscope and how do you distinguish between a business that is slowing down because it is an inferior competitor verses one whose business is slowing down due to a recession? Which of the two should invest? The answer: neither.

Post Keynesians though having made some progress  grasping endogenous money (demand drives the level of credit--a form of anti-QTM) and understanding profit as a mark up on costs of production, seem unable to let go of the notion of capitalism as inherently unstable (no guarantee of full employment).  Geldstone's position turns this position on its head by arguing that is it precisely domestic money's critical role in a closed economy which gives protectionist capitalism's its stability (speculative busts in real estate aside--this is a problem with human nature, not industrial economy).  

So if economics is a science, which science are we talking about? The Marxists, the New Keynesians, the Post-Keynesian, the neo-Keynesians, the Austrians, the neoclassicals, the Monetarists, the New Classical, The Real Business, the classical school, ...well you get the idea. A bit like having 10 different laws of gravity. Could it be Geldstone just might be onto something here?

What then does engineer Geldstone offer as the new law of economic ""physics""? The answer: A theory which provides the missing theoretical basis to protectionism (Lincolnomics).  A new model of money means simply that protectionism is the only sound theory of economics.  Geldstone's proposition is thus the complete reversal and rejection of QTM, and 200 years of economic thought.  The subtle implication of Geldstone's argument is the belief that a closed nation will drive an economy to full employment in the long run with minimum labor content per industrial good (i.e. its the highest standard of living a nation can achieve given the ingenuity and work ethic of its people). As a result, those who produce the wealth will fully consume the wealth of a nation. The notion of exporting a surplus does not exist in the model (sectors would simply adjust in size instead). Nor is this an attempt to say nation ""A"" will have a higher standard of living than nation ""B"" due to the wealth measuring problem. Instead, the model argues a closed economy is the best you can do, because free trade ultimately results in long term unemployment (for the inferior cost competitor), or results in wealth exportation (as the superior nation competitor--e.g. subsistence wages of 1700/1800s Britian).  

Super powers grow rich by protecting their industries. Superpowers by definition are industrial power houses. In other words, factories ARE the economy because their long-run productivity gains free up labor for new sector growth. All sectors ultimately depend on the industrial base for their existence (otherwise we'd still be an agricultural society).  Destroying the blue collar worker will ultimately destroy the rich because the health of the finance system ultimately relies on wealth production, not vice versa. 

Unless we learn the very hard lessons of economic chaos our founding father's had to learn under The Articles of Confederation due to low cost imports from Britain, I suspect more and more businesses will find it very difficult to succeed. Niche markets will remain, but as a whole the outlook will be one of increasing economic dysfunction.  

If the Chinese understand the economic wisdom of our founding fathers, maybe it is time we do to.",finance,1402701529

The deal is: you get 100% financing of the home with $0 down payment required, an interest rate in the 2.5-3.5% range depending on your credit, and no PMI.  As I've literally had no time to save money (being on loans all through medical school) I don't really have any money to put towards the mortgage as a down payment.  I'm going to be in the same city for at least seven years, so I'd hate to rent that entire time. Owning a home seems like a great thing to do instead, and if the property increases in value, you've essentially made money out of nothing. To me, it seems like a good deal, but others have said that by not having any personal equity in the home it makes it a bad deal should the property decrease in value.  Wouldn't that just mean that you stand to lose LESS money if your home goes down in value from what you purchased it for (ie, you don't lose what you didn't put in it).

Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks",finance,1402706975

personalfinance,"Under 21, Attempting to repair credit enough for home equity loan eligibility.","Arkansas

My mother passed away May of last year from cancer, without a will, and after 6 months in an estate account under the control of my uncle, the house, her car, and the rest of her money, were inherited equally between me and my sister. My sister has since gone broke, and hasn't put any time, effort, or money into helping to repair this house, and is in and out of jail regularly. Because of this, I can't afford to repair this house and make it a livable home, without additional assistance.

I tried applying for a home equity loan at my bank, but I failed the credit check, by roughly 100 points. My uncle advised me to get a credit card from the local federal credit union, and repair my credit that way. However, you have to be the age of 21 or older to apply for one.

I'm not very educated in how credit works, or if there's even a method to build or repair my credit score aside from using a credit card. I'm 20 years old, and I have another 7 months before I turn 21. I'm forced to live with a friend, which between the living expenses, and the upkeep/repair of an old empty house is something I can't afford until then. Time is a huge factor, because I'm trying to move into the house in order to save money, with the house being fully paid for. I've got about $2,000 to my name, and I work a minimum wage job, and this house still requires all appliances, painting, structural work, landscaping, and the list goes on.

I'm not going to say that trying to sell the house is not an option, however, with my sister being incarcerated half the time and having 50% interest in the house (tenants in common), and that I have already put $15,000 into this house, and with it having huge sentimental value to me, this would be the last thing I want to have to consider. If it's of any importance, my credit score via credit karma is 526.

Sorry for the long read, any advice would be extremely helpful.

EDIT: I don't know anyone with good enough credit to be able to co-sign on either the loan, or a credit card, my father is also deceased, and the only other relative in town, excluding my sister, is my grandfather. Who, I'm not very confident at all will agree to co-sign on.",finance,1402711440
personalfinance,24 year old with $50K attending school this fall: Save and invest or save and pay tuition/loans.,"Hello Personal Finance,
 I've always been interested in finance and this subreddit seems perfect for learning new information. 
My background of finance comes from these books: 
The New CoffeeHouse Investor,
The Bogleheads Guide to Investing,
Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How To Correct Them, 
Personal Finance for Dummies

My problem: 
I start medical school in the fall, cost for attending is $25,000 a year for tuition and the school estimates living expenses to be $21,039.00 (room, insurance, transportation) So that would be a 200,000 dollar loan.
UnSubsidized loans for medical school are 5.41% fixed interest rate up to 40,000. 
The remaining is through federal graduate PLUS loans at 6.41% with a 4.28% origination fee
Interests accrues in both of these loans even while I'm in school. 

I have a small roth ira (only 10k) that I started through Vanguard's VTSMX total stock index fund BUT I stopped contributing to it because I felt that saving up and paying for loans was a smarter choice. Paying off a guaranteed 5% versus the risk of losing money in a long term investment.

The startup company I work at also got bought out giving me a nice lump of $50,000. 

- Should this money be used to pay tuition (I can write it off on my taxes as education?)

- Should I invest in CDs or Bonds with this extra money or save it to pay off loans.

- Will I need to adjust my withholdings because of this extra cash? (Do I need to worry about being in another tax bracket?)


More about me.

- I payed off my undergrad loans. 

- No credit card debt

- I do not plan on buying a house while in school.

- I will NOT be working while I'm in medical school so there is no opportunity to add to my retirement fund.

- My startup did not offer a 401k matching retirement fund that I could have used. :( 

- Yes I do plan on quitting and going HAM (traveling a bit) before school starts and my life goes to shit.


Any advice? Thanks",finance,1402715026

personalfinance,Putting a million dollars down on a condo. Nuts?,"Realize this could just be seen as bragging, so apologies, but really interested in honest feedback as this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can ask your friends.

I'm in my early thirties and the beneficiary of a trust with a balance of $2m. I have a good salary and have been renting for a while below my means and not touching the trust money. I also have personal savings separate from the trust of $150k and 401k balance of $75k. The stated purpose of the trust is for wealth building and providing for major expenses such as housing and education. The trust is invested with a fairly moderate allocation (50-60% equities).

I live in a very high COL area with a competitive real estate market and have been wanting to upgrade my living arrangement for a while, but not wanting to shell out $4000+ per month in rent when I could get an even better place with the same monthly payment (locked in), and the long term potential upside of appreciation and/or rental income if I want to move later, as long as I liquidate a significant portion of trust assets for the down payment.

Indeed, that's what I've done (without asking reddit first, oops). I'm in contract to buy a $1.4m condo with $1m down and a 400k loan, to balance the opportunity of historically low interest rates against having a monthly payment that I can manage on my actual salary. 

Obviously there's a big opportunity cost and downside risk to moving so much of the appreciating equities into a home at what could well be the top of the housing market (and even if it's not, equities surely have a better long term rate of return than real estate). I could keep saving and investing and living in a 1 bedroom rental apartment for a long time and maybe I'd turn the $2m into $5m by the time I'm old. But my thinking has been, what's the point of that money at the end of the day? Shouldn't I grasp the opportunity to use it to leapfrog what would normally be possible at my stage in life in terms of quality of lifestyle and enjoy it, even if it doesn't maximize my net worth? What would I do with $5m in 30 years...buy a sweet house?

I'm beyond the point of no return now but I'm curious if this course of action deserves derision or validation. What would you do?",finance,1402721236

personalfinance,I think a payday loan is my only option,"Some background.  I fund /r/pf about 6 months ago after filing for bankruptcy.  I had about $20,000 in credit card debt, and about $30,000 in personal loans from parents.  I filed for bankruptcy, and discharged the $20,000.  This allowed me to focus on the $30,000 for the parents.  In addition, shortly after my discharge, I received a substantial promotion at work, and I now make about $70,000k a year.  By going hog wild on attacking the debt, I got the $30,000 down to about $20,000 in just 6 months following the bankruptcy.  

Now, since every single penny that I have left over each month has been going towards this private debt, I don't have an emergency fund... but an emergency has come up.

I have been sued for illegal downloading (don't really want to go into it here, but a word of advice... stay off the Pirate Bay without a VPN).  In order to keep my info from being released by my ISP, I'm settling this out of court before it gets out (I have a very sensitive job, and CAN NOT risk this going public).  

Anyway, I've paid the lawyer, but I'm probably looking at a settlement of $3,000.  Now, I'm getting a big bonus from work in mid-August (considerably more than $3,000).  I can't really borrow money from anywhere else since my credit it shot and I refuse to borrow from my parents/friends again.  

I feel like a Payday loan might be my only shot and they've already cleared me for the $3,000 at an insane interest rate.  If I do it this way, I will be paying an insane interest rate for the next two months, but then I can just pay it off.

So, I've been making personal progress in the financial area of my life. I've been able to build a budget and stick to it while saving money. My first goal was to reach $500 in savings as a start. Next I'd like to build that into 3 months worth of monthly expenses, and then build that to 6 months of expenses (which I believe is everyone's ideal theory). 
Without making too much information public I'd like to know what some people would do in my situation. I've made plans and goals but I quickly get lost trying to figure out how to pay off all my credit cards within the next two years (can be done quicker but I would be struggling week to week). 

The 5 credit card balances I carry are: 
$468.78
$536.45
$454.50
$762.50
$162.44
each with varying interest rates ranging from 12% up to a ridiculous 24.5%

My monthly budget is based off of the following bills paid:
-auto insurance $70
-electric $120 (cash to parents for that)
-phone/internet $200 (only option for internet, no provider has hi-speed available in my area)
-fuel $160 ($40 per week, 1/4 tank remain after 7 days)
-credit payments $200 ($50 payments over 5 accounts, but pay more on targeted balances)
-cash for misc $200 ($50/week for food and other)
=$950

with an income of $1200 month (average) plus $300 commission on 10th of every month
=$1500 monthly income

1500-950 = $550 month (leftover in theory, although I never really ""see"" this amount as leftover...where does it all go?!)

I've read Dave Ramsey's books as well as a couple of other financial 'gurus' for some ideas. Although I agree with Ramsey's plan for the most part, I find myself asking ""How much money does Ramsey think people have or make?!"" to reach those sort of numbers he talks about in his books? 

Now finally to the point:
 How can I pay off these balances within 2 years (although 12 months is my goal)

AND

save enough money to have 3-6 months of expenses saved up? 

Sure I could knock out the emergency fund first then start hammering away at the credit debt, but I would like to eliminate the debt so I can save even faster.

politics,"Currency, regulation, inflation, effort, and time: Is someone else is determining how much your life is worth?","**""Time is money.""**

 - a phrase used by Benjamin Franklin in *Advice to a Young Tradesman*

*Preface: I'm going to tie this back to politics, I swear. First off; this is not a conspiracy theory. I don't believe some shadow government has put this into effect. This is just a running analysis of how global economics affects individual lives, and the effect that politics has on that. This is something I've been musing about recently, and wanted to place it somewhere in a structured manner for some criticism. I know there are gigantic holes, citations needed, and other things here, but I'm just going to freight-train through it in hopes that it'll spark some useful thinking and discussion. I'd love it anyone has additions to this.*

**Time as money**

The reverse is also true. A currency unit is a physically tangible manifestation someone's time and effort spent to earn it. It is, quite simply, something that someone gives you so that you will spend your time doing what they want you to do. You desire it so that you may determine that others spend their time in a way that benefits you. You use this token to encourage farmers to grow your food, tailors to sew your clothes, and artists to produce works that you enjoy. 

**Time as power**

The physical currency unit is a result of society recognizing the only tradeable commodity that is intrinsic to every human: human effort. This is why slavery has existed since the dawn of man; controlling the time of others is the only true form of power; wealth means nothing if you cannot use it to change the behavior of other people, and why wage-slavery is an enormous issue in the world today. For some, the 'change' that owners of currency are seeking to influence may be as simple as the desire to possess objects that others have spent time crafting. For more sinister types, there are ideological ramifications.


**Time as punishment**

Time-theft is considered to be the ultimate crime; it's often referred to by the more popular nomenclature: murder. Incarceration is often considered one of the worst forms of punishment. Not only are they determining how (physically) you spend your time, but the punishing entity is training the confined party to spend their time in certain ways in the future. 

**Time, politics, and large numbers**

**Politics:** ""The activities associated with the governance of a country or other area, specifically relating to the the debate or conflict arising around the delegation and dissemination of funds and assets."" Politics is, as my professor once stated: ""Quite simply the process of deciding 'who gets what', and shouldn't be viewed as anything more."" I feel that's very accurate.

**Large numbers:** To talk about the immense amount of units that some specific people control, we have to understand large numbers, and how futile even the largest of grassroots efforts are in comparison. To quote from ehd.org's 'Grasping Large Numbers' article:^[1](http://www.ehd.org/science_technology_largenumbers.php)

&gt;Whether describing the vastness of the stars or the microscopic intricacies of the human body, the need to use large numbers is often inevitable. When we consider the estimated 200,000,000,000 (200 billion) stars in the Milky Way Galaxy or the estimated 150,000,000,000 (150 billion) galaxies in the universe or the estimated 100,000,000,000,000 (100 trillion) cells in the adult human body, we are forced to use numbers so large we cannot comprehend their meaning.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 100 one dollar bills measures .43 inches.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 1,000,000 one dollar bills measures 4,300 inches or 358 feet – about the height of a 30 to 35 story building.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 1,000,000,000 (one billion) one dollar bills measures 358,510 feet or 67.9 miles. This would reach blue sky: all the way from the earth’s surface into the lower portion of the troposphere – one of the major outer layers of earth’s atmosphere.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) one dollar bills measures 67,866 miles. This would reach more than one fourth the way from the earth to the moon.

Now, to discuss real numbers; the 2012 combined actualized national budget for the USA was $3.538^[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_federal_budget) *trillion dollars*.  Stacked one-dollar bills would reach over *four hundred and fifty five thousand miles*, or quite close to the distance from the earth to the moon. The total deficit (translation: taxpayers time that's already been spent) was $16.05 Trillion,^2 which would stack up to well over four times the distance to the moon, using one dollar bills

**One unit of currency is how much time?**

This is where it gets interesting to me. Who's time? The current (hopefully to go up soon, anyone?) federal minimum wage in the USA is $7.25. For a minimum wage employee, it takes 8 1/3 (ish) minutes to make one dollar. In Uganda,^[3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country) it would take a minimum wage worker over *two and a half weeks* to make one US dollar. 

**How much time are we talking about?**

The total sway of the US government's 2012 federal budget in 'US minimum wage worker hours' is 491,192,333,333.33 hours. That's 491.19 billion hours. Or, 56,035,019.39 years, if that's easier to wrap brains around. The federal government has that many man-years at it's disposal each year. 

I'm not even going to calculate that in Ugandan time to earning power ratio.

**The third world employee: post-scarcity, corruption, and corporate imperialism**

I have a theory. I believe that we are already living in what is essentially a post-scarcity world. 

I think that you'll find a common thread in every undeveloped or developing country; you'll find a few powerful individuals at the top who have total control; whether this be religious control (middle east),  control over natural resources (South America), or control by threat of violence. (Africa, North Korea) 

You'll also find exploration from outside the country by gigantic conglomerations of individuals who are bound together in one, and only one legally binding and life-threatening purpose: profit. We commonly refer to these entities as multi-national corporations, and this practice is regularly called 'outsourcing'. 

To be frank, I believe that currency is control. It controls the producers in undeveloped countries, while the much higher values and prices of people's effort in developed nations help keep the accessibility to power (the ability to determine how other people's time is spent) for all but a few to an absolute minimum.

**Currency markets, inflation, and interest**

Any non-representative currency is directly controlled by the issuer. They determine the interest rates of loans between central banks and treasuries, thereby controlling supply and inflation. 

The most poignant tool the issuer has, and the one it most often employs, trading of government securities open market operations. This allows almost direct control over how much 'time' (purchasing power) each unit has. 

Another tactic for determining the availability and potency of currency is a practice where the issuer buys treasury bonds, and then sells them back for more or less than they paid for them, effectively creating more available currency without actually issuing more. This is often where deficit numbers will change without any immediate explanation. This can make an administration look favorable in the eyes of constituents, even if the reality of the numbers tells a different story. We've seen this in the US in the last two years of the current administration.^[4](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TREAST)

**A few things that I've been wondering:**

* **Is our standard of living in western 'first world' nations propped up on the suffering of others?**

* **Why are we OK with an external force controlling the trading value of our time?**

* **Is there *anything* we, as individuals can actually do about this global wage-slavery/time-theft system?**

Does this seem like a viable solution?  Would this even work or was I being told this so the bank could make money of my (probably high) interest rate?",finance,1402784179
personalfinance,Question about student loan repayment,"I graduated in December of 2013, so my grace period is almost over (on the 17th, first payment is due by June 25th). I had $11,000 in student loans during the first two years of college, then I paid for the rest out of pocket each semester. I just paid off my first loan, a $2000 unsubsidized federal loan that was accruing 6.8% interest since August of 2010. I also paid off the interest on it ($485.30). I have another loan exactly like it ($2000, unsub, 6.8%), but I also have a $3500 subsidized federal loan at 4.5% interest and a $3,090 subsidized federal loan at 3.4% interest. I also have a super small $410 subsidized loan at 3.4% interest that I plan on tackling last, because it's so small.

Of those three remaining loans, which is smartest to pay off in bulk first? I'd like to make another bulk payment by the end of the year, and I'm not sure which one I should tackle next. Thanks for any and all help!",finance,1402786354

personalfinance,Saving for expensive house,"Let me preface this by saying I live in an expensive area of the country and this is the general prices around here.

26 year old married with wife, we save around 2000 - 3000 per month after bills, mortgage, student loans, etc.  I bought a house (375k) a little over a year ago and am already thinking 5 - 10 years down the road for my ""dream home"".  For our first home we only put down the minimum 3.5% because we were okay with paying PMI due to the super low interest rate we got.

For my next house (replacement house, not additional), I am aiming to buy somewhere between the 700 - 850k range, so I would like to have 20% down this time, a good safety fund, and some extra money to buy stuff for the new house.  I have estimated I will need between 180 - 230k saved up.

I have read on this forum that for people looking to save 20k or so to not bother really investing it outside savings accounts, CDs, I Bonds, etc because of such a short period of time, but I was wondering if there was anything different about this large amount of money.

I have looked into the following already:
Ally Savings - Already doing this (.84%)
Equity in the house - Guessing it will at least be 20k profit depending on housing market
Paying off student loans first - Already on this one, thats the only interest debt I have outside mortgage
Roth IRA - It appears you can only withdrawal 10k of your savings for your first house.
Money Market/Vanguard ETFs - Should I do this for a fund that I can withdrawal in like 5 - 7 years?
Federal I-Bonds - Will most likely invest the most I can, I believe its capped at 5 or 10k a year
CDs - Looking into them, better interest than savings.

Just wondering if anyone has any other suggestions that I did not mention.  If not I will most likely use a combination of all the ones mentioned above to diversify.  Any advice would be much appreciated!",finance,1402788920

personalfinance,Living on my own and going back to school this fall. Looking for advice on how to best cover my expenses.,"I'll be living on my own while going to college for the first time in just a couple of months and I have no idea what to do about my finances. Here are the basics:

-I'll be attending my state school as a second bachelor's student this fall. I already have a degree, but I need to go back in order to finish some prerequisite courses and bring up my GPA before applying to Physician Assistant (PA) school. I'm choosing not to go to community college because I already did that for 3 years straight out of high school and science courses taken at a four-year university are generally more challenging and, therefore, make for a more impressive transcript. Just for reference, the average annual wage for a PA is around $94,000.

-I was awarded $12,500 in federal loans for the 2014-2015 school year. The estimated annual cost for tuition and fees is $9,162 for an in-state student. Cost per credit hour is $317. I am currently registered for 11 credits, but may have to drop a class and only take 8 credits if I can't afford the former.

-I have yet to sign a lease for an apartment, but according to what I've looked at I'm estimating that I will probably pay between $650-750 per month for rent and utilities. I live in an expensive area and $650 would be insanely low. Living with my parents is not an option.

-Bills will be about $330/month for car, car insurance, phone, and gym. Actually, that should be even lower since I'm turning 25 in October and my car insurance is supposed to go down. But I'd rather round up.

-I will have a part-time job (at least 16 hours/week) making around $9.00/hour. It's definitely not the best paying job, but it counts as a ""preferred experience"" on PA school applications and since my biggest goal right now is to get accepted to a program, it's worth it. I've considered getting an extra part-time job, but I'm worried that my grades would suffer if I do. When I was in school for my first bachelor's degree I worked too much and got more than one F to show for it.

-I currently owe $14,866 in student loans. I've been making monthly payments, but they'll go into deferment once I return to school in the fall.

-I have next to nothing in savings to put towards expenses.

Based on my crude math, I'll be coming up several hundred dollars short every month to cover rent, utilities, bills, and other expenses that I failed to account for above (food, gas, etc). I've considered taking out private loans to make up the difference, but I've read nothing but horror stories about them. However, I've also considered that private loans would give me the ability to focus on school and get good grades so I can actually get accepted to PA school and start making money.

So, what should I do? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading!",finance,1402793186
personalfinance,Short term vs. long term CD,"Our emergency fund has grown to where it should cover our expenses for 6-9 months if we go through a loss of income scenario. I'm worried about the money sitting in a savings account, earning practically nothing, with inflation eating away at it. So we re considering putting about 75% of our emergency fund into a CD.

At first i was thinking we should go for the longest term, which is five years, so we can get the highest rate. Then i started thinking about the outlook for interest rates over the next five years and thinking whether it would be wise to do a shorter term CD, like two years. Then, at maturity, put the principal+return in a potentially higher interest CD.

What do you fine people think? What is your outlook on interest rates over the next two to five years?",finance,1402795216
personalfinance,Considering paying off my $19K car loan.,"As the title indicates, I'm considering paying off my car loan in full, $19K.  Payments are $360 a month, and interest is roughly 4.5%, with about 4.5 years to pay on it.  I'm out of the country right now and don't have the exact interest rate or duration of car loan on hand.  


I have $30K in savings, bring home $4,200 a month, $2K in credit card debt ($50 a month, which I also intend on paying off either way) renting out my house which I ""lose"" $75 a month by doing that, rent is $850 for myself, utilities are roughly $200 a month.  Gas is roughly $100 a month, car insurance $80, Cell phone $90, alcohol $100, tobacco $100, food $300, IRA contribution ($50) various other expenses $200 a month which all equals $2,505.  My Mortgage is $1,400 a month, and assuming the renters pay on time, I only lose $75 a month by doing that.  I look at the rent house as an investment though.  I can't afford to currently sell it either way, and the place that I'm renting is FAR closer to work.

Subtracting my take home income ($4,200) from my monthly expenses (2,505) equals $1,695 left over each month. 

I realize that I'm not investing enough for retirement.  I'm 32, for the record.  I would like to fix that while still having ample money to cover the mortgage for the house that I'm renting and any repairs that may come up.  

By paying off my car ($19K), that will leave me with $11K in savings.  $9K after paying off my credit card debt ($2K, about $50 a month payment).  From there, I can put the money for my car payment directly into retirement, so adding what I already invest ($50 a month) that will be increased to $410 per month.  That leaves $1,335 to either put into savings or just invest otherwise.  

Is paying off my car the ""right"" thing to do here?  

I have ZERO idea what I'm doing for retirement investment.  

I also apologize in advance if I've violated any rules here...this is my first post.",finance,1402795450
personalfinance,Allocation of savings into taxable vs tax advantaged account,"I am a single 23 yo that has just gotten his first salaried position, start date this Monday. I am working as a financial analyst at a credit union, making $35,000 a year. I was doing a very low paid internship at the credit union for the last 6 months and was able to average $750 (mint.com) of monthly spending (rent, utilities, groceries, gas.. etc etc). I plan to continue with this frugal lifestyle, perhaps spending ~$900 a month.

I have no debt besides monthly credit card bills, paid off in full each month, and intend to save virtually all discretionary income for the future. I plan to retire fully in &lt;20 years (I hope to increase my income dramatically over the next ~5 years, which could reduce this 20 year figure considerably) and am wondering how I should allocate my savings across taxable and tax advantaged accounts.


As far as 401k goes... I have a 50% match on up to 6% on top of a base 3% match (basically a 6% match). 

So here are some calculations based on 35k income..

With 6% match:

Gross income: $32,900

Federal Income Tax: ~$2,959

VA State Income Tax: ~$1,410

Social Security Tax: $2,170

Medicare Tax: $507.5

Take Home: $25,835.5

401k contribution + match: $4,200

Spending: $10,800

Total Savings: 25,835.5 + 4,200 - 10,800 = $19,235.5

Of this, $4,200 or 21.8% is in traditional 401k

I will presumably put $5,500 or 28.6% into Roth IRA leaving $9,535.5 or 49.6% in my taxable accounts.

I currently have ~20k in my brokerage account (Dollar cost averaging into index funds with future income, perhaps having a small trading fund on the side) and ~5k cash in my checking/savings account. I do not have any funds in any retirement accounts at the moment.

Given my low marginal tax rate of 15% and expectations of higher future tax rates, should I only contribute 6% to my 401k? Also... I am not positive all my calculations are correct. Any additional advice is welcome!",finance,1402796906
gaming,Ultima Online: Shadow Age (new AOS era server),"It's been 17 years since Ultima Online was released. For those who have played it before, I'm sure you remember the blood-pumping nostalgic thrill of the game. Much has changed since the glory days of UO, some for better, some for worse.

It is time to relive the thrill, the nostalgia, the blood-pumping 
adrenaline rush that we remember so long ago.

CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT


First things first, What is Ultima Online?
Ultima Online (UO) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), released on September 24th, 1997, by Origin Systems (Now owned by EA). The game is played in a fantasy setting similar to the other Ultima games that preceded it.

Ultima Online was the game that opened the door for the creation of many new massively multiplayer games. It is online-only and played by thousands of users on various game servers, also known as shards. It remains today, as the longest living MMORPG to date with a still active playerbase.

Because it was released before the DMC Act (1998), technically minded users are able to create and host their own freeshards using various UO emulators, like RUNUO. Those people are able to create, modify, and remove content as they see fit, without repercussion. Because of this, Freeshards have been growing and evolving since that time.

UO Shadow Age's era, AoS, was release in February 2003, and with it, brought a number of changes that many veteran players did not approve of, but also a number of changes that evolved UO into its highest subscription count.

What is UO Shadow Age?
Ultima Online Shadow Age, is a brand new freeshard created by seasoned UO veterans, professional developers, and UO enthusiasts. With the introduction of some brand new features never seen before, UO Shadow Age will provide the most attractive features for every type of player. We will be taking and fortifying the features that have become staples of AoS, and we will be changing and/or removing the features that majority of players didn't like, like trammel.

Our vision is simple, we will provide you with the best freeshard experience, period.

Because we are a new freeshard, we are trying to build our community from the ground up. We have an extremely talented dev team working with us. Please, if you've ever played on a server that didn't end up the way you like, voice your opinion on the forums. Give some suggestions so we can hear you out. A lot of what you see when we are live will have a lot to do with suggestions that we see.

GENERAL

Shadow Age Staff
Professional, dedicated, and enthusiastic staff. 100% Trustworthy GMs. ALL staff members will be available to players for in-game help. Look forward to staff that's actually online.
The UO Shadow Age staff is comprised of 2 professional developers, 1 professional web developer, 1 graphic artist, 1 market research analyst, 2 GMs with coding knowledge, and 1 GM with extensive AoS mechanics knowledge regarded as one of the best AoS PvP'ers of all time.

Community
Since UO Shadow Age is new, it's time to build a brand new community together.
A community that doesn't plague itself, promotes growth, and loves the systems that we can build for it. Become part of that community and spread the word to others. It starts with you. We are built off our communities suggestions. When enough people want to see a certain system in game, we will do our best to bring that system out. In this community, the players have the power to shape the game with their own suggestions!

Basic Mechanics
 * AoS (2003) Style Combat
 * AoS Style Item System
 * Felucca Only
 * 225 Stat (250 With Stat Scroll) / 700 Skill Cap (720 with 4 Months Gametime Reward)
 * Insurance included (Modified Costs For Higher End Armors)
 * Order/Chaos and 4 Factions (CoM, TB, SL, Minax) with enhanced systems

Completely REVAMPED Guild System
Out with the old and in with the new. The old system was simply a way to chat with your guild members and turn green to each other. We have completely revamped the way the Guild system works. Now, guilds are able to choose whether 1%, 2%, or 3% of all gold looted off monsters from members will be deposited into the guild treasury. Guilds can use this treasury to purchase different guild levels that give access to different perks. Perks (or buffs) last 1 week, their intensity increases as guild levels increase. You will also be able to use the Guild Treasury currency if you are a Guildmaster to purchase Guild Aid Items. You can get bonus Treasury by completing guild Achievements.

Fully Immersive Achievement System
Other servers have achievement systems that just don't cut it. Nobody participates in them fully and the rewards are meager. UO Shadow Age will be creating the first immersive achievement experience. Greater rewards for accomplishing in game feats. Rewards that scale with difficulty and make players want to go out into the world and complete them. Some will even be linked with the revamped guild system to offer treasury reward bonuses and other guild rewards.

New Housing System For Prolonged Server Health
We will be revamping the current housing system. There's a problem in today's servers. Players quit, and only log in once every few weeks to refresh the house that they have. This doesn't help the server or the server's economy at all. We will be adding a tax associated with the value of the deed for the house, or the value of the house's customization cost. The tax will be a small fraction of the house's worth per week. We believe that players that quit or log in once a week to refresh their house, then log out shouldn't be able to keep their home without playing the game. If this system makes them log in and hit up a few dungeons, then we've done our job. For those who are on extended leave, or going on vacation, gold will be automatically withdrawn from your bank to pay for the tax. So keep your bank stocked and you will be fine!

IDOC will be changed from the current way it works. Players will have 2 weeks and 3 days without paying before their house decays. The system works like this: Players pay tax at the end of each week from the time they placed the house. If the tax isn't paid that week, they will have another full week to pay the overdue balance and the current new balance. If they still haven't paid for the house after the second week, the home goes into foreclosure. You will now have to pay all the remaining balances for the home within the next 3 days. If that is still not done by the end of the 2 weeks 3 days, the property becomes owned by ""The Bank"" and will be demolished between 1-3 days later randomly.

This system will help promote in game activity, remove old houses from the game who's owners don't play anymore, and be a active recurring gold sink that will CONSTANTLY be removing money from the game.

Again, the tax amount will be small compared to the houses worth, so don't worry!

Factions Buffed
We will be focusing on promoting more PvP systems through the faction system. During the beta stage, we will be asking players what they would like to see the most with factions and will attempt to make some of the suggestions reality in game. Suggest some cool systems!
We will be asking the community for feedback on a lot of the systems that we propose before we go live.

Newbie Friendly
There will be 2 anti-PK, less loot dungeons available in the game for newer players to enter.
One of these dungeons will even have a champ spawn available. This champ spawn will still give out powerscrolls, however they will not go past +10 scrolls. We will also give aid to any players who plan on creating a main [NEW] guild. The headquarters of this guild will be in Britain, and people will be able to donate any items they want and new players will be able to use these items to help them get started in the game faster.

Doom And Artifacts
Doom and Artifacts are in. Artifacts will be scaled down slightly to not give players an overwhelming edge against other players. There are still stealable artifacts and rares throughout the game. Doom will be activated and will be a non-PvP zone that all players (Blues and Murderers alike) can participate in.

++ MORE
Not every new addition will be listed here, just some highlights. Rest assured, the dev team here will be working diligently to keep new content coming.

THE GOLD RUSH
Perhaps the biggest reason to play the game at launch. There's nothing like the exhilarating feeling during the beginning stages of a large shard. This is the time where players let their inner-gamer out, spending countless hours devoting themselves to the shard to become the richest person, the largest guild, the fastest 7x gm, the highest level guild, the highest achievements completed, the first 120'd out character. This only happens once in a shards entirety!

Paypal: $560     
Tax reserve: $1,990   (15% of my freelance checks. Actual tax accountability will probably be &lt;5-10%. Remaining funds will roll into next year's savings or pay next year's auto insurance.)  

Total resources: $3,730

**Current debt:**

Student loans: $78,491

IBR. $0 monthly payment, but I've been paying $80/month when possible.   
New payment will probably be $250-300.

EDIT: Loans are Federal Stafford Sub and Unsub. 6.8% interest rate with 0.25% interest reduction for using Direct Debit. I've already paid off about 5K since graduation. I work in the nonprofit industry and may qualify for loan forgiveness after certain conditions are met. I'm researching what steps to take for this.

We average $1,300 a month in expenses. I use Mint.com and spreadsheets to track finances. I try to keep a weekly budget. All monthly expenses go onto the credit card and are paid off as soon as I receive the statement. Credit score was 750 last time checked.

Car insurance is paid for the year. Car is old and reliable. We use prepaid basic cell phones. 

Biggest expense is food ($350-450), but I'm feeding 3 adults right now. I cook healthy meals at home and limit dining out. No alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs. Primary financial vice is skincare.

* Driving School - $600 (Partner needs license, affects employment)
* Get healthcare and dental coverage
* Savings - 15% of monthly income
* Emergency fund - 5% of monthly income


**3 Month Goals:**    


* Open Roth IRA -  $1,000 - 3,000.  
* Vision care - two eye exams, two new pairs of glasses 
* Dental care - cracked tooth, two cleanings  
* Auto repair - general maintenance
* Pet - vaccinations, emotional support certification   
* Weekend getaway - Inexpensive one-night getaway of privacy for my partner and I 
* One movie/museum/theater visit per month.


**6 Month Goals:**  


* Dental care - two restorations  
* Auto repair - replace shocks and struts  
* Move out - studio apartment in SoCal

We are currently living in sub-par conditions with abusive relatives. It's rent free, but I contribute $200 or more per month to their expenses.

personalfinance,"(NZ) Young, educated, now what?","Hi everyone, this has to be one of my fav subreddits. I love to see all these people help each other (hopefully) make good financial decisions. Now I'm asking for your help.

**Background**
I'm 22, Male, living in New Zealand. I have completed my tertiary studies and am debt free. I have great parents that always taught me to save and value long term investments.

Things have changed a lot since I was young(er). Mortgage interest rates have dramatically increased. In fact in New Zealand, the average person needs a 20% deposit to even get a mortgage with average house prices around 300k. 20% is a pretty large feat for a young student just finishing college. I can imagine how hard that is for someone with 30k of unpaid student debt too...

I'm putting as much as I can into the government Kiwisaver scheme (similar to your ROTH 401k?? I believe). I have a very good job paying me well and have put aside 45K NZD into savings. I've also completely paid off my student debt (30k) in the last year. My goal is to be financially independent and I understand that it will be much easier if I start now.

In terms of my expenses, I live at home (not for much longer due to finishing studying). I don't pay much rent (which is how I've been able to do this well so far). Other than that, just food and entertainment. I don't spend that much.

**Question**
I feel like I should move into the real estate market for an investment property and be negatively gearing that against my income for tax credit gains. Is this a good move? Real estate seems pretty volatile right now... What other investments could be worthwhile? Or any other advice for any aspect of my finances? What would you do in my situation?

Forex,USD/JPY weekly outlook,"USD/JPY weekly outlook – The U.S. dollar moved higher against the yen on Friday as concerns over escalating violence in Iraq fuelled safe haven demand while heightened expectations for more stimulus from the Bank of Japan weighed on the yen. USD/JPY was up 0.28% to 101.99 late Friday from 101.59 on Thursday. For the week, the pair was down 0.49%. The pair is likely to find support at 101.59, Thursday’s low and resistance at 102.50. Concerns over the ongoing Sunni insurgency in Iraq hit market sentiment on Friday, amid fears over the impact of reduced oil supply on global growth. The escalating violence in Iraq overshadowed a report showing that U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly deteriorated in June. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for June came in at 81.2, down from 81.9 in May, missing expectations for an uptick to 83.0. Earlier Friday, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady and indicated that the economy was on course to meet its inflation target next year without additional monetary easing. The central bank said the economy was showing signs of having weathered a sales tax increase that came into effect on April 1 and added that its expected a gentle recovery to continue. Analysts remain concerned that a slowdown in growth in the second quarter could prompt additional easing by the BoJ. Elsewhere, the euro edged higher against the yen on Friday, with EUR/JPY rising 0.26% to 138.18, not far from the four month low of 137.71 struck in the previous session. For the week, the pair lost 0.81%. The single currency has weakened broadly since the European Central Bank cut rates to record lows earlier this month, in order to combat the threat of persistently low inflation in the euro area. In the week ahead, investors will be focusing on the outcome of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, while a speech by BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Friday will also be closely watched. Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets. Monday, June 16 The U.S. is to produce data on industrial production and manufacturing activity in the Empire State. Tuesday, June 17 The U.S. is to produce data on housing starts, building permits and consumer prices. Wednesday, June 18 The BoJ is to publish the minutes of its latest policy meeting, which contain valuable insights into economic conditions from the bank’s perspective. Japan is also to release data on the trade balance, the difference in value between imports and exports. Later Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is to announce its federal funds rate and publish its rate statement. The announcement is to be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Thursday, June 19 The U.S. is to publish the weekly report on initial jobless claims as well as a report on manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region. Friday, June 20 BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is to speak at an event in Tokyo; his comments will be closely watched.

personalfinance,Roth 401k vs paying down student loans (expect income to increase 400% in 3 years),"I'm wondering if there is something that I'm not considering. Sorry for the wall of text and THANK YOU for your thoughts! :-)

My wife and I both graduated medical school a year ago and are in our residencies. We are paid about $50k/yr for the next 3 years, and then will both be specialists in fields that can expect to produce incomes of at least $250k/yr each.

Together, we have a total of $350k of federal student loans all at 6.8% interest (currently 6.55% interest given the 0.25% interest rate deduction for autopay).

We have been maxing out our Roth IRAs ($5,500 each) and using whatever else we can (about 28k this past year) to pay off our student loans.

We are considering contributing to either a Roth or Traditional (leaning towards Roth) 401k with some money that we have been using to pay our student loans. Our employer does not match any 401k contributions but we can do Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) 401k contributions. For now, lets operate under the assumption that my employer pays the fees associated with the 401k and there are funds that broadly follow the S&amp;P at competitive expense ratios around 0.1% available.

The disadvantage of this would be that we would be passing on a 6.55% guaranteed rate of return for a higher risk similar return in an ETF (but in a tax advantaged account).

The advantage would be that in 3 years, we will have about 100k (maybe more, maybe less, but I don't think the exact number matters as long as it is above 35k) to pay student loans and contribute to retirement, but only able to put 17.5k each into 401ks (either Roth or Traditional). We will be above the income limits to contribute to IRAs. The remainder (100k - 17.5k*2 = 65k) we will pay down our student loans with until they are gone. In years after we have paid off our student debt, we will be putting this 65k into non-tax advantaged accounts (pay income taxes when we earn the money, and then capital gains taxes in retirement). 

By contributing some money to a 401k now, we are increasing the amount of our student loans, but theoretically increasing the amount we are able to save for retirement in tax advantaged accounts by the same amount.

My plan is to pay the minimum income based repayments (about 12k/year, interest is about 23k/yr) on the loans, and put the rest into a Roth 401k. I could put the loans into forbearance and really put a lot into our 401ks, but by making the minimum IBR payments we are balancing our risk to some degree. I plan to use Roth 401ks because I believe our marginal tax bracket now will be lower than our effective tax bracket in retirement.

Do you guys think this is wise? Thank you again for your input!",finance,1402841678

personalfinance,Looking for some direction 24/M,"Long time lurker, sorry if this long winded and much appreciated if anyone replies.

Here is my situation, i'm 24, have an alright job that has good benefits, and have my expenses and income broken out below. I just have no direction. I get by just fine, not living paycheck to paycheck and am not buried in debt, but I just feel like I could be doing a heck of a lot more/better than I am.

Monthly income, 3350 after taxes, benefits, and my 401K contribution (I put in 10%, employer matches 3%, account has around 20k in it now).

I have around 1000 in my checking account, 7000 in my savings account.

Expenses Monthly
1. Car payment:450 (did the whole buy a fun car when I got out of college that I really didn't need route, still owe 10,000 on it but am ahead on payments, interest rate on the loan is 1.99% and the car is worth 20,000)
2. Car Insurance:200 (thinking I need to get rid of my old truck, this payment hurts and because of my age and my car is as cheap as I can get for full coverage)
3. Student loan: 400 (have a loan through my parents so no interest as long as I pay 400 a month minimum, have about 8000 left)
4. Rent &amp; Utilities: 600 a month
5. Entertainment &amp; Food: 350 a month
6. Gas/Travel Expenses: 200 
So expenses come out right around 2200 every month, leaving me roughly 1150 left over each month.

I had no savings account until I started working a little over two years ago, and for the first year of employment I had too much fun and didn't save anything, but didn't take on any extra debt except my car payment.

With all this said, what direction should I be heading? Should paying extra towards my car and/or college be the priority? Should saving up for my own house? I just don't have many people to relate to in my area (small farm town) so it's hard for me to benchmark where i'm at and to know where I need to be going.",finance,1402849155
personalfinance,"Tell me, what's the downside to investing 100k+ in P2P lending? (Lending Club)","To expand on the title a bit. No, I'm not advocating putting my entire savings in there.  Let's assume that the P2P lending account will only be 10 or 15% of a balanced portfolio. Let's also assume that liquidity is not an issue at all. And finally, let's assume that the money is diversified enough to where no more than .25% ($250) is in any single loan. 



As far as I can see, P2P lending offers the highest interest rates available. I've had my lending club account for over a year and I'm getting 13.5% returns AFTER charge-offs and expected charge-offs are calculated (For the record I have 20k in my account now.) However, as average loan life increases (more defaults), my returns will also slowly decrease. But I don't see it going anywhere under 11% at the lowest.



Finally, Lending Club has an automated investing tool, so I wouldn't be spending my entire life sitting in front of a computer and looking at loans. Once the principle is invested, I could most likely forget about the account while Lending Club compounds my earnings. 


Oh and one last thing. Lending Club charges a flat 1% rate for investors. Not as low as something like Vanguard, but 1% is still very reasonable for the returns available. 




Tell me, PF, is there anything I'm missing here? This sounds like a great opportunity. Again, it's not like I'm putting my entire life savings in here, the rest is the standard 75-25 stocks and bonds.",finance,1402854063

financialindependence,Traditional or Roth IRA for states with high taxes?,"Hi everyone,

I am a 23 year old software engineer living in the Bay Area making $82k. Currently I have a healthy emergency fund and HSA, no debt, and I have maxed out my 401k last month and looking to max out my IRA as my next step. I am wondering if I should be putting the money into Traditional or Roth IRA (with Vanguard) since I will be in the 25% (federal) and 9.3% (state) tax bracket.

I am planning to move to somewhere with a lower COL and lower/no state taxes so when I withdraw from my retirement accounts I don't have to pay state tax (if I understand correctly).

Thanks!

Edit: Forgot to mention that I am expecting a raise that will change my 12-month income to ~$120k in the next month or two. In which case I will be in the 28% federal tax bracket. I will probably not qualify for the Traditional IRA tax deduction but I will still be able to contribute to Roth IRA. I guess in this case I will be better off contributing to Roth instead (or what is the best way to tax-shelter this given the scenario that I will be moving to a LCOL area)?",finance,1402861533

personalfinance,Our friends are kinda rude about our debt. Does anyone else have this problem? How do you deal with it?,"It's got me feeling pretty down.

I consider myself extremely lucky because my parents are paying for half of my student loans. My younger brother didn't go to college so there was a lot of pressure on me to graduate. Grew up on welfare, food stamps, kindness of strangers, yada yada.  I was the first person in my family to graduate from university, so that was cool. But it left me with 100K in private student loans plus 10k in federal. I went to a public school, out of state. I applied for instate tuition for 3 years and was rejected each time (no idea why). Anyway, my parents are paying half of the private so I'm responsible for 60k worth of student loans. My husband has about 60k in student loans as well. His family was well off when he was little but due to very poor financial decisions they went from a net worth of millions to...very fucking poor. 4 kids, single mom who refused to apply for government assistance, &lt;$20k income. 

We both worked through school and pinched pennies. We worked very hard to overcome that poor-people mentality of spending money as soon as you have it because it might be gone soon.  Most of our friends at the time did not have any student loans and their parents paid for the rent/groceries/bills/gas and we're just not in touch with reality. One person told us when we graduated we should just put every paycheck towards out student loans, and we'd be able to pay them off ""in like five years"". Another asked why my husbands mom just ""doesn't pay for it [school]"". When my husband said it was because she had no money the friend said ""Well she can just take it from her savings"". She has no savings, because she's poor. 

Now that we've graduated things haven't changed, really. My husband has a good job. He makes enough that I get to put everything I make towards my student loans (about 800/month) and I get extra money to put towards federal loans. My husbands car is paid off and mine will be in a few years as well. We still pinch pennies. We have a small amount in savings (like 3K) and my husband puts 10% in his 401k. But our new group of friends also don't have student loans.

They don't seem to realize what a burden it is. They make comments about how we're cheap. Recently they've been making fun of us because our tv is small and we ""need"" to upgrade to a bigger one (as if a tv is some indicator of social status - it's super annoying. The tv works fine, we don't need another one). They give us trouble about renting instead of buying a house. They also always bring up that we cook at home too much instead of going out to eat with everyone - I work at a garden and get free produce, I'm sure as hell going to use it. I get a lot of shit for how much my schooling cost. Lots of ""you should have just gone to community college/instate school if you didn't want loans"" ""you shouldn't have gotten a useless degree"" type comments. Which is super insulting, and frankly, not even true. The out of state tuition for my school (missouri) was the same as instate of several schools where I'm from (new jersey). And it was fucking worth it. I have two degrees and I get to use that knowledge doing something I love. Also, when our cat was super sick and we spent a lot of money to make him better - one ""friend"" said if we were really having money issues we would have just put the cat down. We don't talk to that person anymore, but you get the gist.  

This makes them sound like shitty friends. They're not, we just don't take financial advice from them.

* My major is Accounting and my school competes with Harvard/Yale so I feel my job outlook is really great
* Mint says my income to date is $6700, however I'm also looking to switch from 2 jobs to one for double the pay which would also reduce my $125 for tolls to $0.
* Last year's total income was just under 10k, however I expect this year to be somewhere near 12-13k
* My credit score is about 720 and my parents are about 800 (they would be the co-signers for the loan) 
* I have two credit cards, one with 0 debt and the other is about $250
* I will be looking at about $5,000 in student loans as of graduation. 
* Expenses are: about $125/month to commute to work, $80/month in gas, $10 for gym and $25 minimum credit card payment although I usually do at least $35

investing,"FT: ""Central banks shift into shares as low rates hit revenues""","Central banks shift into shares as low rates hit revenues
By Ralph Atkins in London


Central banks around the world, including China’s, have shifted decisively into investing in equities as low interest rates have hit their revenues, according to a global study of 400 public sector institutions.
“A cluster of central banking investors has become major players on world equity markets,” says a report to be published this week by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (Omfif), a central bank research and advisory group. The trend “could potentially contribute to overheated asset prices”, it warns.

Central banks are traditionally conservative and secretive managers of official reserves. Although scant details are available of their holdings Omfif’s first “Global Public Investor” survey points out they have lost revenues in recent years as a result of low interest rates – which they slashed in response to the global financial crisis.
The report, seen by the Financial Times, identifies $29.1tn in market investments, including gold, held by 400 public sector institutions in 162 countries.
Central banks’ actions aimed at stimulating economies, including quantitative easing, have deliberately sought to push investors into riskier assets, and share prices have risen sharply since 2009 – leading to fears of stock market corrections if economic growth disappoints.
China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange has become “the world’s largest public sector holder of equities”, according to officials quoted by Omfif. Safe, which manages $3.9tn, is part of the People’s Bank of China. “In a new development, it appears that PBoC itself has been directly buying minority equity stakes in important European companies,” Omfif adds.
A chapter in the report on Chinese foreign investment trends argues Safe’s interest in Europe is “partly strategic” because it “counters the monopoly power of the dollar” and reflects Beijing’s global financial ambitions.
In Europe, the Swiss and Danish central banks are among those investing in equities. The Swiss National Bank has an equity quota of about 15 per cent. Omfif quotes Thomas Jordan, SNB’s chairman, as saying: “We are now invested in large, mid- and small-cap stocks in developed markets worldwide.” The Danish central bank’s equity portfolio was worth about $500m at the end of last year.
Overall, the Omfif report says “global public investors” have increased investments in publicly quoted equities “by at least $1tn in recent years” – without saying from what level, or how the figure is split between central banks and other public sector investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds.
Growth in countries’ official reserves has increased fears about potential risks to global financial stability. In a contribution to the Omfif report, Ted Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, writes: “Reforms are urgently needed to enhance the domestic and international transparency and accountability for this activity – in the interests of a better-functioning world economy.”
He adds: “Changes, real or rumoured, in the asset or currency composition of foreign exchange reserves have the potential to destabilise exchange rate and financial markets.”
Central banks around the world have foregone between $200bn and $250bn in interest income as a result of the fall in bond yields in recent years, Omfif calculates, without giving details. “This has been partly offset by reduced payments of interest on the liabilities side of the balance sheets,” it adds.

personalfinance,Intentionally withdrawing excess student loans?,"Hello everyone,

I was considering withdrawing student loans for college soon, but find myself in an interesting position... Unlike the large majority of cases, I am capable of passing through college without taking a single cent of student loans, because of an external source of income.

But I realized... the Stafford Loan's interest rate is only 3.86%, and the Graduate Plus has an interest rate of 6.41% with an origination fee of 4.288%... Following historical averages, the stock market tends to offer ~9.5% annual return.

Wouldn't this suggest that (so long as I had enough finances stored away incase the stock market takes a dip), it could be beneficial to withdraw the maximum possible amount from both to invest in the stock market? I was intending on throwing it all into Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 index fund.

&gt; * The Stafford Loan - (proposed expected return ~9% interest via Vanguard Indexes, interest rate of 3.86%). This should offer a 5.14% gain on all years.
&gt; 
&gt; * Graduate Plus Loans - (proposed expected return ~9% interest via Vanguard Indexes, 10.698% the first year, with 6.41% interest in subsequent years). This should offer a 1.698% loss on the first year, with a 2.59% gain on subsequent years.
&gt; 
&gt; *Because student loans may be utilized as a tax deduction, the profit margins should be increased further.


I know that the stock market does not follow linear trends, and carries inherent risk, but I see this as a calculated risk, with the averages tipped in my favor.



TL;dr
Don't need to withdraw student loans, but considering doing it anyways to invest in Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 index funds, as expected payout is greater than expected cost. Have sufficient ""rainy day funds"" incase stock market takes a dip. Does this seem like a good idea?

&gt;*Edit* My apologies to all replies, I forgot to state. I have near 0 concern or fear of paying off the student loans once I complete my education. I would not attempt this if I didn't have the superfluous funds to ""gamble"" with

&gt;Forgot this semi-relevant information, I tend to live frugally and have a guaranteed well paying job once I finish my education, so am not worried about my ability to pay off the student loans. The entire reason I am doing this is because I see it as having a greater probability of a profit, than a loss, which will aid me in reaching an earlier retirement.",finance,1402931382

personalfinance,Been out of college for a year and I'm lost [xpost r/studentloans],"Hi all,
So I graduated last year (May '09) and have been trying to get a grip on my debt ever since. Quite frankly I barely know what I'm paying anymore and I get destroyed every month.

I currently have (I assume 7 loans?): 

NJ Class loan 1 - Principle: 36000, 7.35%

NJ Class loan 2 - Principle: 20000, 7.35%

NJ Class loan 3 - Principle: 33000, 7.05%

Federal Direct Subsidized - Principle: 5300, 3.4%

Federal Direct Unsubsidized - Principle: 2200, 6.8%

Federal Direct Unsubsidized - Principle: 2000, 6.8%


So in total over 100k, I'm an idiot I know... My monthly payment currently sits at a painful $980. 


But that being said I have NO idea what to do. My payment is over $850 a month and it hurts. I would love to do an income based plan but I don't even know where to start that or if I should consolidate. I feel like it would be easier if they were all federal loans but not knowing a thing my mother and I confided in the financial advisor at my school at the time. My awesome credit score has taken a huge hit recently as I apparently have a ton of delinquent charges from missed loan payments. This was apparently some miscommunication about my deferment. I learned this when attempting to look into a SoFi loan and getting denied. Realistically I will be able to cosign with my parents on any future options. 


Other info: Current salary is $48k/year plus commission. I also am taking on a new national position later this month which should bump my salary. I participate in a 401k plan, have health insurance, and all that nice corporate stuff. I also carry a car loan with $6k left which is in very good standing. I do have credit cards, I use them sparingly, never amounting any debt over 30 days (Amex used mostly). 


If anyone has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it. Even a recommendation on someone to call for this kind of advice or help, hell I'll even pay for it at this point.

‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Offers Passport, Tax-Free Tropical Paradise for Wealthy Clients
Bloomberg By Jason Clenfield and Pavel Alpeyev 7 hours ago
He's known as Bitcoin Jesus in the world of cyber-currencies. Though he can't promise you heaven, he is offering a haven: a condo in the Caribbean that comes with a new passport and almost zero taxes.

Meet Roger Ver, ex-U.S. citizen, ex-convict, millionaire investor, self-described libertarian and founder of Passports for Bitcoin.com.

More from Bloomberg.com: ‘Bitcoin Jesus' Calls Rich to Tax-Free Tropical Paradise

The ever-expanding universe of what you can buy with bitcoins includes a hotel stay in Rome, a kimono in Tokyo, and cable TV in the U.S. Ver, a pioneer investor in bitcoin startups, now says he can add citizenship to the list.

Specifically, that's the right to live in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, two sun-kissed islands a three-hour flight from Miami. St. Kitts has run an invest-and-become-a-citizen program since 1984, making it the oldest of its kind, says the country's website.

Plunk down $400,000 for real estate and you get a passport that allows visa-free travel to 120 countries. There are no taxes on personal income or capital gains and the islands' restrictive disclosure laws offer shelter from outside scrutiny, according to the Tax Justice Network, a think tank that studies secrecy jurisdictions.

Ver's website, in English, Russian and Chinese, offers a way to purchase a piece of that paradise with bitcoins. He says it will help people who are hemmed in by government restrictions on cash transactions.

More from Bloomberg.com: Medtronic Is Biggest Yet to Renounce U.S. Tax Citizenship

""I'm going to China next month to explain to people that bitcoin is the easiest way to pay for things outside the country,"" Ver said during a meeting this month at the plush 51st floor lounge of Tokyo's Roppongi Hills.

Trader, Hacker, Boxer
A trim 35-year-old with a crew cut, in a black polo shirt and slacks, Ver looked a little like an electronics salesman at a big-box retailer. Still, a crowd of followers hung on his every word. A former derivatives trader at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a hacker, and a professional boxer were all there to pitch ideas or talk bitcoin with the master.

Ver got rich investing in bitcoin early and has become a regular speaker at industry conferences. He's provided seed funds for a dozen prominent startups including Kraken, an exchange where people buy and sell the digital currency, and Blockchain, an online wallet used to store it.

Bitcoin was invented in 2008 as a currency that could be used without government oversight. That's drawn people who want to trade illicit goods like drugs and guns. It's also gained support from libertarians like Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal who plans to build an artificial island where people can do whatever they want. Ver's passport site, his latest venture, is a scaled down version of that ideal.

Evade Taxes
""St. Kitts' government is much more libertarian compared with the U.S.,"" Ver said. ""It's not even close. So all these early bitcoin adopters, of course if they have the means, they'd rather be a citizen of St. Kitts.""

However they pay to get in, people usually seek out countries like St. Kitts so they can evade taxes, says John Christensen, director of the Tax Justice Network. The U.S. Treasury Department last month said the island's passports are being used to facilitate financial crime.

""To be blunt, we talk about places like St. Kitts as places where you go to escape from responsibilities,"" Christensen, an expert on tax havens, said by phone from London. ""St. Kitts sells secrecy on the international market and, unsurprisingly, attracts all types of dirty money.""

Gaining Citizenship
Erasmus Williams, press secretary for St. Kitts, didn't respond to phone calls or e-mailed questions about the Citizenship-By-Investment program.

A woman who answered the phone at the Office of the Prime Minister said the program is ""not a matter of buying passports, it's about gaining citizenship.""

Nonetheless, no residency or visit is needed, just that $400,000 investment -- re-sellable after five years -- or a non-refundable $250,000 donation to the country, according to St. Kitts's official website.

For those who don't get the message the first time, the site repeats in bold print: ""No personal visit required.""

Still, wealthy Chinese have a tough time buying in because government limits on money transfers stop them from sending more than $50,000 worth of cash overseas each year.

""The processing agent in St. Kitts told me he feels bad for all of his Chinese clients,"" Ver said. ""They have to reach out to all different friends and relatives and get them to all send the money in drips and drabs. Bitcoin solves all of that.""

Anonymous Ledger
That's because it was designed to be anonymous. While an online public ledger stores every single Bitcoin transaction, the entries don't include the names and addresses required for bank accounts.

In practical terms, a person in Beijing can buy bitcoins at home through BTC China, OKCoin or numerous other exchanges. With a few swipes on a smartphone, the money can then be beamed to St. Kitts with no government on Earth the wiser.

The U.S. lost its allure for Ver after he was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after selling about 14 pounds of explosive without a license on the EBay auction site. The product, ""Pest Control Report 2000,"" was basically a firecracker to scare birds away from cornfields, Ver says.

Locked Up
""I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't hurt anybody. I had nothing but happy customers and the U.S. government locked me in a cage because of that,"" he said. ""So I want nothing to do with those people. I don't want to support them. I want them out of my life.""

Ver moved to Tokyo after finishing probation in 2006. He got his St. Kitts passport on Feb. 13, 2014, and abandoned his U.S. citizenship by the end of the month.

""I would have done it the same day if I could,"" he said. ""They told me I had to have a one-week cooling-off period. They said, ‘Did you know if you renounce citizenship, you won't be able to serve in the armed forces?' It was like, ‘darn.'""

The U.S. is unusual in taxing its citizens no matter where they live. Recent laws requiring disclosure of foreign bank accounts has driven up the number of wealthy Americans looking to sever ties with home. A record 2,999 renounced their citizenship in 2013.

Although Ver's computer parts business made him a millionaire by the time he was 25, the real money came after he bought tens of thousands of bitcoins in 2011. They cost about $1 each then. Today they trade at about $600, according to the CoinDesk price index.

Bitcoin Evangelist
Ver said he earned his moniker, Bitcoin Jesus, by telling anyone who would listen about bitcoin well before other venture capital companies paid any attention to the digital currency.

One of the people who got a dose of Ver's sermons was the agent who processed his application for citizenship, Paul Bilzerian. Bilzerian is a former corporate raider who moved to St. Kitts after long battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and two stints in prison for securities fraud and conspiracy to defraud the government of millions.

The two men bonded over the belief they'd been targeted by U.S. authorities, according to Ver. Together, they started passportsforbitcoin.com in April, Ver said.

Bilzerian, who is one of several-dozen licensed government processers in St. Kitts, declined to comment in an e-mail.

Their website says a second passport insulates you from governments that intrude on citizen's lives. The site also has testimonials from Ver and Bilzerian's son, Dan, a 30-something professional poker player with millions of followers on Instagram, where he posts pictures of himself with half-naked women, along with his gun collection. He didn't respond to e-mailed questions forwarded through his press agent.

""I value freedom more than almost anything else and a second or third passport provides me insurance just in case the U.S. government decides to value security over freedom,"" Bilzerian's son writes on the passport website.",cryptocurrency,1402952362
personalfinance,Funding the purchase of Stock Options,"My parents are in a situation where they can purchase stock options.  They want to hold whatever stocks they purchase for one year so they can only pay capital gains taxes rather than income taxes.  In other words, they don't want to do a cashless transaction where they purchase and sell the stocks in the same transaction and pocket the difference.  We are hoping the options will be at about an 80% discount (the stock will be 5 times more than what the options are priced at).

So the question is how do they come up with the cash to purchase the stock?  They can either use their emergency fund or their home equity line of credit that has an interest rate at 4%, or a combination of the two.  

Would you guys clear your emergency fund to purchase stock options, or borrow and have to pay the interest (which is tax deductable)?",finance,1402954372
Bitcoin,uneven bitcoin mining distribution,"Hello,

I might have missed something, however it seems that the majority of people discussing the ghash.io mining distribution issue centre around the issue of the so called %51 attack, which then generates debate on if the %51 attack is desirable, possible, feasible, practical, etc.

However, my concern is different. My understanding is a mining pool with 51% distribution gets a 51% say in what transactions get included or not included in the next block. Don't like somebody, and can identify his address? You can delay his transactions. Don't like the feds selling 30,000 bitcoins? Delay that transaction too.

Probably can't delay the transaction much with only %51, however, if that increases, the potential to delay transaction will increase.

The worse case scenario, which is unlikely to happen, if a pool gets 100% distribution, or close to it, you can completely block undesirables from making transactions.

I might be wrong, however It concerns me that some of the solutions being proposed address the 51% attack, and other related issues, but fail to take into account some of the more fundamental problems.

e.g. I can't see anywhere that says p2pool solves this problem. Hypothetical question: if 100% of Bitcoin mining was on distributed p2pool nodes, would the decisions on what transactions get included be decided centrally, for the entire pool, or for every node in the pool?

personalfinance,I figured you guys might enjoy a discussion on banking capabilities of minors,"So I opened a Fidelity Cash Management Account a few weeks ago. It's basically a brokerage and checking account combined, and it had some of the best benefits I've seen for any sort of checking account. Today I called with a question about a funds transfer, and they ended up telling me that they will probably need to close my account since I am under 18. They said that my account never should have been opened and it must have been a glitch in their computer systems. Anyways, I immediately ordered an EFT back to my checking account at Chase and was told to call their risk management department tomorrow to decide the fate of the account. 

I will probably end up converting this account to a joint registration with my parents, but I'm eighteen in a few months so honestly this is just an inconvenience. But I'm interested in learning a bit more about the compliance issues here. I thought it was just up to banks whether or not they would allow minors to have a sole ownership account. I live in NY, but found an Illinois law seeming to support this: ""(205 ILCS 5/45.1) (from Ch. 17, par. 356) 
Sec. 45.1. Accounts for minors. A state bank may accept deposits made by a minor and may open an account in the name of such minor and the rules and regulations of such bank with respect to each such deposit and account shall be as binding upon such minor as if such minor were of full age and legal capacity. The receipt, acquittance or order of payment of such minor on such account or deposit or any part thereof shall be as binding upon such minor as if such minor were of full age and legal capacity. 
(Source: Laws 1965, p. 2020.)""

Tl;dr: More generally, what types of regulations govern what types of account minors can hold? I understand minors can't enter into binding contracts, but can minors purchase securities? or be the sole owner of a checking or savings account?

**Update:** So minors can't own securities at all, even if it is joint with their parents. Therefore my accounts being closed. These regulations seem a bit restrictive, I don't know if it's just company policy or what, but they cited SEC regulations. So I'll just hold off on investing for the next few months and let my money sit in a savings account with shitty interest rates being cannibalized by inflation.",finance,1402964691

personalfinance,Why is the 401(k)'s tax-deferred status is a good thing?,"I've been reading introductory personal finance stuff and I'm seeing statements like the following, via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k\))

&gt;  The resulting compounding interest with delayed taxation is a major benefit of the 401(k) plan when held over long periods of time.[8]

And, from page 78 of Ramit Sethi's *I Will Teach You To Be Rich*

&gt; Sure, you'll pay taxes when you withdraw your money later, but that extra 25 percent turns out to make a huge difference as it gets compounded more and more.

But as far as I can tell pre-tax and post-tax yields the same net result; without taking tax into account, the formula for [compound interest with continual contributions] (http://www.moneychimp.com/articles/finworks/fmbasinv.htm) is: c[ ((1 + r)^(y + 1) - (1 + r)) / r ], where c is the contribution, r is the interest rate, and y is the number of periods. Since c is factored out, taking tax into account by multiplying c by (1 - (the tax rate)) (that is, after-tax contributions) is equivalent to multiplying the whole thing by (1 - (the tax rate)) (that is, before-tax contributions). Am I missing something, or are the main benefits of the 401(k) just the potential company match, the potential for its contributions bumping you into a lower income bracket, and the potential for being in a lower income bracket when withdrawing during retirement?",finance,1402968353

1. $10k 3.4% and $10k 6.8% student loans = $20k total

2. roth ira through vanguard

I maxed this out in 2013 ($5500) once I found out my employer doesn't do any 401(k) matching. My goal is to max this out in 2014 as well.

I'm thinking I should pay off my 6.8% loan in full/at least over the next year or two and leave the 3.4% loan for my scholarship.

personalfinance,Sell/shut down my business?,"OK- First post, so if I'm omitting something or doing something wrong, please let me know.

I own a real estate escrow company in the state of CA. It is a small company with two employees, not including myself, and have been operational for almost a year. The overhead for the company has been WAY more than I anticipated- between licensing, insurance, and payroll, the monthly outlay has been consistently frustrating. It feels as though each month our revenues increase, there's some other increase in expenses I didn't account for. 

YTD gross revenues through the end of May are at roughly $98k and net income is at about $15k. During that period, I paid myself roughly $6k. June is set to be another loss, but July is setting up to (possibly) be in the green. I hate to even hope. 

The company is required by law to hold a minimum amount of $75k in assets. It does, and that money is the majority of what I have to my name. The money is untouchable or we're in violation of our licensing terms. 

On the emotional side, the business has turned out to be a frustration and a disappointment. As the owner, I spend very little time ""working in"" the business, but my work on the business (to grow it) has proved useless. I recently had a baby and my goal was to have this thing up, running, staffed, and generating nice passive income to me. Instead, I feel like my time is divided between being a mediocre business owner (because my heart's not in it) and mediocre mom (because I'm trying to also run this business).

My husband and I are trying to buy a house, but need to address some debt before we would qualify. The escrow company does not add to qualifying income right now, and we don't have the money to pay off the debt. We're talking about me shutting down the escrow company so that we can use the money its holding. My worry is that I then have no other means to add income to our house, and buying a house means our monthly expenses go up - so my income, however small, become even more important. 

Additionally, we want to buy the house to offset a MASSIVE tax liability. My husband is also self-employed. We're getting buried in income taxes year over year because we don't have enough write offs and feel like if we don't get the house now, we'll never catch a break. We're stuck in this middle/upper-middle class catch 22 where we have enough money to live and pay taxes or live and continue advancing financially, but not both. 

I can sell the company for the capital it holds, plus probably another $30k.

The coins themselves are nearly worthless for the following reason.

**The participants of the auction must both register and deposit $200,000 USD.**

As Bitcoin is treated as property by the IRS, the bitcoins will be taxed 3 times.

**Once for the sale at the initial auction, and TWICE when you spend it due to IRS laws on Bartering.**

http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc420.html

*""Bartering occurs when you exchange goods or services without exchanging money. An example of bartering is a plumber exchanging plumbing services for the dental services of a dentist. You must include in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods or services received from bartering.""*

Suppose you had $200,000 for Bitcoins. You will first be paying 9% sales tax in California. You can buy $182k in Bitcoins.

Because you had to register with the auction and due to the public nature of the ledger, the IRS will be able to instantly know when you move that Bitcoin. Congrats, you will be paying 28% federal income tax on that bartering and an additional 9% state income tax. The person receiving those bitcoins and giving you something in return will ALSO need to pay 28% + 9% tax.

Your $200,000 worth of bitcoins will result in $130,000 worth of tax revenue for the Government from a single trade.

**Best Case Scenario: Government bitcoins you get will be worth less than a third of the value of non-government bitcoins of an equal amount.**

Worst Case Scenario: If Government law considers Bitcoin users to be part of a Bartering Exchange, meaning you are legally responsible for record keeping and reporting the person you are bartering with. Not only will you need to be registered and identified, so will every person you trade with. In such a case, those Bitcoins will be worth 0.",cryptocurrency,1402985218

personalfinance,"How does refinancing a car loan work, and is it worth it?","Hello /r/personalfinance!

I've seen a number of ads, and I've received a number of spam letters in the mail, about refinancing for car loans.  I consider myself a generally smart person, but I honestly have yet to be able to wrap my mind around the possibility of somehow going to another lender and paying less.  It just seems like it shouldn't actually be possible to take $X in dollars owed, and somehow shuffle that and move it so that I owe someone else, but end up owing less than what I owed previously.  It makes senses for houses, but not for a straight-up depreciating asset like a car.

Can someone explain to me the basics of refinancing  a car loan (ELI5?) and whether or not it would be useful to my situation?

For specifics, I'm a little over a year into my 72-month note.  The note is for ~$25k and I currently pay ~$360/month, with an interest rate of ~5.5%.  The payment is fine, I can comfortably afford it, but I'd rather pay less, and save the difference, if at all possible. :)",finance,1403007927

personalfinance,"On Debt, Taxes, Marriage, and Student Loans","I hope this is the right place to post this. The Student Loan sub look like it was more for people taking out new loans.

My husband and I have been together for 8 years and married for one. We generally keep separate finances outside of a joint credit card that we pay off completely each month. That being said, we both individually have a lot of debt. We are trying to decide if we should apply for IBR on student loans together, or continue to keep this part of our lives separate. Other than that, our finances are not fantastic, but we are also not living in poverty. We know that owning a new car, house, or other traditional newlywed items are not in our future and have generally accepted that.

Neither of us really has the option to pay more than the current minimum monthly payments. We have a budget and try to stick to it, but there isn't much wiggle room. We live in an expensive Northeast City, so you can assume our other expenses in that arena. I don't anticipate either of our incomes changing for the next ~1-2 years (despite this burden, we are trying to not let it get in the way of career happiness!)

business,"How to Find a Financial Advisor You Can Trust (Yes, There are Plenty of Them Out There!)","You’ve come to a pivotal point in your life when you have made the decision to bring a financial advisor into your future plans. You’re making the right decision. Now, you’ve got some work to do; it takes a lot of research to know how to find a financial advisor that will fit your needs.
 
Most people find their investment advisor by talking to friends and family about where they put their trust. Perhaps the best advice comes from people who are in a similar position in life, like age, income, and investment goals. 

Once you get feedback that you know you can trust, take it a step further and look up your friends’ and family’s finalists online. Checking them out on LinkedIn (or simply doing a Google search) could give you a fairly good sense about their firm. You can also go to the websites of Financial Planning Association and the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) to profile advisors that could fit your needs.
 
Obviously, cost will be an issue in determining whom you will choose. Not all rates are available online, which means you’ll want to put a call in to the office. Make sure to ask about any possible hidden fees. Many times, a reliable and consistent advisor will be a fee-only advisor, which means they don’t earn commissions. This compensation method allows your advisor to approach investments with a completely objective opinion and won’t be swayed by a healthy commission on an investment that does little for you.
 
When interviewing potential advisors, ask for their credentials and their certifications. Look for CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP®), as this type of certification is one of the mostrigorous to obtain. Also look for Chartered Financial Consultants, registered investment advisors, and certified public accountants. A certified public accountant who also helps people manage their financial affairs, including investments, should also have a personal financial specialist certificate.
 
Ask your prospective advisor what specific services their firm provides. Most have a specialty area, based on the experience of their team. Some firms will offer a team approach that can handle insurance, estate planning, retirement planning, and tax planning all in one shop. It’s okay to ask several questions; you can’t be expected to know how to find a financial advisor that you can trust without asking for the specifics. You may want to look for a professional investment manager that focuses solely on investments and related portfolio activities, rather than splitting time in many other areas. 

You should get a fairly decent perspective on what type of clients your prospective advisory firm deals with primarily by looking at their website. If you notice that they have a niche that doesn’t quite fit your profile, it probably won’t be a good fit. 

Finally, consider your communication style and needs. Everyone is different when it comes to the support they need from their advisor. Some people want an advisor who is open to frequent contact, which means they’d be really uncomfortable with an advisor who meets with them only once a year. Some advisors will meet their client for the initial contact and then only go over investments with them once a year. This is great for some and not-so-beneficial for others.
 
Family Investment Center is staffed with professionals who are fee-only advisors. We will not make decisions based on commissions, and there are no hidden fees for their services. Call us today.",finance,1403026881

Bitcoin,Forcing bitcoin useage.,"Has anyone thought how to increase adoption by forcing users into using bitcoin?

I think one of the biggest magnets has been the price increase, but the problem is the sustainability. People tend to leave once the market turns south.

Looking at various money systems such as gold and fiat, what keeps people in seems to be debt. Once they borrow gold/fiat they must constantly seek it out.

What bitcoin is missing is a proper lending market, but also one that is enforceable.

I propose a start up where bitcoin loans are issued, and the borrower must produce all social media information that can be used to shame them incase of none-payment. A type of social peer pressure to honor their commitments .

The lending market will be hugely beneficial to the early adopters.

It will stop the hoarding of bitcoin and allow them to earn a perpetual interest rate. Understanding that bitcoin is already deflationary, interest rates would be very low. A compound rate of under 5% per annum.

CryptoCurrency,What is important to you all? What should/can the government do/not do that would help crypto currency?,"Hello guys. My name is Kyle Davis, and I am currently a candidate for the State House of Representatives here in Colorado. I am running on a platform of scaling back the role of government in our daily lives by repealing laws that run contrary to personal liberty, and nullifying federal laws that infringe on the rights of our state and the people. 

The entire concept of competition and voluntary interaction, especially in regards to things such as currencies, is something I see as vital. Seeing this huge boom in cryptocurrency has been extremely exciting to watch and be involved in. Sure, the market for these CC's seems saturated, but that's only for the time being; the cream will rise to the top soon enough, and we will see a few of them sticking around making a big impact. Hell, in such a short amount of time, we've seen Bitcoin go places hardly anyone could have imagined, and it is doing so because the government has thus far stayed out of the way. 

So this is my question to the CC world: what can the government do to ensure that CC's can continue to grow? Should governments be doing anything to ensure the safety of investors, miners, customers and merchants? Is there a place for state governments in regulation? Or, is the best thing for the government to do is to stay out of the way and let the market for CC's do what they do? If that is the case, is the best response no response at all, or should governments be proactive in ensuring that the market for CC remains free?

personalfinance,"Will most likely graduate dental school three years from now with about $220-240k in student loan debt at the age of 25. Its early, but help me grasp my financial situation then.","I'm currently 22 years old on summer break after finishing my first year of dental school. I attend an in-state public school, and take out loans of about 55-60k a year to cover my tuition and all living expenses. A little more than half are Unsubsidized Stafford loans with a rate of I think 3.8%, and the rest are Grad PLUS loans with a rate of I think 6.4%. I don't know the rates as specifically as I should, and as I understand it the interest rates are actually variable year to year as set by the federal government but I'm not exactly sure.

In this case I'll assume I graduate on the upper-end of my loan estimate ($240,000) with an aggregate loan rate of something like 5.5%. I guess this also highly varies with what my income ends up being. USNews says national median salary for dentists is about $145,000, but being a fresh graduate I'm aware I'll likely make much less, so let's say my income is $100,000 to have a clean number.

More or less what I'm trying to figure out is what standard of living I can expect. I'm aware its not a great idea to buy a brand new car first year out of school, I guess I'm just wondering if there's a general formula for how much of your income you normally spend on different things. For example, if I took out that $240,000 loan at a 5.5% rate and paid it over 15 years, my monthly payment would be $1,961. Is this reasonable? Too high of a monthly payment, or should I try put more in to it to get the loan paid off sooner? What can I expect to budget for rent, what kind of car could I afford and how long should I wait?

personalfinance,Should I just pay my fiancee's student loan balance in full?,"I'm getting married in a few months. My fiancee has $120k in student loan debt with outrageously high interest rates as is typically the case these days as I understand it (some at 6.55% and some at 7.65%). 

Currently she is getting income based repayment from her school which basically covers the interest only so the principal balance hardly moves. Once we get married, due to my higher income, she will no longer be eligible for her school's income based repayment. I don't know the full details but I understand that she will still be eligible for one of the federal repayment assistance programs and ultimately for loan forgiveness. She hopes to work in public interest and would therefore qualify for 10 year public interest loan forgiveness, but currently has private employment that doesn't qualify, so that's speculative. If she never gets 10 years of public interest employment she could still be eligible for the 25 year regular federal forgiveness. In order to achieve any of that though, we'll have to file our taxes separately, which tends to be disadvantageous.

Given the high interest rate on her debt, it seems like it might make sense for me to just pay off the entire balance with my separate property in order to maximize our family's long term earnings/assets. Of course, if she could actually get the loan balance forgiven, then that would be better than paying off all the loans now. But it's hard to evaluate the likelihood that that would actually happen (indeed, I understand there are proposals floating around to cap or eliminate loan forgiveness). And if she doesn't get it forgiven, then we're going to wind up paying a whole lot more than $120k over the life of the loan, almost surely more than we could expect that $120k to turn into through investing.

Any suggestions on how to evaluate this scenario? It's hard to come up with a formula to plug all the variables into but this isn't the kind of decision I can reasonably make on instinct - I need to put in some assumptions about the likelihood of various possibilities and then see what the total outlay and expected value could be over time!

So basically, the only way they could sell me the car at a rate I was comfortable paying was by putting it in my dad's name and making me a cosigner. So I'm wondering what options I have, if any. I have horrible credit (I didn't know I was supposed to be paying fedloan for 10 months), my dad's credit is better and has gotten a lot better of late.

Could the car loan be re-negotiated at a lower rate somehow if he was the sole owner? If it was billed to him and in his name but paid by me?

Could I trade in the car for something less expensive even though I have a loan on the car? Perhaps a car that doesn't double my insurance...

Could I go back in time and throw a rock at myself before I signed the papers?

personalfinance,Downsize truck now or later? (CA),"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some help in my current situation. Another ""bought a vehicle I shouldnt have"" scenario that i've read all too much about ...after i bought it. Here's the situation: (please note all figures are Canadian dollars)

In Dec of 2012 I bought a big pickup truck. I do a lot of driving from a rural town into a big city or out to the coast to surf every weekend. I bought a truck because I need room for my board and wetsuit bins, as well as camping or ski gear - I don't want to mess around with dirty gear in the cab or strapping boards onto the roof.

Truck price was $57700 incl tax. Pre-tax price was 51500. I bought it using a line of credit that only required interest only payments for the first 18 months, and interest rate is 3%. To date, I've paid down about $17000 of it, lets say ~$40k to go. I'm paying it down aggressively as I can (ie almost $3000 this month). I've put about 28000km on it in the past year, corresponding fuel bill was $4600. 

A quick KBB/autotrader/craigslist search has the truck going for around $43-48000

Next May (2015), I'll be moving to a city and will be screwed if I try to keep my truck - fuel consumption is going to skyrocket even more than it is driving in stop and go traffic, and the truck's sheer size limits me in terms of finding parking and even where I can live (ie won't fit in most underground lots).

I still plan on doing surf and ski trips (maybe not every weekend) and may have to drive through some snowy sketchy highways for work now and then. So, I'm looking to downsize to a smaller truck like a Toyota Tacoma that will still let me fit in smaller spaces (and not be as bad on fuel). I'm thinking of looking for one that is 2-3 years old, and selling for around 30-35000.

My question to all of you is: should I wait till next year to do this? or do it now before my truck depreciates more and to take advantage of the better fuel economy? I know I'm going to take a big $ hit regardless, but I can't wrap my head around how to time this.

Thanks. If I've left any important info out, just ask.",finance,1403069332

personalfinance,"My uncle, cosigner on my private student loan, died last night. I'm worried about what's going to happen next.","My loan originated with Citi and was sold to Discover. It entered repayment a month ago.

The details are : 

28,426.62 balance

$279.65 minimum payment

8.5% interest with auto-payment .25% reduction

My plan was to pay $700/month and get this loan paid in around 4 years. 

My income is 40k gross, 2k take home per month. I pay $600/rent and $200/groceries. My phone bill is $60/mo, electric is $40-50 and I already live pretty frugally. I have $65k in federal loans that I'm currently paying in IBR with interest rates around 6.8%. My plan was to pay off the private loan as fast as I could then move onto federal loans. 



I've read that death of a cosigner triggers automatic default. There is *no possible way* I can pay this loan if they demand it all upfront. I haven't posted all the details PF likes to see because I'm not asking about what to pay off, I'm just asking what my next step should be. I just don't know. 


If they auto-default my loan, am I screwed? Will it destroy my fiance's credit if we get married?

If the cosigner then becomes my uncle's estate, what happens then? I appreciate any help you guys can offer. I just don't know what to do. I've tried looking for the info on the discover student loans site and I can't seem to find anything related to this. I'm happy to respond with any other info you need. 


**EDIT**: There's no one else to cosign. I have no other family/friends that could or would (and rightfully so). 

Edit 2: Lots of conflicting information here. I'm still not sure whether or not to call discover. What I will do is get my contract and read through it. If this is not spelled out then I will contact customer service anonymously and ask. Thank you to all of those who provided sincere advice. 


FINAL EDIT: 

To clear some stuff up: 

1. Yes, I have a lot of student debt. I had no family or help. I had no means to attend and even with my job I couldn't afford it. Housing is expensive when you don't live with your parents. My parents never taught me anything about money and I made bad choices. Oh well, I can only grow from here. My degree was in STEM, btw, and I ended up going into IT (not what my degree is in) because the science jobs here paid so little. It took me a year after graduation to get here. 

2. I'm devastated. My uncle was one of the only people who accepted me. This isn't a sub about how I feel about my uncle, though. I'm not insensitive for trying to keep my affairs in order, but if you think that I am, well good for you. 

3. I'm going to post an update to this regardless of how it goes so that there's something here when someone else searches /r/personalfinance for it. Wish me luck.",finance,1403085479

Tragically, all we’ve fought for in Iraq, all that 4,500 American lives were shed to gain, is on the cusp, potentially, of vanishing.

- Mitt Romney, “Ideas Summit,” 6/13/2014
mission-accomplish BEST
All we fought for in Iraq.
All we fought for in Iraq is on the cusp of vanishing.
That’s what Mitt Romney says.
We fought for. We fought for. We.

Oh, so it’s we now, is it, Mitt?
We.
I must have missed you over there, but it was a busy place. We. The guy who helped set up “pro-draft” rallies and yet somehow managed to avoid service in Vietnam is upset about losing what “we” fought for? We.
Yeah, fuck you, Mitt.
And you’re all welcome to quote me on that.
Somebody stepped into my office yesterday and asked how I felt about it.  He wanted to know how I felt about “losing” Iraq.
How do I feel about losing all we fought for?
I don’t know.
First, I’m going to need somebody to explain to me exactly what it was that we were fighting for.
What was it? What is it that we gained, according to Mitt Romney? And what is on the cusp of vanishing? What is that? No, really, somebody please explain it to me.
Because I’d love to know.
The Wikipedia says Operation Iraqi Freedom started on the 20th of March, 2003, which is just another reason why you shouldn’t believe anything you read in the Wikipedia (don’t, just don’t).  That’s not correct, the war began a day earlier.  See, I was there on the night the war really started, at precisely 2200 hours, on the 19th of March in the Northern Arabian Gulf.  I was there when US Navy SEALs and Polish GROM stormed the MABOT and KAAOT oil terminals a full day before Saddam Hussein discovered that his time was finally up.  In point of fact, I had arrived there four months before, a few days before Christmas in December of 2002. From the day of my arrival (and before that really) to the day the war started, and for months after, I was a Navy intelligence officer working in support of the invasion force.  There’s not much I don’t know about the events leading up to war and the aftermath of the invasion.
Well, not much except for that one little detail.
Why.
All these years later, and I still don’t know why.
Oh, I mean, I know what they told us, sure, Saddam Hussein attacked America on 9-11.  Right? That’s what they said, that’s what the Commander-in-Chief told us. Saddam Hussein was in league with Al Qaida, remember? The son of a bitch and his stinking nation of terrorists attacked us. The Iraqis had it coming. And Georgie Boy was going to finish what his daddy started. Hooray! Right? That’s what they said.
Except those of us in the professional intelligence community looked at each other and thought, wait, what? How the hell did we miss that? Saddam and Osama bin Laden are working together? Buwah? But Rumsfeld, he had his own little extra-constitutional intelligence outfit staffed with his simpering cronies who he paid to blow smoke up his pinched grey ass until his colon resembled beef jerky and he sure didn’t have much use for us – after all, we were just the military he had.
Ours, as they say, is not to reason why, ours is to but do and die, right? At least that’s what Rummy told us and you know, you go into war with the Secretary of Defense you have, not the one you’d like to have. And if Rumsfeld says he’s got the real scoop, it must be true? Right? Sure, that justifies his contempt for us, sure it does.
Except, Rumsfeld’s little masturbation fantasy turned out not to be the case.
But hey, never mind that, Saddam Hussein was threatening us anyway, wasn’t he? Sure he was, in fact, that’s the first time you heard the phrase “Weapons of Mass Destruction” isn’t it? The bastard had nukes and germs and war gas and he was just itching to use them on America, wasn’t he?  Heck we even had pictures of “mobile weapons labs” to prove it, isn’t that what Colin Powell told the UN and the world? And by damn Saddam had been buying Yellow Cake uranium from Niger, right? Colin Powell wouldn’t lie to us, would he? He was a hero, a general, he wouldn’t send his comrades into war on a lie now would he?
Except all that turned out to be bullshit too, and Colin Powell was either a dupe of staggering proportions or he was the kind of Soldier who would fuck his buddy right in the ass without so much as a reach-around and I’ll leave it up to you to figure which one is worse.
But by the time we figured out we’d been ass-raped by Colin Powell, we were shoulder deep in Iraq, Baghdad was burning, Iraq’s army had thrown down their weapons and taken off their uniforms and had melted into the population, Saddam had vanished and his sons were dead, and the President of the United States had already declared victory from the deck of an American aircraft carrier.
And so, the objective became … what?
Hearts and minds and freedom and democracy and nation building and magic bunnies who fart sunshine and rainbows.
Unfortunately, it turns out we’re real good at the blowing shit up part, not so good at the magic bunnies part.
Which in retrospect, shouldn’t be all that surprising – given that in order to build a civilization it helps if you actually have some vague familiarity with the people involved.  Needless to say, we didn’t. And we didn’t care. To America, they were all little brown towelheads, sand niggers, raggedy-assed camel jockeys who ought to be grateful to America for burning down their shitty country.  Sunni? Shia? Turkman? Baathists? What’s that? What do you mean they hate each other? They’re all Muslims aren’t they? They’re all Aayrabs, right? What do you mean they hate each other? And it all fell apart, disintegrating into insurgency and murder and bloody civil war – just exactly as anybody who actually knew something about the region and its people and its history could have told you it would.  We lost less than a hundred soldiers in the actual war, the “peace” cost us nearly 5000 more.  And the Iraqis? Who the hell knows? A hundred thousand? A million? It’s impossible to tell.
And it turns out that freedom and democracy and magic flying bunnies were as elusive as Iraq’s supposed WMDs.
So, what was it again that we were fighting for?
They had no idea what we were fighting for, those saber-rattling Chicken Hawks, the cowardly connected wealthy weasels who’d managed to avoid serving in their own war, who kept their children out of uniform, but just couldn’t wait to send us into one of their own making. They sent us off with parades and marching bands and cheering crowds … and brought the bodies home in secret, hidden away from the TV cameras and the public.
They had no plan and no idea what we were dying for, but they assured us what the war wasn’t  about – it wasn’t about religion.
Oh no, sir, we weren’t fighting to eradicate Muslims, it wasn’t about Islam.
The Evangelical Christian religious extremists who started this war told us it wasn’t about religion.
Heh heh, riiiiiight. And Vietnam was really about containing communism. Sure.
Maybe they should have had Colin Powell tell that wopper to the UN, but he’d quit by then and was suddenly as invisible to America as those flag draped metal boxes arriving at Dover Air Force base in the middle of the night.
Americans who a few years before had been proudly waving their little flags as Johnny marched off to war were suddenly all shifty-eyed, they slapped a $5 dollar made in China magnet on the bumper of their giant gas-sucking SUVs, Support Our Troops, and with sardonically raised eyebrows complained to each other over the pumps about the immorality of a war fought for oil.
But that wasn’t true either, was it?
Iraq’s oil fields, the ones we fought and died to preserve on orders from the White House, the off-shore terminals the SEALs and the GROM risked their lives to save on that night back in 2003, the precious Iraqi oil that was going to pay for the war and pay to rebuild the country we’d blown up, well, that oil is nowhere to be found today, is it?
So, tell me again, what exactly is it that’s on the “cusp of vanishing?”
I mean it sure isn’t peace.
It’s not freedom for the Iraqi people, despite the war’s idiotic name.
It sure isn’t regional stability.
It’s not the end of terrorism or the near universal hatred of America in the Middle East.
And now that Halliburton and KBR and Blackwater and Dick Cheney have made their billions and cashed out, it isn’t even about long-term economic investments and American business.
Hell, it’s not even about cheap gas.
So, go on, enlighten me. Because even though I was there, I’ve got no goddamned idea what it is that we’ve lost in Iraq beyond the 4,487 men and women we shipped home in metal boxes, beyond the 32,223 wounded and maimed, beyond the trillions of dollars we spent in our rage and our drive for revenge and our lust for blood.
Today, John McCain and Mitt Romney and the rest of the conservative war machine are railing against the President.
McCain stirred from the yellow fog of his bamboo cage and proclaimed in his best Old Man Yelling At Clouds voice, “We won Iraq! Obama lost it!”
Really Johnny Walnuts? Tell me, what did we win? And what have we lost? Please be specific, because I’d really like to know.
We no more “won” Iraq than McCain’s own father “won” Vietnam.
McCain claims he “predicted” the sectarian violence now tearing Iraq apart. Really? Where the hell was clairvoyant John McCain back in 2003 when he voted along with the rest of them to send us into war? And later, where was his great predictive ability when Iraq began tearing itself apart? I guess he was at a Dixie Chicks concert, he must have been out in the lobby ordering a plate of Freedom Fries when his pal George W. Bush let Iraq disintegrate into civil war.
And so here we are.
The same old motley cast of characters, the warhawks and the chickenhawks and the billionaires and the simple-minded saber-rattlers and the same old hate-filled pundits, they just can’t wait to jump back into Iraq.
Mitt Romney, John McCain, one who never served and one who damned well ought to know better, men who both wanted to be President of the United States and who both lost to Barack Obama, they just can’t wait to send other people’s kids back into the meat grinder.
Here’s my question.
Why?
Why, John McCain?
Why, Mitt Romney?
Why, conservatives?
This time you fuckers goddamned well tell me why.
What’s the goal? What’s the objective? Is it to end terrorism? Is it to enforce peace at the muzzle of a gun? Is it it to make defense contractors rich? Is it for jobs? Or is it for magic flying bunnies who shoot rainbows and cheap gasoline out of their little assholes to the sound of Yankee Doodle Dandy?
Or, or, is it just because you hate Barack Obama?
That’s it, isn’t it?
It is.
You sons of bitches one and all, you simpering capering madmen, this time at least have the courage to face the cameras, to look into America’s eyes, and tell them that their sons and daughters will be dying because you John McCain, because you Mitt Romney, because you Dick Cheney, because you Donald Rumsfeld, because you George W. Bush you lying bastard, because you conservatives hate Barack Obama…and for no other reason.
Go on, tell us, go on. Wave your little flags and beat your fleshy chests, roll out the marching bands and tell us just how many more American soldiers should die. Go on, put a number on it. Ten? A hundred? Fifty four thousand? How many of us have to die? How many more bodies will it take to satiate your mindless hunger for blood and revenge? How many more American lives are worth your insane hatred of the president? How many? How much further into debt should we drive our nation, another trillion dollars? Two? Ten? A hundred? Put a price on it you insane sons of bitches, go on, give me a number, write me a check. Tell me how much you’re willing to pay, show me the goddamned money. How many more years? How many? One? Five? Another decade? Fifty? What is it? Don’t wave your hands and make some vague prognostication, give me a number, how many lives, how much money, how many years? You look us in the eye and you fucking tell us.
I’ll tell you what, let’s go back to Iraq.
Oh, yes, let us do that.
I’ll dig out my uniform and strap on my pistol and gird up my sword and ride into battle yet again.
Just so long as Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush, Rush Limbaugh, Anne Coulter, Glenn Beck, Michael Savage, Paul Ryan, Sarah Palin, Rick Perry, and every single one of those powdered, Botoxed talking heads at Fox News are in the vanguard. That’s right, you cowards, you put on a uniform and you lead the charge this time around. The Koch brothers and Mitt Romney can pay for it, every goddamned penny, we’ll bleed them until they’re dry and then we’ll pull the gold fillings from their teeth to pay for it right along with the rest of their Wall Street cronies. You fuckers got rich off the last one, you can damned well pay for this one. And when you run out of money, we’ll take your blood, fair’s fair.
Strap John McCain into the cockpit of an A-4 Skyhawk and let him fly air cover.
If he gets himself shot down and taken prisoner again, well, you know what? Fuck him, leave him to the enemy because frankly his hate and bile and raging insanity have done more damage to this country than Bowe Bergdahl ever did.
The terrorists can keep him.
 
Peace love and understanding tell me

personalfinance,Extra payment on mortgage = Investing in (non-breakable) CD,"One of the most common questions in personal finance is ""Should I make extra payment on mortgage?"" Of course, every situation is different. But here's a simple way to answer this question personally. 

Making extra payment on mortgage has the same effect as investing in a (non-puttable or non-breakable) CD. The effects on the cashflow are exactly the same between the two, even accounting for the tax implications. If you don't understand this, here's the explanation.

Suppose you have a $100k 30-yr 4% mortgage but expect to pay it off in 5 years not 30 years. This could be due to selling the house in 5 years, when you payoff the mortgage from sales proceeds. In fact, most borrowers don't hold the mortgage for the entire term.

Let's compare the cashflows between the following 2 scenarios: 

a. making $10k extra payment on mortgage today.

b. investing $10k in a hypothetical 5-yr 4% non-breakable CD today.

Today, in both cases, you pay $10k. Same negative $10k cash flow for both a and b.

At the end of 5 years, your mortgage balance becomes $78,237.55. On the other hand, if you don't make the $10k extra payment today, the mortgage balance in 5 years will be $90,447.51 (= $12,209.97 higher). In short, by making $10k extra payment today, you pay $12,209.97 less to pay off the mortgage in 5 years. So your CF in 5 years (when you pay off the mortgage) will increase by $12,209.97. 

Instead, if you invest $10k in a 5-yr 4% CD today, at the maturity in 5 years, the CD balance will become $10k * (1 + 4%/12) ^ (5*12) = $12,209.97, which you can withdraw. Your CF will increase by $12,209.97. Same cash flow effect as making extra payment above.

Finally, how about the tax effects? Suppose you are itemizing the deduction, and you pay income tax on the interest income. Assume a 25% bracket.

By making extra $10k payment, your interest payment decreases, your tax savings will decrease and you have to pay higher tax. How much more? If you don't make extra payment, your tax saving in year 1 is about $100k* 4% interest * 25% tax = $1000 (to be exact $991.99 due to monthly payments). If you make $10k extra payment, your tax saving in year 1 is about ($100k-$10k) * 4% * 25 = $900 (to be exact, $890.13). Your income tax increases by $991.99 - $890.13 = $101.85. In other words, your cash flow in year 1 decreases by $101.85.

Instead, if you invest $10k in a 5-yr 4% CD, your interest income tax in year 1 is about $10k * 4% * 25% = $100 ($101.85 to be exact due to monthly compounding). Again, your cash flow in year 1 decreases by $101.85, same as above. 

You can also do the math for year 2, 3, etc. The additional tax liabilities for making extra payment and investing in a CD are exactly the same.

In conclusion, making extra payment on a 4% mortgage has the same effect as investing the same amount in a 4% CD. 

What does this imply?

Instead of weighing the pros/cons of making extra payment on mortgage, imagine investing in a ""hypothetical"" CD. If such CD exists (of course in real life, CD rates are much lower than mortgage rates but we are imagining a hypothetical CD), will you invest in this CD? If yes, then making extra principal payment is the right decision for you. If not, then don't make extra payments. To sum, if you are willing to invest $X in a non-breakable CD with the same interest rate as your mortgage rate for the same length that you expect to hold the mortgage, then making $X extra payment on your mortgage is the right decision.

Of course, not everybody will have the same decision. But at least, it will be easier for you to make the decision because you are now comparing a CD investment (instead of wondering about the effect of extra payment on interest savings and tax increase) with an alternative investment such as stock investment.

How about liquidity? In real life, you can liquidate regular CDs after paying the penalty. On the other hand, it's hard to liquidate home equity. So if you are hypothesizing a regular CD instead of the above non-breakable CD, lower the interest rate by how much rate you are willing to sacrifice for liquidity (highly subjective) for comparison.",finance,1403102823

personalfinance,Retirement savings questions (TSP),"My husband and I have been saving 15% for retirement. We both make generally the same amount (he makes $27 an hour I make $28). I recently graduated and now have a job with the federal government. His employer puts a percentage into his retirement regardless of his contributions. The government matches 5% of mine. The bulk of our retirement funds are in my husband's John Hancock account which are currently valued at $130k. I am just starting out so I have 10K in a TSP from the past 6 months with rolling over a couple of tiny 401Ks over. 


For what it's worth. We are 32. My earnings will go up significantly in the next few years, his will probably stay pretty much on par for the course (1-5% raises every year). We don't actually plan on retiring that early. We both enjoy working. If we are in good health I plan on working until I am 70 then probably continuing to volunteer/work in some capacity. My husband may retire earlier but he would still be working part time in some way. He is very talented and has a lot of work from home potential. Oh also I plan on staying with the government for my career and I also have a pension through them.


I also know if someone looks at my old posts we have a significant amount of low interest student loan debt (4.85 and below) which is our only debt other than our mortgage. We are also working on aggressively paying that down in addition to saving (75K now down from 85k in January). We are happy with splitting our extra money between savings and paying off student loan debt.


I have been an avid reader of PF for about 6 months and I have learned a ton. But I am still pretty much ""I don't know what I am doing"" as far as investments. Here are my questions. Thank you very much in advance for your input!


1. Should we save more with my TSP and drop down his contributions. Since I know his fees are higher (not sure of the actual percentage but from a statement when the account was $120k in Dec of last year the fees were $60 for the quarter). His account has done well for us 16.55% since inception 10 years ago. What would your recommendations for this be?


2. What are your recommendations for me to distribute my contributions between the funds in my TSP. We like higher risk right now. Currently I have 50% between I fund and 50% in S funds. I split that between my Roth 401K and my traditional 401K.  Or should I just pick a Lifecycle fund that's up there (like 2050?).


3. We have a small business we would also like to start contributing 15% of it's earnings into a fund (probably about $300 a month). Should we continue trying to max out my TSP or should we open a Vanguard Roth IRA and max that out every year? 

Thank you all very much in advance.",finance,1403109095

I am 25 years old, working a few different low paying jobs. 

I have 2 Sallie Mae student loans, a private one for around 400 and a Federal one for 500. I make about 800 a month, more in the summer. (edit: totaling to 900 per month)

I applied to have the federal one lowered through their ""Pay as you earn"" program, which can lower it substantially, I am sure it will cripple me in the future, but I need to live now. I am trying to move in  than marry my girlfriend of 8 years, soon.



To the questions I guess, I wanted to give a little background. 

I have a discover card that I never have really used since college. I do not know if Discover is any good for what I want to do. My plan is to either pay the other loan monthly on a card, or out of my pocket and pay for everything else in every day life with a credit card, to build good credit. 

Which of these paths do you think would be better and if Discover is no good, what kind of card should I apply for.

personalfinance,"Very fortunate recent graduate, considering implications of CPO BMW purchase","I recently graduated from college. I have zero debt. I had full ride scholarships (merit) because I went to lesser known schools when I could have gone to top schools.  I also worked for my whole college career, sometimes I had two engineering internships at the same time, so I could have weeks during the school year where I made good money. I also had some pretty good summer internships. This means I graduated with about $45k in assets ($5k roth, $40k savings account).  I didn't do much investing, that was probably a mistake. In college I had a cheap car, cheap rent, and I didn't buy a lot of stuff, but I did spend a lot of money on eating out. 

I also got a pretty good job in part because I had a ton of work experience, did well in school and had a bunch of research, and I majored in a lucrative field. 

My incomes are as below:
1) After tax take home pay: $5300

2) 401K Contributions (mine and employer included): $1600 (I'm at the max contribution).

3) Performance Bonus (nominal, if its lower I may not have a job, it can be higher)  and Stock (Stock, not options) divided by 12 over the year: $1000 (after tax). 

Total Income: $7900 a month after tax. 

Total Monthly Spending Budget
Note: All expenses include taxes and some are ""budgets"" i.e. I spend no more then that amount. 

1) Rent and all Utilities: $1050 (this is with room mates, the area where I live subsidized university housing is $950 a month). I could have had cheaper rent if I lived farther away from work.

2) Phone: $46 a month 

3) Netflix/Spotify: $20 a month

4) Car Gas: $100 a month

5) Car Insurance for a BMW I was quoted $140 a month. This can be less depending on the car. 2011 BMW was about $25 more a month then a 2011 civic.

6) Travel: $300. I visit a friend or a family once per month. 

7) Clothes: $50

8) Misc Expenses: $400 (depends on month, this is for gifts, new electronics, video games etc). I have a yearly budget of $4800 and since these expenses are not required I won't spend a dime after that.

9) Renters Insurance: $15 per month (Required by contract) 

10) Entertainment: $200 a month (Bars, movies, concerts etc). 

11) Food: $500 a month (includes eating out). 

This means my monthly expenses are: $2800 a month. My ""required"" monthly expenses are about $1900 a month (minus travel, misc expenses, and entertainment. Obviously I could eat out less too and cut that down to like $1600 or so). So a six month emergency fund would be $12,000. My total savings is about $5100 a month. 

My previous vehicle is under my parents name. It is a 20 year old Japanese car that is dented, scratched, rusted, (one head light is taped on), the head lights are shorted to the speakers (no music at night), there is no longer any suspension (its been gone for 2 years), and it probably needs new brakes. There are a bunch of other minor problems, the power locks don't work on one side, the antenna is gone etc. The car also makes funny noises when you turn the steering wheel too hard and when you drive it. I would guess to repair it would cost about $2K to $3k. I would also need to ship it to my current location which is about $1K. My parents would gift me the vehicle if I wanted it, but they think I should get a new car. The car was great in college though, the ""core"" of the car was reliable (engine, transmission etc). Also the car's been in my family for 20 years so I have sentimental attachment to it. It also just got too damaged when somebody hit and ran, compressing the hood, putting two giant scratches through it, and also knocking out a head light. 

I'm kind of comparing two options here. Option A is I get a fully loaded 2011 civic with about 50k miles on it for $15K after tax. Option B is I get a CPO BMW 3 series with 20k miles on it for about $25k to $30k (after taxes). The civic has no warranty, the BMW I was looking at was made in 2012 so it has 2 years of ""zero maintenance"" and two more years of CPO warranty. I really like nice cars. Like I've been drawing cars and knew a lot about them since I was 5 years old. I also like the e90 BMW, the straight six engine, and the exterior design. I also love driving the BMW. I would also consider a WRX, but I kind of like some luxury which is why I was going BMW. My original plan was to keep my current car for six months to 2 years longer and then get a new car. However....since the suspension repair was $900 I didn't want to buy that and I didn't want to drive 25 hours with no suspension in a car of questionable reliability.  Now I'm debating a lot between a loaded civic and a BMW. My personal justification is I had money saved up for a trip to Europe, but I decided to hang out with my college friends and my family instead, and that I started working a month before a lot of other new hires at my place of work. So that adds about $10k to my savings. 

Anyways I know buying an expensive car is a bad idea from a finance decision. I'm just trying to gauge how bad of an idea it is. I'm keeping the BMW under 25% of my gross pre-tax income. I can buy the car straight cash (however this would leave me with just an emergency fund, and it might be too low to be an emergency fund), but with a CPO BMW specifically, they were offering me 3% interest through a "" new college grad"" type of deal, so I could build credit, in which case I was considering a $5k to $10k loan to build credit. I would have preferred to buy the BMW six months from now with $30k more in savings, but that didn't work out. If I got a civic I feel like I'd be wanting to upgrade to the BMW soon. 

For short term goals, I would like to buy a condo and rent it out to other people (with me living in one of the rooms) after 3 years. This would cut rent out of my budget. For long term goals, I would like to save $1million in 13 years. I'm in my early to mid 20s. With a 5% interest rate I exceed this goal with $5100 a month in savings. I would also like to be financially independent. So from that end it seems like I'm on track even if I buy a BMW. My heart says yes, but my brain is wary. Basically I'm trying to gauge the magnitude of my stupidity if I buy a CPO BMW.",finance,1403113536

1. Student Loans defaulted with Uncle being cosigner(he is getting phone calls and for this to stop they say I need to at least pay my loan interest monthly which is a whooping $750).

2. I have poor credit and need a secured credit card to start to establish credit which is a upfront cost of $350-$400 or less depending on what I can get accepted for.

3. I owe back state/fed taxes and have not filed for two years i should have. I need to hire a tax professional to help me here and I believe this is probably my #1 priority at the moment but I'm not sure how much of my monthly income I should be devoting to this one debt which is costly. I owe probably $10k+ in back taxes when I worked as a contractor in my early 20's and no one cared to explain what I was getting my self in to.

4. I have around $4,000 in collections at the moment which I need to start hacking away at slowly with any money left over.

5. My required monthly bills are low. Car Insurance $95/month Phone/text/data $60/month, Gas $80, Food $200/month (if i want to eat healthy)

Last month I was notified that my loans are being deferred until 06/28/2017 and I have no idea why. So my question is should I only pay on the unsubsidized and throw as much I can at those right now? Since I am not in school, could they undefer everything before 2017 out of the blue? The other thing is that my total balance is not really decreasing despite paying extra every month and an extra $1000 from my tax refund. I had a little less than 41k when I graduated last May and I've put at least $6000 towards these loans so I don't understand.

I know the Personal Loan will be the first to go since that interest rate is OUTRAGEOUS. I had to take it out as I needed a new dryer and a new lawn mower and to cover a tuition payment since there was communication error with me and my school. 

So really, my question is should I apply the VA check to the student loans or should I knock down my mortgage or car payment? What order should I do this? I'm struggling to see which one will be the most beneficial.",finance,1403116538

litecoin,These ASIC manufacturers..... are pretty shady.,"I ordered my week 4 ASIC miner from Gawminers.com - their website explicitly states that if their orders do NOT ship by the 16th they will compensate the user. Before, it said they will get miners up for you.

My order finally shipped on the 18th (today) which means it will probably not arrive until next week instead of THIS week. I attempted to contact Gawminers several times, to no avail. All I got was tech supports who promised called backs from supervisors. One even told me that because of the time zone difference - there was NO DELAY. Apparently China is ahead of the US by 48 hours. Interesting. I told them several times I need to speak to a supervisor given the time sensitive nature of mining, and all the tech supports said the supervisors aren't in - they are busy running the company from ""the office""

First of all, this company is a fucking joke. Nothing but incompetence. NONE of their week 4 orders are going to make it in time. To top it off, they don't have a fully staffed support site. What in the FUCK.
 
We know they are making a killing, but they are nickle and diming users. BEWARE OF GAWMINERS. This first generation of ASIC chips made by these companies are shady first-to-the-market money grabbers. We need reputable sellers to come out, but GAWMINERS is not one of them.

personalfinance,Graduate student finance advice!,"Hi Guys:

I'm looking for a little personal finance advice. I'm currently a second year MD/PhD candidate and I make $29,100 pretax a year from my stipend. My tuition, benefits etc. are all paid for by the school and will be paid until I graduate in ~5-6 years. Thus, I have no significant debt to incur in the future, my income is very stable and will likely be stable during residency and as a physician. I just hit a milestone of paying off all of my credit card debt but now I need a little help on where to go from here.

Here's my current breakdown:

* Monthly Income	$2425

* Set-aside for quarterly tax payments $250

* Rent/Utilities $479

* Food	$400 (this is the max budgeted including dining out, but often is much less)

* Car Payment $306

* Car and Renter's Insurance	$129.41

* Cell Phone	$94.74

* Total left at end of month: $766

Current checking and savings balance: 

* $12,115 (this includes my emergency fund, which I keep at around $10,000, plus a $1000-2000 buffer in my checking account)

Debts:

* Student loans from undergrad: $49,521 (interest rates from 4-6%)

* Car loan: ~$17,500 (interest rate ~5%)

* Credit cards: Zero!

My student loans are currently in deferment for being in school and my car payment is my largest monthly debt payment. Until now, all my extra money was going to my credit cards, but now that those are tackled, I'm not sure where to put my money. I feel secure with my emergency fund and buffer given the stability of my income. So, should I be A) paying off my car loan which is in repayment right now, B) paying off my largest debt which is my student loans, but with the caveat that they will be eligible for IBR and possible loan forgiveness in residency, C) investing my money and potentially earning &gt;5% or D) some other options?

I should also say that I'm limited in any tax advantage retirement accounts since the IRS does not count my income as ""earned"" and I do not have any 401K options.",finance,1403118712

2)	What company would be best to consolidate Sallie Mae Private Loans? Wells Fargo and Sofi... there's only five main companies right?  Any company you wouldn't recommend? 

3)	When I consolidate, do I get more fees associated with consolidating? 

4)	How long does the consolidation process take?

5)	Can I consolidate Revenue Corp. and the Department of Education Loans, or do I have to consolidate them separately?

6)	Do I have to get General Revenue Corp out of default in order to consolidate? I currently pay 300 a month.  Won’t they ask for more a month if I bring them out of default? 

7)	Is there any way to consolidate EVERYTHING?  Or do private loans always need to stay separate?

8)	Do you automatically get a better interest rate after consolidation or do I have to negotiate one?

9)	For Sallie Mae loans, am I stuck with that God awful interest rate?  Is there ANYTHING I can do?

personalfinance,Restructuring 4 Years of Credit Card Debt,"Hi all,

I graduated from college this year with ~$8000 of credit card debt. Despite having a credit score of &gt;700, I'm dealing with really high APR's (~20%). 

I'm starting a stable job in NYC in August. I'll be making $65,000 with a $5000 signing bonus, and living at home for the first 5 months. I had an internship with this company last summer, and I know that with Federal, social security, medicare, state, and local, I'll only be bringing home about 65% of that $65,000, which leaves me with roughly $3500/mo. 

My current plan is to pay off most of the debt, maybe ~$7000 by the time I move out. I anticipate on spending about $1000/mo on personal. This means that I'll be paying ~$1500/mo on debt, leaving me with only $1000/mo in savings. I would really like to have ~$10,000 saved up by the time I move out so that I can better negotiate with landlords in NYC (with no guarantor, I'll have to put up a few months rent at lease signing). 

Here's my question, is there any easy way of restructuring this debt to more favorable terms with a bank? Paying it off in the long run is really the most attractive option for me, as this job has huge, and guaranteed, income potential. This is also why I'm insisting on spending so much on personal.

TLDR:
*$1250/mo in expenses
*$3500/mo pay
*$5000 starting bonus
*$8000 in credit card debt with high APR
Can I restructure this debt through a bank?

Edit: I'll be contributing about $240/mo to my parents for letting me stay at home.
Edit 2: I have well over double the 8k in my combined credit limit. Keeping a balance will not hurt my credit, and I'm planning on closing 2 of my 5 cards after I pay it down.",finance,1403123107
Forex,USDJPY Trading the tick chart,"I've been trading a basic support/resistance break and retest strategy for some time now on the hourly time frame, though as of lately with trades becoming fewer and further between I started applying the same methodology to a much lower time frame, specifically tick charts. 

Today I'd focused on USDJPY - reason being the overnight Asian session (I'm UK based) showed strength and a decent up move breaking through some solid resistance on the daily/hourly. So I initially began trying to build a long position. Throughout the morning it appeared price was forming a bull flag and formed some good support at the Asian session highs which was also the 50% retracement of the move, once the level broke I cut and reversed on the retest of that level. Caught the move down and looked to load up - where I admit it got a bit messy, I then wasn't sure if we'd have made the low of the day which came in with the Asian session lows, I flipped back to long before scratching the idea and took a small loss - not looking to hold further coming into FOMC. Here's how it looks: http://i.imgur.com/EWefwSx.jpg

Anyway, here's my best play scenario I did after (hopefully clears it up a bit): http://i.imgur.com/88Ygxpc.jpg I thought I'd share my thinking process going through the day both in how I traded vs what how I could of improved it. 

What I do like about these tick charts is the great risk:reward opportunity - even after candle confirmation, stops can be kept real tight (i.e other side of levels, trailing along channels etc.). I thought I'd share it and thoughts and criticism welcome.",finance,1403123376

personalfinance,"Paying off last semester's debt, and taking a year off of school. Need some help balancing.","So, i'm in a bit of a confusing time.

I have just finished my second year of college, got my first ""real"" full-time job, and moved into my first apartment. with everything being new to me, i'm in need of some advice on how to balance my debts.

to cut it shoort, I found out my parent's didn't actually save up as much as they told me when I asked them about college, and now they have dumped the entire debt to me just as i end my semester.

the total due now is roughly 6,000 for the last year of school that I just completed. the school is saying that as long as i pay some money each month, there won't be any need to bring in any outside parties, and i won't have to pay interest or late fees. 

this sounds good to me because that gives me a good length of time to pay this off. 

the reason i have time is that i am not attending college for at least a year now. i am taking some time off to think about how i want to finish school, and devoting my time towards a new full time job so that i can live in my apartment.

i just started working at Amazon, and after a year there, they will help fund my tuition, about 90% of it by my investication. so i decided that i will take a year off of school and use those benifits when they come around. 

since i am taking a year off of school, i will soon have to start repaying federal loans until i become a full or part time student again, as they only allow 6 months off of school before repayment starts being enforced.

i only make roughly 22,000 a year at amazon (average estimate for a full time employee. i may be making slightly more because i will be doing a lot of overtime in my position.)

my main problem is: how can i manage paying for rent, food, current due for last school year, and the upcomming student loan repayment?

**here is my averages for reference**

* rent: 385 / month
* current owe on last school year: 6150, payments are flexible as long as i pay comsistantly: no interest or penalties.
* current loan amount to repay: 12,800 + standard federal interest rate.
* Average monthly **income** : 1760 (flat 40hrs, no overtime included)
* Best case monthly **income** : 2420 (overtime added, current schedule)
* low end monthly **income** : 1548 (lowest amount of hours available by contract. unlikely outcome)


the federal loan will start seeking repayment in november, and i can't figure out what the monthly cost will be on that loan because i havent been able to contact the loan holder.


TL:DR  how should i go about balancing this, and what tips might anyone have for me about making this as easy as possible. i'm really new to this ""adult world"" and i just don't want to fuck it up, so i'm attempting to do as much as i can right now, rather than wait untill they come hunting me.",finance,1403137659
personalfinance,Graduate School Question: Federal Loans vs. Cashing Out Investments?,"I'm starting graduate school this fall in NYC and I'm looking for some advice on how much I should take out in loans. It's a one year program and the tuition/ students fees are $45,000. I hoping to spend around $20,000 on living expenses/rent (I'm from out of state, so I'm not sure how realistic this is for New York). I have $47,000 in investments (mostly mutual funds) and I plan to work part time while studying, as well as taking up any fellowship/scholarship opportunities that I can.
I've been approved for $49,500 in federal loans/work study. Here the breakdown:


Cost of School + Living Expenses:
~$65,000


Assets:
$47,000


Potential Loans:
Federal Direct Unsubsidized (6.421% interest) - $20,500
Federal Perkins (5.0%) - $6,000

Other:
Work Study - $3,000

Current Debt:
$0

Based on this, should I accept the full amount in loans or should I cash out all/some my investments to pay tuition?

I should also mention that I'll most likely qualify for the loan forgiveness program since I plan to work in public service when I graduate.

Please forgive me if I am posting in the wrong place.  

I'm in a situation where my husband and I are about to buy our first home.  My uncle has closed his IRA (he will be 70 next month--so he just took it out all in a lump sum) and since he himself does not need the money, he has decided to give it to us to put towards a down payment. He already has paid both the NYS and federal tax on the money he took out. (approx 170k)

He put the money into his savings account which is in his and my names. (8 years ago his wife/my aunt passed away and my name has been on there since)

My question is, will he have to pay a gift tax?  From the research I've done, could this be considered part of the lifetime gift exemption? If this is true, will he have to file Form 709 and what should he do regarding NYS?

personalfinance,How do I deal with wife's private student loans (not in FAQ)? They come out of deferment before she graduates. Any advice? Thanks!,"Like the title says, my wife has private loans from Chase.  They're five separate loans right now with fixed interest rates.  4 of them are 3.3-3.88%, one is at 7.5% and the total comes to around $50k.  They've been accruing interest, but it won't be capitalized until they come out of deferment.

She's also a PhD student with free tuition and a stipend (awesome!) but Chase says all Grad School = two years max, and she has five more years to go (not awesome).  Each loan will come out of deferment in the order it was taken out, starting next February.  So our monthly income will remain constant, but we'll have a new loan payment added every year for the next four years.  They project that the total repayment for all five will be near $400/month.  This basically prevents us from buying a house or getting a car.

Then her Federal loans will come out of deferment after she graduates.  Those are another $20k or so.

When she graduates and gets a job, we'll be able to pay them without too much of a problem.  Right now on my salary and her stipend we cover our bills with a little left over, but when these need to be repaid, we'll be stressing our budget.

What can we do?  I can't find anything online about Chase loans, and I want to know if there are options before I discuss consolidation and other options with Chase.

personalfinance,Paying more than 15% on a large student loan. Should I reduce my payments?,"Here's the situation:

* Yearly income: $65,000.
* Fifteen percent of that is about $812/month.
* Current student loan payments are $1,100.
* Student loan is $152,000, with principal and interest currently accrued. It's made up of three separate loans (Direct subsidized, direct unsubsidized, and Grad Plus), with interest rates of 6.8%, 6.8%, and 7.9%, respectively.
* My current understanding of the law regarding student loans is that lenders cannot require you to pay more than 15% at a time. On top of that, if you make consistent payments over 20 years, the rest is forgiven. Correct me if this is wrong.

My living situation is such that I can make the payments as they become due, but I'm not saving much money after that. My take home pay is only about $3,400/month after taxes, about $2,100 of which is going to rent and student loans. (I have no other debt, and bills are minimal after that point.)

I'm thinking that, if I can reduce my payments, I can make them consistently at $812/month, saving an extra ~$300/month. It may not be paid off by the 20 year mark, but if I don't have to make payments after that time, I don't exactly want to throw that money into the hole.

personalfinance,Is having an unsubsidized loan accrue interest while I'm in school worth having a lower interest rate?,"Hey there pf. sorry to bother yall. been lurking for a bit. Had to make an account just for this. 

So my college tuition is mostly covered by merit and need based grants, but I am still taking out 5500 in loans, 3500 in subsidized loans(3.86% interest paid while im in college), 2000 perkins loans(5% interest paid by school while im in college). I was offered unsubsidized but I will be in school for a while and will likely not be able to pay off the monthly interest so I didnt want it accruing, and my family can afford to pay even without them.

However according to the new law that ties student interest rates are determined by the 10 year yield on a treasury bill sale. Those have been falsely kept low and will be increasing. Everywhere I have been reading says that it will go up approximately .8% per year, capping at 8.25 Undergraduate stafford, 9.5 graduate stafford, and 10.5 grad plus loans.

So since the rates will be going up how do I figure out if it is worth it to take the loans, and save the money my family has to pay for college in future years when loans are a higher percentage, but doing so at the accrueing of interest on those unsub loans while I am in college.

If it changes anything I will be going to college for six years currently. 5 will be counted as undergrad and the last 1 will be counted as grad school.

Bitcoin,The Great US Marshal Bitcoin Auction,"The 29,656 bitcoins being auctioned by the US Marshals on June 27 will sell for a **premium** over the going market rate of bitcoins at that time.


To understand why, you must think in terms of Game Theory. There are 3 possible scenarios which can theoretically occur:


1) The bitcoins sell for **less** than the market rate.


2) The bitcoins sell at **exactly** the market rate.


3) The bitcoins sell for **more** than the market rate.


Imagine you are a bidder in this auction. If you believe you have a chance to acquire the bitcoins at **below** the market rate (**Scenario #1**) then rationally that is what you would bid. This would create an immediate arbitrage opportunity; you acquire an asset at a discount relative to the market at large and are thus able to “flip it” for an immediate, riskless profit. Furthermore, selling or dumping such a volume on the exchanges all-at-once would negatively impact the price^1 (likely in a significant way, as the markets are “waiting to see” what will happen regarding this auction and the bitcoins involved), so you would not only be able to make a profit as you arbitraged, but any bitcoins you sold you would shortly be able to acquire right back at cheaper prices as the markets overreacted and dropped too far (albeit temporarily). In other words, without assuming any risk, you would be capable of netting fiat profit and acquiring a massive stake in Bitcoin simultaneously.

Arbitrage is the holy grail in finance. Whenever you can, you do, and you do it as much and as hard as possible. This means that the US Marshal auction is one of the most attractive opportunities possible, and savvy investors are not going to overlook this. The only problem with arbitrage is that as soon as others become aware of the same opportunity, the gap closes; the valuation of the asset equalizes because **those who can exploit the gap do**. What this means is that the bitcoins effectively **cannot** be sold at a price significantly below market rate^2, because each investor is aware of the opportunity; anyone trying to bid 10% below-market-price is going to be beaten by the investor who is willing to bid 5% below-market-price; they, in turn, will be beat by someone willing to accept even smaller margins, etc, until suddenly we’re at **Scenario #2**: the bitcoins being auctioned at exactly the market rate. 

Now, understand that anyone who has deposited $200,000 merely for the opportunity to bid on these coins *actually want the coins*; otherwise, they are pointlessly and wastefully tying up capital that can be used or leveraged elsewhere. Also understand that they realize all of what I have explained above, and they know that each other serious bidder realizes the same. Therefore, in order to stand any true chance at acquiring the coins, they would actually have to bid **above** the market rate (**Scenario #3**) to out-bid the competitors.

...

At this point, it is natural to ask: “why pay a premium for bitcoins when you can buy them for cheaper on the exchanges directly?” and at first glance this appears to be a perfectly valid question. 

First off, you cannot buy 29,656 bitcoins on the open market without a serious amount of [slippage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) occurring; put simply, if you place a market buy order that large, you’re going to drive the price up **a lot** and the price you ultimately pay for the coins is going to be far more than what the market rate was before you started buying. There simply isn’t that enough volume (cumulatively, across all exchanges^3) to handle an immediate buy-order this large; “whales” who want to acquire a lot of bitcoins are forced to (try to) contact large holders of bitcoins off-exchanges^4 or buy in small increments over a long period of time^5. So buying at a slight premium immediately is actually rational, especially if you expect the price of the asset to increase in the future (as anyone interested in bidding in this auction surely does).


Secondly, the United States Federal Government is the most trusted seller that exists. Under no other circumstances can you, as a buyer, assume less risk in terms of seller reputation. The very act of moving funds onto an exchange is one of the riskiest parts of buying Bitcoin^6. This plays a role in asset-pricing; any reduction in risk will have a positive impact on asset valuation.

And finally, anyone who *does* buy the coins at a rate higher than market-value will have the ability to then publicize the details of their acquisition, including the settlement price^7. Once this is done, the information would influence the exchange rate; buyers and sellers would realize “there’s more demand, at higher prices, than we initially believed” and the price would be inexorably driven upwards^8. This would, of course, increase the value of their recently-acquired stake. Once again, the markets of Bitcoin tend to overreact when it comes to things like this, and combined with the recent ascension and re-entry into a bull-market, it is highly likely that a sudden price increase, combined with the media exposure that this auction will bring about (especially if the final bid is **above** the current price!) will trigger the next Bitcoin bubble that everyone^9 has been expecting. If this does kickstart a bubble, the entity who bought all the coins at a slight market premium would suddenly have proven to have made a very intelligent investment decision as their holdings multiply in value rapidly. 

So what should we rationally do, now that we understand all of the above? We should do everything we can to increase the price of a bitcoin in the meantime; the higher the market-price at the time of auction, the higher the “price floor” we will have set, and the higher the bids will have to be to win the coins. Any price increase in the meantime will compound with the other effects mentioned above, helping to increase media exposure and public interest, thus also helping to trigger a bubble if one can indeed be triggered at this time. So *do not sell your coins* and if you were thinking about buying any more (and if you can safely do so without overexposing yourself to risk) then *buy, buy, buy* during this next week^10. Now very well may be the last opportunity to get bitcoins this cheaply.

**TL;DR: These coins are going to be sold above market-price. It is also possible/likely the entity that wins them will publicize the event and acquisition price, to assist in driving the price further upwards after they have their bitcoins. It is also possible that such an increase would bring about enough media exposure and interest to trigger another Bitcoin Bubble. As a community, we should rationally buy as many coins (and sell as few) as possible in the meantime.**

_______________________________________

^1 Additionally, there are stakeholders (e.g. SecondMarket &amp; Coinbase) who **do not want this to happen** and are thus further incentivized to bid at the going market-rate simply to ensure such a dump cannot occur and devalue their current holdings.

^2 As long as there is [more than one bidder involved.](http://www.coindesk.com/list-possible-silk-road-bitcoin-bidders-allegedly-leaked-us-marshals/)

^3 Yes, even including Chinese exchanges.

^4 As SecondMarket has been doing, and which almost certainly has already diminished significantly as a serious option for similarly-minded opportunists.

^5 Which increases risk/uncertainty in acquisition-price, because of Bitcoin’s infamous price volatility.

^6 Especially if you’re buying in bulk, and especially in the post-Gox era, while Bitcoin is still in the “Wild Wild West” stage and we still don’t really have any reputable exchanges which an interested institutional investor could safely categorize as “trustworthy” in any meaningful sense. Much less in America.

^7 Of course, if someone *did* manage to acquire the coins for a discount (Scenario #1), they would want to keep the details as-private-as-possible, to avoid devaluing their acquisition as well as maintain the arbitrage opportunity as much as possible.


^8 Additionally, they would simultaneously realize “these auctioned coins are not in danger of being dumped on the market” which would assuage the market uncertainty/fear and would thus further contribute to a price-rise.

^9 Well, everyone who is pro-Bitcoin, at least.

^10 This makes sense to do if you’re expecting the price to increase anyway, which the results of the Game Theory analysis expounded above should indeed lead you to expect.",cryptocurrency,1403153023

personalfinance,"No more grants, what do i do?","First time posting to personal finance but i think some of you may be able to help me understand my situation.

A quick back story: I'm 24. I'm slowly putting myself through university and plan on going more than full time this fall. If i keep an average of about 14 (12 is full time) credits per semester i should graduate within the next 3 years. The pickle I'm in is... The past few years i took it easy taking 7-10 credits while working an average of 32 hours during the semester. This past year I some how made $23,000 (33hr/week avg) putting me just over the ceiling for federal grants. Usually i would just use the 1-2k in grants every semester and pay off the rest in cash, and take out a small interest (3-4%) subsidized federal loan to cover what i couldn't. I currently have about 5.8k in sub. loans... Because of the 23k i made last year, i have apparently disqualified myself from federal grants (and yes, i have checked in with my financial aid office to make sure this was the reason.) I do have enough in federal sub. loans approved to cover the majority of my school tuition while i can cover the rest as well as books on my own.

The reason this is of concern is due to the 16 credits i will be taking this fall, i will be cutting my hours back to under 28hrs/week or less. putting me at what i estimate as about an average of $900 per month after taxes to live on and save with. Hopefully I will re-qualify for grants as my savings/month will diminish. 

I'm usually pretty good with money management considering the about 6k i have in savings from the past year and a half.

My current expenses are: (monthly) 

About $420 average for rent and bills/utilities, sometimes $100 higher if i and my roomates need to find another.(this is extremely low considering the cheapest studio in this town runs a minimum of $550 not including bills... I have managed this by having 4 other roommates lol)

I generally spend about $300 on food including eating out. (i realize this is high compared to most people on here but I'm a 180lb male working a physically demanding job that also does not like ramen. I wish to think its and acceptable amount)

I do have 1 family member that allows me to be on his health insurance and helps me with car insurance. (car is paid off) Which may not be the case in the next year or possibly 2.

About $80 on psoriasis medications.

$60 on phone.

$80 on gas.

between $50-$100 on entertainment including things like netflix or going to movies etc.

I estimate i'll have about 25-28k in loans if i continue to limit my loans and pay for things like books on my own. (and actually graduate on time)

I suppose the question here is: Am i on the best path possible financially just taking out the loans i need to finish school over the next few years? (and hopefully regain grants as my income drops) Is there any way of obtaining grants that are apart from the usual fafsa-&gt;school way.

I realize i could cut back a little on food and a bit on entertainment if needed although i'd be lucky if what i can cut back on over the course of a year totals even close to 1k.

I will check this tomorrow and offer any other info i may have left out.

news,Information About Boat Interest Rates,"If you have are actually wanting to gain boat finance, you should learn how doing it primarily. To get started, you should look for a proper lender for your boat calculator. Previously, when boating didn't have such popularity as it holds to this day and age, it was much tougher to locate an individual or association that would facilitate you a boat loan. Presently, the situation is turned around, and the trouble of the buyer is finding the appropriate organization to get a boat loan from. Usual, One of them is the ""fixed rate and fixed term"" kind of loan in which a uniform payment on a monthly basis is required all the way through the duration of the loan. Following the preceding payment has been finished, the boat has been entirely remunerated for. ""Variable rate"" loans don't contain a fixed loan rate. The rate differs with distinctive rate indices. For a clear understanding of this sort of loan, the amenable time has to be studied. Balloon payment loans are paid entirely at the end of the loan term. A lot of new or second-hand boat dealers use their own finance executive for carrying on the handling of boat loans. Such managers see to such matters as the filing of the loan application as well as the things that have to be done to finalize the deal in the consumer's name. Numerous dealers are united with the National Marine Bankers Association, an alliance of marine lending specialists. Make sure when submitting an application for a boat loan to stipulate that you want to deal with National Marine Bankers Suggestion. If you go along this way, you stand to obtain greater discounts off the transaction expenses.

 Boat loans are specifically designed to cater the need of UK residents who wish to buy a boat. Boat loan makes the idea of owning the boat look much easier and affordable. It is very similar to a car loan. One of the major things to think about when you want to buy a new marine vessel is the boat loan rate that is obtainable by the finance company or depository. It is very important to compare the rates provided by numerous loan companies so that you can make your decision based on how comfortable you will are with the rates. Even though these seems standard points to think of before choosing a boat loan rates, the practice of calculating how much you should apply for and the installments that you will pay can be a daunting task. This is where a loan calculator comes in. The boat loan rate that you prefer may also be determined by where you intend to get your water vessel from. This loan is available at a low interest rate with flexible repayment options. Unsecured boat loan is not secured against any collateral. Having a boat is a dream that many men secretly nurture. Buying a boat is no different. Most people do not know much about boat interest rates because not everybody owns a boat in their life. Boat loans are of two types - secured and an unsecured boat loan.

I bought a home in Cleveland at the end on 2006.  In retrospect, one of the word times to buy.  I quickly became underwater, and remain there.  I still owe ~$100k, while the house, according to Zillow at least is around $94k.  

My mortgage at the time had an APR of 6.85% fixed.  Of course, that is a crap rate since 2008.  It is with a local company, Third Federal Savings and Loan.  I would like to refinance and get that rate down.  

Why not HARP?  Unfortunately, Third Federal still owns my mortgage, and thus it has never passed through Fannie or Freddie.  Thus it is ineligible, which has been the bane of my existence for 4 years.  Still, in my 8 years there, I have never missed a payment.

Third Federal refuses to do anything.  I have tried.  So I tried to wait for modifications to HARP, something Obama has been talking about for the past 2 years.  But nothing.  Even the now-confirmed Mel Watt has refused to make changes.  

Recently, though, I did hear about another program less publicized than HARP: The FHA Short Refinance.  The difficulty: Third Federal does not participate.

personalfinance,I just got my first full-time job. How do I proceed?,"I'm currently living rent-free back home and just got a $32,015 salary government job, so I'm earning about $1700 per month after deductions.  My debts include:

Student Loan: **$12,683** ($108 per month)

Amazon Store Card: **$1,942** ($100 per month)

Ford Fiesta: **$18,689** ($427 per month)

So, I owe a total of **$33,314** and I'm paying **$635** per month toward that.  

I am not currently paying for regular bills like the car insurance, phone, and utilities - my mother is doing that - so every month I have about **$1000 in spending money**.  And I don't want to just ""waste"" that having fun.  I feel like since I'm living rent-free and currently get help with other bills I should take advantage of that while I can.

Here is more specific information:

As a federal employee I have a Thrift Savings Plan.  3% of my paycheck is going to a Roth contribution and 2% is going to Regular.  I figured since the government matches my contribution up to 5% (plus a 1% automatic), I'd contribute at least 5%.  The contributions are all going into a Lifetime 2050 fund (I switched it over from a G-Fund for government securities after being told the G-Fund doesn't build well).

The APR on my Student Loan is 5.0%, Amazon Store Card 25.99%, and Ford Fiesta 6.39%.

I just started using the YNAB software so hopefully that will help me figure things out.  But what should I do?

I know one of the first steps is to get an emergency fund, so would it be a good idea to open a savings account for that, or can I just use the TSP account for my emergency fund?  I heard it's possible to take a loan out on that account with only a 2.0% interest rate?

And how should I budget my spending money?  Should I try and pay off the Amazon Store Card as soon as possible?

One last note: my name is on a trust that has a house sale pending, so in the near future (maybe by next year) I should be getting around $40,000.  I don't want to depend on that possible future money as a ""save"", but figured it would be worth mentioning.

Refinanced conventional loan:

- MIP - $74

- Monthly Payment - ~$1,350

- Interest rate - 4.25%


My purpose of refinancing is to get a lower interest rate, I probably didn't shop around hard enough when I originally bought my house and ended up with 5%, this was 3 years ago. I'd also like to lower my MIP as much as possible, which a new loan would do. I don't have the principle/interest/escrow numbers for the new loan on hand, but I can get those and add them. I guess it just seems a little too good to be true that I can drop my monthly payments by $150 with relatively little work/money. I had those numbers calculated with the closing costs being rolled into the new loan, so all I'd owe is money for a new appraisal. The loan officer also said it looked like my home had gone from $167,500 to $175,000(pending an actual appraisal) so this would obviously help me get rid of MIP earlier with a better debt-to-principle ratio, but my taxes would also be slightly higher.


Are there any other pitfalls surrounding refinancing I should be looking for?

personalfinance,FINALLY WAS ABLE TO GET INFO ABOUT MY FEDERAL/NJCLASS/HESAA DEBT. NEED ADVICE.,"I have enclosed the breakdown of my debts for you guys to look at. For the TL;DR crowd, please  click on the link.

[STUDENT LOAN BREAKDOWN](http://imgur.com/f5X3bLS)

Basically, I thought I was done with my federal student loans (settled one in March 2014 and paid almost $10,000 for the loan that was originally $7,500.00 Sucks!). It was my fault with not keeping track of stuff Anyways, it turns out I did not settle ALL of them because the Department of Education sent my other student loans to HESAA.

When I called Department of Education they told me these are all Federal loans, and they sent it off to HESAA to take over. The loans are consolidated into one.


The original amount of the loan was $10,375.00. They took about $1,700.00~from my income tax return (from 2012 and 2013). The current balance is $15.543.63, and if paid fully within 2 weeks they will only settle for $14,000.00~ or 90% of today's balance. So it's like my original loan doubled up. Paying almost 20K for a 10K loan. Bad. Very bad. I regret this so much. Its worse than credit card debt, which I can discharge bankruptcy for. =(

If I cannot make that lump-sum payment, I was told that I can pay $171.00 monthly. I will be going to school full-time in August 2014 so I cannot do that at this time. The most I can send monthly is $50.00.

I was advised to consolidate my loans at Direct Loans and my rate will stay the same, at 6.8%, but I will be able to make payments based on my income. I plan to this in August 2014, when I am a full-time student with no income.

My plan is to make some payments to HESAA for now, even for $50.00 a month.

I have another loan, which I found out was separate from the 15K amount. It is called NJCLASS, and it has been sent to a lawyer named Richard Krieg. I have yet to call this guy and to find out how much I owe from NJCLASS. I don't even remember the original amount of the loan disbursed to me. On Monday I will be going to CHASE to see how I originally owe. I still have no idea how to deal with my NJCLASS loan. I'm scared.

personalfinance,leaving pension-covered employment - roll over pension funds into roth or let sit?,"I'm leaving a public sector job in which I have a current pension-fund balance of around $15,000. This reflects 6 years of employer contributions, which are mine to take with me because I've stayed longer than the vesting period (5 years). This pension program is a state-run system, so if I were to re-enter covered employment later on down the line, I would have this base built up and be pre-vested, which would secure an earlier retirement date at that time. However, I'm 27 y/o and feel partially like I'd rather have this in my account at vanguard and get a better return than letting it sit as a contingency for if I go back to covered employment at a later date. I can take this money and roll it into my roth account at vanguard free and clear if that's what I decide to do. 

The way I see it, the opportunity cost of leaving this money alone is potentially ~$350,000, given an 8% interest rate and 40 year maturity. By leaving it alone, I *may* give myself 6 fewer years of employment to earn an equivalent benefit, assuming I go back to pension-covered employment and then work in that role until I'm eligible for retirement.

My wife makes $36,000, which nets $3,117.84 a month (her work allows her to take out 400$ a month for pre-tax child care expenses).  We have about $4,000 in savings, and usually keep a pad of about $5,000 in our checking account for emergencies, etc.

We have 2 kids and pay 1,600$/mo in day care costs.  Our monthly bills and living expenses are around 2000$ usually.  We are fortunate enough to be healthy, and that my work pays for our family health insurance plan.  We have some bad habits (avid gamer, eating at restaurants 1-3 nights a week, etc) but nothing too extreme.  Between us we have two debts, description follows:

We own a house together, and our mortgage is a 30 year FHA, with fixed rate 3.25% APR, for which we still owe $251,767.15.  The current monthly payment is $1,664.62, where $1,133.93 goes towards principal/interest, $125.42 goes towards our property insurance, $136.34 to taxes, and $268.93 goes to mortgage insurance.  On top of that we usually make a payment of between $100 and $200 towards principle.  The home was valued at $275k when we bought it in December 2012, and according to websites now, it's worth between $290k and $310k.

I currently have a total of $33,402.23 in student loan debt, which is between two accounts and 5 different loans.  Here is the breakdown on that: Account 1: $7,524.05 at 6.8%.  Account 2: $5,584.55 at 3.4%, $2.958.28 at 4.5%, $6,043.43 at 5.6%, and $11,212.37 at 6.8%.  The monthly payment on the first account is $91.71, and the second account is $292.01/mo, totaling $383.72 a month.  I believe the way that it works is that I can pay either account separately, but not the individual loans.  

We are fortunate enough that my wife does not have any student loan debt, and that we have no other outstanding debts to date.

My question is this: We recently came into a sum of $40,000, and we're trying to determine what the best use of it would be.  

I spoke with the bank that owns my mortgage, and they said I'd have to pay just over $44,000 to get below the cutoff so we wouldn't have to pay mortgage insurance every month.  My original thought was to pay that off, since the mortgage insurance feels like I'm just paying money to protect the bank, and poof it's gone every month, instead of going into equity or paying off my debt.  Plus we would be paying into our home equity, and lowering the interest payment, etc.

However, paying off the student loans would probably have a more immediate monthly savings, which would definitely be nice.  Their interest rates are a lot higher than our home mortgage as well, and it would cost a fair bit less to pay off than to pay down the mortgage ($33.4k vs $44k).

There's no real hurry to buy at the end of the year other than the fact that 100% of the rent money is going down the drain that could otherwise be going towards equity and ownership. Also the lease ends on Dec of this year so there's that. 

The rent they pay currently is $1700 for a 3bed/1ba/900sq. ft. upstairs unit condo. But they are saving $500-800 a month for a house. According to a mortgage calculator, a $350k house with a $12000 down payment at 4.5% interest rate would come out to $1712.60 a month. (before prop tax, and maintenance) but given the fact that they are saving $500-800 on top of their rent, buying would still be cheaper than renting in the long run. Even if it's not a house and another town house or condo. 

Now for the question. The only debt they acquired recently is they bought a used car and financed it with a credit card. Now that sounds stupid because obviously credit cards are the devil but there was some thought put into it. The reason for this is because banks do not finance used cars that are older than 6 years and have over 100k miles. The car is almost 10 years old but in great running condition. So currently the balance is $3800 on a credit card with an apr of 13%. They have excellent credit in the 800s and have always made payments. Minimum payment is $75 a month.

I did the math and compared the payoff duration to an actual used car loan from a bank at around 6% and the difference is not much at all because they are paying more than the minimum every month. About $200 a month towards the CC. So the time it takes to pay off the debt at 6% or 13% is a difference of only 1 month. 

They can keep doing this and the credit card will be paid off in 22 months. (It would've been 21 months at a 6% apr so not much difference there). It's basically a 2 year car loan. 

Now should they use their $7500 cash saving for their house down payment and just pay this down (or off entirely) and then start saving again? Or should they continue to make the payments every month and view it as a car payment of $200 a month and also keep saving?

If they use their house saving to pay the cc off, they would have to start saving over and it will take longer before they can move out of this place. The lease is up in Dec. 

My opinion is that they should just make the payments on the CC and continue to save. It's much harder to save than it is to make payments in my opinion and they are not paying much interest on this credit card balance due to the high monthly paydown. Also, if they use up $3800 out of the $7500 saved up, they will have to be at their current rented place for another year. It may not be a bad thing since it looks like the housing prices are not coming down anytime soon but they have 1 bathroom, neighbors that have yapping dogs, they live upstairs, live next to a freeway onramp, and just generally do not like the living situation. It's not bad but it's not great. 


What do you guys think? I think saving for that house is the way to go. 



Note: I also need to add that selling the car to pay the $3800 off has been considered. But I did the math and it doesn't seem like a good idea. They need A CAR. So even if this car were to be sold, they need a replacement. The current car can be sold definitely at $7000-7500 (I'm familiar with cars). Assuming they get $7000... minus the $3800 loan = $3200. Minus (taxes and registration on the replacement car. California charges tax on used car transactions so the very act of replacing the car will cost at least $300-500). That leaves something like $2700-2800 on a replacement car budget. At that price point, whatever car they get is going to need work on it.. tires, maintenance, etc. It will be a junker. 
This one has new tires and had a complete maintenance and replacement done last few months and can run for years.",finance,1403222440

dogecoin,A Proposal a Query and a Question,"Ok guys ill lay this one out as flat as i can 

Im using doge/btc as an example as its decent volume and its what we used as our example in the first place.
Ok so your trading doge and the current buy price is 60 sats.

If you wanted to buy 1000 it would cost you (after fees 0.25%) 0.00060150 btc

If you wanted to buy at 61 sats it would cost you .............0.00061153 btc

If you buy at 61 sats theres an increase of (obviously) 1000 sats

QUESTION !

If you were given the choice to buy the same 1000 doge for an extra 400 sats(0.00060550 btc) ,would you ? 

Remember if the price goes up and you want to buy at 61 sats the 1000 doge then costs you 61153 sats

so if i sold you 1000 doge for 0.00060550 and you immediatly sold them at 61 sats 
then you be selling them for ? 0.00060847 so a PROFIT of 297 sats for 
basicly buying and selling at the same price.

Or to put it another way ,you buy in at one price and if you decide you want out you sell at the same price you bought in at and STILL turn a profit.

(NOBODY offers this as far as i can see)

And of course you could hang on and sell them at 62 sats netting yourself 1297 sats in comparison to 1000

An increase close to 30% is not to be sniffed at.

We are toying with an instant profit scenario where you buy for the 0.00060550 btc and you can instantly sell back to us for 
0.00060800 btc,an instant gain of 250 sats.We will wait and see how this ""proposal"" goes down and of course if it is understood.

We think this type of thing is ideal for markets like doge as it is decent volume but no money making opportunities while the price is slow.

If there is interest we will run a sort of closed beta test.a market buying price will be agreed as the the current buying price across the board ,mintpal cryptsy etc 
in which when the transactions are completed we will state what was bought and sold and the participants can give their side of the story on what profits they have made
and we in turn will do the same.We of course are selling below cost price and somehow turning a profit,

that part unfortunatly cannot be revealed but as far as the participants are concerned everything will be as transparent as possible.

EDIT/UPDATE

One of us MAAAAAAY have made a pigs arse on one of the calculations ( i wont say who lol ) but this may work at current buying price meaning YOU can buy at current buy price for LESS than the current price.

We will need a live test with a willing participant but we are 99% sure this is correct

personalfinance,"Cash out refinancing an investment property, and putting it all in a Vanguard total stock market fund","Hey PF. I think I already know the answer here, but bare with me...would love some input and some thoughts to bounce around. 

I own three properties - all outright, and I'd like to refinance one of them. I'd say it's worth about $150,000 or so. It's grossing $1150 per month from rent - after expenses, I'm looking at about $850 net profit. 

I've been toying with the idea of pulling out $115,000 or so of equity, leaving me with a $620'ish mortgage payment every month. 

This is money I don't really ""need"" for anything, but I've been toying with the idea of spreading it across a few Vanguard funds (or, putting it all in a Vanguard S&amp;P500 index) and just forgetting about it. Historically, I've seen that the S&amp;P500 has gained about 7.5% return over the long haul. My thought is that if I can get a &lt;5% interest rate, it'd be stupid not to refinance and re-invest the money elsewhere.

I'd end up with a net profit of about $230/month from the rental property after the mortgage, can deduct the interest portion of my mortgage payments, will slowly build back equity in the home, while still having a sizable investment in another opportunity (stocks) that'll give a greater return than what I'm paying in interest/tax deductions/etc.

personalfinance,Student loan servicer snuck a loophole in my auto-debit agreeement which added ~$12k to my debt--advice?,"I just got $12k added to my student loan as a result of some sneaky wording in my auto-debit agreement.  

My loan debt is about $100k.  I'm on a ten-year graduated plan where my monthly payments go up 30% in two-year intervals.  I'm now just over one year in and paying about $850/month.  Payments are due on the 15th of each month.

So far I've been making payments by logging into the servicer's web site by the 15th and just manually paying the $850.  I decided in May to enroll in KwikPay, which is the auto-debiting service.  So on May 14, I went through the steps online and signed up.  I got an email with the subject ""You have successfully activated KwikPay."" Groovy.  Done and done.

But on May 30, I noticed the payment never went through, so I opened the email.  It said the first payment wouldn't go through until June 15.  OK, cool, no biggie, since thanks to Uncle Sam student loans have grace periods built in -- no late fees or penalties if you don't pay on time.  All good, I think.  I log into the site, click the $850 payment through, and get back to my Dipsy Doodles. 

So June 15 rolls around. KwikPay is in effect, right?  Right.  Except it works *too* well.  Now my account is debited $915. 

?!?!?

I call the servicer.  They informed me that when I enrolled in KwikPay, I e-signed an authorization form that states in the third paragraph:

*I further agree to allow [SERVICER] to grant me a forbearance for all payments due (and not paid) before the start date of my KwikPay payments. If my account(s) is placed in forbearance, all unpaid interest will be capitalized. This may result in an increase in my monthly payment. My monthly statement will reflect any change to my payment amount. This authorization shall be governed by and construed within the laws of the state of [STATE] and the federal laws of the United States.*

So in other words, as soon as I missed my May 15 payment because KwikPay didn't run my auto-debit on time, the servicer automatically put my loan in forbearance -- *economic hardship* forbearance, as the clerk on the phone informed me, which capitalized all the interest that accrued over that time period, and which means that instead of $850/mo, I now must pay $915/mo.  

Oh, and in a year when I reach the next ""level"" of my graduated plan, I'll need to pay 130% of $915 ($1190) instead of 130% of $850 ($1,105).  And so on every two years.  

I did the math, and over the life of the loan it amounts to about another $12,300 or so in payments.  

I try every angle with the clerk. I've never missed a payment.  I have an 800 credit score.  I paid on May 30 as soon as I discovered the KwikPay didn't go.  I enrolled in KwikPay the day before the 15th so I wasn't trying to ""dodge my payment.""  How could we make this right?  Is there anything we can do?

""Unfortunately, sir, it's right there in the terms and conditions of the KwikPay activation, which you signed.""  

I speak to a manager and she too is unable to reverse it.  She adds that if I had activated KwikPay by phone and they had evidence that I was ""misinformed"" about it, they *could have* reversed it, but given I put an e-signature on the document I have no recourse.

The irony here is that the servicer is actually allowed to get away with justifying an automatic HARDSHIP forbearance specifically to KwikPay enrollees who miss their payment, when KwikPay itself is a mechanism specifically designed for people with steady incomes.  The people *least likely to have hardship*.  

I'm at a loss, reddit.  Any advice? This seems like unethical practice, if not downright fraudulent.  Is there anything I can do? 

**TL;DR**:  My debt went into economic hardship forbearance due to loophole in auto-debit agreement, despite a perfect payment history and an audit trail which clearly shows I was not attempting to be delinquent on my debt. Caused my interest to capitalize which will cost me an additional $12k over the life of the loan. Vendor admits they *can* reverse it but are unsympathetic because my e-signature is binding.

personalfinance,"US Military Officer, 26 yr old, ~$92k/year civilian equivalent income--how should my potential for a military retirement affect my investment strategy?","Current financial situation:

Am an aviator and just promoted to Captain (thus I get flight pay that increases more than a normal military member). If I was in the civilian world I would have to be making approximately $92k pre-tax to match my current income. Currently have just over 4 years active duty, and since I'm a pilot I will owe a minimum of 8 more--with 8 more to go after that to receive a military retirement most likely at the rank of Lt Col or higher.

With a 20 year retirement at the rank of Lt Col I will be provided free healthcare and can assume that I will make approximately $4k/month via my pension. I also assume that I will be able to continue working at that point as I will be 42 years old, either as a senior airline pilot or in some other field; I'd be speculating pretty madly if I tried to predict 16 years out on what that secondary job income would be.

Other randomness:

I currently own two vehicles, one worth $5,500 pessimistically, the other worth $10,000 pessimistically. On the 10k vehicle, I still owe $3000 @ 2.49% which will be paid off by February at approx $460/month.

Miscellaneous monthly costs:

Rent $725 + Utilities $125 + Phone $100 + Food $500/month (I eat a lot due to physical activity level) + Insurance $120 = $1570.

I also have $12,000 in student loans that will be forgiven in 6 more years of federal service. I pay $175 per month on these. (At my current rate I will end up paying ~12,600 over the next 6 years, should I just pay this loan off or am I sacrificing opportunity cost by using the money in that fashion?) 

Total mandatory monthly expenditures = $2205. Total monthly post-tax income = $5600. Surplus = ~$3400.

Currently have $22,500 total in checking/savings, no credit card debt. Credit score: 760 (used to be higher, but paid off $25,000 loan at 2.99% called ""Career Starter"" loan from USAA for new officers, damaging my average account age.)

I will see my income grow at predictable rate through my 20 years, culminating in approximately $120,000/year civilian equivalent upon retirement.

So I have access to the TSP and traditional/Roth IRA options through the government. If I do the TSP I will elect to do the 2040 or 2050 L-cycle funds, as I'm healthy and optimistic about living a long time; and I am also not risk-adverse in any way.

personalfinance,"A visualization of why it's important to overpay monthly against student loans, even if you only pay $50 more per month","So I was fooling around with unbury.me yesterday and decided to get a better picture of what overpaying really nets you in the long run. [This graph](http://i.imgur.com/KgC2XfW.png) shows how much time and money a given monthly payment saves me compared to paying $50 less per month. The red star represents $50 more than the highest suggested plan by my lending service. Just paying $50 more than the minimum gets me done with repaying about 20 months earlier and saves over $1500 dollars. 

If I'm thinking in terms of $50 increments, I'd say I definitely want to at least push up to $450/mo, as I still save a whole year and a whole grand as compared to paying $50 less. 

Now, with different interest rates and principals, the numbers will change, but every loan is going to have a rising slope at lower payment levels where small increases net comparatively huge savings. 

edit: seems to be some confusion about the graph. Imagine you went into unbury.me, bumped up the monthly payment in 50 dollar increments, and asked how much each step impacted your pay-off date and interest. That's what this shows. At the left side, there is a steep slope which allows you to make huge gains with just a little extra effort. The returns are diminishing as you pay more and more, but most people on payment plans are likely to be closer to the left than the right.",finance,1403270757

personalfinance,"Parents pushed me to go to college, took control of all of the loans, and now I'm $100k in debt. Surprise!","I'm 25 years old. I graduated from a private college in 2012 with a BS in Graphic Design. I attended this private college because it was the only school in MA, at the time, that offered the Vet Tech program, which was what I wanted to major in. But because I'm absolute shit at math and science, I was forced to switch my major and had to stay at school for an extra year.


Growing up with parents who were not college educated and doing just okay financially, it was drilled into my head that going to college was the thing to do after graduation. I agreed and still agree in a way (would not have the job I have now without my degree), but I wish, oh how I wish, that I took more notice in what my parents were getting into with loans. I was their first child, first person in the family to go to college, and they had zero experience and not a lot of money so did what they thought would be best.


When I graduated, my parents agreed they would chip away at the big loan in their name while I was to pay the lesser loans, one in my name. The big loan, from what my dad tells me, is $90,000 fucking dollars - I believe this INCLUDES the interest. I pay three lesser loans: US Department of Education - $280/mo ($24,000 total), ASC - $110/mo ($15,000) - THIS IS IN MY NAME, and Nelnet - only $50/mo (only $3,000 left). 


I've been living on my own with my boyfriend for a year, so also have bills to pay and make $40,000/yr at my full-time job (supposedly getting a raise this month after reviews are in). I was JUST making ends meet, with about $200/mo leftover every month after bills were paid.  


Well that all changed when the ""monster"" loan bills finally started just last month. From what I understand, my parents have been paying off the interest for it since I started college and now it's time for the actual payments of $400/mo. Luckily, both of my parents took on $100 ea and I was left to pay the remaining $200/mo. As you can see, this now leaves me with $0 extra a month. I have $1,000 in an emergency fund, but if I don't have over $2,000 in my regular account every day, I panic.  


So I'm here to find out WHAT I need to know/gather from my father (he does all the loan stuff) so I can further look into programs like Income-Based-Repayment and loan forgiveness shit. I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing or what my dad is doing. I assume I need to find out what type of loans they are (private/fed)? Interest rates? I'm not sure. 


If anyone could share the bits of information I'll need to find out about each of my loans (not necessarily the big one) to apply for things like this, or how to even go about applying, that would be awesome.",finance,1403275094

personalfinance,I Need Some Auto Loan/Credit Score Advice...,"I recently purchased my first new car (actually a 2013 left-over, thereby avoiding the massive first year depreciation - thanks /r/personalfinance!) and when working out the financing we ran into some snags. 

For some back story, I had some massive private student loan debts which I defaulted on about 6 years ago. Over the past 5 or so years since defaulting, I've been concentrating on reducing debt and revitalizing my credit, and at this point I am debt free aside from some relatively small federal student loans which I hope to have paid off in the next 1-2 years. I now have a high credit limit with a nil credit to debt ratio and a credit score in the high 600's/low 700's depending on the reporting agency. 

Nonetheless, the financing guy at the dealership told me that only one bureau was willing to take on our loan, even though we have more than enough cash to pay for the car outright and were putting a hefty down-payment down (over 50% of the full cost of the car). In the end I got a 6.43% 60 month loan with Capital One, which I plan on overpaying to pay off by the end of 2016. 

So here are my big questions:
* I know that I was a doofus by not shopping a loan and getting pre-approved before going into a dealership and finalizing my purchase. Is there any way of making up for that mistake now, or should I just live with the existing loan for 6 months to a year and then try to refinance for a lower rate?

* The loan broker at the dealership sold me on the idea that maintaining and paying off an installment loan such as this one would have the effect of raising my credit, and therefore this was a better move than buying the car in cash. I know that there’s some truth behind this, but how much, exactly?

* This is a relatively big one: after agreeing to terms, the loan broker had me sign a document which showed the credit score that was pulled for me which the terms were based on. Like I said above, I monitor my score with all three agencies pretty religiously via my AMEX account and the Experian score quoted was a full 50 points lower than my most recent report (643 vs. 693). I assumed that maybe the many recent inquiries could have lowered it, but I ran a new report and re-checked it and that’s not the case. Why would the score they received be so low, and how much would the proper score affect my interest rates and loan eligibility, if at all? I am a long time Capital One customer and have checking and credit accounts with them already…would there be any benefit to trying to call them to explain and try to get the interest lowered?

* My wife has a much better credit score than me (815) but pretty much zero credit history. The loan broker suggested that she would not really be any better off than me in terms of getting a car loan because of this fact. Is this the truth, or was he really just trying to nail me on the high interest loan? Is there anything that I can do about that now?

I believe that’s all my questions for now. I think I may have goofed and I’m not sure how much I can really do about it now. Really it’s not the end of the world, but I wanted to get good advice and information about these questions now so that I can avoid making the same mistakes down the road.

I'm 28 and a graduate student who does some decent contract work on the side. I have recently been educating myself on long-term investment, have built up a $10,000 no-touch emergency fund, and have a $20,000 lump sum left over that I'd like use to start investing for retirement, aiming for a retirement age of about 65.

My desired allocation is 60% domestic stocks, 15% international stocks, and 25% bonds and I would like to use Vanguard's total index funds for each of these asset types. I plan to buy and hold. I have no existing investment accounts and have no access to a 401(k), so my current thinking is to ramp up to my desired allocation over a couple of years starting like so:


**First year:**

Roth IRA: $5,500 in bonds (27.5%)

Taxable Account: $14,500 in domestic stock (72.5%)


The idea there being tax efficiency deciding the asset placement and immediate admiral shares for domestic stock. But then I have choices about how to get to to my desired allocation. I can either skip international stocks in the second year and get them in the third year or I can get international stocks in the second year and fill in the others in the third year. Either way I probably end up with my desired allocation in the third year. All in my Roth IRA, since I plan to max my IRA contribution each year, but I'm not sure if I will be able build my taxable account more than the initial allocation for the next two years.


**My questions are:**

* Does buying order for ramping up my accounts as described matter?

* Do I have anything to worry about moving a good chunk of my net worth into stocks in a taxable account immediately? Based on my projected income I won't pay any capital gains tax (projected AGI &lt; $36,250), but maybe I'm missing something?

* Does the first year plan give me enough flexibility to get and maintain my desired allocation while still being tax-efficient?

* Should I instead do $5,500 in bonds (Roth), $11,500 us stock (taxable), $3,000 intl stock (taxable) and go from there?

* Am I missing anything that makes this plan/allocation/portfolio dangerous or suboptimal?

Running that through a calculator shows I make 120 payments of $1,060.66 for a total payment of $127,279.20.

The loan's cost is therefore $27,279.20.
But if the interest were %6 APR the cost is actually $33,225.20.

It's hard for me to really see the difference between interest rates (besides knowing lower is better).

So why don't we instead list the interest as the total cost vs principle?
e.g. %5 APR = 27.2%
e.g. %6 APR = 33.2%

That's much clearer to me, and I'd suspect the same is true for anyone without a loan calculator on hand.",finance,1403305177

I can tap my IRA penalty free for $10,000 towards a home purchase.  Since my VA mortgage is covering the entire house cost, I wouldn't actually need to spend the $10,000 on the house.  

Would I be allowed to take out the $10,000 and throw it at the student loan?  I realize this is shady, but wasn't sure if it was legal.  I only care about the latter.  Since congress doesn't want to lower the absurd interest rate on student loans, I wouldn't feel bad about exploiting this if it was legal.",finance,1403318170
personalfinance,"Looking for a little guidance with student loans, going back to school. [22M] Long winded post.","To start, I will say I completely fucked up by wildly taking out loans as an 18 year old not realizing the future implications. I've worked since I was 16 in retail but barely had any savings or money for tuition by the time it came to enroll since I was making minimum wage. Long story short, I chose the wrong major and school and ended up $60,000 in debt with no degree.

Since I've left school (about a year at this point) I've found a decent job that has a decent amount of overtime with no benefits. I'm certainly not content in my current situation still living at home (I really can't afford to move out with NJ's apartment costs) I fell about $4,000 into credit card debt at 18% when I was working for minimum wage but paid that off all within the past 18 months. I'm proud of that, but now it's time to move onto the loans I've taken out.

* Private loans 
* $21,044 @ 7.92% &lt;--- Throwing everything that's left at this, usually $500
* 19,426 @ 7.92%&lt;--- Minimum $190
* 12,883 @ 7.59%&lt;--- Parents pay minimum of $120 of this a month
* Direct unsubsidized 
* $4,950 @ 6.8% &lt;--- Minimum $45/month
* $4,398 @ 3.4% &lt;--- Minimum $60/month

I'm wondering that when I make payments to the first big loan that surpass the 2nd big loan in principal, should I alternate monthly payments towards each since they're the same interest rate? Or keep hammering at one until it's significant? Or split the payments down the middle?

Also the representative I spoke to said the best way to pay towards principal is to wait for the due date of the payment and pay then since the interest accrued is at it's peak. Luckily all excess payments go towards the principal for all loans without any clarification.

Onto my budget. Thankfully still living at home affords a very low cost of living.

* Take home is between $1800 and $2300 a month depending on how busy we are as a store, I've budgeted myself for the lower end
* Gas $180/month (live 3 miles from work)
* Food/dining out $150/month
* Saving $500/month towards my car
* Paying $800/month on loans
* $100 for entertainment (movies, concerts, etc)
* Currently have $4,000 in savings to pay for a down payment on a used car

I currently drive my parents car that they're willing to sell and loan me the money interest free to a new car. I'm looking for a small SUV (currently aiming for a Nissan Rogue) for $9,000-$10,000. I know most PF would say go for a beater at the cost I have right now but I need a car that's decent in snow, decent gas mileage and will last at least for 5 years while I get a degree. 

I'm planning on returning to school in the Spring of 2015 to a cheaper university within driving distance that I can pay for in full with my current salary. I have my foot in the door in my current industry, I just need a 4 year degree to cement a higher paid position.

Any thoughts, comments or tips going forward?

personalfinance,529 Plans: Practical pros and cons,"https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/intro529.htm

So I've been on the fence about 529 plans.  I live in a state that doesn't have state income tax so there doesn't appear to be any local benefit.  Federally is the gist that I just save taxes on what would have otherwise been typical taxes on regular investments (capital gains, dividend qualified/non-qualified, interest, etc.)?

Added cons for 529 plans seem to be the risk of the plan not being used and be subjected to a 10% penalty except in the case of death, disability or scholarships.  The taxes portion seem fine as it reduces the taxation to just a deferral of taxes you would have paid otherwise for non-529 plan investments.

On top of that 529 plans appear to be like 401(k) or 403(b)'s in that they limit the type of investments you can have.  Plus there are small % of fees that you may have been able to avoid otherwise through your own individual investing.

TLDR:  Is it worth the hassle, fees and risks compared to investing on your own the same amounts?",finance,1403358014

- 20% contribution to Company stock (max contribution)
     Company matches 11%
- 6% contribution to Traditional 401k
     Company matches 3% of my salary (max matching benefit)
- 6% contribution to Roth 401k
- $2550 per year contribution to HSA account ($106.25 per paycheck) (balance is invested in mutual funds)
     Company provides $750
- $112 per month for WageWorks Transportation benefit (exact cost of the Metrocard) ($56 per paycheck).

The rest are the cost of my health benefits and taxes (fed, ssi, medicare, nys, nyc).

I pay off my credit cards each month and approximately $35,000 in student loans. No other loans. Interest rates vary from 2%-6%, the majority being in the 5% range. I spend approximately $500 - 1,000 a month in misc expenses. 

Cash, I have $28,000 sitting around. My investments + retirement accounts are valued at $66,000.

personalfinance,A couple of questions about 401(k) and possibly quitting work to return to school.,"A little background of myself first.  I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in May 2012 with no debt (thanks grandpa).  I have had a job in the aerospace industry since June 2012 making good money.  I have been contributing to a 401(k) account since my second week on the job at various levels.  My job matches up to 3% (37.5% of up to 8%), and I have been contributing more than the 8% for at least a year (currently contributing 12%).  I have also been contributing to a Roth IRA (fully funded last year, automatic contributions bi-weekly this year to hit the max at the end of the year).

Now on to the questions.  It has always been my plan to return to school to pursue an MBA.  After a lot of thought, I have decided that quitting work and returning for a full-time program is the best option for my current situation and career goals.  Right now I would plan on starting in Fall '15, and not quitting work until at least June '15 which is when company contributions to my 401(k) become vested. I'm living/working in Arizona, but want to move back east to be closer to my girlfriend/friends/family and go to a top-15/20 school (UVA, Duke, UNC).  My problem is I'm very debt averse. I currently only have one source of debt that is a car lease that expires in September 2015 (stupid decision on my part, part of another discussion).  Any one of these schools would add about $120-150k of debt were I to take out student loans in full.  I have several questions about this situation relating to my retirement accounts:

1.  What would happen to my 401(k) if I were to quit work and return to school full time?  Could I roll it over to my Roth IRA?  What would be the tax implications there?  What other options do I have?  Would I basically have to stop contributing to retirement accounts for the 2 years I'd be in school due to not having a job/source of income? (At least UVA recommends not having a job other than summer internship.)

2.  Since I'm so debt averse, I'm trying to think of ways to reduce how much I would have to take out in loans.  Should I reduce my contributions to retirement (i.e. reduce my 401(k) contribution to 8% or less) and start building up a fund to use for tuition?  Or should I just take out student loans to fully fund my schooling and hope the returns on the 401(k) I'm considering reducing being higher than the interest rate on the loans?  Should I buckle down and cut back on my admittedly extravagant lifestyle (eating out, happy hours, bars, lots of travel to see girlfriend/family/weddings etc)?

Current financial situation:
Emergency fund - $7500
Regular savings (travel alot, big purchase items) - $1200
Car lease - $6400
No other debt as I pay 2 CC's off monthly
401(k) - $13500
Roth IRA - $9000
Brokerage account (long term purchases i.e. home) - $3400
Checking account - varies monthly, used for food/alcohol, small purchases, not usually a significant amount, have a separate account that covers all my bills

Going to start putting at least 1000 per month into the loans, however I am not quite sure how to divvy up the payments between the 3.

The 3 loans are:

1. $30,000 federal loan under my name with a 6.6 interest rate. The minimum per month is $300 and it accrues around $150 per month in interest.

2. $24,000 Parent PLUs loan under my dad's name. 7.9% interest rate. Minimum is $150 which is the amount of interest it accrues each month.

3. $6,400 Parent PLUS loans under my dad's name. 7.9% interest rate. Minimum $50 which is the amount of interest it accrues each month.

personalfinance,[US] Starting my first full-time job on Monday. Could you help me plan my financial strategy?,"Hi PF :) 

I've mostly been a lurker reading your financial advice on other members of the community. You have helped me build my credit scores and my financial discipline! :) Thank You! 

I recently graduated from university and moved to New York City for my full-time job at one of the four largest commercial banks. I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me whether my strategy is sound and if you could give me some investment strategy.

Ideally, I would like to save 1/3 of my disposable income.

**Revenue**

* 1st Year Income: $70k base + about $10k bonus + one-time $10k relocation compensation

**Cost**

* Tax rate: 37.5% (federal + social security + state + city)
&gt; $90,000 x (1-0.375) = $56,250

* 401(k): 6% (100% matching up to 6% of total compensation)
&gt; $56,250 - ($90,000 x 0.06) = $56,250 - $5,400 = $50,850

* Rent: $18,000/yr
&gt; $50,850 - $18,000 = $32,850

* Utilities: ~$1,200/yr (I'm not sure. I just moved into a new apartment.)
&gt; $32,850 - $1,200 = $31,650

* Citi Bike: $100/yr
&gt; $31,650 - $100 = $31,550

* Food: $6,000/yr (I might start Soylent ... which would cut my cost to $4/meal)
&gt; $31,550 - $6,000 = $25,650

Then I have $2137.50/mo for all other expenses and saving. I would like to allocate $500 for personal expenses, $1,000 in a regular savings account, and $637.50 in an investment account.

**Savings and Investment**

* Savings: I'm considering putting $1,000/mo in an online account that has the highest yield. Currently considering *Synchrony Bank*, *GE Capital Bank*, *Sallie Mae*, and *Barclays*, all of which have a 0.90% APR.

* Investment: I'm considering putting money in New York-REITs and following ETFs (Crude oil). 

Do you think this is a sound strategy? Please feel free to give me brutally honest feedback.

personalfinance,I need some advice about car refinancing.,"Alright, so here's my situation:

About a year ago, I graduated college. As a gift, my parents wanted to help me purchase my dream car: a fully-loaded Subaru STI (~$41,000). My father has was always quite adamant about buying new and I, being naive, had the same mentality.

Their plan was to get an 85-month loan with a monthly payment of about $600. I would pay ~$250/month, and they would pay down the principal at $700/month, and (ideally) we would have the car paid off in less than 60 months. Don't ask me why they thought that this was a good idea, but at the time I really didn't know any better.

A month later, my dad lost his job, which meant that I had to pay the $600 monthly payments myself. I was a software developer and was making a decent amount of money for a single person at the time (~$55,000/year, pretty low overhead), so it wasn't the end of the world (just... rather annoying).

Fast forward another few months and I'm becoming much more financially aware. I found this sub, started using YNAB religiously, started my emergency fund, and I'm in the process of setting up my 401K and aggressively paying off my remaining credit card debt.

As I gained more knowledge I realized how huge of a mistake that car loan was. It was easily the stupidest financial decision of my life. Now I want to do something about it.

So, this is why I'm here: I want to refinance my car and do what I should have done in the first place: make sure my credit is absolutely excellent (it was 697 when I bought the car, and it now at 780), plunk down a big chunk of cash, and get a reasonable interest rate and monthly payment.

Here's some data:

  * The original term of the loan is 85 months (date of maturity is 05/02/2020)
  * The interest rate on the loan is 5.69%
  * The original loan amount was $40,941.18
  * I've made 13 payments of $593.41 (the minimum)
  * My outstanding balance is $35,667.90
  * I would like to reduce my monthly payments to around $300.00

I'm hoping that someone can help me figure out how much money I would need to put on the car to reach my goal of a $300 monthly payment at my current interest rate, and to show me how I could calculate this number if I wanted to play with the values.

If I'm missing any important information, please let me know.

personalfinance,"What Should I Do With a ""Large"" Amount of Savings? I Have a Car Loan, Student Loans, and am in the Market for Purchasing a Home...","So here's the situation; my girlfriend and I are looking to by a home by the end of this year in Washington, DC. We currently live rent-free with my parents; she makes 52K/yr and I make about 40K. My girlfriend has about 55K in student loan debt and nothing else, and I currently have around 30K of student loans, but I am in graduate school right now and that number will hover around 85K by the time I am out of school in 2017. It is worth mentioning that I am a social worker and I can take advantage of the Federal Government's Student Loan Forgiveness program, but I will still have to make 120 payments (10yrs worth), but once I do, the rest is forgiven (all my loans are Federal, no private). My girlfriend is a federal employee and can utilize that same program.

I also am currently paying off my car, and have about 9K left on the vehicle (1.9% interest and I pay $335/mo to pay it down faster). Neither I nor my girlfriend have any credit card debt, and both of our credit scores are in the mid-to-high 700's. 

My question is what to do with the money I have saved/will have saved by living with my parents. I currently have about 13K saved up, and by the time we plan to move out in December, I will have about 24K in savings; it's not exact, but I have stuck studiously to my savings plan and have not missed a goal yet, so I think that calculation is safe. It might not seem like a ""large"" amount but feels like a huge number to me; it's way more money than I've ever had in my life.

My girlfriend is also a good saver and will have at least 18K by that time (she only just got her job so she is behind me in the savings department). We plan to split the down payment evenly between the two of us.

How should I distribute that 24K? I obviously want to have an emergency fund/something to show for living with my parents for over a year. I also would like to pay off my car so I don't have to pay that plus a mortgage every month, and by December that would mean throwing 7K at the car to make it go away, but I don't know if it would be better to use that 7K for the down payment for the house, because DC is expensive as fuck and the more cash we have the better place we can buy. We are in the process of applying for a loan, but it's a safe bet we'll get approved for about 350K.

personalfinance,Does anyone have any bearing on the Affordable Care Act? I have a question that concerns my finances.,"Last May I had a job lined up that was going to push me over the limit to receive federal subsidies for my healthcare.  This was great I was getting approximately $200 off of a healthcare plan and everything was going just fine.  

Now due to some extenuating circumstances I am afraid that I am going to fall into the Medicaid gap because I live in North Carolina.  I am now questioning if I will make enough at the end of the year.  

So now what do I do? If I continue to pay for the plan ($11.70 a month) and I make over $11,490 I will be fine and everything will work like it is suppose to.  However if I fall below that amount I have absolutely no idea what will happen.  Will I be charged for the subsidy back? Will it all be okay?  What should I do?

This is getting kind of stressful. I am looking for work right now to fill the gap, but we shall see.  So does anyone have any advice, or insight?  I am assuming that I should not continue to pay for this with the subsidy just in case, but how do I go about canceling coverage?  If I just stop paying will that negatively effect my credit? Should I call BCBS and talk to them?  No one on the line at healthcare.gov had any idea and frankly just skirted the issue because none of them wanted to give a definitive answer and be incorrect.",finance,1403463569
Bitcoin,Bitcoin Loan - good idea?,"Hi all.
The decision is made. My over 10y old car is becoming very unreliable and it is time to change it so I decided to take a loan. I already have 2k pounds saved but aim at 7-8k worth car.

I was about to go to my bank tomorrow morning, but then it hit me- why not use bitcoins?

I don't really care to much about interest rates and if I can support bitcoin at the same time...hmm... why not?

I found few lending sites like btcJam but I've got some questions that maybe somebody can answer before I'll go forward with the loan.

1.) Have anybody actually tried taking loan in bitcoins?
2.) Was it a good idea in the end?
3.) What worries me is btc price fluctuation, what happens when btc goes up or down? How this problem is sorted?

Any thoughts?


edit: To be honest I am little disappointed. I was hoping for more reliable info but, well..

I found out though this: 

""BTCJam has loans that are fully in Bitcoin.  Meaning if you borrow 1 BTC, you'll owe 1 BTC (plus interest) regardless of it's future value.  BTCJam also has loans that are tied to the current Bitcoin price.  So if you borrow 1 BTC, which at the time is worth $650, you'll owe $650 USD (plus interest) in whatever value of Bitcoin that is at the time of payment.""

That alone gave me some so hope for the future of loans in bitcoins, however at this time I am gonna go with regular loan from the bank. Thanks all.",cryptocurrency,1403468445
personalfinance,"Just got married, we both have tons of loans, and I am going to be a teacher earning $26,200 a year in Fargo ND. Help keep us from drowning in payments!","Right, I kinda screwed myself in every way possible, and need some help figuring out what my wife and I can do to not drown from payments, etc.

Here's my breakdown:

* $26,200 - Teacher salary, 12 month
* $2,000 - SECA 
* $2,940 - Health\dental\vision coverage (I pay $75\mo for me. Wife still under her dad's plan)
* $2,600 - Disability\retirement

That's income\benefits for me only. Wife waited for me to get a job before she started her hunt. The school I will be working has an opening for a 3\hr a day position for after care that my wife will be taking up, but no terms on pay yet there, so not actually included.

Current expenses: 

* $75\month health\etc insurance
* $580\month Rent
* $20\month T-Mobile (On plan w\ parents, includes both of us)
* $240\6month Car insurance (Car is old and cheap, so insurance is cheap)
* $30\month utilities 

For loans:

* $27,000 - fed loans for me
* $58,000 - fed loans for wife
* $20,000 - fed parent PLUS loans for me.

No car payment, no credit card debt, only current debt is student loans.

Things to note: Teaching position is one in a Lutheran school. This allows for a housing allowance which really messes up taxes and stuff. I can claim 75% of my income for housing allowance. The school is a non-profit, so is there any loan forgiveness that we can take advantage of? Can we, now that we're married, consolidate all our federal loans into a single one for easier repayment? Would income based repayment work best in this situation? I've heard there's an option that breaks it down different than income based, but I can't think of the name. 

We also have $1,500 in a slush fund that is mostly wedding money. $900 of that will be used as first month's rent\deposit, but the rest is emergency fund for now.

personalfinance,Is it possible to negotiate the terms of a private student loan AFTER the loan has already been taken out? Details inside.,"**Background:** I am an international student and completed by bachelors degree from a very well known state university in the U.S. last year. For the first three years, my cost of tuition was financed by numerous scholarships. During my senior year, I was unable to obtain any scholarships. After exhausting all other options I still didn't have enough money to pay for tuition costs. 

Because I was classified as an international student, I wasn't eligible for any federal loans. As a last resort, I took out a private loan for $19,000 from one of the big 4 banks with a U.S. co-signer. 

**Current situation:** I'm doing my masters now so the repayment on the loan is in deference. Interest is continuing to accumulate and will be capitalized to the principal once I complete my masters. It has been little over a year and already around $4,000 in interest has accumulated. 

Is it possible to negotiate the terms of the loan, like lowering the interest rate? If not, do you guys have any suggestions on how I should approach my situation. I don't want my loan debt to grow out of control by the time I eventually find a job.

personalfinance,Pay off student loans one at a time or distribute payments,"I have 2 student loans. One for 7,000, and one for 11,000. Both have 6.55% interest, and both capitalize interest once per year. (Add any outstanding interest to principal) I obviously want to pay off the loans by paying as little as possible, and I was wondering if there was any benefit or loss to paying off one loan at a time or making equal payments on both. 

My guess was that it would be better to pay one first, as every dollar spent towards principal was way more efficient than a dollar spent on accrued interest.

I modelled my loans in excel, (great way to look busy  while doing personal stuff at work btw) and found that I was wrong.  It was going to take an extra 6 months to pay off the loans my way vs. splitting payments on that same monthly payments because the principal you eliminate on the first one is offset by the capitalized interest of the other one,  and then you have to pay more interest on that second one. 


According to my model, the best way to pay off the loans is to make at least the interest payment on both, and then there is exactly zero difference in how you split up payments after that. 

Any chance my model is wrong? Is there an optimal efficiency for paying off loans with the same interest rate that capitulize interest at the same time?",finance,1403496002

personalfinance,$500 to my name. Help?,"(23 M/veteran/plumber)

So I'm reading the FAQ and looking through links, but there's a lot to take in. Forgive me if I've missed something. 


Recently I was laid off, and then had major surgery (paid out of pocket, insurance wouldn't cover it). That adds up to about five months unemployed since September. Consequently, my savings are completely gone. I had $23k at one point, but have paid off a loan, a credit card, surgery, two emergency car repairs, training my service dog (waiting on the VA to refund me the $4700 for that), and being unemployed/on disability for eight months. 


Somehow over the course of these months, my credit card interest has gone up. I've been approved for a loan to pay off the card in full, and have a few hundred left over to help kick start my bank account again. 


Credit card interest has gone from 16% to 22.5%, so I really want the $4400 that I owe (mostly interest, due to paying just above the minimum for five months), gone. 


I can get a loan for 5k, over 5 years, at 16% interest. That means a total monthly payment of $120, as compared to the current minimum monthly payment of $118 on my credit card. However, the interest rate is lower, and would be fixed. So I'm seriously considering this. I'd also be able to pay it off a lot sooner than 5 years, once I get a bit more stable. 


My job brings in $20.99 an hour. Which after taxes and dues, is $582.89/40 hr week. I can't always count on 40, but sometimes see 45-60 hours. 1 July means a pay raise to $23.00, and I am planning on just banking the difference. 

Dues cover union fees, school, healthcare, dental, life insurance, 401k, pension, and a few misc union funds. 


I also get $1300 a month in VA disability. This is going to pay my rent, as of 30 July. My girlfriend and I have to leave our current living situation ($500 a month for a bedroom, I pay it and she buys groceries and keeps up on the laundry/takes care of my dog)


However. My girlfriend makes $280 a week right now, but is applying for part time work and looking for a better job. She will take over the utilities at our new place, as soon as possible. 


My big bills: 
$1200 a month. That's credit card, phone, current rent, car, insurance, a loan from an emergency car repair (1% interest, $250 left to pay), and paying 100/mth (total cost 650) towards a couch my friend is selling me (total value $4000). Oh, and $65/mth for the gym.


My current bank account status: $500 to my name. All bills are paid for this month, however. Payday on Wednesday!


My phone bill can be reduced, the rent (I pay utilities in exchange for the bedroom) will be essentially taken over by my girlfriend, and the 1% loan is almost gone. My car is at 4% interest (no cosigner, I have pretty good credit and got it through USAA), we don't have cable, and my gym membership is being canceled cause we're leaving the area. 

However. I still don't have shit for savings and I'm not sure where to start. I used to pay my bills from the VA money and then save 3/spend 1 paycheck a month. That's how I had money for my $8,000 surgery and to live for the past few months. I can and will claim surgery on my taxes this year, but that's a year away. 


Should I take the loan and pay off my credit card, then have a bit of money to throw in my emergency fund, or should I keep paying my minimum payments of $118 and try to build my savings back up by staying frugal and not going out? My biggest non-bill expense right now is groceries, lol. And my biggest worry is having something on my car/in life go wrong and not having either savings or open credit, and then not being able to get to work. I'm already putting off getting repairs to my car because I can't pay the deductible yet. 


Total take-home monthly income (based on current wages and a $40 hr week): 

$3432 in wages

$1300 in VA 


I'm debating trying to juggle a part time job, but with apprenticeship night classes and being on call 24/7 for work, I'm not sure that's really possible. The VA also still owes me around $2700 for education benefits in January, and those benefits will start back up in September. That money goes straight to savings, and eventually I want to invest it. However, idk when the backpay will come in so I can't count on it. 


Any suggestions or advice would be welcome, I'm trying desperately to get back to that place of having several thousand in my savings account. I really want to propose, but refuse to do that until our finances are in order, until I have savings again, and until we've really figured out how to split costs/save money/be adults.

financialindependence,FI check in - How close?,"Info:  Female, mid 40s, US, recently married, DH early 40s.

I've been striving for FI for quite a few years now.  When I was younger I decided to make a lot of sacrifices so that I could hopefully get enough money in the markets early that it would replace my income completely and I could retire early, or at least have FI early and work on my own terms.  I maxed my retirement (401K and Roth) even when I was making a lot less money.

I anticipated remaining single, and so felt very nervous financially like I really needed a lot of safety net and savings, so drove an old car, bought my clothes at Goodwill, got infrequent haircuts at a CostCutters type place, bought groceries at Aldi's and ate extremely cheaply, was very careful with expenses, etc.

I started out pretty slowly because I had a low income for quite a while, but I lived very frugally and saved and over the years my income has risen quite a bit and I was able to increase my spending a little (I still buy my clothes at Goodwill and get my haircut at a CostCutters type place - with coupon!, but I now eat better quality food and spend more on travel and entertainments).

It turned out that I was not going to stay single forever.  I got married about a year ago.  My husband has made good money and not lived an extravagant lifestyle, so he had a decent net worth and savings.  He came into the marriage with a slightly lower net worth than I did, but a higher income.

**Today, our combined net worth is about $1.8M.  Allocation approximately:**

* $800K in retirement funds (401k, 403b, Roth IRAs, SEP IRA)

* $800K in non-retirement investments (mutual funds, some stocks)

* $160K in our home

* $40K in cash

**Income**

* His: $65K job 1, $65K job 2

* Mine: $82K

Our AGI last year was about $174K - we max our 401K/403b, and so we still qualify for Roths, which we max.

We have a decent house and we each have a car.  We don't carry any debt other than our mortgage (no car payments, no student loans, we pay off credit cards monthly).  We don't feel like we live extravagantly, but we do seem to spend about $5000-$6000 a month, which a few years ago would have given me a heart attack to think about!

**Expenses (monthly, approx):**

* $1000 Mortgage

* $600 Property Tax (high tax area - our home is typical middle-class type home)

* $300 Insurance (home, auto, umbrella)

* $180 TV, Internet

* $160 Cell phones (2, with data plans)

* $200 Heating/Cooling

* $50 Water

* $500 Fed/State Tax payments (DH job 2 doesn't withhold)

* $500 Food (groceries and restaurants - we eat out too much and we are not currently very good at meal planning and sale shopping for groceries)

* $500 Entertainment (sports, drinks with friends, games)
* $500 Travel (averaged over a year)
* $1000 Shopping (averaged over a year: clothes, furniture, haircuts, pharmacy, veterinarian, anything other than groceries)

Some of these costs are higher due to our wedding and a move, and we are working on being better about groceries, entertainment, and ""shopping"",   So our expenses may reduce some.  However, I don't anticipate a huge reduction.  Of course we should get rid of our TV service, cut our cell phones down, etc, but at present we haven't made ourselves do it (plus DH thinks we save a lot already and that these items help us enjoy life).

Are we close to FI?  DH wants to quit Job 2 in a few years, and my own job is turning hellish and sometimes I want to say ""F it!"" and leave.  I'd love to stay home and just be a wife but I don't know if we're FI enough yet.  (Also, DH may not agree to it, so I would likely work, possibly part time, but income would likely be halved).",finance,1403535275

personalfinance,Pac. NW Real Estate Conundrum. Help!,"First, a brief outline of the problem. My wife and I own a house in Portland, OR. In late 2012, I accepted a job in Seattle, and we relocated to a rental house up here, with the intent to eventually buy. At that time, we decided to rent out our Portland house (for a profit) rather than sell.

The problem right now is that real estate prices are skyrocketing in both cities, and we're not sure how to proceed.

We are interested in buying the house that we're currently renting, and the landlord has indicated that she's considering selling it, but she won't commit to a timetable. So, it may be that she wants to hang onto it for another 5 years, which would be unacceptable to us (the place needs work that we would like to get started on earlier than that).

Of course, if we knew that she 100% won't sell us the house within the next 18 months or so, we'd probably sell our Portland house and start looking for another place to buy right now...because I'm worried that we're going to get priced out of the market here, even though our Portland house SHOULD be appreciating as well.

OK, enough backstory. Here are the numbers.

* Our Portland house is currently worth $370k according to Zillow. Zillow estimates in that zip code seem to line up pretty accurately based on past experience.
* To buy a somewhat equivalent house in Seattle, we'd be looking in the $500-600k range.
* We owe $190k on the Portland house.
* We currently make about $400/month cash profit on the Portland house, not counting maintenance expenses.
* We currently gain about $300/month equity on the Portland house as the tenants pay our mortgage.
* Current income is roughly $80k, although I am in line for a ~25% raise within the next 2 years or so.
* My wife currently stays home with our kids, but she'll be returning to the workforce within the next few years as well, which should boost our income by 50% or so.
* We have about $30k cash, aside from retirement/401k accounts/etc...

So, my questions:

1. How risky is it to wait another year or so before making a move? Prices have been going crazy and there have been bidding wars on properties up here. It seems like bubble behavior, but there's a TON of money in Seattle to support this kind of crazy market. I have to specify that we are looking to buy IN Seattle, not in any suburb. If we moved RIGHT NOW, we could probably find something we like...but not in our current neighborhood*.

2. Assuming we sold the PDX house for $370k, how much can we afford up here? I think we could get approved for a loan up to around $600k or so, and if I'm doing my math right, I think we'd have about $65k left in the bank after putting $120k down. I think if we did that, we'd be stretched pretty thin for a couple years, but I'd feel OK about it with a $65k cushion in the bank.

3. Should we suck it up and just keep renting for a few more years? The Portland house being cash-flow positive is obviously nice, but I'm worried about interest rates and home prices continuing to creep up here. I don't want to find myself in a situation where I can't afford to buy in Seattle.

*-The place we're renting is in a sweet location, and we basically can't afford any other houses around it. The only reason we might be able to afford the one we're renting is that it hasn't been updated at all, and needs tons of work. That's why I think it's worth SOME amount of risk to wait it out and see if the landlord will sell to us. I'm just not exactly sure how much risk we'd be taking on...",finance,1403541639

personalfinance,Can we afford to buy a condo?,"Here's our situation:

Wife and I are thinking about getting a condo or a small town home since we're gonna have a baby soon and our lease on our current place is up pretty soon. We were thinking about this 6 months ago but at the time we were much worse off than we are now. We are very disciplined with our loan payments and such and always try to throw in $200 - $300 extra towards our loans as best as we can. So far this year we have paid around $24k into our loans (tax refund and bonuses were all thrown at loans). I love tracking all this stuff, makes wife and I feel motivated every time we make some damage to our loans

Here's our current scenario:

Income:

* $8000 after taxes (at a minimum). We have a ton of loan payments (both of us are doing putting 6%-10% into 401ks as well)

* $2640 - student loans, one personal loan and two cars
* $1020 - rent
* $1000 - E/savings-3month savings
* $500 - helping family with bills
* $150 - average electric bill
* $350 - gas
* $400 - eating out
* $350 - groceries
* $125 - phones
* $60 - Internet
* $100 - car insurance

We have about $142k in student loans, (the highest interest rate being 6.8% on around 4 of the loans). Also $18k in car loans left over.

We have saved up around 14k now since the beginning of the year so we can have an E-fund/3 month E-fund. Now we might probably use this money except $2000-$3000 e fund to fund the purchase if we decide to go that route.

We are thinking of getting a small $80-$120K condo, putting hopefully 10% down and taking a loan through our bank and going that route.

Would we be taking a big risk by doing this? Moderate risk would be fine I guess. I mean we are already at moderate risk with the loans we have. I know when the baby comes expenses would go up, but we are getting a lot of hand-me downs from family and they are helping us with a lot of stuff. We also have room in our budget to account for it, as in we can stop helping with the family bills. Hoping everything goes well, wife will be taking two months off while getting paid vacation. My father has agreed to help a little (couple thousand here and there) if/when we do get into a sticky situation.

We've been following advice on here since a couple years. Even before we got married and have been able to make huge strides so far. Thanks for the help so far. Looking forward to what /r/pf thinks

PS: We are just starting to look for a place. Any advice on how to deal with Realtors and banks and such would be great. Sometimes great Realtors come by and sometimes not so much. So any advice would be great.

Edited for formatting

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses guys. After speaking with the wife and evaluating the different options we decided not to touch the emergency fund and to come up with a new savings for downpayment. We're gonna be renting for another year but our rent will go up to 1200 which I guess is still not too bad given our situation. Hopefully within the next year we're able to make some more progress on our loans before starting to look at houses. Thanks for all your suggestions.",finance,1403543047

I had to finance a car without a credit history about 14 months ago. Value of the car was about $10.2k and I made a down payment of $5k and only bank that offered me financing for $5.2k without a credit history asked about 28% interest rate. Car dealer told me that I can refinance it with a different bank about 6-7 months later once my credit history is created. 

After 8 months of paying $235 each month, my credit score became 680 and I had a $4.8k pay off quote, so I visited my bank applied for refinancing my car but my bank rejected my application because I was not a US citizen. I applied about 8-10 banks or credit corporations to refinance my car. 

All denied because either one of followings reasons;  
•I am not US citizen  
•I don't have long credit history  
•They can't re-finance car loans under $5k.  
•I didn't have the 3 years extension work permit to stay in US.  

I didn't know applying/getting rejected for a credit loan could hurt my credit score.

We are currently working on aggressively paying off our debt.  We’re putting around $2,000-$3,000 per month on the credit card (It is down from 12k) until we get it down to $0.  We are doing this with a performance bonus that is coming in from a project last year.  After that we plan on paying off the Car loan, then the hospital debt.  After that we plan to save up $9,000 in a liquid emergency fund, but it could be a year or more until we have all this paid off and the 9k emergency fund saved up.

All this being said, we would like some direction on how we should plan to purchase a home.  Both my wife and I desire to be homeowners.  It’s a lifelong dream for both of us.  Unfortunately due to some poor financial decisions and 2 failed contraceptives, we both have poor credit scores (620 and 580).  We are conflicted, we know the smart thing to do is save the $9,000 but we’re also being told by lenders that homes and interest rates are going to start skyrocketing soon (a sales tactic, I know, but there is some truth to it). 

With the value of homes and interest rates rising, my wife thinks that we should save up for our house first and then focus on our emergency savings.  We were told we would most likely qualify for a loan at a interest rate around 4-4.5%.  Her argument is that by the time our credit score is up above 750+, the interest rates will have gone back up that we’ll end up paying a high interest rate anyway.",finance,1403545532

Granted, some of this is for crap I didn't need, and age has taught me to be more frugal, but at this point I need to escape without ruining my already low credit score (around 640).

I was speaking with a company that consolidates all credit card debt into one payment at a much lower interest rate than I'm paying now.

She said that the only change in my credit report would be that the cards are closed and my debts would be reduced over the consolidation of 3.5 years. The catch is that I cannot open any new cards in that period, and I cannot apply for any new loans in a 12 month period.

She emphasized that this is a debt management program, and not a settlement program, so there is no negative affect on my score. Is this program advisable? It will save me about $500 a month in credit card payments and actually make me feel like I am conquering my debt.

We are first time home buyers so all the home buying stuff is new. Also will be first time parents as well...so that's all new to us. We need to figure out if we can afford this. I did a bunch of calculations of our finances and I ""think"" we can afford it. We are combining our incomes and debts so that hopefully this can be a bit easier, she probably couldn't afford it to pay exactly half. So I created a throwaway and seriously need some help.

Hers after taxes-$29,110.92
Total for lazy: $66,863.76

She doesn't have much saved up and I have about $10,000 we were going to use for closing costs and new home stuff.

We have a USDA Rural Loan, the offer accepted was for $232,000 with about $3k back at closing. We don't have 20% down so we will be paying PMI and doing 0% down. The estimated monthly payment for the mortgage, PMI and taxes will be $1,710 and I am hoping that is high, but that's what our bank told us the estimate is. 

I have 1 school loan and she has 2, we also have a car loan. 
Minimums on the school loans are $563.13
Car Loan is $175.00 and we have discussed getting a smaller car, but the car loan has the highest interest rates and will be our main focus after we sign on the house.

My loan still has about $14k left and I am unsure of hers, she has one that is similar to mine and another that is higher, maybe $20k. Car loan is the lowest at about $7k

I checked a couple of websites for average cost of a child for the first year and came out with an average of $12,000, but it has to include child care, maybe not for 5 days a week as we could possibly arrange some working from home.

Out of that income, we have approximately $947 in non-housing expenses per month (making our debt/income ratio ~14%) detailed as such:

1. ~$5,000 balance @ 1.9% on her car ($320/mo minimum)
1. ~$8,700 balance @ 1.9% on my car ($260/mo minimum)
1. ~$9,400 balance on federal student loans @ 5.5% ($53/mo minimum)
1. ~$42,600 balance on private student loans @ 3% ($314/mo minimum)

Our current lease expires at the end of this year, so we're looking to get a house around then. At that time, we'll have approximately $37,400 saved to go towards a down payment. In our current market, a house that would meet our wants and needs would most likely sell for anywhere from $250k-$400k, depending on location in the city/county we're in. So, any way you slice it, we won't meet the 20% mark for not needing PMI with a $37.4k down payment.

personalfinance,Paying off debt fast or slow - at first,"25, very single. 125k student debt 10y@6%. 125k/yr salary. Would expect this to be 150k within next couple years. 200-250k once completely established. 

After taxes and living expenses (including base monthly payment on debt), leaves me with 45k/year. 
Even if you consider my salary didn't go up, if I threw all that disposable at the debt it would be gone in 2 years-ish.
On one hand, I like the Dave Ramsey style, get debt free ASAP philosophy. It is the seemingly most responsible thing to do...But as far as I can see, paying this debt off is not going to be an issue for me...and thus I assume not a big stressor. 

On the other hand, let's say I didn't do anything but pay the base monthly payment. As far as my math goes, the difference between paying it off in 2 vs 10 years is about 25k in extra interest. That isn't enough (~1/5th of my disposable yearly income once established, assuming same living situation) to make me upset.

So assuming situation 2...I would have 45k left over for whatever. Let's say I decided to splurge on things, immediately (unlikely). The only big thing I can see splurging on is a new car. So say I financed the car. Say I really splurged. 50k new car. Financed it at the current insane interest rates (5y@3%). That's 10k per year. 35k left. Say I splurged again, spent 10k on everything else for the year (clothes,entertainment,other unnecessary new things). 25k left. At this point I can't figure out what else I would spend the money on. So say I banked that as savings/emergency fund. Say I lived like that for 2 years. I would have 50k in savings and probably more stuff than I could possibly need.  With a buffer like that, I would feel completely safe (and probably satisfied in life too) to start adding money onto the loan payments and could probably easy get rid of both loans in a few more years...

I am just not seeing a huge reward for being really aggressive with my loan repayment right out of the gate..In fact it actually seems safer to me to go ahead and get some money in savings. 

I am looking for comments on my thinking or advice.",finance,1403573539

personalfinance,Which debt to pay off first? (CA),"I have two loans: a car loan of $9859 at 3.9% interest with $220/month payments, and a student loan of $12300 with 5.5% interest and a $108/month payment. I currently make a $150 payment on that loan every month because it's an easier number for the budgetz. 

**I got about $2000 from a tax return, and I'm wondering where the best place is to put it.** In coming months, I'll have a few hundred extra dollars each month to put into debt repayment as well, so I'd like to figure this out so I can make the best use of the money going forward. (details below)

My gut tells me to throw any excess cash on the student loan because it's got a higher interest rate and principle; however, I'm planning on going back to school part-time starting at the end of this year (Nov-Dec), which means I can pause my student loan and not have to pay anything on it nor incur any interest charges while I'm in school. (Will still be working full-time.) I could, during that time, put that $150 onto my car loan. Also, if I lose my job (which I doubt is going to happen but is always a possibility) I can have the interest on the student loan paid for me for a period of 6 months, with 0$ monthly payments on the principle. No such flexibility on the car loan. I've used unbury.us a lot and it's a great tool, however it doesn't take into account the possible flexibility of a loan.

Extra details: I'm currently working full time making 45k/year, bringing home about 3k per month. After basic expenses (rent, insurance, above stated loan payments, utilities, internet, etc.) and a fairly tight variable spending budget, I have about $900 income which I'm currently dedicating to savings and debt repayment (currently putting 500/mo into savings, 300/month into additional debt repayment and 100/month as a buffer which will be added to debt repayment if it's not needed that month.)",finance,1403580474

personalfinance,Buying in Calgary AB vs Renting vs 'other' (CA),"Here is my personal financial details. Early 30's, 15 years as an equipment operator, 1 year out of school now working at an engineering firm as a technologist. 

Income:
Salary of $66,500. 
- With overtime, ~73,000 - $78,000
- After tax ~$55,000

Assets (School is expensive yes):  

* $10,000-car
* $20,000 checking
* $1,500 physical gold/silver
* $6,500 Shares ~4% yearly dividend average
* $1,000 Company RRSP, matching contributions. Already maxed out I believe.

Debts:  

* $0

Monthly costs:  

* $1,400 Rent
* $500 Eating out/groceries 
* $184 insurance/cellphone/internet
* $150 gas
* $500 for incidentals / clothes etc
* $300 for entertainment

Basically, I'm able to save about $1500 per month without really budgeting, depending on how much overtime I want to kill myself with.

I'm currently renting in Calgary Alberta. Right now the rental market is as close to 0% as it really can be. Thankfully I have a nice (if small) apartment with a great landlord who wants me to stick around, and is limiting rent increases somewhat.

I pay $1,400/m which includes parking and all utilities. It's not the cheapest rent I could find, but a nice location. 30m drive, 1h bike to work. I just signed another 12 month lease.

Now for the questions. I'm starting to think about trying to buy a house in the future. The problem is that Calgary is one of the most expensive places for housing in Canada next to Vancouver and Toronto. Average house prices here are around $450,000. I really do not like the idea of buying a condo due to the extreme liability. The cheapest I can find for a duplex is about $250,000.

The last time I spoke with an adviser, I was told $250,000 is about the most I could afford.

Should I just sit tight and hold the course for a couple more years? I'm at the point already where I need to start talking about significant raises to my bosses. For my experience and abilities I should probably be at a base salary another 10-15k higher. Though that might cut into the amount of overtime I would get, which might balance out, but would be more reliable.
  
I just hate watching $1400/m go away with nothing to show for it. But to me it seems that interest rates aren't going to be so low for much longer, so if I can only afford a $250k mortgage now, what happens when it does rise another 2-3 points...
  
  
My other idea, is to buy some plot of land, somewhere in BC or in an area that should increase in population in the next 10 years, preferably under $80,000 and get it paid off as quickly as I can afford. Then just sit on it. No rental income, but should appreciate and could potentially be a place to build on later.
  
I really don't know what I should be working towards. Any input would be appreciated greatly.",finance,1403587675
personalfinance,Question about credit: number of accounts and length of account history.,"I'm hoping someone can help me with a couple of credit questions:

My credit is in pretty good shape, except that right now my card utilization is high. I am working on getting it down, and that seems to be the major component in getting my credit back on track. I have a few questions about moves that I am hoping might help me.

I am wondering if my husband added me as a cardholder on his existing credit card account, if that would increase the number of accounts ""I"" hold. My number of accounts (according to credit karma) was on the low side, and I am looking to improve that, but I'm not about to go applying for a bunch of credit cards, etc. to do it.

Also, if he adds me as a cardholder, will this have any effect on the average age of my accounts? This account was opened about ten years ago.

Both of these elements of my credit profile were doing reasonably well until I paid off my student loans last month (which were on the books as four different accounts, so it hurt certain areas of my credit profile.)

We do not use his credit card, because late payments many years ago mean that my husband pays a 29.9% penalty interest rate, but since we don't want to have his account closed, we plan to auto-pay our netflix on the card, and auto-pay the credit card as we do now (before we acquire a balance).

In short: According to Credit Karma (which I understand is limited, but also free and constant), my credit is currently 701, and based on prior experience, it will jump to 764 once my usage percent is better. I am looking to improve my credit long term in other ways, and I am hoping that I can gain another account if my husband adds me as a cardholder.

Can someone tell me if this would be in our best interest? If it won't positively affect my credit, we won't bother. If this could improve my credit score simply by becoming an additional cardholder, that would be nice. Also, if he adds me as a cardholder, will that require a hard-credit inquiry of me?",finance,1403590044

personalfinance,"I was young and stupid once, and now I'm young and paying for it","Don't get me wrong, I'm still pretty young and stupid, but I'm trying to learn.

So, here's my story.

When I was 18, I was fortunate enough to receive a pretty massive inheritance from my grandparents, and shortly afterward, I blew all of it. I studied abroad in France and spent a small fortune, and after returning stateside, I had one hell of a lavish summer with my ex-boyfriend, pampering him with gifts and taking insanely expensive trips.

Fast-forward 2 years, it turns out I was actually going to end up needing that money. A lot of my family members passed away, financial issues came up, and I ended up having to pay a lot of bills with not a lot of cash. 

Fast-forward around a year past that, and here's my current situation, at the wonderful age of 21:

I have a personal loan that I haven't made a payment on in probably 6-7 months because I just do not have the money.

I have two maxed out credit cards - one has about $450 charged to it while the other has about $650.

As you can well imagine, my credit score is horrendous. The last time that I checked, it was right around 540, and I would say that if anything, it has only gone down.

I have student loans (totaling around $15,000), but they're all federal, and I am not currently required to pay on them, but here's the kicker:

I'm going to be applying to medical school in 1 year (meaning that I will be starting medical school Fall 2016).

So, I'm finally back in a place where I'm making ends meet. I have a new job that brings home roughly $1,600 a month, and my absolutely necessary bills (rent, utilities, internet, cellphone, etc) come out to be right around $800-$850 per month. It's also worth noting that I have the ability to work unlimited overtime at my job at a rate of $17/hour, so if it would greatly benefit me, I *could* pick up extra hours, but I'm also a full-time student in my last year of school, so I can't get too overwhelmed.

Basically, I'm trying to find a way to pay down this debt as much as possible and raise my credit score before I enter medical school in two years time because when I'm living off of medical school loans (for those who don't know, you cannot hold a job in medical school), the last thing I want is personal debt hanging over my head, and I'd *like* to have some sort of emergency fund saved up by then. 

The problem is that I feel like even though I can sit down and crunch the numbers of how much I bring home a month and what my bills are, when I really have the money in my hands, I don't have that much. It feels like it all disappears, and I don't think I'm spending in excess when it comes to groceries and gasoline, etc. 

So, what do I do? How does a historically, poorly financed young lady become a financial grown-up with a budget in 2 years?

personalfinance,Cosigning for an Auto Loan,"I'm thinking about cosigning for my girlfriend's auto loan when she saves up enough for a down payment. First of all, I know the risks involved. I've read ""don't do it"" a hundred times and seen my fair share of Judge Judy. I see and understand the logic in the warnings. I know I'll inevitably have people tell me it's a terrible idea anyway, and I haven't fully decided to do it by any means, but I want to explore the option. 

Here's the situation:
Right now, she's using my car which is OK because I'm able to carpool to work. Problem is, I want to change jobs as soon as possible, and when I do I'm going to need my car. I can borrow my parents' car for a while, but that's not a long term solution. She's just started her job, so she has to save up for a while before she can think about getting a car. 

The reason I'm thinking of cosigning is because her credit is somewhere around 615, I think. Mine is around 715. **My question is:** If I were to cosign, how much would that help with getting her a decent interest rate and monthly payment vs. her going it alone? The other option I considered was actually getting the car myself and having her make payment to me, not sure if that's a better idea (given that I already have a car payment to make so I don't know how that would effect the rate they offer me) but I would still like to hear the answer about cosigning regardless. Any other ideas would be appreciated as well.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge!

**EDIT (further question, from comment below):**
Let's say I do go the route of buying the car in my name. How would I go about doing that? Would she be able to make the down payment directly, or would it have to go through me? Same question with the monthly payments: would she be able to pay them with her credit/debit card, or would I have to pay them and then have her pay me back? I also question what kind of rate I would be able to get when I already have an auto loan ongoing (I have no idea). The loan I got was 60 months at ~$281/month with a 1.7% APR if that helps at all.

personalfinance,Three housing options. Need help deciding which is best.,"My fiancé and I currently are lucky enough to live in a situation where we are not really paying any housing costs or bills (beyond about $100-$150 in groceries every week), we are getting married at the end of next summer though and we both would like to be in our own place by the end of this summer to give ourselves a little time between the two major events (buying a house and wedding). We have $90K saved in the bank and right now we make a combined $167K/year, however, we are both currently in the interview process for jobs that would increase our income to a minimum of $190K/year and a maximum of about $225K/year (fiancés job has a lot of OT available). We have no loans currently and own all of our cars completely. We do live in a very expensive area though so our money doesn’t take us too far. Over the past 6 months we have been working with a real estate agent to find a house in our current area in the 300-500K price range and although we have made a few offers we have not fallen in love with anything we have seen. After a lot of long discussions we have decided we have three options:

1.        Pick a starter house in the area we currently live in (suburbs of major city) that is at the lower end of our budget, do lots of renovations to make it ours, live in it for a few years and then move on to something bigger and better when the size of our family requires it and our income allows it. The pros of this option are that we wouldn’t need to stretch our budget at all (especially if we both got our new jobs), we would be able to save a good amount of money, we would have extra money to spend on vacations and other activities that we enjoy and when we have kids I would be able to stay home with them and we could still afford our house. The cons of this option are the long commute to work for both of us (90 mins each way), the risk of losing money on the house when we sell due to renovations and that we will have to move out of this house in a few years because our family and income will most likely outgrow it.

2.        This option depends on us both getting the raises we are working on now. Buy a house that we would both want to stay in permanently in the same location that we are in now (would probably be about 700K with a 600K mortgage). The pros of this option are that we would be getting the house that we want, we would have a very nice home, we would not have to worry about moving and due to the status of the housing market in our area right now this house will become more valuable than what we will pay for it. The cons of this option are that we would be pushed to the very end of our budget even with the extra money, it would be difficult to save, fiancé would have to work lots of overtime just so that we can afford the house, we wouldn’t really have any discretionary spending money for vacations or anything else, when we have kids I would not have the option to stay home with them and we would also have the 90 minute commute.

3.        Rent for a year in the city that we both work in. The pros of this option are short commute time, closer to friends and it’s a quick way for us to be living in our own place. The cons of this option are that we are really just delaying our decision on a house by a year, interest rates could go up and we will be spending the same money on rent that we would on a mortgage (probably right around 3K a month) so not saving but also not really getting much for our money.

I prefer option 1, my fiancé prefers option 2 and option 3 is the middle ground for us. From a more objective point of view, what is the smartest thing for us to do?",finance,1403616829

personalfinance,"What makes the most sense, paying off loans quick, or saving for retirement?","My girlfriend recently graduated from school with an architecture degree.  She got a great job at a firm but she has a lot of student loan debt.  She  pays a fair amount of money into retirement and a smaller amount towards her debt.  The idea here is that the retirement fund will pay out more than the debt will cost her in interest rates (at the rate she is paying it).  Her retirement fund is a 401k and her current employer does not match it.

She puts about $600 towards her loans every month and about $500 in her 401k.  She has about 50k left in loans.

Is this the smartest approach to her financial situation?  Does anyone have any suggestions?",finance,1403622492
personalfinance,"401k enrollment help (required to join, salary reduced by the % the employer is contributing to 401k)","So here is the background.  

At my one year mark I scheduled a review with the office manager since we don't do that automatically and I negotiated a 5% raise. Immediately after agreeing to the raise the office manager mentioned that she was going to give me the raise but that I should know that since I will have been with the company for over a year that I was now going to be required to contribute to my 401k plan which is a 5.75% contribution so once enrolled I won't actually be seeing a difference in my take home pay. She mentioned that there are legal requirements to do this. She said she was going to bump my salary the 5.75% starting the next paycheck and that she would get me the paperwork for the 401k for the next enrollment period. At that point my salary would be reduced back to the original salary and the 5.75% contributions to the 401k would begin. 

The fact is that I still have student loans and some of them are at 6.8% interest rates. My understanding is that it is in my best long term and short term financial interests to be paying everything I can towards my student loans UNLESS I have access to an investment that has returns greater than the interest on my loans, in this case 6.8%. Essentially, if there is contribution matching the 401k would be worthwile but since there is not then paying my student loans down with the extra money makes the most sense. 

I sent the office manager an email after reviewing the documents for enrollment and asking about contribution matching to clarify and she said that the company contributes 5.75% and that anything else is my money I am choosing to put into the 401k, but if my salary is going to be reduced by 5.75% to cover the cost of the company contributing 5.75% then in reality the company isn't contributing the 5.75%, I am. 

Hopefully this was clear enough for everyone to follow.  

Essentially I want to know if anyone has any better understanding of this. Maybe I should be contributing the 5.75% and I am wrong in my understanding that I am better served paying down the student loans but any information about legal requirements, opting out, or what my best move might be would be absolutely appreciated.",finance,1403624332

In June 2013 I graduated with my Master of Architecture at 22 years old. I now still owe about $50k to my government issued loans. I currently work full time at a firm (making about 40k a year), and part-time working retail once a weekend to supplement that income.

This is my monthly regimen:

STUDENT LOANS:
1) I pay the required amount of about $300 to my government issued student loans mid-month, which is automatically distributed among each type (type based on interest rate)
2) I pay an extra $300 a month to the government issued loan with the highest interest rate at the end of the month

RETIREMENT:
3) I contribute 15% of my bi-weekly paychecks (about $500 per month) to an employer sponsored Roth 401k (this is not matched)
4) I contribute $50 to a separate Roth IRA each month

Let's ignore all the other things I pay (rent, food, gas, phone bills, car insurance, etc.), but assume I am fairly frugal with these.

My hope is that the money I give to my retirement account will earn more interest than the loans I owe. So, once I reach my late 20's/early 30's I'll have paid off my student loans entirely and I should also be able to contribute a smaller percentage of my paychecks to my retirement account.

We are both 22 years old. My girlfriend has been able to secure around $18,000 per year from scholarships and grants so she is pretty much set. I, on the other hand, have very wealthy parents who are unwilling to assist me in paying for college(My father is willing to cosign loans, though). As a result, I don't qualify for federal grants and I have to find some way to support myself while living at college and paying $14,000 per year for tuition. My girlfriend is getting a full ride for tuition and will be recieving extra financial support so she has mentioned that she might be able to pay for more than half of our food and housing costs.

Let's say I end up taking a full 4 years to complete my degree. According to the net price calc for miami, I will have to come up with $120,000. That is a huge amount of money to come up with even if I do work part time as a student.

**Here are the basics of my situation**

• 22 year old male

• $14,000 saved up

• Planning on graduating with a degree in Chem. engineering

personalfinance,"High credit utilization, considering peer to peer loan","High interest CC debt, considering a peer to peer loan to lower interest rates and create lower utilization.

-3 CCs totalling about 8k. One is at 0% apr until early summer 2015. About 90% credit utilization. Other two cards at 22% apr.

-1 student loan, 2.2k @ 4.25%

-Total debt just over 10k

-credit karma says credit score is 702, a different score recently says 679

-Last years income 18k

-Expected to be less this year, my work is seasonal and ends in August. I plan to look for more work of course, but can't guarantee much (will take a cashier job if necessary). About $500-1000 in savings by end of seasonal work in August (expected).

I'm considering three options: 
1) keep plugging away. My debt has just maintained the last year, no increases. 

2) getting a peer loan to cover all CC debt. This will result in a slightly higher overall monthly payment (as compared to three minimums), which is a concern with unstable income. But interest rates around half of current would save a ton of money, as well as lower my CC utilization (hopefully improve credit score too). 

3) getting a fourth CC now to create a lower credit utilization, and then using that better credit score to get a better loan option in 2-3 months. Chances are I won't receive a better interest rate on the card, so no use doing a balance transfer. The 4th card would add to my number of CC lines though which could be good for my score before getting a loan tho.

I'd like to think I'll make more money one day but right now I don't see it happening. I have a great relationship with someone who is generous and supportive but I personally feel guilty of this. I hope to relieve myself of the debt so I can contribute more to our lifestyle.

Big concern: if I open a new CC to lower my utilization before applying for the loan, even if I don't transfer any balance over, will the new age of my account have a greater impact on my credit score versus going from 3 accounts to 4 accounts?

One idea I had was to purchase their home from them on mortgage. They then pass the proceeds back to me. I use the proceeds to pay off the mortgage on my own house as well as a large chunk of theirs, and effectively lower my interest rate and minimum payment in the process. They effectively become my tenants, with their rent covering property taxes and repairs.

personalfinance,Question about the affect multiple credit cards have on your score/cc history (CANADA),"Hello /r/personalfinance

About 8 years ago I screwed up with my credit card and it eventually went to collections. Eventually I struck a deal with the agency and paid the debt off at a reduced amount. For several years after I had no credit card, and then applied for one with a low limit, and was approved. The limit never increased ($800) and I wasn't happy with the customer service (Card A) or the annual fee, so I applied for a credit card at my current bank and was also approved (Card B).

I have made my payments on time and every year Card B has increased my limit (currently $5500) and just recently upgraded me to a better card with more rewards.

A few days ago, I received a letter for a pre-approved card from another card company for ($3000). I thought it over and liked the interest rates so called ahead and accepted the offer. I explicitly asked if there would be a hard credit check in order to accept the offer and get the card, and they answered ""No there will be no hard credit check"". So I accepted it over the phone, the played a recorded ""terms"" message and then asked if I understood the terms, which I did. They told me I would have to go to a local bank branch and pick-up the card in 7 - 10 days.

I started thinking about it and I don't need the card as far as I can tell, and I figure three cards probably isn't smart for my score. Will there be a hit on my credit score if I called the pre-approved card company and told them I was no longer interested? They said no hard credit check is performed, I didn't sign anything yet, but I did agree to some terms over the phone.

Also, is Card B likely to ""punish"" (ie. lower my credit limit) because I accepted the pre-approved one assuming i continued to make all my payments on time? 

Thanks for the info. Please keep in mind I live in Canada, not the U.S. A free credit report I had mailed to me last week showed my first two cards as R1 and my student debt as paid in full as agreed. I just purchased an Equifax credit score check and i am in the 690's.

Bitcoin,How the US Postal Service could make a killing with Bitcoin and decentralized markets.,"I've been thinking about an idea which could be huge for an organization such as the USPS.  Or FedEx, UPS or DHL for that matter.  The biggest problem with buying or selling anything online is trusting the other party not to screw you over.  If I send you money how do I know you are going to send me the goods?

In the cash world, you don't have the same issues.  I hand you the cash and you hand me the goods.  Unless you run away or try to bash me over the head I can be reasonably confident that I'm getting what I paid for because I can see it before I relinquish the dough and even size you up before committing.  Yet in the online world it often feels like you never know when your going to get a virtual bashing over the head.

The most common solutions to the online trust problem are escrow and reputation systems but both are fraught.  An escrow provider has no way of really knowing if either the seller or buyer are lying and resolving disputes can be costly.  Reputation systems can be effective but still have to deal with unknown users and reputation slanderers.

So how can USPS solve this dilemma?  By providing a service where the seller supplies a description of the goods in a standardized format, then USPS physically examines the goods before taking possession.  You make the payment, which USPS can confirm on the blockchain, and receive delivery.  Of course you would pay a fee for this service but it would be part of your shipping costs and would make online transactions with strangers as safe, perhaps safer, than using cash in person.

What do you think?  Does this have legs?  Feel free to shoot holes in my idea.  I'm curious if this has been tried and what were the results.  Seems like a great way to save the USPS from extinction and at the same time enable decentralized crypto-currency markets.",cryptocurrency,1403675464

However, I applied for the forgiveness and Sallie Mae denied it without explanation. I'm not sure how to navigate this. I'm hoping someone else has been in a similar situation and successfully had loans forgiven or at least found some kind of resolve or solution.

Any useful input would be sincerely appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1403700569

personalfinance,I'm 22 and want to get everything straightened out. Two car loans and a bit of school loans.,"Hi Reddit, I wanted to jump on here and ask a few questions because I've seen this subreddit be very helpful to some people.   Let me start out by saying I'm not in a bad place, I just want to do better.  

For what I owe, I have a few doctor bills that I'm working on paying off as I find out I have them.  I also have about 7k in Student Loans, of which about 2,050 is unsubsidized.  I took the subsidized loans as much as I could.  I also paid out of pocket for some classes when I could.

I also have two car loans, one for my first car that has about 3,300 left on it at about a 13% interest rate for 4 years and I'm over two years in (only place to give me loan, and my first major credit purchase).  

The second loan is for my second car and it's at about 22,000 and a 3.25% interest rate five and a half year loan, and just got this car about 2 months ago.  This car isn't expensive for what it is, but it's a little more than I did want to pay.  I believe it was repoed from the last owner and only had 8.5k miles on it so it was actually a very good deal.  

The last time I checked, I had a credit score just under 700.  I know this can differ from place to place, but that's what I got back when they did the checks for the second loan.  When they did this loan, I only gave one dealership the permission to check my credit and make an application for credit.  

So for some questions...  Should I pay off the first loan first, just to get it out of the way?  Or should I start putting money on the second loan and keep paying the monthly payment for the first loan.  The student loans are in deferment because I'm still taking 6 credit hours of classes and my current employer is paying for them.  As long as I keep taking half-time towards my second degree i shouldn't have to pay them back as they are federal loans.  

I was also thinking about applying for the Amazon Rewards Visa so I can use it to buy gas that I normally do with my debit card and pay it off at the end of the month.  It would help the credit rating and I'd also get two times the points on the gas purchase for use on amazon, in case I need or want to buy something such as a book for a class.  

If anyone else has any tips that I didn't think of asking I'd appreciate it too.

Thanks!",finance,1403704099

personalfinance,Markets At All Time Highs! Where Do I Invest?,"With asset prices at record highs where does one invest their money these days? As investors, we seek to buy low and sell high which makes this a particularly challenging environment. I’m reminded of Warren Buffett’s famous quote: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Is this the time to be fearful while greed carries the day? I’m not sure, but what I can say is that, as a long term investor, I’m sticking to my investment plan and my short-term financial goals.

My focus this year has been on trying to eliminate non-deductible mortgage debt. This will clean up my liabilities on my net worth statement, leaving only a HELOC that is used to invest in Canadian eligible dividend stocks and where the interest on that loan is tax deductible. Getting rid of that mortgage debt is an important milestone on the road to financial freedom. In fact, Moneysense’s Jonathan Chevreau has stated that “the foundation of financial independence is a paid-for home.” Having the mortgage paid off will dramatically increase my monthly cash-flow and I’ll be in a strong position to take advantage of any market correction. After all, CASH IS KING as they say.

Given where the markets are today, I’m reluctant to borrow any more money to invest at these levels. While the availability of cheap money does give investors the opportunity to borrow at record low interest rates, on the flip side, once rates start to rise, it can put them at risk of margin calls if their stocks drop in price. I think that borrowing beyond one’s means is particularly risky nowadays. In my view, although cheap money is tempting, it is important for people to know their limit and borrow within it.

What I have been doing lately is rebalancing my holdings in my RRSP. I’ve sold off some of my TD e-series funds (Canadian Index, US Index and International Index) to keep each of them at their target allocation of 20%. I continue to make automatic purchases of e-series funds in my RRSP and stocks in my DRIP accounts. I do so for a few reasons. First, it takes time to setup automatic purchases so I don’t want to go through the hassle of stopping and starting them. Second, my dollar cost averages (DCA) are well below the current values of these assets so I’m comfortable with my holdings. Finally, the amounts aren’t all that much so I’m not concerned about “buying high” and I always have the option of rebalancing my holdings.",finance,1403713889
personalfinance,"Pay off car loan, or sell and buy a new vehicle? [Details inside]","2008 Honda Fit, 145 k miles. Worth $4,622 aprx. 


$3100 owed on it. 


My loan is finished in March 2015. 



Because I was commuting I put a lot of miles on the car, while I'm now living in the same city I work in, now I'm considered about higher maintenance costs in the future. 


My bank recommended I sell the car, and pay off the auto loan (25% interest rate :/) and buy a new vehicle cash/apply for a new loan. I think this seems like a reasonable suggestion, as I currently owe less than it's worth, and I'm afraid by the time its paid off, it will have depreciated so much in value trading it in/selling will be worthless.  


My spouse says this is just playing into the trap of buying a new car as soon as one's paid off, idk. 


My other option would be just paying off the loan as quickly as possible, and driving it for as long as possible. 


Some added details: I don't really want another auto loan/car payment, so if I did buy a new car I would buy something used with low miles, and preferably pay cash, which I'd save up for. 



**Edit** - For those wondering, yes my interest rate is outrageous, we had been pre-approved to refinance, but our CU evidently did not approve it. 

We bought the car at a time when I was driving 65 miles a day in a veritable death trap, no credit history and not enough cash to not have a loan. It sucks, but was the only option.

personalfinance,Making use of subsidised student loans to build a buffer for after university (NL),"There is an opportunity for Dutch students in The Netherlands to take out student loans with very favourable terms and generally low interest rates, and to save it up and use it after having finished studying as a down payment on a house or some other large expenditure. As a student though I don't have that much experience with financial products though I'm pretty in touch with formal and legal mumbo jumbo in general, so I'd like your opinion on this plan.

Firstly, the student loan system in The Netherlands is changing in that it's becoming more flexible but nobody really knows exactly what the precise terms are going to become, so I'll use the old data and hopefully it will show that even in the old situation this can be a worthwhile idea. Right now, you have 15 years after you stop studying (assuming you stop in time) to pay back any loans you have, and if you haven't by then, the rest of the debt is cleared (this is going to be 35 years). Of course there is a minimum monthly payment based on your income, and it only applies when you make over 80% minimum wage.

The maximum amount of money you can loan depends on your living and studying situation but it would be between about 500 and 900 euro's per month. The interest rates are fixed for 5 years starting the year after you stop receiving money, and have been as follows for the past years:

    Start       End         Interest for 5 years
    01-01-2014	31-12-2018	0,81 %
    01-01-2013	31-12-2017	0,6 %
    01-01-2012	31-12-2016	1,39 %
    01-01-2011	31-12-2015	1,50 %
    01-01-2010	31-12-2014	2,39 %

If you don't need this money, and you would take it and put it in a savings account or an investment portfolio you would almost certainly make a nice profit, plus end your studies with a nice buffer for kickstarting your working life. 

For me personally, here's my situation. I'm 23 and have 2-3 more years to study before earning my Masters degree in Computer Science in Eindhoven. We are practically guaranteed a decent job at the time, and I have no reason to believe I wouldn't make decent money immediately after finishing university. I have a part-time job that covers all my expenses, around 800-1200 euro per month on average. I am kind of entrepreneurially spirited so I would be interested in putting these student loans into some investment fund to maybe use later to start a business if needed or to keep for when I want to buy a house or something. An investment fund that appeals to me is ""Robeco ONE Offensief"" which according to objective information required by law is a high-risk fund (6 on a scale of 1-7) which started towards the end of 2012 and grew 11.7% over 2013 with the only fee being 0.78% and no restrictions on putting money in or getting it out (but they advise you to want to keep it there for at least 7 years).

In short, it seems like the generally bad practice of using money you don't have to invest is offset by the fact that losing the money entirely is pretty much no problem, and the potential upsides are pretty significant. What do you think?",finance,1403718276
personalfinance,Paying down mortgage vs. investing windfall (CA),"Background: I'm 36 currently have an outstanding line of credit on my house of 175k (assessed at 370k so about 190k in equity), 120k in mutual funds, and about 30k to 40k in other investments.  I have no other debt, and the line of credit on my house is at 1% because I work for an FI that offers it as a benefit.  I also co-own a rental property.  This is a ""burner account"" as I don't want to associate my finances with my other reddit account.

Looks like I'm going to sell my rental property and pocket about 65 to 70k (after tax) because the person I co-own it with wants out.  I'm trying to figure out what I should do with this money - should I pay down my house or invest this money?

If I put the money towards my mortgage, I'll likely be mortgage free by age 40, which would be really nice. I currently put down about 2500/month towards the LOC, which would be freed up once the mortgage is paid off.  If I invest the money, I could earn 2% risk free, but I get taxed on the interest at 40%, so it seems almost not worth it.  I'm leaning towards something relatively low risk, as I have quite a bit of exposure to the stock market with my mutual funds and investments.  Also, I live in a country that doesn't allow me to write off the interest on my personal property, so to me it sounds wise to pay of the mortgage, but the low interest rate on my LOC makes me wonder if that's the best option.  

What's the best choice here?  Is there a calculation to do to figure out the benefits of a low mortgage vs. investing?  Also, are there any other low-risk investments (other GIC's) that I should look at?",finance,1403718386

I currently own nothing but my personal possessions (including some rare musical equipment) and have no debt except what I put on my line of credit which is paid each month so not to incur any interest.

My mother passed away recently and my father is now in the ICU. Based on my knowledge of their arrangements, I will be the sole inheritor since I am an only child. I currently have durable power of attorney.

I have access to the lawyer who made my mother and father's legal arrangements and an accountant who has worked for my family off and on and  was a former colleague of my father's. They both seem capable and willing to work for me as well.

I have a lot of questions and not sure where to begin. I was hoping for some guidance on what I should be mindful for:

*Past and future taxes

I also owe my family members $8k and girlfriend $3k - these don't have interest, so I'm not in a rush to pay these off.

gadgets,Drone idea? Plausibility?,"Hey r/gadgets

I may be in the wrong sub for this, but I have had an idea for a little while and I want to see if you guys think its remotely plausible

Backstory: I just graduated high school and Im heading to a fairly prestigious tech school to major in Aerospace Engineering and possibly minoring in robotics

So. About a year ago I fell in love with drones. Ive been scavaging the internet for innovation with drones, but sadly all ive seen is an amazon marketing ploy and go pros strapped to remote control helicopters. I had this perhaps ridiculous idea. Can we make planes such as fedex delivery and any sort of air cargo a drone? Its certainly a bit more complicated than that but why the fuck not? My idea is making them smaller and faster, perhaps shipping about 1000 lbs of cargo cross country (US about 2500 miles) in 4 hours? It would boost the economy like crazy too. So am I a crazy high school grad or do i have a golden idea? Dont be afraid to be overly critical, thats exactly what id like to see",technology,1403743572

personalfinance,Can my tax forms be changed without my permission??,"Hey reddit. Hoping you guys can help me out here. 

Can my company change my tax forms without my permission?? For the last 6 months, they stopped taking out the extra $ I had asked them to take out every check and I never told them too. I never changed any papers so did my job do it? And is it legal?? 

Sorry, here's some background. 

So I work in California for a rental car company. I began working for company ""x"" about a year ago, in May of 2013. When I began working at this company, I filled out all my tax forms like you would for any job. I filed under single status, with no dependents. Under the option for them to take extra money every check, i decided to give them an extra 50$ per paycheck (because I was getting paid pretty good, twice a month, and wanted a big tax refund). So 7 months go by and everything's just fine. An extra 100$ a month is being given to taxes. So when I did taxes that year, although I only worked about 7 months, I got a nice big refund!  
Exactly what I wanted, everything was great. I loved it. Planned on continuing doing that. 

In January however, company ""X"" was bought by company ""y"". A long, awkward, assimilation occurs. We stay as company x, but we're changing all our policies and rules to match with company y. In company y, our pay periods changed from every 2 weeks, to every week. Our company never gave us new forms to sign or fill out, and I was never told that anything in our pay was going to change besides getting our checks every week. I thought this meant I was now going to be giving 200$ a month instead of 100$ and honestly didn't mind very much. (I know it may not be the best way to handle my taxes, but everybody's different.) but they haven't taken anything extra out in the last 6 months! I asked my boss about it and he said it was because of the whole system change, that it was my responsibility to change all my tax forms. I asked him -if it was legal to change my federal income tax forms without my permission and he 
 Said it has nothing to do with being legal or not?

Can anyone help clear this up for me or give me some advice??",finance,1403753549

I've always been a good debtor--but should go nuclear and stop paying or declare bankruptcy to get the debt down?","Longtime redditor using a throwaway account due to deep embarrassment about my situation.  This is my cakeday thread. :/

I spent two years being depressed and with an income of less than $5000/year.  This resulted in $14000 of credit card debt with APR ranging from 13%-23%, with the largest balance ($5000) being on the 23% card.  I also have $16K of student loans at an interest rate of 6%.  My income is now $30K/year.  I have no savings, no retirement funds, no car, no house, nothing of worth.

I've always been a diligent debtor.  Always paid everything on time and was worried about the effects of default on my credit score.  But I am feeling overwhelmed with the amount of debt I have to pay off and the amount of money going to interest.  I have a high utilization and have not been able to get any 0% interest or balance transfer offers.  I have called the credit card companies and nobody is budging on dropping the interest rate.  My current credit score is 680.

I am going to be entering grad school and have no plans to buy a car, house, anything for a while.  I have no family to support nor do I see one in the near future.  I'm trying to figure out ways to get out from under this.  I see a few options:

* continue to helplessly throw money at credit cards, get additional jobs, etc
* bankruptcy
* debt consolidation loan (though I've read that's not necessarily a great idea either, and it's not like I have anything to offer in equity)
* I read a comment in one of these threads that recommended dropping all payments, saving the money I'd put towards payments, waiting 180 days, and then attempt to negotiate with collections to pay off each debt for lower than the original amount owed.

Does anyone have recommendations?  Ideas?

The problem is I am upside down over $4k on the car (a 2012 Honda Accord) since I'm only about 3 months into the loan, so I'd rather not trade it in and pay off the difference out of pocket.  I am prepared to do so if I need to, but I'd just rather not.

This family member of mine has decent credit but also a limited credit history and thus would not be able to get the interest rate that I got on the vehicle (1.99%).  Her and I have verbally agreed that she will take over payments with the title remaining in my name until the vehicle is fully paid off.  

We also agreed to write up a contract to protect both of our interests.  These are the key points I have thought of that need to be in the contract:

* Payment terms (i.e., due date, amount, etc.).
* Consequences for late payments: I am considering putting something in the contract that says if late on 3 or more payments at any point of the contract I have the right to cancel the contract and they will have no further interest in the vehicle.
* Something that says they are responsible for all repairs, both regular tuneups and major repairs.
* Something that says they must maintain sufficient insurance (with details of exactly what coverages).  
* I am also considering adding in an 'out' clause that will allow them to cancel the contract at any time.  Then when the vehicle is disposed of at the time any gain/loss will be split according to percentage time of ownership.

My questions:

1. Is there a better way to go about doing this?
2. Should I also maintain my current insurance?
3. What is my potential liability exposure on a deal like this?

personalfinance,What's the best way to go about asking a credit card company if they'd lower your interest rate?,"I'm 29. I opened the card (we will call it Card A) when I was 18 as my 'emergency' card. Since then, over the 11 years, the balance grew and I missed just a small handful of payments, so the interest rate climbed to 29.9% and the credit line grew from $150 to almost $20k (the balance was NEVER even close to getting that high, FYI)

Now that I'm making good money, I'm paying it off rapidly. I opened a second, interest free card (Card B), and I've been doing balance transfer of $2k at a time (Card B has a lower available balance), paying that off in usually three months or so. Card A is now down to about $3k... I would expect to have that paid off by the end of this year with this plan. 

I just found out today that I've run to the end of the 'offer' that Card B was giving me and they will no longer do balance transfers. Bummer. Good news is that the card is at a $0 balance. 

Now I need to do my lump payments directly onto Card A. I feel like I get no where when I do though because the interest rate is so high.

personalfinance,Budgeting For Potential Scenarios,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I have a dilemma and am looking for some advice.

I stopped renting a year ago and moved back into my parents. Since then I have saved $30,000. My goal was always to purchase a house and rent out whatever additional rooms, but over the last few days of house hunting I've discovered that the homes that were in my initial price range are a little rough around the corners and would leave me relying on my room mates for my saving.

**[I have my current budget in a google spreadsheet. Where you can take a look at the budget that I'm using](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1On-FpXD7rOAUtb92Wn1avOOMUp3QnlByWaNeMD4UFdU/edit?usp=sharing)**

Here's a Breakdown:

**Income:**
$3104 / Month after taxes / health insurance

**Expenses:**
Car: $200
Car Insurance: $94.22
Phone: $88.74 - Necessary due to work.
Gym: $68.92 - I would be very uncomfortable getting rid of my gym membership.
Gas: $250 (I have a very long commute and fill up about 4 times a month)
Food: $200
Student Loans: $766.92 - will be paid off in 2020. Currently at a rate of 4%. My grandparents refinanced my student loan debt in 2010 so that it had a lower interest rate and I'm paying it off in 10 years rather than 25

**Saving: $1426**

I'm going to assume that the utilities would be around $500 / month.

I was quoted the following price yesterday:
$1010 / month on a $150k fixed rate mortgage @ 4.125%

This leaves me at -$78$ a month if I don't go out and have fun or do anything like that.

personalfinance,"With today's low interest rates, is it a good idea to buy a car in cash?","If I wait until the end of this year, I would be able to buy a new vehicle, a minivan, in cash. According to Bankrate, current auto loan rates for a new purchase is between 3-4%. I work full time and have a steady part-time job. The income from the full time work is enough to pay the bills and funding my retirement in full. The income I earn from my 'steady part-time job' goes towards my kids' extra-curricular activities as well as to a fund for hopefully an early/ cushy retirement. 

I can probably finance the purchase and pay the loan from the part time work, but don't really want to this- the hours are long and tiring, something I might dread to do when I 'have' to do it to pay for the car loan. But then again, financing the purchase will free up some cash I can put towards more investments. 

I should add that paying for the vehicle in cash would not be dipping into my emergency fund. 

So PF, what are your thoughts? Just pay for the vehicle out right? Or put a big down payment and finance?

personalfinance,Reigning in Impulse Spending / Debt Overview,"Hi everyone -- first post (so let's see if I can do this succinctly the first time and in the correct forum, apologies if incorrect). 

Overview of financial situation:
My personal student loan total - 
$5,000 personal loan, monthly payment $70 (I pay $100)
$70,000 federal loan, monthly (Income Based) payment $70 for this calendar year. 
1 credit card with about $3,000 balance.  

My spouse is finishing their degree, has 1 year left (planned graduation June 2015) and I think will have about $25,000 student debit in total -- some private, most Federal.

I expect next June our grand total student debt will be about $100k; which I realize is A LOT. A HUGE amount that feels a bit crushing when I look at it. 

I am not employed in my field of study, but am employed full-time with stock benefits and health insurance, my spouse is full time student. We have a child and a dog so month to month we're able to cover *most* of our expenses with my income and what's left over from the student loans that come in with each quarter.

The plan is for my entire paycheck to be directed towards debt repayment and my spouses eventual paycheck will cover our monthly living expenses. But that won't be happening for another 12 months. In the meantime, I'm trying to balance everything and make the best decisions to get us through the next year. 

So -- for that overview, I feel I'm fairly aware of our debt load, the mountain that is looming for us to climb will require planning - planning and more planning. But -- awareness doesn't always equate to the correct actions, at least for me it doesn't.

Now --down to the real nitty gritty of my question. I have some stock that will be maturing in a few months. About $10,000 or so. I had thought about paying off my private loan and the credit card bill. Or at least the private loan, and then fully funding a Roth IRA for the 2014 year or putting it in some other harder to get to savings account to have an Emergency Fund of sorts.

My issue is -- I don't want any funds to be readily available (such as an easily accessible savings account, or even stock that is able to be cashed in). We've been students for such a long time and so many things need upgrading/replacing that I'm afraid of spending it on *things* and perpetuating a debt-ridden lifestyle. I don't want to exacerbate our financial situation further than it is. 

So -- about the $10,000. Yes, I could leave it where it is but I honestly don't have the self-control in the moment not to cash in and spend it on some expense that pops up. I would prefer to diversify by funding a separate, long-term account and/or paying off some current debts.

I get confused knowing the ""right"" thing to do that is going to have the best long term effect.",finance,1403805046
stocks,Market Commentary (6/26/14),"Today, I wanted to dish out some market commentary…..

ENTIRELY my opinion and I hope that you are able to form your own.
 
Once again, I’m hearing the impending doom that is right around the corner. The market is going to crash and it is apparently inevitable. It’s right around the corner, any minute now the market is going to crash….

Well, this seems to have been the consensus since 2009 and I’m still not convinced. The idea that the market is going to crash “any day now” was ramped up in early 2013. That was a year and a half ago, and yet we just keep going higher and higher. The “bubble” that the fed is supposedly inflating, the one that is supposed to burst any minute has yet to burst. When is this inevitable market crash going to come??? 

I’m not saying that it won’t happen, because by all means there are many factors that are pointing to the POSSIBILITY of a downturn, however, it is YET to happen. In my humble opinion, I don’t see why the market can’t keep going higher from current levels. Stocks might seem “expensive” but by historical measures they are not necessarily fully valued, meaning there is room to go higher. Inflation seems to be in line with what the fed wants (finally), QE is on the same course that most market participants expect it to be and unemployment is dropping, right? 

So what seems to be the issue?

There are of course hundreds of issues that you can dig through to try and justify an imminent downturn, but are they relevant? I believe that right now the reason most participants are calling for a downturn is only because we have reached a new level. They believe what goes up must come down, and the down part should be sometime soon. The only concern that I have is rising interest rates and the possibility of investors moving money out of stocks and into safer interest bearing instruments once they become more attractive. 

Maybe they have become accustomed to higher risk and higher return in equities so maybe they won’t want to dip back into bonds? Only time will tell. Rising interest rates shouldn’t be a concern until at least the first quarter of 2015. That’s when the glory days of low interest will end; POSSIBLY! 

The main take away from all of this is that you need stay versatile with your portfolio. If the market does decide to materialize on this “imminent doom” that has been around for over 4 years, you should be able to adapt to those conditions! There are plenty of ways to hedge from a downturn, and there are even more ways to make money on the way down. 

Be versatile and do your homework!

Happy trading.

Bitcoin,A valid argument if you were to be arrested for selling Bitcoin,"As some know, there was a person who met up with his customer to sell a Bitcoin. It ended up being a federal agent arresting him JUST FOR SELLING THE COIN! Now, I'm going to set up a scenario.

You go on a forum, and there's someone in your area wanting to do an in-person transaction. You agree to do it. You go to the location, exchange the money and then the Bitcoin. But wait! You're now in handcuffs, being told you're under arrest.

As you can see, this is bad. Who's to say this couldn't happen to you. So, the day of the trial, this is the very valid argument you should give:

""As I was arrested for selling a digital item, why am I being charged with money-related charges. Bitcoin, the item I sold, has been classified by the United States Government as PROPERTY. Not CURRENCY. Why should I need a money transmitter license for selling a digital item. If this is the case, why are we not arresting everyone that bought an old bike from someone on Craigslist.""

Obviously, this is 100% true. You still might need to present legal documents on the subject of Bitcoin being property.

personalfinance,All of my student loans are under control except for one,"Background:  Graduated from a small university, bachelors degree in Mathematics, currently have $55,000 in student loans.  I have a job in the Midwest paying ~$45,000 per year.


I have a specific issue that I hope you may be able to give advice on.  I have a total of 13 student loans for varying amounts and interest rates.  There is a group of 8, a group of 4, and a single loan by itself.  I am in the process of paying 12 of the 13.  This issue is in regards to the final loan, 13/13.


I must admit, I made mistakes along the way and my loans went into default.  I have been able to rehabilitate them and am currently scheduled to make regular payments which I am now currently capable of doing due to a recent raise.  However, I have come to a situation where I don't know what is best to do.


The last loan was done directly through my University.  I was contacted earlier last month and informed that the loan was referred to a lawyer and a lawsuit will follow.  The amount is for ~$3500.00.  I contacted the lawyer, and they referred me to the dept collector.  When I contacted the dept collector with intent to start repayment, the referred me back to the lawyer.  I in turn contacted the lawyer again and expressed my intent to repay the loan in potions, to which they replied they were not interested and would continue with legal procedures unless the full sum was paid.  They will be filing the suit on July 2nd.  They explained to me that should the process continue I would likely experience a garnishment of wages.


I have since contacted studentloans.gov in an attempt to refinance my loans and was informed that the process would take 45-60 days due to the loan being in default, well past the July 2nd deadline I'm presented with.


I do not have family or friends that are capable of assisting me in this manner in an effort to pay up front.  Does anyone have any advice as to what would be the best action?  I have considered contacting other independent/private loaners in order to pay of the loan holder and start making payments with some entity which will allow payment over time.  I have considered letting the wage garnishment simply go through and pay them immediately with everything I can earn until the issue is resolved, but I'm afraid about how it will negatively affect my future in regards to my standing with my company.


Please share with me if you have any experience or advice.  I've realized the mistakes I've made, and I'm trying to correct them.  I'm almost done, but this issue is larger than what I can handle at the moment.  Many thanks for all input.

personalfinance,Figuring out where/whom I owe money to?,"Hello!

So a little information about me:

I went to college, accrued debts via student loans, had a bank account at a credit union where I took out an approximate 2,000 dollar loan, I owe a phone company about 200 dollars, and there may certainly be a few other businesses I owe money to that I'm forgetting about right now. This was all between the ages of 18 to 21.

I'm 27 years old and getting married in September, and I want to figure out exactly where I owe money. I have never received a call from a credit collector, but have received pieces of mail from them in the past. I've always scoffed it off, but now am dead set on paying my debts to where I owe them. The only problem is I don't know where or how to begin doing this. Is there a free way that I can see exactly where I owe money? What exactly would be the best way for me to go about doing this? I want to get this details worked out before I get married so that it is one less thing to think about!

personalfinance,College student credit card with low personal income?,"Right off the bat, let me just say that my purpose in trying to get a credit card is basically just to build a credit history. I have absolutely no intention of carrying a balance at all. My parents struggle with a mountain of credit card debt and I have no desire to join them.

I'm a 20-year-old college student and am considering getting a credit card, primarily to build good credit but I wouldn't mind some sort of rewards program. I expect to make around $1200 this year (not much, I know) and currently have about $1000 in my main savings and checking account (I believe I have another savings account with around $1500 in it, but it hasn't been touched in about 10 years) and another $1000 in my brokerage account.

I'm looking for a card that will approve me even though my only actual source of income at the moment is summer jobs, which vary from year to year and by compensation. I don't care if I have a really low credit limit (even $100 would be fine), but I just want to make sure that I don't get declined for a card and have the resulting credit score hit when I don't have any credit history to begin with.

As for my family financial situation, my parents have mediocre credit (they don't miss payments, but they pay about $1000 a month on credit cards and are fairly close to the limits on most of their cards). They're in the process of transferring the balance onto a 0% interest card, paying $12k off this year, and then repeating the process next year (to pay off the majority of the balance, which I think is somewhere around $35k at this point). They make about $115k a year, but that's not as much as it sounds because we live in an expensive part of the country.

In case it affects my credit score, I take the full federal subsidized student loan every year, but do not have any unsubsidized loans (and do not expect to have any).

Are there any cards that would fit my situation? I checked NerdWallet and the ones that sounded most promising are CapitalOne's Journey card (I have a checking account with Capital One, though I only have like $40 in there because I only opened it to have a local bank near my university, since my main accounts are with a credit union at home) and the Discover It card. I'll probably be studying abroad in the spring semester, so those two not having foreign transaction fees was a nice bonus. Above all though, I want a card that will definitely approve me and that will allow me to build a great credit score for when I go to buy a car or a house down the road.

One other factor that may or may not come into play: I just started an internship with a financial services company which required a background check and an FCRA disclosure authorization. Since I'm assuming they did a credit history check on me, would it be better to hold off a few months on applying for a credit card so I'm not having two checks run on me in a short period of time?",finance,1403832291

personalfinance,Unfiled taxes... help please.,"OK, let me preface this by saying that I know what an idiot I am.  But I'd really appreciate any insight from redditors.  

I was a graduate student and non-resident alien in the USA for 6 years. I received a fellowship and some wages from teaching, all subject to federal and state tax withholding.  In my first year, I filed a tax return, but something went wrong when I applied for my ITIN (taxpayer number for those without a SS number) and I never got one.  This made filing next year more complex and ... I never filed again.  I am fairly sure I do not owe taxes: all my income was subject to withholding, and I think I would have been due a refund. But there was one year when I was living in another state, and I think I owe taxes in that state.  I would like to just file the returns and regularise my affairs, but I'm so scared of penalties.  I have never received a demand or message of any kind from the IRS and now do not live in the USA.  

Are the authorities basically going to forget about small fry like me (I never earned more than like $26,000)?

personalfinance,"IBR, PSLF, and parent plus - which loan to pay off first?","•	My federal loan paid under income-based repayment.

•	My parent plus is being paid down at standard 10 year.

•	Wife’s parent plus being paid down at standard 10 year.

•	Wife’s federal loan is what we’re attacking, paid down more than 15k this past year.


My federal loan under IBR currently has a $0 monthly payment. My work counts under Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and after 120 qualifying monthly payments remaining balance is paid. So it makes sense to pay minimum qualifying IBR payments until I hit 120 payments.

Currently we’re paying down extra on my wife’s consolidated federal loan but I’m wondering if we should be going after the parent plus loans first. As I understand it, my IBR is calculated based upon our joint income AND our joint debt, which would look at both of our federal loans but of course not parent plus loans. My concern is that if we continue and pay off my wife’s federal loan first, we’re setting ourselves up for a higher IBR payment for the next X years until we hit 120 qualifying payments on my federal. The alternative would be to pay a standard 10 year plan on wife’s federal and to focus on paying down both of our parent plus loans, which have also 1%-2% higher interest rates.

I hate the idea of changing our focus because we’ve made so much progress on my wife’s loan. The idea of taking one loan payment out of the budget and rolling that amount over into another loan is extremely motivating. 
Am I completely off base here? We also put in 5% of my pay into retirement because agency matches up to 5%.

Unclaimed Deposit Request
Dear Mr. –ErnieMcgee-

The FDIC is in receipt of you unclaimed funds request arising from an account opened in October of 1975. On July 31, 1982, Perpetual American FS&amp;LA merged without government assistance into Perpetual American Bank, FSB; in 1986 they changed their name to Perpetual Savings Bank, FSB. Perpetual Savings Bank, FSB failed and went into receivership on January 10, 1992 and became part of Crestar Bank, who later merged into SunTrust Bank. The Receivership was terminated from FDIC's books on July 1, 2005. When receiverships are terminated under Federal Law 12 U.S.C., 1822(e), (also Pub. L N. 103-44, section 2(b)), unclaimed funds and/or deposits can no longer be claimed. Because the Receivership has been terminated, you may no longer claim any deposit you may have had at the former bank.
You might try contacting SunTrust Bank concerning your account, but it is very doubtful if they will have any record of it.  I do not know any business or financial institution that would carry a dormant account on their book for over 30 years.

personalfinance,Recent small insurance settlement; Not sure where to keep the money and any advice to help us use this to our best advantage.,"Hi PF, Throwaway here.

My Husband and I have recently received a settlement (25k)from an auto accident. This is after all the medical bills have been paid.
I'd like some ideas on where to keep the money(high interest?) and some general ideas about what we should do with it. This money is a windfall for us since we make 38k a year for a family of 5(edit because I forgot my newborn) Before they finally settled we were living paycheck to paycheck with only a little bit of savings each month. 


A little financial background: We have a mortgage, but we have paid cash for our cars. We both work retail, but one of us is always home with the kids to cut costs on daycare. I am working through college, but that has taken a few pauses. 

We have no current debts other than the CC ($2k right now. 1k usual monthly spending that we always pay off and 1k because I negotiated with the hospital to bring a bill down from 1.5k). 

5 years ago, we had just bought our home, I was in school and we had 10k EF. But it has been going down bit by bit for the last few years faster than we can save. We've had a few major costs: babies, (although earlier than we wanted are totally worth it), a good used car and the accident caused quite a dent as we lost wages and had to pay some medical bills because the hospital ignored the lien. We have no EF right now. Maybe 1k in the bank. We both have been with our company 10 years plus, and we have 401k's set at 7% that the company matches. Those have been adjusted and shut off from time to time because of financial needs, so it's not anywhere close where it should be at our ages. I am in my late 20's, he is in his mid 30's.


Things I think we should do with it

* $5k-6k needs to stay liquid as we are expecting to end up with about that after insurance for deductible/coinsurance costs from a recent medical emergency our child had. I can set up a payment plan and keep that money for years as I pay it off, or try to settle with them and just pay the large chunk. Not sure what to do.

* $500-1k to get a full tuneup and fix some issues with our cars. It would be really nice to have a window that rolls down!

* $500ish? My husband who was the one hit in the accident still has trouble walking so we would love to see about special supportive shoes or maybe just some monthly massages to help the muscles. 

* $1k-$6kWe have some issues with our house we have been neglecting such as getting some large trees above the house trimmed and we really could use a new roof since our back porch is leaking. (maybe we should get a heloc for this?)

* $3k Set aside for the kids. 1k each. Either 529's, CD's, Bonds? Not sure. They have no college funds. I want this somewhere we can't touch it. In a few years when they are in school and we are both working full time we will be able to contribute more, but in case something happens, I want them to have at least 1k at graduation.

* $500 blow for him. He did go through several surgeries and all that recovery pain, I think it's only fair. 

I'd love to just invest all of it somewhere secretly and not spend a dime, but I know that if we invest in these things we've been putting off, we will save ourselves money down the road so we really need to do it now. 

I've toyed with the idea of refinancing our home loan to a 15 year. We still owe $96k on it. We have a decent interest rate, and don't pay PMI. If my calculations are correct, it would change our monthly payment by a very small amount. But I'm not 100% sure about this. It depends in whether or not a refi would base the loan amount on the assessed value or the amount we owe. If it's the amount, we are a few K away from the magical 20% that makes the PMI vanish.

We also need an EF. Which for us should be about 10k.

The money isn't going to go far, but I want to use it in the best way possible. Perhaps the best investment really would be to put it towards childcare so we can get college out of the way, but our kids are still so little.

I'm hoping to be left with at least 10k which will just be our EF, but even if that's it, any suggestions on where to store it? I think I want to put it in a high interest account but I'm really not sure where to begin. 

Any ideas, suggestions, advice?

personalfinance,Significant Student Loans - What to do?,"Hi PF,

As the text mentions, I've got pretty significant student loan debt, and am not sure what to do. From what I've gathered, most in this subreddit advocate living like a pauper and putting forth all you've got until it's gone. However, I'm not a young man anymore (did that for many years, and do lead a pretty frugal lifestyle by default) and my SO and I are trying to have children, making the situation potentially even more complex.

I've got about $102k in federal loans (70.5k unsub, 31.5k sub, consolidated @6.8% interest). My wife and I last year filed jointly at about 75k AGI. Our cost of living isn't too far off of our expenses, but we do manage to put away about $300/mo + about 6% into a roth 401K with a (meager) company match. We live in a major metropolitan area, and aren't moving so that really isn't an option for us.

Currently, I'm on IBR repayment plan with about $450/mo, looking to rise as soon as I report this year's taxes. I currently work in special education through a staffing agency. That means that in one more year I'll qualify for the teacher loan forgiveness, meaning up to $17,500 could be forgiven, as well as a potential additional (up to) $5k for an IL program for working in a low-income school. I actually work through an agency, so that may be tricky but the wording is consistently ""at"" and not ""for,"" a qualifying institution, whereas the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) wording is much more strict with ""for a qualifying education agency"" all over the place, and defines it as getting your paycheck through them (i.e. I wouldn't qualify for PSLF, but maybe the other two). Another caveat is I may qualify for the new PAYE program. I received my last disbursement just prior to the cutoff date (Oct. 2010), but consolidated afterward that date and have heard of people successfully petitioning Sallie Mae and getting switched over. That would effectively qualify me for 2-3 years earlier in forgiveness, but may result in a higher tax bomb at the end (and I have no idea how to calculate that).

Currently, I am trying to earn more money by starting a side business, and my wife is transitioning to (potentially) a higher paying job she could do from home (if kids works out, it would obviously be a boon). As I mentioned, we live pretty frugally in general and try to save whenever we can but this loan business is like a dark shadow over me, especially when it comes to big life decisions like having a kid.

Sorry for the wall of text, but what the hell should I do? Just keep on keepin' on with the IBR and maybe pay them off? Switch over to PAYE and start saving up for the (bigger?) tax bomb? Go into hiding and move to a 3rd world country? This is a throwaway as I don't want personal info attached to my primary reddit account, but I'm happy to provide further, more specific details if anyone wants them.

TLDR: I've got pretty hefty student loans and don't know where to go from here. I live frugally but feel like I should start working on a gameplan now to plan for the potential tax bomb.

personalfinance,Advice on starting an IRA (21 year old college student),"Hello everyone, I am about to open up an IRA and wanted to seek some advice before I did so. I have thus far visited a lot of different banks websites to look at rates and also have read up on the pros and cons of Roth IRAs and Traditional IRAs (I think I'm leaning on the side of the Roth). I had some questions I hoped to have answered regarding IRAs, and figured this might be a good place.

I recently had a meeting with someone in a local credit union who offers IRAs. They have variable rate and fixed rate accounts. The fixed rate accounts are CDs, so you buy in for a time until you can start putting in more money. My first question is what everyone's opinion is of those? Their deal is you put in a minimum of $1,000 and you can go up to 60 months. Less than 24 months gets you 0.40%, 24-36 months gets you 0.50%, 36-48 months gets you 0.80%, 48-60 months gets you 1.10%, and 60 months get you 1.4%. This paperwork says the dividends are compounded and credited monthly. It seems like a great deal because of the higher interest rates, but considering you can't put more money in, you can understand my weariness. 

Their variable rate accounts are at 0.20% and the dividends are compounded monthly and credited monthly according to this paperwork. On the phone they told me everyday the interest rate is being applied in some way (sorry if this isn't the best jargon). The minimum required balance is $25, but I would want to put about $500-$1,000. 

What does everyone think of these rates? I have always heard of people talking about 3% interest rates and such on their IRAs and after seeing these rates and doing research, I do not understand how that is possible. Is that when the whole year is added up perhaps? Anyways, I am trying to plan for my future in the bet way possible, trying to put money away and trying to make it grow. I look forward to your responses!",finance,1403891012
economy,Learning Economics...,"Can anyone point me towards a good source for learning about the modern institutions which comprise the domestic(US) &amp; global economy and how they interact with each other?

The main problem I am running into with my unstructured approach towards learning is that I have found mountains of theoretical information but virtually nothing which provides an overview of describing the system in action.

personalfinance,Help! Student loan nightmare.,"Hello PF, I was wondering if you guys can provide me some information/help

I cosigned two student loans when I was in Iraq in 2005, I do not believe I physically signed the paper work since I was in Al Fallujah Iraq, now the two student loans are in default and my step mother is not paying for them. Instead of paying for the loan she spends money on junk. I currently live in Miami Florida and the real estate market makes it so that buying a house with a VA loan is cheaper than actually renting an apartment or a house, therefore I was considering next year purchasing a house. Since those two student loans are in default, and I need a year of good credit history plus a good debt to income ratio it seems it’s an impossible task. Although I only have a credit card which is paid off at the end of the month, taking the two student loans into consideration I do not meet the debt to income ratio requirement. 

I’m wondering if I have any options on how I can possibly get rid of those two student loans, if they are brought up to date can I request to be taken off them?. They have cost me a lot from local police job to federal jobs the federal government.

I just don't know what can be done to get rid of this nightmare, thanks in advance. Have a good day",finance,1403905473

personalfinance,"21 years old, no university degree. Should I?","I am currently working part time in banking. I enjoy my job and I really want to work full time but unfortunately my current job has no room for me. We are already overstaffed, at least 2 people would need to leave in order for me to become a full-timer.

Anyways, my company is allowing me to transfer to a neighbouring city, I just have to wait for a position to become available, which could be one week or one year, it's hard to tell.

I am 20 years old and I don't have a degree. I did try to do an accounting/finance degree online but I decided to drop out after the first few weeks as I was working full time and had some personal issues that were making it very difficult  for me to study. I dropped out before they charge you, so I didn't pay anything for this other than the text books I'd bought.

In the city I plan to move to there is a university that is not necessarily bad, but it is very few people's ""first pick"". Because of this, it is very easy to get in to. 

I am in Australia, where our minimum wage is pretty good and having a degree isn't as popular as it is in the US. You can get many good jobs without a degree here, employers tend to hire more from work experience than pieces of paper. Have said that, I am itching to get a degree as I know it will give me better options and and more power and freedom later in my career. 

Once I get my butt to the neighbouring city and have a full time job, I am very seriously considering doing a 3 year Commerce degree (bachelors) majoring in Finance. I would like to maintain working at least 4 days per week. They give you 9 years to complete the degree, I could probably do it in 6, so I would do it very much part-time and do a class over the summers too.

The cost of the degree is approximately $30k for the 3 years. Currently Australia offers student loans with no interest, the $ value just rises with inflation. You only have to start paying it back when you are earning over approx. $50k per year and then they take a little bit out of your wages every week (the same way you pay taxes). 

I really want to do it and I am probably going to. I just worry about putting in so much effort and time and money into something that I may never ""use"". I also worry that I am getting too ""old"" to bother with a degree. I am almost 21 and everyone my age graduated from university last year. 6 years is also a very long time to commit to juggling working your ass off and studying your ass off at the same time.

I am just wondering what others think? I feel a bit strange because I'm not a mature age student but I'm not 17 years old either. Has anyone else started a degree when all of your peers have graduated? Having a job has always been a priority to me. I think it's very important to work an entry-level job in your chosen field before you commit to a degree in that field, which is why I decided to leave a full time job to take on this part-time banking job. 

If it matters to anyone, the pay for my current role is $22.50 per hour (entry level job). It's not really a question of ""can I do it?"" financially, because I can, it's more the spending of time and effort and the money it costs for the degree itself.

Please share your thoughts! I am interested to hear whether you think degrees are important or not.",finance,1403917720

Unfortunately, because of the hard financial time I missed two payments in a row an my interest rate rocketed up to 24.99% so I'm paying roughly 70$ in purchase interest on top of my monthly payment (minimum is 90, but I try to pay 150-200).

personalfinance,Choosing an online savings account,"Gonna take the plunge here, guys. I am ashamed of my financial situation and, as dozens of others do every day, I have come here to seek advice. 

I think a good first step would be to divert a percentage of my income to a savings account and forget about it. I found a bank called ""[Synchrony](https://www.myoptimizerplus.com/banking/products/high-yield-saving/index.htm)"" with an ""Optimizer Plus"" account that has a relatively high APY of 0.95%. Seems too good to be true, should I play it safe with Ally or a major brand bank? 

Here's a rundown of my situation:

Married, one child, Arizona.
Last year I made around $25k and she made around $28k, though her salary went up a few thousand since then. 

**Take home:** $1400/mo for me ($10.75 an hour, usually close to full time), $2000/mo for her. 

**Bills:**

* Mortgage: $540 (Balance: $71k, rate 5.375%)

* Auto loans: $240/mo for me through 10/2016, $300/mo through 03/2015, neither car is worth more than the outstanding balance

* Fuel: We spend about $80 a week on gas, or $320 a month. We both commute 20+ miles to our jobs (in separate towns). Where we live is cheap... before considering the commutes. 

* Auto insurance: $100/mo

* Utilities: $80/mo for a solar power lease, resulting in a $20/mo electric bill. $15/mo for water, $23/mo for trash service

* Internet: $70/mo 

* Cell phones: This one's killer. We have a family member on a third line, all smartphones on contract. Discounted rate from work, but still $200/mo. Some is compensated by the family member at irregular intervals.

* Security sytem: $50/mo under contract for a few more months. Plan to cancel when possible. 

* Health/life insurance: Combined, $340/mo.

* Credit cards: Ick. This is why I need a savings plan, to eventually conquer these. **$7,100 balance** vs. **$13,150 total limit** spread out (unevenly) over 8 cards. Most around a 22% interest rate. Some are almost at the limit, some are unused. Minimum payments add up to about $250 a month. 

* Whats left goes to groceries and meals. Keep the Change program is the only contribution to savings currently. 

**Assets:** 

* Home is probably worth $80-85k, though it needs a little work around the edges if I plan to sell

* A few hundred in checking, less than $200 in savings

* $2,800 in employer 401(k)

* A few years in college with no degree to show for it. Spouse has two associate degrees but is not pursuing a career in either field.


So yeah, I think a good starting point would be to funnel some of my income into an untouched savings account not linked to overdraft (which sometimes happens) so that I can have a chance to pay off some of this debt down the road. It will be easier when the second car payment drops off. At least I'm not paying for cable anymore. 

**Goals:**

* Decide on a savings plan, divert 10% of my income into it and don't touch it.

* Obviously get credit cards under control. Medical bills have added to them significantly in recent months.

* Move to reduce commute. I can transfer to another location across the country (expensive option to pursue initially, but I think ultimately better for the family). Could sell house or try to rent it out and rent a new place in the new city. 

* Let you all know how much I appreciate your time :)",finance,1403923963

**The Story:**  (Don't care? Skip to the question!)

When I got out of school I couldn't find a job right away. I was able to put my student loans into forbearance. I have since found a job in my field of study, got it about 3 months ago.

As far as my financial history, I don't keep a true budget. It's easiest to use the beginning of my employment as a starting point.

When I started my job I had about $2000 (or slightly more) in credit card debt. This was left over after carrying some balance from my last school expenses, and living expenses while I had a part-time job before I started my current one. I have been working toward paying it off (currently 6.5 earning periods in (I started in the middle of a pay period)). Any money not spent on the monthlies, I have put toward paying off the card. I've had a number of one-time expenses over these 3 months (~$400 trip to see my gf at school, $400 standard car maintenance two weeks ago, ~$350 reservation for a flight/car rental to see my college friends Aug 9th, $400 for a WiiU I honestly could have waited to buy, other random food and hobby expenses). But, now, I've reached the point where my credit card is nearly paid off. Sort of.

My car is at the dealer right now (again) and I *know* that will be a ~$500-$600 expense showing up tomorrow. The car is in otherwise great condition, so I expect this to be a one-time thing. Expecting to spend ~$300 on a 4th of July trip. I know what you're thinking, ""Cut it out with those trips, dude"". And, so, I am! 

Ever since /r/personalfinance became a default my back-of-mind ""I should really have an emergency fund..."" thought has been shoved to the fore of my mind. No more trips planned for this year. I'm working toward paying off the credit card and building up an emergency fund (my realistic goal is ~$3000 before the end of the year, flawless goal is $4000). I want to top out at $10,000 by Dec 2015, even if that's a little much, just for the unexplained significance that number holds in my heart. Plus, that'd really prepare me for the worst.

Since it took me a year and change to get a full-time job after graduations, my student loans were put into forbearance. They are coming out soon and the first payment due date is August 7th. The totals above do **not** include the capitalization of the interest.

I have two paychecks in July. My current plan has me putting $1,200 toward my credit card with my next paycheck. I would, with the following paycheck, pay off the remaining balance on my card to 0 (anticipating this will cost &lt; $500) and reserve the remaining money for the first student loan payment + initial August expenses (rent to parents, phone, insurance).

From August onward, my idea was to pay the minimum on my student loans until I get an emergency fund built up, keep paying off my credit card in full every month? Is that reasonable?

---
**The 401k Question:**

My employer offers a 401k through Fidelity, and I am enrolled in a Fidelity Freedom K 2050 plan. I know very little about investing, so I couldn't tell you what that *really* means except it adjusts the risk of diversified investments over time for a target retirement in 2050. I think. Correct me if I'm wrong! It's current balance is $1273

My monthly contribution to my 401k is 13%, which currently amounts to a $245 contribution of pre-tax income on each paycheck. The thing is, my employer doesn't match contributions.

Would I be better off putting that money in a different retirement investment vehicle? If I am, what would I do with the money already contributed?  

Should I suspend those payments until I have my emergency fund, or does the effect of getting the money in early outweigh that benefit if my current plan calls for having it built up by the end of this year regardless?

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry for the book. This is the first time I really sat down and recorded my financial situation, so I got a little carried away with the details. Hopefully it's helpful, though!",finance,1403927576

personalfinance,"My parents are about to downside for retirement, what are some good housing options?","**tl;dr, what are some low cost and good options for my parents in terms of housing for retirement.** 

**Situation**
My dad (78) and mum (60) are renovating the family home and getting ready to sell in the real-estate market-high that is happening in their current city. They brought the house for around 350k about 15 years ago. They got it recently evaluated at around 460k. The agents said it could go up to 500 - 550k if they do it up a bit. They have been to a number of local open homes and auctions and have seen that is where the market is currently priced at with very similar houses. They also have the family dog who will be with them during this time too. So they need a place that will allow a large dog.

**Income/Assets**
My dad has been retired for a few years now and lives off his government pension. My mum is still working full time (nurse/secretary job) and is planning to work for at least 5 more years and will end up with the same government pension.

**Financially**
I know neither have any assets (besides maybe the house, I know its a ongoing debate if it is an asset or not) nor great liabilities and or debt, besides the 60k (I think) left on the mortgage. Neither have large savings saved for retirement either. They are hoping to have around 500k left over from the sale of the house to look after themselves with. They aren't jumping into anything yet and are taking the process slowly, and with great care and advice from a family friend &amp; financial advisor.

**Health**
They're both in good health and besides monthly visits to the doctor, they are fine. Most medicine here is subsidized by the government and they have a great public health system. So this isn't a worry. 

**Prospects**
They have looked at a few retirement villages and other options. Though a lot of these options seem out of their price range and they know this. A retirement village they went to today was going to charge them 500k for the rights to lease a unit for 4 years. After the 4 years they would get 75% of that back as well as having to pay $140 a week in upkeep and pay for all their appliances, insurance and bills. This, to me, seems ridiculously bad deal. They'd have a cost of 125k over that 4 years and at a cost of around $600p.w plus the $140 on top of that as well as bills+food+appliances. On top of this they wont be able to get any capital gains from the property as they are only leasing.   

Luckily they're not going for these options but are still looking for a better option. I only stated this because they said this type of business model is quite common for retirement villages and apartments. 

I have suggested looking at the idea of renting a small unit. Interest rates on savings accounts are around 4% at the moment. They could be getting around $360p.w in interest from the $500k in the bank plus my dads pension and eventually my mums too.

personalfinance,Fixed-rate savings vs Index fund (UK),"I'm a student, and I want to put away some savings that I have for &gt;3 years. The simple option is to put it in an ISA or any fixed-rate savings account at about 2.5% but I can't help but feel that with the impending rise in interest rates this might not be the smartest option. Instead I've been looking at index funds (FTSE 100, All Share etc.) as a more interesting alternative. Is it worth the risk to go for something like this? Or should I just go for the safest option at this point in my life?

personalfinance,Larry Swedroe: The real risk of rising interest rates,"Larry Swedroe, renowned portfolio manager and best-selling author, [offers his thoughts on the futility of timing the bond market](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-risk-of-rising-interest-rates/).  Since ""Why bonds when interest rates are only going to rise???"" is one of the most-asked portfolio questions here, this seems relevant.

&gt;Investors often ignore evidence indicating that there are no good interest rate forecasters. Many bond investors then compound that mistake by operating under the belief that rising rates necessarily must mean losses. While it's true that rising yields mean falling bond prices, unless yields rise more than is already expected, bondholders will not experience losses. In other words, a positively sloped yield curve - where long-term rates are higher than short-term rates -- will provide some protection against rate increases. This is important to understand because, in general, yield curves have been steep over the past few years. 

Put succinctly,

&gt;Since there is no evidence that experts can forecast future rates any better than the market, as is reflected in current yields, investors should ignore all such forecasts.

In a nod to reasonable concerns about interest rates,

&gt;It's important to understand, however, that lower interest rates today do provide less protection against rising rates in the future. For example, a 10-year Treasury bond yielding about 2.6 percent today provides less protection against rising rates than if the current yield were, say, 5 percent.

...and in the big picture, 

&gt;The final point to consider is that while interest rate increases may lead to portfolio losses in the short term, for long-horizon investors higher real interest rates are positive for short-to-intermediate maturity bond portfolios over longer periods of time. After all, wouldn't you prefer lending your money over the next 20 years at a higher real interest rate?

The bottom line is that any interest rate prediction is just as good as any other.  Nobody can predict the future, and attempts to do so in recent years have failed.  Miserably.  Stick to your asset allocation, stop worrying about how your bonds (or your portfolio in general, for that matter) are performing, and check back in 30 years.",finance,1403974557
personalfinance,Promo interest rate expiration date - must I pay off before that bill or on that bill?,"I have a Chase Slate with a 0% interest rate for 15 months on balance transfers, grabbed it so I could skip a couple months of credit card payments in March so I could max out my Roth for 2013. I'm intending on making the payments evenly across each bill so that it's paid in full right before it expires.

The bill says the promo rate expires on June 2015. I got my first bill in April '14, which makes the June '15 bill my 15th bill. Do I have to pay the balance before that date (closing date of the June bill), or do I have to pay it off on the bill associated with that date? Do they start with the retroactive interest charges the day that 15th period ends or once the payment window for that 15th period closes?

Preempting financial lessons: I currently don't pay interest on anything and the question is coming up because I'm projecting my checking balance into next year. If it turns out I can pay the card off earlier I will but my paycheck and monthly expenses vary. I base the projection on the worst-case of no overtime and being very spendy every month.",finance,1403976702
personalfinance,Looking for advice on taking out student loans to finish my Bachelors.,"Hello, I am a student about to finish my AA in Florida. My major is Accounting. Currently, I have $19,213.85 in unsubsidized government loans. ($6,500 at a 3.86% interest rate and $11,000 at a 6.8% interest rate) I am trying to see my options as far as financing school at the university I am about to attend. The cost of tuition will be doubled at the university. Currently, I am paying about $300 for one class plus books. So I am estimating that one semester at the university will be $2,750.

I am currently a bartender at a restaurant working about 35 hours a week. It is hard to devote my time to my schooling between working and the 40 minute drive to work. I make about $400 a week. My living expenses are about $1,000 a month. My parents pay $500 of that and my boyfriend helps out with some as well (we live together). He has been taking out loans his entire schooling and is in much more debt than I am but I am not sure how much. He thinks that I should finance the last two years of my schooling. I am stuck on what to do because I would really like to quit my job and focus completely on school. I would like to spend my extra time taking one extra class a semester or getting an internship in my field or joining groups at school associated with my major. 

If I decided to quit working the next to years as I finish my schooling, I think I would need to take out loans equaling about $23,000. Debt scares me and my parents are not so willing to cosign on a loan. They are in their 60s and have hardly ever had debt in their lifetime. I would like advice that could guide me in the right direction of how I should approach these next two years.

My question is this:

personalfinance,Put money into 401k or pay off medical school?,"Hi,

I've already matched my employer's 401k contribution, maxed out my Roth IRA, and put in the max money into a 529 plan to reduce my state income tax. With the remaining money, I can either put it to max out my 401k or save it to pay off medical school. I plan to enter medical school fall of next year.

If I put it into a 401k, I will max out the 401k for this year and next year and put most of it into a company-sponsored Vanguard Total Market fund with a 0.04% expense ratio. However, I will need to get more loans to pay for medical school.

Right now, the interest rate for unsubsidized Stafford loans is ~~3.86%~~ 5.41%. I feel my 401k will grow much faster than the stafford loans unless the stock market tanks in the next few years. I also won't be able to realistically pay off the med school debt until maybe 8-10 years later. Also if I keep the $34,000 instead of putting it into a 401k, it would probably only pay for 1 year of medical school.

I'm leaning towards maxing out the 401k just because that would be worth a lot when I retire in 43-48 years, but I don't know if Stafford loans' interest rate will shoot up in the next 5 years.

personalfinance,Should I take out a private loan or do the Parent Plus loan for my last two years of college?,"Hi! After taking a year off to travel a bit and ""find myself"" I'm going back to college this fall. I finished two years at a community college and due to stupid mistakes and not getting very good financial aid in forms other than loans, I'm already about $2000 in debt (This was to pay for one year while I was working and living with my parents.) but I know I can hold off on paying that until I'm out of university. My dilemma right now is the fact that I'm able to get around half of what I need in loans in my name, and I don't know if I want to use the parent PLUS Loan or a private loan to cover the other half of this next year. 

The average cost of living/attendance at my university is about $22,000 a year according to collegeboard, which I've heard usually lists higher prices than students actually pay unless they're not very smart financially. I'm taking out $11,750 in my name so far for the upcoming year, and because I'm taking full financial responsibility of my education, I want to make sure I can either pay the loans back myself, or defer them in case I'm not able to immediately pay them back. 

The plus (haha?) side of the federal loan is that it has a fixed interest rate, so at least we would know what we're getting into. However, if for some reason I'm unable to find a job once out of college, then my parents would be forced to pay it, and I can't, in my opinion, ethically do that to them. The plus side to going for the private loan would be that, in my understanding, in the case of unemployment, I'd be able to defer the payments.

I don't necessarily think I won't be able to find work once I'm out of college, I'm a psychology major focusing on user experience and human computer interaction, which is a rapidly expanding field, and I plan on pursuing a masters or Ph.D, but there's always that doubt in the back of my mind.  

Also please note I don't plan on taking this much out in loans after this year. I'm just taking out everything I need to live comfortably this first year because I'm moving to a completely new town and I want to settle in, focus on getting my grades up (I had a really bad semester in community college leaving me with a 2.57 GPA, which is another reason I'm looking at loans as I'm ineligible for many scholarships), and getting back into the groove of college after being gone for a year. I plan on getting a job eventually to help me out, and because my grades should be going up I should be eligible for more scholarships and get better financial aid in general as well because I'll be living on my own.

If anyone could give me insight on what I should do, please let me know. With the semester approaching faster and faster, I'm getting really stressed out about this, and even losing sleep (I just noticed I'm writing this at 3:00 am, so if there's anything that needs to be clarified, please let me know).

personalfinance,How to Invest Savings before Graduate School?,"I hope this is unique enough to warrant it's own thread... I've found a treasure trove of useful information here, but my girlfriend doesn't like to trust my advice alone, so I'm posting this on her behalf to get advice from some more internet strangers :).

She is planning to go to graduate school probably in two years, for a masters which doesn't usually have funding. She'll be applying for scholarships etc, but most likely the bulk of the masters will get paid for by loans or borrowed money from parents/grandparents. Our best estimate is that the program will cost around $40,000.

Right now she is working on finding two part time jobs (one in her industry, one outside) to build up some cash reserves and minimize the loans/borrowing. She has about $10k in savings, invested in three stocks that her father chose. My advice was that because a lot of the tuition/loans will likely be at very low interest rates (possibly zero if the money is borrowed from family) there isn't a huge risk to investing the money in a total market fund of some kind (VTI for example). The downside of course being that there is a risk the investment will lose a large amount of value before she gets to graduate school and she'll have to take on more debt while waiting for the market to recover.

Am I missing something obvious? What are personalfinance's thoughts?

Currently spending $200 on living expenses, $400 food, and $400 on car/other misc expenses for the two of us.

Of all the financial models I've seen in my undergrad so far, none is verified in practice in any way. They all have some lesson to keep in mind but you just can't do the math to get valueable information. It's always up to interpretation. 

It's as if I just can't trust anything I read because ""oh well they say the rates are low but who knows what it's gonna do, might as well flip a coin"". Even people at the fed don't properly understand how to control interest rates since the reaction of people to new information is never certain. I tried many times to build a portfolio but it always felt like I was just randomly clicking links until one just looked good.

Some IPO on it's way? Just take a guess, win or lose. 
We're in a bull market? Ok what do we do with that information? How long is it going to last? Oh I was wrong well shit.

personalfinance,Advice needed: Fund an Roth IRA vs 529 account?,"Hey folks,

My wife and I moved to Ohio from North Carolina recently and we are currently living on one income.  My wife was a teacher in NC and has five and a half years of contributions to a teacher retirement plan in the state (401A).

Over the course of her employment, she contributed roughly $15k to the plan (pre-tax).  With interest, it is closer to $17k.

We have a nine month old son and are trying to figure out what is the best use of these funds.

As far as I can tell, we have a couple options:

* Keep the money in the NC retirement fund until my wife reaches 65.  Per their payout formula, this will give us roughly $200/mo in retirement (5 years of contributions, avg pay during working years, etc).  Pretty small.
* Roll the money into a Roth IRA.  Pay increased income tax for 2014.
* Cash out/withdraw the money and put it into a 529 account for our son.  We will immediately have to pay a 20% federal income tax + 10% early withdrawal penalty...I think.
* Cash out and invest on our own.  We aren’t heavily educated investors so this seems the most risky to me.

I have been investing in a 401k through my work and feel pretty confident that it should be enough for us (~$100k/year in retirement with current trend).

What do you all think is the best use of this money?

economy,Eurodollars and the federal reserve,"I was reading a little bit about eurodollars and I can't seem to wrap my head around this line. 

""Regardless of where they are deposited, London, Bahrain, or Singapore, and regardless of who owns them, Americans or foreigners, Eurodollars never leave the U.S.  Note that throughout both transactions there was no change in banking system reserves at the Fed, and the $5 million remained on deposit at a U.S. bank.  A somewhat more involved analysis would show this to be true even if the Eurodollars had been lent to a foreign corporation.

In this example, the London eurobank is acting as a financial intermediary in U.S. dollars.  It is doing much the same as any U.S. non-bank intermediary, like a finance company or a pension fund.  Unlike domestic U.S. banks, Eurobanks cannot create money in U.S. dollars through the act of lending.  Their lending only transfers ownership of deposits at U.S. banks.  ""
http://wfhummel.net/eurodollars.html

I don't get why an international bank couldn't create money like the US banks. I mean, if they took a deposit, loaned it out. Then that money came back to them in the form of a depoist, they would loan it out again essentially creating money like a US bank would, right?

personalfinance,Investing in an ISA,"Hi, I don't know a hell of a lot about investments but I would like to get into saving some money for a rainy day.
I had a baby bond setup by my parents which is about to expire so I will be getting a nice cash bump from this. I still live at home and my rents paid for the car so I don't really have any need for the money, other than ferociously spending it on crap I really don't need.

The company it was setup with (Foresters) have sent round one of their investment cronies to entice me into reinvesting with them in a form of cash ISA which would sit along side my existing ISA with HSBC which I fund myself.

I really don't know a lot about these investments, I understand the longer you keep money in a fund the more you'll make and investments where you can't touch the money until x days have past yield greater returns.
What is the general consensus with ISA investments, it seems they are quite 'hot' at the moment and a lot of people are suggesting putting money in them (something to do with the low interest rate I think)
Also what would some good questions be to ask the Financial Adviser when he comes round, I'd like to get the best out of the deal I can.

I have about 5k in the baby bond and 2k in my HSBC account. I put £200 away into the HSBC one each month. I'm 20 years old if it makes any difference.

The highest interest rate Grad Plus is 7.9% with a balance of $12,600. Second highest is the consolidation loan at 7.5% with $23000. All the rest of the loans are at 6.8%

I know conventional wisdom says to pay off the highest interest loans first, but here is my question. The 3 Stafford loans will not qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (I work for a nonprofit) while all the rest will qualify. I have 2 out of 10 years under my belt for this program already. So it makes sense that even though the interest rates are lower, I should pay off the loans that don't qualify for forgiveness.  

However, with the amount of money I am trying to dedicate to paying off these loans, I am looking to be paid off in 8 years or so for all 11 loans (hopefully less if my income rises). 

My question is, would it be best to tackle the highest interest loans first even if these loans qualify for forgiveness? Or go for the lower interest rate loans because they don't qualify for forgiveness?  

My gut tells me I should be paying off the 7+% interest loans because I may not be able to rely on loan forgiveness if I change jobs, but I also don't want to miss the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of these loans. Thanks for your help.",finance,1404144523

My expenses per month are as follows: 

- $1,030 in rent/utilities (yay expensive city...)

- $50 in auto insurance

- $200 gas/commuting

- $400 in other food/living expenses/purchases

I have student loans broken down into the following three groups (they are all federal loans, the first was unsubsidized, the second and third were subsidized):

 - $2,300 at 6.8%

 - $4,900 at 3.44%

 - $8,600 at 3.4%

I would like to ideally pay these off within two years and would like to pay $650 a month to these accounts (starting with the highest interest rate first) if I can get away with it.

I also want to build up an emergency fund of around $8,000, but am unsure about how quickly I should build it (i.e. should I dump all of my first couple paychecks to get here or build it gradually?) 

I have no large purchases coming up in the future (already own a car and a house/wedding won't be for a while), so nothing else to save for down this route. 

Aside from loans and my emergency fund I also want to look to retirement funds. My company will match 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% HOWEVER this is only after a year with the company (and I start next week, so not quite there yet). Therefore should I invest the 5% in my traditional 401k WITHOUT the company matching it and then next year when they will start matching? OR should I invest elsewhere for the first year - such as an IRA and then back to the 401k next year? Additionally, should I be exceeding this 5% for retirement savings (regardless of whether it is in the 401k or IRA) as is 5% enough?

I should also note that I plan on being with the company for 5+ years and that you don't need to invest in the 401k the first year to be eligible for the matching contribution for the following years.

So I am looking for advice on whether I can get away with aggressively paying off my student loans at $650/month, how quickly I should build up my emergency fund of $8,000 and whether or not to invest in an IRA or a non-matched company 401k for the first year for retirement savings and how much to allocate to retirement savings.

Thanks so much for advice!

personalfinance,Got a bit of debt. Is a consolidation loan a good option here?,"Kinda fuzzy on them since I haven't researched much, and a lot of places mention that it may not always be a good option. Obviously I'd need to read the fine print, but regardless:

Long story short, I'm 24 and I dug myself into about $10k of credit card debt between being jobless for a few months, a (now) ex-girlfriend, and random unexpected expenses (such as buying a new car after my old one was stolen).

Anyway, I'm making about $30k now, and I've almost completely cut out unnecessary spending, but I don't want to wreck my credit score more than I already have; three years ago before all of this debt, my score was close to 800 - and now it's in the low 700's. Beyond that, I hate being in this state of constant penny-pinching - especially when I want to be saving for a car.

So right now, I've got anywhere between 15-20% APR on my three credit lines, which is a considerable amount when I'm also paying off $15k in federal student loans (don't know that interest rate, but if I recall it's not horrible so I'm not too concerned about that for now; I'm already paying more than the minimum consistently).

Thoughts? I keep getting offers, from Prosper particularly, to get a loan with percentages as low as ~7%. Again, I obviously need to read the fine print (and ideally I'd like to pay off more/sooner, so I don't want to be locked in to a certain amount of payments with no option to pay more).

About me  
* 23 single  
* 100k/year job  
* 10k college loans at 3.2% interest  
* Roth 401(k) currently contributing $2k/month to max  
* Roth IRA that I've maxed  
* No house, 1k/month rent  
* 2k in CC debt  
* 3k in savings  

Roth IRA split between VEIPX and VFFVX ($11.5k currently)  
Roth 401k split 5 way  between VFFVX, DFLVX, VFIAX, VSMAX, PRHSX ($12.5k currently)

My current goals are to pay off CC debt and start saving for a house downpayment/e-fund. My current CC score is 706. I'm not worried about student loans because the interest rate is low. I also take advantage of stock options/RSU's and ESPP offered at my workplace that should help me get there shortly. 

So, what should I do differently? What else do you need to know about me?

**ADDITIONAL**
After ESPP, insurance, taxes, and Roth IRA contributions I take home roughly $2k/month. My total expenses are about $1500 which doesn't leave me much for savings/CC. As I said I have some options and RSU's coming soon that I'm holding out for. 

Company offers ESPP program at 15% discount that vests immediately. Also maxing this. 

**Summary Thus Far**

NEED TO DO NOW:  
* Get rid of the CC debt  
* Switch to standard 401(k) (the IRA is fine as a roth).   

NEED TO DO BUT LESS URGENT:
* Pay off student loans faster even though low interest  
* Re-balance investments  
* Weigh buying vs renting house

personalfinance,"26M, 7.5k debt with 6 CC's, want to consolidate but denied due to low credit score and car loan.","At the age of 17, I went to the ER because of a panic attack and the hospital charged me 3k, but my parents couldn't pay for it so I had to take over as soon as I could. At 19, I went to a psychologist for an expensive 1 year of therapy, which cost me 6k. At 21, I had to do emergency procedures for my teeth, which cost me 3k. Fast forward to now, I have 6 CC's that I've used to break apart / transfer all my debt, so I would avoid the ridiculous interest rates and fees. I couldn't even go to college after high school because I had to work to pay for my monthly bills. I was never taught how to deal with debt, payments, personal health, etc. so I just went along with it.

Right now, I have a 630 FICO credit score and a car that I have 9.8k left to pay off (bought a CPO car from a dealership). My monthly CC bills come out to $600 alone and it's 6 different banks that I have to manage. The hard part is that each one of these cards has really bad interest rates / fees / terms. My debt has gone down by about 4k in the past 9 years because I don't have a degree and my work doesn't pay enough.

I try to save every bit of money I have but it's incredibly difficult with a successful girlfriend that wants to live life. I've applied for consolidation loans but I get denied because of either my car loan or low credit score. I just want to put it all together, pay off my CC's and close them. I hate debt so much.",finance,1404166498
personalfinance,Recent Grad Looking for Advice to Cut Corners?,"Hi,

I'm new to this subreddit, but in need of some help. I've never been very good with finances, I only know that I need to save. I'd like to change that, I work as an artist in video games, and given how volatile my industry is I feel like I should be trying to come up with a better plan.

About me -

28F
Salary: $61K/ year pretax ($3500/month post tax)
Location: San Francisco Bay Area

Monthly Expenses -

~80K student debt in Grad plus/ Unsubsidized Feberal loans, currently on a graduated plan paying approximately $700 a month (due to increase next year) to pay my loans off in 10 years (I left grad school in 2013) Interest rate 6.8%

5 year lease on a car (4 years remaining) at about $120 a month, interest rate 6.5%

Rent: $1350/month

Phone/Internet/ Food/ Gasoline/ Incidentals: $600/month

Insurance: ~$200

I'm generally breaking about even each month. Is something I could do to save more? I've had friends tell me to bump down my loan payments, but if I bump them down to a 20 year plan I end up paying about 200K on an 80K loan. As it is with the graduated 10 year plan I'm paying 100K, it makes me nuts to pay so much more than I owe.

I do have a Roth IRA I try to put a little money in when I can, and I have some bonds my parents took out for me that are still maturing. As it is, I try not to buy incidentals much, the only thing I really ""waste"" money on is eating out with coworkers for lunch, but I like to know the people I work with so I think that's kind of important.

I make enough to live right now, but I've been laid off before and wish I could make my money go a little farther in case the worst should happen. I guess I'm just looking for advice if anyone has thoughts. Thank you so much.",finance,1404167915
