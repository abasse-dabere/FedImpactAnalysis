personalfinance,Pay for car or student loans?,"$20,000 in savings
$25,000 in student loans @ 6.55% which I am putting $550 towards a month. 

I need a car. I figure my budget is $15,000. 

My question is, where should I put my money? I want to keep a healthy amount on hand. I'm thinking about putting $7500 down on car and loans for the rest. Then putting $5000 or so towards student loans. This will leave me with $7500 in the bank and a car payment of a little over $200. 

Is this a good plan? I'm assuming the interest rate on the car loan will be less than the student loans but I don't want to put myself on the hook for too much every month for the minimum payments of the two loans.",finance,1404173124
personalfinance,Repayment Strategies,"So I was doing really well with my personal loans which currently stands at:

1. 19,724.33 @ 6.8% (no payment due till 2017 :/)
1. 4,206.59 @ 6.8% (no payment due till 2015)

Last month my parents told me they were giving me the loans they took out in my name which was:

1. 4,754.61 @ 7.9%
1. 7,054.58 @ 8.5%

Just to say I also have 

2,299 @ 0% (0% until may 2015)

After seeing the interest rates on my parent's loans. Last month I pretty much started to divert all attention to the 8.5% loan. while supplying a small amount of funds to the 7.9% and completely neglecting my personal loans since they are not due for a long time(because i had been really good with my payements). Since I currently live at home I am able to divert most of my monthly income into my loan. Which depending on the month ranges from 1,500 - 2000 a month. I've been paying every two weeks either dumping 500 or a thousand. I thought this was a good strategy until I saw 200 in interest that has accumulated on my personal. I'm assuming i should be also putting money down on my other loans...but does it make sense to put money down on it just to keep the interest down? my money would litterally just be eating the intrest? Or is there a better repayment strategy for this?",finance,1404178060

personalfinance,I want to pay off student loans and buy a house in the next 12 months. Can I do it?,"Hi /r/personalfinance!  Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am sharing my financials and my plan over the next 12 months and I'd like some guidance and advice.  My wife just graduated from medical school so we figuring out our plan for the next four years.  We have medical school loans and credit card bills but we also have some cash saved up as well.  We want to buy a house as soon as possible.

Some of the questions I have -

* Home ownership.  We want to purchase a place to live in the next 12 months.  Is this an achivable goal?  If I want to purchase a $300k condo I would need to re-save 20% down which won't be possible in 12 months.  Alternatively I could put 5% down and just deal with the PMI in order to get a house sooner.  How do I make this happen?  What else do I need to consider?

* Taxes.  I normall get a very big refund check (last year was $7k between fed &amp; state).  This year I will be writing off at least $19k and expect a big refund.  Is there a way to ensure I'm paying closer to the actual taxes I owe?

* Stock options.  Part of my current compensation is in stock options.  If I choose to leave, I will need immediate cash to pay for my stock options.  The options will not be liquidatable for 3-5 years.  Should I put money aside for this?

* Retirement.  My company does not offer a match and I am not actively contributing to a retirement account. I assume I should not raid my 401k and I should not contribute until the student loan is paid.

* Misc assets.  Should I sell my stock investments and BTC to put towards the loan?

**Plan**

* Pay off CC debt completely (next 30 days)

* Put all non-emergecy fund cash towards student loans (immediately)

* Pay down remaining student loans by $4k - $5k / month (next 9 months)

* Buy a house (next 12 months)

**Income**: $208k / year
**Current Takehome**: $10,452 / month

**Monthly Budget**

* Rent: $1750

* Food, Utilities, Car, Health Insurance, Personal, etc: $3000

* Work expenses: $1000

**Assets**

* $30k Emergency Fund750

* $102k cash

* $10k in stock

* $15k 401k

* $1.8k HSA

* 3 BTC

**Liabilities**

* $16k credit card debt

* $134k student loan debt (two loans @ 7.99% and 7.60%)

**Credit**

* Her: 790

* Me: 730

personalfinance,Want to invest before leaving the country,"I'm French, but currently working in the US for a few more months (around 3). After that, I'll have to leave the US for at least a year, probably less than 3.

In 3 months, I will have around $15k sitting in a banking account. It seems stupid to me to get my money back to Europe, since there is a very high probability that I'll have to move it again to the US after few years.

More informations:

* I have absolutely **no** debt in the US (or anywhere else).
* I already have a nice enough emergency fund back in my home country.
* Since I'm pursuing an internship, I'm pretty sure I can't start saving for my retirement, and I have no employer-sponsored plan.
* I probably won't need the money as soon as I'm back in the US, but I might need to get some of it out, as a safety cushion.
* Thanks to some agreements between France and the US, I'm exempt of some of the federal taxes. I think I might have access to $5k more next year, but I'm not exactly sure when, nor how I will get it back.

Currently, I've two ideas:

* Just put the money in a savings account. I know it is not the best, but it will still be better than just having it sitting here. It looks like the easy way out to me.
* Investing it in a low-cost index fund.

I think investing it might be the best idea, but I'm annoyed by the fact I'll be out of the country, and I'm not sure how the taxes will work, nor if I can do the important stuff/papers/... from France (I plan to set it up before leaving though).

Do you have any other recommendations? Did I miss something? Maybe some of you have some experience on how to invest while being out of the US?

personalfinance,"Starting a new job! Looking for guidance on 401k (28, single, no kids)","In August I am starting a new job. Base salary 73K +~5% bonus roughly 76.5k a year. I just graduated and have student loans of 56k with a range of interest rates from 3.4 to 6.8, all fixed. I have no credit card debt, no car payment. I will be in the Chicago Suburbs and plan to keep total housing costs at roughly 1000 a month, out of a roughly 4k take home per month.

The company matches 1/2 up to 4% and 1/4 for the next 4%. So if I contribute 8% I get a total of 11%. I also have a Roth IRA with a balance of about 11k that I contribute 50 a month for now. 

Im wondering...

Do I contribute just the 4% and get the matching 2? I am not sure the last 4% is worth only 1 more % from the company.

I am hoping to invest 15% a month to ROTH/401k so, give or take the difference to the ROTH.

Or is 15% too aggressive while I still have student loans. I plan to hit the 6.8% loans hard to get them taken care of, after that should I coast with the lower interest rates or delay some retirement savings and hit the loans harder?

personalfinance,Help with Law School Loans,"Looking for formulas for two scenarios regarding federal student loans.  The question arises since some lenders encourage students to pay off the interest accrued while the student is in school (i.e. before repayment on the loan).  Yet if one can afford to pay the interest accrued in this situation, then why not just reduce the amount borrowed at the outset of each year?  Or does this perhaps make sense only for people who would receive x amount per month, but will not have 12x at the outset of each year?

To take an example: Let's say I need $70,000 for tuition and living expenses for the academic year.  I have $10,000 that I would like to put toward my education each year.  Thus, I can borrow $60,000, $70,000, or some amount in between. The loan will have a 7.2% interest rate (capitalized) that begins accruing on the date of loan disbursement.  There is also a 4.3% charge for the loan at disbursement. I will have the same financial situation for 3 years.  I will begin repayment on a standard 10 year repayment plan within 6 months of graduation.  

The goal is to reduce the total interest paid on the loan in the long term.  Below are two possible options.  I think option #1 is intuitively the best option, but I would like to see a mathematical formula proving such if that's the case.  I would also like to see the difference between the two options (i.e. how much more in interest do I pay with option #2 in the long run?)

1. Borrow $60,000/year for 3 years + do not pay off the interest accrued during the year

2. Borrow $70,000/year for 3 years + pay off the interest accrued (by the end of each year or?)

personalfinance,Personal Finance Basics: the Tiered Emergency Fund,"Your emergency fund does not always have to sit in a savings account earning sub-1% interest.  Some people advocate a ""tiered"" E-fund which diversifies your fund into different options..

**[Graphic](http://imgur.com/a/JieC8#0)**

Rarely does an emergency require you to call-in your entire 3-6 month's expenses all at once.  In these ""emergencies"" (unexpected expenses) you can utilize your most liquid assets to pay immediate expenses and call-in less liquid assets to cover expenses in the near future.

Less-liquid options often have higher rates of return, meaning you'll come out ahead if you don't have an emergency.  If you DO have an emergency you're still covered but you need to be smart about where and when you withdraw the money needed.

Similarly, if you are disciplined you can use credit cards to float ""emergency"" expenses up to a month; in the meantime you have time to pull out money from less liquid accounts.

I'd advocate for an E-fund distribution across cash, savings, checking, gov. bonds or CDs, and (if you have a lot saved) low-risk diversified investments like a Total Bond Index.

Regardless of where you keep your E-fund, you want two things:   
1)The money must be **ACCESSBILE** when you need it.  You have to be able to withdraw it when an emergency pops up so it can't be tied up in an I-bond's 1yr holding period, or a locked-in CD.   
2)You don't want to be forced to withdraw money when the valuation has dropped because the market crashed at the same time you lost your job and your roof needs repair.  It should be in **LOW-RISK** investments and weighted more towards assets that produce reliable returns over high interest rates.

At it's core your E-fund is SELF-INSURANCE against the potential losses you face when you have unexpected expenses.  The interest rates will NOT be great, but compared to 20% APR from a credit card bill you can't pay, it's a lot better.  If you're smart and you have a plan, however, you can do a little better than just keeping a lump sum in a savings account and losing out to inflation.

What do you think?","(obligatory ""this is a long post"" comment; thanks for reading if you do; also, this is cross posted from /r/ukpersonalfinance where it drew very little attention)

So here is what I’m working with:

* **Life** Late 30s, married +1 (soon +2), moved to UK in December 2012; I work for a large Asian company, my spouse is a homemaker for the next 1-2 years.
* **Income** around £7.5k/m net; ~£4.5k/m from salary (87.5k annual gross), another ~£2k/m from bonus/commission (i.e., no guarantees and no pension/benefits on this; pretty stable for a while now) and nearly £1k/m from renting a property overseas; my spouse earns about £12k annual gross when employed
* **Expenses** £5k/m, with another £750/m (!) missing from the long term budget (i.e., I don’t see them in expenses nor savings looking long term).
* **Assets** We own a flat overseas worth about £450k (no mortgage); it makes about 3% in rent (tad over £1100 gross, tad under £1000 net)
* **Savings** About £190k overseas; £35k in tax-free ""cash ISA"" like account, the rest in cash GBP account (sold investment portfolio recently preparing for the following plan). Another £15K in the UK, part daily savings account, part cash ISA. We're ""saving"" a bit over £1.5k/m (with pension on top of that); but my numbers must be screwed up somewhere because looking over the past year and a half, we haven't saved as much as you'd expect.
* **Pension** £60k in pension funds overseas, and another £18k here. Deposits are £1k/m (~50% of that paid by employer).
* **Debt**: None (credit cards fully paid monthly).

**Comments**

 * We’re well off, I know, but our expenses are too high and the missing £750/m is a bad sign, I know.
 * I also know I should see an adviser; but I worry that holding a diploma and charging a hefty fee doesn't equate being any good. If just one in a hundred managed funds beats the index, how will I know my adviser's advice is any good?

**Goals**

 * (0-6 months) Lower expenses/save more, track expenses better.
 * (10 years) Partially retire (3 day work week or less) even if it requires some lifestyle impact (say £1k off expenses).
 * (25 years) No further lifestyle cut while retiring fully.
 * Possibly add a third kid. At least, finances/the wish to work less shouldn't constrain this decision.
 * Keep risk (too?) low. I could probably be richer if I were a bigger risk taker, but I'm not...

**Plan**

(0-6 months)

 * Get on top of expenses / cut down ~£750/m and save them.
 * Buy a property in London in the 450k/500k range. This is dampened by the current property market madness. We’re already shopping around but are likely to delay buying until prices cool even slightly (then again, we could have bought 6 months ago and I regret we haven’t done that, I hope not to regret waiting again...). I think/hope the MMR and likely interest rise will help us, as prices may cool while we remain good borrowers. All in all, I think exact speculative timing won't matter so much on a 25y scale.
 * Finance the new property like so: 165k from current savings+cash, 100k borrowed by mortgaging the property overseas for 10 years (so LTV &lt; 25%), and the rest borrowed with mortgage on the newly bought property for 25 years (so the downpayment is 165k we have + 100k from the mortgage overseas; even after SDLT and overhead, the LTV will be better than 60%). Since both mortgages have good LTVs I expect good interest rates and will aim at fixing for 5 years.
 * Keep £5k here as an emergency fund and the “cash ISA” overseas as a ‘serious emergency’ fund (and to retain tax benefits); immediately work towards rebuilding the local emergency fund to three (six?) times monthly expense.
 * Pay the 10y mortgage overseas using rent overseas. Move into the property here and start paying the 25y local mortgage instead of rent.
 * Overpay as much as we can (two mortgages allow more overpayment than one).

(in 10 years)

 * Mortgage overseas is paid in full and we have spare passive income. We now have 15y remaining on the 2nd property.
 * I believe under these conditions, even given substantial interest rises, we could pay the mortgage while cutting down our jobs to 3 days per week (we’ll be late 40s).
 * We might not be actively saving anymore at this point, but I project our pensions + property equity should sensibly allow that (paying mortgage and pension interest is ""saving"" for us).
 * Depending on many factors (interest, yields, etc) we'll probably require a lifestyle cut at this point (~1K/m). I think we’ll be happy with that in exchange for working less.

(in 25 years)

 * In 25y, both mortgages are paid, pension funds are available, and we retire without further lifestyle cuts, after having worked part-time for the past decade and a half. We live off rent and personal pension funds (and eventually leave a good inheritance for 2, maybe 3 kids).

I tried planning all this with realistic/slightly pessimistic numbers (future interest, inflation, real estate yields, expecting no income growth though it’s in the cards, etc). Under optimistic circumstances... I wouldn't mind working less than 3 days a week or moving to partial employment sooner, so long as the mortgages are paid and I maintain some employability if disaster strikes.

Does this sound solid? Am I too cautious (I'm trying to plan so we'll do OK with 2.5% return, maybe 2%, and great with 3%; should I stop being such a coward)? Spending too much (I'm guessing many people would say this...)? Overly invested in real-estate? Should spread over smaller properties to reduce risk and maximize yield? Should I play the good cards I've been dealt differently? And how will I ever get to trust a financial adviser so I’ll get some real professional help rather than obsess over my spreadsheets alone? :)",finance,1404225281

* On 5/20 Visited an Oral Surgeon regarding wisdom teeth.  Billed 250 and paid 250 for visit.  No indication that I was discounted regarding this bill (Have statement).  Scheduled appointment for 6/3 to have wisdom teeth removed (Got a 'draft bill' of 1,200, or so, USD and was informed that they ""don't deal with my insurance"")
* On 5/29 I called and cancelled the 6/3 appointment.  I have documentation proving I made a call to them from my phone then.

* Scheduled an initial appointment with a different Oral Surgeon and have an appointment for 7/25 to have wisdom teeth removed.

* For 5/20 the first Oral Surgeon billed my insurance for 53 usd - I have documentation that I paid the full 250 from my HSA and plus the statement I was presented.  It was paid in full.  No idea where the 53 is coming from.
* For 6/03 (Somehow changed to 6/20???) they billed me for wisdom tooth removal (~2.5k, about 2x the bill I was presented on 5/20).  I still have my wisdom teeth as I didn't visit them on 6/03 and cancelled that appointment on 5/29.


I have called the first Oral Surgeon to obtain ALL bills/documents pertaining to my record.  I plan on calling the insurance companies next asking for a copy of the bills the Oral Surgeon sent them and giving them a copy of what I've obtained so far and inform them that the 2.5k charge is for service that wasn't performed and shouldn't be paid.

My concern - I will be starting school this Fall.  I do not want a ding on my credit score as I'll be funding it through Federal Direct Loans.  Is there something I can do to prevent this from affecting my score / them going to collections?  I *think* I have all documents necessary to prove that the 5/20 53$ charge shouldn't be there as I paid full 250$ on checkout and that no services worth 2.5k were performed (and that they even indicated that the services would be 1.2k - I have all itemized bills and receipts).

Is there anything I'm missing and should be worried about?  Again, if this someone affects my credit score I'm afraid I won't receive my Federal Student Loans and that just causes huge problems for me.",finance,1404235127
personalfinance,"Finally budgeting, but have $23k+ in Credit Card debt","I'm 34, my wife is 33 and we've ignored our finances for far too long.

We've finally set up a budget and are sticking to it (for the most part). Unfortunately we have $23,600 in Credit Card debt. This is down from $29,300 at the beginning of the year.

We've recently paid off a couple of our higher interest rate, lower balance cards (27% &amp; 17.25%), which each had a little over $2,000 on them.

We're left with a card with $11,800 at 13.9% and one with $9,400 at 7.9%.

Luckily we've never had a problem making payments, so my credit is pretty good, around 700. I make $160k per year, my wife stays home with our 3 kids.

I'd like to get some feedback on how to get rid of this credit card debt: Would a consolidation service help (are there any that are credible?) Those interest rates are still too high, should I transfer the balance on those? Call to lower the rate? Should I take out a loan from a Credit Union to pay for the CC debt?

personalfinance,"(US)Hey PF, need some help with Student Loans","So a little background. My girlfriend just started at a university last Fall. She went to financial aid and they were terrible at helping her. She is still a dependent and her family is well off so she doesn't qualify for any grants. And the deal for everyone in the family is community college is paid for but university is on the kids. She took out the two federal loans (unsubsidized and subsidized) and then financial aid told her to take out a Parent Plus Loan but didn't help on the details of repayment, interest, or anything of the sort. The plan was to use those 3 loans to pay for 2 semesters and books. But now that she found out the details on the parent plus loan, she has to pay that back no. So we have all that figured out now.

So there's the background and here's where I need the help to help her. The two federal loans (sub and unsub) are not enough to cover the cost of her tuition and not to mention books and supplies. We live together and neither of us can cover the rest of the cost of school. What are our options? I know there are private student loans but do you have to pay those back immediately? Do schools usually offer a payment plan? Are there other federal loans that she can obtain that doesn't start repayment until she is finished with school? Thanks in advance!",finance,1404238150

There are many types of loans and I would like to hear your opinion of what is best to take in my position. I live in Denmark so some things might be different from the US and I might use the wrong terminology. Anyways, I hope you can give me some advise. My options are basically:

* **Stable-interests**: This loan type gives me an interest rate of 3% for 30 years.
* **Flexible-interests**: This loan type gives me an interest rate of 0,5% for 2,5 years or 0,9% for 4,5 years depending on which I choose. At the end of the period I have to renew the loan. At that point the interests can be higher or lower than now. Probably higher.

I am not sure for how long I will live in my apartment but I do not expect it to be 30 years. Realistically it will be around 5-10 years I think. What would you do in my position",finance,1404244097

I have an LM35 temperature sensor, amplified by an LM358 op-amp circuit (G=11), being fed into a PIC microcontroller analog input. An algorithm based on a Schmitt trigger will eventually control a heating pad (via transistor, relay, etc), but for now it just lights an LED. The whole thing is powered by a wall wort power supply (5v, 700mA - old cell phone charger). Seems simple enough. 

Earlier, I was using an Arduino with the circuit during development.  Once I got it all working (independent of the arduino), I disconnect the arduino's ground from the negative supply on the breadboard. I suddenly get a lot of noise in my system. My algorithm still works, but thinks the temperature is fluctuating wildly (+-10'C fluctuations now, when it was very stable before). The noise disappears again when I reconnect the Arduino's ground. I figured it could be noise from the power supply but it seems pretty stable when checked with a multimeter. Still, I try putting in some decoupling caps (10uF between the +ve and -ve tracks n the breadboard, connected close to where the supply is connected). Still no luck.

personalfinance,Move car equity to credit card debt?,"Hey personalfinance, I'd love to hear from some people smarter than myself on my strategy for my girlfriend's debt situation. 

She has about $5.5k credit card debt @11.9%. 

She has a car with about $7k of payments left that she can sell for roughly $14k. 

My suggestion was to sell the car and completely pay off her credit card debt with the money. Then she would finance a new/used car at 0-5% interest depending on the term, etc. 

This would basically shift her debt to a much smaller interest rate, she would have a new(ish) car and be on fixed payments rather then trying to budget her credit card down.

Assuming she won't max her card again is this a good idea? Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",finance,1404259247
personalfinance,"Constantly -$1000 in the bank account, so even when I get paid I'm immediately broke because of Rent/Car Payment/Utilities/Bills. Help!","I'll start off saying that I  currently have a pretty well paying job.  After taxes, I get $1900 every two weeks.  Before my current job i was unemployed and not eligible for unemployment for 1 year.  I blew through my savings, my line of credit, and destroyed my credit score.  

When I finally (and thankfully) got my job I was at the end of the line.  I had maxed out my credit cards, borrowed thousands of dollars from friends, sold mostly all of my valuables and had nowhere else to turn.  I've since repaid my friends and started making credit card payments (roughly $400 a month).  

But I'm stuck.  At the start of each month my bank account is overdrawn by $1000.  I get my $1950 paycheck, leaving me with $950.  I immediately owe rent, which is $1236 (very low for Los Angeles).  Since I'm overdrafting to pay rent, I make sure to take out a very little bit of cash and buy some trader joe's gift cards for myself before giving the rent, so that my pup and I don't starve to death and I have gas money to get to work.  About $350 in all.  That now leaves me overdrawn by $668 if you include overdraft fee.  I live on the $350 for 2 weeks for food, gas, entertainment, whatever emergencies come up (and they always do).  For example, I just had to get an ultrasound on my liver, which cost $160, so I had about $60 for gas and $130 for food and everything else for 14 days.  

Somehow in there my bank manages to charge me an extra overdraft fee that they always deem justified when I call to complain.  On paper, I'm usually at around -700 when my second paycheck of the month comes in, but it's usually more from extra expenses come up (medical, auto, work related, etc).  So when I take out $$ before giving rent- If I've been riding on a flat tire for the previous week I'll take out a little extra to pay for the tire.

After the second paycheck I'm at +$1200.  Car payment+insurance is around $550 (I have a lease that i regret, and insurance is expensive in Los Angeles).  Credit Card payments are $400.  Utilities Usually come out to about $300 with internet included.  Then there's the fact that I need to live for the next two weeks, so I take out a little cash before i overdraft.  

All said and done I'm usually back to somewhere between -500 and -1000 at the end of the month depending on what comes up, given that I have to also live my life in the meantime.  

It got bad recently because I've gone to three weddings, which included 3 bachelor parties.  Luckily they were all local, otherwise I wouldn't have gone, but they all require some sort of money spent.  $70 for my share of the house for 4 days of bachelor party.  I was a groomsman and had to buy the groomsman outfit for $200.  

One plus is that I've recently lost a lot of weigh because I'm managing what I'm spending on food and eating much better as a result.  

But I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck, constantly being worried that something's going to happen that will just completely break me that I won't be able to afford (accident, health issues, dog issues, etc).  I'm also tired of telling people how broke I am when they ask me if I want to hang out and I tell them that I can't.

I know that there are bad habits in there, but I don't know how to reasonably fix them while still being able to eat and live my life.  Even if I become a reclusive hermit, which isn't my personality type at all and would throw me into a deeper depression, i don't see how I can come out of this anytime soon, especially when I'm in the hole within a day or two of getting my paycheck.

I should also mention that I was never taught how to budget or manage my personal finances from my parents, or from any educational institution. I'm bad at it.

Thanks in advance to anybody who can help.  

P.S.  In all I only owe about $5000 to credit cards, otherwise I'd look into bankruptcy.  The credit cards are all with really high  (24-27%) interest rates.  Even if I make payments for a month or two, I end up maxing them out again when I need gas, or food.",finance,1404260000

personalfinance,"Dad stole money, baby here, what to do?","Obvious throwaway here, I don't want this getting back to me if any legalities become involved.

I'm in a bit of a situation right now. I'm a 24 year old medical student on the East coast. Last May I told my parents that my longtime girlfriend and I are having a baby. We're non-religious liberal-minded people and I was okay being an involved father after we talked about it. I hid both the relationship and the first few months of the pregnancy from my family because they're conservative religious folks. 24-48 hours after telling them, I found $16,000 withdrawn from my account, one that I shared with my dad since I opened it my freshman year of college. 

I was pretty freaked out, but he explained that there was some shady business going on with the company owning the family home's mortgage accusing homeowners of not making monthly payments. My dad filed a suit and needed 32K for escrow. He didn't have that on hand and took the funds from me with the promise that he would never let me without money. I thought it was suspicious but I backed off. The next weekend, my girlfriend and I figured since my parents know, we could just be open about our relationship (not the pregnancy just yet) on Facebook. So we did, and the next day I had a bunch of angry voicemails about how my mom had a panic attack and is in the ER after my sister showed it to her. My dad took another $5,000 out of my account. Things were BAD. He said my girlfriend was taking advantage of my money, but also said that I was eating fast food too much. 3 explanations all very different, super shady. I shut down the account.

In July, we agreed that until the escrow account clears with the case being set before a judge, he would pay me $1,000 a month via direct deposit. After June 2014's payment, 13k had been paid back. 8k remains.

Cue to Thursday when my dad texted me telling me to come home on Sunday between 3 and 4 to talk finances. When I said I'm very busy that day and can talk in the phone, he said it could only be in person.
After an agonizing 45 min of rehashing how I'm dishonorable and abandoned my family, he told me no more money would be coming. He acknowledges our agreement last year but somehow the 8k he owes me has already been repaid, through medical school application consultation fees in June 2011 and apartment furniture in July 2012. Keep in mind the loan money he took is from October 2012/January 2013. Anyone who knows math knows that debts don't go away because you did something nice for someone before the debt occurred.

So yeah. Here I am trying to figure out how to fix my budget when I lose a huge portion of it coming in every month. And to think I was planning on giving myself a 25th birthday present of no credit card debt in the fall.

Here are the important points here:

- I receive loans from the federal government for my living expenses. Taking into account them, scholarships, and the $1,000 I received from my dad in June, I have a budget of about $3,350/month until my next loan disbursement in December. 
- I had about $8,400 of CC debt due to medical school applications before this whole debacle and was going to pay it off (dumb that I didn't beforehand, but that's behind me now). I had to wrack up another $5,000 last summer until I received my next loan disbursement. Of the $13,400 then, I now have $7,200 remaining. I'll be receiving between $1,500 and $2,000 later this month from an old insurance claim and am planning on putting it all towards that CC debt. Is this a good idea?
- I had two CCs before this and used a balance transfer for a third one to buy me a year of time before interest kicked in. That grace period is now over. I have 3 CCs. One is at home and I'm fearful of my dad using it. The other is totally paid off and operates at 29.9%. I only use it once a month for single purchases just to maintain use. The current one has a lower interest rate that will kick in likely later this month. If I close the one that I left at home, I will have two. Is this closing the one at home a good idea?
- Would opening a third credit card (if I close the one at home) for a balance transfer be a good idea? If so, what are some good ones that will make life easier. I buy diapers and wipes worth maybe $120/month so some cash back could be great alongside a zero interest period for a year.
- Lastly, should I legally go after my dad? There are numerous bank statements of regular $1,000/month deposits that could verify our verbal agreement (enforceable in my state). My girlfriend says I should be grateful to have received the $13,000 back and that $8,000 is a small sum to lose if it means not having this kind of drama in my life anymore, but that's money I could put towards our family's future.

personalfinance,Advice for Job Change,"I am doing pretty well, but I want to make the most of a new opportunity. Here's my info:

Salary: $89,500
Take Home: $57,800 (after deductions including 5% TSP w/matching)
Spending: $36,000 budgeted (actually spending less)
No consumer debt. 
TSP Loan: $8,800 remaining from $32,500 in November 2009
Finishing MBA (July 2014) (No student loans-tuition pay as you go)

The TSP loan was unfortunate, but it was the best way to sell my house in Summer 2009 to move to DC (actually Arlington, VA) for a better job. I was promoted again last year, so debt repayment has accelerated. I am currently making $2,000 per pay check payments on the loan, so the intent is to paid off with my September 1 paycheck. 

In order to pay off the loan, my emergency fund will drop to $1,600 on September 1 before starting to build up again. 

Today I was selected for a fantastic position which pays the same salary, but will allow me to travel 2 to 3 weeks per month. It is a pay increase because I will be earning per diem which is tax free, and not spending money at home. I have done similar travel assignments before and I loved them, plus I was able to save a ton of money. 

The new position is very prestigious, and it has life changing potential. 

But I have a couple of big decisions to make. 

1) Should I continue my plan to pay off my TSP loan as fast as possible?

The new job entails potential immediate expenses. I may have to buy travel luggage especially a carry-on bag to store a change of clothes and work supplies for shorter trips. I will be a member of a team. If the ethic is to not check any bags, I do not want to be the odd-ball.

New work clothes. I have a suit, and enough stuff to last a week. I need enough so I can have things dry cleaned and still be able to travel. 

My new plan is to continue my plan to pay off the loan, and shop around. I won't be traveling until late August, so I can make a small upgrade to my wardrobe and travel luggage while not deviating from my current plan to be debt-free by September.

2) Where to live?

I pay $1,572 a month in rent which includes a shuttle to the metro stop where my work is located. I think I can get more value for my money by shopping around. Lease expires in January.

I don't take the transit subsidy because the apartment shuttle currently makes me ineligible. My intention before getting the new job was to move to within walking distance of work into a place with a washer/dryer in the apartment. I expected to pay a little more for this option.

The new job opens up more choices because commuting will be less burdensome if I am on the road most of the year. I may be able to significantly reduce my rent and find a nicer place, in return for accepting a longer commute when I am in town. Another option would be to substantially reduce costs by renting a room in a shared space.

Off the table is a choice to seek a much better apartment at close to $1,800 a month rent. I can afford it because I don't have a car, but I don't want to pay that much if I am traveling most of the time.

3) How to maximize my savings?

My current emergency fund is in a rewards account which pays 2% up to $5,000. I intend to switch to an account paying 3% up to $15,000 (Lake Michigan CU). I think I can easily build up to that amount.

I also intend to increase my TSP contribution to the max, which will reduce my take-home to $48,000. I will move money over $15,000 to a Roth.

I am contributing money as pre-tax because my current rate is 25% federal, 5.75% state.  My retirement balance is low, so I want to build it up. I believe that I will be taking money out at lower rates than my current rate because my balance is low and I will be moving to a no income tax state when I retire.",finance,1404268962

personalfinance,PayPal money management/online bank choice?,"Hello everyone, I've been lurking on here for a while but figured I'd make a post cause I'm looking for some advice on two matters. I apologize in advance for the length and for these being newbie-type issues.

I'm 25 and I recently left a job in sales that I didn't like very much so that I could pursue freelance writing full-time. I'm new to doing it full time and still in the ramping-up phase right now, but I've been doing okay so far - making enough to pay my bills, have a little fun, and put a (tiny) bit away, but I'm planning on increasing my income soon to get a more robust savings/emergency fund and pay down some of my CC/student loan debt.

The two financial issues I'd like some advice on are:

1) My bank - I've had a Bank of America Campus Edge account for the past five years. Because I don't meet either of their two requirements of having one direct deposit or a daily balance of $1,500 or more, they are going to start charging me as of next month. I'm not really looking to spend $12 a month on a checking account.

After doing some research I am looking at Capital One 360, Ally, or possibly Bank of the Internet. I like the fact that Capital One 360 has physical branches up in northern Virginia where I will be moving in a few weeks, and I've heard good things about their 360 account. I also like Ally because of the ATM fee reimbursement and Bank of Internet has a high potential interest rate. However, I'm concerned about making cash deposits - I won't be paid in cash very often, but it may happen, and I want the option to be able to put it in my bank.

I've read where people open an Internet account at a local credit union or bank and keep it just in case they need to deposit cash, then they transfer it to their Internet account. This seems like a pain. I've also read that Allpoint ATMs, which Capital One allows you to use for free, are starting to accept deposits, but I don't know if this is true or not. Can anyone verify whether or not I can use an ATM deposit to put money into an Internet checking account? Beyond that, does anyone have any suggestions for which Internet bank to use and other potential ways to get around the cash deposit problem? 

2) Using PayPal for money - most of the payment I receive is through PayPal, but unfortunately not all of my bills can be paid that way. When I can I try to use my PayPal debit card to get the rewards, but I would say 70-80% of my bills have to be paid with a bank account. Do I just need to suck it up and wait the 2-3 days for the PayPal transfer into a bank account, or is there anything easier I can do? PayPal charges a few dollars to use an ATM which I don't want to pay, and I could get cash back at a store but that requires you to buy something and usually is limited to $60 or so. Any suggestions? I'm sure there's others in a similar boat, I'm not sure if there is a solution to this but it would be good to hear how others that primarily get paid on PayPal manage their money in terms of keeping it flowing to a bank account.

**TL;DR version:** Which internet bank is best for an online checking account? Can I use an ATM to deposit cash? And is there any way to help me better manage my money if I'm paid primarily through PayPal?

Thanks for any advice you can provide, it is much appreciated!",finance,1404275111
personalfinance,"I-Series and EE-Series bonds with different ages, values, and interest rates; which should I keep, and which should I cash?","Hi guys, I have decided to look into cashing the bonds that I was given as a child between December of 1996 and December of 2006. Here is a chart detailing the important facts about each bond. 

http://imgur.com/9nOM08S 

I would like to cash the bonds within the next few years, but I have noticed that some of the bonds (mainly the I series and post 2005 EE) have much higher interest rates. Also, I have read that pre 2005 EE Bonds are guaranteed to double after 17 years. I have a decent amount of money saved in my bank account, so I am not in a huge rush to cash them, especially if I will get decent return.

I am pretty sure that I should hold on to the EE series bonds until they each hit 17 years, but I don't see any reason to hold on to them any longer than that, especially with the low fixed interest rate. I am less sure of what to do with the I series bonds. I understand that they are indexed to inflation, plus a fixed rate, so it doesn't seem like too bad of an idea to hold on to them until I need to cash them. Would it make a difference if I decide to hold on to them for 3-4 more years? I'm not sure why some of the I bonds have much different interest rates, and if those interest rates will change in the next few years. If somebody could explain the I bonds in a little more detail I would also greatly appreciate that as well.

I just graduated high school and am planning to attend an in-state college, which will cost roughly $25,000. Neither one of my parents has a degree from college, and haven't been much help in trying to assess the finances. I wasn't fortunate enough to receive any scholarships (private or from the school), even though I was fairly involved and graduated with a 3.71 gpa. 

I have done the FAFSA, and through that this has been the financial aid that my school can offer:

STATE THAT I LIVE IN Student Grant: 2,200

Fed Pell Grant: 680.00

Fed Stafford Loan-Usubsidized: 2,000.00

Federal Parent PLUS Loan: 17,371.00

Fed Stafford Loan-Subsidized: 3,500.00

I really just need an understanding of these loans/grants, which ones I should/should not accept, etc. 

My parents, like I said, haven't done much to help me. They are divorced and my dad now has two other children to support (both under the age of 5) and my mom is only supporting me, but has bad credit and all of that jazz. She has explicitly told me that she is unable to really support me through college, so she (and my dad) aren't really options support-wise.

I really just need to know what else I can do, so that I can eventually be what I want to be.

Long story, but not really important. I would really like to get this out of default and was wondering what my options are. From my research it sems that the loan isn't eligible for a consolidation loan or for rehabilitation as it wasn't issued by the federal gov't.

I've been making payments on it for around a year now, but would like to pay off the balance. And obviously banks are a little hesitant to lend to someone with a 15k loan in collections. I do have the money between several accounts to pay it outright, but that would really put a dent in my savings and 401k and put off buying a house for another year or two.

I was wondering if I would be able to take out a student loan to cover it, but i'm not sure I can do that. It *is* an education related expense, but I'm not currently a student and I would not be paying the money to an educational institution.

Will my bad credit affect us even getting one?","Just to clarify. She is going to be attending PA school and making no money. I on the other hand, just obtained a job out of college and make a decent salary for my field of work ($41,000). My last year of college I obtained 2 small lines of credit ($300 &amp; $500 through 2 separate companies) on top of my student loans ($28,000) and was very bad at managing those. Since, I have started my new job however, I have gotten those under control and feel good about where I am, though my credit score is still low.

We're looking at houses in the $125,000 range (we can afford ~$900-1000/month) and can afford to put about 10-15% down.

To clear up a couple of questions that people had:
We are getting married next May.
She will be starting PA school next summer and is not guaranteed a job in the area that we currently live in.
The lease on her apartment is up in January, hence my idea was to have a place bought by then, split the monthly with her (she is making money right now) and pay my own rent (it's only $250/month) until I move in.
Looking back at it now, I think a lot of people in this thread are correct in steering me away from buying at this particular moment in our lives. I think with the notion of being married next year, I really wanted to put icing on the cake with a house of our own. Financially, doesn't make sense. I have come to terms with that, and am looking at places to rent in the $700-$900/month range in order to continue saving up money until she is out of school. At that time, we should be able to afford a nicer place, I'll have rebuilt credit, and perhaps we may even be able to achieve our goal of building our own place!

solar,"Looking into residential solar, need advice","this may not be the place to ask these sort of questions, but I need some help evaluating a residential solar proposal. I don’t have exact numbers yet, but I wanted to see if this makes sense to people that know more than I do. I live in Massachusetts. I’ve made contact with 3 companies to do an assessment of our house and get quotes on owning/leasing a residential solar system. I've received 2 quotes so far.

The last one that visited here yesterday detailed a plan (dependent upon the engineers evaluation) that looks like this:

* Cost of system – 25k to 55k (I probably am on the lower end, I have a small house, moderate usage, minimal trees, etc). 
* Financing would be – 0% down, 18 month 0% interest loan for the first part/downpayment, based upon preapproval
* He said that the initial payments could be made with the tax credits and rebates I would get:
 * 30% Fed Tax Credit
 * $1k MA state tax credit
 * Up to $3250 in state rebate
* Then the loan would be a 12yr 2.99% loan 
 * He gave the example of a $200/mo payment
 * If that was the case – my regular bill is $100 and then I would receive energy credits from the utility of 10k to 30k for 10 years. 
 * Without knowing the specifics, it’s difficult to know, but he used an example of 150/mo (middle of that estimate) in energy credits. So that would net me $50/mo and allow me to pay down the loan earlier than the 12 year timeframe.

The other company I have a quote from offered an ownership option, but did not get that far into specifics in the financing situation, so I’m not sure if this is way off and I should be skeptical. I intend to ask the other company about my financing options, but I only met with this guy yesterday.

personalfinance,Financing a relatively cheap car?,"I've been driving for about two and a half years. Right now, I'm using a '97 Altima that belongs to my grandparents. I won't bore you with the details, but long story short, I won't be able to continue driving this car for more than a few months. Right now I'm working my way up to purchasing my first car.

My desired car is a 2006 Civic - sort of right in the middle between old and new. The design makes it look newer than it is, but the price is still right. Then there's the great fuel economy, which is always nice. I should be able to pick one of these up from Craigslist for about $7k, give or take.

My girlfriend just got a new job, so I no longer have to support the both of us, which (combined with my lack of living expenses) will allow me to save a lot more in the coming months. Unfortunately, I don't think any amount of frugality will allow me to save the full required amount before I have to stop driving my current car.

I have been thinking about getting an auto loan from my credit union - mostly because, due to my limited credit history, they're likely the only chance I'd have. I would like to put 50% down and pay the rest off over a year or two at a 3.49% interest rate (a little higher than normal since the car is from before 2010).

My thinking is that since this isn't a very substantial loan, it may not be as bad an idea as it sounds. The amount of interest I'd have to pay is pretty low (certainly enough to justify the convenience of having a car sooner rather than later), as are the monthly payments. Also, by paying on time every month (easy enough for a ~$200 payment), I should have a chance at building my credit.

Here are the things I'm worried about:

1. Unexpected issues with the car. I'm planning on asking my girlfriend's brother (professional mechanic) to take a look at whichever cars I decide to check out, and there's no way I'm driving off without a test drive, but there's still a bit of fear in the back of my mind. Some cars of this model have a manufacturing defect causing the engine block to crack, usually before 100k miles. It's a $2000 repair, which is basically 25-30% of the car's actual value. If the car has already reached 100k without any problems, does that mean the problem is unlikely to occur if it hasn't already, or does it mean that the problem is right around the corner? It's impossible to know.

2. Insurance. Since I'm driving one of my grandparents' cars, I've been on their insurance, but I'll have to start paying my own when I get my own vehicle. This is the part I haven't researched much, so I have no idea how much it will cost me as a 20 year old male with 2.5 years of driving experience.

I'm so close to paying off my first credit card as I'm working on eliminating my personal debt. I started with my card that has the highest interest rate and should have it cleaned off with my next paycheck. Now I need to know where to go next. 

I currently have two cards that are 0% interest rate that I've been making minimum payments on while working on my cards that have charged interest. One card doesn't have interest that kicks in for another year but I have one that comes up in February. The balance is $1778 and when the interest rate kicks in it will be at a ridiculous 22.9% which is WAY higher than any interest rate than I have. The next card that I would have moved on to after paying off my first has an interest rate of 15.9%. 

Which card should I pay off first? The balance on the 0% card is significantly smaller than the 15.9%, and I have worked out some math. I could have 0% card paid off in Feb by paying $112 each pay check and I would still have some money left over for the snowball method for the 15.9% card. Should I go that route to eliminate another debt while avoiding the future high interest? Or is there a way I can still take advantage of the free interest period while making good progress on my other cards?

My wife and I are 27 years old. I get a 6% 401k match from my company, so that's what I contribute there.  Then, I contribute another 5% to the Roth 401k.  I stopped contributing a few years ago to the Roth IRA because of the high fees (I'll talk about this below). Income after medical insurance and 401k investments: ~$7800/month.  

Networth:

* Equity in home: ~70k

* 30k in savings / EF

* 57k Traditional 401k

* 15k Roth 401k

* 15k Roth IRA

* 3k Vanguard stock market index fund (just started)


Monthly budget:

* 1800   mortgage (P/I + taxes + insurance)

* 50      HOA

* 460    student loans (personal, consolidated most of them into this loan @ 4.4%, done in 2 years)

* 130    student loans (other, ~10k remaining @ 5.15%)

* 530    car payment

* 85      auto insurance (both cars)

* 65      internet

* 95      cell phones

* 300    gas for car (I work from home so hardly ever need to go anywhere, wife will be commuting a bit to  work )

* 50     car care (averaged)

* 250    electricity/gas for house (averaged)

* 500    groceries

* 200    dining out

* 200    clothes and shit

* 100    gifts

* 900    child (800 for day care + 100 misc)

* 400    misc other stuff (personal items, household junk, etc)

==== $6215 in total monthly expenses, leaving around $1600 ""extra"" per month.

You probably noticed I don't have line items for things like vacation fund, transfer to savings, Roth IRA contributions, etc.  The reason for that is I wanted to hear everyone's advice on what the best long-term solution would be for those allocations.

**Vacations**: I'm not super-interested in traveling much in the next few years (I'd rather save 5k * 3) and vacation with our kid when she's old enough, but my wife really wants to vacation every year. Going off-topic a bit, but my idea of vacationing is working on hobbies around the house and spending personal time doing things that are interesting to me.

**Savings / EF**: I think anything over $30k is overkill and should be invested. Thoughts on that?

**Roth IRA**: I stopped contributing a few years ago and found out about Roth 401k through my work, so I started contributing to that (Roth 401k) instead.  The Roth IRA is ""managed"" by a family member who makes money selling these to people. I don't want to keep dumping money into it, but I'd feel bad about moving it elsewhere, so I've just been ignoring it altogether.  I know what I need to do, and I doubt he/she will care too much, but I'd still feel bad. Anyway, if I choose to transfer this elsewhere, is this something that Vanguard could pick up (the Roth IRA), and would that be a good place for it?

**Mortgage**: I want to pay the mortgage down faster, so I've been throwing an extra $700/month at it (we moved in fairly recently).

**Other investments**: Like I mentioned above, I just opened a Vanguard account and put $3k into the stock market index fund.  Is this something I should continue to make contributions to (monthly), or should I focus on other things first?

......

Some questions I have in my head are:

* Should I just pay the $10k student loans (the 130/month payment at 5.15%) off in cash, then pay my savings/EF account back first?  Or would it be better if I invested that money since the interest on the loan is only at 5%?  I'm looking purely long-term here, so if I assume 8-10% long term growth in the market, is that a good way of looking at it?

* My mortgage interest rate is slightly higher than my personal loan of 460/month.  Should I throw money at the mortgage first, then?

* I'm thinking of allocating the ""extra"" 1600/month like: 700 to principal on mortgage, 400 to Vanguard index fund, 400 to vacation fund (since that's important to the wife).  Is that reasonable?

* Another option is (based on this helpful diagram: http://imgur.com/a/JieC8#0) to throw about 400/month into a Roth IRA, and 1100/month extra from 401k contribs (this would put me just over the yearly max).  Would this be wiser than the previous bullet?

* Is paying off the mortgage (at 4.5%) faster not worth it, since I could invest all that extra money at a long-term rate of 8-10%?

* Should I max the Roth IRA contribs before the Vanguard index fund? I know general advice is ""yes"", but is this always the right thing to do? I'm wondering since I have a Roth 401k if I really ""need"" a Roth IRA (I'm not too sure of the differences).  I like the simplicity of controlling my Roth 401k contribs straight from work.

* In about 2.5 years, we'll have an extra 460 + 800 per month due to loans and child care expenses going away.  What should we do with this?  Toss it all into index funds?

What other general (or even specific) advice would you have, just based on my situation?

personalfinance,Is 12% enough in my 401K at age 24?,"I am 24 years old. My salary is $68,500 plus roughly an extra $4,000 anually by maxing out our 15% stock discount purchase program, so call it $72,500k~ minus any kind of bonus I may or may not receive. 

I currently deposit 12% from each paycheck into my 401K. Match is only $200 annually so not really relevant here. I have about 5k in a 401k from my last employer, and probably around $15k in a ROTH IRA set up by my mom years ago when I first earned a paycheck when I was in like, idk, 4th grade for some acting thing, and then whenever I had some income after that, plus the last few years. I haven't personally looked at my roth IRA because it's managed along with a portfolio set up for me years ago by my family's financial planner, and I'm sort of just letting it do its thing for now.

So, say we're starting at around 20k in all my retirement accounts. Putting ~8.5k in per year, plus maxing out the ROTH IRA so total of $14k annually. Now this is sort of my long term future plan ... I do plan to go to grad school in the next few years + travel for a bit, so I won't be putting anything in for maybe 3ish years. Fast forward to when I anticipate finishing grad school and entering the working world again, let's say I'm about 30. That's when I'll be able to start contributing again, but I'll also be in hella debt from grad school (looking at an MBA program in a NYC school, so it will likely set me back at least 200k) so it may not make financial sense to really contribute in a big way until that's paid off depending on the interest rate and my average returns (I think I can expect at least a 7% interest rate minimum on my loans). So there's a chance I may not be contributing again much until my mid-30s. I hope to be making at least 100k after I get my MBA, but I want a job that has to do with sustainability and like, bettering the planet and making a positive difference, and those tend not to pay as much as something a little bit less fuzzy and a little bit more hard hitting. So let's just say 100k because I could probably get there naturally anyway, so it's a pretty safe number. 

That's sort of as far into the future as I feel I can comfortably anticipate ... kids will come mid-30s, probably, and my partner and I are anticipating relying on my income. I plan to financially support him, our future children and myself, so I want to be very pro-active in my savings (and guide him to do the same - but that's a tangential issue at this point). Of course I'll be consulting my financial planner about all this but, JUST FOR KICKS, tell me ... am I contributing enough to my 401k right now, given that there will probably be a gap in contribution for a few years and I'll need to support my partner and a family eventually as well? I know that starting young makes a huge difference so I want to make sure that I'm doing as much as I can while I'm able.

1.  Should I just defer my loans and spend the 380 a month in a better way?  I cant see how less than 400 a month is even putting a dent in 220k.  I am on the ""pay as you earn"" plan.  I would rather enjoy the money or invest it and pay the loan when I have more disposable income, but I don't know if that's a wise decision right now.  I don't know if 200k a year is enough to live well, buy a house, pay back loans, and start saving/investing in a couple of years.

2.  Should I be living frugally and paying back loans?  Right now, I spend a lot of money on electronics, eating out etc because 53k is actually a lot of money for the area I live in.  I'm in the top 10% of earners in the area.  Am I seriously hurting myself later but not putting every penny I can afford to back into my debt?

3.  What can I be doing at this stage to optimize by financial future? 

Thank you, I greatly appreciate any advice.",finance,1404351427
personalfinance,Credit card debt problems,"Hi PF,

So, after a bit of a rough year, I am very much back on track to financial bliss. Due to having to move, and being unemployed for a time, however, my credit cards (Totaling about $13,000 at 20-22% APR) are almost maxed. I will have a ~1000 buffer to pay them down per month, but at present, that puts me at over a year at 20%, which, by very rough math, costs an additional $2000.

I do not want to pay that interest. Not even a little bit. 

Things I have tried:

* Calling to get the APR reduced. No go.

* New card, high maximum, 0% APR. No go. Got a new card for $500, 0% APR, and denied by 2 others.

So, I'm left with loans from family/girlfriend, or, consolidation.

I do belong to a credit union, and I intend on asking them for a loan. 

My credit score is 630 (used to be 720, but, dat high balance).

Having never asked for a personal loan before, how do I do it, can it be done online, will it lower my score further, and what are the odds I actually get one, and what type of interest rate am I looking at?

Have I missed any options?

I heard someone mention (maybe not on reddit) that they use a special online bank which provides huge APY, but the down side is that they don't have any physical banks for ATMs. Thus, they put all their savings in that online bank, and just transfer some money over to their other bank which has physical ATMs should they want physical cash. I'd be interested to know more about this as well, specially the specific bank as well as any other alternatives to this method.

personalfinance,Real Estate Condo Purchase in Chicago with 3 year Holding Period?,"Caveat: So my calculations are kind of a mess...

My dad is thinking about buying a condo for my brother in Chicago, and I'm not sure how wise of an investment it is compared to my brother just renting. I'd like to get the group's opinion please. Here are the relevant figures below. 

Asking Price: $340,000 (assumed to be fair)

Down Payment (Equity): ~$100K

Loan Amount: $240K

Interest Rate: 4.00%

Effective rate after tax savings: 2.76% (http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/loan-tax-deduction-calculator.aspx)

Holding Period: 3 years

Term: 30 years, full amort

Monthy P+I, Taxes+Ins, HOA = $2000 = ($1146 +444+407)

Tax Rate: 25%

State Tax Rate: 8%

Appreciation: 1%

Inflation: 2.45%

SP500 Investment: Assumed 5% return

Rental Income if choose to rent: $2,500 (bro would pay $1250, roommate would pay $1250, otherwise 2 random tenants would pay $2500)

Brother's Cost of renting a room now elsewhere: $1250

Location: Lincoln Park/Lakeview, CHI, less than 1 mile from the lake

Layout: 2bed/2ba ~ 900 sq.ft.

Amenities: Top floor, great view of park and lake, gym, nice building that was rehabbed in 2006, originally built 1960
Other possibility: Holding for the full 30 year term

Concerns:  

-$100K in equity for minimum return over 3 years vs. just investing in SP500

-3% appreciation over 3 years; in other words, very little

-buying a hassle - we are not based in Chicago; brother is there now for school

-ongoing management

-possibility of using the $100K for alt investments - none of which have presented themselves at this time.

Ok, So, I'm a little confused on how to approach this, so I'll just focus on cash for now over a 3 year holding period.

Net Cash if Renting = -$45,000 ($1250/mo * 12mo * 3yrs)

Net Cash if Owning: 

CF = 1250*12*3 = $45000 from a roommate

Monthly cost(mort.proptax.ins.hoa.) = 2000*12*3 = $72000

Repairs - lets assume $0 since not much is going to happen in year 1-3

Taxes=$0 since incurring losses

Taxes savings - (3700*3 via online calc) = $11,100

Net Cash at y3 = -$15,900

Net Cash Saving = 45,000-15900 = +$29,100

Other considerations:

1% appreciation over 3 yrs, so $340,000*1.01^3= $350,302

equity built = $13,203 (via spreadsheet)

So, proceeds of sale = $350,302

Selling costs = -$21,018

Loan Balance = $240,000-$13,202= $226,798

Net Proceeds = $102,486

Gain from sale = $2,486

Net Cash Saving + Gain = $31,586

Net Cash if Renting = -$45,000

SP500 @ 5% Return = $100,000*1.05^3 = $115,762-$100K = $15,762.

Holding for the longer term looks a lot better as well, according to my calculations. Cash on Cash return looks to be about ~15% over a 10 year period.

So, according to these calculations - the decision seems to be BUY, correct? Combining the numbers with a pretty damn good location, in my opinion, makes this a go.  

Would love to hear your thoughts on whether you would do this deal, considering everything I mentioned above.  Also, this whole investment proposition is based on a 3 year holding period, but I could easily see us holding for longer.  

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I have seen the masters at work here on /r/personalfinance, and I am humbly enlisting your help on this matter. Thanks again!

personalfinance,What's the magical loan number? (US),"So, obviously, I know if you have credit card debt at 18% or suchlike it is imperative to pay it off as soon as possible. Whereas a home mortgage with tax-deductible interest at, say, 3% it makes sense to pay it off as slowly as possible because you're probably making more money off that debt than you are losing money. But what is the magic number where that tips? I would imagine the number is different for tax deductible interest loans like mortgages and federal student loans than for other kinds.

As a precaution, all deposits originating from German banks &gt;are currently considered high risk and we have to be very careful, &gt;which is the purpose of this hold.

I asked about the kind of irregularities and investigations and offered my help to clarify everything, but they didn't give any further answers.

I should tell that currently there are investigations from the BaFin (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority in Germany) against me, because I offered to buy and sell bitcoin via localbitcoins.com, but didn't know that I need a BaFin license for that. So Kraken might have felt the pressure from them to freeze my account, but would be nice to know for sure and I don't know why they would forbid me to normally buy bitcoin on an exchange.

**TLTR: bitcoin might free you from mean banks, paypal, etc but only if you are in control of your bitcoin. Otherwise there is no difference when it comes to freezing your accounts and money**

also, if i buy into a bond fund/etf, i know that, like stocks, i can buy low/sell high if i time correctly. but beyond the natural ebb and flow of fund prices, do these bonds pay interest much in the way a stock pays a dividend? is it generally re-invested?",finance,1404400698

personalfinance,I think my trial &amp; error retirement account learning has led to a false assumption of diversification &amp; excess fees. Yes?,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

As my title implies, I've played around a bit while learning the ins &amp; outs of basic retirement investing.  While I feel that I have learned a lot, I also think that I've left a bit of a wake of messiness and inefficiencies.

I'm 29/M, graduate student (with funding), own a duplex which I rent out half of, as well as a rented room in my unit to subsidize my mortgage.  My living situation pays for 87% of the mortgage (which includes escrowed insurance/taxes/PMI) and that's at a reduced rental rate because my first tenants are friends that continue to put up with me slowly fixing the place up.  Right now I'm putting a bit more money into the building than I probably should be, as I'm more than off-setting my ""income"" from it, but that's a whole other thread.

Over the years I've played around with retirement savings, starting with ING direct as a 19 year old.  At that point I was simply dividing my contributions into a Traditional IRA account, and a ROTH IRA and messing around with CDs and their fantastic interest rates on just regular savings accounts (at the time).

I wanted to learn a bit more about investing a few years later, so I transferred my Trad. &amp; ROTH IRAs to USAA which I was just starting to use for checking/insurance.  (Another reason to thank grandpa for his military service)  At this point I was also realizing that my first foray into investing with a USAA brokerage account was foolish as I wasn't even fully funding my IRA savings (I did learn how quickly things can rise and fall however!).

Over the years I made some stupid decisions, and some good decisions.  One of the better decisions (with my lower income) was to put money towards my ROTH and stop funding the Traditional.  

I'm hoping that folks can give me some constructive advice, and that this may serve as a good example of things to do and not to do for those just starting.

Anyway, enough talk - here are my numbers currently:

**USAA ROTH IRA**

* Stocks: $3,350  (overall gain of $830) 6 different companies, most of whom I'm happy to gamble with (with an eye to the longer term future) - slight emotional attachment to solar companies and tesla.  One very dumb purchase of some JC Penney shares because I read some stupid investing blog one day - a very good learning experience about trying to time the market that now shows a loss of about $350.
* Mutual Funds: $7,850  (overall gain of $460)
          this includes about $4k in VFINX my most recent investing, and $1.3k in URFFX, USAA's 2050 retirement fund

**USAA Trad. IRA**

* Stock: $840  (just some shares of GE with a gain of $240)
* Mutual Funds: $1,400 (gain of $300) USEMX and USMIX. I was just kind of wildly stabbing at what I thought was a good idea at the time.

**Vangaurd SIMPLE IRA** which I contributed to through a former employer (2012-2013)

* Entirety of $1,840 in VFIFX (Vanguard's 2050 retirement fund) with a gain of about $540


So my current understanding is that I should probably transfer my IRAs to corresponding IRA accounts at Vanguard, so that I can lower my expense ratios.  I *think* to do this I would need to sell through USAA, setup a new account with Vanguard (which I hope is easy since I already have a SIMPLE IRA with them) and then transfer over.  At that point, it seems like it would be good for me to stop ""diversifying"" so goddamn much, because I don't currently have a good handle on my allocation, and I seem to be overlapping asset classes from different purchases with target date funds that are automatically doing their own allocations.  I'm thinking I should consolidate in the direction of VFINX as I won't be retiring anytime soon and am comfortable with some risk.

My current USAA IRA accounts fall into this allocation: http://imgur.com/kioQjfF

While a total unrealized gain of over 10% looks good, I know that it was just because I actively contributed throughout the recession, and the market came back.  I think that if I had gone with a more Boglehead approach at that time I would have seen a much greater return.  Wasn't the rebound something like a 30% gain?

Anyhow, I know I've made mistakes in the past (USAFX precious metals &amp; minerals fund, I'm looking at you), but I think I'm headed in the right direction. 

Thoughts? Suggestions?  Future lessons to avoid learning this way?

Thanks!",finance,1404402560
personalfinance,Paying cash vs Financing: What's your tipping point?,"My brother-in-law and I have completely different views of debt. He sees debt as a terrible thing and he refuses to get into any debt that he cannot absolutely avoid, basically meaning he only has a mortgage. When it comes to anything else his philosophy is if he doesn't have the cash, he doesn't need it. He buys cars, trailers, livestock, farm equipment all with cash. He makes a good middle class income, but definitely lives a lower class lifestyle because of his hatred of debt. 

My point of view is that debt can be a good thing when managed appropriately. I bought a car recently and it was $31K. I could have paid cash for it, but instead I chose to finance it with a 1.6% interest rate. In my mind that $31K is going to do much better sitting in my investment account earning more interest than the 1.6% I'm paying now on the car. I pretty much stick to financing as long as the interest rate is less than 4%. He

personalfinance,Need Help Settling Internal Debate,"Hey everyone. I have a few conflicting thoughts and was looking for some help trying to come to a final decision. I'm wondering if we should pay extra toward the mortgage and get it knocked out in a short a time frame as possible or invest in retirement.

I have a primary job and a side business on nights/weekends and my wife works part time. Her income goes to her account from which we pay for ""luxuries"" (cable, cell, gym membership etc). My primary job $$ goes into our joint and my biz money goes to a joint checking. They're all linked for easy transfers.

**Vital stats:**
Married, living in Maryland (US)
Monthly income: self - 3147 net, wife - 800-1200 net, side biz - 200 net (varies)

**Monthly Expenses** - ~3300 incl mortgage/escrow of ~1300 (obviously this varies slightly based on grocery expense/utilities, but it's 3300 average.

**Assets**
Capitol One Savings (emergency fund): ~27,000
Cars - 2k (mine), 10k (hers) [no loans on either]
Retirement Accounts - ROTH 401k: 7000, ROTH IRA: 6800, 403b: 6500

**Debts**
Mortgage - 180k (it's worth about this much)

We pay our CC bills in full each month and the mortgage rate is a 30 year at 4% (so, 3% effectively after taxes). We both really hate debt but there's not a ton of wiggle room in our budget aside from gym and maybe cable, but that'd only be about $30/month. So, should we go crazy and pay this mortgage off (like, 6-800/month crazy). At that rate we could do it in like, 11-12 years. 9 years if we can put up 1k/month.

We've been trying to get up to a 10 month emerg fund (as my wife is much more risk averse than I am) but we're also adopting soon, so that fund is gonna take a huge hit (about 19k). So, we're trying hard to fund it back up to 25-30k levels. BUT once we're done that....what next??

I know that investment interest rates are a better *possible* return, but I also know that ""mortgage"" means ""death contract"" in French, so yeah...I HATE debt. Help?

Edit:  **Budget Specifics**

From Joint Account (from my income of 3147)
Tithe - 324
Mortgage - 1317
Auto/Gas - 400
Utilities - 150
Water - 40
Savings - 530 (400 is actual savings, 130 is for car + house insurance, of which we pay once annually for each)
Internet - 25
Baby ""stuff"" - 150 (not actual yet. This is in preparation for a kiddo)
**Joint TOTAL** - 2936
*Difference* + 211

From Wife's Account (800/month conservatively)
Tithe - 80
Restaurants - 75
Discretionary - 200
Cable - 50
Groceries - 300
Gym - 10
Cell - 45
Baby - 60
**Wife TOTAL** - 520
*Difference* - +280

So, looking at it, I guess we have a surplus of about $500, which we should probably be throwing 100% toward retirement, as that's about 16% of my net income. It sounds like the consensus so far is to ignore the hatred of debt/being risk averse and stock as much as possible into retirement? Thanks everyone for all your help w/ this.

dogecoin,"Personal review on the ""GAW Miner - The Fury"" scrypt asic miner","I believe about now almost everybody here knows what an ASIC miner is so no need to go over that...

Let's get to the point... ""GAW Miner - The Fury"" is a scrypt ASIC miner that recently got a lot of attention, some people got their hands on a few of them (or a [dozen](http://redd.it/298myx) :P)... I also ordered a pair of these... but they cost me quite some extra for international shipping and VAT in my country...

The price stated was $110 and with a coupon I got for an order over $200 I couldn't resist taking another one... Unfortunately, only shipment option viable for international shipping was an extra $25 for FedEx, but hey, still worth it... No problem with payment, package was sent and delivered (almost) on time, but then the VAT kicked in and some other delivery services, charging me another (exchanged to USD) $85... So, in the end, it cost me almost 3 Furies to get 2 Furies. (sarcasm)Yay...(/sarcasm)

Anyway, after opening the package I found 2 power supplies, 2 power cords (110 V, USA standard, useless here in some parts of EU), 2 USB-2-microUSB cords (the correct ones) and 2 boxes with ""The Fury"" miners inside. All nicely packed and protected in a box.

Fortunately, the power supplies are compatible with either power network (110V - 230V) and I had the correct power cords so no problems there. The miners had their cooling fans disconnected for apparent safety reasons and reconnecting them was easy. Once powered, the fans immediately started working. Next step was connecting them to a PC, but encountered a minor setback... Windows couldn't find the right driver for the miner... After some short googling, I found the correct [driver](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx) and installed it. Afterwards, the miner was ready, just needed to be configured.

Finding clear instructions how to configure the miner wasn't so straight forward as I expected, but found a [helpful post](http://redd.it/2924a1) on reddit on how to configure one. And then, it was time for the first run (wow, much excite).

After connecting to a poll and letting it run for some time, I was very pleased with the numbers I saw... ""The Fury"" is declared to run at 1.3 Mh/s, and it was running around that number, but after a prolonged period of time, stabilized at 1.25 Mh/s average, probably because I played it safe with the clock speed of 300. I suppose it can take about 10% more but I didn't want to burn it on the first run.

There are some issues with HW errors, they seem to generate at a rate of 5% of all accepted hashes on a fixed difficulty at 128, but rejected hashes are way lower, about 0.1-0.2%. I also tried with BFGminer and didn't encounter any major difference in generated HW errors or rejected hashes... but it was reported that some miners worked way better on BFGminer compared to CGminer.

Regarding the heat, the fans do a very good job keeping the temperature of the miner at acceptable levels, the heat sink is warm to touch, but not hot. On the other hand, the power supplies are way hotter (that sounds wrong... on many levels) but the heat is manageable, placing them on a floor with a rug is a very bad idea but on a flat solid surface they tend to loose the excess heat on their own. Another option is to use the airflow of the miner to somewhat blow on the power supply because the air coming of the miner is way cooler than the power supply. Also, an alternative to all that is to buy a stronger power supply and it won't produce that much heat.

Both miners have been running for over 24 hours now and have mined roughly 6000-7000 doges in a PPLNS pool and their combined hash rate comes to about 2.5 Mh/s. The fans are quite silent, but still produce some amount of noise...

For what is worth, it might have not been the most profitable thing to do, but now I'm happier since my GPU is relieved of mining duty and I'm mining some ""serious"" doge ;)",cryptocurrency,1404408947
personalfinance,Is my contemplated plan a smart move? 20-something University Student trying to do right.,"I'll try to keep this short. I know I can easily write a wall of text or divulge too much / useless info. lol

I'm a 25 y/o part-time student (who just got accepted into a University after Community College) who works a full-time job in the finance department of a small business.

In short, I made a few regrettable personal and financial decisions over the last few years whilst trying to progress forward in life. (Note to self: keep emotions and business separate. Doesn't matter if it's an SO or family). 

I'd say I have an interesting financial history. I have no idea if I've been dealing with it appropriately enough - it's a little complicated. Basically, because of events over the last 2 years, I have fallen behind with regards to my debt.

But here's a quick summary of what I'm working with:

Credit Card 1: Major Credit Company - Have good standing; good payment history, etc. Balance of about $2.5K but I have payment protection; they are working with me in order to reduce my debt - no interest while protection is active. 

Credit Card 2: Special Offer from my Credit Union - I have been using this program for a little while now. The program has been working fine until recently when I missed a payment... $20 late fee, ugh. The program is basically a Balance Transfer @ APR 1.99% for 12 months. Primarily used to reduce Credit Card 1's debt.

Credit Union: Savings/Checking - Credit Card mentioned above through this CU. I have a standard savings account with a decent dividends yield rate (compounded daily, unsure of %), no service charges. Two checking accounts; one for personal and one for school (disbursements). One Holiday Club Savings account. I only have about $4K in this system.

Auto Loan - Had a previous auto loan that was paid off due to total loss accident only months before. Not sure how exactly that affects personal finance, but it has not been easy to deal with financially. Current Auto Loan Balance is about $16K. Original balance was ~$17K with interest balance, been making payments for 6 months without problems.

Certificate of Deposit - Special promotional CoD Program of $1K (only 1 time $3.99 program fee) with accompanying checking account. Portion of my paycheck direct deposited over 2 years. Had issues with account fees but since resolved. This was my attempt at being proactive with my Personal Credit yet so far everything is going fine. The CoD matures in August so I will have access to those funds. I plan on closing this account. 

Student Loans - Approx. $17K debt. Subsidized and Unsubsidized federal loans. Unfortunately, I had $3K stolen from me that was set aside for repayment of these loans. Transferring to University soon and will require more student loans, no idea at the total as of now. I have a forbearance placed on these while I transfer from College to University. And, of course, deferment until I receive my Bachelors.

Expenses:
Car Insurance: $180/mo
Car Payment: $300/mo
Gas: $80/mo+
Cell Phone: $90/mo
Rent/Utilities: $50/mo++
Misc. Food/Entertainment: $100-150/mo+++
Online Subscription: $10/mo
Misc.: $20/mo++++

+Avg $20/week. Estimated since budget software is skewed. Cut back from $120 since the holidays.
++Used to pay $800+/mo thanks to unreliable roommates... so currently couch surfing. $50 is the least I can do for other's kindness..
+++Another rough estimate. Because of cutbacks, this estimate includes non-grocery lunch/dinners, bar tabs, snacks, etc. ""Healthy"" dollar menu and happy hour~
++++Misc for tolls and related little expenses.

There are some other expenses that I don't know how to quantify on a monthly basis. Mostly one time fees, random little-purchases, tickets, fees, etc. There's a few other odds and ends that are probably irrelevant. 

My long term goals are simple: I want to clear ALL of my debt, have a substantial savings, and have progressed Roth IRA. Investments. No current interest in purchasing a home, though.

My immediate goals is to clear my revolving debt firsts, refinance my auto loan, and grow my savings. I'd also like to open a Roth IRA this year. I've been contemplating saving some money on the side and look for some decent investment opportunities. 

My current plan of action!
I have been taught to always have liquid cash on hand. So my strategy so far has been to make my minimum car payments, reduce CC2's balance by $200-500 (depending on my cash-flow that month) and transfer the corresponding amount from/to CC1's balance every month, and of course pay my fixed expenses. 

New Game Plan?
I'm thinking that as soon as I have access to funds released when my CoD matures; I can take those funds, combine them with a little bit of savings, and try to completely pay off my revolving debt. I am not sure if I can clear the entire balance(s), though. I expect my liquid funds to be severely reduced and the recovery period may be a little tough.. but I think I'll be okay. Is this a smart move?

I'd appreciate any and all advice or tips the Reddit Community has to offer! Specifically regarding my immediate goals. 

Thanks!

TL;DR - Should I take my remaining liquid cash and attempt to pay off my revolving debt ASAP?

   Yeah, as most of the posts I've read through searching, if I had the opportunity to go back and not go to the private college I did, I would. But alas, what's done is done, and this is my current predicament. Any help/suggestions is greatly appreciated.

Facts : 29 year old male living in Florida (no state income tax), work as an entertainer at a venue. A significant portion of my income is tipped cash, while 60% is verifiable via salary. My salary a year is 48k-ish (dependent on how much I work....but I guess that makes it not salary. Oh well, you get the idea) ....and my cash intake a year is ~35k . I've also thought about getting a second job, as my 'main' gig only clocks ~30hours/wk. My student loan balance is 137k as of right now...that even hurts to type.

My current loan balances

Staffords at 6.8% balance at $18,173

Department of Ed (Consolidated Subsidized Loan) - 2.88% balance $3,719

Private loans (aka fuck Sallie Mae)

Loan 1 - $36000 at 6.5%
Loan 2 - $57400 at 7%
Loan 3 - $22000 at 8%

My monthly payment to SM are supposed to be around $1300/month. 

After finally getting a good job and realizing how dire my financial situation is (and wanting to burn down SM) , I decided it was time to make some real changes in the way I ran my finances. My mom was horrible with them, while my dad (divorced looooong ago) is great...I'm stuck somewhere in the middle - go figure.

A very close family friend had agreed to co-sign on my largest loan before it was issued (57k @ 7%) . Due to the nature of the amount of the loans, and SM incompetence it has put a strain on our relationship, which is outstandingly valuable to us both. They make a solid income that has got to be upwards of 6 figures, but is far far from wealthy as they have 6 kids and a money-pit of a wife.

Another close family friend who is very wealthy, my estimated net worth on this friend is upwards of $30M and that's being conservative. Anyways, they invested in a bank a long time ago, and I called to ask if they would make a phonecall to the bank president (a close friend of theirs) to ask if the bank would consolidate everything to a much lower interest rate, and to get the co-signer off my largest loan that's putting a strain on our relationship.

My co-signer had also previously said they would match 50% of everything I paid over-minimum on their loan. (Minimum is $600, I pay $800, they'd pitch in an extra $100 etc) . 

My wealthy friends value education greatly and stunned me to the point of tears yesterday, when they offered me $50,000 to help repay my loans. I'm blown away and still a little shocked. I informed my co-signer of this offer, as it greatly affects them as well, and considering his offer to half-match. My assumption was the cosigner wasn't expecting me to be able to pay off the entire thing at once.

If he were to still half-match, that would essentially be another 25k, but I don't near expect that to happen, as it is more than likely far over what he thought that half-match would do.

My priorities - Clear the loan with the co-signer to get things back to normal relationship wise with them. Although I don't know the amount he's willing to match, I feel confident that if I apply the entire gifted $50k to his account, he would pitch in the last 7-8k to get it completely paid off.

I realize respect and agree that after that start taking the extra balance and applying it to my highest interest rate loans etc etc, snowball the balance down...and give SM one final middle finger.

Questions are -
    1. If I call SM and offer a lump payment of 50k, would they be willing to lower the interest rates on the other large private loans, and/or balance. This was the idea of the people gifting me the 50k. From some research I've done that might be viable? Thoughts? Opinions?

    2. Any other ways to consolidate and/or lower my monthly payment and/or % rate?

    3. To my understanding, the new bill POTUS signed doesn't apply to private loans, am I correct? Are there any type of (legit) programs that do apply? My amount of federal loans is already lower than the 10% IRP required thing, even only considering the income I claim on my W-2 (45kish) . Do I have to make the 50k payment to SM, or can my friend to circumvent some tax-law bullshit? I'd assume if I'm gifted the 50k, that I'd have to pay taxes on it, thus decreasing the amount I could throw towards principal.

    4. Anyone have any genius ideas/thoughts etc? I don't have any other debt to my name. My student loans are enough debt for me.

    5. Is it reasonable to want to buy a house in the next 2 years? My main holdback has always been my debt/income ratio, which even FHA mortgages can't exceed 43% if my memory serves me correct.

   Any other advice?

personalfinance,To balance transfer or not to balance transfer?,"Hello PF! I have a question about credit card balance transfers.

I just got an offer in the mail today from BoA. I have a joint checking account there with my husband, and we both have credit cards there **(mine is unsecured, $1500 limit; his is secured, $500).** We pay these off in full every month. I also have a Chase Amazon card, whose limit has just been doubled to $3000. We will be unable to pay my Chase in full this month **(about $700)** due to helping family, which won't be paid back for several months if at all. **Chase has a 22% interest rate. BoA's is 19.99%.**

We are also moving at the end of September, so we'll have the costs of that coming up (we plan on getting a new bed for the new apartment). The offer is through August 15 and **there is a 3% transaction fee.**

* Should I do this? It may end up being two transfers, one before this month's due date and one before Aug 15.

* Am I correct that the BoA balance of a transfer won't have interest, but other purchases will if I don't pay off the purchases every month? Will my payment be applied to the balance that IS being charged interest, or split between the purchases and the transfer balance?

* Chase's due date is July 23. Does transferring the entire balance by then look the same to Chase as paying it? Does it look different to the credit reporting agencies?

I realize this will make my credit usage lopsided for a while, since we won't be using Chase at all until the transfer balances are paid off.

Other considerations: We will be getting student loans mid-August. We originally planned to use $1000 for moving costs and deposits, but that probably won't cover a bed as well. We can consider using an air mattress for a while until we can buy a bed straight out. The rest of the loan is going to pay off my husband's old debts, about $3000. We can throw about **$100 per month at the transfer balance** until it's paid off, so we will transfer no more than $1000 total.

personalfinance,Life after high school - college/university. Need advice.,"I just graduated from high school and currently provisionally admitted to a state university here in California. At first I thought I could afford it, but then all these charges came and I barely got any financial aid (~$5,500). $6,000 for dorm for one semester (due mid-July) and I'm about to go to an undergraduate orientation in a week where I enroll for classes and be charged even more.

I naively thought I could just get a loan and then pay that loan after I graduate but I was wrong. When I look into it, I was surprised by the very high interest rates. Now I'm thinking whether I should drop my admission and to just go to the community college 10 minutes away from home first.

My very supportive mother is giving me $10,000 for college which I thought I would spend on a car that I could use for work, but I had a change of plans once I found out about the interest rates on student loans. Now I'm planning to spend all that, along with the $5,500 I'm getting from financial aid, $5,000 from work-study, and $3,500 from a subsidized loan (no interest). 
Or, use part of that $10,000 to buy a car and part of it for enrollment in a community college.

- Would it be more practical of me to go to community college first before going to a university? 
- What are the pros and cons?
- How much does community college cost?
- How much would I save if I go to community college first?

personalfinance,"As someone under 24, is it smart to store my emergency funds in ibonds? Also, a few other questions.","From what I've just read [here](http://www.moneycrashers.com/series-i-savings-bonds/), if I were to purchase I Savings Bonds the purchase of the bonds would be under federal taxation. I'll quote just in case I am paraphrasing incorrectly,

""I-bonds purchased before your 24th birthday are automatically subject to federal taxation. You can use bonds purchased before this date to fund your child’s education, but you must pay taxes upon redemption, so there’s no compelling reason to do this. After your 24th birthday, you can set aside I-bond purchases for tax-free tuition for your child or legal dependent. You can also buy I-bonds to fund your own education, but they must be registered in your own name. And again, you must purchase the applicable bonds after you turn 24.""

What does that mean? The interest I would be earning on the bonds would be taxed or just the purchase of them?

Also, with the bonds maturing at 20 years, could I invest in bond at $833.33 every month for a single year and ""set and forget"" them for 20 solid years or until I need to cash them? In theory, I would be earrning interest every ""month"" on the reoccurring ibond, correct?

Abstract: 

&gt; The monetary transmission mechanism describes how policy‐induced changes in the  nominal money  stock  or the  short term nominal interest rate impact real variables  such  as  aggregate  output and employment. Specific channels of monetary transmission operate through the effects that monetary policy has on interest rates, exchange rates, equity and real estate prices, bank lending, and firm balance  sheets. Recent research on the transmission mechanism  seeks to understand  how  these  channels  work  in  the  context  of  dynamic,  stochastic, general equilibrium models.",finance,1404449668

personalfinance,"I want to start building credit. I went to my bank and... this looks suspicious, or dumb","Hi all,

I moved to the US 3 months ago. I've lived here before but only for short periods of time (3-6 months at a time) and never bothered with building credit. I'm entirely debt-free at the moment and I have more assets available than I should (i.e. I should really invest, but that's a different matter).

So I figured I should get a credit card in the US, ideally one that offers me significant advantages (cashback). For that I'll need a good credit score. I've been banking with Wells Fargo so far (because they were accross the street the first time I lived in the US, and I never bothered looking elsewhere before), so I went to my local WF and spoke to a banker.

I got the expected suggestion, get a secured credit card, asked for a printout of the details to reflect on. So far so good.

She then mentioned secured credit lines. This is where the ""this looks dumb"" part comes from - I give my bank, say, $10k, to secure a loan up to $10k, from which I can borrow interest-free as long as I repay when I get the bill (i.e. the next month). I can even take money out of it, put it on my checking account, and auto-pay the bill from my checking account. So basically I just need to create noise on my monthly statement and... I get a better credit score? For not spending money and just moving it around? How dumb is that?

The suspicious thing is, these $10k as a collateral are not accruing interest for me. Now I'm used to Switzerland's way of seeing things - when I make a deposit, I get it back with interests. Why would WF get to make money out of my $10k while I'm not even using it, except to move it between accounts? That's the first suspicious thing.

She suggested I get a ""CD"" and use that as my security. It's ""the same thing except you accrue interest and you lock your money for a period of time"". The fact that she wasn't able to tell me what ""CD"" stands for (apparently ""certificate of deposit"") or what the minimum/maximum amounts to deposit were is also a bright red flag. Also the interest rate is like 0.01% if I lock the money for a year and it's less than $5k, which seems laughable (it's 0.10% if I put in more than $5k, still bad).

I still have to go talk to other banks and see if this is the norm or if I can get a better deal. In the meantime, can one of you friendly folks tell me if this is fishy, dumb or normal? Thanks a lot!",finance,1404453624
dogecoin,"Dogelending - Use doge for organised, sustainable microlending","Hello, shibes.

We are at a stage when doge is not just a commodity being traded. People use it to buy pizzas, donuts, cars, games, stuffed dogs and creepy letters from Japan. We’ve used it to dig wells, sponsor circular-driving experts, build houses, send tropical countries to winter sports and even plan on using it to put robots on the moon.

There is, however, an area which we haven’t focused enough on: grassroots entrepreneurship. I’m talking about entrepreneurship that most of us will never see face-to-face. I’m talking about supporting people for whom financial inclusion beings at a mere $25. 

Dogecoin (and every other crypto, really) is perfectly suited for microfinance. We don’t have transaction fees. We don’t have to worry about payment processors or minimum pledge limits. We’ve been pretty generous with our money, even if the amount isn’t very high. If we shibes sitting in the comfort of our basements got together, we can raise enough to get started. 

My proposal is that we organise a drive together, and contribute to sustainable implementations of microlending. Three key words. **Organised** – because we can’t just throw doge at somebody individually and pray for the best (smaller amounts are inefficient); **Sustainable** – because we don’t want to lend to institutions that have shady practices or absent repayment rates; **Microlending** – while larger entrepreneurial projects can benefit from this, smaller ones are more manageable and have greater impact.

We do this in two phases.

**Phase 1:**

Pool doge together and send it to an established organisation. My research in orgs is ongoing and I currently have only two reliable candidates – [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/) (worldwide) and [Milaap](https://milaap.org/) (India). These have good repayment history and proper processes in place for lending, repayment and verification. But, they may not accept dogecoin. [BTC](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47792.0) and [Doge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1ye7ck/kivaorg_got_back_to_me_re_payments_with_doge/) have contacted Kiva in the past but they didn’t want to accept cryptos due to AML concerns and the fact that Paypal already waives all transaction fees. Milaap has the problem of the Indian government not being clear on their policy on cryptos.

So, we pool doge together, convert (hold with VC, convert through Moolah, perhaps?) and send it to an established organisation in fiat. I’m proposing a target of $5000. Back in January, this same amount was [raised overnight](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wj0r2/goal_reached_were_helping_indian_athletes_meet_up/). With the recent negativity, it's not going to be easy but it can bloody well be done. For perspective, $5000 could seed up to 200 separate projects.

**Phase 2:**

Apart from making the above recurring, we could work on getting these organisations to accept doge directly. Harder, yes, but much better in the long run. We could also look into doing the microlending ourselves but this is a huge and challenging task, and best discussed after and if Phase 1 goes off without a hitch.

**FAQs**

***Microfinance? Reddit has taught me it’s an absolute failure!***

No, it’s not. There are many concerns with microcredit, and these are usually because the blown up claims about gender empowerment fail to come true. Some organisations have opaque lending/collection practices which have led to [endless debt cycles](http://www.ibtimes.com/perils-microfinance-why-miracle-economic-strategy-winner-nobel-prize-failed-turn-poor-entrepreneurs), and many loans are given without [proper verification](http://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/CGAP-Technical-Guide-Due-Diligence-Guidelines-for-the-Review-of-Microcredit-Loan-Portfolios-Dec-2009.pdf). To avoid all this, we go through trusted organisations (like the ones mentioned) who have eyes on the field and have an understanding of [the risks involved](http://www.kiva.org/about/risk). Microfinance isn't a magical solution but there is evidence of it being a useful intervention in many settings ^[1](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/measuring-impact-microfinance-hyderabad-india) ^[2](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21600993-biggest-study-so-far-finds-microcredit-helps-poor-after) ^[3](http://www.cgap.org/blog/does-microcredit-really-help-poor-people) ^[4](http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance#IV) .

***Let’s bombard these organisations with mails and tell them to accept doge!***

Let’s not. We’ve received clear communication in the past. Don’t blame them for playing it safe. If we do want to convince them, let’s show them that there are hundreds of shibes currently excluded by their system who have still made an effort with contributions below their minimum pledge limit. Actions speak louder than barks. You can also join the [dogecoin community on Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/team/dogecoin) to show your support.

***Microlending? Does that mean I get my money back?***

Once repaid, your money can be reinvested into another project. Not withdrawing the money might seem like a downer, but you get to help many times more people than whom the initial amount was intended for. Besides, keeping track of cash in a pool isn’t practical.

***So, we give somebody money. How is this different from a sponsorship?***

Because we’re not doing it for TV spots. We’re doing what people do with real money – using it. It just happens to be through a method that encourages entrepreneurship around the world. Dogecoin is a currency and we're showing it being utilised as one.

***I’ve actually got more than just a few dollars/pounds/schmeckles. What else can I do to help?***

I’d tell you to read through [this article](http://www.ccpearce.com/crypto/social-experiment-kiva-bitcoin) and carry out similar initiatives. This is a great way to raise awareness about microlending and about the cryptocurrency.

***I’ve not really got any doge to spare. What can I do to help?***

Tell people about it and send them here. Talk to your friends and family about how a bunch of people on the internet are getting together to help somebody buy goats in Ecuador. Even if you can’t convince people to join, just raise awareness, or vote for the proposal (see next part). At the very least, leave a silly comment below.

***What happens if the community doesn’t rally behind this?***

I’ve been working on this for a while and I’m going to continue to do so. There have been people interested in doing this in the past and I’m fairly sure there will be support. There are shibes from /r/Dogecoin_PR who might be helping. 

**Bonus:**

A version of this proposal just got accepted at a UNESCO-backed youth entrepreneurship competition: link [here](https://www.youth-competition.org/groups/entrepreneurship-competition-2013/contests/2/1437). We need about 4,000 votes to be chosen as finalists in the top 10, and need about 30,000 votes to win the People's Choice Prize. So, even if you can't contribute financially to the project yourself, vote for the proposal.

I started this project because I want to see dogecoin recognised for the currency it is. We aren't just a community speculating on profits. However things go, I'm seeing this project to the end. I hope you'll stand with me on this journey to the moon.

financialindependence,Trying to reach FI with DC area cost of living,"My wife and I are both 30 years old and we have an 18 month old girl and plan to have another child in 2 years unless I end up losing my mind with the first one.  We just this year paid off all $14k of my wife's student loans (military paid for my college so no loans for me) and we paid off her 2.9% car loan of $12k.  We moved out of our small town home into a SFH with a yard and put down close to 15% with a VA loan.  We pocketed about $40k from our town home we owned for 3 years.  Between the HSA I still had and some insurance coverage, I put about $7400 out of pocket towards braces for my teeth, bought some furniture and home stuff, and I invested the rest and maxed out Roth IRAs.  Here's my rundown on my quest to retire early and reach FI.  I rounded some but hopefully my math is correct.



**Income:**

* My salary: $8519 take home/month
* Wife's salary: $1760 take home/month (Works 20-40 hours a week from home while she watches our daughter.  Used to make $40k/year in the office, but it's 2 hours away and daycare can be $20k/year here, so we thought this was a better solution for us.
* **= $10,279/mo. for $123,348/yr. take home**

**Worth:**

* $5k Ally Bank Savings emergency money
* ~ $120k Investments (Roth 401k, VTSAX, MGK, Vanguard Target date 2050 Roth IRAs).
* 2010 Sedan paid off
* 2011 SUV with $5200 left on loan
*  $590k Home value according to Zillow.  Bought in Dec 2013 @ $560k with Zillow estimate around $560-570k.  I didn't buy too much house, that's just DC area pricing.

**Debt:**

* Mortgage: $477k @ 3.875%, $472,800 left. $4800/year in taxes paid via mortgage payment, VA Loan, No PMI. $2693/mo.
* Car Loan: $5200 @ 0%. $473/month.  Will pay off in 11 months.

**Expenses:**

* $2,900	Mortgage (including taxes), HOA, Maintenance
* $799	Car Stuff: Insurance, Gas, E-Z Pass, Car Loan
* $47	Life Insurance
* $333	Child 529 Plan ($4k Virginia Max deduction)
* $253	Utilities: Electric, Gas, Trash, Water
* $161	TV, Internet
* $82	Cell Phone
* $590	Groceries
* $400	Lunches and Dinners Eating Out
* $33	Amazon Prime, Spotify, Netflix, etc.
* $615	Any other Spending, Shopping, Entertainment
* **= $6,213/mo. for $74,556/yr.**

**Savings:**

* $1,400 Roth 401k (couldn't do .5% for 12.5% for $17,500 and they won't cut my contributions if I hit max.  $800 not the end of the world)
* $1,166.66 Employer Match
* $916.66 Roth IRAs Maxed Out
* $1749/month left over cash that I'm not doing anything with.
* **= $5232/mo. for $62787/yr.**

	
Any advice?  I know I can cut restaurant costs because it's like 90% of me going out to eat for lunch every day.  Amazon prime, netflix, spottily, etc. are a big part of our family entertainment so I would hate to lose those.  We have a smoking deal on FiOS so I'm keeping that until it goes up in a year and then I'll re-evaluate what I need for TV.  Refinancing the house doesn't seem worth it because we're already at such a low interest rate and I don't want to pay closing costs.  If I save all the left over cash, I'm at about 51% savings rate.  Should that go to my mortgage and also my car loan payment when I pay off the car?  I'm making a killing in the stock market right now so I don't know that it makes too much sense to put the money at the 3.875% debt when I can make 12%+ in the market for now. 

Thanks for any advice, and all your stories are fun to read and very motivating!

personalfinance,Cashout refi to purchase income property?,"Hi everyone...
I'm juggling ideas on what to do with some equity I've got in my house and wanted to see what Reddit thought.

I am an active real estate agent and with the upswing in the housing market has been doing very well for myself. I have never seen myself as a top agent and honestly am not comfortable with the idea of maintaining my income at it's current.

A couple of years ago I bought a condo and have remodeled it which created a good amount of sweat equity. Recently I have been playing with the idea of a refi and pulling out approx. $75k of which I would turn around and purchase an income property (4plex or something similar). I am 100% confident in my ability to manage something like this and on paper the move makes sense.

By the numbers, the refi would increase my home mortgage amount about $300/mth. The rental market in my area is extremely strong and I would probably be able to find an income property that would NET $1000/mth after all expenses and the new mortgage payment.

This all sounds great, I now own, a condo and an additional asset, am covering all expenses with some buffer room and am taking advantage of the fantastic fixed interest rates which is something i preach to my clients. Being an agent also helps since I have more knowledge of the market than most.

My issue is that I am have only been an agent for 4 years and being 100% commissioned, it is very hard to plan for the future. I do not think I will sustain the income I've got now, and am not even 100% comfortable in my career. I've got no other debt so a move like this seems reasonable but should I take the gamble? What happens if the wheels come off and my income goes to $0? Should my fall back plan be selling, that seems a bit shaky...

This is my first post here but I've been going through a whole lot of others, and while I have a good idea of what I need to work on I'm not sure in what order/way I should go about working myself out of the hole my irresponsible younger self dug.  I have been working a full-time job for a year now, and I have been unable to save because of reckless spending and prior debts.  I finally got a budget, and have just last month taken up a second part-time job (I saw that advice on here about increasing income to increase savings/pay of debts more aggresively, so I did that).  I have now almost doubled my income while cutting down on food and entertainment costs, but with a rise of gas and insurance costs (I took a job as a pizza delivery driver).  So here's the breakdown.

**---------------------------------------------**

**Expenses**

* Rent - $400 (I am downsizing at the end of my lease in 3 months, should cut payment down to $300; I split an apartment with my brother)

* My Car - $263/month; $6300 left to repay; I have a payoff amount of $5100; APR 17%.  I got this loan a year ago after I had been out of work for a few months, then got a job but needed a car since it was night shift and buses wouldn't run that late, I had horrendous credit and I had shopped around, this was the only place that would even look at me.  And honestly even with the high APR, I am thankful for them taking a chance on me with my poor credit.  I have paid all my bills on time and my car, while worth only $2000, is going strong.

* Insurance - $100 (never even had a speeding ticket).
* Utilities (including internet) - $40-50 [Me and my brother keep the A/C and lights off a majority of the time].
* Gas - $300/month 
* Food - Maybe $20 now, I get free breakfast at the end of every shift at my full-time job (usually a full buffet, I actually throw out food I get for free because I have to much or it goes bad).
* Cell Phone - I am on my parents plan, it is $20 a month, they pay it for me, for which I am thankful.
* School Loan payment - $80/month
* Cigarettes - $140 a month  (this one hurts me to list, I have no excuses for this, it's stupid, completely unhealthy, and a money waste.


*Total Expenses* - $1343-1353

**---------------------------------------------**

**Income**

* Full-time job - $1071.84 /month after taxes (I get paid on the 7th and 22th of every month, sometimes I get an extra shift in on the months with 31 days)

* Part-time job - $~600/month after taxes (This does NOT include any tips I receive, and I get a bi-weekly paycheck on the 6th and 20th of every month, so same situation as full-time job)


*Taxable total* - $1671.84 without Tips added in


I get tipped via cash and credit card transactions.  I am tipped out at the end of each shift, all they do is say ""You owe the store X amount (the total of all cash deliveries you took"", then I get my credit card tips paid in cash, and I go home with whatever is in my wallet.  I'm not sure how to handle this tax wise, it just seems weird, I've been keeping all my gas receipts incase I need to do a 1099 at the end of the year and I can use it as a write off, same with mileage.  But anyways I usually make around $30-50 in tips for a 5 hour shift, every once in awhile I have a bad day or a really good day, that's the nature of the business though.  I usually work a 7+ hour shift on a friday or sunday and I usually make $70+ dollars on those days.  All in all I work 5 days a week right now there, so.....

**----**

*Total Tips* - $200-300 a week or $800-1200 a month.


**----**

**Actual Total** - $2471.81 - 2871.81


**---------------------------------------------**

**Debts**

* Car loan - $6300 left over 2 years, payoff of $5100 until I make my next payment on the 25th.  17% APR
* Direct Subsidized Loan - $3795 at 5.6%
* Direct Unsubsidized Loan - 2689 at 6.8%
* Direct Subsidized Loan - 1868 at 4.5%

*Total Debts* - $14652

**---------------------------------------------**

**Money in bank** - $200; no savings


 
**Credit score ~600**, it was around 615 when I checked earlier this month on Credit Karma, but then I checked again and it was down to 600, I know that's not a great score but I used to be at like 520 so I'm happy with my progress.



If you made it this far, thank you so much, here is where the meat and potatoes are.  

I need to develop a savings plan, while also trying to build my credit up.  Obviously I am building credit by paying my monthly auto and insurance bills on time (I think I am at least), but I would like to do more.  I need to refinance my auto loan, 17% if I can get a good rate I could probably save an about $1000 in interest that I won't have to pay.  I am going tomorrow (well today now) to inquire at banks about my options, but I assume my credit and very low value of my car will make this semi difficult.  I know I should start immediately on a emergency fund, but I also think I should look into getting a secured credit card.  So here is my plan right now, but I would like to know what the gurus think.

Assuming $1000 left over income at the end of this month I should do this
-Get a secured credit card with a limit of $270-300.  Use it to pay my monthly auto loan on the 25th, then on the 26th immediately pay of the balance.  I figure this would double my credit building efforts, am I right now on this?  Can anyone suggest a good card for this?

- Put at least $500 in a savings account, probably with my current bank (Chase/JP Morgan).

- If unable to re-finance auto loan by end of month, split the remaining $500 or so dollars equally between emergency fund and paying down auto loan.

- If able to re-finance auto loan, put remaining ~$500 into emergency fund.

I feel like this is a good plan, that focuses on creating a safety net while also trying to aggressively pay off my highest interest rate debt, or reducing my highest interest rate debt while also building my credit faster.  Am I correct or fooling myself?

personalfinance,Diving Deeper: Is it better to pay off student loans or invest your money?,"Forewarning, I have somewhat of a business background but this topic is a little over my head which is why I came to the experts here.


Anyways, I am going to graduate dental school in a few years with about $275,000 in student loans. I should be able to get a job paying minimally about $110,000 a year. The interest rates on the student loans are broken up into two categories the Stafford loan at 6.8% interest and the Grad plus loan with 7.9% interest. I obviously know that I should pay off the loan with the  higher interest rate first and foremost, but how fast should I try to repay these loans? Here are the things that are pulling me one way or the other:

1.) Dave Ramsey's belief that you should pay off all debt as soon as possible 

2.) If I invest more now wouldn't the future yields outweigh the extra interest I'll have to pay on the student loans? I've read that the diversified portfolio will most likely have a return range of 5-6% for the next 10 years. So on the surface it looks like this would favor fast repayment, but lets say it takes me 20 years to pay off all my student loans (as opposed to 3 with a fast repayment plan) but I allow my investments and continued investments to grow for 30 years wouldn't those yields offset the extra money paid towards the student loan interest? 

3.) Inflation. If inflation continues to rise for the foreseeable future wouldn't it be better to invest earlier and pay back student loans later on?

personalfinance,A Twenty-Something and his Fiscal Future,"Hi there, reddit.

The past few weeks, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and I have been considering a lot of options, mainly because I have a few left, and none of them are all too stellar. I mentioned it in a very ranting post in /r/offmychest, mainly because I was definitely running out of people to talk to in my own life. I don't want to burden my friends and family, who have their own nonsense to face, with my own, selfish, stupid issues.

Here's the thing. I'm a teacher, and because of my stupidity, I was let go by the school, and have now realized that, after various job interviews, I'm very much out of options for employment in my chosen field: education. I haven't any certification in my subject (Humanities, to make it general), and my finances are too low to get into classes. It's early July, and I have one or two prospects left, though I'm extremely nervous about them. If offered one job, I would be teaching at a boarding school. Great opportunity, decent wages, though I'm not totally thrilled about teaching at this school. Its clientele is just very different from that whom I've been teaching for the past year. Not better, not worse, just...different. I can't say whether the opportunity will be great for me, but...I don't know. The other I'll explain anon.

I am not entirely savvy in money, and I've looked at some of the posts on /r/personalfinance, and have just become incredibly confused by what I'm seeing. I know that our school matched me for a retirement fund, and, if I'm not mistaken, I have contributed 11% of my salary to a retirement fund. I don't invest (I haven't really much money to invest in anything), I don't think I have a 401(k), and the posts I'm seeing have genuinely confused me. My parents aren't necessarily the greatest advisors either, as my father has recently declared bankruptcy due to very poor spending habits and lying about them throughout our years together. Divorce payments, all that nonsense, don't help his case, either.

I use my father's financial difficulties to warn me about the dangers of spending beyond my means, but my very low income has made me resort to some pretty dumb practices, as well. I've opened a credit card for the first time (one that has an annual fee: mistake #1), and my bank charges fees **on top** of ATM fees and doesn't reimburse you (#2). I know what I'm doing is wrong, but I just seem to have no grip on my own finances. I don't spend much money on anything. Using Mint, I notice that about 55% of my income goes straight to rent (I live alone, and I prefer that, due to horrible memories of living with roommates in college and college/off-campus apartments), 30% to other bills and such (groceries, one small student loan that I need to pay back, utilities, etc.), and the remaining 15% is spending/saving money. With my income, it's chump change - so much so that the federal governments ICR plan says that my monthly payment is $0 for the next 16 months. It's a mixed bag, I guess. I have a little under 30,000 in debt from the government, ~5,000 directly from my *alma mater*, and ~500 in credit card debt. The latter debt will be paid in full in about two weeks, when I get my final paycheck from the school.

I am moving out of my apartment, but where to? I don't have prospects, so I can end up at home. That's a possibility.

However, two opportunities have arisen. Both of them will cost money, unfortunately, and I don't know what the best move is, given something that is putting everything in a pressure cooker.

I'm part of a program that stipulates that I *must* enroll in a graduate program for either an MAT or a PhD in AY2015-16. That means, for the next year, I need to find something that can help. Obviously, something that pays well is the most appealing, but the only two opportunities I have are MA programs. I applied for one of them, knowing that I'd also be applying for a job at the school that would provide housing, a modest stipend ($7,500 per semester, so $15,000 p.a.), and tuition remission for two courses per semester. I'd have to commit to the job for two years, but my MA program can be completed - if I work hard enough - within a year if I take an extra course here or there. I haven't received any word of that job, though, mainly because they couldn't consider me until I got accepted into the program. One thing's contingent upon another. I'm banging on doors just to see what the status is, explaining my situation, using my Dept. Chair's name as a reference (she has quite a bit of clout at the school, given that she was a prominent faculty member there before she left to teach high school), anything to get some kind of response. I have always believed in candor and in the mantra that if one knocks on enough doors, one will open. If no one responses, bang harder and louder. There's a difference between will and drive. If that opportunity does not happen, however, I will have to pursue the degree part-time, for three years, which I cannot afford to do. 

The other opportunity is the chance to travel to the UK to pursue a one-year degree. The problem? It's almost unfunded. I just made contact with the International Office (I sent them an e-mail explaining my situation and penchant to travel and learn abroad, particularly in the UK, where most of my topical interests meet), talked with professors and other people there about my situation, and spoke with various schools in the area to see if they would be willing to take a chance on me. It's harder for American students to get jobs abroad. I have good qualifications, however: pretty good ones, too, including prominent international awards and such. My school's alumni network isn't helping me, either, which irritates me immensely, since not many people at my *alma mater* are in my chosen field. The Career Center is also unhelpful, despite numerous appointments and conversations. The school in the UK is also very prestigious, and it can open a lot of doors not just in the States, but also elsewhere - Western Europe, Latin America, Australia, South Africa, etc. etc.

The only problem is this program. I have to matriculate into a graduate program, most likely a PhD (that was my preference) in AY2015-16. Part of me hesitates to make that commitment now, mainly because I want to explore and travel, find myself, all generic twenty-something things. However, is it worth it to pursue a dream if it will literally cost me my life? I won't be entering a lucrative profession one bit whatsoever, and I'll have to rely on the ICRP for the rest of my life. As someone who yearns to explore, however, is the one-year stint worth over twenty years of debt? I know that there is loan forgiveness for teachers, which I have considered and talked about with the federal government, but I don't know what is best financially for me.

I know this is a lot, and I sincerely apologize for any spouts of ignorance towards finances, or if what I'm mulling over is extremely stupid, because I know MA programs are moneymakers, etc. etc., but this one-year gap frustrates me. I have done work in service before, and I have absolutely **dreaded it**. I've suffered through it for many years, as both a high schooler and as a college student, and I just cannot afford to live independently on minimum wage. I don't really want to move home because I've already done the whole ""I'm-away-from-home-thus-I'm-independent"" thing for three years already; since my junior year of college, I haven't been home. I've lived in places for summer and winter internships and such all over the country. My employers there have also been very hesitant to reach out and help out, too. I'm just very stuck, and my ambitions really want me to explore myself.

But at what cost? What makes everything worse is that I need to make a decision by the last day of this month.

**tl;dr** Recent college grad struggling with ~35,000 in debt already is facing unemployment, but has been admitted into two grad programs. However, he is enrolled in a program that requires he matriculate into a PhD/MAT program in AY2015-16, so he only has one year to do this. Does he go to the prestigious program in the UK, go to a school in his local area where he has been admitted, or does he just go home, where he has not been for three years? Does he just save up, or does he take the risk and pay for the consequences, both literally and figuratively, later?",finance,1404547294
personalfinance,Four questions about Roth IRAs :),"I'm 25 and self employed and in school with no retirement fund/ira.

I just started a Vanguard index fund for $6000, and am planning on adding $3000 into a different index fund in a few days (so it'll be two funds total)

From my research, it looks like its possible to start a (free?) Roth IRA with Vanguard for the max of $5.5k.

So here are my questions:

1.) Can you only start a Roth IRA on or before April 15th of each year?  Am I unable to open and fund one right now?  

2.) Since I will already have two index funds, would it be difficult to convert (if that's the right word?) $5.5k of it into a Roth IRA with Vanguard?  What should I do?

3.) Once I get a job that matches retirement funds (or whatever is standard for most salaried jobs), will I need to do something with this Roth IRA like combine it etc?  Just want an idea of what would happen.

4.) Here is a quote from Vanguard's website:
&gt; 
&gt; What's the penalty if I take a withdrawal before I reach age 59½?	There are no penalties on withdrawals of your contributions.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a 10% federal penalty tax on withdrawals of earnings unless an exception applies.**

What does this mean?  Say I only ever fund it with $5.5k and earn $100 from the index fund.  Does that mean I can always withdraw that $5.5k that I put it in whenever I want and won't incur any penalty?  I will just have to pay a penalty of $10 (10% of $100) for the earnings?  And also have to pay taxes on the $100 since I withdrew before the age of 59.5?

personalfinance,"Should I pay off the loan with higher interest that's not in my name, or the loans in my name first?","Been spending a lot of time on the sub trying to prepare for my future. I  am engaged and we've been talking about about our finances and future plans, but we do have some debt.

The debt:

$20k in federal student loans in my name (ranging from 5-6% interest)
$35k in parent plus loans in my dad's name but I need to pay them (8.5% interest)
$12k in car loans with 0% interest because the loan is with fiance's parents - they paid for the car and he is paying them back (and we own another car outright) 

My dilemma is this: when my credit is pulled, only the 20k in student loans shows up on my credit report, since the parent plus loan isn't in my name, but I was planning to use the avalanche method and pay off the parent plus loan first, since it is the most and has the highest interest rate, even though it doesn't affect my credit score. Do you think this is the best plan?

My dad doesn't have very good credit (he shared a few credit cards with my mom and she racked up a bunch of debt... ruined his credit, but they are since divorced), so I'm not sure refinancing is an option for him. He doesn't have a mortgage (owns the house) but he has a car loan as well. 

Other details that might matter: 
Combined gross income: $115k
Emergency fund: $20k
Savings: $30k
Monthly expenses: $3,300 (includes EVERYTHING from rent, insurance, min. loan payments, cable/phone/internet) utilities, groceries, health&amp;fitness, etc.) 

We've been talking about buying a house, but it seems like we should pay down a chunk of this debt before we consider it. Anyway, what are your thoughts?",finance,1404563455

personalfinance,Credit to combat inflation (RU),"Hello from Russia. I would like to get a advice about idea to combat fairly high inflation with credit.
A little back story.

I'm debt-free with decent income and apartment paid off. I don't have a family and generally live pretty frugally so i save a lot of my income (50-60%).

Currently i have one year salary saved as my emergency fund in savings account. With recent events local currency lost 15% of value so i had to quickly convert all my savings to dollars and euros. Now it seems to bounce back but long term economy is bad with potential sanctions and stuff and volatility is very high. But my income in local currency so i have this idea instead of sitting on cash and saving for something just take a loan and paid it slowly with ""diminishing cash value"" from future income. It sounds good on paper if you managed to get a reasonable interest rate while inflation keeps climbing. But banks ain't stupid and we have pretty high interest rates, problem is i think inflation will keep climbing in coming years due to multiple reasons(i can expand on that if you interested) and saving doesn't make much sense. There is also risk of job security to consider - i am in IT so i think i will be fine. Also there is not much opportunities to investing. I don't want to invest in local stock market and local currency because they highly speculative markets and very dependent on local economy. Savings accounts in local currency offer below inflation percent to make sense, you can break even at best. So for investing there is only real estate which is usually growing in price and foreign stock market. These will be my long term goals but i don't have capital for those now. So for now i just buy foreign currency when price is right and put it in savings account.
Some facts:

* Official inflation - 6,5%(bullshit, prices rising constantly especially after Crimea, more like 10-12%)
* Central bank rate - 8,25%
* Average savings account interest rate - 10%
* Average mortgage rate - 12%
* Average auto loan rate - 15%
* Average consumer loan rate - 22%

So considering all this does it make sense to save for something? Maybe there is some historical data about this kind of stuff like in Argentina or something. What do you think?",finance,1404569293
personalfinance,Senior in College; Want to Begin Planning for When I Graduate,"I am about to enter my senior year in college.  I've been looking into a lot of financing stuff recently so that I am more prepared for when I am living on my own and such.  I never learned much from my parents, they aren't very good with money.

I understand that I should contribute to a 401k if my employer matches it, as long as my loans have less than 4% interest.  I will graduate with ~20,000 in federal loans.  About 5000 of that will have 6.8 interest and the rest less than 4.  Should I pay that off and then do that 401k and then create an emergency plan, and then finally worry about the other loans?

Also, I am becoming a teacher. With future plans to become a therapist.  I know that there is the PSLF program, but with my small amount of debt is it worth carrying all that debt for ten years just to have the rest taken care of by the government? Or should I just end up paying it all off to become debt free?

Also, there is a program for teachers who work for 5 years in a low income school that will cover 5000 of their student loan debt.  I think this is a much more viable option for me and makes the plan above less useful for me.  What do you all think?",finance,1404584442

personalfinance,Options for Refinancing Cornerstone Federal Loan,"My father took out a Cornerstone Federal Loan to pay for my school in 2004, by the time I graduated it was nearly 50k.  The loan is in his name only, and sits at 6.375%.  Right now it is roughly 42k.  I pay direct deposit into his account monthly, and then it is automatically deducted by the company.

I also have a private loan I took out for school, and also a car loan.  Together these equal roughly 22k total.  Most of it is the loan, the car was cheap.  I lump them because they both sit at 6% interest.

I will have both the Car/Private amount paid off in full in 17 months, all the while contributing 400 a month to the Cornerstone loan.

The problem I'm facing is that it is in my dad's name, I'm not getting any partial ownership of the credit benefits (which are admittedly not that big of a deal) and we are totally unable to refinance it to a lower rate, nor am I getting the tax benefits.  We can't refinance to anything better because it's simply in his name.  I am in the military now, and there are many other options for me in terms of how to repay this debt. I could even use the 10 year forgiveness if it were in my name, but as of now it's not an option.

Do I really have any options here in getting my name on the loan? Google searches have brought up nothing and the company itself isn't overly helpful.  Are there other types of loans with lower interest rates we could take to pay if off and then tie the new loan to me?  Home equity loans? (sounds like a bad idea).

I am working full time, but an entry level job in the entertainment industry doesn't pay great ($1800/month) and I'm in Vancouver no less so expenses can get higher than I'd like. However, I am still able to save between $200-$500 a month depending.

They borrowed different amounts at irregular intervals. They are now beginning to repay, so I want to establish exactly how much they owe.

I have a few questions:

1. Is this calculation correct?
2. Is there an easier way to do this calculation, such as a web application? I assume it would be similar to a line of credit.

personalfinance,"Student loan consolidation, moving to a higher but fixed APR?","I have student loans from four different providers. Making so many monthly payments is inconvenient but manageable. I'd like to make one monthly payment if possible, and maybe lower my rates and monthly payments.

I got direct-marketed by SoFi. They seem to have a decent rep, and they were offering a *fabulous* $100 signup bonus. Thought I'd give them a try.

I gathered all my loan balances and interest rates. The consolidated rate SoFi offered me at application time, based on my credit, blows away two of them. I'm interested.

For the third one, I have a fixed rate that SoFi doesn't come close to. I think I'll just keep that separate.

It's the fourth one I'm on the fence about. My current provider gives me a variable APR of LIBOR + 3.3% -- a nice 3.55% right now. SoFi can't match that in a variable APR. But they are offering 6.24% fixed for 10-year loan, or 6.625% for a 15-year.

The loan in question is a relatively large one. It's unlikely I'll pay it off in less than 10 years. That's a lot of time for an APR to fluctuate and become worse than the fixed APR SoFi is offering me. But I'm not sure how much volatility I should anticipate.

This fourth loan is also a private loan. I believe that means it's not as easy to consolidate it under favorable terms. So if I really want consolidation, I shouldn't be too picky. Is that true?

Bitcoin,Why I Would Never Use Bitcoin To Pay Off A Mortgage,"I had a few downvotes in the original post, but I think this really needs to come to bitcoin lovers minds.

You can skip my blah and go directly to youtube and checkout this 30 minute cartoon.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6zpfE7WjHI&amp;list=FLw8JxDJmNNfEgeUTUlVlo3w&amp;feature=share

It takes a little time to get your head wrapped around this (for me about 1.5 years) but when you finally realize that the banks counterfeit money, and give it to you for your mortgage, you will never pay your mortgage again.  and you most certainly will not give real value (bitcoin) to them.

A Loan:
I have a dollar I earned.  I lend it to you.  You spend it, then earn it with some penny's interest, and give it back to me.  This is how you and I loan Money.

Banks don't lend money like you and I do.  First, they take a deposit.  Then they Fractionalize it.  This means they get $9.00 for every $1.00 you deposit.  Out of thin air (well from the federal Reserve at 0%). They take that $9.00 And Lend back to you in a mortgage.

Do you see what happened?  They didn't use the deposit  - they still have the $1.  They printed money - at no risk - gave it to you for your home, and expect you to go EARN money and pay it back, with interest &amp; fees.  Ok - there is some risk - ever heard of a bank run?

personalfinance,Extra Money from Student Loan - Pay it off or invest?,"I'm starting college this year. As the first person in my family to go to college and move away to do so, we have no idea how much money we'll need for moving and ""startup"" costs. That being said, I took out a safe amount of money in a private student loan (outside the government loans I've already accepted) for any unaccounted for expenses. I expect between $2000 and $3000 that I'll have left over.

Here's my question - the private student loan accrues interest while I'm attending college for four years at a 4.74% interest rate. Does it make sense to take the extra money and pay it back into the loan immediately after starting college, or should I (conservatively) invest it while in college and hope for an average rate of at least 5%?

politics,Everything You Wanted To Know About The Hobby Lobby Decision (But Were Afraid to Ask).,"Hi there!  Since there seems to be a bit of confusion about this case, I'm going to take a bit of time (and inspiration from Unidan) and act as the excited lawyer to explain some of the finer details of this case so that at the very least people are mad for the right reasons.

(1).  **This decision had nothing to do with the First Amendment**.

I know it's kind of weird, because everyone is talking about it in terms of ""religious freedom"", but it's important that this is a case of statutory interpretation, not constitutional law.  Let me give some background.

The first thing you need to know is the term ""strict scrutiny.""  It's the analysis that the courts use when a law restricts or infringes on a constitutional right.  So, a law which limits free speech can still be constitutional if it meets three tests:

First, it has to be furthering a compelling government interest.  Second, it has to be narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Third, it has to be the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.

In *Employment Division v. Smith* in 1990, the Supreme Court held that a generally applicable law (basically, a law that applies to everyone) which happens to impede on religious practice is not held to strict scrutiny.  This overturned an earlier case (*Sherbert*) which held that even if the law isn't meant to restrict freedom of religion, if it *does*, it must meet strict scrutiny to be applied to that religious group.

So, Congress decided it didn't like the result in *Smith* and passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which basically said ""we're bringing back the *Sherbert* test, but as part of federal statute.""

The Court accepted that the government had a compelling interest. What the Supreme Court rejected was that the government's method of furthering that interest was narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means of achieving that goal. Why?

Because the government had already excluded a huge number of employers (and tens of millions of employees) from these provisions. A political maneuver to be sure, but it shows that the government believes it can further its compelling interest without forcing individual employers to violate their religious beliefs.

The ruling in this case was solely under the RFRA, not under any part of the First Amendment.  That's good, because it means:

(2).  **This decision does not prevent any states from passing similar laws**.

The RFRA, unlike the First Amendment, does not apply to state law.  So, where this result under the First Amendment would prohibit Colorado from passing a law requiring Hobby Lobby provide these forms of birth control, this decision does not.

(3).  **It doesn't mean that any religious belief is going to overrule the law**.

Remember that bit about strict scrutiny above?  Well, what the Supreme Court here is telling us is that the RFRA applies to closely-held corporations, and that the RFRA puts us back into strict scrutiny territory.

But, while the Court did not find that the government's actions were narrowly tailored enough, that is not necessarily true for any and all religious beliefs.  The people saying ""I'm suddenly religiously opposed to taxes and laws against insider trading"" are simply misunderstanding (or misrepresenting) what was at issue here.  Nor is there reason to believe that a religious employer could use this to avoid non-discrimination laws.

(4).  **There Is No Reason To Believe This Wouldn't Apply To Other Religious Groups**.

I know this one seems to contradict the previous statement.  But a lot of people have argued that by protecting Christian aversion to contraceptives while saying the case would likely be different if it involved transfusions or vaccines means that this ruling (and the RFRA) itself is an equal protection violation.

There is simply no basis for that argument.  The same ""sincerely held belief = RFRA = strict scrutiny"" analysis would apply to any other sincerely held religious belief.

And it's that last part (the strict scrutiny analysis) that Justice Alito was alluding to when he wrote that the situation would be different if it were vaccines and blood transfusions.  Not that the RFRA doesn't protect a Jehovah's Witness' belief that blood transfusion is wrong, but that when put into the three elements of strict scrutiny, it would likely turn out differently.

This case hinged (as mentioned above) on whether or not the law was narrowly tailored, and the idea that if the government can further its compelling interests without forcing the Archdiocese of Denver to pay for contraceptives it can also further its compelling interest without forcing Hobby Lobby to pay.  Other ways to further its interests without running afoul of religious belief = the way they chose isn't the least restrictive. 

(5).  **What About The Rights Of Female Employees?**

I hesitate to include this one, since of all of the already-contentious issues, the answer to this question it a whopper.  But it's also something a lot of people want to know about.  Whether it's phrased as ""what about an argument that the woman really needs the contraceptives"" or more irately as ""OMG the majority opinion didn't refer to women's rights even once"", the real question is ""why didn't the needs of women get more attention in this case.""

The answer is simple, but won't make anyone happy:  It doesn't matter.  There aren't gradations of compelling interest.  If the government has a compelling interest, it doesn't get bonus strict scrutiny points for having a *super* compelling interest.  The government's interest in making contraception available is already compelling, they aren't allowed to scrimp on making it the least restrictive means/narrowly tailored.  Even the most important interests the government has would be analyzed the same way.

(Ignoring, as basically everyone does, *Korematsu* which is an aberration where the Supreme Court held that a government interest could be so overwhelming as to trump any constitutional objections.  I don't want to get into that, but it's a really weird case that, amazingly enough, is still valid precedent).

(6).  **So, what can I do if I'm still mad as hell and not going to take it anymore?**

The simplest thing would be to lobby your state government to craft a similar contraceptive law at the state level (which would not be governed by the RFRA).  A harder, but still viable option would be to agitate for the wholesale repeal of the RFRA itself.  As a creature of statutory law, it's a lot easier to change than the constitution.

I would be happy to answer any other questions on this subject to the best of my ability.",finance,1404621345

I've been hearing people say, ""you have no evidence to support any reason that BTC will rise again like last year."" ""BTC is dead"", ""It cannot go any higher than last year"", etc. 

Here is my take on the 'bubbles' of BTC. 

'Past may not predict future', but what we are seeing here, recurring from year to year is an adoption curve set by people with differing technological inclination. It just so happens that it takes roughly the same time for each distinct class of intelligence to figure out what they're missing... The reason it retracts is because halfway through the adoption phase, there are people who have not yet adopted the BTC protocol trying to make quick change by buying, selling, etc. I hear 'market manipulation' and 'bitcoin is a bubble' almost everyday. I'm sorry you're not on the boat yet, friend. You'll be the guy buying in at 5k, selling at 3k, and spend all of 2015 pissed off and 'correct' that bitcoin was a bubble. Then you will miss the 2015 rise. It's a viscious cycle for you no-coiners, and for that i'm sorry. I just don't want to hear the screaming FUD posts on every news network ""I LOST MY HOUSE BC OF BTC"" by the end of this year. No, you lost your house because you still believe in the federal reserve notes. You lost your house because you were not thinking in BTC. Because we've told you time and time again. so when you're buying in at 5k, remember, you had the chance but you stand by the fact that a fully-transparent leger that cannot be unwritten doesn't have any advantage over the current monetary system. 

You believe that spending is actually good for the economy. Well, in today's infrastructure, you have to spend, because your money will have less power in the future due to inflation.

For high income earners, who carry a substantial amount of student loan debt, like doctors and lawyers, why not allow them to offset their large income tax payments with student loan payments?

This would grant them more financial independence and help them reduce their crippling debt, which in turn allows them to spend more money.

Longtime lurker first time poster. I've found lots of useful advice on P/F, but haven't found anything exactly related to my situation.

My problem is that I don't know what to do now. 

Here's the deal:

I'm 32 y/o, make 58k/year in Los Angeles. Right now, I have:

~20k in retirement accounts (IRA/401k). Company has no 401k match, so I've been putting $ into the IRA via Vanguard, thanks to P/F! IRA is already maxed for 2014.

~13k in a taxable Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund (for about 8 months now)

~$15k in an Ally savings account 

~5k in checking account

-No oustanding debts (Just a CC I pay off monthly)

-I own a 2004 Mazda

-I live at home with my parents and help them pay their mortgage, and other incidentals (bills, etc)

-Single

I feel like I'm in this in-between spot on P/F where I'm not in any crazy type of debt, yet at the same time not making a whole lot of money (particularly for my age). Budget-wise, I don't spend much outside an occasional splurge here and there (think running shoes, or an occasional starbucks coffee) and think I'm okay on that front. I passed a milestone of paying off my student loans a few years ago and am pretty happy with that. I've spoken with my parents about helping them pay off the rest of the mortgage but they're against it (won't go into details here). 

Basically, I just don't know what to do now. 

I thought about looking to buy a place, but the pricing here is so high I don't think that I can afford anything (Maybe a single room apartment I saw for ~250k?). I'm hesitant to put additional money into the 401k outside the ~10% of my income I currently do. I know I could just dump a huge chunk of my money into it, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking about saving for a house now. 

Regarding the Vanguard Account- the interest rate on a savings account was so low I put some money in just to do something with it a year ago and it's seen a bit of gains. I know this is a bit risky and have considered pulling out. 

Also there's the whole living at home thing. I know there's a HUGE stigma living with your parents, particularly for anyone in their 30's. I've lived alone before (in my 20's) and see myself as fairly independent in terms of any life experiences and/or growth that comes with it. I've traveled, worked in different areas, etc. I can't say I love or hate my situation now. It's been about 2 years and been okay, but I have thought about moving out again to a rental property as well. I moved back for a new job that happened to be very close to home. 

I feel like saving for a place is for some reason some milestone that's just next on the list for me to hit, but also see it as such a far-off goal given my current income stream I can't help but feel a little despondent. Should I just leave the money for a house in a savings account and continue to throw money into it? Anyone in the same boat? I just don't know what to do now. Sorry if this doesn't come off as a clear-cut question of how to invest $X amount of money or pay off $X amount of debt.

When my father passed away, I was gifted a car as well (a promise he made to me at 5 years old which my mother honored because she could afford it - get straight A's through high school, and I'll buy you a car). So I'm completely car payment and student loan free.

However, for the past 2 years, I've been living at home, helping my mother pay her mortgage and thinking I had my home situation set, I wasn't really paying attention to saving money myself. I have about $3K in credit debt across 3 cards with the majority of it being on the card with the lowest interest rate.

I'm now a new home [condo] owner, ($1300/mo including HOA). Ideally, I'd have liked to have saved more before purchasing my first home as it's eating a significant chunk of my savings, but due to issues at home, I was forced to find a new place sooner than I had planned. Since a 1br/1ba in a safe area nearby would have cost as much if not more than the 2br/2ba I have now, I opted to buy instead.

So I have a new place in the perfect location (less than 3 miles from work), and with it being vacant for nearly a year and a half, it needs a bit of work. My main goal at this point is simply making it ""livable"" - cleaning, removing the old pink carpet (for allergy reasons), and paint and getting the basics I don't already have like a sofa. Knowing money will be tight at first, I've been searching high and low for deals and come up fairly successful - a free fridge, significantly discounted flooring, and helpful hoarder family members who are giving me odds and ends like shower curtains and kitchen utensils to help with purchasing the more expensive things.

However, once that's all done, I really want to get my finances back on track (i.e. getting rid of my credit debt and getting an emergency fund back, and being able to save for the bigger purchases that are inevitable for homeowners).

Numbers-wise this is what I'm looking at:

Paychecks: ~$2400 a month
Mortgage + HOA: $1300
Bills + Utilities (Internet, Electric, Water, Cell Phone, Insurance): $550 *rounded up*
Minimum Credit Card Payments: $102

Roughly $450 left over.

I realize things are going to be extremely tight for a while. Thankfully I don't eat much, and I also don't go out too much either, so expenses outside of my bills are fairly non existent.

I've been lurking a bit on this subreddit and after reading the wikis my current plan is to pay off my credit cards, work on establishing an emergency fund (1 mo in checking, 2 in savings, and 3 in a 1% interest savings account online), and then begin saving a bit from each paycheck towards the bigger purchases for the home.

Any tips, ideas or suggestions for doing this most efficiently and quickly?",finance,1404685561

personalfinance,Refinancing a Cornerstone Federal Loan,"My father took out a Cornerstone Federal Loan to pay for my school in 2004, by the time I graduated it was nearly 50k. The loan is in his name only, and sits at 6.375%. Right now it is roughly 42k. I pay direct deposit into his account monthly, and then it is automatically deducted by the company.


I also have a private loan I took out for school, and also a car loan. Together these equal roughly 22k total. Most of it is the loan, the car was cheap. I lump them because they both sit at 6% interest.


I will have both the Car/Private amount paid off in full in 17 months, all the while contributing 400 a month to the Cornerstone loan.


The problem I'm facing is that it is in my dad's name, I'm not getting any partial ownership of the credit benefits (which are admittedly not that big of a deal) and we are totally unable to refinance it to a lower rate, nor am I getting the tax benefits. We can't refinance to anything better because it's simply in his name. I am in the military now, and there are many other options for me in terms of how to repay this debt. I could even use the 10 year forgiveness if it were in my name, but as of now it's not an option.


Do I really have any options here in getting my name on the loan? Google searches have brought up nothing and the company itself isn't overly helpful. Are there other types of loans with lower interest rates we could take to pay if off and then tie the new loan to me? Home equity loans? (sounds like a bad idea).

personalfinance,Need to talk through purchasing a condo and getting a 15 year mortgage loan,"Hello reddit! Long time lurker of /r/personalfinance, I enjoy reading the sound advice that's given here but it's time for me to ask for your assistance.

I'm 25 years old and I've been renting for the past couple of years. I'm looking at purchasing a condo for 140k and I've been seriously considering the 15-year fixed mortgage with 20% down payment. I've read the many threads and articles of a 15 year loan vs a 30 year loan. I want to lean towards getting the 15 year loan because of the lower interest rate - it shocks me to see the total interest paid for a 30 year loan. Not only that, but I do feel that I can afford the monthly payment and it would help ""keep me in check"" from overspending on food/drinks/luxury. I save, but if I had a low monthly payment, knowing myself I would fall victim to lifestyle creep. I also don't know much about investing and I often see that as a reason to go 30-year loan. Are these sound reasons to go 15 year loan?

Here's my breakdown:

* Annual Income: 80k (~$4000/month after tax)
* 17k 401k balance with 6% roth contributions

* Saved up: 20k (will be receiving a gift from family to cover the rest of the down payment)

* Debt: None (car paid off, no student loans)

* Current Rent: $1000/month 

Now that I'm shopping for a loan, I could do 30 year at 4.25% or a 15 year at 3.25%. With the 30 year fixed, My monthly payment would sit around $900 (tax +  HOA + insurance). With the 15 year loan at 3.25% would be around $1200 (tax + HOA + insurance). Comparing to my rent, it sounds reasonable but I know many people say the cost of ownership is always more than what people think so that worries me a tad. 

Also, I often see the advice of getting the 30-year loan but paying as if it were a 15-year loan. Again, my reason against that is having the higher monthly payment would keep me in check -  I don't want a situation where I allow myself to pay the lower monthly payment all because I want to do something like travel somewhere in that month. 

Maybe I've made up my mind, but its nice to hear different perspectives. Anyways, any insight would be greatly appreciated - thanks reddit.",finance,1404686715
personalfinance,"Fresh adult, made some bad choices and about ready to give up. 9,000 in late payments and debt and not making nearly that much.","Hey Reddit. I'm in my early 20's, female, and was kicked out of my parents house about two years ago. I moved in with my boyfriend, and things weren't too bad. At the time I worked at a very slow restaurant and made next to nothing, but could live still because my monthly expenses were also very low. I got a credit card for the sake of building credit (mistake) and after a couple of expenses continued pretty well with it and got my credit to ~750

I then quit my job and got a new one at a very busy restaurant where I made 100+ a day in tips, but it was a nearly 50$ cab ride there so I decided it might be time to get a car. Unfortunately my brother in law is a car salesman and convinced me that the best thing would be a brand new car. It was 14,000 and my credit got me approved for 2% interest. My payments are 250 a month. Insurance on the other hand was ridiculously high at around 500. 

Here's where my life shit itself. 

I got pregnant and no one was willing to help me through it. I got very depressed and was at the point of suicide. I stopped going to work, stopped paying my bills, and fell behind. My boyfriend then struggled to keep us fed and rent paid while I laid in bed and cried all day. 

I lost my job and my car insurance got canceled. I owe them ~$600 for the cancellation. I went three weeks without being able to get a new job, and only just found one a few weeks ago. 

One night my boyfriend had a very severe allergic reaction and I had to drive him to his parents house to get his spare inhaler (his died). On the way back I hit someone. It was stupid, I'm an idiot. I shouldn't have driven without insurance. The guy I hit agreed not to call the police and we've been in touch so I can pay the damages of his truck. The estimate was ~6k. I spoke to my family and my mom is going to put it on her credit card and I will have to pay her back for it ASAP. 

I fell so hard because of this shit show and I am now behind:

~400 for my phone bill (3 months behind)
~500 for my car payments (May and June)
~1500 in credit card debt, haven't been able to pay the minimum payment in months. 
~500 for my insurance cancellation.
~6000 to my mother for the car accident
~150 for two speeding tickets a couple months ago 

This makes ~9000 in debt. 

I make 

$9.05/h @ 6.5 hr average a day 
3-4 days a week = 180-240 weekly
x5 = 900-1200 monthly

I also make tips, which I haven't worked there long enough to get a real average weekly but it varies from 50-250 a day. I also spend 20 to cab back a day (~3am, no buses) 

I'm moving back in with my parents in September when my lease breaks, but until then I'm still stressing out hard. Bills are going to be coming out again this month and I can't expect my boyfriend to have to pay the whole of rent for the fourth month in a row. That adds another ~800 to my debt just this month. I'm so scared. I have no idea what to do or who to talk to. 

I've considered: 

A loan. I asked the bank and they said I'd probably be declined because my car loan was so recently done and they will ""want to see how I do with that before giving me more"". 

A credit card increase. Declined. 

Consolidated loan? I'm told that this would be a good option but I don't know what it effects. Will it pay off ALL the debt I've listed? I thought they only do credit cards, student loans, LOC, etc. I don't think they'll pay off my missed car payments and shit. 


TLDR; 9000 in debt very early in my life, no means of paying it off on time and scared to fucking death. What are my options?

electronics,Planning a 2x 0-40V 0-10A high-current bench power supply,"Greetings,

I'm currently planning a new bench power supply. It's meant to power all sorts of things, from small projects to big peltier coolers, motors and other sparky things. 

It's meant as a fun project that I design on my own, otherwise I'd just buy one and call it a day. Keep in mind that it's not my first custom power supply, so please don't tell me to make a lower-power one :P

I'm making this post to ask for opinions and recommendations, so feel free to throw those at me. 

The design goals are:

* Dual isolated outputs, each with
* 0-40V adjustable
* 0-10A adjustable current limiter
* reasonable precision for both settings


At this power level, linear regulators are a no-go. I first considered a microcontroller with PWM output, but then decided to go with a monolithic regulator instead. Plain PWM would make filtering harder and probably ruin transient response.

The power train goes through a transformer, rectifier and cap that first produce roughly 45VDC. That is fed into a [L4970A](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/sense_power/FM142/CL1456/SC355/PF63204), which is a monolithic switching regulator. I'll add a negative reference voltage with a 7905 to allow the feedback pin to go down to 0, as is mentioned in the typical applications of the 4970's datasheet: http://images.ges.cz/images/pictures/l/l4970.jpg

I have considered other switchers, especially some by Linear (LT1074, LT1170), but I'd have to run those in parallel to get the desired 10A per channel.

For current limiting, I'll add a [LMP8646](http://www.ti.com/product/lmp8646) current sense amplifier with a continuously adjustable gain. I can use it to override the 4970's feedback pin, thus implementing current limiting. [Sample circuit with different regulator](http://dangerousprototypes.com/2012/06/17/app-note-precision-current-limiting-with-the-lmp8646/). I'll use a 0.1Ohm power resistor as the current sense resistor to get better accuracy, and to aid in filtering the output.

The output filter shall be an RLC lowpass with aforementioned 0.1Ohm resistor, 1µH inductor and 100µF cap. That gives me roughly -30 to -35dB at 100kHz, which is my targeted switching frequency of the 4970. I don't want to increase the cap to keep transient response reasonable.

There will be two of these channels with galvanic isolation from one another. This way, I could put them in series and get 80V at 10A or in parallel for 40V at 20A. Yummy!

I'd like to know what you think and whether there are any obvious mistakes or potential problems. I also have some questions:

* To reduce noise, I'd like to run both L4970A in sync. They have sync pins for this, but that would ruin their isolation. Would optocouplers work here?
* Since they're buck converters, they should be able to provide more current at low output voltages than is put in (on average), correct?
* The 4970s are fed with a negative reference voltage. Should I hook up the LMP8646 to the same negative reference (i.e. its ground pin)? Would make sense to me.
* Should I omit the 1µH inductor in the output filters? That would reduce ringing, but at the cost of some filtering capability.
* Any other thoughts?

Thank you!",technology,1404727207

investing,Passive Income Series – Forex Trading – A New Investment Option,"Diversify your portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. How many times have you heard these statements? While these statements can apply to more to just finances, the chances are that you understand that it is a bad idea to invest all your cash in one stock, or put all your money into the same property - but have you really thought about a long term strategy?
Current bank interest rates can only be described as shocking. I read an article at work today that discussed how an Aberdeen Assets fund manager has stated that the safest place for savers to put their money is in shares. While this might seem like an outrageous statement to most, he makes a good point; investing money in a savings account is a pretty bad idea. Given the current rates of inflation versus the interest rates… you are guaranteed to lose money.

What is Forex Trading?
Forex Trading is something we have all probably heard about at some point – perhaps through an advert in the Financial Times or a money magazine of some sort; but do you actually know what it means? Forex trading is the trading of foreign currency (hence the name foreign exchange). Essentially, you buy one currency with another – the idea being using the fluctuating currency conversion rates to your advantage.

Success Story – The Accidental Pay Day
I have a great personal example of how you can make some serious money on the Forex markets. My uncle and his family live in the US after he emigrated over 20 years ago. After leaving the UK, he sold his property and left a large sum of money in a UK bank account. He owns a project management type business and a few years back had to transfer a large sum of money as collateral for an insurance bond – essentially he had to use the nest egg as a guarantee against the insurance policy for a job. He transferred the money from GBP (British Pounds Sterling) to USD (US Dollar) at a rate of approximately $2 for every £1. £80,000 of savings became equivalent to $160,000.
Now he kept this money in the bond to guarantee the insurance for about nine months and transferred the cash back to his UK account shortly after. He thought nothing of this for about a year, until he received his annual interest statement for the UK bank account. Can you imagine the shock (and delight) upon finding out that £80,000 was now over £100,000!? Now I can assure you that the bank didn’t decide to pay him 25% interest, but instead the foreign exchange markets had changed significantly: £1 to $2 had become £1 to $1.50. A case of trading the money at the right time – Had it been the other way around, he would have made a significant loss!
 
Who is Forex Trading For?
The simple answer is everyone! Anyone is able to trade in foreign exchange, but those who have interests and investments in multiple countries had a slight advantage as they can trade between bank accounts. For example, if I have investments in the US (or at least in dollars) and in the UK, I could benefit from having assets in both currencies and move funds when the markets are advantageous to your positions, but there can be significant fees associated with this technique. Others will use Forex trading platforms to convert money between different currencies with the intent purely to make money – i.e. there is no practical reason (like to invest in a property) for converting from one currency to the other.
 
Like anything else, Forex Trading has a level of risk associated with it. There are many resources online where you can learn about the principles of Forex and trading within the market. I highly recommend that you do some reading and research before jumping in – You can lose money as well as gain through trading currencies. That said, if you are totally risk adverse, maybe the low-interest savings accounts are a better option. You have to be prepared to lose some (if not all) of your investment or play. Similar to the stocks and shares, some currencies are more stable than others – politically unstable currencies are far more likely to fluctuate than the US dollar.

personalfinance,Should a make a move on purchasing a home when housing prices keep rising (bubble scare) or rent and wait?,"My main hesitation in purchasing a home is the fact that housing prices are rising dramatically in the area I wish to purchase (Minneapolis Metro area). The home I wanted in 2011 in golden valley is now up in price by 30%. Also, interest rates are rising. Do I pull the gun now before they keep rising or do I wait until the next bubble pops? Is there going to be a next bubble?  so many questions. 

Here are some facts/stats to consider: 
-Annual income of 95,000
-Single
-Supporting one child - payments of ~ 650 a month
-No Car or Student Loan Debt (or debt at all). 
-Bring home 4,983 a month after 401K/Roth/Deductions/taxes
-Current savings is 1,000 (I have spent the past 6 years paying off 60,000 worth of debt and threw all my extra cash towards it) 
-current rent is 735 a month. 

I am a minimalist, and value my time and have little clutter. due to this, I have am happy with my place right now. There is very little to maintain/don't have to mow/replace furnace/fridge etc. It is 700 sq feet and is more than enough space (for me) for now. 

What is most important to me, in life, from a ""things to do"" standpoint, is to be able to have enough income to give myself the basic needs (basic food/shelter/replacement clothing) and have money left in order to entertain myself (try a new restaurant once a week, go out once or twice a week etc)  and take an occasional vacation without having to constantly budget and monitor my finances or skimp. I have calculated that in order to live that lifestyle, I need around 60 dollars a day (after all fixed expenses).  Also what is important is to have ""my own home"" and especially a place for my little one (he is 2 now) to run around/invite his friends over/have his own room. 

I can save up the necessary 20% down payment in around 3 years,  at which point my income will rise probably another 10-20%.  

Problem is, I am struggling with choosing the right time to buy a house.To be honest, I would be perfectly happy keeping my same living situation right now for another 3-4 years and buying the house later. however, I fear that once that point comes housing prices will be through the roof and the house that was 175,000 in 2011 and is 225,000 now will be 275,000 in 2014. Do I pull the trigger now out of fear of rising prices and move into a house (which I wouldnt mind but I am happy with rent now), or buy a house when I myself feel ready but risk paying a couple hundreds dollars more in mortgage?",finance,1404750380

personalfinance,Mortgage/PMI question,"Hello! I have (I think) a fairly unique question regarding my mortgage. My (then fiance) wife and I bought our house in Nov 2012 with an FHA loan. our loan was ~126k, house bought for 129k. Our interest rate was fantastic at 3.125% for a 30 year loan.

Obviously since it's an FHA loan we have a PMI payment that runs about $130 a month. At the time I bought the house I did not realize (and I keep kicking myself for this) that you are required to pay PMI for a minimum of 5 years even if you pay down the principal to 80% of the loan value before then.

So after I realized this I stopped throwing in extra principal with my mortgage payments, seeing that it wasn't worth it since I couldn't get rid of PMI for 5 years regardless of what I did. I began putting about 1k a month into a moderately aggressive mutual fund with the intention of using that money to pay off the mortgage entirely. My income was relatively high at the time I bought the house (~80k) and has increased to 115k plus significant bonuses on top of that. Add to that my wife has graduated and will start a job as a teacher making ~35k this fall, I plan on saving 1.5 or 2k a month in this fund. I figure the money in the fund should earn me ~7% and thus it'll be better off there than put towards the mortage since my interest rate is so low, even after taxes. I have 119k left on the loan right now, and I have a little over 18k in this mutual fund. An added benefit of investing the money is that it is liquid - if I put it towards the mortgage it's forever gone.

I feel like I should also add that I have a sizeable rainy day fund (~12k). And I know that there are varying schools of thought about paying off your mortgage early, especially with such a low interest rate, but I personally can't put a price on knowing I am completely 100% out of debt.

I am hoping that I can save enough to pay off the entire mortgage at or before the 5 year mark. I have a few questions:

1) Is what I am doing even remotely smart? Would it be better to just put the money into the mortgage?

2) If I do manage to pay off the entire mortgage before the 5 year mark, will I still be required to pay the PMI? It seems ridiculous that I would have to pay the PMI when there is no more loan to 'insure', but I know how the bank loves to take your money.

3) Is it even worth negotiating with the bank? If I called them up and said 'I can give you 20k today if you get rid of my PMI' would that ever fly?

4) I ran the numbers a while back and I don't think it's worth refinancing, especially since mortgage rates have gone up. Is this correct?

personalfinance,Choosing a new bank based on their cards,"Hi PF, I am pretty fed up with U.S. Bank. I've been traveling for about a year, and my card constantly gets declined. I'm gonna give you a quick overview, then what I've been looking for, and hopefully some of you have better personal experiences to share. I don't mean to be rude, but if you do not travel, please say so. The main reason I am frustrated is travel related. I'd prefer to not switch and run in to the same problem.

Quick overview, I travel quite a bit, and I call my bank every time before I leave. I tell them I'll be in a different state/country (slightly different for country) every time, and they confirm that they will put a travel note on the account. I've put myself in a routine of landing, finding a gas station or something cheap, get declined, listen to the card company be confused and flabbergasted on me being declined, then get approved. This takes about 15 minutes, but it ensures that the next purchase might go through. I then go to dinner, it goes through (most of the time) then know the next purchase will be declined, so I go to a cheap place and spend another 15 min getting setup for my second purchase. My record so far is 7 calls in a 5 day trip. 

I've been searching for places that have a little less retarded fraud block, or none at all. I only carry one card on me (I know, traveling no no) and I prefer to not carry cash. I've heard of cards that text you when something is flagged and you can confirm/deny the purchase. I've also heard of banks that allow you (debit only) to remove the fraud prevention services. 

I'm done with all of U.S. Bank because of many other reasons, but this is the biggest reason. I will not go with Bank of America, or Wells Fargo. I am open to many others. I have researched Centris, and Mutual First, but I do not know their travel/fraud policies yet.

personalfinance,Help managing long term student debt through college and med-school,"I will be starting college this upcoming August and I would like some advice regarding long term loans. As I'm still waiting for my school to process need based grants based on my most recent FAFSA update, I haven't taken out any loans yet. With the original estimated cost exceeding $28000 per year, I'm not sure what approach to take. I did relatively well in high school and with AP and placement tests, I currently have 30+ credit hours applicable towards my graduation. My major will allow me to graduate in three years if I thoroughly commit myself. While that will help reduce overall tuition costs, I still have the massive costs of med-school to account for. 

My financial situation isn't great. I do qualify for the subsidized Stafford Loan as well as the Pell Grant. The general advice is to take out as much federal loans as possible so that's what I plan to do. How should I cover the remaining costs ~$14000? Should I take out private loans? I'm hesitant towards Parent Plus loans as it may hurt my parents' credit if something goes wrong. I'll be preparing for the MCAT as well as taking roughly eight to ten classes a semester to begin with so work time will be limited.

I'm willing to make all the necessary sacrifices and give it everything I've got. I'm sorry if this makes me sound like an idiot but I just want to know whether this plan is financially possible.

Freshman year, I will try to cover as many of the required med-school courses as possible, plus other required gen-ed courses. I have a decent understanding of chemistry, bio-chemistry, biology, and physics from AP and self-study for academic competitions in high school so the material won't be completely new. Sophomore year, my main focus will be studying for the MCAT. I plan to start applying for med-school as a junior in college. I'll get my general education requirements covered and I will be eligible to graduate the following May. Most of my junior year will be devoted to med-school applications and working to pay off as much debt as possible.  

My main concern at the moment is managing monstrous amounts of med-school debt on top of the debt I will have collected by the end of college. With part time work I'm expecting around $60000 debt by the time I graduate. I'm not sure what med-school I'll end up attending but $70000+ a year is a reasonable estimate. I've read a lot of information on repaying federal student loans but I'm not sure how to approach private loans. They seem to have very different repayment options compared to federal loans and loan forgiveness doesn't apply. I'm relatively certain that I will have to take out private loans at one point or another and with the most recent post about whether med-school is worth it, I'm seriously concerned about my future outlook.

Also if I have the credit hour equivalent of a sophomore, does that increase the amount of federal loans I am eligible to borrow or is it still $5500? I've tried to do as much research as I could but I'm honestly lacking the ""big picture"" of what to expect. Can I realistically secure a part time job while I'm enrolled in med-school to help with the interest that's building up? Can someone please point me in the right direction or give me an overview of what to prepare for? With classes starting in a month, I would truly appreciate any guidance or advice.",finance,1404770378

personalfinance,"Defaulted on Education Loan with AES/Charter Bank, can I get GradPlus loan?","Hello -

So long story, a relative convinced me to get a student loan right as I turned 18. They needed help upfront and would ""pay me back"" for it. They cosigned, it was approved, and long story short: their business went under and they ended up going to prison for 5 years on fraud, etc.

I'm now in my mid 20s and starting med school in September. I've been able to get the subsidized and unsub federal loans so far without a problem, but I'll need more help financially and want to do the Grad Plus loan.

I've researched around a bit and from what I understand the grad plus is a federal loan but credit based. My credit is currently around 690-720 depending on CC utilization that month, but I do have the AES/Charter Bank ""Education Loan"" negatively marked on there and not set to fall off till Oct 2016.

I tried about a year ago to get a private loan through sallie mae and was rejected. I don't recall specifics, but it may have been due to not having a cosigner, but my fear is that it may have been from this AES loan, so now I'm worrying that I won't be able to get the GradPlus loan now.

Will this impact my grad plus loan eligibility since it's technically not a student loan? My understanding is that student loans can't be defaulted or fall off from your credit... so I feel like this is a private loan thats been tagged as ""educational"" now and will cause me to lose eligibility.

Is grad plus just purely credit score based?

What options, if any, do I have in order to try and remove this or maybe change the status from educational to pirvate, or remedy this situation?

I'm honestly stuck. It's a lot of money. A lot. I can't pay it back, I don't even have money for my day to day right now, and can't get into payment arrangements or anything. I don't even know what questions to ask or how to go about this.

dogecoin,The Doge Manifesto - How to move forward with style,"The Doge Manifesto

1.	Stop being mean. Remember good Karma makes good Karma and the same is true for bad Karma – we don’t want to become a community that implodes on itself and becomes feral – that does not attract good people.

2.	Remember your roots – tradition is a great foundation for going forward. So we need to get back to what we did best at the beginning – some great fundraisers. We need to identify some important international community projects and then get on board – and regularly like every 3 months or so. And as a reward to all those who gave – maybe we could create an electronic page where their names a permanently left (even have Platinum Donors, Gold Donors, Silver Donors for those donated a certain amount) 

3.	Spread the love – if all you do is hoard you might as well put up a sign that reads “here lives Scrooge McDoge”. Maybe some more community competitions eg: short stories, poetry, artwork, etc. (And market the idea in a place where the rest of the community knows it exists). Maybe we can have a Spread the Love page at Doge Foundation HQ.

4.	Send each close friend you have on face book an email with the Doge program to start their wallet and a 1000 Doge start up plus a web list of where to go to tip and spend the cash. If everyone at the community did that to just 20 people then we would be 2,000,000 people better off as a community. Maybe we can have this as a competition. Those that get the most have their names in a top 100 list or something.

5.	Go West. California has just agreed to recognise electronic currency as real currency (don’t know the details). If people can identify companies in California and get them to set up Doge as payments – it will start making the rest of the USA take notice; a bit like the prohibition days – once some states legalised alcohol again, the rest followed – irrespective what the Feds wanted.

6.	Appoint a business round table from the community to come up with a DOGE business plan an how to push the currency forward.

7.	Find an alternative to needing mining to move the blocks around. The truth is with computers becoming faster and faster – is it possible to have everyone who has doge be part of the process more effectively? I do not know how this works, but while the community is beholden to those outside of it who only want to make a profit out of the process, the currency will never reach its potential.

8.	Be patient (and don’t give up) – Rome wasn’t built in a day and it took Bitcoin 5 years to where it is now not 5 months. We need to move effectively forward with hope in our hearts, not fear or greed. As the community grows, and as crypto-currencies become mainstream, we need to be positioned well enough to meet the needs of those who want to get on board. People will look, and will ask – we need to be ready to show them the way.

9.	Be Real – altruism is important ; getting a community going around a currency is not just about trying to make money by buying Doge, it is also about creating a network of minds and views outside of the physical borders of one nation or another. We nedd to start talking about other things than just Doge, Doge, Doge – otherwise Jackson is right we will be sounding like a cult selling a product to that hopefully we get rich or something. I prefer to pioneer ahead and see what a community around a meme or currency can do to make the world a better place.

personalfinance,"What kind of work can I do from home that has a relatively low start up cost? I don't need to make much, but I do need change in my life","**Backstory** (if you don't want to read all this skip to ""current situation"" below): I used to be bad, real bad. I made A LOT of mistakes when I was younger, hung out with a really really bad group of people, and generally just fucked up in life for a long time. I graduated high school when I was 16 and chose not to go to college, because I was too busy being a scumbag with my ""friends"" and I thought I was ""too smart"", so stupid when I think about it. I've dumped money into drugs when I had a problem with addiction, I made more money than I knew what to do with but I spent my life looking over my shoulder because of the way I made it. 

Fast forward 5 years and most of those people I hung out with are either dead, in jail, or so far down the road of addiction that there's no coming back. This will not be me. I cut them all off four years ago and have been sober since then (from what I was addicted to at least). 

Two years ago when I was 23, still living with my dad, I had to find a place of my own because my dad sold his house and I didn't want to move an hour and a half away. This is when my problems started.

At that time I had a credit score in the mid 700's, now it's somewhere in the 500's. I had to rely heavily on credit during this time and went from having 0 debt to 5k just like that. I've managed to settle on one of those accounts, so now my debt totals 2.5k. 

**Current situation:** Since I don't have a college degree, or a considerable amount of work experience I can put on a resume, finding a job is tough. I recently decided I need to go to college, for me. I can't afford it right now but it's something I'm trying to fit into my life. I'm working on a novel at the moment but that isn't going to do shit for bills. I do work at a retail store doing markdowns, which means I wake up at 3-4 am and go scan clothes until 11 or 12. I've been working there for about a year and a half. The pay is okay at $12.35/ hour but the problem is I barely get hours. My last paycheck was for 25 hours. That's for two weeks. I've been breaking my back every month just to make rent, which isn't bad for my area at $500, but when you're making next to nothing and have a hungry stomach it becomes a daunting number. Work has also become unbearable because of the managers, but that's a different story. I just can't live like this anymore.

On to my question, I'm looking for something I can do from home that has a relatively low start up cost. I'm only good at two things, and that's fitness/nutrition, which I don't have a certification or degree to prove, and another is writing. I used to edit and grade college English papers when I was 15, but that doesn't mean shit because I don't have a degree to prove it. I'm not afraid to put work in, I'll do whatever it takes and don't need to be restricted to stuff that only involves writing or fitness. Like I said in the title I don't need much, I can honestly survive just fine off of $1000-$1500 a month, though the former would make things harder, it can still be done. I feel like I'm so stressed out and fed up that searching for options is leading me to nothing but more frustration. I refuse to go back to my younger days and make money that way. Even though I can solve all my
problems and go back to being comfortable in a short amount of time, I refuse to do it. I feel like I would be cheating myself to take the easy way out and I've done that long enough.

Forex,My Thoughts On Trading Forex For A Living,"One very common question I’ve gotten is: “Can I get good enough at forex trading so that I can do it for a living?”  The good part is that people who ask this question are probably positive and hopeful people, but are probably also lazy (read: they just want to quit their job more than they want to get involved in the FX markets!)  The bad part is that my answer is usually disappointing, since attaining mastery in trading, as with any skill, involves work.  I’ve observed a high failure rate of new traders due to a lack of time or motivation required to work on getting better.  So in this post, I’d like to address a few different ‘paths’ that can act as the answer to this question, and offer you some ideas for how you might go about becoming a full time trader (or not!)

**Mastery &amp; Science of Trading**

First, let’s think about forex trading as a skill, and compare it to other skills out there – like astrophysics, basketball, or ice climbing.  Obviously, these are varied examples, but would you expect to be able to compete at the professional level in any of those skills without training, and years of practice?  Of course not!  If an aspiring medical student told you that he wanted to be a doctor, but he wanted to just watch House M.D. for a month and then start doing surgeries, you’d probably not let him operate on you.

So get it straight – becoming great at forex trading is going to require either 1) a couple years of experience, at least, and 2) high quality education or an environment that is highly conducive to your success and knowledge (such as a trading floor or brokerage firm).  Unless you have prerequisite skills that will lessen the learning curve, expect to put in the time to nail down the basics and know what you’re doing.  That’s not to say you can’t open an account and trade small lot sizes after a few weeks of preparation, but it does mean that you should not expect greatness for some time.

In sum, to trade forex or any other financial market for a living, you’re going to need to invest a lot of time and to gain serious knowledge.

**Refine the Dream**

As I have found out myself as my track record grew from “nothing” to “3 years of solid returns”, one of which is posted on this website in the performance section: trading for a living means a lot of different things.  First of all, when I hear the phrase “professional trader”, I think not of some guy in his living room who clicks a few buttons in the morning and does no other work.  I think of a corporate forex hedger, an execution trader or FX advisor who also places client orders.  That’s someone whose profession it is to trade.  There are certainly people who decide that they want to only trade their own account and live off the profits, but let’s unpack that ‘ideal’ and lay the parts in front of us.

Let’s say that you are only trading forex, full time.  What else are you going to do?  Are you going to start a business, join a foundation, travel, pick up hobbies?  What are you going to do during periods of natural drawdown in your strategy?  Will trading be your only income stream (not diversified at all), or will you have other methods of increasing your assets?  These are questions that only become apparent, and demand answers, when the possibility of forex trading for a living becomes a reality.

As the head trader at PoseidonFX, I could trade full time right now, and be just fine.  With a few different accounts running different strategies, it wouldn’t be a problem to live off the profits.  But for me personally, the time is not right.  Everyone’s reason will be different, but I would like to accumulate more trading capital first, and also to expand into different industries.  Into technology angel investing, real estate, equities, and more.  Others have a pie-in-the-sky goal of wanting to tell their boss to screw himself and to walk out and never go back to corporate America, and that’s okay, too.

Your reasons for wanting to trade for a living are probably different than mine, but I ask only that you understand exactly what you will need and what you really want for yourself.  Here’s a “packing list” for how to do this.

**You will need to invest:**

1. Sheer quantities of time.  Less, if you educate yourself in an efficient manner
2. Money (a few thousand to start, ideally $70-200k+ as your total bankroll when you’re going strong)
3. Mental energy and a thick skin.  You don’t get put out or offended if your brilliant idea is actually horrible when tested

**You will need to obtain:**

1. A forex strategy that works, that you understand and that makes sense for you (we can teach you how to come up with one, if you’d like!)
2. Maintenance knowledge, for how to fix the strategy if/when it breaks
3. Knowledge of markets as a whole, especially in FX and to some extent bonds/interest rate swaps.  Understand randomness, basic economic principles, and how other asset classes move.
4. You must enjoy following and discussing markets, otherwise trading is going to bore the hell out of you!

How it will look when you are a profitable trader, with the option of forex trading for a living:

1. You probably won’t want to sit at home, just trading and doing nothing else.  What else are you going to do?  Will you run a business, increase your focus on hobbies, or something else?
2. You may want to consider managing funds.  Don’t even think about doing this unless you know you have something good to offer your investors, but CTA/CPO registration is not impossible, if complicated and a serious undertaking  (If you’re outside of the US, this is far easier to do!)
3. It will definitely not be what you thought it was.  Being a profitable investor is more like having clarity of mind and ‘unconscious trading competence’, rather than living on cloud 9 off the excitement and thrill of profits.  See it for what it is.

**Can it be done?**

Yes, sure – why not?  There’s nothing stopping a smart and hardworking person from achieving what they want.  Statistically speaking, if you’re reading this, you aren’t a person who is seriously considering trading for a living.  And if you are, statistics and our understanding of human nature show that you probably won’t make it.  And that’s fine – not everyone should trade capital markets as their profession!

A select few, however, will have this dream, and will have the energy and competence to make it a reality.  I was once just a guy who read about FX and was intrigued, greedy, and hopeful, but I put enough work into it to “pour concrete into the mold”, and change my world to fit my dreams.  I happened to be profitable from my first year onward, and that is not impossible to do.   I need to stress that FX trading is not for everyone, and does involve serious risk if you take it lightly.

We at PoseidonFX ask that you be ultra-realistic with your goals, seek a formidable education from qualified professionals with verified performance records, and don’t be afraid to take intelligent, well-calculated risks along the way!

Bitcoin,"Roger Ver, the self-proclaimed ""Bitcoin Evangelist"", fails miserably at Bitcoin evangelism and is an embarrassment to the Bitcoin community","Here's a message from the decentralized Bitcoin community for Roger Ver, the self-proclaimed ""Bitcoin Evangelist"":
When you publicly advocate support for Ross Ulbricht, who is charged with numerous serious offenses (money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and planning to kill 1 person), you are NOT at all being helpful to the Bitcoin cause.
Needless to say:  Bitcoin already has a fairly sullied reputation due to its early history of association with criminal activites (e.g., Silk Road).  We are reminded of this with nearly every media story related to Bitcoin.
But the fact that Roger Ver not only doesn't help to improve this reputation but actively compounds it with ongoing support of Ross Ulbricht is staggeringly foolish (particularly for someone who claims to want to help Bitcoin succeed).
Let me put this plainly:  Most global citizens (and prospective Bitcoin users) DO NOT support criminal activity or people who help facilitate criminal activity or even people who are charged with facilitating criminal activity.
If you do support that sort of thing (you might call it libertarianism, though others would call it anarchism), that's your choice.  But if you think you're going to encourage (and not hinder) prospective Bitcoin adoption with that point of view, then you are completely frigging deluded.

A few details that may help explain the motivations of Roger Ver:
""May 2, 2002   The United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California announced today that Roger Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for selling explosives on the online auction site, eBay. The sentence was handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel following a guilty plea on one count of dealing in explosives without a license in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 842(a)(1); one count of illegally storing explosives in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 842(j); and one count of mailing injurious articles in violation Title 18, United States Code, Section 1716. Mr. Ver, 22, of San Jose, was charged in an information filed in federal district court on August 8, 2001. According to the plea agreement, Mr. Ver admitted to engaging in the business of selling explosives without a license from January 1999 through August 2000. According to the information and plea agreement, Mr. Ver sold explosive devices described as “Pest Control Report 2000” on the online auction site eBay. He purchased approximately 49 pounds of the devices from a supplier in South Carolina, and sold at least 14 pounds of the devices to bidders on eBay. While engaging in the business of selling explosive devices, Mr. Ver stored the explosives in a residential apartment building and mailed the devices via the United States Mail in a manner contrary to Postal Service regulations. Judge Fogel sentenced the Defendant to 10 months in federal prison, a fine of $2,000, as well as a three-year period of supervised release. The Defendant will begin serving the sentence on August 2, 2002. The prosecution was the result of an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.""

Is it just a coincidence that Roger Ver, a convicted felon, who was prosecuted by the U.S. government, is supporting Ross Ulbricht, who is similarly charged with serious offences by the U.S. government?

Is it just a coincidence that Roger has renounced his U.S. citizenship and is currently selling citizenship in St. Kitts for Bitcoin?

No, I would say that is certainly not a coincidence.

I would say that it's fairly clear that Roger Ver (aka ""Bitcoin Jesus""):
a. strongly dislikes the U.S. government
b. has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to circumvent U.S. laws for his own personal gain
c. has demonstrated his support of others (e.g., Ross Ulbricht) who are alleged to have circumvented U.S. laws for their own personal gain

In summary:  As a self-described ""Bitcoin Evangelist"", Roger Ver, you are a complete fail.

May I recommend instead, if you are truly interested in advancing the Bitcoin cause around the world:  Just STFU and stay out of the headlines.  (Contrary to your delusions:  You are actually an embarrassment and a negative drag on the Bitcoin community.)",cryptocurrency,1404802164

personalfinance,40k - Manage the savings for a project (world tour) - Canada,"Hi guys,

My first post ever on reddit even thought I'm on it since a year.

I'm writing to you to have advices concerning managing the money I save every month towards going for a sailing world tour in around 3 years.

I'm pretty aware of much of financial things and how to manage my day to day money but I think I can optimize things concerning theses savings. I'm french (as from France) but living in Canada and all my savings are here with me.

So as of today I have :
- 10 000 in a no tax account (limited to an addon of  5000 dolalrs per year and once you take it out the limit is not modified) at a rate of 1.20%
- 21 000 in another account (taxable) with an interest rate of 1.30%
- 7 000 on my daily account for which I get free banking services if I leave on it 3500, the 3500 spare is for my day to day life if there is any problem.

Therefor I'm searching any account or method that I havn't thought of. At least half of it can be blocked 2 years (all I have seen by blocking it this long is no gain in the interests). I've already gone in stock market before (and bairely winning a bit of money which is not so bad) but I don't want to risk this money for one of the big dream of my life.

So if you have any advice I would be really grateful :).

Thx !

She will be using the subsidized and subsidized Stafford loans. She is still quite a bit short. 

Do we go for the Parent Plus or something like Sallie Mae? We have decent credit, I would guess around 730 so we might get a better interest rate with Sallie Mae. I also don't like how with the Parent Plus loan, I am 100% responsible for it and it won't qualify for the income based repayment plan if she were to need it. 

Parent Plus is a fixed interest rate. Then there is the whole deferment situation. We don't have a lot left at the end of the month, but I don't want her having a huge payment when she gets out either.

* Would there be stock exchanges, forex, hedge funds, etc?
* How the un/employment would look like?
* How would (private) ownership look like?
* How would be natural resources allocated/distributed?
* Is the system working anywhere already? Where and with what results?
* Would you enforce such system around the globe? Why? Under what authority?

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation/transfer - Fixed or Variable?,"I'm looking into transferring or consolidating (however you would word it) my private loans with Sallie Mae to Wells Fargo.

Here are my current loans with Sallie Mae:


Amount | Interest Rate
---|---
$13,120.98 | 9.75%
$9,034.89 | 8.25%
$5,311.10 | 10.75%
$3,954.83 | 8.25%

**Wells Fargo is offering me:

Variable Rate: 4.0% (0.00% Origination Fee)

Fixed Rate: 7.49% (0.00% Origination Fee)**



I am currently only making minimum payments on these loans of $314.59 as I work on saving up to move across country (better job opportunities) and then I plan on knocking these out. It's worth noting that I have another $51k @ 6.625% in federal loans currently on IBR with a monthly payment of $220.58.


Will the fixed rate even save me money? I plan on hopefully being able to bump the monthly payment to $700/mo. I did use unbury.me and it seems like by doing the consolidation I lose out on the ability to knock that $5k loan out quickly and risk paying more in interest over the 4 years it'd take me to pay it off. But I also won't be able to start making this large payment for maybe another year. Hopefully I can pay even more per month with income increase, but it might take time as where I am moving is a slightly higher cost of living as well. But what about that 4% rate? It seems too good to be true?


Based on this, the prime rate hasn't really changed at all in the past 4 years and this will also allow me to keep paying my usual $315/mo and save even more money on interest (or contribute to savings faster). 

http://www.moneycafe.com/personal-finance/prime-rate/


I was really stupid in taking out all of these loans and spent the first 3 years of having the loans not caring about them, basically accepting that I'd owe forever (and about 8 months of that on forbearance). But I know now that's not the case, which also has been helped by getting a higher paying job and I really want to pay them off as quickly as possible so I can move on with my life debt free (this is the only debt I have; no car payment, no cc debt anymore [tackled that first], and I rent).

Would it be best to take the 4% rate and then continue with my plan of paying them off as quickly as possible? As this will save the most money and avoid the most risk of the prime rate increasing? 

I currently have about $3k saved up, plan to get to around $8.5k before moving with a cost of about $2-2.5k to move (including move in costs to new apt) and then saving back up to about $8k for an emergency fund. My take home pay is currently $3,175 per month after taxes, 401k contribution to employer match (2% - currently at $600 in there), and $79 insurance (med, dental, health, life is free).


If you need anymore information, please ask.

personalfinance,"When purchasing a home, consider an adjustable rate mortgage (but do your research!!!)","(not a shill at all, just relaying some experience after buying my second home [for reference, I'm only 30 and I am NOT rich])

Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser, and an ARM might not work for everyone (we don't plan on staying in this house more than 10 years, if that). I'd just never even though of this until our realtor went over different mortgage types with us.

READ THE TERMS OF THE LOAN!!!  Some ARMs will adjust monthly, and have a 10% increase limit. Some are not tied to anything and can be adjusted whenever the bank decides to.  We got a loan through Capitol Federal (they're not national, but they hold property loans in 47 states).  The terms of the rate were such:

2.68% interest

Loan can not adjust more than 2% a year (up OR down).

Loan can not adjust more than 4% MAXIMUM for the term (up or down [so, the max we'd pay is 6.68%.])

Loan is DIRECTLY tied to the [LIBOR rate+2$](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor) (so they can't just randomly decide to hike interest on you)
 (EDIT: link to the site so you can do your own due diligence instead of taking me at my word, https://capfed.mortgagewebcenter.com/)

***Benefits***: Lower monthly payments for the first 5 years, which is when the balance is the highest.

***Cons***: Higher overall payments if you only make minimum payments.

However, the benefit that you can see would be when you get an ARM and then pay what you'd pay on a normal 30 year loan.

For example, a 30yr loan is at 4.125% right now. That means that the payments for a 5yr ARM would be about $125 a month less.  If you simply add that $125 a month to your monthly payment (remember, you're not paying any more than you would be on a 30yr mortgage if you add that in),  you'll be paying the ***same*** as you would of a 30yr loan with higher interest, but you'll be paying off the balance quicker, which means less interest overall.

I did some numbers and a [30yr loan you will pay $113,200 in interest charges](http://i.imgur.com/783TrQp.png) over the life of the loan.

A 5yr ARM like what we signed ***in a WORST CASE scenario*** [means that we'll pay $111,800 in interest](http://i.imgur.com/T9FyRyN.png), so a $2000 savings.  Not only that, but you'll pay off your loan in 24 years, giving you 6 YEARS of mortgage payments to save/invest/whatever (again, this is 100% worst case where the loan us up to 6.68% after 7 years. It's been 5 years since LIBOR was over 2, which means our loan at that level would be 4.68%. My figures from here on our are worst case on the loan. The average LIBOR for the last 12 years is barely 3%, which would put our interest at 5%)

In the first 3+ years of the 30yr loan, [your interest every month is going to be right around $500 a month](http://i.imgur.com/uH1IMJn.png).  On a 5yr ARM, [it is right around $300](http://i.imgur.com/hM6w62S.png).  If you REALLY wanted to accelerate the loan payoff, just add in what you saved on interest to your monthly payment and you'll be WAY ahead of the game (again, this is money that you pretty much would be on the hook for anyway).

Even if you didn't make those extra savings payments (AND worst case scenario happens), the interest paid on the 30yr loan will [catch back up to the ARM by month 275](http://i.imgur.com/vkr10Bd.png), and by month 314 you'll be paying TWICE as much as you would on interest for a [5yr ARM](http://i.imgur.com/LOHAru7.png).

Once again, these are worst case numbers.  If LIBOR holds low and we average 4.68% interest for the life of the loan, our interest payments drop to $83,000. Or, a $30,000 savings.

OR, if the worst case happens to you, you have a $125 a month buffer (extra payments) that you've built into your budget and you don't HAVE to pay that extra.  Something that you can't do if you're paying on a 30yr fixed.

Again. ARM is not for everyone, but not everyone should instantly dismiss it.",finance,1404851377
personalfinance,IRA Confusion - Help,"I've read a lot about IRA's and understand their tax implications, but something still confuses me.

What do I do with the money that has been invested in an IRA?

They also offer IRA certificates that offer a fixed interest rate depending on the length of the certificate.

The IRA certificate makes sense to me, but the interest gained by just leaving money in the regular IRA account is minimal.

Are you supposed to funnel money into an IRA account (like the one offered through a credit union) and then invest that money elsewhere, like in another investment vehicle?

If so, how does that work? How do you withdraw the money without tax penalization to invest elsehwere?

3 years into 30 year FHA mortgage.

Original loan was $160200 on $166000
FHA loan at 4.75% interest rate with the minimum down of 3.5%

I've made many extra payments and the principal left is now $136000.  

I have a PMI payment of around $115 each month that I hate!!!!


My mortgage provider said they could refinance me into a conventional mortgage and discounted me a bunch(Military) on closing costs. I was quoted closing for about $1050 after discounts and appraisal.  They could put me in either a 4.625% at 30 year or 3.75% 15year.  According to them, I'll re-coup the refinance just from no more PMI payments in less than a year!  The bad is it is a tiny rate change.  Am I crazy for thinking of refinancing to that 30yr just for that????

Some other pertinent information:
Based on my current payment plus extra principal I could easily do the 15yr mortgage payment however I'd like to reduce monthly mortgage payment.

Ideally, when I end up selling the house I'll have kept more in principal than lost in interest.
I likely won't stay in this house for more than 3-7 years since I foresee needing a larger house.
Last thing to note would be I could consider possibly keeping it as a rental to generate passive income however I'm really warier of this decision as I would hate to get calls in the night about some problem at the house.  Perhaps hire a company to manage it if I were to do so and if it is profitable.

dogecoin,An important piece of advice to mining shibes,"Hey shibes! 

I know that there have been advances made in dogecoin miners, ASICS, etc, fairly recently. I'd like to give you guys a heads up on a fairly serious issue that has arose on the bitcoin-end of things as far as ordering miners, particularly preorders.

Let me start off by saying that I mine mainly Bitcoin. Around February, a company called Black Arrow offered preorders for a new miner that ran incredibly fast and was extremely cheap for the price. I had heard people say to be very weary of preorders due to the BFL incident, but I decided to invest in one of these anyway. After shipping costs, it came out to just above $400. Also, I ordered through a US reseller called Minersource who has contracted with Black Arrow, who was China/Hong Kong based. 

So we waited for shipping which was only a short time away. Every week there were production updates, which were slowly pushed later and later in the week. Issues were found with the miner, and things needed to be fixed. It was supposed to be a plug-and-play miner, with wifi, LCD, the whole works. It seemed that each week a new issue was found that pushed shipping off a little more. Support tickets were filed with little to no answer, and people began to get angry.

Now it is July. Black Arrow is just now beginning to ship their miners, incomplete and not to spec as they were advertised. Difficulty has increased to the point where the miners are now obsolete and will not reach a ROI. People are livid.

**TL;DR:
Company advertised a great product. Product created was not what was ordered. Product wasn't shipped until after it became obsolete and people lost a lot of money.**

Now that I've told my tale, how does this have anything to do with dogecoin? Because ASICs and such are so new for doge, I don't want any shibes to run into this issue.

**Do not pay money for a pre-order for any miner. No matter how great it looks.**

A lot of people were caught in this mess with Black Arrow, and they have lost so much money. Some people tens of thousands of dollars. The people who ordered directly from Black Arrow are left in a horrible situation where they wish to sue, but either cannot afford it or cannot due to jumbled up international laws. If a class action lawsuit was formed, the company would most likely dissolve and close its doors with no one receiving a dime. Luckily, because I ordered through Minersource, the US reseller, I have a little more protection on a refund, and had put in a request as of last night. Hopefully my ticket will be processed soon. I hold no ill will towards Minersource, as they have been put between a rock and a hard place, and hopefully they will make the best of a bad situation.

I beg you shibes, heed my warning and learn from my mistakes. Don't allow yourself to be fed lies and get scammed. Order items that are already made and in stock. I know there are predatory companies/people out there, and I could easily see something like this happening with the production of a dogecoin miner. 

If you see something like this, be weary and let a fellow shibe know the risks. We have to look out for each other. :) Best of luck to you guys! 

EDIT:
I just received a reply from Minersource stating that they are no longer refunding orders. Looks like this shibe will be talking to her lawyer. *sigh*",cryptocurrency,1404860927

Would it be a bad idea to roll all of the personal debt that's at a higher interest rate into the mortgage. I'm able to make double up payments on every pay period and it goes directly against the principal of the mortgage (meaning $11,000 a year extra, directly against mortgage)

Suggestions please? I'm not very savy with finances and I've been trying to pay off the credit line as quick as possible but I feel like I'm living pay cheque to pay cheque trying to do it. 

EDIT: I seem to have gotten confused about the home equity loan. What I wanted to do was move my personal debt onto my existing mortgage so that it was all in one place. Then I would have extra money to make double-up payments on my mortgage (extra $423 bi-weekly vs roughly $750 that I'm paying bi-weekly on loans).

personalfinance,"200K in Private Student Loans for a Music Degree, do I go back to school for IT to defer $1,800/mo payments + get job that will pay off loans?","Hello, I'll try to keep my life story as short as possible,

I went to one of the best music schools in the world in May 2013 on 200k of private student loans for a degree in audio engineering. I got a job working at one of the best studios in the world with Billboard 100 artists in LA to find all the assistants/runners make $8.00 an hour, and engineers only make $25.00 an hour if they're lucky enough to be put on a session where the artist didn't bring their own engineer (which happened 90% of the time), in which case they're demoted to assistant at $8.00/hr. Spent $300/mo on gas commuting 1hr each way to the city from my parents house. It was a dead end job with 7 day/week 12-16hr graveyard shifts and the occasional 20+ hour shift.

I was in AP Calc and Physics in high school and was previously enrolled at Penn State for one semester for Computer Engineering, dropped out and transferred the credits I completed to ""FOLLOW MY DREAM!!!""

Monthly payments are from two private loans, one clocking in at $1,300 a month on forbearance until September, after which it will not be defer-able until it's paid off, no exceptions including school. This one can be deferred longer if I'm enrolled in a college BEFORE this coming September, in which case it can be pushed back up to 7 years past the date the loan was taken out in Spring 2010.

Second loan is $475 a month, have been making regular payments on this one. Currently working at Target living with parents driving my car from high school. I only make ~$500 a month from this job. So far I/my dad have not missed a single payment on any of the loans.

EDIT: I should add my interest rates are 3.6% and 3.9% respectively. Consolidating would raise them to around 4.1%

I've been building and repairing computers and setting up networks since the age of 13 and already had a job as an IT manager for a local business over a summer between college semesters. Will it be worth it to attempt to take out MORE loans to go back to school to get a second bachelors in networking/IT in a gamble to pay off my current loans?

Would the oil fields in North Dakota be a better option?

Some form of bankruptcy?

Can't leave the country, parents cosigned (obviously).

Dad makes ~$140,000 per year (UPDATE: Actually ~$200,000 per year) as a biochemist but due to poor financial choices by himself and other members of the family we are barely getting by (EX. didn't have enough money to repair a stove burner that broke last week).

""Why can't your cosigner pay?"" and an extra $1,300 a month on him would force us out of our house/cars might be repossessed etc.

I feel as though I am now responsible for the well being of an upper-middle class family of 5 including my 12 year old and 17 year old sisters at the age of 22, directly out of college, with a worthless degree and no work experience, due to a combination of my adolescent stupidity and their financial stupidity/belief in my dreams. I'm willing to do whatever I need to now to try to salvage the situation but am stuck in a rut and have no clue what to do next.

I would greatly appreciate any and all advice.

TL;DR: How best to deal with 200K, $1,800/mo in student debt with a useless degree?




------UPDATE 7/10/14: First and foremost I cannot begin to thank this community enough for the helpful advice and the collective time people have put in to write extremely helpful responses. I have responded to as many as I can.

I will go into detail more about the family situation for future readers:

Mom went $60,000 into credit card debt by repeatedly opening cards, maxing them out, and never paying them back. When collectors began to make threats dad bailed her out with a $60,000 private loan.

Dad took $300k out of his 401k to put a massive down payment on our new house in California, which we moved to from Pennsylvania (hence the Penn State connection) in November as he was unemployed for two years after a site shutdown, and finally found this job here in CA. This extra $300k was noticed by the IRS and they demanded $70,000 immediately with no payment plans available.

Dad spends lots of money on the house considering every dollar put into the value of the house a ""good investment."" We purchased $10,000 worth of tile flooring a few months back because the cat peed on the carpet and he couldn't stand the smell which would not come out.

Between these things and the general cost of food + car insurance (he pays mine as well) + other living expenses + his assistance on my $1,300 per month loan before we put it into forbearance, at the moment we are barely scraping by on a 200k per year salary. He always complains that as soon as he receives a paycheck it is immediately gone and we barely have enough left for food.

Hopefully this clarifies a few things.",finance,1404901941

personalfinance,Bought a car last month - 2 hard credit inquries by US Bank,"Memorial Day weekend I bought a new F-150. While at the dealership, Ford gave me the honor of a 'Tier 0 Interest Rate' (their lowest). They said my rate would be 6.9%. I gladly turned that down and went with a 2.9% rate that US Bank offered.

That day, I received a hard pull from US Bank and Ford, no big deal, as expected. Fast forward to this week, I still have not received any notification from US Bank about any payments due, any account information, etc. I e-mailed the dealer and he said he would look into it for me. Yesterday, US Bank pulled my credit AGAIN, according to Credit Karma and Capital One's Credit Tracker. 

I know it doesn't affect things too much, as this month I've had 2 inquiries dropped from my report, but does this allude to the fact that US Bank may have messed something up along the way?

solar,Thoughts on installing small PV and expanding over time?,"I've been looking around to find an answer and mostly succeeded in adding more confusion, so I thought I'd try asking here.

We would like to install 6W system but that doesn't fit the finances.  No desire to lease, but the federal tax credit doesn't do enough to make it affordable for us at this point, especially with the question about carrying unused portion forward past the 2016 expiration date.

Partner's income is stable and something we count on to pay the bills while mine is from self employment projects that pay off in large checks with a month or several in between.  We'd rather not take on a loan at this point if it can be avoided.

What I'm wondering is if it is possible/practical to install 2W system now as that fits our budget - then upgrade it as my checks come in over the next year or so?  Can the inverters be sized to do that or would we basically be installing another whole system later on?",energy,1404911637
personalfinance,Refinancing Home,"So, my wife and I would like to refinance our home. Our current mortgage is through Wells Fargo at an interest rate of 5.5%. We bought the home in December 2007, and refinanced in 2009 (which turned out to be a mistake). The home is currently valued at $380,000. We have $320,000 remaining on the mortgage, with a monthly payment of $2,363.75 (taxes are relatively high where we live). Because of the intermediate refinance, we are not eligible for HARP, which is disappointing. However, the rather aggressive lenders from LendingTree and other websites seem like they would be willing to refinance our home. We're not underwater, but lowering our rate would really cut our payment (or, we could keep the payment steady and refinance to a 15 year loan). 

So, I need some advice -- should I seriously consider the LendingTree types (Wyndham, CBC, etc.)? Or should I get an offer from them and take it to WellsFargo as a bargaining chip? Any other suggestions on how to lower the interest rate? I'd really like to have a mortgage through a reputable and reliable company. Thanks PF!",finance,1404915330
personalfinance,"Have an extra $17,000 every year. Pay off mortgage, rental property, or max out my 403(b)?","Hey Reddit.  I am a two year lurker and first time poster.  I am a 30 year old teacher and my wife is a 27 year old teacher's assistant.  Together we make $75,000.  We do really well at living below our means.  Each year we have an extra $17,000 to get ahead and build wealth. We have no CC debt and one year worth of emergency expenses saved up. 

We currently have a rental property with $76,000 left on the mortgage with a 3.25% interest rate.  There is 10 years left on the 15 year mortgage.  The property has enough cash flow to cover mortgage/repairs.

We also own our primary residence.  There is $130,000 left on the mortgage with a 4.5% interest rate.  We have only been paying on this home for a year, so there are 29 years left.

I currently also have $10,000 in a 403(b) through my employer.  They offer really inexpensive Vanguard and Fidelity funds.  However, there is a .3% annual expense fee on the account that caps out at $300 per year.

In my eyes, here are my 3 options:
Option 1-  Use the $17,000/yr to pay off the rental property.   Even though the interest rate is low, we could pay the rental off in 3 years and use the extra $9,000 a year to pay off our primary residence.

Option 2-  Use the $17,000/year to pay off our house.  We could pay off our house in 6.5 years.  Once our house is paid off it would only be a few years until the rental paid itself off.

Option 3-  Use the $17,000/yr to max out my 403(b).  Let the mortgages pay themselves off over time.  I understand that in the long-run I would probably earn more in the stock market than I am paying in interest on the loans.

personalfinance,Choice between pension and 401k - state employee.,"My wife started a new job as a state employee where she can pick between a pension and a 401k. Regardless of the choice she picks, she contributes 10% and the employer contributes 14%. 10% of the 14% is a match/pension contribution and the other 4% goes into a retiree medical account if she chooses the 401k option or goes to cover her health coverage in retirement if she chooses the pension. Regardless of which choice she makes she does not have the option to pay into social security. I do not think that she will be at this job until she retires, but you never know. Can you guys help us discuss the pros and cons of each plan? I am leaning towards the all 401k option.

personalfinance,Unmarried couple looking to determine best down-payment option given presently unequal funds,"My boyfriend and I are purchasing a home together and trying to determine the most optimal down payment.  We want to contribute equally, but with the recent sale of my condo I’ve now got a larger chunk of change at my disposal.  Originally I had planned to put these proceeds toward the down payment, in addition to some money from my savings.  We have discussed the possibility of me putting down about $30k more than him, where he would then pay a larger portion of the mortgage over ~4 years until the difference is accounted for.  

But he doesn’t feel comfortable being “indebted” to me, it would be tough for him to save when paying that much each month, and obviously fronting the $30k would be akin to me handing out an interest-free loan (I’m not entirely keen on that).  Then again, doing so would benefit us jointly as our payments would be lower and we’d be able to reduce the money spent on PMI.  We won’t be able to avoid PMI altogether as the max we could theoretically put down is about 18%.  Also to note: we both have excellent credit and were able to secure a low interest rate which would remain the same no matter how much we put down.  

Option 1: If we were to contribute the same amount, we’d be putting down just over 11%.  I could invest the amount I had originally intended to use as a down payment (though I’m not well versed in investing, presently).   When feasible for the both of us, we could each pay an additional, equal amount toward the principle, every few months or so.  (Is there ever a penalty for this?) Hopefully this would more quickly reduce the PMI costs, since PMI ends once we’ve reached 22% in equity.

Option 2: I offer him a personal loan outside of the scope of the mortgage.  This way we both “put down” the same amount, make the same mortgage payments, etc.  The loan would be at a low interest rate, just to account for the fact that I’m not making any gains on this money by investing (and to avoid a gift tax).  My dad suggested this idea and while we’re both open to any possibility, we each think it might complicate things.  Especially since we’re likely to get married within the next 4 years or so.  Additionally, this option is very similar to him paying a higher mortgage portion, though perhaps a bit cleaner on paper. 

Option 3: Your call, reddit.

So my question is basically this:

If we opt to put down 11% instead of a possible 18%, would we be making a stupid decision by choosing to eat the PMI when additional funds are available? Or would it be the best option given our current situation?

I’m inclined to put down the 11% and make increased principle payments when we can.  It will be easier to save by living together (his city rent is absurd and my condo mortgage and HOA fees were just as ridiculous).  I just want to make sure I’m not underestimating the impact of a smaller down payment.  Thanks in advance.",finance,1404919632
worldpolitics,Why are over 99% of Americans and 99% of American Businesses Determined to Cut Their Own Economic Throats?,"See the following link for economic charts and graphics http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/07/why-are-over-99-of-americans-and-99-of.html 

It has been well documented that the middle class in America is being subjected to a continual and pervasive decline due to the current policies of the Federal government and Federal Reserve.

This steep decline in the wealth and prosperity of the middle class means that everybody, except a few thousand people out of 317 million are worse off, from the rich to the poor.

The poor because there are fewer jobs available and less opportunity for advancement because the middle class is not spending as much as it otherwise would.

The rich because the business profits made in the American market will also eventually sharply decline.

The profits of large US Corporations will also decline.

A very significant proportion of profits of large American Corporations are made in foreign markets, particularly in Europe. But the fortunes of Europe are in decline due to the similarly insane policies of it's governments and Central Banks.

Everywhere outside of America is also suffering because the world's largest import market  - America, is in continuous and pervasive decline.

We have a vicious circle preventing job creation, economic growth, wealth and prosperity throughout 99% of the globe.

The few thousand people (perhaps 30,000 in total out of an American population of 317 million or 0.01%) that are benefiting from current policies are those that are directly receiving the benefit of the government and Federal Reserve handouts.

These are :

The CEO's, board members and major owners of crony Corporations that are receiving the benefits of the over $1tn of annual Corporate Welfare, excess military spending and other extreme forms of government waste.

The CEO's board members and major owners of the big banks and Wall Street speculators that are receiving the benefits of the over $1tn a year of subsidies and QE printing by the government and the Federal Reserve.

http://ian56.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-780bn-of-annual-subsidies-to-big.html

So why did 120 million people vote to keep the status quo, ensure their own impoverishment and cut their own economic throats?

Why did those 120 million people vote to return the same crooks that are ruining America, back to DC?

Why did 90 million people not vote at all - why didn't they vote for a non Dem/GOP candidate?

Why are there not 1 million strong protest marches in Washington DC and major cities every weekend?

The coming economic collapse certainly warrants such a protest against the magnitude of the insanity that is the current policies of the Federal government and Federal Reserve.

The economy will NEVER recover unless the disposable incomes of ordinary people start rising again and they won't do that unless the bums are kicked out of office and people who will completely reverse current policy start running the country.

The Evidence

In just about every area one cares to look, the symptoms of the disastrous policies of the Federal government and Federal Reserve in the decline of the middle class are clearly apparent.

In the lack of job creation over the last 14 years, particularly well paid jobs.

Job creation is nowhere near enough to keep up with population growth.

In fact NONE of the jobs created since 2000 have gone to employ the millions of additional Americans of working age there have been. They are all accounted for by the rise in immigrant numbers.

There are now 20 million more people aged between 16 and 65 without a job than there were in 2000. This is the REAL unemployment situation.

In the decline of median incomes - real male median wages are now back to the levels of 1970.

In the real rate of unemployment which is currently extremely high and far above historical norms.

U6 unemployment is now 12%.

The REAL unemployment rate is now 24% and still rising. (U6 unemployment only includes discouraged workers that have actively looked for a job in the last year. Millions of people have given up looking for a job, because of the dire employment situation that exists today.)

In the increase in the number of people aged 55+ that are working because they can no longer afford to retire early and the increase in the number of people over 65 that cannot afford to retire at all.

Almost all of the jobs created since mid 2009 (just over 4 million) are accounted for by the increase in employment of ages 55+, leaving very few jobs available for younger people and a dramatic lowering of advancement opportunities because older experienced people that generally have the better paying more senior jobs are not leaving the work force.

The number of people aged 65+ that are still working has increased by 2 million in the last 5 years.

7 million over 64's now work out of a total of 42.7 million people. http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNU02075379

In the increase in the number of people claiming disability benefits, even though the rate of industrial accidents has sharply declined. The rise in disability numbers is another way for the government to hide the true unemployment rate.

This vicious downward spiral in the American economy is reflected in the recent GDP numbers.

2012 2.8%

2013 1.9%

2014 will be worse - Q1 2014 GDP was MINUS 2.9% and the big banks are already busy downgrading their 2014 forecasts.

2016 will be much, much worse.


This major degradation in the American economy and the middle class is having major impacts in social behavior :-

Bitcoin,Mellon Dynasty Banker: Bitcoin a Solution For a More Transparent Democracy,"What’s the last thing you expect an entrepreneur from one of the most prominent multi billion-dollar banking families in the United States to say? Would it include bitcoin in any form?
Many would suggest the digital currency would be a banker’s worst nightmare, but Matthew Taylor Mellon II — presently the Chairman of the New York Republican Party’s Finance Committee — seems to be quite the fan.
In an interview with Forbes, the highly-successful business man suggested digital currency could be the future of democracy in some respects.
“I feel like citizens are fed up with banksters,” he told the Forbes reporter over lunch. “We need to live in a more transparent, free democracy. The more secretive America becomes, the more dangerous it is.”
The key to this transparent and free democracy, he says, involves bitcoin — which has grown significantly over the past eighteen months.
“The banks are going to be scratching their heads,” he added.
It’s not difficult to see why Mellon is so infatuated with bitcoin. In fact, he’s said to have invested $2 million in an incubator that allows bitcoin-related companies to start up and flourish. That incubator is called CoinApex.
“Matthew is the kind of guy who’s very smart about attracting very talented people to help him figure it out,” said J. Todd Morley, a friend of Mellon’s and founder of Guggenheim Partners. “I know he’s been studying Bitcoin and talking to senior people in the industry.”
It’s certainly an interesting story, and one that is becoming increasingly common as those in the banking industry recognize the promise of this digital currency.
Moreover, there’s no shortage of interesting developments that are taking place with regard to start-ups in the space, which acts as an attractive opportunity for the wealthy investor.
You may very well hear a lot more of this type of optimism in the coming months.

economy,what the deal with excess reserves?,"I was thinking about it, but I am not sure if my reasoning is correct...

Heres a scenario..

-The fed creates deposits through crediting an account
-Bank A then loans out too much
-The loans get redeposited into Bank &gt; into the banks fed account
-Bank A is then short reserves
-Bank A borrows from Bank B to get to the required amount

The excess reserves in the entire system have never changed in their total amount. So then, the only thing that can really affect the excess reserves in the entire system is the amount of banknotes in relation to the money supply because banknotes in circulation have been debited from the fed reserve deposits at some point in time. 

Is this all correct?",finance,1404947811

personalfinance,The university where I received my bachelor's degree will not send a transcript to my place of employment until I repay a loan. Suggestions please.,"I received my BA from a small private school in the midwest in 2011. While attending the university I took out several federal and private student loans, as well as a loan from the university itself (about $8,000), to help pay for tuition. Upon graduating, I received my diploma and attended grad school at a different university. I chose to defer my loan repayment until I graduated from grad school, and applied for deferment from the lending institutions. 

Since graduating with my master's degree, I have begun working somewhere that a bachelor's degree is required. I have contacted the university where I received my bachelor's degree and requested a transcript be sent, but that request has been denied. The loan that I had received from that university while in attendance did not get approved for deferment, and has since been sent to collections. The university claims that they have tried contacting me about the debt, but I never received and form of communication from them about the loan. Now that the debt has gone to collections, they university will not send my transcript to my place of employment.

I realize that I should have paid closer attention when applying for deferment to make sure that every institution accepted my request, but somehow I missed this one. Now I'm at a loss for what to do, I can't afford to pay the collections agency the $8,000+ and may not be able to keep my job if I don't get a transcript sent to HR. 

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1404952958

personalfinance,After being injured I have just under 20k in debt left but a stable job. Which of these is the best way to pay it down?,"Hey there, and a preemptive thanks for any help or experience anyone is willing to share. I do appreciate your time. Also, I am sorry for the throwaway account, but there is some personal information in this post and my main account could, in theory, be traced back to me and I rather that not happen.

Okay, so here is where I am at.
I was young and stupid and, when going through college, I took out more loans than I needed to instead of working. Eventually I got a job but not before getting about 20k in student loan debt. A few years in I was a victim of an accident related to a building collapse and suffered severe neurological injuries that forced me out of school and my job.

It is a few years later and the majority of my neurological problems are resolved but the lawsuit went south and ended with them paying my several hundred thousand in medical bills and practically everything else went to my lawyers. (In fact my lawyers took around $75,000 less than they were legally entitled to just so I would be able to pay off my bills. They were really awesome.) The company responsible, which I won't name, spent an estimated few hundred thousand in legal expenses more than I actually ended up getting awarded. There's some proof for you that the universe has a sense of humor.

The medical bills went unpaid for the duration with most of the providers being unwilling to accept a lien on the case and ended with near hourly collections calls and destroying my credit as they hounded me for money I simply didn't have. With the help of the people who worked at the law firm I have 95% of that expunged from my credit report. My Student loans were in default for a long period of time but I was able to consolidate them into a new federal loan. I just paid off the last $1,500 of my residual medical bills that were not paid for by the lawsuit and I find myself now with around $20k in student loan debt at a 5.88% interest rate.

I have a stable job that won't be going away anytime soon (barring some unforeseen tragedy which I know first hand can happen) and pull in around $1,000 a month more than all my expenses including food, utilities, rent, gas, and other expenses like netflix, dating, eating out, etc.

I have an emergency fund that is around 6 months of expenses that I don't spend that just sits around in an account. I could use a good chunk of this to pay down some of the principal on my loan, thus cutting how much I actually pay on the loan, but I'm not sure if it is wise.

Basically, here are the choices I am looking at, and I would like to stress that I am more than open to any suggestions on how I could do this better. I'm new at this.

The minimum payment is around 160/mo. I could add on an amount monthly to pay a total of $500/mo or I could add more an pay $750/mo. (These amounts are arbitrary. I made them up so they can be shifted).

If I were to pay 5k upfront I could do the same various payments, but it would take longer to rebuild my emergency fund.

So that leaves me with the following:


**Without 5k upfront:**

Payment: ~$160/mo (Minimum)

Final Payment date: September-2030, ~16 years

Total Paid on loan: $30,362.24

Total Interest Paid: $10,757.89



Payment: $500/mo

Final Payment Date: March-2018, ~4 years

Total Paid on loan: 21,823.47

Total Interest Paid: $2,219.12




Payment: $750/Mo

Final Payment Date: November-2016, ~2.5 years

Total paid on loan: $21,029.79

Total Interest Paid: $1,425.44



**With 5k Upfront**

Payment: $500/mo

Final Payment Date: March-2017, ~3 Years

Total Paid on Loan: $20,798.69

Total Interest Paid: $1,194.34

Time to rebuild Emergency fund: ~10 months



Payment: $750/mo

Final Payment Date: April-2016, ~1.5 years

Total Paid on Loan: $20,384.99

Total Interest Paid: $780.64

Time to rebuild Emergency fund: ~24 months months


All this assumes that I receive no raises whatsoever during that time or have additional expenses to offset any raises in income I may get. So paying $5,000 out of my emergency fund plus the larger, $750/mo. payments will get me out of debt in a little over a year and a half and having paid around $10,000 less than making minimum payments for the next 16 years. Is this wise or would I be stretching my budget too thin when $10,000 over 16 years really is not that much, especially counting inflation.

As a sidenote, my car isn't the most reliable and I may need to get a new one in the next year or so. Should I save my emergency fund for that?

Thanks bunches for any input!

personalfinance,This subreddit concerns me. I've seen some very questionable advice and it scares me.,"I remember reading yesterday or a few days back a question regarding a mortgage loan. Essentially, the idea on the front page was that floating rate loan (means your interest payments are fixed to LIBOR rates or something else + agreed upon percentage) was a great idea for some user (despite people not knowing their age, the principle, time horizon, goals, etc). I'm not here to argue that post (though it may not have been appropriate advice given what is likely to happen with the FED discontinuing asset purchases in Oct). But what really concerns me is the providing of ""financial advice"" that is coming from probably a lot of people that have no financial background. 

For an analogy, I think many on Reddit would agree that we do not ask random people for advice regarding our health. In this light, I do not think it is appropriate for people to go on here to provide advice regarding wealth without a type of verification (such as what we see in the science subreddits). 

I really would like a push for the subreddit to ""verify"" the credibility of who is giving advice. Something like if you hold at least a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) or CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation. Or some other way of ensuring that you work in the field.

I really believe that Reddit offers an opportunity to offer advice to people financially without any direct compensation. The best advisors work with the wealthiest people, considering that, this can offer a platform where it is possible to help all economic classes of people with out a monetary incentive. With that in mind, I would hope the people giving their advice know what they are talking about. 

I have been on this subreddit plenty and I can assure that many do not (though some give phenomenal advice and major thanks to you for helping people and making the industry better).

Or nvm, have some asshole tell you to invest in some vangaurd or fidelity fund just because they think its a good idea.  (Not meant to be a slight at those firms. They offer some great products, but its about which one you pick given your specific goals and unique situation).

We need to have proper advice and it needs to be done in the right way, otherwise I am truly scared that the subreddit has more potential to hurt people rather than hurt them.

My parents were horrible with money so I never really received any guidance from them about investing/saving money and I've never had anyone to go to for advice.  I guess I'm just looking for some advice about my current situation and wondering if I'm doing things right.

About me:
27 yrs. old, current salary of $50k plus company car and gas card. 

-$64k of student loan debt: $23k private 5.4% int. $41k Federal 5.8% int.

-$2500 in CC debt currently at 0% for a year (Balance transfer deal)

-$4,000 in savings account

-I started a Roth IRA when I was 17 and put in $50 a month throughout college.  Upped it to $100 recently.  I now have about $7000 in that. 

-$4000 in company 401k.  Company matches 5% but I just recently did my research and changed my contribution from 0 to 5% (idiot move as I've been with the company for 5 years.)

I currently rent but I'm at the age where I want to purchase a home but I want to be completely debt free before I do.  I was foolish and made the minimum payments on student loans for years but I'm committed to paying these things off asap.

Would it be smart to take money from my savings and wipe out the CC debt all at once and then start attacking the student loans while slowly building my emergency fund back up?  

Is it dumb to only be contributing $100 a month to my Roth?

personalfinance,Should I buy the new car or pay to get out of the contract?,"Backstory: I am in the military serving overseas. I entered into a contract with a company here on base called AAFES New Car Sales to buy a new car and have it waiting for me upon return to the states. The problem is, I've changed my mind. I can't actually afford a new car in the long run. I've got a wife and two kids, we are not rich. When my wife and I sat down and talked about our long-term goals and our budget when we get back to the states (pay cut), we realized we need to be as frugal as possible.

Buying a new car seemed, at the time, like a good idea. I signed a ""Buyer's agreement"" and I only skimmed the contract. When I got to the part about cancellation, I asked the salesman about it, and he said it only applied to Harley Davidson buyers and I would get my deposit back if I cancelled within a certain time frame. He told me that this ""Buyer's agreement"" was simply so that he could put me in their system with the $300 (and wouldn't even show me any cars or give financing quotes without it). I didn't investigate further (yeah, I know) and I paid a deposit of $300.

Now he is telling me that I have to pay an additional $800 to cancel. (I can give more info about this if you ask). The car hasn't even shipped yet so the man lied to me about being able to cancel. I never would have signed the contract had I known this. My options are:

1. Buy a new car for $24,000. Pay an additional $300 deposit that supposedly will go toward my loan (another ridiculous fee with another ridiculous story that I can tell you if you're interested). The car itself actually a good deal because of military rebates and such. 5% interest rate over 5 years. The same salesman estimated my payments at $385/month, but an online calculator is now telling me that it should be much higher. 

2. Pay the $800 and wait until we are back in the states to buy a used car for ~15,000. Assuming 5% interest, a 4 year loan, and $14K after $1K down, a payment of ~$325.

I can't see past my anger at myself for not reading the contract in detail and the salesman for lying to my face. Please help me decide what is the rational thing to do: sticking with the new car, or cancelling the whole thing. I don't want to just flush $800 down the toilet and have nothing to show for it, but that might just be my emotional reaction to the situation. What would you do?",finance,1404979212

I probably won't see this money for some time while we're still working through the legalities of it but I want to plan ahead now and explore my options.


Currently what I'm thinking is to immediately pay off my credit card debt ($3,000) and my private loans ($30,000). Both are at much higher interest rates than my federal student loans. Would it be better to just pay off at least the majority of my federal loans too? Since I have the ability and they're accruing ~2-5% interest and a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow with inflation. 

Lastly, I'm looking to invest the vast majority of what I have left after my debts are paid. I can easily manage to live off my current earnings without the burden of monthly debt bills. I'm not looking to keep it in a savings account that barely matches inflation. I've researched many companies and industries over the years because I've always been intrigued by the stock market.

Bitcoin,What is the current inflation rate of Bitcoin? Answer: 15.46% p.a.,"The number of Bitcoins ever mined just hit 13 million.

However, some of these Bitcoins have been lost or are otherwise no longer 'accessible'.

One of the moderators here, jratcliff63367, published this finding here a few months ago:

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AMCS5YbmfRo/UsRVcpL5XZI/AAAAAAAATBM/uLzWXoVh44c/s1600/zombies.png

As you can see, about 4.5 million Bitcoins have not been moved since 2012, when the price was at typically ~$10 or less.

Subtract 4.5 million from 13 million and you're left with 8.5 million Bitcoins actually in circulation.

Now the current block reward is 25BTC, and that won't change until the end of 2016.

These blocks are produced every 10 minutes, and so every 10 minutes the number of Bitcoins in circulation is inflated by 25BTC.

Now,

25BTC x 6 x 24 hours x 365 days = 1,314,000 BTC per year.

So what's the current inflation rate of Bitcoin?

(1,314,000 divided by 8,500,000) x 100 = 15.46% p.a.

**This is comparable to the interest rate on credit card debt**, or an overdraft.

personalfinance,Would I be unwise in paying off the mortgage of my rental property as quickly as possible?,"I've been investing in a mutual fund with USAA that gets these advertised returns http://i.imgur.com/77S6cUa.png.  Not much, like $50/mo.  I have about $400/mo that I could either put into the mortgage or invest somewhere like an IRA or mutual fund...or both.

My mortgage interest rate is 4.375% for 30 years, with about 29 years and $96k to go.  

I just assumed to pay off the mortgage first, before investing anything, so that I can be debt-free once again and have a nice monthly rental income stream.  It'd take about 10 or 11 years, but that's not bad. 

Would I *actually* be better off considering the debt as ""good debt"" and investing extra income in a relatively safe account?  The rate of return on the investment accounts seem better than 4.375%

Not going by any real math, but say the return on the mutual fund ends up to be 5%.  Would the difference in returns be 0.625%?  Like, it's 0.625% financially better to invest rather than pay off the mortgage?  That doesn't seem worth it, if I'm sacrificing the security of zero debt.

I know that numbers never lie, but I have a hard time getting over...or understanding...""good debt"".

I'm sort of leaning towards doing *both* as a bit of extra diversification.  I would get the guaranteed return on my payments through the mortgage, and the riskier investing might give me some better returns.  $200/mo would still cut time spent on the mortgage in half (about).

Bitcoin,Does the Euro adoption have any insights on how to distribute currency to achieve mass-adoption?,"[The ebb and flow between skepticism and embrace doesn’t stop until it is mainstreamed.](http://dailyreckoning.com/witness-the-birth-of-a-new-and-better-currency/) So what should we be doing to ensure mass-adoption?

The consequences of the Euro aligns some with what Bitcoin could accomplish.

[The euro will have important consequences at many different levels.

First, we should not forget that the idea of introducing a single currency was originally motivated by the overall political arguments that an increased integration of the European countries would reduce the risk of war and crises on the continent. Through the establishment of common institutions, political conflicts could be avoided or, at least, resolved through discussion and compromise, rather than by resorting to force. Hence, at a general level, the introduction of a single currency in the euro area is an important symbol for political and social integration in Europe which should serve as a catalyst for further co-ordination and integration also in other policy areas.

Second, on a macroeconomic level, a single monetary policy in the euro area which is firmly geared towards price stability will enhance political and economic stability, not only in the euro area, but also in a global context.

Third, on a microeconomic level, the use of the same currency in the euro area will increase cross-border competition and market integration, thereby improving the efficiency of the markets for goods, services and capital in the participating countries. This should lead to reduced transactions costs, improved price transparency and lower price pressures.](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/1999/html/sp990521.en.html)",cryptocurrency,1405006877
personalfinance,"$44,000 in CC Debt across 2 cards with high revolving min monthly payment. Need to transfer balance to one card with low monthly min to max home loan qualification amount","Hello,

I have been a lurker on this forum for quite some time, but have never posted anything until now.  I know there's some good advice given at times, so I thought i'd give a go at it myself.

My situation:  

I have qualified for $502k FHA home loan from my certified mortgage planner.  To my knowledge the main factors contributing to my qualifying amount are my provable income (avg between 2012-2013 fed tax returns - $114k), my debt ($44k CC debt - $35k amex @ 15.24%, $9k b of a visa @ 9.24% &amp;amp;amp; $32k auto loan @ 0%), and my credit score approx 715. 

For my area, $502k doesn't get you much unless you are willing to commute 1hr + and live in the outlying suburbs.  In an effort to raise my qualifying amount, my mortgage planner suggested i try to lower my minimum CC amount due on paper (amex's min monthly due apparently is a lot higher than traditional visa or mc cc's) by transferring both CC balances to one card.

I know there's a sea of cards to swim through to find one that works right for you.  But is there any that you know of that are ideal for this situation?  Im looking for a transfer CC that will accept $44k, give me some kind of introductory rate (like 0% interest for 18mo + no balance transfer fee).  Is there another avenue that i might explore? like a lower interest personal loan?

many thanks for taking the time to read through this.  If there's any additional information you think i left out, then please let me know and I will add it.

Edit: expecting to file 2014 fed tax return w $145k in earnings w 3 dependents.

Edit: reason I am looking to buy vs. rent a diff (larger) place is that in my 4years at my current apt, rents (on avg) have increased 30-40%.  The $2300 i pay for my current 850 sq ft 2bd/1ba would rent now for $3000-$3200/m in a heartbeat (if not more).  It seems to make more sense to buy a place w/ a $3200/m mortgage a little further out of the area knowing that I'm investing in the family's future rather than re-rent a larger apt half the distance between my current place, and where I would look to buy for the close to the same monthly price.

It's something I'm not sure I understand entirely, a 30yr bond may return over 3% (is that annually? no website says, I assume it is otherwise it would be a real joke). The best part is that it returns the earned interest to you every six months.

personalfinance,I am making progress paying off significant debt.,"Previous post: http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1bedzn/my_salary_is_about_to_increase_significantly_but/

Hello friends!

It's been about a year and a quarter since I asked for your group wisdom and I wanted to provide a bit of an update in case there is further advice I could benefit from in terms of how I allocate my income. I have a long way to go, but it's encouraging to see that real progress has been made.

1) By making a few extra, large payments, I have fully paid off my car. That happened 1-2 months ago and frees up nearly $500/month that previously went to payments.

2) By using part of my bonus and making large loan payments, my student debt has gone from 182k to 156k. I also recently refinanced, improving my interest rates from between 6.5 and 8.5 to a flat 5.8 across the board.

3) I've also made progress from a savings and investment perspective.

3a) I have a checking account cushion of nearly 10k (previously hovered around 2-3k) and am building an emergency fund. The emergency fund is almost halfway to my goal of 21k with ~10% of my post tax salary automatically deposited every month.

3b) I put 7k into an IRA between last year and this year. And last month was the first month where I was eligible for my employer's 401k, to which I contributed heartily as well.


Since refinancing, I'm on a 10-year payoff plan with minimum payments of around $1,800. I'm currently making payments of around $3,500/month. I'm saving around 10% of my income in cash and putting around 10% into my 401(k). I chose a group of investments for the 401(k) that lean heavily towards stocks given I'm around 30 years old.


Are there any adjustments I should make to my approach of paying off student loans and preparing for retirement? Thanks in advance.",finance,1405012389

personalfinance,A little advice for a college student (serious),"So the deal is pretty simple. I am a dummy, didn't do my due diligence in school, and I am now taking an extra year to graduate! I have recently decided to, due to the fact that I had to take an extra year of school, to take out private student loans for this last year. The only reason I am not using my federal loans is because they are maxed out. My parents had zero money to help with school when I graduated high school, with no savings to speak of. I was forced to take out student loans through my institution to pay for our mandatory on-campus housing and meal plan for the first year, and then since then I have used student loans to pay for tuition/additional housing costs along with a part time job. 

This is why I have come to you fantastic people of reddit: 
1) I am planning to take out a student loan in the area of $15000 - $18000 for this next school year. 
2) Yes I have a co-signer.
3) I only plan to take out so much money (I am instate) because I have chosen to focus SOLELY on academics this next year with the goal to graduate May 2015! (I can do it, I have faith) 
4) I plan to live very frugally, and budget. 

Now my question: After paying tuition, and my first month or two of costs up front at the beginning, WHAT should I do with the additional money while it waits to be used for school costs month-to-month? I don't want it to just sit in my bank account, that keeps it liquid but doesn't help in any other ways. Should I invest in low risk (as low as possible..) stock? Mutual funds? What is the best thing I can possibly do with $10000-$12000 over a 6 month time span? 

I appreciate all advice! 

P.s.- I know, I'm a dummy who is way too far in debt, but it is a very serious goal of mine to get my degrees. I didn't have anyone around to really help me with finances, and had very few choices.",finance,1405016070
personalfinance,"Long-term investing -- 401k, Roth IRA, mortgage payments, and kid's college","I'm looking to balance my long-term investments across everything in the title. I am of the opinion that taxes are going to be higher in 20-30 years, so I'd like to have closer to a 65/35 split of Roth (IRA and 401k) to ""traditional"" (401k and stocks, etc) retirement funds.

When we first got our mortgage (30 year, bleh), I wanted to initially throw as much as possible to that to knock it down in 13-15 years, but now I'm beginning to question whether that's the right long-term move.  Would my money be better invested in retirement funds, generally speaking, if I have a 4.5% interest rate on the mortgage?

I'm also torn on how much (if any, atm) to invest in a 529 college savings plan for my kid (1.5 years old). I have a bunch of old savings bonds worth around 2500 (after taxes) that I'm thinking about using to start a 529 for my kid, since they'll make much more there (long-term). Aside from that, I think that education is currently *way* overpriced and that bubble will pop by the time my kid goes to college. There's no possible way that it can keep increasing the way that it has been over the past decade. That, along with the push towards online education (which IMO, will push traditional education costs down), and the hope for scholarships, etc, I'm questioning how much money we'll really need for college.  Add to that the fact that, if we focus on our mortgage instead of this, we'll have an ""extra"" $2k/month in ~13 years anyway, and will be able to stash tons of money away in the following few years (and even during college), if needed.  Our home is plenty big (and new), and we won't *need* to upgrade ever again if we don't want to (unforeseen circumstances excluded). I know I shouldn't make assumptions that might jeopardize my kid's future, but I think there are *so many* reasons to refrain from investing in education right now (aside from my savings bonds that are just sitting there).  Please enlighten me and tell me why I'm wrong.

With all that said, here's my current situation.  I'm currently saving ~1800 per month for retirement (with 450 towards Roth 401k), and have around 1500 ""extra"" that I'm trying to decide how to allocate.  Currently, 401k contributions are maxed to the match percentage. I'm thinking about starting two Roth IRAs (one for me, one for wife) and maxing those, then putting the rest in stock index funds.  Or doing some combination of stocks/mortgage/education.  We'll have another ~1500/month in about 3 years, once a loan is paid and daycare is over with, so I'm also contemplating how to allocate those funds (although I have more time for this, I'd like to have a plan roughed-out for when the time comes).

....but in that time I haven't seen any real change for the better. There is continuous talk of ""big money"" and ""big institutions"" getting into Bitcoin, whatever that means. But it hasn't come.

Adoption has stagnated - I havent seen a brick and mortar store offer bitcoin payments, and I live in a very, very, tech-y city. A few C-list online retailers have started accepting it, pretty much as a gimmick. No one important.

And then the biggest issue i see - mobile payment services like Venmo are becoming popular. Mobile payments are the easiest to understand advantage of bitcoin (to your every day person).

And at the end of the day, the dollar works for most people. Let's just drop the anarcho-capitalist spiel for a second. Your average person barely understands the dollar. But it doesn't matter because they can buy beer and cars and houses and hamburgers with it. It does work. It's accepted everywhere. Nobody gives a shit that the fed controls it or whatever.

Honestly, most people probably have a worse opinion of bitcoin since last december. Obviously it has to do with the dramatic drop in exchange rate - but I'm starting to think the only people who will ever be into it are already into it.

I'm a 23M, living in Florida. I moved(was kicked) out when I was 20 and forced to share an apartment with my sister. I barely made it month to month. We had bare necessities and I lived 5 minutes away from work at the time. I now have a $750 CC in collections, $350 in collections from the internet company from being stiffed on her half of the bill for 4 months and was shut off. Before it's brought up, it was a necessity due to both of us being in college and being in online classes and took the slowest speed possible. It was a cheaper alternative than driving almost 20 miles 4x a week to the college.

I have an 18 year old car that absolutely needs to be repaired to stay running. I've had a family friend mechanic look at it and he estimates about $450 to fix it before the parts basically rust off. I've been driving like this and trying to save to fix it for almost 5 months. I haven't eaten out, bought anything I haven't needed and I coupon and get deals wherever I go and only buy the essentials.

Now once I can get this fixed I should be fine for a while but it's a michigan car and as soon as one part is fixed the next always seems to break. The entire car is filled with rust underneath and everywhere under the hood. In my opinion, at this point of the cars life (195k miles) it's toast and I need to look at other options. In 4 years of owning it I've spend $3500 in repairs. 

Now my biggest concern is that I just got a new job that requires me to drive to different store locations as a store vendor in my personal car and is approximately 2 days a week and 25 hours with incredible pay for what I'm used to. Once I work here for a couple months I'll be full time and quit my 1st job and make about $2,200 a month net income.

I lurk this subreddit a lot and have taken some advice from it before. 
I realize in most cases I see, it's that you should keep repairing your crappy car before financing because it's cheaper than a car payment. I have no problem with my car, I don't need something fancy but when the time comes to get rid of it my credit is shot. I have a credit score of 535 which is very poor. I'm really looking for some options. If I have money saved up when I'm ready to get rid of it I don't want to end up in the same situation as before with a $5k car that needs a lot of repairs in the near future but I also don't have a good enough credit score to finance and don't have anybody to cosign. 

Are there options I have while also trying to pay down my debt to help build credit in the process? I don't qualify for a single credit card. The only thing I've really seen is a secured card through my bank and I can't really find anything saying that it can help build your credit.",finance,1405016872

Essentially I am currently a full-time student and completely dedicated to attending a T14 law school in the Fall Semester of 2015. My wife has been the greatest support for me in my academic endeavorer and has taken the burden of our financial responsibilities, while I have studied 40+ hrs a week for the LSAT and additional time in my school work. 

In light of these circumstances, my wife (who also attends college online) and myself have reached the financial pits of disparity and are engulfed in an insurmountable amount of debt, as well as the ever-so-kind credit bureaus report that basically neither of us are worthy of any considerable options for loans/credit cards. To add to this list my wife's parents are not the optimal candidates for co-signing any loans as well, and it is in neither of our best interests to use them as one. 

Through my diligent mindset and not give up on my desire to attend law school nor cower away from any challenge I've decided to try investing in penny stocks. Please excuse me if my terminology is inadequate but I intend to create a stock portfolio based on immediate fractional gains, with the goal to gain at least $500-$1000 in profits from an initial investment of $1,600 within a one to two months time span. My short-long term goal is to gain approximately $7,000-$11,000 in six months or less and once I reach that amount I intend to either invest those profits into starting my own business and/or invest them in a more steady less-risky portfolio. 

Also, I want to note that I have searched for jobs (with no luck), and now that my senior year will begin in only a few weeks, plus I must commit myself to studying for the LSAT, the standard ""get money for college"" route is not a fast enough nor efficient enough method to alleviate ourselves of this massive debt. I ask anyone who would like to provide advice, websites, or literature to help me with this matter of investing wisely and effectively to please do so, but if someone wants inform me  of information I am not willing to oblige nor do such as drop out of school, take time off after graduating and before going to law school, work around my school schedule (already tried), or anything else in this relation (outside of investment strategies) will be respectfully disregarded. 

I have every right to attend law school; I am motivated, a high achiever, intelligent, and passionate about what I want to do for my future....yet everyday I see a wide array of low-life losers who don't work with numerous children, allegedly living on the poverty line driving brand new cars and living off our government and our tax dollar., I am a just an ambitious college student wishing to focus solely on my academic studies yet I must face continuous financial challenges just to survive. My goal is to create a blanket of financial security for myself and my wife while we attend school, and still be able to work toward that goal while maintaing a level of flexibility with my schedule. Investing in the market seems like the most practical solution.

Any help in this regard will be appreciated thank you......",finance,1405028784
personalfinance,(24 y.o.) Looking for more info on municipal bond funds,"Hi guys, so recently I had a couple consultations with a financial planner (no commitments, not planning to use their funds) and while most of what they said I already knew from this sub-reddit and /r/portfolios, the one thing they brought up was that municipal bond funds were tax free at both the state and federal level, which is great for people at higher tax brackets.  I've seen many recommendations for US/International bonds but nothing about municipal bonds, so I'd like to hear your opinions on if they are worth putting into a portfolio.

For my situation specifically, I have 30k of idle funds after emergency savings/IRA contribution to invest and I'm looking at an income of $96,000 this year which puts me in the 28% bracket at the federal level, and I live in California so I have 9.3% state tax.  That would mean a 5% municipal fund gain should result in something equivalent to an 8% taxable gain from what I understand.  I've seen Vanguard has a fund VWITX which I'm considering as the bond portion of my three fund portfolio.

I'd love to hear your thoughts!",finance,1405031086
personalfinance,Looking for options on how to help GF with her ridiculously high student loan interest rates,"I've recently become aware of the specifics of my girlfriend's student loans and, with no loans myself for context, have only now discovered how crazy the interest rates are... 

She has one federal loan around 6% and then a handful of private loans that go from 7% to **11.25%**! That is crazy high compared to the loans I see elsewhere while doing research, and approaching credit card interest rates.

Most of these loans have been bought out by a single servicer since she graduated, but she still has probably 10 years left on paying back these loans.

My question is: what options does she have for refinancing/consolidating/etc to bring down that rate? Anything? The debt is already there, but I would like to help her get it paid off as soon as possible and those interest rates are crazy.",finance,1405031588
personalfinance,Veteran prepering to buy a home. Any advice?,"I've been trying to get all my ducks in a row in order to buy a home early next year (Feb to May 2015) and be as attractive to lenders as possible. I know all the basics about debt-to-income ratio, credit score, income, etc. I live in a very ""hot"" and competitive real-estate market (Portland, OR) and want to get the best offer as possible from a bank. I'm in pretty good shape in most ways: 65k a year income, been with the same employer for 8 years, credit scores are (725, 760, 755), I've been hammering a couple of student loans I have and should have them all paid off by the time I buy (I worry this might actually lower my credit scores if I pay off two of them within a few months of when I talk to a broker because I've read scores will take a dip due to less lines reporting). I really need to pay these suckers off to lower my debt to income ratio however (300 a month). For my down payment I'm going to have to borrow from my retirement, but will have 10% down. Not ideal, but with the market in Portland increasing so quickly and interest rates going to rise, I have little choice. 

My only debt will be one student loan with monthly payment of 380 a month. I use all my four credit cards monthly, but pay them off in the same billing cycle. I have a car loan paid off last year, 100% on time, etc. I have no late payments, ever, but last summer my credit utilization was too high (had a few months where I was over 50%). However, when I go to buy I will have credit utilization under 30% for well over a year. I'm hoping to beat the fed raising the interest rate. I'm also a veteran and am eligible for a VA loan. I'm really only looking to buy something valued at 200k (I'm single, no kids, just a few pets). 

Any advice on what I should be doing in the next year to make myself more attractive or things I should consider would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1405031820

Many games seem very hyped and stay hyped during announcements and trailers and so forth. Then the pre-order dlc comes in, Some people are annoyed by that but seems fine to the most.
Then the D1DLC is announced, The whole internet goes crazy, And not in a good way.
Some would say that the D1DLC is just a way just to exploit many gamers, But i would disagree with that statement. Many games are finished WAY before release and can take up to be marked and certified for release on platforms. People are still coming to office for up to half a year after the game is completed, And i don't mean 24/7 ya smartaleks, So they decide to create extra content they want to release, But the game is already being certifed and sending another copy just with a couple new weapons every two weeks would be a little stressful to say the least on the certifiers. So you know what they do? Release day one dlc. If anything they're delivering more content for the consumer..",technology,1405032997

This is the company's mistake, but I was negligent for letting it go for this long, so I accept the responsibility for it. What do I do now?

personalfinance,What's my best course of action to solve this?,"So I've kind of put myself in a bad position financially, and I'm not 100% sure what my best course of action is. Long story short, I was enrolled for two years in a very prestigious undergraduate engineering program at a private university (mostly funded via private student loans through Chase Bank and a few Federal Student loans) before the ""less consequence aware"" younger version of myself decided that other things were more important than my education and I failed out. Now I'm stuck with a mountain of student debt, some CC debt, and a very low income job due to not finishing my degree. I've basically ignored the problem for the last 4 years (VERY stupid, I know) and defaulted on every source of credit I had. Now that I've made myself aware of the importance of personal finance, I'd like to take the steps necessary to correct the situation, but don't really know what my options are.

Here's some details -

Chase Bank private student loan (I believe this loan was NOT federally guaranteed) ~ $50k

Federal student loans ~ 30k (this includes a loan that my parents cosigned for that I pay on time every month, absolutely didn't want to affect their credit!)

CC debt ~ 7k (across 2 cards, one of them sued me and got a judgment for $1700 last year)

Other debt (old utilities and such) ~1.5k

Current taxable income - ~25k/year

From what I understand, federal student loans can't be discharged ever. No problem, I can handle that amount through strict budgeting and some financial discipline. However, the total amount of debt as compared to my income is staggering. I don't think it's possible to climb out of the hole, despite how much I want to pay back what I borrowed. Is bankruptcy an option to eliminate the private student loans? Would it be worth it to just get rid of the non-student debt and wait the remainder of the statute of limitations for my private student loan (6 years in my state, just over 2 years remaining on it)? At this point, my credit is so trashed that ever owning a home or newer car seems out of the question (and at this point both of those things SHOULD be out of the question until my income is higher) but later down the road if I'm earning more I would still have to face the ever increasing debt I have piled up now.

A little information about my parents. They are currently both in their late 50s, but I expect them to continue working for quite some time because they both love their jobs. Currently, they have around $200k sitting in cash.

I told them previously that this is a pretty bad idea because of the low interest rates that banks offer, so I'm pretty glad that they are now interested in investing the money.

I told them to save roughly a year's worth of expenses in rainy day funds, but what should they do with the rest of the money? They are on the older end of things so I feel that they should make some safer investments. 

Should I try to steer them towards mutual funds? Do they need a fund manager? If so, how do we make sure that the manager doesn't rip them off and works in their best interest?

Alright PF, looking for some feedback or advice or even reassurance. Spent the last day or two really sitting down and tracking where my fiance and I stand and it's a bit overwhelming right now. Here's the short(ish) version:

- Both newer grads (him with bachelor's, myself with master's), with my loans in repayment and his in grace until November. 
- At least for the moment, I make approx 3x what he does. He is actively hunting for a job in his field (math/statistics).
- C (myself) = 27 years old, R (him) = 31
- Ready or not, wedding is coming next March (as in everything is signed and booked). Family is being extremely helpful but there will be costs we have yet to iron out.
- We completely lack a grocery/eating out budget. We just haven't paid attention to it and we know this is the most basic place we need to start. It's not terribly high as we've never felt strained for money but it does need to be tracked. 

Because I finished school before he did, I've been functioning by myself and just throwing as much money as I can at my loans. The good news is I'm on track to finish them by September. But now that his loans are coming into play, the wedding is 9 months away, I have yet to contribute to my IRA this year AND I will have 401k eligibility in December (I'm assuming that means I won't actually contribute until first quarter 2015), I want to make sure we have our priorities in order. 

I'm assuming that the best way to go about this is: Finish my remaining federal loans (family loans have no due date at this time), have both of us start paying down his loans from highest interest to lowest, set aside enough to finish my IRA this year, then focus on wedding costs, then worry about 401k after the wedding.

Seeing the total debt is alarming, but it's not as if that debt is due to be paid off tomorrow. My payoff date was 2024 which is... clearly not going to happen. But where do we focus? What would you do in our situation? 

Perhaps more importantly - as a 31 year old he's later in the game to starting his retirement fund (not that my situation is much better). How can we catch up so that we can feel more comfortable settling down with a kid in 5 years? Home ownership in the west within 10 years?",finance,1405052363
Banking,What are the key differences between a Term Deposit and a Certificate of Deposit? What is Discounted Certificate of Deposit?,"I'm opening another account in a bank outside of the United States and they offer Term Deposits with rates for residents and non-residents which are lower than their Certificate of Deposits.  Here are some of the differences I have observed reading on my own:

Term Deposit:

* Minimum amount $500 USD (or equivalent currency)
* Can be opened and renewed online

Certificate of Deposit:

* Minimum amount $5,000 USD ( or equivalent currency)
* Can only be opened and renewed in person at a bank branch
* Can receive a loan against the CD
* Can sell or transfer the CD to another person

They also offer a Discount Certificate of Deposit which offers the highest interest rate at 9.75% and otherwise appears to be similar to a standard CD.

Here are some questions I have:
From a bank perspective, why do they offer these 3 different products?

Is my money equally safe in a Term Deposit as it is in a CD or are their typically different levels of security with regards to insurance and payouts due to bank insolvency (sort of like preferred stock or bonds compared to common stock)?

Why would a bank allow a Term Deposit - of any amount - to be opened online, but CDs must be opened in person?  Does it have something to do with the nature of the latter's transferability?

Why shouldn't I just go for the Discount CD for maximum returns?",finance,1405054085
personalfinance,How many cards is too many?,"A little background:

About two years I graduated college and had no credit in my name whatsoever. I got a job across the country and 1) needed to start building credit 2) needed a credit card for certain purchases to get myself set up until the pay checks rolled in.

I was denied for multiple cards for what I thought was identity theft but it turned out I had absolutely zero credit and was not on anyone's radar. After a bit more searching I was able to get a secured credit card with a $1000 limit (my own money locked up in a savings account). I used that for approximately one year when I decided to get a Chase United card to earn some extra perks when I traveled for work. I also got a Nordstrom card with a low limit to buy clothes for work and get a few perks. Maybe six months later I applied for a Starwood AMEX because I started traveling again. After two years I've gone from having no credit or credit cards to having a credit score that's been fluctuating between 700 and 760 (bank offers credit grades) and four credit cards.

I believe that is a good rating for someone my age with minimal history (correct me if I'm wrong). I also pay my balances in full every month and have only made one late payment.

My question for you is this: how many cards is too many? I'm switching airlines because I'm fed up with United and want to apply for another card so I can take advantage of the perks it provides. That would be five cards in 24 months and I feel like that's high. I believe they do hard pulls when you apply for a card and that can have a negative effect on your score but does the number of lines of credit matter? Even if they're in good standing?",finance,1405059600
personalfinance,Student loan repayment plan? A mistake?,"Somehow, for the past few years, I have been on an ""extended level"" repayment plan even though I had less than the $30,000 required (only had $27,000 when I graduated). I am a little worried about it since I am not sure how it happened (unless I picked that when I initially took the loans out from Dept. of Ed and it never got changed). Should I let them know? Could they sue me or suddenly demand a lot of money from me for being on the wrong plan? This could be caused by me making advanced payments (most of my loans are paid up for several months).


Additionally, on a slightly related subject, I am in the process of saving to go to a foreign graduate school. As such, even though I know I am paying basically only interest, I want to only pay the minimum for the next year as I will be losing my job next year and need to save as much as possible over the next 12 months. I calculate that at least $2000 is going to have to go to my student loans to keep from defaulting. Am I making a mistake to do this? If I dumped my savings account out now, I could dramatically reduce my loans and the interest I pay, but then I wouldn't have any safety net, no chances of graduate school, or even money to move on.


Just to vent... I really hate myself for being so financially stupid over the past few years. I have a decent income, but I didn't understand loans and interest rates and basically have been blowing thousands every year just paying my interest down and not tackling the principle. I am very angry and disappointed.",finance,1405060290

It was a long time between drinks for people who play cricket games, and quite frankly, it's amazing. However, it seems that the creators have been having issues with the number of people pirating the game, particularly in India. Today they posted the following figures on the Planet Cricket forums:

Countries by percent of Steam sales:
Australia 30.6%
United Kingdom 28.3%
India 9.7%
South Africa 7.0%
United States 6.5%
New Zealand 4.9%
Russian Federation 3.5%
Canada 2.3%
United Arab Emirates 0.9%
Germany 0.7%
other 5.6%

""Users"" (Legal users and Pirates) by percent online:
India 89.67%
Australia 3.50%
United Kingdom 3.23%
South Africa 0.80%
United States 0.75%
New Zealand 0.57%
Russian Federation 0.40%
Canada 0.26%
United Arab Emirates 0.10%
Germany 0.08%
other 0.64%

That is, the shear number of pirate users in India dwarfs the legal sales worldwide. For a niche game this is a devastating blow for them, and something that looks likely to end any future PC versions of this game. My experience with steam has been that they diminish the issues of piracy, but these kinds of numbers (and numerous pirates directly asking for help with the pirated games on Planet Cricket, where the CEO of the company that made the game regularly interact with the fans of the game) and the low PC sales as compared to the console version (released 2 months prior) may well end any hope of their future games being released on PC. 

My understanding is that generally pirates wouldn't have bought a game in any case, and that the fact the PC version was released 2 months after console versions would have cannibalized the sales of a PC version. But those from the company that made the game seem convinced that this is a major, uncontrollable issue (though are doing their best to update the game and in the course of two weeks have released something like 8 minor patches). 

So yeah, basically, what are people's opinions of piracy in such an issue, and do you think it would really be worth them canning future PC versions of Don Bradman Cricket due to such rampant piracy.",technology,1405070870

personalfinance,Buying parents a house to save tax-excluded income.,"My husband and I(30f and 29m) work overseas. We have very little debt, and what we do have (fed. student loans) is currently being repaid through PSLF, so is not a consideration. We do not make a killing, but as teachers we generally save ~45,000 per year. The problem is that this money is excluded from our taxes under FEIE, (we both file, obviously). This means that traditional forms of saving for retirement (401ks and IRAs ) are not available to us. The advice of our colleagues in the same situation is usually to buy property, as one can put down a hefty down payment and receive rental income from a tenant, etc. We are not interested in this from a financial and stress perspective.

What we would like to do is put up 1/2 to 3/4 of the full cost of a house for my in-laws, which they would live in (and pay property taxes on) basically rent-free. As far as estate planning would go, the house would then pass to us when they died. This would allow us to have a large amount of equity in a house, not have to worry about landlord/tenant issues, and help our family. We would obviously enshrine this plan in a legal document.

I kinda feel like the employer is trying to deceive me, by paying me a lesser amount and adding allowances to my check. I pay self-employment tax every year and so I set my w-4 up for the quantity of money that I predict I will earn every year.

personalfinance,Need Advice on how to invest extra savings/income. Married with one child and combined $178k pre-tax income.,"I am using my throwaway account for obvious reasons.  

**Background**

As stated in the title, my wife and I are in our early 30s make a combined $178k before taxes and take home a net amount of $9100 per month.  We have a 7 month old child that we send to day care.  We live in the Washington D.C metropolitan area and both work for large IT consulting firms that support the federal government.

**DEBT**

Student Loans - completely paid off

Car 1 - $419 a month (Needed larger Car for new baby) 0.9% interest for 60 months (22k on loan)

Car 2 - Paid Off

Mortgage - $1300/month (House value is about 40k more than what we owe on the loan)


**Notable Expenses**

Daycare - $337 per week

Utilities - $200/month

Cable/Internet - $150/month

Food - $500/month (includes going out to restaurants)

Baby Supplies - $150/month

Gas - $200/month

**Investments**

My 401K - $133k - I contribute the maximum allowed per year

Roth IRA (rolled over from a 401k from previous job that remains untouched) - $18k

Wife's 401K - $50k - she contributes approximately 10% of her salary

Capital One 360 Account (0.75% APR) - $55K

Child's 529 Plan - $1500 (Add $250 per month)

After all expenses and bills each month, we auto-deduct $2000 from our checking and place it directly into our Capital One Savings account.  I would say that our 6 month emergency fund would be around $25k - $30k.  We plan to buy a new home in the next 5 years and also plan to add another child.

personalfinance,Still confused about taxes :/,"Hi all, this is my first year having a real job, I want to make sure I am doing this right. My tax bill seems... really low.

Here's the facts:

I am getting married next month. My fiancée is a student, but she worked a few months this year.

I started mid-year, and my gross income this year will be $81418 (counting sign-on bonus). My fiancée earned $6820.

My company also paid for my relocation and gave me a lump-sum payment for a house hunting trip. According to my paystub, the value of this was $14317. Then I received tax assistance in the form of $8681, which seems awfully high.

I also have $371 deducted per paycheck before tax for medical, vision, dental, 401k, and my HSA.

So I sat down and did a calculation like this:

Gross income = 81418 (my income) + 6820 (her income) + 8681 (tax assistance) + 14317 (relocation) = $111236

Taxable income = 111236 (gross income) - 371 * 20 (pre-tax deductions for this year) = $103816

So now I am figuring out deductions and exemptions. As far as I can tell, for our taxes we can claim the standard deduction of $12,400 and 2 personal exemptions totaling $7,900. Line B of the W-4 also says you get an exemption if you have a job and your spouse does not. I am not sure if I qualify for that exemption, since she did have a job during 2014.

Assuming that I only have 2 exemptions instead of 3, that means that my remaining taxable income is 103816 - 12400 - 7900 = $83516. According to [this page](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2013/10/31/irs-announces-2014-tax-brackets-standard-deduction-amounts-and-more/), our taxes would be 10162 + .25*(83516 - 73800) = $12,591.

Am I doing my math right? This number seems really low (12.1% effective tax rate)! I've already paid over $12,000 in Fed Withholding this year, does that mean I should ratchet up my deductions? And do I actually qualify for that third exemption? (Our jobs never overlapped.)",finance,1405103534

I've adopted a frugal lifestyle and a tightwad attitude towards using credit for anything. If I can't afford it, I don't need it. I have a $0 balance/$2000 limit credit card (6yrs/good standing), that I only put gas on and pay in full each month. My expenses are cheap now to where I live on only 50% of my income.

One of the things holding me back is my mix of credit, I've only ever had credit cards. I have no need for installment loans, other than an eventual mortgage (hopefully 1-2 years from now) that I really want to shoot for the absolute best interest rate possible.

Would it help my credit look better in like a year or so from now to take out a small personal loan I don't need/wont touch other than to pay it off? I think this move will show more diversity on my credit report and make the payment history look better along with continuing to use the gas card. Is this a dumb strategy? Are there any reasons I shouldn't do this? Any insight would be super appreciated. Thanks!!

personalfinance,Questions about cash balance retirement savings plans vs student loans.,"Hi pf,

My employer offers a cash balance plan that they contribute to and a 403(b) to which I contribute by myself.

For the 1st through 5th years of employment, my employer contributes 5% of my annual salary. Every additional 5 years of service, the percentage goes up by 1. So between the 5th and 10th years, my employer contributes 6%. This goes all the way up to 10%. Vested after 3 years.

Since my employer doesn't contribute to my 403(b), does that mean I should ""match"" the cash balance contribution? Does that make sense in this case? Or, since they'll contribute 5% no matter what I put away for myself, should I just do what's best for me? 

I have 34k in federal student loans varying from 3% to 6.8%. I'm currently ""avalanching"" on my most expensive loan.

In this situation, it wise to reduce my 403(b) contribution for the sake of paying down my debt more aggressively?

personalfinance,Worried about the reasons my credit card company is saying they are raising my interest rate.,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I got a letter today from my credit card issuer (my bank) saying that my APR is increasing by 1% from 9.99% to 10.99%.  I've had the card for several years, and have carried a zero balance for almost a year, and I'm not irked by the increase, but I am concerned about the reasons they listed as why:

Your credit score:  703  (4/8/2014)

Key factors that adversely affected your credit score:

*  Serious delinquency

*  Proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high

*  Too few accounts currently paid as agreed

*  Length of time revolving accounts have been established

In the last year I have paid off in full the following debts on time (automatic withdrawal) and making well above minimum payments:

* $1500 credit card debt - zero balance since about August 2013

* $2800 student loan

* $1200 student loan


I have also been making automatic car payments on time through autowithdrawal for the entire time I've had the loan (bought the car July 2012); the total of the loan is for $18,000 with about $4,000 of that as interest over 6 years.

A few years ago (maybe 5?), I did have a gym membership go to collections because I had cancelled my debit card and never updated them with the new number.  I paid off the debt in full the first time collections called me for a total of around $500.

I missed credit card payments here and there years ago but have not missed a payment in over 2 years at least.

Does anyone know why they would list those keys factors, like Serious Deliquency??  I would be surprised to hear my interest rate was going up for something that was already on my record last year when they lowered it from 10.99 to 9.99.

personalfinance,Fiance didn't finish college - best options for loan repayment? Looking for advice...,"Background: I make ~75k/year (gross).  My fiance struggled with school and has decided to take a break - which may end up being permanent (I wouldn't be surprised - she really struggled with school).  She currently makes $10/hr (~$21k/year gross).  Her federal loans total ~$31k.  She has another private loan that's about 11k.

Our current plan is to pay her loans off as quickly as possible, with most of the payment coming from my income.  However, I've started to wonder if it would make more sense to switch to one of the income driven plans.  I don't know that she'll ever make a whole lot of money.

I'm not worried about the private loan - I know we have to pay that back, but on the federal loans, the monthly minimum is currently about $340.  If we switched her to Pay As You Earn, her monthly payment would be $22.  If we switched her to IBR, it'd be $41.  Would she qualify for either of these?  If so, do you think it makes financial sense to do so?  This would also help us pay off the private loan more quickly.  As financially responsible as I am, it just feels wrong to pay the minimum on a loan - but I'm thinking it's the best route in the long run (save us the most money).

I know when we get married, we'd have to file taxes separately to keep the low rates, but I imagine that's worth it.

gaming,Feedback on a basic game concept,"This is a MMORPG.

Setting: This is set in a time just before electricity, so there are no cars/electronics/lights.

Type: Imagine a map similar to Runescape in terms of city layout - camera angle still not decided (either from above, from behind, or from your eyes).

You create your account and start off in the hospital in the main city. You were in an accident and have no memory of anything prior - you don't know your name, how to do anything (other than walking/talking), or anything like that. The doctor tells you that he needs a name for your chart, so you need to tell him one (this will create your display name), and then he sends you to see a counselor to get help (will be the tutorial), or you can skip it and leave on your own.

The screen goes black from this short exchange, and then you appear outside of the hospital. There are shops all around you, other players, guards, etc. It's a massive vibrant city full of activity, and completely safe. This main city is where almost anything can be done.

Anywhere in the world you're able to attack other players or mug them. However, cities have guards in them, so of course in the main city it is impossible to do that without being arrested (you won't have a chance to kill someone, the guards stop you as you click to attack). On the outskirts of cities and where you walk to get to other cities, you can be attacked and killed, the guard presence is almost non-existent. Every other city has a different amount of guards, and the more guards that there are, the safer you are. If you stay around the guards, they will see you get attacked and the attacker will be arrested. If you happen to die from anything (including being attacked), you appear back in the hospital of whichever city you're closest to and have to pay a small hospital bill and lose some health experience - you keep all of your items. If someone mugs you, you lose only a very small amount of money, the amount depends on the attackers theft level. The entire game is a survival game, with also a grinding feel to it (a very similar idea to Runescape).

If you get arrested*, you just appear in a jail cell and the guards releasing you, and have to pay for bail. If you don't have money then the bank pays for you and you owe the bank next time you deposit money.

Unlike other games, there is no ""magic"". Everything is real, all monsters are real animals that we had at that time. You can attack and kill any monster, and they drop various items. As well as attacking monsters, you can also mount them and they help you get around faster. Mounting is a skill, and you can only mount things you have the level for, and sometimes even if you do have the skill for it, there's a chance they'll attack you as you try to mount them.

This game will be very clan-based, and there will be places to go to set up clans with other users for a fee. If you set up a clan, you can later invite anyone to join the clan.

Quests: They will be in this game as well, though they're more traditional ""do something for me"" kind of quests where they send you out to do a certain task then reward you for it.

Skills: There will be many typical skills such as theft, mounting, health, attack, defense, woodcutting, fishing, crafting, mining, etc.

Bank: Used for anything involved with money. If you keep money in there, you get a slight interest rate on it so it's encouraged.

Storage: There will be a building similar to the bank where you can store any items.

Any thoughts?

Once I got the ball rolling, motivation kicked in and I couldn't wait to update my spreadsheet every month. I maintained a $10,000 emergency fund throughout the whole process, but dug into that fund to pay the final $2000 with the idea of replenishing it next month.
It feels great to have that monkey off my back.

BTW, I make low $100,000s and have 3 kids and a stay-at-home wife.
__________________
Edit: Lots of comments below about how easy it must to pay off that much debt with a 6-figure salary. A couple of points here: We live as frugally as possible - no cable, no land-line, shop at thrift stores and Aldi, we drive a 15 year old corolla and a 10 year old minivan, rarely eat out, take vacations, etc. Sure, I was able to knock down the debt quicker than most, but the same principles of PF still apply - don't live beyond your means, budget, prioritize debt, etc. 

Also, there are questions about whether I would have been better off hanging on to that debt and investing the money instead. Just looking at interest rates vs rates of return, the answer is obvious in hind-sight. However, I really wanted to be debt-free and was willing to sacrifice a bit of future return to make it happen. The added security, plus knowing that my wife and kids wouldn't be saddled with that debt if something were to happen to me, makes the decision to pay it off aggressively worth it in my mind. Now I plan to replenish my emergency fund and contribute heavily to retirement to help make up some of the difference. The amount I was putting to the student loans is getting rolled right into retirement (and getting a bit more aggressive on the mortgage); we'll continue to live our frugal lifestyle. 

Edit 2: For anyone asking for a link to the blank spreadsheet, you can find it here: https://www.sendspace.com/file/x7x53o
Fill in the starting balance at the top of the ""balance sheet"" tab and update the shaded columns every time you make a payment. It will calculate the remaining balance, total paid, and percent of debt remaining. You'll want to tweak it so that the graph only displays the cells with actual data in them.

Edit 3: Just to clarify, I still made 401K contributions up to my employer match (6%). So I was still investing the equivalent of 12% of my annual salary while aggressively paying down these student loans. I didn't walk away from any free money.",finance,1405129508
news,THE SEARING OF A GREAT CITY'S SOUL!,"Friday, July 11th, 2014
New Orleans, Louisiana

THE SEARING OF A GREAT CITY’S SOUL!

The Queen City of the South is under siege.  No, not from hurricanes. This time, the siege is from within.  New Orleans is known as the city that care forgot.  But it’s been hard to let the good times roll in the Big Easy when the dice keep coming up snake eyes.  

New Orleans is in a battle to stay afloat as it deals with major street crime, corrupt politicians, and a dysfunctional criminal justice system where even federal officials can no longer be trusted.  Author James Lee Burke writes about this corruption and dysfunction in his novel Last Car to Elysian Fields.  “One of the most beautiful cities in the Western hemisphere was killed three times, and not just by forces of nature.”

New Orleans is a city that for years has had the highest per capita murder rate in the nation, where multiple killings often happen on a daily basis, a town that is rated as one of the five most dangerous cities in the world.  But even with such a reputation, it was hard to fathom the recent shootings of 10 tourists on Bourbon Street.  And such violence is not a unique event.  Just last year, “Gunfire erupted at a parade to celebrate Mother's Day, injuring 19, including two 10-year-old kids,” according to police. Such violence goes beyond the street shootings that seem to happen almost daily in New Orleans.  When a gunman indiscriminately fires into a crowd, it’s an act of terrorism.

Many crimes go unreported out of the sense of frustration that nobody will do anything about it, anyway. Recently, a young relative of mine was walking uptown from the French Quarter.  Just across Canal, in one of the busier sections of the city, a man steps out of nowhere and without rhyme or reason, punches him in the face. In an instant, my relative had become a victim of the “knockout game,” a brutal ritual where street thugs approach an innocent bystander and try, in one blow, to knock him out. He suffered a concussion and had his jaw wired shut for weeks.  This type of street violence seems to happen all the time.

Another blow to confidence in the city’s leadership hit this week, when the former two term Mayor Ray Nagin was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for taking bribes while in office.  Nagin will be remembered as the mayor who ran off to Dallas with his family when New Orleans was plummeted by Hurricane Katrina.  And when the murder rate continued to clime under his watch, the best observation he could offer was: “Oh well, it keeps the New Orleans brand out there.”

Current New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu has asked for state and federal help, and for good reason.  After Katrina, the governor sent in 300 hundred national guard troops to maintain order. And this time, he needs to send in a lot more.  Recently, the governor of Colorado committed more than 600 guardsmen to help feed cattle whose welfare had been threatened by the blizzards. If you can bring in more guardsmen for cattle, the state should be willing to do it for people.

Some might argue that the presence of soldiers on the streets will dampen tourism.  Not so in my opinion.  After Katrina, I hosted a daily radio program in New Orleans and was out each evening for walks and to meet friends for dinner.  National guardsmen were prominent throughout the downtown area, and we all felt much safer because of their presence.  So turn loose the National Guard Governor, to give a comfort level to the millions of tourists who help drive the state’s economy.

New Orleans can be either a unique place to live and work, or it can slowly drift into the cosmos due to a justified fear of crime.  There’s a fight to keep the bright, dynamic young leadership in the city and be an integral force in molding the future of New Orleans.  But it all begins with feeling safe, doesn’t it?  And right now, the Crescent City still has a long way to go.

I'm working full-time for a non-profit and am eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). I'm trying to decide whether to to take advantage of it or to just try and pay my loans down aggressively.

I love my work and the non-profit is stable. I believe I could sustain 10 years with nonprofits, even if it's not with the same company for the whole 10 years. It's really hard to project that far, and I'm nervous about the risk of not paying down the debt in advance.

**Questions:** 

1. General advice. I have no idea what I'm doing.  
1. How long do I have before I need to report my new income and adopt a revised payment plan? I re-qualified for IBR under my previous minuscule income two months ago.
1. Starting the qualification process involves consolidating my loans. Is there any risk to this?  
1. What are the catches to PSLF? Will I regret this?  
1. Is IBR the best repayment plan under which to make my payments, or should I apply for a different repayment plan? 
1. Am I correct in thinking that PSLF forgiveness does NOT count as taxable income?


I missed out on eligibility for Pay-As-You-Earn by a few months and never saw a single one of those lower interest rate federal loans, so I feel like I ended up in the ""fuck you"" bracket of student loan borrowers.

I know that  if you ultimately do not meet the eligibility requirements for PSLF, you will be responsible for repaying the entire balance of your loan, including all accrued interest, unless you qualify for forgiveness under the terms of another repayment plan. If I only make the minimum payments and plan on the PSLF, I will be ruined if I lose out on the forgiveness due to a technicality. It's scary.

personalfinance,"Need some advice regarding 401(k) contribution, student loans, and credit card debt.","I'm not sure how to phrase this question, but I'll do my best.

Some background:
I'm a 32 year old veteran. I only served 6 years in the military, so I don't have a pension. I've spent the past 7 years earning a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, then 2nd bachelors degree in computer science. Those degrees, even with the GI Bill, have cost me about 57k in Federal student loans.
I don't have any 401(k), but have just started a job that offers 401(k) with an employer match.
I've also got a bit of credit card debt spread across 3 cards, roughly 15k total.

Summary so far:

 * 401(k) = $0
 * Student Loans = ~$57,000 at about 4% ±1%
 * Credit Card debt = ~$15,000 at about 12% APR

Employer matches $0.50 for every $1.00 I contribute to my 401(k), up to the first 6%.

I'm not an accountant, so I've not the slightest idea how to calculate the possibilities here. My question is this: Should I contribute as much now to my 401(k) or should I contribute less (enough to get full employer match), and try to pay down my debts to save on paying on the interest? 

My intuition says that I should pump as much into my 401(k) now in order to maximize earned interest and increase my retirement, but I was told that I should consider how much I'll owe in interest to my credit cards and student loans.

**Edit**
Thanks for the replies everyone. I've done some more math and think I have a plan of action.",finance,1405134236

personalfinance,"70K for college but no other debt, jobless, finance &amp; numbers highly confusing","Long time lurker here. Decided to finally take the plunge and post up.

Here is the short of it:
*70K in Student Loan debt (US DEPT OF ED/STATE HIGHER ED/SALLIE MAE)
*No other debts (credit cards, etc)
*My scores according to creditkarma.com are as follows... 
TransUnion : ""very poor"" + Vantage : ""D"" rating
*Unemployed &amp; have been since I started college
*No financial obligations (my family helps make student loan payments, car insurance, cell-phone bill, etc.)

Before going to college I didn't really know much at all about loans, how much tuition was going to cost, interest rates, or even whether or not I should actually go to college. The debate of whether or not to attend may be more relevant when factoring in that it's a degree in Fine Art.
Regardless, I did get a LOT out of my college experience. Dean's list/honor roll, note-taker, always spending time at school working, and making sure I spent my time wisely. I was part of the small minority of people who actually cared about their work and studies in a professional manner. To note, I've been passionate about being an artist ever since I can remember, while in school I felt like I was ""where I needed to be"" in terms of beginning my career, and functioned very well in an academic environment among/with my colleagues.  
Fast forward to post-graduation. Morally, I could not go the route of the unpaid internship, as some do in fine arts. My stubbornness lead me to reject even getting a job for a while. It's now been about a year since I've graduated. I've had some success with getting into art shows, selling work, and continuing to invest in my art practice. However, I'm at a point now where I feel like I need to bring it to the next level. I need to stop scraping by and make more money to fund my work, preferably *with* my work, and get a bigger studio space because I can't keep working out of an empty room in my apartment.

Alas, a long conversation I had with someone led me to lurking on Reddit. After reading a bunch here and on /r/Entrepreneur, I decided to start looking into my debts. Numbers, business plans, and anything that has to do with finance aside from ""should I buy a whole pizza or paint?"" and saving $50 to buy a roll of canvas become kind of nerve-racking to me. So, while cringing, I finally looked up my credit score and accumulated debt. Those findings are posted above. So now, without much in terms of employment, I'm sort of lost about ways in which I can get out of this imagined hole I've put myself into.

To note, I am a very entrepreneurial-minded person in terms of thinking about ideas but completely novice when it comes to how things work financially, which leads to a lot of brainstorming without any practical application. Conversely, I don't too well selling my own artwork or pulling in new audiences for my work beyond participating in exhibitions. With that, I've come here seeking advice about ideas, tips, and suggestions on how to move forward financially, pay my debts, and stop living ""the bohemian dream.""

Thanks &lt;3",finance,1405143118
personalfinance,Daughter got a 1.5 GPA her freshman year and is ineligible for federal aid this upcoming school year. {REPOSTED from r/studentloans),"Thus, she will be attending Community College for at least the upcoming fall semester. Unfortunately, this will still place a financial burden on our family.

Questions:

1) Are there private student loans that defer payment while the student is enrolled, and by 'enrollment' I mean through the date of her Bachelor's degree graduation? Any recommendations?

2) If she lives at home, we are looking at about $2,500 for a semester of community college including enrollment, tuition, books and fees. As we don't have $2,500 to spare, is it better to get a private loan or place the amount on a credit card?

3) She doesn't want to live at home (she was in the dorms her freshman year, at a college about 30 minutes from our house). Can we get a private student loan that is large enough for living expenses, and is there any peril (besides higher monthly payments) that is different than a lower amount loan for just tuition and books?

4) Please explain the co-sign requirements of these private student loans. My wife and I are currently experiencing financial difficulty and although our credit scores aren't terrible we have no savings and probably wouldn't pass a rigorous sniff test for a large loan at this time.

5) Any other advice would be helpful.

personalfinance,"Big jump in income, need to damage control first and then get on my way with saving/investing. Need help with some of the math.","I've been living on ~ 35k for the last few years- in San Francisco (I have rent control). I just accepted a job at 100k. 

The numbers

I'm a 29 year old woman. I have no partner, and do not currently plan on having kids, though I do want to keep that option open in case, you know. 

I have no savings currently and about 70k in debt (60k in student, 10 in CC) . What I have done so far is list the debts in order of interest rate so I can pay off the highest first (obviously the CC's). The student loans are pretty low- ranging from 6% down to 1.79% .  I know I will contribute max to the 401k, which doesn't match the remainder of this year but will later.

My lifestyle is pretty damn frugal (as you might expect with the low income). My rent is $875, utilities hovering around $75. I spend about $200 a month on groceries (I'm guessing here a bit) and maybe go out to eat a few times a month, max, so I say $100 for outside food and drinks. Commute is 13 block bike ride, though I signed up for pre-tax commute stipend of $150 (it'll rain someday, I'm hoping). 

I'd really like to buy a house someday. Maybe here in the bay area, though my chances of that feel pretty grim at the moment. My apartment is...ok, but not that great. It's cheap, but I would love to have a studio on my own, that would likely be about $1200 in Oakland, adding also $150 to commute costs.

 I know that I would get much better benefits/breaks/opportunities as a live-in first time home buyer, but I don't think I could afford anything here in the bay area. There's the option of buying something out of town, in another city where I have friends, but I wouldn't be able to live in it right away. That sort of math is something i'd love help with- how much a house in another city would be, that I wouldn't be living in right away, *when* I should start saving and how much I should save for downpayment.

I plan to just dump the first three paychecks into paying off the CC debt, so that's good. I have lived hyper-frugal for years, I can do it for a while longer.

I've read some places that at some point investing in retirement is better than paying off low interest debt. How do I do that math? 

To summarise my plan as I know it now:

*dump all extra cash for first few months to pay off CCs. 

*start saving (6? 3?) month emergency fund, fluid

*...and then I don't know. Pay off student loans faster? Put things into CDs or other low risk investments? Start saving for a downpayment?

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to look for a financial counselor for my wife and I? I'll explain...,"By the way my wife and I are members of a credit union. This credit union has services with a third party company to offer financial counseling. I think the services are free. Not sure though. 

We don't have any investments of any kind. Except just barely signed up for the 401K at my job. $26 richer so far woohoo! 

Upside down on car loan. SUV is worth $4,600 on low end and $7,500 on high end. We still owe $11,000 at 14.4% interest rate. 
We have tried to refinance the car loan. But no bank will take it. I wish we never signed up for this stupid car loan. We had an emergency and needed a car right away.

We have paid off 2 credit card debts so far. With more on the way. I'm not sure on this but my wife says it's better to pay off credit card debts first before building an emergency fund. 

We have an Amazon credit card that we are paying towards. It has no interest until next year. We have $700 on it. Limit is $1,000.

I have two credit cards. Both with Capital One. Credit card number one is at $2,300 balance at 19% interest rate. Limit is $2,500
Second one is currently at 500 dollars with 0% interest rate until April 2015. Limit is $2,000. We finally have a credit card with a reward! It's a 1.5% cash back. It's the one with the Samuel Jackson in the commercial. We have been very strict with it. We plan on using it like a debit card and paying it off every month. Not sure if paying it off every month will help build our credit. Will it help? 

Next is my wife's paypal account. $500 balance at 26% interest. Limit is $500. She also has a small credit card with Capital One at $158 with a 23% interest rate. This has a $200 credit limit.

We both don't have great credit since we did bankruptcy in 2010. It was mostly for medical debts. When we tried to refinance they told us since we don't have excellent credit (720 and above) they can't help us. If a couple came in with excellent credit and upside down on the existing car loan they can help them. Not us. 

We just don't have any investments except the recent 401K. No emergency fund either. Also school loans too. But I will be going back to school in August. 

Currently we are doing Dave Ramsey's plan. We both read his book.  But instead of the $1,000 emergency fund. Making payments towards the credit cards. Is this a bad idea or a bad idea? If bad please tell me why and if so I can change my ways.


What should we do? 

Should we get an affordable financial counselor to help us out?

personalfinance,Is Public Service Loan Forgiveness really worth it for me?,"Background info: spouse and I are 30.  Pre-tax, I make around 75k, he makes around 65k (our income varies based on extra shifts and commission respectively).  No kids. We just bought a home 6/2014. I am newly part of the public service loan forgiveness (PSLF) program (as of 10/2013).  No debt other than the mortgage, my student loan (see below) and his student loan of 6k. 

Details about PSLF: Basically, I make income-based payments for 10 years and the remaining balance of my loan is forgiven.  https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service

Details about my student loans:  I have 72K in loans at an interest rate of 7.375%.  I'm making income-based payments which is typically around 15% of my total yearly income. At my current income, I'm paying $580/month on the loan.  My loan would be forgiven in 2024. 

It makes sense for me pay the smallest amount required each month as I'd want the most left over at the end to be forgiven. At this rate of $580/month, I'd get around $68k forgiven. However, each time my income increases, my monthly student loan payment would go up the following year (I have to ""renew"" annually with tax forms and such). It works out that I have to keep my payments under $850/month, otherwise I'd pay off the loan in the 10th year myself with nothing left to forgive. 

That being said, my husband and I have to file married filing separately come tax time or our combined income is too high for me to benefit from the PSLF, I'd be over that magic $850/month number. 

So my question is, is PSLF worth it for me?

1)  Being a married home owner, how much am I really losing out each year at tax season by filling separately from my spouse?  It comes out to be 10 years of married filing separately returns (2014-2024). 

2)  I can dump more money into my 401k each year to lower my income but that gives us less money to put towards paying down our mortgage faster or investing.  Should I have my husband contribute less to his retirement account to make up for it? 

3)  How do I really know that this program will be around 10 years from now?  Should I just say screw it, bunker down, and tear into my loans?

personalfinance,"New college grad here, got a good job, got student loans. Now what?","Ok, here's my situation. I'm an health and life insurance agent. I'm getting paid hourly now at $11 an hour. I get overtime so after taxes I take home about $830 or so every two weeks. However I'm about to be moved from an hourly to a salaried pay. That salary will be a draw against my future commissions that I make. I assume that the salary will be a higher rate of pay. I also assume that my future commissions will be higher than my salary. So eventually I will be making straight commission. I have $60,000 in student loan debt. They are all federal subsidized and federal I subsidized loans and about $25,000 of them are federal parent plus loans.

**TL:DR - Should I attempt to sell? Should I be planning on petitioning my HOA to allow me to rent? Should I attempt to purchase another property and stop paying this mortgage?**

I have and currently reside in a condo in Illinois I had purchased in 2008. Needless to say, the value of the property had plummeted since then. Our current rules allow 25% of the units to be rented. They claimed this is due to keeping FHA status (even though I believe it has to be less than 50% investor owned). All 25% are rented, and there is a waiting list(which I am on and sees VERY little movement). I never had any intentions on renting, but my current situation has me in a bit of a mess.

On paper, I am married. This was to get my wife on to my medical insurance. Our actual wedding doesn't take place till later this year. My wife has a job that is just over 35 miles away, takes about 1.5 hours to get to via car during rush hour, and makes just over minimum wage. She used to live with me and make this commute. 5 days of 13+ hrs for next to nothing took a huge toll on her. She found an apartment and a roommate and moved out. Her lease ends in September.

My job is secure. I make around 80k pre tax. I have ~25k in savings.
I still owe ~155k on the place + around 5k to the fed from the 2008 tax credit. The units have been selling for less than 150k. Add in realtor fees, and that is something I cannot afford.

I would like to live with my wife. She cannot live in the condo I own due to the massive commutes to work. I cannot afford 2 mortgages or 1 rental and 1 mortgage. She makes very little. Do I have a case? 

What is the best way for me to proceed? I'm becoming quite desperate.
Sell? Petition for hardship? A couple other ideas I was thinking was to petition the board to increase the number of rentals. I highly doubt they will do this, but I'm becoming desperate.
If that doesn't work, I was thinking of doing some form of ""sale"" in which the buyer pays the ""seller"" monthly payments of $XXXX. I spoke to an attorney about this, and he does not recommend it.

Food: 400 (sometimes less)/ month

Transportation: 290.75

Cell phones (2 phones, 2 year contract): 116/month

Finance Tracker (Very helpful): 10/month

Netflix: 9/month

Entertainment: 300/month split between the both of us (150 each or 40 a week per person)


**DEBTS:**

Combined 116K in student debt

No CC debt, or other kinds of debt. We have one credit card with a limit of 700, but it's only for ultra emergencies, and it's always immediately paid off. Haven't used it in 2 years.


Right now, we're paying exactly 1916 a month on our loans, which is an extra 800 a month. All of our taxes we get in the beginning of the year goes straight toward our loans. We've paid off 4 so far and are paying another off in August. We're using the Snow Ball method and it's been working great. Our lowest loans have the highest interest rates (6-6.8%) and our lowest interest rates are on our 30K loans which is good.


**OTHER FINANCIALS**
SAVINGS: $4600

Jobs don't offer 401ks or anything like that. They're very small companies so not many benefit besides income, health insurance and a great working environment.

Both of us are set for raises this year, so if things go well, our financial situation will improve.

We have no other investments.


**QUESTION:**

I just want to know if what we're doing is smart. We're living relatively comfortably, especially for NYC, and do a lot of free things like walking through parks and stuff on the weekends, and we have a lot of video games and things like netflix to keep us occupied. Should we get a Roth IRA or is that after our loans are paid off in 5 years (give or take)? Should we be putting the 300 for savings into loans instead?

I feel like what we're doing now is working very well, but I feel like we're behind the curve with the amount of debt we have and our ages.

personalfinance,Advice considering bankruptcy,"Personal summary:  I recently emerged from a lawsuit that I filed against a franchise for an alleged food poisoning incident that put me in the hospital.  Jury sided with the franchise.  The judge ruled that I wouldn't have to pay the attorney's fees, but I would be responsible for court costs (~$5000 with 4.75% annual interest).

I am considering filing bankruptcy to get out of these costs.  I am currently in my early twenties with no assets, income, or significant credit.  I have just finished my first year of medical school (I know that my student loans won't be discharged by the bankruptcy).  I am three years away from making any money at all as a resident (~45,000 a year average), and then another three to five years away from whatever that other money is down the road.

If I declare bankruptcy now, it will cost around $1000 to file with all costs included.  What I'm wondering is this: will I ultimately save money in the long run by filing now and having the bankruptcy on my credit history for the next ten years?  How hard will it be to get a competitive interest rate on a credit card, mortgage, or any other loan when I'm farther down the road during my residency or immediately afterward?

I love my non-internship job, but they seem uninclined to give me more than weekend hours. He is also still looking for other work/better paying work in his field of expertise.




I work 2 jobs right now, unfortunately even with both I am not at full-time hours. One is technically an internship, which provides 20hrs/week at  minimum ($9/hr). The other is weekends only (though I have asked for more hours), 13 hrs/week at $9.50/hr. I am seeking a third job, preferably evenings since the internship isn't always the same schedule (though I will force it there in a heartbeat if I need to). 




I have no student debt, one old credit line bill I just found out about (aprox $200), and currently my personal monthly bills are as follows:
Phone: $40. Netflix: $8. Entertainment: $48. = $96.




He works 30-40hrs/week, @ I think 9.50. These are ballpark debt figures as I can't find our folder right now. 
Student loans: 1 @ about 2k, 1 @ 15k?
Credit cards: 1 @ 1.5k, 1@ 3k  [These are not currently used]
Verizon: ~$500 (early term fee + a month or so from when we were unemployed)
Comcast: ~$50
His bills: Entertainment: $30 ish? Gas: $500+? (his commute is short, ~10mins, but his car has issues). 




Shared: Groceries: $~300/mth. I need to track this better, and budget/plan meals better. 
Eating out: Way too much (we have been bad about having lunch food at home, this is being changed).


We don't pay rent, don't have a car payment...





Now, 
I make about $1,180/mth, he makes about $1,000 (ball park, estimating low). 



His car is shot. I am having it looked at to see if there are any cheap things to keep it running, but right now it's running horribly and guzzles gas. Not good. Completely fixing it would cost far more than the car is worth. I do not have a car.



He wants to move out, and so do I. However, we haven't payed off any debt yet, don't have savings yet, and we don't make enough to pay rent. Plus our work isn't stable yet. I'm working on reminding him of the logic here, but I do understand how frustrating it is to be in our living situation. In addition, we have animals (rabbits), which means most apartments are a no-go. They can stay at my parents house, but then I have an added commute expense to care for them.



We are also looking ahead, and while we can't start saving quite yet (paying off debt is more important), our plan is to build a tiny house as soon as we can. 



So. We need a 'new' (to us) car that will run for commute to/from work, and we need to pay off debt. We need to start saving, but imo that is lower priority than getting rid of debt right now.



**Thoughts? Logic? I'm familiar with both the snowball and avalanche methods. I lean more towards the snowball method, as right now we are still both at the stage of being overwhelmed. I don't know the interest rates, but I'm sitting down with him tonight &amp; having him pull his credit karma so we can get started. He has been avoiding it a bit, not ignoring it, just anxiety that we both deal with.**

Current Debt: $0

Basically I'm wondering what makes most sense in my situation for going back to college. I plan on going to Community College for two years, then transfer to a University.  My hours at work aren't completely flexible, so there's a possibility that I may not be able to go to school full-time while working full-time as well. This will differ semester to semester, I might be able to go full-time one semester, but  I may only be able to take one or two classes the next. But once I finish school and I (hopefully) land a job soon after, my income will just about double.

So here's my questions. I would like everyone to respond as if you were in my situation.

1.	**Would it make more sense to work only part-time** while going to school to guarantee that I'm able to go to school full-time. In which case I wouldn't be able to save as much (my income would reduce by about 40%). But I would achieve my goal quicker, versus achieving my goal slower but saving more money at the same time. 

2.	**What should I do with my current savings and my future earnings**, should I use my income to pay for tuition to reduce (or completely eliminate) the amount of debt while going to school? Should I try to save my earnings and just keep it in savings while relying on federal aid and loans to get through school. Another option would to try to contribute more to my Company's 401K or my Roth IRA while attending school on loans.",finance,1405197012

personalfinance,I am thinking of buying a new car. I can't believe it.,"Dear /r/personalfinance

After a couple years of both giving and receiving helpful advice from this community, I am finding myself considering what I had sworn to never do. I spend $25k on a new car.

About me: Almost 28, ~190k net worth, no debt, $110k/yr income. Just moved across North America for my dream job.

What I find appealing about buying new:

* I want to treat myself. I've worked my ass off since I moved out on my own with nothing ten years ago and I feel like I deserve it.
* I bought a really crappy used car a few years ago and it sucked. It looked terrible, it ran poorly and depreciated almost its entire value over the years.
* I want to not worry about the thing breaking down all the time. The warranty on a new car might help with this.
* I love the look and feel of this car. I've never really liked my car, or any of my parents cars, and the idea that I can actually like my car is exciting.
* The thought of owning something amazing like a new car makes me feel important.
* Being able to choose my options/color/trim/features is definitely novel
* I need to buy a car anyway.
* Cash incentives (it's a $35k car with $1k cash back, $7500 fed rebate and $1500 state rebate = $25k)

What I am worried about:

* I choose my new car poorly
* My needs/tastes change in a few years
* I choose the wrong financing option (all cash/small loan/large loan/lease)
* I weigh my current emotions too strongly in this decision. I'm feeling lonely &amp; stressed and I stated above, maybe I'm just looking for a way to treat myself.
* I am betraying my previously strong idea that buying a new car is the worst possible financial decision.

personalfinance,Questions about credit cards and savings accounts,"I have an emergency fund and a budget. My e-fund isn't complete yet (~25% complete), but I am a student and my parents still help me out so I am not too worried about getting it up to what I need immediately ($0 in student loans as well).

First question: I want to get a savings account that gets decent interest.  I found [this bank](https://www.gecapitalbank.com/savings-products/online-savings.html?prod=SAV). Is this a good bank or is there one better? I looked at credit unions around but their interest rates are on-par with my current bank (PNC) 

So I applied there and I got denied for an account... twice. I recently moved as I usually move once a year (student). Obviously they can't tell me *why*, but could it be because I moved recently? What else could it be? I never had any delinquent accounts or anything.

Second question: Currently I have a Capital One Journey Student Rewards with a credit limit of $300, which is sort of low and the rewards aren't great. I have had it for 5 months so I should be getting a credit limit increase after this statement. Is it a bad idea to get a new credit card? I see it as only positive because the average age wouldn't be hurt by opening a new card. I have heard good things about Discover It. I have a credit score of ~720 according to CreditKarma and the CapitalOne credit simulator. Thoughts?

personalfinance,Capitalone (US) CC any way to appeal account limit raise denial?,"I have (had?) a Capitalone Orbitz rewards card.  When I got it about 5 years ago I had much crappier credit than I do now, and they only approved me for a $300 limit.  Couldn't really use it for what I intended to (plane tickets) because of the low limit, but paid bill on time, almost never carried a balance and have built my credit up considerably from where I was when I got it, as well as completely paid off both my federal and private student loans.  I admit I often use up to 80% of the available credit on this card but pay off monthly because the amount is so small.

Fast forward to this month, Capitalone sends me a letter saying that the Orbitz rewards have been discontinued, they're converting all my unused Orbitz points to cash (Got $120!) its now a ""Journey"" card but still the same $300 limit, applied for a CLI, they sent me a letter 2 days later saying ""Credit line increases are not available upon request for this type of account"".  Letter says nothing about outstanding debt or credit score or anything else.

politics,Making child support a function of how custodial time is split creates an evil profit motive to seize custody.,"It has been my experience (twice!) that Mom goes for primary custody because she wants the child support. The current Massachusetts child support formula makes the amount of child support depend too much on the split of custodial time. I think that more parents would amicably agree to 50/50 shared parenting, if it wasn't for this unfortunate monetary incentive.

The math underlying the Massachusetts child support calculation gives way too much weight to the division of custodial time. It makes the division of custodial time a battle ground that has nothing to do with the child's best interest, and everything to do with GREED.

Think about it: what expenses vary, if Susy's parents have a 50/50 split versus a 70/30 split?
 
This is what the USDA child cost calculator:

   http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/calculatorintro.htm

says these are the costs for a single parent who earns more than $60K a year, to raise a 9-year-old for one year:

    Housing   Food   Transportation   Clothing   Health Care   Child Care and Education   Other    TOTAL

    7,714   3,973       3,032          813         1,484              5,212              2,464    24,491

Which of those expenses varies, depending on the split of custodial time?

Not housing. Susy needs a bedroom for 5 nights a week or 2 nights a week.

Not transportation. Mom and Dad each own a car. The car payment doesn't vary with the custodial schedule.

Clothing, health car, child care, other? Nope, the split of custodial time is irrelevant to those categories.

The ONLY item that varies depending on the division of custodial time -- is FOOD.

And food is a pretty trivial expense.

If the custodial split is 50/50, then the parents would each pay (3973 / 2 =) $1986/year for food for Susy.

If the split is 70/30, then the custodial parent would pay (3973 * .7 =) $2781/year, which is (2781 - 1986 =) $795/year MORE than she would if the schedule was 50/50. That's $15/week more expense for Mom, because she has her child 70% of the time.

Mom pays $15/week more for Susy because she has Susy 70% of the time.

Under the Mass Child Support Guidelines, if both parents earn $60,000/year, then the non-custodial parent (assumed to have one-third of the child's custodial time) pays $229/week in child support. That is (229 - 15 =) $214/week more than the $15/week EXTRA expense that Mom incurs, because she feeds the child 9 more meals per week than Dad, with a 70/30 split.

That's $214/week PROFIT for the custodial parent -- $214 MORE than Mom's actual extra expense.

When Mom gets primary custody, her child becomes a nice little profit center: $214/week is $11,128/year of *tax free* money. At a 35% income tax rate, that's the equivalent of $17,120 pre-tax dollars. That's how much more the custodial parent gets IN EXCESS of the additional costs she incurs, because she has her child 70% of the time -- instead of 50% of the time.

For taking care of Susy two more evenings per week than Dad, Mom gets the equivalent of a $17,120 BOUNTY.

It's a nice little racket.

For many Dads, it is doubly enraging, because he wants more time with his daughter. By going for the money, Mom deprives Dad of precious time with his daughter, IN ADDITION TO the $17,120/year. Dad is doubly screwed.

 

How do we remove the profit motive?

One way would be to do build apply math like that I've shown above, in the child support guidelines. If Mom was going to get only $15/week to compensate her for providing more meals than Dad, then Mom would have much less incentive to pursue primary custody. If Mom thinks Dad is a good parent, then I think Mom would be ENTHUSED about a 50/50 split, because she knows that their daughter will get good parenting from Dad, AND MOM COULD USE A BREAK FROM DOING THE LION'S SHARE OF THE PARENTING. The result: many many many more quick, amicable divorces.

The child support calculation should vary ONLY A LITTLE depending on the custody split, reflecting the fact that the only cost that varies with custodial time is the trivial expense: FOOD.

 

Another way to remove the profit motive, would be to ELIMINATE child support and substitute division of ACTUAL EXPENSES.

The child support laws officially refrain from requiring that child support benefit the child. It's ironic, because the noble-sounding standard ""best interest of the child"" would certainly seem to imply that the child should benefit from what might amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars of child support.

Not so. The custodial parent can spend the child support on plastic surgery, her boyfriend, contributions to the Republican Party, or shoes. Nothing guarantees that Mom will spend ONE DIME on the child. Presumably, most parents with primary custody are good parents who love their children and use the child support to improve their child's life. There is no requirement for that, however, under the law, and there are many, many examples of child support benefiting the child marginally or not at all. For the vast majority of custodial parents, child support is just income that goes into the checking account and gets spent however Mom likes. It is NOT earmarked for the child.

Why not? Why doesn't the ""best interest of the child"" standard REQUIRE that child support is spent for the child's benefit?

I don't know why. Maybe it's because the Court does not want to get involved in disputes about whether particular expenditures benefit the child. Mom buys a bigger house, so now her daughter can fit five girlfriends in her bedroom for a sleep-over, instead of three. Is that an acceptable use of child support? Reasonable people could disagree.

I suspect, however, that it's an artifact of history. In olden days, the accounting would have been too difficult.

That's no longer the case. It would be super-simple to implement an ""actual expenses"" model, through the use of CREDIT CARDS. Mom and Dad each have a credit card that is exclusively for the purpose of paying for their child's expenses. Who buys the clothes? It doesn't matter, because if just Mom or just Dad or BOTH buy clothes for their daughter, it all works out, because in the end, they will split the cost. Who pays the co-payment at the pediatricians? Doesn't matter, it's on the card, and the expense will be shared. Soccer team? Card. There are few things that cannot be put onto a credit card, nowadays. For those things, parents can write checks that draw on the same accounts.

At regular intervals, whoever has spent less on the child would compensate the other parent.

The credit cards could be misused, e.g. Dad buys his girlfriend clothes. That could be handled by requiring parents to use a smartphone app that takes a photo of the purchased item and associates it with a debit on the charge card. ""You did NOT buy that lingerie for our nine-year-old!!"" The app could include a service that reviews the photos and charges and throws out the inappropriate purchases. The service could include conflict resolution: Mom thinks that the family YMCA membership should go on the card, Dad thinks that only HALF should go on the card because Mom uses the gym and he doesn't. The service decides who is right. Perhaps appeals could be handled by a live on-line mediator provided by the app company, for a fee. The Court would be a last resort for egregious cases. The divorce agreement would list categories and items that may or may not be paid for using the child support credit card. Uninsured medical expenses would be on the list.

The BIG BIG WIN is that ALL the money benefits the child, GUARANTEED. A lot of non-custodial parents would be much more cheerful about paying child support, because they would know they are helping their precious child.

With this system, I would deem it appropriate for the parents to pay in proportion to their after-tax income. If Dad has twice as much after-tax as Mom, then he should pay two-thirds of the credit card charges. There should be some reasonable limits on expenditures, based on the USDA figures, perhaps. One parent should not be obliged to pay when the other parent buys one of each item sold by Abercrombies, during her manic phase. Call the app mediator to get those charges rolled back.
 

Why change the Mass child support math? Is it broken? YES IT IS.

Consider the two parents who each make $60,000. Under the Mass formula, the non-custodial parent pays $229/week. How does that affect each parent's standard of living?

Let's say that the overall tax on $60K, including federal and state income taxes and FICA, is 35%. Therefore, each of the parents has an after-tax income of (60,000 * (1 - .35) =) $39,000.

Applying the $229/week child support figure, the custodial parent's after-tax income goes up to (39,000 + (229 * 52) =) $50,908.

The non-custodial parent's disposable income falls to ($39,000 - (229 * 52) =) $27,092.

   Mom: $50,908
   Dad: $27,092

MOM HAS ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH MONEY TO SPEND THAN DAD, EVEN THOUGH THEY EARN THE SAME SALARY.

She has 88% more money, actually, after taxes and child support -- even though she and he make the same amount of money. Her standard of living goes up 25% and his goes down 25% -- because she has their daughter two more nights a week than him and spends $15/week more on food -- even though Dad would LOVE to have more time with his daughter.

That's just WRONG.

It's slightly less horribly unfair, when Mom makes $30K/year and Dad makes $60K. In that case, she ends up with $32K/year of disposable income, compared to his $26.5K/year. He earns twice as much and ends up with 20% less, because Mom insisted on having two more nights a week than Dad.

ALSO WRONG.

That kind of arithmetic has nothing to do with the child's best interest. How does it help Susy, if her Mom can afford a bigger house but Dad has to rent a crappy one-bedroom? What effect does it have on Susy, when Mom gloats about how she stuck it to Dad? Is it good for Susy, that Dad is filled with resentment about his onerous child support, that benefits his ex-wife more than his daughter?

personalfinance,Need A Whole Lot of Advice,"So there's a lot of negative things that has been happening in my life right now and I'm probably not in the best emotional-mental state to be posting this so I'll try my best to be concise. 

I am a university student who has taken a break from school this past spring semester because I was placed on financial hold.  Last time I was registered was fall as a full-time student that was working part-time.  I have about $8000 I owe to the school before I can register again.  Since this balance was from last summer (I've been taking summer classes each year so this has been stretching out most of my financial aid/personal finances), I found out last Wednesday that it's gone to campus collections and if I don't act on it soon, it'll go to a regular/private collection agency.  I double major in Computer Science and Political Science and the CS program at my school is usually a 5-year track instead of 4 so that's why I've been taking a lot of credits each semester including the summers (usually 17+).  One main reason why I was hit hard last fall was because I got hospitalized a couple times (2 times for one week+ plus a few ER visits) - had school health 'insurance' so really didn't have any at the time.  I say this because I have SCA, a chronic, hereditary disease and I often have mild to severe pain episodes plus generally being fatigued and more susceptible to other illnesses (a common cold/flu could put me in the hospital for weeks because I'd end up contracting something else).  I have to take A LOT of medications daily because of it - but I haven't for several months now because money.

I have very low expenses now - I'm with my parents in a really unhealthy and abusive environment.  I don't pay rent or utilities/internet thankfully, I pay for myself when it comes to other areas.

**Rent** - $0

**Utilities** - $0

**Food** - ~$100

**Transportation** - $100

**Gas** - $150

**School Balance** - $8000 (I can't stall because it may go to collections any day now.)

**Hospital Bills** - $1046 (They're in three separate accounts, I have no idea why.)

**One** - $600

**Two** - $396 (This one is from a hospital I've never went to so I'm really confused about it.  I tried calling twice but I didn't get an actual person, I found out about this one last week - it came to my old roommate not to my current address.)

**Three** - $50 (I'll pay this off soon once I get the letter, I didn't even know about this one, only when I called about another account, the collector told me about this.)

Credit Card Debit - $0

I am unemployed right now - was laid off from my temporary retail job two weeks ago, it hit me hard.  I was paying off bills and saving up for school (trying to pay something off, it went mostly to late charges) and for an apartment.  I go to school in a different city that's about an hour away.  I've dipped into my meager savings to pay off a hospital bill and to pay for transportation/gas/food.  I've been looking for any job, I have an interview Monday, but I'm still so scared that I won't get it. 

I've applied to Medicaid a bunch of times, the last time was last week so hopefully I get approved this time.  I've visited the financial aid and billing offices of my school so many times about what can be done in order to get back.  Federal loans aren't an option because this $8,000 are past due balances and because they can't disburse my package until after I register but I can't register if it's not paid for.  I've talked with different fin. aid advisers and tried to get something settled.  They say private loans or a payment plan, can't do payment plans because I'd need to pay the balance in full before registering and that would definitely take a year or more, not a option for me. I can't stay with my parents any longer, seriously tried (been with them since November), but I can't. I get hit often and yelled at and I don't do anything to provoke such outrage.  Just an hour ago, my mom punched me 10 times on my head as I was backed into the corner, my dad tried to ward her off though.  I don't have a car in an area that requires it so I'm stuck inside most of the day, no friends, hardly any family, I've been making up classes so that keeps me busy.  

Please suggest ANYTHING and criticize what I could do to produce better results.  I do have some questions: I have two credit cards with 0 balances, is it possible to lease a used car on it?  I'm always having trouble getting to school and work (also thinking of living in car...).  If leasing is not an option, what about buying?  I just want something under $3000 that can run and at least survive 3/4 more months.  Are there really private loans that don't require a cosigner?  I don't have one and I've been looking and even a lot of the big banks require it.  My credit score is good - it's young though and has very little history.  I have two credits, a debit, and student loans with no delinquencies.  

OK I'm seriously sorry about this hell of a post, this was so far from short and to the point, hope I'm being clear here.  I don't know what to do.  I can't stop myself from crying and freaking out about my situation all the time and I'm at my wit's end.  I just want to be stable with everything.  Thank you truly to anyone that managed to read even half of this.",finance,1405226173
financialindependence,Anybody with a relatively high income (25/28% federal bracket) contributing to a Roth 401(k)?,"The conventional advice is if you're a relatively high income earner--let's say the 25 or 28% federal bracket or higher--you should prefer tax-deductible retirement contributions over Roth whenever possible, because your tax rate is likely higher now than it will be in retirement. I'm wondering if there may be a caveat to this for people pursuing ER.

Let's take the case of ordinary pre-tax versus Roth 401(k), as there's a lot of special considerations for IRAs. Here are some advantages for Roth:

* Higher effective contribution limit, i.e. $17,500 in a Roth 401(k) is worth more than $17,500 in a regular 401(k) because taxes have already been paid
* After retiring, you could rollover a Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA, and withdraw contributions without tax or penalty before age 59½, which may be important for ER
* Less concern about what happens with tax rates in the future, which may be important if you'll be retired for a while

Are these or perhaps other reasons that I may not have thought of enough for people to contribute to Roth accounts when they could deduct instead? Or does the tax savings outweigh all of this?",finance,1405231339
personalfinance,Okay. Here it is in all of its glory. What do you recommend we should do?,"Warning: Long post.  My last post my fellow Redditors wanted more specific details. I had to make a new post.

My wife and I really want to be out of debt and in a better position.

I work for a truck and trailer repair shop. I work in the parts department. I come from a background of mostly warehouse work. The pay was abysmal. Usuallly $9-$10 an hour. I started out as the parts driver making $11 an hour. Now I'm a parts clerk.  I make $15 an hour now. Most money I have made since I have started working.I work 40 hours a week. It's a challenge for me because I don't know the diesel industry that well. But I'm still learning new things every day. 

 I'm glad my boss gave me a chance. I still worry about getting fired. I'm sometimes very anxious about this. Don't really want to go back to working for staffing agencies *bleh*

My wife works for a childcare center. Making $10.50 an hour. She works 28 hours a week. She has been with the company for close to 10 years. The owners are very tight wads. I tell her all the time she should be making more than this with her experience. But living in Utah childcare teachers are not paid that well. She really wants to stay home and take care of our son Liam who is 16 months old. 


Monthly expenses (rough estimate on some things)

Groceries: Between Costco and the grocery store $200-$300 a month.
 
Rent: $750 (mother in law owns the house)

Cable + Internet: $65 a month

Car insurance $75 a month

Tmobile: $150 a month

Fuel for two vehicles: $200-$230 depending on gas prices. 

I get my haircut either once a month or every three weeks. I get it at Great Clips since it's so close to the house and they know how I like my haircut. I pay $14 for this haircut. My hair grows really fast lol.

Monthly debt:
My old Capital One balance currently stands at $2,217.Limit is $2,500 Interest rate is 19.80% Minimum payment now stands at $61 dollars
My new Capital One cc is $400 used with a limit of $2,000 dollars. 0% interest rate until April of 2015.Not sure on the minimum. I just paid more than the minimum. We plan on using this cc as a debit card to help build our abysmal credit scores.


My wife's Capital One is at $174 with an interest rate of 22.90%. Her  limit is $200. Minimum due is $25

Amazon store credit card is currently at $650. Limit is $800 and 0% interest until next year. Minimum due is $30 a month.

We owe my mother in law as well. She has helped out tremendously. She put it on her Visa credit card when she helped us out. Current balance is $2,100 and with an interest rate of 9%. We have been paying $100 as part of our rent. 

Also my wife's grandma. Sweetest woman in the world. I want to pay her back as soon as possible. She has helped us out. When our transmission went out on our Mazda Tribute. We currently owe her $3,000 We are not diligent on paying her every month. Life happens sometimes but she is very understanding. I feel bad for borrowing money from her.

Paypal credit card balance is at $490 with a limit of $500. Interest rate is 26%. Minimum $30.

Stupid stupid car loan. Owe $11,000 on the 2008 Mazda Tribute. $340 a month and at 14.4% interest rate. Tried to refinance twice. No bank will touch it because how upside down it is and we both don't have the best credit. We did medical bankruptcy in 2010. Also we don't have a co-signer and we don't want one. 

Explaining the high cost of our Tmobile bill. Still paying on our current smartphones. We still $300 on my phone and my wife's iPhone $500. Paying this off would give us an extra 50 every month. No interest.

We both have student loans. I will be going back to school next month. I'm very excited. I don't want to compete anymore for warehouse work with high school graduates. I really want to improve our lives and provide financial security for my small family. 

I did apply to be a Lyft driver to make ends meet. Also my wife does swagbucks and makes $100 a month doing that. 

We both are shop cheap recently We shop at Savers and other second hand stores in our town. No gym memberships here either. Only membership we have is the Costco membership.

We both have tremendously cut back on going out to eat and other small purchases.

Whew! I am really hoping to get good serious and solid advice. We both are following Dave Ramsey's advice and we also own YNAB. 

Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,Advice for personal business,"I'm 24, just graduated college, and at the beginning of this year I started a new IT job.  The job situation is kind of weird because technically I'm not considered an employee of the company, I'm considered a contractor.  As such, when I started working, my new ""boss"" suggested that I get an LLC, that way I can deduct any expenses I might incur.  So right now, I do work and the money I earn goes to a bank account I opened for my LLC.  I then pay myself by transferring money from my LLC's bank account to my personal bank account.

When I first started, I worked from home in the apartment I'm renting(therefore I had my own office and own computer equipment).  However, after about 3 months, my boss opened an office and wanted to me start coming in to work with him.  So now I have ~30 minute commute every day to go to the office and am now using equipment/space that he's paying for.


So I have a few questions:


1) I've been setting aside %40 of my income for taxes since taxes are no longer automatically withheld from my paycheck.  Any advice on what to do with this money until tax season comes?  I have ~$30,000 just sitting in my bank account, and I feel like it could be doing something better than just sitting there.

2) Any advice for retirement savings?  I opened a Roth IRA through my financial adviser at the beginning of this year and maxed out 2013's and 2014's contributions.  My statement says its with FESGX - First Eagle Global Fund Class C (Does that sound right?  Is this a good place to be?).

3) Any advice on tax deductions?  I'm technically considered self-employed, so I'll be hit with the self-employment tax this year in addition to the regular state/federal taxes.  I was hoping to be able to deduct money for my commute to working, but after looking online it doesn't appear I can do that.  FWIW, I am planning on having an accountant do my taxes for this year and I'm sure he'll be able to help me here, but I'd like to be informed beforehand just so I know I'm maximizing my money.

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Payoff vs. Larger Car Payment,"Reddit- longtime lurker, first time poster looking for some advice on a decision my husband and I are considering.  We are purchasing a new car (2015 Scion XB, listed at $18,000 at our local dealership) at the end of July.  My inlaws are gifting us $5000 for this, and we are going to add $2000 from our personal savings.  In addition, I have stock options at my company that I am selling for $3500.  We were initially going to use the stock money to make a $10,000 down payment on the car and take out a 4 year car loan with approx 3% interest.  However, one of my federal student loans has a balance of $3000 with a 6% interest rate so we are considering using stock money to pay off that student loan that has 7 years left on repayment terms instead.

Here is the math:
$5000 gift for car + $2000 savings + $35000 stock money = $10,500 cash pool

Option 1:
$18000 car - $10000 down payment with a 4 year auto loan at 3% = ~$177 per month
$50 fixed student loan payment at 6% interest for next 7 years

Option 2:
$18,000 car - $7500 down payment with a 4 year auto loan at 3% = $224 per month
$3500 student loan at 6% paid off = no more $50 payments for 7 years

The difference between the two loans is about the same as the student loan payment so we are leaning more towards paying off the student loan and paying more for the car per month.  Is there any negative/downside to this that we're not seeing or is this the right way to go?",finance,1405254356

personalfinance,[Canadian/Ontarian] OSAP related question,"All my friends are making fun of me because I'm paying off my OSAP as soon as I can; transferring every dollar that comes my way towards my debt.


To me this only seems logical. Lower interest payout and a boost in credit as I clear my debt ahead of schedule. Is there something that I'm missing here?


It's kind of embarrassing but I do not know the interest rate on the OSAP loan to share with the rest of you. I'm sure someone out there is more knowledgeable and could share it in this thread. It used to be around 3.5% but now I think they restructured all OSAP loans to be that 3.5% + some federal tax. 


Without any personal finance savvy, I used to figure it wasn't important to know what it was. Either way I have to pay it so, who cares? Being in this subreddit I'm starting to understand the concept of the possibility of investing the money elsewhere where it can return a higher ROR than the interest of the debt. 


I'm not 100% comfortable with that concept so I turn to you! Please advise guys! Should I be lowering my monthly payment as much as possible and potentially invest it elsewhere, or, continue having no life to pay off my balance as soon as possible?



Thanks in advance!

Edit: Found a definition and still don't know what my interest rate is (my guess now would be ~10.5%):

""On the provincial part of your OSAP loan, the rate is the prime rate of interest plus 1%. On the federal portion interest rate can be the prime rate of interest plus 2.5%. 6 month grace period: You do not have to begin repaying your student loan for 6 months after completing your studies.""",finance,1405264086

*  After my other expenses I have 1300/mo to use in these categories.

So my plan was to take all the 1300/mo and put it solely to my student loans until my employer match starts and then at that point, pay the minimums on my student loans with the rest going to my 401k, since the 401k match is a better return, and some student loan interest is tax deductible.  
When paying the minimum on my student loans I would net about 12K/yr in my 401k, so not yet at the federal limits.  Is it wise to not put any money into a Ira (or anything else), so long as I am not hitting the limits on my 401k? 

Overall, does this seem like a good financial plan?  Any suggestions?",finance,1405272975

personalfinance,I have an idle Money Market IRA account with $11k and a 0.1 interest rate. Should I withdraw the money and take the IRS penalty?,"So at my previous job, in lieu of a 401k they would deposit money into a personal Money Market IRA every year. I ended up leaving after 3 years and since then I've had about $11,000 just sitting in that account. 

Since then I've been working at a job with a typical 401k matching plan and I've opened a Roth IRA that I've maxed out annually. I also have enough savings to handle an unexpected emergency.

What should I do with this money sitting in the Money Market IRA? The low interest rate means it's losing value over time due to inflation (it earned a whopping $24.34 in interest last year). I could use it to pay off some student loans (3.5% - 4.5%) or my car (2.93%). However, there's an IRS penalty for withdrawing before I'm 60 years old (a looooong way off) and I'll also be responsible for income taxes on that money. Does anyone know what the IRS penalty would be?

personalfinance,Defer student loans until smaller loans are paid? Will this save me or hurt me in the end?,"Ramsey wonk here in need of advice. I'm paying off three debts from small to big (snowball payoff plan). They are:

Credit card (~$2100, should be paid off in 3 months)
Car loan (~$4750, should be paid off in about 7 months)
Federal student loan (~$infinity, should be paid off in about 20 billion years)


Since I'm using the snowball method to pay off the smaller CC first and making minimum payments on car and student loans, would it be smart for me to put the student loans under some kind of temporary deferment or forbearance or whatever? I haven't really investigated this much yet but I do see the ""I'm having trouble making my monthly payment"" link on the student loan website. 

If possible, should I put off my monthly $350 student loan payments and throw that money first the CC/car loans instead? I feel like it might actually benefit me to do that (unless there are negative repercussions on my permanent financial record) since it would likely cut down on interest paid in the end on all of those accounts.

I am a 25 year old college grad with about $125k in student debt that I've been paying on (with some help from my parents) for the past 2 years since graduating (started at about $140k). My biggest loan is with Sallie Mae (three loans 4-5% interest) totalling about $117k, and I have three federal stafford loans each around 6-7% totalling $7500 or so. 

My monthly payment between all the loans totals about $1250... which is a tremendous stretch for me. I work as a supervisor in a non-profit social services agency taking home $42k annually, no substantial raise in sight at this point. I am paying about $600 a month towards my loans out of my salary on top of my other living expenses, and the other $650 is coming out of my personal savings (~$5k) and the tail end of two college investment accounts (~$3.5k total). 

So my question is this - I will end up draining either my savings acct. or the investment accounts to contribute to this bill. Should I pay with the cash I have in the bank, or start by cashing out the investments?

personalfinance,Help tackling debt and general financial advice.,"Ok. So I am just coming to terms with the terrible financial situation I've gotten myself into. I've spent my twenties basically ignoring my student loans, which have gotten out of control. I have been making decent money this entire time, but have been largely irresponsible and am looking to change my ways and get out of debt. I am very good theoretically with money, have all of my income and expenditures documented, as well as a budget spreadsheet which includes allotted money for savings and investment, I just never stick to it. I make more than enough to pay for my modest lifestyle and pay down my debt, I'm only now coming into the mindset to do it. Here is the breakdown.

Income from Bartending is around $55,000 after taxes ($4600/mo)
Various other income around $500/mo 


Student Loans are: 

$53000 in my own name at varying interest rates ranging from 3.4-8.0% - interest only payment is around $260/mo

$83,000 in my mother's name at 8% - Interest only payment is around $664/mo

$12,000 in credit card debt ranging from 19-28%

$2100 in IRS tax debt.

$1500 in ""savings"" (barely counts), no emergency fund, no investments. 

Monthly Expenses are $2010 which include rent, insurance, gym membership and both student loan payments, as well as debt payments of $50 to a collection account which is almost payed off, $50 to the IRS but not credit card payments.

My intuition tells me to spend the next few months where my income is higher (around $6,000/mo, it's our busy season) building a 6 month emergency fund, then tackling my credit cards one by one starting with the highest interest rate. Once those are payed off moving on to the highest student loan rates and working my way down. Total debt is around $140k, so it will take some time, but I also have a small business that I'm working on growing to help tackle the problem. My other issue is the loans in my mother's name. She is out of work on disability and the loans were taken out with the intention of me paying them back. They were originally $40k, but she neglected them  for years before I even knew about them and they have accrued over $40,000 in fees and interest (yeah, that sucks). I don't know whether to eventually work on paying them down, or just make minimum payments until I've hit the 25 year forgiveness or she passes away (she is young and in relatively good health despite having MS) I don't mean to sound harsh, I'm just trying to look at it like an economist.

On another note my parents' financial situation is awful as is their credit, so as of now a consolidation loan is not possible as far as I know. This is an option that I can consider in the future, as we are working on improving their situation as well.

investing,Tax Withholding / Allowances and Investing Question,"Hello,

I've been slowly getting my feet wet with investing, and recently I had a crazy thought enter my mind. Why am I giving the USA an interest free loan every single year? By that I mean withholdings from my paycheck. 

This isn't so much about asking for allowance advice, but I did have a few questions, and I am hoping someone on here can point me in the right direction. 

Assuming I can even do this, is it a sane idea to crank up my allowance # by as much as possible? I am on salary, let's say I get paid $1000 every single week, and it's always the same amount. 

Currently about 25% of that is going to federal / state / medical, etc. If I could reduce federal withholding to say, $10 a pay check instead of $125 and then just invest $115 each week into an ETF, would this be something that is considered ""normal"" or ""sane"" to an investor? 

I am already putting in 6% of each paycheck into my 401K account through work, but I feel like investing $400/mo into ETFs would be a better option than just waiting for the end of the tax season to get my 
taxes back.

Obviously, I realize this could be potentially dangerous. If the ETFs all take a dive, then when Uncle Sam asks me to pay, I'd be screwed, but I still have a decent savings account to back me up. 

**EDIT**: I will pay my full tax amount every year. I won't actually wait for the IRS to knock on my door and ask me to pay taxes. I know when they are due :)

Anyway, do any of you do something like this? Do you have any advice for someone who wants to move in this direction? 

**TL;DR: It doesn't sound like this is legal, unless you have already paid 90% of your yearly taxes, and at that point my idea isn't any better than buying Budlight over a higher quality beer, and just investing that saved money into an ETF, which sounds like an even worse idea.**",finance,1405287715

You'll have something to show for your money that you can sell back?

personalfinance,How do I calculate the loan amount when the loan is in forbearance?,"I have a personal loan that I have been given by a family member.

I am keeping track of this loan (and all of my others) in an Excel spreadsheet.

My short story: I am from a very poor family who was able to graduate with a 4 year degree. I just received a job offer that will pay approximately $40,000 a year. (VERY EXITED)

In order to go to such a good school (Private) I had to take out many, many dollars in student debt.

Approximately $40,000 is in my name. The average interest rate is 4%

My mother, while poor was able to help me out and take out the additional $60,000 in a parent plus loan. The average interest rate is around 7%

My mother will not pay any of this. This is my responsibility.

-----

Now the issue. 

On the surface, I can follow much of the advise given and live frugal and pay off these student loans very quickly (4-5 years). Not only would I save money in interest but I will have relieved this burden. I have been poor most of my life, so this is not an issue.. 

However, I do not want to be poor any longer. My other options are as follows.
I pay off my loan (in my name) quickly... or take my time AND use that money to start saving so I can eventually invest...

I allow the loan in my moms name to either
a. Go a full 25 years and be forgiven. (I will be making these payments so that her credit is not affected)
b. I make payments on a 10 year plan hoping that interest rates go down.

The issue is income. I would love to use the money I make to start investing and helping out my family, now.
Or start saving for my family now.
One of the great things I've learned from this sub is that by saving early, in the long run you're better off. 

In the end is do I save or do I sacrifice.
Right now savings interest rates are low so it would be better off paying (my) debt off quicker. However maybe the parent plus loan rate will go down..

personalfinance,"So many ""smart"" people are wrong about interest","I have spent some time on the PF subreddit and I have noticed that quite a few people are just a little too smart for their own good when it comes to interest rates.  What works in business and banking does not necessarily apply to your personal life.  What I am specifically referring to is the idea that it is always ok to go into any amount of debt, just as long as you can make more with your investments.

This includes justifications like, ""Why should I pay off my car loan if it is only 1%"" and ""Don't pay down the loan on your house because you should be investing that money."" or ""Why not borrow if it is 0% interest""  This is how banks work.  They borrow money at a low rate and loan it at a high rate.  You are not a bank.

First of all, banks generally have a very high spread.  They are borrowing at 0.1% and loaning at 5-12% plus.  Second of all, banks diversify their risk over a large portfolio of deposits and loans.  If someone loses their job and stops paying their mortgage or car loan, it will be just a drop in the bucket for the bank (and they'll get those assets too).  You are just one person.  One person that could lose their job at any moment or who could be stuck in a down market with your investments (i.e. the last 5 years).

When ""smart"" people, even financial professionals make interest rate comparisons, many times they are not calculating risk.  That includes the risk of the investment that is supposedly returning a higher rate as well as the additional risk of losing very important things like your home or car.  If you miss too many payments on your home, you will lose it.  If you miss too many payments on your car, you will lose it.  If you lose your car, you might lose your job.

If you really do that math, you will find that your interest rate schemes aren't really making you much money ESPECIALLY if you take into account the interest you would have earned had you just saved up cash to buy that nice car/boat/motorcycle or whatever and DEFINITELY not if you take into account your risk.

tl;dr Don't gamble with interest rates unless you can afford to lose everything for which you have a loan.",finance,1405323019
personalfinance,"Bad shape, or some light at the end of the tunnel? Help, PF Reddit!","I'm in my late twenties, married with two kids. I made a lot of poor financial choices over the last decade (before I was married).


EDIT: Sorry for the long read. Skip to the blue text breakdown below near the bottom. Any advice would be much appreciated.


Since I was 18, I never did quite handle the credit cards very well. My financial demise began with your everyday starter Capital One. The next thing I know I'm packing some other Visas, Mastercards and a handful of department store cards. It came to a point my wallet looked like it was doped up on steroids. Slowly but surely I went from making my payments on time to picking and choosing which ones I could. 


To be fair to myself, I did run into some bad luck in 2009-2010 with my previous employer consistently not paying me on time. It was a 9-5 entry level job, $24k/year. It got so bad one time they were almost 3 periods behind in payroll. This was with me having full rent/utility responsibilities, a car payment, a student loan and all those shiny looking credit cards. Snowball effect ensues. 


Looking back now, boy was I naive to stick around out of some combination of loyalty and job security (hah). While I was far from the most disciplined with money, I like to think I would have been much better about my situation without the added reoccurring payroll issues. This actually happened again 7 months in with my very next employer too, where I worked as an independent contractor. Not again..


Eventually a handful of my credit cards went to collections. My student loan defaulted. Queue the infinite amount of phone calls from 1-800 numbers. I did manage to get my car paid off, so I have that going for me, which is nice.


Fast forward to a couple years ago. I'm married. Under my wife's name, we end up getting a few new credit cards for honeymoon expenses, furniture and a new computer (needed it for work). While by this time we had a fairly steady income between us both, I can admit old habits kicked in and I 'well intently' influenced charging beyond our means. I obviously still had a lot to learn with financial discipline but at least this time around I was making timely payments with a mentality to get rid of our debt sooner rather than later. We did run into a financial funk for a moment there, where we prioritized everything else but her student loan. We tried working with them, but their demands are ridiculous. Sorry, we do not have $42,000+ laying around to settle with you in full, Sallie. What's that Sallie? Three payments of $12,000? I'll write you a check, but good luck cashing it in.


Sometime after, early last year my wife is pregnant. We decide it is best for her to quit her job as we find out we're expecting two for the price of one (best deal ever). During this time I got a better paying job at $50K/year and I settle all the credit card debt that was haunting me all those years. Small victory.


So here's where we're at, PF Reddit. We no longer use the credit cards we have, only paying them off. My wife and I have committed to saving by no longer eating out and watching our budget much more closely. I'm the sole breadwinner here, working from home averaging $50K/year like I was making at my most recent office job, some months are better than others in terms of cash flow.

I've been part of this Dogecoin community since early January and I have to say the people here constantly amaze me. For me Dogecoin and this community is the future of cryptocurrency and I'm speaking as a long time Bitcoiner. Over a month ago [I explained in a previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/26zclx/my_thoughts_on_the_dogecoin_price_as_a_bitcoin/) why I believe Dogecoin price will rise again and [correctly predicted Bitcoin to rise substantially shortly after my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1onfz7/why_i_believe_bitcoin_price_will_reach_300_very/) against in the face of several counter arguments late last year. My thoughts have not changed on Dogecoin but I feel it's worth giving my experience on cryptocurrencies as a Bitcoiner in the early days of 2010-13 and how that compares with Dogecoin.


I bought Bitcoin and Litecoin in the early days and I can tell you the Bitcoin community back then was hopeful, cheerful and very welcoming...forgive us right now we are at the fighting stage with the established status quo wants to knock Bitcoin down. 

In the early days we were only known for CPU/GPU mining discussions and tipping one another after each comment. In fact Bitcoin was only ever used to tip and trade but not to buy anything since we didn't have anything available for Bitcoin. We were very brave I mean wiring money to a company in Japan and getting these online things called Bitcoin which doesn't buy anything?! 

Back then Bitcoin fans were seen as weird and Bitcoin as a complete joke we were idealist and we still are. Many of the people that fought us then were actually the libertarian precious metals community and because gold and silver were tangible and has been money for 5000 years Bitcoin wasn't and was barely a year old. It's hard to argue with them, after all some guy that called himself Satoshi Nakamoto, the Japanese equivalent of Jack Smith, created it but left after a year and no one saw how he looks like. 

We could understand their concerns, a lot of early Bitcoiners like me also have gold and silver in the belief it will protect our wealth from the next financial collapse. But Bitcoin was created for this purpose too, no more will the 1% have economic power over the 99%, ""1 CPU - 1 vote"" said Satoshi in his white paper. We are also in the digital era and with all the success the internet is nowadays there still was no internet currency without the excessive charges of credit card companies. 

Bitcoin changed all that it wasn't just an internet currency it was hoping to be money on every platform in every country, person to person, in at least 10 minutes between any country in any amount for free! Fast forward to present day and we are starting to see that.

Of course we have had many setbacks on the way, such as exchanges being hacked, wallets stolen. We weren't so security conscious back then and we learned the hard way. 

Then we grew in price and popularity and quite recently the government fought us when our dark market Silk Road was shut down by the Feds. We have had 4 price bubbles a lot of sleepless nights I've personally ploughed in [tens of thousands of dollars] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ozhjl/wired_30000_to_btcecom_from_uk_to_their_czech/) lost *a lot* of Bitcoins on the way (and also lost 15000 Litecoins) and forced to read articles with declarations of ""Bitcoin is dead"" after each major price drop.

Sound familiar?

*""History doesn't repeat it self but it does rhyme"" Mark Twain*

That's all part of the growing pains of a disruptive idea.

Dogecoin, by comparison, has a whole economy after just 7 months of inception! It's remarkable as I am also a big Litecoin fan and even that community isn't as productive as this. People talk about Dogecoin's PR as it being behind its popularity but I honestly believe there is no intentional PR, I mean where is the PR team? 

I believe it was a combination of a friendly meme encouraging positive kind people, a internet currency that's easily explainable to anyone, a very mineable coin using your PC/laptop so everyone can get involved in and great online platform such as Reddit to connect like minded users together and everything just snowballed from there.

Now Dogecoin is one of the most productive coins out there with several client and core devs, hundreds of retailers, apps, doge specific websites, blogs and charity fundraisers. That's why I believe Dogecoin is undervalued right now.

*This doesn't mean you should put your life savings into Dogecoin or other cryptocurrencies as they are still a risk and early stage technology. Just buy with what you can afford to lose!*


**So where is Dogecoin heading? - The analysis**

As long as we still use doge for goods and services and keep the positivity going then I can only see the price of doge going higher and reaching all time highs without the need for manipulation. Over what time frame? 

Like Bitcoin it won't be overnight and granted there's no supply limit so it will never reach tens or hundreds of dollars but we don't need it to. I honestly want Dogecoin to be a currency and I personally like having whole doges. Ideally I would hope that 1 or even 10 doge will buy 1 loaf of bread or 1 litre of milk at my local grocery store some day.


**Supply vs Demand**

As I mentioned before the supply coming to the exchanges from multipools has been immense - it is thought about 160 million doge a day is being mined and sold on exchanges just from miners. This not only exerts a lot of selling pressure but it also encourages weak hands to sell forcing the price down further it's a downward spiral which we have been seeing. 

Any other coin would have collapsed long ago but doge is no ordinary coin. After the next two halvings in October time it will be down to 40 million a day and low enough to allow for natural demand to outpace the supply causing the price to increase steadily which will give momentum and may then lead to a new all time high and the second bubble.


**Network Hashrate**

I'm of the belief that ASICs are a necessary evolution in cryptocurrencies by making a coin secure which will attract investment/adoption and environmentally friendly. With scrypt ASICs large and small coming online the network hashrate has more than doubled in the last 2 months from 40 GH/s to 90 GH/s and while we tend to see a jump in hashrate just before a halvening I attribute this rise to small miners also buying ASICs and a lack of more profitable altcoins. Again that's great for the stability of our coin and this will provide further confidence that Dogecoin is a good crypto to buy/adopt/invest.


**Deflationary Inflation**

Sounds confusing so let me explain unlike Bitcoin where there will only be 21 million coins mined, Dogecoin will reach 100 billion coins mined after block 600k and then see 5.25 billion coins mined each year forever which works out as 5.25% inflation in the first year and then 4.99% in the second year and so on. 

While this may seem a lot I have come to the conclusion that it may be a blessing for Dogecoin as it is thought that 5 billion coins per year would be lost permanently anyway so this will 5.25billion coins would replace the lost coins. The extra 5.25 billion coins per year would be enough to incentivise miners to continue mining doge (which would hopefully be at a high enough price after the 600k block reward) and securing our network. 

Because Bitcoin has a cap it is seen as a store of value like gold whereas Dogecoin has a infinite supply but at a predictably low yearly increase in fact from 2015 to 2020 Dogecoin will have less yearly inflation than Bitcoin. This can actually encourage people to treat Dogecoin as a true currency to buy everyday items with than as a store of value. I believe that is what Satoshi envisioned Bitcoin to be.


**What are the whales doing?**

The top [20 dogecoin addresses](http://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-dogecoin-addresses.html) which account for 40% of all mined Dogecoin out there haven't sold any of their DOGEs.
 
The whales with large wallets have not sold their DOGE over the course of the last 4 months but the smaller wallets have! Why? The whales are happy to see their DOGE go to zero if they thought it was dying or they have been there and done that and know that perhaps Dogecoin is heading up? I can tell you I have no intention of selling my DOGEs as I believe interesting times are ahead.


**The Bitcoin Effect** 

Bitcoin has paved the way for a crypto to go from $0.0001 to $1000+ and brought technological development, liberty and a sense of community all in a 5 year timespan. 

While only $0.00023 Dogecoin has got an ecosystem, a following, funded several charity efforts and a burgeoning economy after only 7 months thanks in part to the network effect of Bitcoin and the rest down to you.

All I can say to you all is well done to all of you for being such a positive and productive community. Keep using Dogecoin and check the links at the side bar such as dogedoor.net and suchlist.com so that you can spend, buy, tip and mine doge and spread the word.

Now let's go to the moon!

**TL;DR** - Bitcoin had it's ups and downs and not short of haters over the years. Dogecoin is following the same path but in a shorter time frame. After the next 2 halvings Dogecoin price should be rising and adoption will speed up again which will make it a true currency so keep buying using and tipping doge wherever you can.

___

It's 8:09AM EST and we've found 87.24% of our initial 100 Billion DOGEs -- only 12.76% remains until our period of Hyper-inflation ends!  Our Global Hashrate is up from ~76 to ~92 Gigahashes per second and our Difficulty is up from ~1196 to ~1351.

personalfinance,Putting emergency fund into mortgage offset (AU)?,"Australian based, so sorry if this doesn't translate well.

I am refinancing my place to an interest only mortgage with offset account (done to free up equity so I can move out and keep current place as an investment, likely within the next 5 yrs)

The place is valued at nearly $650k
Loan amount $575k
Amount that will be sitting in offset $275k
So amount left owing on the place is $300k.
Variable interest rate, currently 5.1%

I have a small emergency fund, currently sitting at $8k, which prior to refinancing was in an account netting 2.75 (normally) to 3.25% (bonus interest).

Would it be a good idea to put the emergency fund money in the offset account and bring down my interest payments further (should save ~$500 pa), or leave it in a separate account (earning lower interest- around $250)?

I should accrue about $19,000 in debt to complete the program (strictly for cost of hours, not living, food, etc)

For a total of about $53,000


I went to ubury me and put in my interest rate, balance and a payment of $300 I was told I wouldn't pay it off till 2043. This of course is assuming I cannot pay more per month (ideally I would get a higher paying job of around $50,000 +) This seems to be very depressing. To think that for the next ~ 29 years I will pay $300 a month, every month. 

In addition, come September I will have worked in a non-profit for 3 years. I know that if you make 120 on time payments (10 years) in a 501c3 your remaining debt is forgiven (and you are taxed on it) my question is should I pay $300 a month, or, knowing I will ""likely"" be in a 501c3 for 7 more years, simply pay the IBR of about $30 a month till I complete the 120 on time payments.",finance,1405344721

As I worked and went to school both full time, things eventually got very stressful as most people find. My downfall was that I excelled at the job I was in at the time, and earned two promotions and significant raises in the first year alone. It also meant that my responsibilities and work stress kept increasing and increasing.

Then the economy starts to really torn downward...

Work stress goes through the roof. I'm part of the newest and only profitable branch of the company. Pressure to exceed projections is incredibly high, and finally I end up dropping out of school after making it a whole year with a 4.0 GPA in my courseload.

I never got the chance to go back. Here I am six years later, having left that company finally in 2012 after developing health problems from the stress. I never got the degree. I never got the job that would've let me pay it all off..

Now I'm really struggling. I'm under-employed despite job searching constantly. I've had a handful of really promising, nearly-landed jobs that just didn't pan out. I make $150 a week and live off the charity of family.

This loan started out at $8000.00 and has grown to $10,100+ despite me making payments on it for years while I was working a better paying job. The interest rate is simply through the roof, and I don't have the credit to get it refinanced or bought off by another more reasonable company.

The worst part is, after making the wages I do now, I've been completely unable to make payments and it's now gone to collections. I've been notified that if I don't pay the full amount they will continue pursuing legal debt collection actions against me.

personalfinance,Should I go for a car loan or just buy a cheaper one with cash?,"An overview of my finances:

Age: 28. Family of 3: me, wifey and mom. No Kids.

Income: $6000/month after taxes.

Monthly expenses including rent: $2800

Student Loans: $48000

Very low interest ranging from 2.75% to 4.75%

Total Payments: $350/month

No other loans or credit card debt.

Cash in hand: $7000 

Couple thousand in retirement accounts which I dont want to touch. Also have a 401k.


I have been using a lot of what I make to pay off my loans and debts. Basically I bought down my student loans from $75000 to $48000, paying off all the high interest loans. 

Credit card limit: $20000

Credit Score: About 680-690 depending on who you ask (my bank vs credit karma vs credit sesame)

About two months ago I applied to Capital one bank for a car loan and they approved me for $30000 with a 14% interest rate. Fuck that!

So theoretically I can afford my dream car, a nice $45000 Mercedes SLK 230. Well, its good to dream.

Realistically though, I have a few things to consider.

My wife is going back to college soon, either this fall or in Jan. Student loans are not an option so I will have to end up paying everything for her, either by cash or by credit card. We haven't picked a college yet so I dont know how much it will cost. 

I want to buy a house soon, which is why I need my credit to be as good as it can get. 

For my car loan, I want to shop around. On the same day within 1-2 hours, I was thinking I could apply to 7-8 loan companies and banks and see what best offer I can get. However, the problem with that is that it can hurt my credit, which is bad for when I need to take a home loan. I don't want to be in a situation where trying to save 1% on a 3-5 car loan will result in a 0.5% or a 1% higher rate in a mortgage loan which could cost me thousands more over time.

of course, even if I don't shop around, simply having a car loan in addition to my usual loans will result in me getting a higher mortgage rate. 

So basically my options are:

1) Buy a $7000 car using cash.

2) Buy a car for up to $17000 using cash and credit cards. Then pay off credit cards ASAP. Should be in about 2 months max, unless I have to pay for my wife's college fees....

3) Apply for a car loan without shopping around. Pay minimum down payment since I'll need the money for my wife's college for which I cannot take a loan.

4) Same as 3 except shop around for a car loan instead of just applying to one place.

Problem with 3 and 4 is that it could affect my home buying plan. I dont want to end up with a higher mortgage rate because of my car loan.

I have a feeling that a lot of people who make these claims really have no idea how the fed operates, and that they picture a bunch of fat cats with cigars laughing about how much money they are making. This isn't the case.

There may be problems with the fed, but bitcoin is NOT a solve-all like so many think it is. The macroeconomy is a complex beast that we don't have any for sure answer about. There are many theories and models, but there are too many variables to get anything concrete enough to consistently predict the future state of the economy.

 Bitcoin is great, for many many things, but most any economist will tell you that the actions of the fed have helped to keep the economy stable in the past. YES the fed's actions have on some occasions caused trouble due to miscalculations, but the idea that eliminating monetary control will solve economic problems is absurd.

However, we know that several western investors are, in fact, doing this. We just don’t know how they are getting around the control regime.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Legislation Potentially Disastrous for Growing Canadian Tech Sector,"**Bitcoin Legislation Potentially Disastrous for Growing Canadian Tech Sector**

Concerns continue to mount in the cryptocurrency sector over the Harper Government’s approach to Bitcoin. Bill C-31 contains many potential implications to crypocurrency users, spread throughout various acts in dense legislation. While in spirit most of these developments were expected and not troubling for the international industry, the ambiguity of these rules has generated disastrous results for Canadian end users.

**New rules could cause deluge of foreign registrations with FINTRAC** 

Under Bill C-31 and new money laundering rules, in order for a Canadian to sell any cryptocurrency to someone across borders, both parties could be required to register with FINTRAC as a money services business first. Not only will this most likely create a bottleneck of services at FINTRAC, it will discourage current and potential users from working with the Canadian sector. 

Chris Salsman, President of The WhiteCoin Foundation, believes this could stifle Canada’s participation in a growing international industry.

“This is an eight billion dollar and growing business, and I fear we could see a migration offshore. Vault of Satoshi is a widely respected Ontario based bitcoin exchange, but why would any international user do business with them if they could be forced to jump through lengthy bureaucratic hoops? This demonstrates a completely backwards and dismissive approach to crypto by the Canadian Government. Vault of Satoshi is registered with FINTRAC and requires users to identify themselves fully to conduct transactions, and that should be enough.”   

**Canadian Bitcoin Related Bank Accounts Frozen** 

Dozens of Canadians have had their accounts frozen by nervous banks uncertain of what demonstrates a suspicious cryptocurrency transaction.  Under these rules banks are not permitted to have relationships with ‘unregistered money service businesses’, which could potentially be interpreted as any Canadian who sells a cryptocoin and then tries to deposit the proceeds into a bank account without first being registered. There is total ambiguity as to if they will apply only to exchanges, or include bitcoin miners, buyers, or even just someone who accepts payment for service in bitcoin. Mr. Salsman understands why banks are concerned.

“Until there is clarification as to what a ‘dealer in virtual currencies’ is, banks are naturally responding this way out of fear of being found non-compliant, and the end result is many Canadians having their bank accounts unfairly frozen.” 

**Bill C-31 Could Impede Canada’s entry to $8 billion &amp; growing sector**

The international bitcoin and cryptocurrency sector continues to grow. Mr. Salsman believes the real threat here is to the Canadian technology sector.

“I’ve met many industry innovators from across this country, all of whom believe cryptocurrency represents an amazing opportunity for a struggling Canadian tech sector. A Bitcoin or WhiteCoin is really just an encrypted proof of work chit, which means its potential applications go far beyond just payment transfer. A cryptocurrency technology based password protection service was recently launched; while this business would present no vehicle for money laundering, they too could be considered ‘dealers in virtual currencies’. Why would this industry choose Canada as a place to do business if that’s the case?” 

**Lack of consultation with industry breeds distrust**

Despite the Federal Ministry of Finance claiming to be open for comment for months, there has been no understood outreach. This lack of communication with the industry and its users is troubling to say the least, but Mr. Salsman is hopeful it can still turn around. 

“Money laundering is a serious concern, and we’d be more than happy to work with Canadian Legislators to help create laws that address it while fostering the growth of this innovative sector.”

I'm not sure if adding some personal details is helpful, but I'm 28 (husband is 33), we make approximately 130-135K a year combined, before taxes, and we have significant student loan debt (in the range of just under 200k, together) at differing interest rates (some as low as 1%, some government-sponsored loans at 8.5%, but thats beside the point...).  We do each have a bit of credit card debt, but we plan on having that paid off by November (and likely before then, as we both have been making good progress).  We have about 8k in savings, own a reasonably-priced home, and basically want our debts cleared ASAP.  I should mention that I am currently not contributing to a 401K (though my husband is) other than a defined benefit plan at my job.  I am an attorney (hence the debt) &amp; my husband is a financial analyst, with plans to become a CPA soon (he just needs to take the tests).  We both have excellent credit (high 700s-low 800s) and have never been late on any bill or loan payment. 

At this point, I look to some of the bad decisions I've made in the past (i.e. going to law school, taking out a lot of student loans, etc.) and it totally bums me out, but dwelling on things I did in the past is not helpful save for learning to not do it again.  I am fully accountable for my spending &amp; debts and we are both trying to make the wisest financial plan for our future.

I have used mint for about 2-3 years now, but it doesn't have a lot of the features I'd like (e.g. realtime tracking of where your money is going) and seems really buggy a lot of the time.  I attempted to log every transaction I had been making in an excel spreadsheet, but this seems time-consuming and is tough to get two people with multiple (sometimes separate) accounts to do religiously.

I am looking for a program that will accurately track all of our spending across categories, allow us to create a flexible but realistic budget, and ultimately help us pay down debt/accumulate some savings.

Any recommendations for software, or any general financial advice is very much appreciated.",finance,1405370853

investing,Bond funds,"Hi guys,

I bought a shitty investment fund through my retail bank a while back (huge fees but its all in an isa), I'm looking to transfer to a new ISA account and in addition max out this years allowance in some nice low fee funds and index trackers. I've been dabbling in the equity market for a bit now and am fairly confident with picking a nice isa portion, but I want to make my isa account fairly conservative in allocation, and am looking to get a good bond allocation when I reallocate after transferring in the cash.

Two questions then, both centering around the concept that interest rates are so low:

1. Is it even right to consider a reasonable bond allocation, I'm picking heavily on value on the equity side, and would a portfolio aligned mostly to high income stocks and value picks beat out (and in effect represent less risk) than a bond allocation with the current market conditions?

2. If I am to pick a bond fund I'm erring on the side of shorter term focused funds, and inflation linked bond funds. I've only really started looking into the fixed income market, but would that be a good call based on current interest rates?

Apologies if there's a good sticky on the bond market, all the general advice I see is equities or deals with the bond market as a single entity",finance,1405374860
personalfinance,20 y/o looking for the potential investment ideas and what to do with my savings.,"Personal background:

I'm was born in Brazil and moved to the U.S. when I turned 12 but I digress.

At the age of 16, I began saving the majority of the money I received.
That is when I told my mother that I wanted all of the child support money my father gave (He is Brazilian and paid in Real, which wasn't much). So she said yes and opened up my first Brazilian bank account.

Since then, I have about R$10,000 which is equivalent to $4,500. That money is still in Brazil and I get 6% annual interest rate but that ins't enough to beat inflation.

Fast-forward to the U.S. and I just finished my first year of college and I'm doing BA-Finance at UMASS but i digress again.

My mother and I have made an oral agreement that we will both save for my future. We recently started and I know we don't have much but I still dream about a big future and I know this is just the beginning.

So far we have $3,500 and we are continuing to save. For now, I can save around $300 a week while my mother is saving $200. I can only save this much during the Summer (as I get older, I'll be able to get a better paying job or internship and I will be saving more)  but my mother will continue until I finish with college. 

The point is, that from July 2014 - July 2017 we will be able to save around $30,000 at this rate.

That whole spheal was not the reason why I wanted to do this, but I have recently opened a Fidelity account and put the $3,500 my mother and I saved and I don't have a strong understanding of all the investments considering I just finished my first year of college and I only took general courses. I've been hearing that I should put my money in ETFs and Mutual Funds but I also wanted to hear the perspectives and ideas of others. I plan to take all the money that will be saved and continue to deposit in my Fidelity account but I still need more advice before I blindly buy what I should not have.

I would appreciate to hear some ideas and place that I could learn about.

personalfinance,"25, freelancer, low-income but high savings - Review my finances?","Hey all,

Lurking on this subreddit has become kind of an unhealthy obsession for me, so I figure I'd try and get direct input rather than look for answers in threads started by other people in somewhat similar situations.

**Basics**

I'm 26, male and single. I live on the East Coast. I work as a freelancer. Right now my income stream is pretty steady. I'll usually pull in $3,000 - $4,000/month before taxes but want to say closer to $3,000. 

For 2014, my conservative estimated income before taxes is $38,000. After taxes (I'm probably overestimating, but like to be conservative), it's $26,600.

When I was a kid, I was in a really nasty car accident (hit by a drunk driver). I ended up getting $150k from an insurance payout that my mother invested on my behalf (not super well, but I took the money out and reinvested it elsewhere last year--more on that below). 

**Expenses**

$400 in rent/mo (including utilities). $250 in food/mo. $101/mo for health insurance. $50/mo. for smartphone. Then there's misc. expenses like transit and recreational stuff. I'll usually try and sock away between $500 and $1,000 for savings a month.

**Debt**

Nada, but I have my mother who was laid off a few years ago who I will need to support down the line. She lives really frugally and off of her savings right now, which aren't much.

**Savings/Short Term Money**

* $33,000 in Barclays 0.9% APY

**Taxable Accounts: $280,400**

* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares: $125,000
* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares: $105,000
* PenFed 3 Year CDs @ 2.02% APY: $40,400
* iBond @ 1.58% APY: $10,000

^ I know that the iBond is tax deferred, but it isn't retirement so I just stuck it in there. 

**Retirement Accounts: $33,200**

* ROTH Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF: $11,900
* ROTH individual 401k | Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares: $21,300

**Additional Details:**

I reinvested/moved everything in the fall of last year. So I (think?) until the fall of 2014, if I decide to take anything out from the taxable accounts, I'll have to pay short term capital gains on it.

My plan is to max out my Roth ($5,500 annual limit) and Roth i401k ($17,500 limit + employer's (me!) contribution which might be $6k?) every year to drain the funds from taxable to nontaxable. Of course I don't want to overdo it since I have my mother to think about, plus I don't have a high salary.

I'm looking for feedback and advice since I really don't have anyone to turn to IRL to give me a reality check. I sometimes stress a lot about money. I don't trust Mint so I keep meticulously maintained excel sheets on my computer to log every purchase I make. That's why I have a lot in my Barclays account--I'm just an anxious person, worry about the future (and my mother), and even though I have those above assets, I feel poor because of my income (although I love the freedom and mobility of freelancing). Am I on the right track? Thoughts?",finance,1405377934
personalfinance,I might be screwed for school. Please help,"Hey guys, I'm posting this because I'm desperate and in need of some legitimate advice. I am a community college graduate and I just got accepted to the school of my dreams. I received two scholarships that cover a little over half of my tuition. I was also offered federal loans that cover a bit more, however my school offered 23k in Parent PLUS loans. My father who had decent credit just passed away and my mom who has very poor credit and just lost her job herself. Seeing as how my mom would get denied for the loans I tried to go through the credit union myself to take it out. I only got a credit card this year and I was denied the loan due to not having long standing credit and the only way to get the loan is through a credit worthy cosigner. Problem is, I dont have one. I have 2 years of school left and it seems up in the air because I cannot seem to take out this loan. Financial aid offered me 4k more in a stafford loan but obviously that isnt going to cover the tuition bill that will be left. I feel so stuck and desperate. I graduated with honors and went the community college route to lessen my school debt which I do not regret whatsoever and now the next part of my journey has this huge hurdle over it. I could really use some advice. I basically have 3 weeks until the tuition bill comes due and the only reason I didn't anticipate this was because i thought this would all be in federal loans under my name, I didn't anticipate a parent PLUS loan.

personalfinance,Quick Home Refinance Question,"I think I have my numbers correctly but want to make sure I covered everything.

I've an opportunity to refi my FHA home loan from 3 years ago in to the same rate to a conventional loan.  My main goal is to remove PMI (roughly $150 a month) and to pay off the State downpayment program (around $5k).

Here's current:
$170,000 loan / $161,000 left.
4.25% interest rate

If I refinance, the closing costs will be roughly $3k at the same rate.  But with about $5k higher balance than now since the silent second payoff will be paid off using this refi.  

Paying $150 a month over the next 24+ month in PMI is still more than than $3k in closing costs so that's a small pro but I'd be out of FHA in to a conventional loan and I'd also not have to worry about paying the state back a lump sum of cash if I ever sell or refinance again.

personalfinance,Employer owes me money. What can I do? (x-post from /r/legaladvice,"**Background:**


Up until the end of May I was working at a bar in Massachusetts. When I began, I was told that I would earn a percentage of the total tips and an hourly wage. However, I found out quickly that, although the tip money was divvied up at the end of each night, I would have to ask for (see: pester my managers several times about) a check for my hourly wage. I received my first paycheck 4 months after I began, paid in full for all of the hours I had worked up until that point. Maybe I was a bit naïve for letting this slide, thinking ""oh, this must be how they do it in this industry"".


In May I moved halfway across the country for the summer (for family reasons; location unimportant). I was supposed to receive my second paycheck before moving (2+ months ago at this point), but for one reason or another I did not. Here is a timeline to help lay things out.


**Timeline:**

10/??/2013 - began work

2/??/2014 - received first paycheck

5/?? - request second paycheck

5/9 - was told verbally by GM paycheck check will be ready Monday

5/12 - paycheck not ready

5/23 - last day of work; still no check; manager tells me verbally that the GM says he'll overnight it when it's ready

5/24 - leave for summer destination

5/25 - text GM my summer address

6/4- ask via text if check is sent; GM says he sent it that day

6/14 - still no check; I inquire via text how it was sent; no response

6/27 - get a text from GM saying he had mixed up the addresses (switched mailing and return) on the envelope; says he's on his way to fix it

7/5 - I inquire via text if check was sent; GM responds yes he sent it

7/8 - still no check; inquire via text about mailing date and method; no response

7/13 - call GM, leave voicemail; no response



That brings us to today, 2+ months after I first requested my paycheck, with no sign of the money. What are my options? (I estimate the check will be *at least* $500, probably more.) All of my hours are (were) logged in the computer system at work; however, to my knowledge, I still have my clock in/out sheets for each night I worked, but I did not bring them with me during the move.

TL;DR my employer owes me $500+ in wages; I was supposed to receive a check 2 months ago, have since moved (temporarily) several states away, and have been told several times that it has been sent, but still no check.


Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: formatting and clarifications

UPDATE: I (finally) received the money yesterday. Thankfully, I did not have to pursue any legal help. I contacted the owner of the bar, briefed him on the situation; he said it was the first he'd heard of it, and that he'd look into it. After not hearing from my GM in 10 days, he sent me a picture of the deposit slip, and the money is now in my account. I'm guessing (hoping) the owner reamed the GM a new one, but in all honesty, I'm just glad I finally got paid.",finance,1405385269

personalfinance,Student Loan Default - Rehabilate/Consolidate?,"I recently made a pretty big mistake and defaulted on my one of my  student loans.  I called my servicer's Guaranty to set up a payment plan with the Loan Rehabilitation program. 

1)If the Federal Limit is 18.5% limit on collection fees how did they charge 24% up front and then another +14% somewhere (I think that was two months of my new interest rate of 6.8%)?

2) Would a consolidation loan to combine all my loans be a better solution than the full loan rehabilitation? Would it allow me to negotiate down the collection costs more? 

I am wondering this because I started clicking around on the Department of Education's page and noticed that the Loan consolidation section says:

paying of mortgage, currently our income is higher than our expenses, don't expect any change in that regard soon.

My original plan was to pay of my mortagge ASAP and than see how I want to start investin, however after doing some calculations I have concluded that due to current interest rates and tax breaks here (Netherlands), it is more profitable to invest money instead of paying of paying of my mortgage faster if I manage to make at least ~3% a year.

My plan is to keep 20000 EUR as an emergency fund and invest the remaining money for long term (15 years from now or longer), I think I have a reasonable risk tolerance. I hope to gain 8% or more on average. I will probably keep on adding to the investments periodically if our savings keep growing (which I expect).


My plan is an all ETF portfolio, I have chosen for iShares because they are mostly also traded locally (saves some  broker fees).


I was thinking equal parts of:


* iShares Global Corporate Bond UCITS ETF
* iShares Global AAA-AA Government Bond UCITS ETF
* iShares MSCI Emerging markets SmallCap UCITS ETF
* iShares S&amp;P SmallCap 600 UCITS ETF
* iShares STOXX Europe Mid 200 UCITS ETF
* iShares MSCI World UCITS ETF


I have chosen small mid cap because I heard they may be more more profitable than large cap, I assume this means higher risk? Further I tried to spread my risk with geographic spread and part bond/part stock.

I've been looking at a lot of threads here, and I understand the general idea of paying off debt first, however I was wondering if you all could weigh in on my situation.

I am a 21 y/o university student, looking to strengthen my financial position. 

I earn around AUD 22,000 a year from my hospitality job/maths tutoring and $5000 from government welfare. There is a disincentive to earn more than $200 a week (due to NIT welfare scheme that reduces payout as I earn more than 200p/w), but I usually work a bit more, at the cost of my study.

I want to start investing in the stock market (initially in an index fund, but I wouldnt mind making some strategic bets as I learn more about global capital movements in my economics degree), however I am aware of my student loans at $9k a year + 30k for masters when I do that.  I estimate I will have about $80k in student loans. 

This year the government has attached a real interest rate to the loans,  which use to be pegged to CPI. The interest is now pegged to 10y australian bond yield at around 3.9pc. 

The difficulty with making the choice to repay the loan is that it is income contingent - ie I wont pay anything until I earn around $55k a year. There is a cost to not paying it now, (a higher debt in real terms in the future), but there is no benefit in terms of increasing my present cash flow.

What advice do you all have for me? Should I invest, and try to outrace the yield on my loan? Or should I pay back the loan? Or should I, as per consumption smoothing do nothing, realising I am in a period of low income at the moment?",finance,1405427785

It sounds like the United States government owns some of its own debt. Is that Correct?

personalfinance,Freelance? LLC? Advice for going out on your own?,"I've been following this sub for a few years now and it has always been an incredible resource for varying perspectives on some re-occurring financial predicaments that people tend to find themselves in. From my observations, the sub is frequented by folks who come from various financial backgrounds but are mostly coming from being salaried somewhere where they work full time. I'm writing to seek advice about freelancing as a full time gig. Unfortunately the subs that are directed mostly toward this are seldom visited so hopefully you guys don't mind my taping into your vast and varied personal experience resource.

I've been able to find some general good practices guidelines for being a responsible freelancer but haven't found a thorough guide or database of experiences of others that I can read through. Does anyone have any specific recommendations? Books? Blogs? Forums? Does anyone here have any stories, anecdotes or general advice on good habits, good book keeping, etc. Anything to avoid?

My story is below, it may be irrelevant to providing the resources I asked about so feel free to skip the wall of text!

My personal situation is as follows, so any advice would also be greatly appreciated! I recently finished graduate school (2 years ago) to follow the career of my dreams. It gave the the skills, resources, connections and most importantly time to build my portfolio of work. I'm being vague on purpose but I will say that it is art related while also being highly technical and specialized. This left me with huge student loan bills, aprox 100k after undergrad and grad. All federal and all under IBR currently. While my general field is currently very unstable, the sub genre I got into is doing very well. Right after graduating, I started working at one of the top firms that specialize in producing this kind of product. Unfortunately, as all businesses that have a high overhead and who are still recovering from 2008, they have been very cautious with pay. Currently I am earning 40k before taxes. The product I produce on a monthly basis brings in about 100k to the company from their client. I could stay here and in two years maybe be bumped up to 50-55k range but living in a high cost of living area, this doesn't bode well for a sustainable future and for paying off my loans.  Also, due to signing a non-compete, I cannot freelance locally without stumbling on all of my current firms clients and not for two years after I stop working there, not in the next few states over as well. I cannot freelance remotely either because since I am salaried, I end up working 60+ hours a week plus 3 hours commuting and feeling like I'm dead when I do get home. I have a chance now to move to a mid western state to a mid-sized city that has a nice cultural center and a few large cities surrounding it. While the field I work in is also booming there, there is no one there locally who can do what I can do. I got confirmation of this by talking to nearly all the business proprietors who would potentially utilize my work in the immediate area and they are all on board after seeing my portfolio to stop giving work to other firms states away if I can deliver the same product locally. While I would not be able to charge as much as the firms in the big city for the final product, I can earn substantially more than I do now, with conservatively enough work to bring it between 5 and 20k a month.  I have a chance to do all of this while living somewhere rent free with a dedicated office space and with very low cost of living, especially compared to what I am used to. I want to do this right. I want to pay of my loans asap and then work on my own personal net worth. Those in my field usually freelance and rely on 1099s sent to them by the clients to do their taxes and etc. What about becoming an LLC? I rely heavily on technology to get work done and would like the benefit of writing off some of my expenses for example. Any earning threshold I should reach before I explore that option? What are your personal experiences? The community of people who do what I do is EXTREMELY small and we all know one another or at least of one another by first name and since a lot of them work remotely, people get VERY territorial about providing advice on how they do business. I feel like it's extremely difficult to get advice from them when they do feel like sharing.

personalfinance,Prioritize student debt or saving for down payment?,"I have $25k in student debt. One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. 


At the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k. 

Sometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k. 


At the end of the 9 months, should I continue to focus on paying down student debt (which will be a balance of $14k by then) or growing our savings/down payment? I have $5200/mo to somehow split between debt and down payment and I'm not sure how best to allocate it.

I currently have 5k in my bank account and am currently employed making ~150 a week.

Thanks for your help.",finance,1405447448
personalfinance,Looking for advice on student loan refinancing,"For some reason, r/studentloans didn't like my question, so I'll try here.

I am considering refinancing my loans with SoFi, but I'm a little terrified to be messing with debt that has so many protections with a company I can't see in person, and know nothing about.

Here are the important details:

I pay 6.875% on $50k of consolidated federal loans. SoFi is offering me 3.4%-3.5% on variable rates, and 4.5%-5.5% on fixed, depending on a 5 or 10-year repayment plan.

In general, the 10 year plans require $550 a month, the 5-year $920 a month. I currently pay about $720, and could probably afford $920 for a while at least, but would be afraid to commit to it for 5 years. I've got a solid budget and growing e-fund (currently at 4 months) that factors in roughly a $500/month minimum payment on student loans.

I work in government, so pretty secure, well-paying job not too close to appointee whims, but I am not unionized, so it's still ""at-will"". I make too much for the IBR requriements for Public Service Loan Forgiveness; if I was in the program I'd pay off my loans in total before the 10-year mark.

I get paid on a bi-weekly schedule and not bi-monthly, so I intend to dump at least one of my two full extra paychecks into the loans per year. Because of this, it's possbile that I'll be overpaying even a 5-year plan if I can keep up on $900/month.

For these reasons, I'm considering the 3.5% 10-year variable, which gives me the flexibility to not be tied to a 5-year plan, but incentive to pay aggressively. I also don't really have a good sense of what I'm risking, interest-rate wise. Credit is cheap now, but a ~~double~~ triple dip would hurt, bad.

Has anyone used SoFi at all? How do they compare to other private financers? Pros and cons of swapping them for federal debt, besides the above? Do these interest rates make sense for the risk?",finance,1405448154
personalfinance,About to have some extra money every month. Trying to decide how to split it.,"I've got about 2.5 years left in my PhD program and expect to make ~45-60k/year after graduation.  I have 83k in student loans (that's combined private and federal subsidized/unsubsidized) with interest varying from 3%-7.25%.  I'm about to make the final payment on a credit card that I've been paying on for about 4 years and my car is finally paid off.  

So....I'll have about $250 left over every month ($350-400 but I'm figuring to have around $100/mo go to unexpected things so I'm low-balling it).  I don't expect to buy a house after graduation as most people in my position have to do at least 1-2 post docs before settling down so I'm not super focused on saving for a down payment or anything.  I want to start saving but also start paying down some of my student loans before mandatory repayment.  Would it be better to put more of that money into my high interest, unsubsidized student loans and focus more on savings when I have a better paying job in the future?  Split it 50/50?  

EDIT:  Thanks everyone.  This confirms my thoughts of building up my savings first and worrying about the massive pile of debt later.",finance,1405448192
personalfinance,"Student Loans/401k/IRA Question, BF recommended that I talk to you guys!","I'm 26 and recently graduated from grad school with around 60K (avg 5.4% interest rate) in student loan debt. The market's a bit tight but I should be able to get a job making 55-65K within the next couple months. I'm really fortunate that I don't have any other debt and that my parents let me move home after graduation so that I won't have rent payments until I secure a job. 

I know that I took out more than is recommended for my salary prospects, but honestly this career was the right choice for me and I don't regret that. 

I have to start paying back my loans next month ($300/mn (private), increasing to almost $1000/mn in Feb (with federal loans)).

Here's my plan, I would like to sign-up for the extended payment plan (25yrs) on my federal loans in order to decrease the minimum payment due to each loan so that I can then turn around and dump as much extra money as possible towards my worst loan ($37,000 at 6.8%). Is this sensible?

Also, I would like to pay back all my loans ASAP (under 6 yrs) therefore, I'm considering not contributing to a 401k/IRA until I've made a significant dent in my debt (future job is unlikely to offer any matching). I've gotten conflicting advise on this, what do you think?",finance,1405448255
personalfinance,Help needed: Credit card payoff strategy,"* My parents have 14 credit card accounts with about $65K of debt. 


* They don't care about the credit score as they don't expect to buy a home ever again, rent an apartment, get a new job, etc. 


* Looking at their credit reports, I see the status of the accounts: 

3 accounts are charged off ($23K) -- I'm guessing no interest rate applies to these.  The other 11 accounts range from 0% to 25% interest rate: 4 accounts are past due, 5 are closed, 2 are OK.

My questions are:

* If, hypothetically, they came into a $10,000 windfall, where should the money go first? If they had a windfall of more than $65K, they could pay off the entire debt, of course. However, with a windfall smaller than $65K, **do they prioritize the charge off accounts, the high interest rate accounts, or the past due accounts given that they don't care about their credit score?**

personalfinance,What should my next move be for paying off debt.,"I came into a bit of money and want to be wise in paying off the rest of my CC debt. Can you help advise me?

I have a good job and had great credit but I went into a reckless period of my life in my late 20's and burned though massive credit cards and racked up thousands in debt. Yes I know, I made bad choices and I have learned from them. I have no wife or kids and just need to figure out the smart way to use my money to get out of debt.

I have 5 open credit cards of various limits maxed out. I took a loan out against my 401k ($100 a month to pay back is not a big deal when compared to the CC interest) in the past 2 weeks I've paid all my behind bills except my two biggest credit cards (I still have money in the bank but I'm told CC companies will negotiate with you better if you're late on payments and they think you might default on the bill.)

I know I can pay these off at monthly at more than the minimum payment, but I want to do it the smart way.

Out of all my debts here is the situation: I have 5 cards though 2 banks... 

One is full massive commercial bank and they seemed more equipped to handle negotiations, offer deals and work with me. 

The other is bigger credit union and they bounced me around between card services and financial planning with both departments telling me ""we don't do that here."" They just today gave me the number for a debt relief company.

I have 4 accounts though the Bank...

• 1 Massive Credit Card has $9k debt on it - 27% Interest (my thoughts are I need to get the interest lessened as I pay back monthly, or if I really tightened my belt they said they would let the whole thing go for 6k)

• 2nd Massive Credit Card had $5k debt on it - 27-ish% Interest (I did negotiate with them down to 3k to settle the whole thing, which I paid)

• 3rd is active credit card, $3K limit, I am in control of this one and have been smart with paying it and will use it to help rebuild my credit score. 

• 4th account is car loan, I just made the very last payment last month and saw a decrease in my 1st CC's interest go down from 29.99% to 27% which I think it because of the payment. 

Credit union

• 1st Massive Credit Card has $14k debt on it - 15% Interest (my thoughts again are I need to get the interest lessened as I pay back monthly)

• 2nd Card had $2K debt on it, but I just paid the whole thing off last week.

So about 22k in debt and the to me it seems like the interest is the biggest problem, but I could be wrong. 

So I'll have just about $8K in savings at the end of the month. (after living expenses). What is the smartest way to go. Should I contact a debt relief company (I know almost nothing about these things and what they can do and could scam out of me), should I just pay the bills and do my best to pay as much as I can a month. Should I try negotiations with the credit union again? Should I try to get a loan at a low interest rate? Should I take all my savings and play one really big hand of blackjack?

Please advise if you could offer any ways for me to be smart with my money in regards to debt!",finance,1405455229

So, last year I graduated from a top tier college with a degree in Biomedical Engineering; I got a job and am currently salaried at $52,000 with a 20% performance based bonus. I live with my parents so my only real expenses are a car payment/maintenance (I’m on my parent’s insurance for both health and vehicle) and the occasional night out. Note all vehicle expenses gas, oil, maintenance, is paid with a credit card the balance of which I pay off every month (I earn cash back). I have a saving account which I deposit $200 of every paycheck into but the account has a measly 0.01% APR.

Does anyone have any suggestions on strategies for paying off my debt, while setting myself up financially?

personalfinance,Best student loan lender?,"For my first year of college, I got around 10k in private loans from Discover, at their lowest interest rate, since my dad cosigned and has awesome credit. 

For this years loan, I'm trying to secure around 20k (got less financial aid and not using federal loans this year). Needless to say I went back to Discover since we got such a nice deal last year. But now they're asking 6% for a variable loan, almost double what they gave us last year.

I mean, yeah, it's actually not too bad a deal relatively, but their rates start at 2.99% now and Idk what's making us a credit risk all of a sudden. 

This would make sense if my dad was playing fast and loose with his credit, but actually his credit is even *better* than it was last year. He's an old guy with a house, a family, and a bunch of investments. It really doesn't add up. Even without my dad cosigning, my credit for a 19yo is fairly good I'd say. 

I don't know why Discover student loans wants to double my APR, and frankly I don't care. We did have an error with them because my dad accidentally reported his income to them incorrectly, but that was supposedly resolved.

I'm just looking for better alternatives. Any recommendations? Maybe like a website even where you can compare different loans? 

If this isn't the proper forum for this, I'd appreciate a point in the right direction.

I've been a lurker for a while and have finally decided to take responsibility for my poor financial planning.  I've got a fair amount of consumer debt, a small amount of car debt, and a small amount of student debt.  All of which are as follows:

Credit 1 - 	18629	14.99% min. 664
Credit 2 -	1956.64	15.24%  min. 35
Credit 3      2157.96	15.90%  min. 125

Student	6329.43	5.72%   min 130

All of that is remaining debt at their current interest rates with my minimum payments each month.  I've checked out unbury.me and at those current minimums using the avalanche method I would be done paying in April of 2017 with a monthly payment of 1184.00 or so.

Would it make sense to take out a 30,000 personal loan at 13% over the same 2.5 years (the interest rate quoted is actually for a 5 year loan, I think it would be lower for less years)?  I believe at that interest rate over 2.5 years i would have a monthly payment of 1130.00.  A savings of $54 a month and $900 over the 2.5 year period.

Additionally, would it make sense to get a smaller loan just to cover the higher interest items and then keep the car/student loans and pay those off separately?

Thank you vey much for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing what you all think.  I realize I've been irresponsible with these things - I'm trying to change my lifestyle to make this more manageable.

personalfinance,Debt free but broke or big financial safety net but constantly battling interest? (U.S. Federal Student Loans),"Hello, I've seen similar discussions and have been talking about this a lot with trusted friends and loved ones, but I'd would like r/personalfinance's opinion.

I have a student loan balance that's just dropped under $20,000. The original balance wasn't much more than that and I feel that despite my saving skills and keeping on top of every payment, the near 7% interest is kicking my ass (it takes up over a third of my monthly payment). Granted, I've only been paying the loan for 2 years. 

Long story short, I've been working overseas for a year and am about to return to the US, taking back with me enough money to pay my student debt off in full. Only thing is...I'd be flat broke after that, which I've managed to avoid since I started working in high school. Of course I would want to secure a job before taking this step, but the fact is that I probably would have a low salary/wage and would have to live with my parents for quite a while in order to save anything and start over in such an expensive area of the country. 

A couple friends and my family advise me to not pay off in full until a year or more after securing a job or to pay half the outstanding balance and then have about 10K as a safety net while I try to re-start my life stateside. However, my SO and a different set of friends are telling me that I should just pay the entire thing as soon as I get a new job and just start from scratch and that it is doable to make it from there. 

I'm leaning more towards the former opinion, but the second one is tempting as I would like to be debt free and not have to pay such insane interest. Thoughts?",finance,1405510050

I recently got my student loans out of default and over the past few years since I took this loan my credit has gone from around 505 to ~615.

I am thinking of refinancing this loan to get a better interest rate. Last year I paid about $2k in interest alone,  over half of each payment went towards interest. My idea is to refinance somewhere around 5% or lower if I get approved, and keep making my $320/month payment and just pay off the car as fast as possible, I could even go as high as $400 some months. 

I am not very good at calculating interest, but I can only assume this should save me in the long run and allow me to have a car worth more in the long run since the value is diminishing quickly. 

Would this be a good idea? Would it have any negative impact on my credit? My ultimate goal is to pay off the car and sell it for something more practical/family-style since I have a 1 year old.

personalfinance,"$105,000 paid in full!","So from 2008-2012 I was married to a gal who, how shall we say, liked to buy stuff we couldn't afford. She racked up 55k on my credit cards by raiding my safe and ""borrowing"" them. Then she cheated on me, hired an attorney, and I ended up being stuck paying 60k to her in alimony, and ended up with the 55k all stuck in my name.

So here's what I did:

1. I immediately sold everything I had that had any value that wasn't absolute necessity. I used Ebay and Craigslist. I found Craigslist better for common items, and Ebay much more useful for niche' products that don't necessarily have local markets. For example, I had a high end microphone preamp that I sold on Ebay. No one within 200 miles had any interest, but on Ebay it sold in 2 hours. You'll be surprised how much stuff you don't HAVE to own. A lot of things you might use a couple times a year, you can simply borrow from a friend or family.

2. I cancelled every paid subscription I had for everything. Cable, internet, cell phone, silly internet subscriptions. Even the little one dollar a month stuff. It's amazing how fast they add up.

3. No eating out. Ever. Shopped for groceries in bulk, cooked at home. Saved a good $50-100 a week.

4. I attacked the highest interest stuff first. Citicard at 29.99% - buh bye. Worked my way down the list in order of interest rate. I called every single card and asked for a lower rate... begged actually. Almost all of them gave me a break - even if it was just for 6 or 12 months, it was a huge help. DO NOT consolidate or default unless you are just physically unable to make minimum payments.

5. Worked on the side. Everyone is good at something. For me it's photography/videography. I started shooting weddings on the weekends. It was extremely tiring but a great way to add a few hundred a week in credit card payments over what my job could provide. I didn't pay for advertising - I used word of mouth and Craigslist. Not sure what you're good at, but whether it's programming, art, cooking... you can make some extra cash.

6. I didn't buy anything. No new clothes, no new glasses, no beer :(. I didn't even buy stuff at Goodwill. Chances are you don't NEED anything - except possibly soap. Need internet? Libraries are free. Need TV? No you don't... :)

7. I kept my eye on the goal. I kept a spreadsheet with all the balances and interest rates, and I watched the number go down. I probably looked at it every day, but at least every couple of days. Having the goal in front of me was the biggest motivator for me. It is like eating an elephant - just take one bite at a time.

8. Reward yourself with free stuff. Don't give into the temptation to go splurge to celebrate a mini-goal. When you meet the big goal, you can save up for whatever you want... without those CC payments you'll be rolling in cash now that you've learned to live cheap.

No matter how big a mountain you have, you can do it. Don't be a prisoner to debt! 

Now... what the heck am I going to do with all of this available credit? ;)

Edit: Because being helpful is more important than bragging, and because grammar is important.

Edit 2: thanks for the great feedback! And the gold. And for almost all being kind instead of being twats (post by a guy yesterday whose baby died got trolled - made me so mad. You guys rock. Also 55k + 60k is 115k. I'm an idiot.

Edit 3: Damn, guys. This threat had blown up! Couple comments to address the most common questions. First, my wife's spending was about 6 months into the marriage and she racked up all that credit card debt in less than two months. As soon as I looked at the statements I called and put a stop to all the spending (had new cards sent, and changed my address to my work address). Second, there were plenty of red flags about her... my family and friends all hated her from day one, she always insisted on being pampered... I ignored them, because, well, I'm an idiot. Third, in my state, infidelity is not considered in divorces. Alimony is purely determined by who is the sole breadwinner. That was me, because she quit her job right after we married and never worked again. I'm happy to report she is now making minimum wage stocking shelves at Home Depot in Colorado Springs (she moved out of state). Four, I had a beautiful little baby girl with my new lady and we are now married. It all happened really fast and she's amazing (as is the baby). We did NOT get a prenup because I still subscribe to the ""if I can't trust her I shouldn't marry her"" philosophy in spite of myself. My new wife makes almost what I make so that takes a lot of the pressure off. Also, she is completely debt free herself, which is a good sign.",finance,1405527684

I *think* that the property values have raised enough  that an appraisal will  allow us to refinance out of the PMI.  It’s an FHA loan, so we are stuck with PMI until 5 years and 22% equity based on the original loan value. 
Questions:
1)      I know we might be taking a risk with the appraisal, but what’s the best measure I can get on appraisal value before that? I’ve looked at comps (one next door, the others all very close) and the price per square foot measure should put us over the hump.  Is this what the bank will use?
2)      Also, I’d like to shop around, but if I go to a few different companies will that ding my credit score? When I last checked I was 5 points shy of the next category, hoping that goes up this month.  What I’m saying is, a small ding my hurt me here.

personalfinance,Desperately want to move out of state-need assistance trying to figure out the best course of action,"Hello,

My husband and I would like to move from IL to either AZ or GA within the next 2 years. We're tired of the weather and the high cost of living (our property taxes alone are $10k a year) here in IL and want to get to a warmer climate with less expensive housing. 

Combined we bring home $9100 a month, not including bonuses because they vary too much, after health insurance, taxes and 401ks. Sounds great, right? Well, we moved to IL four years ago and bought a home. A home that has turned out to be a complete money pit that we've had to sink over $50k in the past few years into for repairs so our savings has been decimated and I'm currently carrying about $15k in credit card debt at 0% for the next 18 months.

The house is probably worth anywhere from 270-300k depending on who you ask. We currently owe $246k so really, there isn't any equity for us to tap into considering the market is still soft here and in the event that we sell it, realtor commissions and closing costs will eat up what little bit we do have. Our mortgage is a fixed rate at 4.5% APR. 

In the event of a move, we will be relocating for employers so moving expenses would be covered. We both work in a field that there is always demand in so we're not too concerned about being able to find work making at least what we're making now.

What is overwhelming to me is trying to save up money to cover a down payment on a new home (or do we just rent?), money to cover one of us possibly not working for a few months (in the event that one of us scores a new position but the other one has to trail behind without a job to the new city) and money to complete some upgrades/repairs around the house that I believe will need to be done for us to be able to sell the property we own in IL. 

We've made some bad decisions (buying this house, buying expensive cars,etc) but one thing we've always done is max out out 401k contributions at 20%. I refuse to touch that money but now I'm wondering if it makes more sense to lower our contributions down at least for the short term so that we have more cash flow to cover the more immediate concerns. 

Our monthly budget right now:

Income: $9,100

Mortgage: $2399 (going up to $2460 next month as our property taxes have increased AGAIN and we pay them &amp; our insurance to our mortgage co.)

My car: $682 (Currently owe $24k @.9% APR- car is maybe worth that much)

Husband's car: $565 (Currently owe maybe $24k @ .9% APR) Husband's car was totaled in an accident last year and we were forced to replace it- and pay the $3k difference in what was owed vs value so we had an extremely minimal down payment

Credit card debt: $833 per month minimum. Will be paid off in 16 months at this rate at 0% apr- likely will be paid off sooner with bonuses that we receive next year

Tuition for children: $733 We have 1 child in college and 2 attending private school

Groceries: $800 

Student loans- mine- $125

Student loan- husband: $50

Car insurance: $423 (teenaged drivers on our policy)

Gas: $500 

Cell phones: $225

Natural gas/heat: $100

Electric: $150

Water/garbage: $100

Sat TV: $175 (husband has every available sports package which drives this up)

Internet- $50

Clothing- $100

Medical- $500 (glasses, prescriptions, co pays, etc. Our youngest has autism and ADHD so her therapy bills are massive) 

Vacations: $100 

Christmas/Bdays/Weddings: $150

Pets: $75 

Fun: $150 

Savings: $100 (and there's the problem)

Positives:

We rarely eat out- I cook all of our meals 

We have outstanding credit scores that allows us to finance our debt at decent interest rates

Combined we make a decent income 

Healthcare expenses are paid using a HSA so at least it's pretax

Negatives:
Our middle daughter turns 18 this year- not quite sure what that is going to do us income tax wise. We usually get a small ($2k) refund every year- we may end up owing now

Liquid savings less than $5k. 401ks currently have over $500k combined.

Extremely high mortgage and car payments 

Our bonuses are usually anywhere from 5-15k each per year but we do not include them in our monthly budget as they vary so much and we typically just use them to pay down debt that's accumulated over the course of the year.

It's obvious to me that we need to decrease our expenses but I'm not sure where and how? Do we try to refinance our cars back to 60 month loans to decrease the payments? Tell our daughters that they're on their own in terms on college (loathe to do this)? Decrease our 401k contributions (really loathe to do this as well. I have zero confidence that SS will exist by the time we retire in 30 years. Both of our parents are struggling in retirement and we would like to be able to travel and do all of the things that we've put off because of the kids and work). 

By my math, we will need at least $25k saved up to cover a move. So if we want this to happen in two years we'll need to start saving A LOT more than we are now.

Never had an emergency fund, so every thing that breaks on the house or cars gets charged to the credit cards (4,200 just in the last couple months). Otherwise perfect credit, but my credit card utilization is keeping my score down at 704 right now (paying 10000 will boost to 722 according to credit karma). I have at least 140,000 equity (420,000 value with 280,000 loan balance 3.25% + mortgage insurance) in my house and may want to move soon anyways for an extra bedroom. I would also like to not pay mortgage insurance. I am afraid to move because my credit score is currently low due to high credit card usage and a sale/purchase will be affected by that score. Moving seems like it matters here, but I don't know how to consider that in this question that is just about my 30,000 credit card debt.

I can get a 16,000 loan with the click of a button from my 401k at 5.25% which automatically deducts the payments from paychecks to refund the account and pay off the loan. I can choose anywhere from 1-5 years as the payoff period. I would be reluctant to choose any more than 2 years. My current plan is to take the 16,000 401k loan and pay off credit card 1 entirely (its an amex and i have disabled pay over time feature which I never should have activated in the first place). I would use the rest of that to pay off highest interest rate cards next. I would use all my extra income and bonuses along with every extra penny from my monthly income to reduce my debt further by the end of the year. Once all old debts are paid, I would increase the payments to the 401k loan. If in the middle of this, I sell the house, I would immediately pay off all debts and refund my 401k.

Is this a reasonable plan of action or is there some better way for me to refinance these debts and pay them down? Should I choose a longer repayment period on the 401k loan to allow extra money every month to go towards other credit cards? I do understand that I lose out on gains when I take this 401k loan, but I am losing way more to debt interest I think. I also understand that I can not start racking up that debt again, so that is why I have started a budget:

personalfinance,Seeking advice on refinancing my mortgage to eliminate PMI.,"Hi PF,

I'll start off with some details.

* 30 yr/fixed FHA loan at 3.25% APR.
* Original loan amount $542,276.00.
* Current loan balance $525,856.86.
* Maturity date 01-2043.
* 740 + FICO score.
* Home is located in CA.
* Current home value based off zillow.com($650,000)
* Monthly Payment of $3,627.70 breakdown:

Principal | Interest | Tax | Shortage | PMI | Property Insurance | Total

$933.30 | $1,426.72 | $605.49 | $46.10 | $528.09 | $88 | $3,627.70


The terms of my loan state that my PMI will be eliminated once the loan has reached 20% equity and the loan has matured to 5 years. 

All this being said. I'm trying to figure out what makes the most financial sense. The options I have come up with are

1. Increase my monthly payment principal by $1600 to have 20% equity in my loan by 01/01/2018 to eliminate the PMI. 
2. Make one lump sum payment of ~52,000 12/1/2017.
3. Refinance to a 15/yr fixed with a lower interest rate and similar monthly payment?

The third option is the one I have the most questions about. Here is a list of my questions:

1. What additional costs are involved in refinancing your home?
2. I'm assuming refinancing is similar to ""rebuying"" your house. The lender you decide to go with comes out and appraises your property which determines the FMV. Is this FMV what's determined to figure out how much equity is available in your home?
3. If this is the case does that mean with the current loan balance my house would have to appraise at $657,321.08 to have a 20% equity in the home?
4. What is needed to qualify for refinancing, is the any sort of general advice to follow?
5. Am I approaching this problem wrong? Are there other options I should consider?

The truck would be down to only a few payments, but the Jared card interest rate was insane so I refinanced the truck loan adding the needed amount to pay off the Jared card (about $2,000). This brought the payment to $350, and the $145 insurance payment actually includes my wife's car.

Now I'm down to $3,500 left on my truck loan and in a good spot to pay it off this year, but I am now working a new job and dreading the 21ish MPG that the truck gets on a 70 mile round trip daily commute.  I threaten my wife that I am selling that truck and getting a cheaper more fuel efficient vehicle all the time.

What would you do?

Edit: I totally forgot to mention that the main reason I began to entertain the idea of selling this truck was that the A/C went out about 8 months ago. A/C only works on MAX AC and its not as cold as usual, heat works fine. I though to myself ""WTF! I bought new because I was tired of used cars needing repairs. Here I am only about 4 years into this truck and the damned A/C goes out, conveniently for Ford just as my extended warranty runs out.""",finance,1405540141

personalfinance,"Credit unions, where have you BEEN all my life?!","I'm posting to encourage others to go to a credit union and see what they have to offer by sharing my great experience, and also to ask for suggestions, advice, and comments based on what I decided.

My wife and I have a checking account with Large Heartless National Corporation.  We are both teachers, and have finally made our first financial goal: one month's expenses saved!  I took the advice of several Redditors and we went to a credit union to open a savings account.  The short-term goal was to park our one-month's expenses for maximum safety and liquidity.  The long-term goal with a credit union was to position ourselves for repairing our cruddy credit* by applying for a credit card later on, and maybe an auto loan a couple of years out.

Well, we went in and it was the best banking experience of my life.  I decided on a free, no-minimum-balance, no conditions savings account (one for each of us, money evenly divided, and each of them joint).  Then, the associate told us they have a $1,000 per year teacher supply loan with no credit checks, zero percent interest, and it reports to the credit bureaus.  She said it won't help with the utilization ratio right away, but it will show a history of on-time, in-full payments.  So, we got one for each of our accounts, and listed each other as joint on the loans.  It's $100 per month for 10 months at the end of which we can just get another one with no credit check.

That may seem like the opposite of saving money, but we had them put the entire amount into savings, and then had them set up automatic withdraws for the payments!  We're not touching it.

Then, she said they have an overdraft protection feature which operates as a line of credit (no penalty, no interest), and the amount varies.  They report it to the credit bureaus by month as a loaned amount based on percentage, just like a credit card.  So, we each have a $300 overdraft protection now.  If I believe it would be beneficial to my credit, I can go online and transfer any amount (this is where she said utilization percent would come into effect) from my overdraft account into my savings account, and the bank automatically withdraws the monthly payment from my account at $25 per month without me doing anything.  There is a small interest fee on that, but I would have to weight the fee with the good or bad effect on my credit, as this reports as a loan also.

Finally, based on a soft hit on my wife's credit, they offered her a $2,500 card with ~15% interest.  They said they have no problem both reducing the interest rate AND increasing the limit later, with a total of $25,000 allowed per card.  She said they typically do adjustments automatically.  So, we went joint on that card and will be using it ONLY for gasoline for immediate payoff until we figure something else out.

I know that these recently-opened items may cause our credit to take a dip initially, but from everything I've read this will start a good upward swing in our scores in the next couple of years.  In the meantime, we have a month's worth of expenses squirreled away and we're in the middle of a debt snowball as continue with other financial plans (for another post).

personalfinance,Insurance Help- am I stuck with my horrible plan??,"Throwaway so I can add personal info-  
  
My ""husband"" and I moved to NJ a few months ago from overseas for (his) job. I say ""husband"" because we had a wedding, but we aren't legally married for financial reasons- I have about $80,000 in student loans that are on an income-based repayment plan, and I'm not working now, so my payments are at $0. If we were married, the minimum monthly payment would be close to $900/mo, which would make things extremely tight for us. When I get a job and we have a dual income to support payments, I will be avalanching my way to freedom. Except my loans, we have no debt, and we are able to live comfortably and save appropriately on my husband's income.  
  
Really, I'm here to talk about insurance. My husband has a fantastic job that he loves working with a small group of seed capitalists. He has a salary and gets equity in the companies they work with (so maybe one day I'll be back here asking r/personalfinance what to do with our newly netted millions). The group is very small, so they don't have Big Corporate benefits, like health insurance. I applied for health insurance through the Marketplace in February when we moved, and hubby's job reimburses him for my premiums (the hubs himself is covered through insurance from his home country). I chose a middle-of-the-road plan with what seemed like decent coverage and an acceptable deductible ($1500). Amerihealth!  
  
Amerihealth has proven to be an absolute nightmare. First, they double-enrolled me and deducted premiums for a plan I never requested. Took until this week to correct the problem. ENDLESS hours on the phone with their terrible customer support. But that is a resolvable problem. More pressingly, I'm pregnant (huzzah!), and they continue to deny payments for juuust about anything except my doctor's appointments- labs, ultrasounds, genetic testing...they say it's not covered under my prenatal benefits. And I'm having a normal pregnancy, and I'm only doing the bare minimum amount of testing/supervision that my OB/GYN's practice requires.  
  
At this point, I'm convinced that having this baby is going to cost me thousands and thousands of dollars, even if everything goes swimmingly. I am fed up with Amerihealth's horrible coverage and horrible customer service, and I'm looking to switch. I'm due at the beginning of November, so I can't wait for the marketplace to re-open.
So two main questions for all 'yall:  
  
1. Any recommendations for insurance companies offering individual plans with good maternity benefits in NJ?  
2. More pressingly, can get any plan before the Marketplace opens again? Amerihealth says I cannot switch to a higher tier plan until November open enrollment unless I have a major life event. Marriage is out for above reasons, and having a baby won't help with expenses incurred due to having said baby.

We're in this period of time where we have fairly manageable debt and fairly good income but no real plan with how to make our money grow. Also, one thing like a good car accident could derail us. It's scary.

I read some of the rules and FAQ and think it's OK to go for it, so here's some details:

He makes $50k and has his withhold amount set high to try and compensate, but usually we still pay a few thousand in one fat check to the IRS.

House 1: Purchased in 2006 for $225,000, 5% 30yr mortgage, currently worth roughly $140,000. Being rented out for $1380/mo, a monthly loss of $350 on our ""income"" property. (Plus cost of maintenance, repairs, travel time to manage it...stress.)

House 2: Purchased in 2013 for $163,000, 3.375% 30 yr mortgage, currently worth roughly $180,000.

No credit card debt.

No car loan debt.

One student loan, roughly still owing $8,000.

A few hundred always holding in checking to cover groceries and such, and a few thousand in savings as emergency funds. Enough to cover at least two months of bills if we should both somehow lose our employment at the same time.

No employer retirements. We're both 35 years old. Each of us has roughly $4,000 in separate IRAs. (I know little about how this works, aside that I have it. She contributes $100/month now, he is $50/month but started earlier.)

Two kids, elementary-aged. One /r/aww dog and one /r/aww cat.

Aside from that first house situation I feel like we're pretty simple and straightforward, but yet I'm clueless on where to go from here. Our bills are paid, we have some leftover most months (barring the rental deck need replacing or some other such incident) but don't know where to stick it that's any good.

personalfinance,Feeling unsure of how to proceed on student loans.,"Some background:

I recently graduated in May of this year with a master's degree in mechanical engineering.  The day of my graduation I was offered a job with a $60,000 salary and unfortunately ~$100,000 in student loan debt.  

I have begun to plan how to pay this back, while in the 6 month grace period, before my loans begin to kick in come December/January.

The Loans:

The loans are spread out over **16 different loans** ranging from 6.8% interest to 2.35% interest.  These are all stafford loans in various forms with one grad loan.  The total payments due per month on them is currently $1088.53.

Available Funds:

Due to lovely taxes, I only roughly take home ~60% of my paychecks (0 deductions on state, fed, and local).  What I end up taking home biweekly is $1458.44 leading to roughly $2916.88 before any expenses are taken out.  I also currently have ~$7,000 in savings at the moment.

Expenses:

Monthly expenses at a bare minimum include Rent, car insurance, Cell phone, Food, other misc travel (for work), and i factored in 100$ for miscellaneous charges.  This leads to roughly $1698.00 in expenses per month, with ~$20,376 per year.

Summary:

With everything factored in there is only a very small amount left over per month that will more than likely get used for other unforeseen things.    With the money I am able to put away before I begin paying back loans I should be able to have ~$11,500.00

personalfinance,How to save for a house down payment with so many other financial priorities?,"I'm at a point in my life where I'd like to buy a house, however with everything else I need to do I don't see any realistic way I'll be able to save for a 20% down payment... At the moment I have about $1k excess available each month which I am using to build up an emergency fund (aiming for 3 months of current expenses, which I could extend to 6+ months with budget cuts and longer with unemployment).

I'm coming off a period of financial difficulty thanks to a divorce and the housing market and child support. I've been renting a house for 6 years now. I currently have about $5k in a retirement account, I'm 36 and I have some serious catching up to do in terms of savings.

So my financial priorities are to finish up the emergency fund which should be set by the end of this year, start kicking retirement savings into high gear and at some point, maybe, buy a house. My main motivation for buying a house is that rates are low right now and I don't want to worry about being kicked out because the owner decides to sell (happened once), rents increasing, not being able to install a ceiling fan in my bedroom, etc. 

My retirement plan is, starting next year, to begin maxing out my Simple IRA through work, as well as my HSA and a Roth IRA. By my calculations those 3 things should put me at $1 million by age 60 with a conservative 5 percent return. My investments will likely all be vanguard funds, and I plan to also eventually open up after tax accounts to get financially secure sooner. 

Now the catch is, a house. I figure I'm going to live where I'm at now for at least 10 years until the youngest child goes off to college, then I'm free to locate. I may have to relocate at some point in 10+ years because the job market where I'm at is terrible and remote work can be iffy. But say I'm here 10 years at least, after that who knows. Houses here are around $200k for a decent 3 bedroom. Maybe $180 if I find something small that needs some work, $250k+ for something nice. 

Call it $50k for a nice 20% down payment. That'd take around 4 years to save up for assuming no other emergencies happen (and other emergencies always happen). That's 4 years of delaying my retirement savings, at a point in my life where I should really be maxing them out. I'm not entirely comfortable with that. 

I see two options...

1. Don't buy a house. Rent for 10 years. Figure out what I want when the kids are gone, maybe move somewhere with cheaper real estate and get a smaller house or condo. 
2. Buy a house with a minimal down payment. I can get a 0% down payment through Navy Federal, 3.5% FHA or 5% conventional. However these mean you have no equity and a higher monthly payment and I'm not sold on that.

I must admit I also feel like at 36 I *should* be buying a house, like it's the grown up thing to do. But that's a silly reason. Really I just want the freedom to tackle whatever home improvement projects I know of and be assured no one is going to jack up my rent or force me to move. However financially I'm starting to wonder if home ownership is a lost cause for me...

business,Mobile POS and Going Plastic,"**Investment in mobile POS**

It is expected that 17-20% of total retail sales will be using a mobile device by 2016. Retailers across multiple industries and businesses both large and small were included in these estimates. With or without data, it makes sense – nowadays even one-of-a-kind businesses such as food trucks increasingly accept credit and debit cards.

Technological developments over the past few years have made it much easier for businesses to do this, especially with increased use of tablets as cash registers. Many apps are free or low-cost for businesses to install, meaning they can accept various forms of payment and increase the amount of customers they can serve. Prior to this, customers and businesses lost from a cash-only establishment – customers who want to buy and businesses who want to sell both get nothing when someone forgets to carry enough cash. According to a poll by Business Solutions, 48% of businesses polled plan on investing in [mobile POS hardware](http://www.bsminfo.com/doc/retail-tech-sales-it-s-all-about-the-consumer-0001). Why is this good for both retailers and consumers? Let’s explore the pros and cons.

**Pros/Cons in retail of going to mobile POS**

As businesses are increasingly able to accept credit card payments, customers will begin to expect this service. Cash can be as inconvenient for a customer to carry as it is for a business to pay credit card transaction fees. That is why low-cost mobile point-of-sale systems are so vital for businesses of the future. A business’s ability to accommodate customer needs will increase customer satisfaction and the business’s revenue. Mobile point-of-sales systems in particular allow businesses to come to customers directly, especially with a product like lottery tickets. The ability to reach out to customers directly, quickly and easily means tapping into a wider consumer base, which means increased revenue. As demand for more mobile point-of-sales systems increases, expect providers to appear that will drive the costs down.

That leads us to the two major fears for businesses looking to accept credit card payments and adopt mobile point-of-sale systems but have not – the first is fraud and the second is that transaction fees to credit card companies and banks may outweigh benefits of increased sales. Fraud from credit card payments is rare but still unavoidable at the present moment and so the only concern is for smaller businesses that cannot afford to lose money. Even only accepting debit, which would be financially safer for a business, comes with the cost of transaction fees. However there is already a push occurring in the United States for more regulation on the maximum amount of fees allowed. Typically banks charge around 1-3% per transactions, which is enough to drive some price-sensitive businesses (lots of food retailers included) away from accepting credit card payments.

Comparing the United States to many smaller markets yields interesting observations. Smaller markets may be more sensitive at the moment to transaction fees but the push towards credit and debit is still occurring. For example, Brazil went from 124 million credit cards in circulation in 2008 to 207.4 million in 2011 despite paying the highest interest rates for credit card loans. In Nigeria, there has been a growth of 38% in credit card circulation since 2003. Many African countries are still cash-based, but as infrastructure improves, expect this to change. Trends in Asia are also similar – Indonesia experienced a 45% increase in credit card usage from 2007-2008, rising to $9.8 billion in [payments](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-cards-around-the-world-1276.php). Again, the major takeaway is that sounder financial systems and infrastructure will lead to increased credit and debit card usage.

**What this means for lotteries**

So what does this have to do with lotteries? Most lottery businesses in smaller countries of the Caribbean, Latin America and the Asia are small, making them more price-sensitive to credit card transaction fees. The low-cost of most lottery tickets may also hamper any resolve to adopt a mobile point-of-sale system that would accept credit or debit cards. So the solution to this problem requires a platform that allows customers to access lotteries from mobile devices and save card information, either by a credit and/or cash account, allowing deposits and withdrawals into an individual account used to play lottery. A platform that allows lottery platforms to use their local cash transaction and credit account facilities [such as LocusPlay](http://locusplay.com/) would allow an easy transition from paper to digital.

This continual stream of revenue for the business should offset transaction costs. Lotteries should also look to the widespread, popular appeal of credit/debit to see why they should adopt a mobile point-of-sale system. Carrying cards is easier and more convenient than cash. Customers are everywhere, which means lotteries should try to reach out to them rather than waiting for them to come— only then can lotteries maximize their potential. Picking up on future trends is essential, especially in emerging markets where being ahead of the curve and anticipating customer needs in advance will allow lottery operators to have all the tools they need to capture a larger customer base. Increased usage of credit cards, accounts and debit cards is a clear trend and should be noticed.

Though moving from a cash-only establishment to adopting a mobile point-of-sale system can be tricky and even a hassle for businesses most indicators point to a long-term payoff. As technology improves and accepting various forms of payments becomes increasingly easy, lottery operators should take note. As unique as the lottery industry may be, we are no exception to business trends, especially one as beneficial as mobile points-of-sale.",finance,1405576248

personalfinance,Confused Grad Student Looking to Apply for Her First Credit Card,"Hey guys,

I am about to begin my last year as a graduate student and have recently realized it's time to begin building (or at least contemplating) good credit. I don't plan on buying a house or (really ever) getting a car loan until I am in my thirties which is a little under a decade from now. I'm strictly interested in building my credit so I have the freedom to do so in the future if the inclination arises.

My questions revolve around which card I should chose to apply for. Right now, I'm looking at:

**I**. Discover IT for Students 

or

**II.** Visa Platinum Rewards Credit Card (provided through my local Credit Union

These are my ""stats"", if you will:

* Unmarried

* Roughly $20,000 in federal students loans (5K in UnSub, the rest is Sub)

* No other outstanding debts

* Squeaky clean credit report

* Transunion Credit Score of **707** according to Credit Karma

* Member of my local Credit Union for going on 7 years (not sure if that's pertinent information), and I have only overdrafted once many moons ago. 

I do not EVER intend to carry a balance. I am very frugal, and never spend outside of my means. The only thing I will use this credit card for are bills, gas, groceries, etc. I work for my university for peanuts on fellowship, so I do not spend money on anything extraneous or ""fun"" which is excellent training for when I begin paying back my loans. :)

So, without further ado:

How likely is it that I will be approved for these cards?

Because CK is not necessarily a reliable indicator of my score, would it be safer for me to apply for a secured card through my credit union instead? 

Do my federal loans hinder me in regards to apply for credit cards? I have not been required to make a payment, but from my understanding large amounts of debt (whether in default or not) make lenders balk. 

Thank you! I appreciate any input you can provide, and would be happy to provide more information if necessary.

economy,Keynes and Lenin on QE and the Wealth Gap,"""Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become 'profiteers,' who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery. Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose"" 

-- John Maynard Keynes

These words ring true today as the Wealth Gap continues to expand as a consequence of the Fed's expansionary monetary policies (ZIRP, QE) juicing asset markets to all time highs, causing the rich to get richer, while poor and middle class people are struggling to keep up with rising standard of living costs.  

And not one in a million, especially in the media, is able to figure out the Fed policies cause this Wealth Gap

personalfinance,"Max out Roth IRA or payoff student loans with a low, but variable, interest rate?","I have about $14K of student loans that are currently sitting at 3.25% interest. However, these are private student loans and the interest rate is variable. I have the money to max out both my and my wife's Roth IRA ($11K), but I'm debating whether I should put it towards the loans instead. I know that nobody can predict interest rate swings, but rates have been low for so long that I assume we're due for an increase soon.

Any advice on this? My usual interest rate cutoff for paying off debt vs. investing is 4%, so if these were fixed I would definitely go with the Roth IRA, but given the variable rate I'm not sure how to proceed with this.",finance,1405602859
personalfinance,Sofi can drop my interest rate to a 4.16% 5 year variable. Do I make the switch?,"I currently have 23k at 6.55 through sallie mae from grad school.  Over the past year I've paid down around 18k in loans as my wife and I are putting pretty much all of our discretionary income into the loans.  We both have stable jobs, a 12k emergency fund, and no other monthly payment other than rent.  

At the pace of 1250 a month I could have the current loans paid off in 1 year 8 months with $1300 in interest paid.  If I switched to sofi and the interest rate stayed the same I could drop my monthly payment to 800 dollars and pay the same amount of interest over the life of the loan.  This would free up monthly cash flow to hit my current goal of 15% retirement savings for my wife and I (currently at 10% with 401k).  

So I have to figure out the risk/reward here.  If the interest rate was 3% I think I would make the switch no problem and pay minimum payments and adjust if the libor rate jumped.  However, at 4.16% I still think i would want to put a lot of money into the loans to pay them off more quickly.

news,Sky High Insurance Rates in Louisiana!,"Thursday, July 17th, 2014
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

WHY ARE PROPERTY INSURANCE
RATES GOING UP IN LOUISIANA?

What on earth is happening out there?  Is a major hurricane churning in the Gulf and taking dead aim at Louisiana?  Is the Mighty Mississippi on the verge of overflowing its levees and about to flood thousands of acres, driving hundreds of thousands from their homes? Something drastic must be up. After all, State Farm Insurance Company just raised its rates on Louisiana homeowners by as much as 20%.

Note that I said that State Farm raised its rates. In most states, insurance companies are subject to a pre-approval process wherein the insurance department determines if the increase is warranted, so that the property owner can be assured that the increase is both fair and necessary.  But Louisiana is different.  In the Bayou State, insurance companies are not required to get rate increases pre-approved.  So the answer to the question of how come big insurance companies can stick it to homeowners, whether or not such an increase is justified, is simply this -- they do it because they can. 

Back in the days when I served as Louisiana Insurance Commissioner, I worked with Texas Commissioner Bob Hunter on a variety of insurance issues affecting our respective states.  Currently, he’s the Insurance Director for the Consumer Federation of America.  I called him to get his view on the dramatically rising property insurance rates in Louisiana.  “Puzzling,” he said.  “A real outlier.  Maybe a slight increase because of inflation.  But such a big increase is really questionable.”

The national insurance reporting publications indicate why property insurance rates should be going down, not up.  The FPN Insurance Journal reported that natural catastrophes caused less than half the damage this year compared to the past 10 year average.  USA Today reports that we are experiencing one of the quietest years for hurricanes and other national disasters in many years.  The Insurance Journal reported that insurance companies nationwide have seen rate reductions in the past three years.

With no major storms in recent years, “more capacity will become available and prices will start to come down,” says Shivan Subramaniam, chief executive of commercial property insurer FM Global.  So all over the country, insurance rates for homeowners have stabilized and should begin to decrease.  But not in Louisiana?  Huh? Surrounding coastal states have just as much exposure to natural disasters as Louisiana does.  But they are experiencing no huge rate increases.  When there is no prior approval of rates, up they go.

Let me share a story of how effective proper regulation can be.  Under the old system, the governor appointed a six member rating commission.  Insurance companies had to appear before the commission and make their case for any rate increase.  As insurance commissioner, I served as chairman of the commission, and then Governor Mike Foster made the appointments.  The system served as a good check and balance.

State Farm asked the commission for a major increase in December, 1997.  Governor Foster called me and asked that I convey to the members that he wasn’t for any rate increase, particularly as the holidays were approaching.  I told the commissioners of the Governor’s concerns, but State Farm did a major lobbying job of wining and dining them.  In spite of joint objections from both the Governor and me, the commission unanimously approved the State Farm rate increase.  The next morning around 6:30 am my phone rang.  “Jim, Mike Foster.  Sorry to bother you so early, but I have one question.  Did you tell my appointed commissioners of my concern that no rate increase should be given to State Farm?”  I told him, yes, I had conveyed his message to each of the seven commissioners. “Thanks, that’s all I needed.”

Three hours later, Governor Foster called a press conference and fired all seven commissioners.  An insurance company needs to have a fair rate in order to stay in business.  But gouging the property owner without justification and some type of check and balance is not fair to the insured, and bad for economic growth in the state.

The legislature, the governor and the insurance department could learn a good lesson from the Foster years.  Be fair, but don’t let rate increases take place at a company’s whim.  Property owners deserve better.

personalfinance,I have 10k saved up...should I use it to pay off a few student loans? (23y.o),"Hey R/PersonalFinance

I have about 10k saved up in a savings account that I have been nursing for about a year now.  I really don't operate with much of a budget and save sporadically.  I have been throwing money into this savings account since it dipped to 1,500 in September of last year (I was unemployed for a few months and needed it to keep afloat).

I will be honest I have not been the best on paying my student loans on time and I would probably guess that my credit is horrendous (however I do not have a credit card, I don't finance a car, essentially it's just my student loans and cable bill...which are never paid on time...smh).  

I make about 30k a year living at home working 3 different jobs.  

I was going to call my student loan handlers and find out how much money I'd need to just pay them off in one shot.  I calculated that I owe about 10,5 across three separate loans (interest rate is at around 6.7%).  I was going to either pay off all three (obliterating my tiny nest egg and setting me back to zero) or just two and slowly pay off the other.  

Its mostly because I find I am terrible at keeping up with bills and the like.  What would you all suggest?  Also are there any tips on creating a budget?  I feel like I have this anxiety with just knowing how much money I have in my account.  Basically I just end up spending money on my checking without ever checking the balance.  I make enough that I never overdraft...but I feel like I am not actually using my money for anything of  use and nothing to show for it (I want to move out...but living in NYC sucks).  I want to get more mature with paying my bills...but I feel like there is just a wall up against me.  I procrastinate them so much...even when I could easily take 15 minutes to just write the check and pay them.

personalfinance,Best short-term loan options to pay for grad school until employer reimburses.,"I lucked out.  My employer is willing to pay for up to 100% of my MBA (exact amount based on grades).  The tuition reimbursement will be paid at the end of each semester, after I submit my grades.

This leaves me with a little bit of a conundrum.  I don't have enough cash on hand to comfortably pay the tuition out-of-pocket (don't want to drain my emergency fund), which means I'll need to take out a loan.

At this point, my plan is to take out a loan ($10,000 Fed Direct Unsub Loan @ 4.66% until graduation) for the first semester and then use that reimbursement to pay for the 2nd semester, continuing that pattern until I complete my degree.  Meanwhile, I can use my income to pay off the 1st semester loan as quickly as possible.

Is this going to be the best way to avoid paying a ton of interest?  If anyone can think of something clever, I'd love to hear it.

personalfinance,Trying to make smart investing decisions for retirement. Any advice appreciated,"I recently started reading the personal finance subreddit. I have been impressed with the more experienced posters' generous willingness to help people who have varying levels of knowledge about investing. I am in the beginning-to-try-to-understand financial planning phase, and have spent the past week reading as many posts as possible, FAQs, and general guidelines on investing mentioned in various discussions here.

Because those posts have inspired my wife and I to be more serious and intelligent about our financial decisions, I wanted to seek any advice you all are willing to offer. The following post is lengthy, but I figured it would be best to ask my questions all at once and people could respond to any parts they cared to comment on.

My wife's and my target retirement date is roughly 2045.

-Our combined income, without taxes, is ~$200,000 per year.

-We do not plan to have kids.

-We are renting, and do not plan to buy a house, for various reasons.

-We do not have any debt.
 
To try to make sure our money is invested intelligently, I am following the general advice from this graphic.
  http://i.imgur.com/PWfvdvB.png

[1] We have set up a $25,000 Emergency Fund. Right now, that money is in an online checking account drawing .8% interest. I have looked into depositing ~$10,000 into [Legacy Bank and Trust](https://www.legacybankandtrust.com/checking_accounts#iprofit) to take advantage of the 4%, and $14,000 to [Lake Michigan Credit Union](https://www.lmcu.org/banking/checking/checking_max.aspx) to take advantage of the 3%. I would jump through the necessary hoops on a monthly basis to ensure we earned those interest rates.

Is shifting that money to those accounts a wise decision? Are there drawbacks to that that I am not recognizing and I should just keep things in the .8% account?

[2] More significantly, my wife's 401k: My wife is maxing out her contributions at $17,500 per year. She currently has $60,000 in that account.

After reading more about Jack Bogle's investment philosophy, the three-fund portfolio and asset allocation, and the importance of choosing low-cost funds, I looked over my wife's 401K investments, especially with an eye on the fees. 

The two funds she has been invested in for the past five years are:

-American Century Strategic Allocation Moderate - 1.0% fee   [86% of her 401K is invested in this fund]

-American Century Strategic Allocation Aggressive .87% fee  [13% of her 401K is invested in this fund]

I looked through the list of other funds she has available to her, in search of a lower fee, and saw these:

JPMCB Equity Index-CF - .10% fee   (18.68% return over 5 years)

JPMorgan Large Cap Growth-R6 - .71% fee    (13.87% return over 3 years)

JP Morgan Market Expansion Enhanced Index-Select   .70% fee  (21.43% return over 5 years)

If I am reading things correctly, given projected retirement date, my wife and I should  have our investments in 90% stocks and 10% bonds (at least according to the Vanguard target date retirement fund percentages). Within the 90% devoted to stocks, 70% should be devoted to a low fee index fund for the U.S., and 30% should be devoted to a low fee index fund for international markets. 

From what I am reading, the JPMCB Equity Index fund ""seeks investment results that correspond to the aggregate price and dividend performance of securities in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (S&amp;P 500 Index). The fund invests in stocks included in the S&amp;P 500 Index and also may invest in stock index futures.""

-&gt; Since the JPMCB Equity Index focuses on U.S. stocks, and has a low fee, do you recommend that my wife invests 63% (70% of the 90% devoted to stocks) of her 401K in that? Please advise if you disagree with this.

-27% of her 401K should be invested in international stocks. I'm looking at the list of funds in her plan that focus on international markets, and she has these available:

Oppenheimer International Small Company-Y, 1.0% fee (%21.81 growth over past five years)

Harbor International-Inst, .76% fee (13.58% growth over past five years, 10.01% over past ten years)

-&gt; Do either of those sound appealing? 

-10% of her money should be invested in bonds. She has the following available to her:

JPMCB Stable Asset Income Fund - .51% fee (1.77% return over 5 years, 3.12% over 10 years)(not sure if this is focused on bonds?)

PIMCO Total Return-Inst - .46% fee (6.39% return over 5 years, 6.38% over 10 years)
  (According to what I found online, ""A solid core bond choice for millions of investors."")

-&gt; Should I put 10% in PIMCO Total Return?

[2] My 403b.

I am just now setting this up (I was foolish to not do it last year when I got my current job, but lesson learned, at least). I do not have any other retirement savings. I will be devoting a considerable % of my paycheck for the rest of the year to maxing out the $17,500.

The investment options available are through TIAA-CREF.
Funds available to me:

CREF Equity Index account - .39% fee (18.86% return over 5 years, 7.81% over 10 years) (99% in U.S. stocks)

CREF Stock Account - .46% fee (16.61% over 5 years, 7.52% over 10 years)
    (68.69% of the fund is in U.S. stocks, 30.74% in International stocks)

CREF Growth Account - .46% fee (21.68% over 5 years, 7.86% 10 years)
    (94% of the fund is in U.S. stocks, ~5% in international stocks)

International focused funds available to me:

TIAA Access Account - TIAA-CREF International Equity Fund Level 4 .76% fee (18.86% return over 5 years, 6.96% over 10 years)
   (98% in international equity)

-&gt; Should I just put 90% of my 403b in the CREF Stock account, since it already has the 70% U.S. and 30% international split?)  Or should I put 70% in CREF Equity Index and 30% in International Equity Fund Level 4?

-10% of my 403b should be invested in bonds. The choices available to me are:

CREF Inflation-Linked Bond Account -  .41% fee, (4.79% return over 10 years)

CREF Bond Market Account - .45% fee (4.54% return over 10 years)

TIAA-Cref Bond Plus Fund Level 4 - .68% fee (6.53% return over 5 years)

-&gt; Any thoughts on which of those looks most appealing?
[I don't know where this would fit, but I also have available to me the ""TIAA Real Estate Account"" -.87% fee (%4.95 return over 5 years)]


Once I get my wife's 401k and my 403b invested correctly, I'm going to set up either Roth or Traditional IRA's for both of us. And then we have about $75,000 that is sitting in a %.8 online checking account (we had been saving up for a house payment, but then recently decided not to go that route). I anticipate investing that with Vanguard (any advice on particular funds?), and I have some questions about that, but this post has already gone on long enough.

personalfinance,Is there a way to transfer your student loans onto a credit card?,"Don't worry, I don't just want to pay off my loans with credit cards and then get into even more debt. 

I know that its not an uncommon thing to transfer debt from one credit card to another for the primary reason of transferring to a card with a lower interest rate. When you do this, there are still transfer fees but you can still save money in the end. 

I have about $11,000 left in student loans and I've been pretty good about paying off a big chunk each month. I have no problem making payments. The only thing is that these are not all one loan. There are about 8 or 9 different loans with different amounts and different interest rates. Some of the rates are low, like 3.4% but some are much higher like 6.8%. 

When I pay, it just gives me the option to add a bank account and I just route it to my checkings. Could I somehow pay this all off at once with a credit card that has a lower interest rate and then proceed to pay off the credit card?

""Breaking Down the BitLicense"" | Marco Santori, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chairman, The Bitcoin Foundation

Hi everyone.  I’m Marco Santori.  For those of you who don’t know me, I’m a lawyer here in New York City.  About 90% of my practice is digital currency clients.  My team represents some of the biggest names in crypto, and even more of the littlest names I hope you’ll all have to learn one day.  I am also Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee, but the thoughts in this post are my own, *not* those of the Foundation.  Believe me, those are forthcoming.

You’ve likely felt the shockwaves of today’s seismic news: New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) has released proposed “BitLicense” regulations. Here is a quick rundown of some of the more interesting terms, along with my gut reactions – in no particular order and with very little filter.

Definition of Virtual Currency: “Virtual Currency” seems to include bitcoin and other convertible currencies, but specifically exclude WOW [World of Warcraft] gold and customer affinity points.  Expectedly, there is no carve-out for coins used to track digital assets and there is no specific treatment of branded coins that are quasi-convertible.

Who Requires a License: Surprise!  Everyone does.  Direct purchasers and sellers, multi-sig wallet providers, merchant payment processors, custodial exchanges, hell, even local wallet software providers probably need one.  Payment processors and payment networks all need licenses.  Anyone who receives or transmits crypto as a business needs one.  This is because the BitLicense language is even broader than the federal language, which only regulates those receiving and transmitting funds.

Identity Verification: If a BitLicense holder “opens an account” for a customer, then that firm must collect and retain the customer’s name and address, check the names against the OFAC SDN lists and retain that information for ten years.  It’s difficult to know what “opens an account” means.  Even if we figured that out, this is more than even traditional money transmitters are required to do.

Crypto is not a “Permissible Investment”: A BitLicense holder can only invest its earnings in: government securities, money market funds, insured CDs. No investing in Bitcoin. Strange – Moneygram is permitted to invest in dollars…

Full Reserve: A BitLicense holder may not lend or spend bitcoins that it is holding on its customers’ behalf.  Those bitcoin “banks” out there promising returns on your “deposits” are going to be “felons”.

State-level AML Reporting: I’ve saved the best for last. NY is taking the first steps to create yet another anti-money laundering program. FinCEN – the federal regulator - already requires reporting cash transactions over $10k. Now, NY is requiring reporting to it for any crypto transactions over $10k. BitLicense holders must also file *state* Suspicious Activity Reports with NY, not just the ones required to file with FinCEN. I wonder how the boys at FinCEN feel about this.

There will be a 45-day comment period beginning on July 23rd.  If you disagree with any of these proposals, you should submit comments.  If there is anything you agree with, and are happy to see, you should submit comments.  If there is anything you don’t understand, and so aren’t sure if you agree or disagree, guess what?  You should submit comments.  DFS is giving the industry an opportunity to engage in a dialogue that never existed when FinCEN and IRS published their famous virtual currency guidance.  We should not ignore that opportunity.

If you’re looking for assistance or just want to talk crypto law, you can reach me at msantori@nmllplaw.com.

(Back to TBI)

There is much work to be done with this BitLicense proposal.  It will be a defining bit of regulation for the industry, which means that the amount of constructive feedback and proactive effort needed from everyone in this industry must be nothing short of herculean if bitcoin is to evolve unencumbered in the US.  This proposal simply cannot survive as is.  So if you are an entrepreneur, investor or just general enthusiast, you better step up this summer.  If we can make our case effectively, we should be able to keep the sane, legitimizing parts and scrap the stifling, unnecessary parts of the proposal.  

Many more of my organized thoughts tomorrow…   

Cheers,

I got nothing from FAFSA (2,000) and so basically ill be acquiring a 20k debt starting october. 







More info: Going to a trade school in AZ that will cost me about 20,000 dollars. The school has an 89% job placement and avg starting pay right out of school is anywhere from 11-14$ an hour. Assuming that i can get a job right out, $20,000 is still ALOT especially if i end up with something at 11$ an hour starting pay. I applied for FAFSA and got nothing except $2,000 which has a 5% interest rate. Thats the best i can do. Reason being my parens make JUST enough to be considered ""well off"" but not enough to drop 20,000 on a school. 




So I'm just wondering if there are any tips or things i can do to be proactive about whats about to happen this next year and the debt ill be acquiring. Also any other type of ways to go about attaining my goal ect. Just tryna get some other insight and be as financially smart about this as possible.

personalfinance,How do I reduce my total effective tax rate? (USA),"22 years old, single, renter. I was curious about how much my effective tax rate is and took all of my taxes so far this year and divided them by my total pay before taxes (total gross earnings)

Fed income: 14%

RRB (like SS): 10.5%

Medicare: 1.4%

State: None (yay Texas)

All seems fine right? Well when you add them all up, it amounts to about 26% of my gross earnings. According to [this website](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456), that puts me in between the 96th and 99th percentile. I sure don't feel like a ""1%er."" 

What can I do to reduce this rate? Is there anything possible without getting credits or reduced rates for stuff like joint filing, child credits, owning a house, etc? I know that I can't do much about RRB and Medicare. What about the fed income?",finance,1405631814

I'm kind of new to Student Loans and had a few questions. I'm not really sure where to post this so I hope this is the right place. 

A little background...  I've been out of school about a year now. I have payments of just under $600/mo, but I only make $1200 a month. I'm looking for help to either lower my payments, defer my loans to a time when I will make more money, or anything else I may not have thought of. I have some questions, but completely open to any tips/tricks anyone can offer:

*How easy/difficult is deferment? What is the minimum I can make monthly and still qualify to defer?

*I have loans taken out yearly for school. What is the pros/cons of consolidation? Will I get charged a Fee for doing so? Is this a good route to take in the long run and is it possible consolidating can lower my interest rate?

*Are there any options y'all know about which may make it possible to lower the amount I actually pay (either in the short or long term) for the loans?

I'm really just looking for some hardline facts because everything I read on the internet seems very convoluted and not very helpful or somewhat like a scam.

personalfinance,"Edit: A letter. Defaulted on Education Loan with AES/Charter Bank, can I get GradPlus loan?","Hello -

So long story, a relative convinced me to get a student loan right as I turned 18. They needed help upfront and would ""pay me back"" for it. They cosigned, it was approved, and long story short: their business went under and they ended up going to prison for 5 years on fraud, etc.

I'm now in my mid 20s and starting med school in September. I've been able to get the subsidized and unsub federal loans so far without a problem, but I'll need more help financially and want to do the Grad Plus loan.

I've researched around a bit and from what I understand the grad plus is a federal loan but credit based. My credit is currently around 690-720 depending on CC utilization that month, but I do have the AES/Charter Bank ""Education Loan"" negatively marked on there and not set to fall off till Oct 2016.

I tried about a year ago to get a private loan through sallie mae and was rejected. I don't recall specifics, but it may have been due to not having a cosigner, but my fear is that it may have been from this AES loan, so now I'm worrying that I won't be able to get the GradPlus loan now.

Will this impact my grad plus loan eligibility since it's technically not a student loan? My understanding is that student loans can't be defaulted or fall off from your credit... so I feel like this is a private loan thats been tagged as ""educational"" now and will cause me to lose eligibility.

Is grad plus just purely credit score based?

What options, if any, do I have in order to try and remove this?

or maybe change the status from educational to private, or remedy this situation?

I'm honestly stuck. It's a lot of money. A lot. I can't pay it back, I don't even have money for my day to day right now, and can't get into payment arrangements or anything. I don't even know what questions to ask or how to go about this.

So I'm finally coming to terms with my life that I really need to budget my finances. I have spent my entire post high school life (I am currently 32) just using my checkbook to budget. After college, I got a full time job that I rarely went to. I honestly hated it and eventually got a better job that I was at for almost 7 years until I was fired. During that time, I paid off my truck and eventually sold the truck and bought a new car. But I bought the car right before I was terminated. So all of last year I was on unemployment and had a very hard time budgeting and paying my bills. I made it through and found a new job.

So my current job is not the greatest pay-wise. I was at one point making $16.50 at my last job and took a huge paycut and I am now making $11.50. My entire budget took a hit because of this. I currently can afford all my bills and my car payment. But I also enjoy buying and playing Magic: the Gathering, which is a huge money sink. This is why I am here:

*I want to pay off my car loan as quickly as possible. $10,716.17 @ 3.49% interest rate. I was putting $300 but now put $400 a month on it, which is like almost one paycheck.

*Pay off my Credit card debt $785.16 @ 27.99% APR. I'm not planning on using this card after August (it's a Disney rewards card)

*Pay off my paypal debt $183.22

*Increase my savings. So far, my total savings: $2060.84.

My fiancee and I want to eventually get married and get our own place but I know my savings is horrendous in terms of that. But I really need to budget and I have a very hard time doing it since it can be very confusing to me. Is there something for someone like me to be able to use to be able to budget as well as pay off my debt and save money? Like I said, I'm very new to this and want to make sure I do it right.

I've attempted to fill out my FAFSA information, and with my previous schooling (AAS in Business Administration), I didn't qualify for a subsidized loan (though I'm not sure if it was an unsubsidized Stafford loan or just an unsubsidized loan, and haven't found a way to differentiate between the two). I currently have about $2,000 remaining on my previous loans, and my education is looking to cost me around $90k. My yearly income (through my full-time job) is approximately $34k.

I'm in need of some extra cash but by no means desperate for it. I work an hourly instructional position in a school and I continue to work this summer. I don't work as many hours but I do still have income throughout the summer and once the school year starts I will be back on my normal budget. I planned for a tight summer knowing that I'm moving into a new place and I leased a new vehicle. I wish I had the foresight to start saving for summer earlier but I wasn't as wise with my money when I got the job (I went from unemployed college grad due to student teaching to making a couple hundred more per paycheck than I was use to in college, wasn't as wise with my money but you learn from mistakes). 

I wanted to cash some of the bonds in order to give myself a little bit of a buffer for the rest of the summer. Now to get to the bonds. 

I have 22 EE bonds and of those 22 there are 13 of them purchased before 1995 that provide of 4% interest rate. The oldest of these is one from 12/1989 and the newest of them is from 12/1994. The remaining 9 of them are dates ranging from 11/1995 up to 12/1998. They are evenly split between a 1.42% and a 1.34% interest rate with one odd ball at 1.19%. 

I understand the bonds will reach final maturity 30 years from their issue date and I do know the older bonds are closer to no longer gaining interest. Even though the newer bonds have not accrued as much interest I figured long term it would be smarter to cash some of those because the rate is lower and won't come anywhere near the value that the 4% bonds provide at final maturity. 

I want to spread out when I cash these anyways for income tax purposes. For that reason I know I'll cash something this summer even though nothing is at final maturity. 

I think I provided enough details for an educated response but let me know if people need more. Open to suggestions and I appreciated it in advance.

personalfinance,Motorcycle dealer opened credit card I didn't want - how upset should I be about this?,"I've been considering buying a motorcycle to commute on. I found one I liked on craigslist located at a dealer nearby. It was priced a little high, but I liked it so I decided to check it out. The bike was $5500, my plan was to offer $5000 with about $1500 down, and the rest would hopefully be on a loan. I know it is probably pretty stupid to take out a loan for that small amount, but I'm back in college full time and couldn't afford thing up front. The final decision on whether to actually buy the bike or not was riding on how low the interest rate would be. My credit union was willing to give me a ridiculously low rate (something like 3%) couple months prior, but that deal fell through and I hadn't asked again.

At the dealer I ended up talking to a sales guy who had me fill out some credit check forms so he could check on a loan. My fault here was not checking the paperwork carefully enough, I'm assuming these credit check forms were actually the paperwork for the credit card. I told the sales guy specifically that I wanted to see what kind of rate I could get on a loan and I would go from there. After filling out the forms, he leaves for a few minutes and comes back telling me that my income is too low and I can't get approved for any loans, but that I've been approved for a Kawasaki credit card at 8% interest. I told him this was too high for me and I'd rather do a loan through my credit union, and I'd talk to my credit union and come back. Some other annoying things happened, like him planning on including a 3 year warranty in the deal we never even discussed, so I decided to walk away from the deal altogether.

Today I received a letter in the mail telling me about a change of address for my Kawasaki credit card, the card the dealer never even bothered to tell me was opened. The balance on the card was $0. When I called the card company and told them I had never agreed to open the card, they weren't interested at all and told me they could only close it for me at this point and it was going to stay on my credit. I'm pretty upset that I now am going to have this card I never wanted  on my credit for at least the next few years.

* I have $15,000 left in student loans which I am aggresively paying off at a rate of $2500 per month. I am not worried about this loan because it will be paid off very shortly and the interest rate is somewhere around 5% (not exactly sure).

When doing my taxes, my total income amounted to $16,000 because around $10,900 (Room and Board is around $12,400 at my school) of my scholarship was counted as income. Not only did I receive no federal tax returns, but I had to pay $1,200 in taxes ($850 federal and $350 state of Kentucky)! This was an insane financial burden on me. No one at my school helped me or even prepared me for such a financial hit. 

Here is my question, how can I lower how much tax I pay? $1,200 at this point in my life is a ridiculous amount of money. I know one mistake I made was allowing my mother to claim me as a dependent. Next time I will not allow anyone to claim me as a dependent. What else can I do? Almost no one I know has had to pay taxes on their scholarship because they didn't know they are supposed to report it to the IRS. I literally asked everyone I know and no one has ever had to pay taxes on their scholarship. I just don't understand how everyone else I know gets away with not paying taxes on their scholarship.

personalfinance,"Buying a Car from Dealer (ON, Can)","Buying a car in Ontario. Have 15K in cash saved up. Am interested in buying a 2010 CR-V; have found one listed dealer price for 14995. Spoke to the dealer, final price point is 16980 (including licensing - 35.00, taxes - 1949.00, etc.)

CarFax is clean - no accidents or estimates. Car was formerly a lease. Has 89K on it. Consistently serviced at Honda dealership in QC (which is where car is from).

My question is: I want to get the best deal. I previously bought a car a few years ago and was stupid as shit. I used dealership financing, had a very high interest rate, and generally got hosed. I am in a much better place in my life now and want to be prepared. I am just so afraid of making a bad choice again. Ideally I'd like to go in, test drive, and offer the cash payment of 15K for the entire vehicle.

Can you offer me some feedback about looking into this vehicle, and other vehicles like it? I am looking at CR-Vs, as I have driven a few and really like it, love Honda's reliability, and am in need of that type of vehicle for work/life (hitch is a necessity).

Does this seem like a good deal? Is there something else I am missing? I have been reading Reddit as well as few other sources online about buying cars. I'm planning on test driving this weekend and will be looking at the engine, oil, transmission fluid, brake pads, exhaust, body, etc. I am trying to line up a mechanic to look at it (I recently moved to a new city, but a friend of mine has a very reputable mechanic - she is a former professional driver and puts great stock in them). 

Are there other things I'm missing? Is this crazy dumb? Would love PF's feedback.",finance,1405688934

Ideally I would want this new loan still classified as a student loan so I could count the interest paid on my taxes.

personalfinance,"Types of loans, how credit cards or lines of credit should be used, and generally removing some of the mystery.","I commented this in reply to a redditor who was very confused about how debts and credit limits are determined, what LTV means, and how a bank decides how much you can be approved for. I thought it might be useful for everyone here to read.

1.
There are two broad categories of loans.

2.
There are installment loans where you make principal and interest payments. And then there are lines or 'revolvers' where you make interest only payments until you receive the cash flow to pay them back down.

3.
Revolvers are things like credit cards or lines of credit. Try to understand an operating line of credit collateralized by accounts receivable first. Many times a business will have expenses (such as payroll) that need to be paid before they actually receive the cash from their sales from their customers. Imagine you sell a guy a boat which he's going to finish paying by the end of the month. It was a huge sale and in order to have the cash to be able to pay your employees salaries you really need that money from the sale of the boat but you won't get that till the end of the month. You are stuck in the middle. Your employees can't wait a month for their paychecks. So what do you do? You have a operating line of credit from the bank with a limit of X amount. You pay your employees their salaries using your 'big credit card' aka line of credit. This runs up the balance and until it gets paid down you will accrue interest on it. But, it's no big deal because as soon as the customer send you a fat check for the boat you can pay the bank back for the amount you borrower in the mean time and the balance will go back down to zero. Credit cards should work on the same reasoning. Really you should not be running up a credit card or line of credit unless you have no reason to believe that your cash inflows are only temporarily delayed compared to your expenses and you will have no problem paying it off once your paycheck comes in. Where people get in trouble is they spend their cash, they run up the card, then once their check comes in they still haven't paid for food and gas so they pay for that too and now they don't have enough to pay down the credit card! So the balance remains at the end of the month and it's still there at the beginning of the next month. And the cycle goes on and on with them accruing a bunch of interest without ever paying it back. Credit cards are NOT supposed to maintain that balance. It's up to you to know that you'll be able to pay it back soon AND meet your other obligatory monthly expenses. If you won't be able to pay it back you shouldn't be running up the card unless it's a medical emergency (ideally, you should already be saving money for emergencies anyways). But if you haven't saved money for emergencies then a credit card can save your ass till you figure out a way to make up for it later. Accruing interest is a slippery slope and can really drain your funds and quickly get out of hand and put you in over your head. Banks aren't being sadistic allowing you to have those higher credit card limits because if you had been budgeting correctly you should have had no problem paying it back. Unfortunately there is absolutely no way a bank can stop you from running up your credit card on unnecessary things and putting yourself in a position you can't get out of. Credit cards by nature are NOT a bad thing. They are a free 30 day loan. Free loans are always good. It's when you don't budget your ability to pay it back that you'll have a problem.

4.
Just because the borrower runs up their $100,000 balance doesn't necessarily mean they're dumb. As long as they're just waiting on that big boat sale check to come in for $125,000 so they can pay off the $100,000 balance on their line, then that's perfectly reasonable and an example of how a line of credit can be extremely useful tool. Debt is not necessarily a bad thing. It's a TOOL that when used properly can allow businesses to run smoothly like a well oiled machine. But if they run the balance up with no accounts receivable to back it up that's when you can screw yourself. This bring me to LTV.

5.
A bank isn't just going to approve you for a line of credit without documentation of your receivables and a statement called an 'aging of accounts receivable'. (Basically a schedule showing which accounts have been outstanding for more than 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days). The bank chooses the maximum balance of your LOC based on the asset value of your accounts receivable. The loan will ALWAYS be less than the amount of your accounts receivable. This is because it's assumed that SOME of your accounts won't ever pay you back. Just because someone owes you doesn't mean you're actually getting that check. So their are all sorts of detailed policies for banks concerning the maximum LTV for LOC's based on all sorts of factors like your ability to collect on them historically, what the A/R's are for the sale of, how long you expect to have to wait for them to come in, etc etc etc.

6.
LTV just means loan to value. Say you have accounts receivable balances of $1,000,000. i.e. you've sold boats and all the sales added up to $1,000,000 but you haven't been paid yet. The VALUE of your A/R is $1,000,000. The bank may be willing to offer you a line of credit with a maximum balance equal to about 70% of that (this varies). So they offer you a line of credit with a max balance of $700,000. The LTV in this case is 70%.

7.
There is no magical overall credit limit. We estimate your monthly payments on a fully advanced credit card using a 12% interest rate on a 48 month amortization. If the resulting payments are too high a percentage of your monthly income then we will deny the loan. A bank will allow you to have no more than 30% of your monthly income go towards your HOME payments which include rent OR principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. i.e. if you make $1,000 per month we're not gonna let your HOME payments exceed $300/month. This is called your 'front ratio'. There is also a back ratio. Back ratio is ALL pmts/income. And that limit is 40%. So if you're making $1,000/month and you're already paying $300/month for your housing expenses, then all your OTHER payments combined cannot exceed an additional $100/month. So in that example you may get approved for a credit card with a maximum balance of $3,797. Because based on a 48 month term at 12% that would put your credit card payment at $100/month. Does this mean you have the means to run it up to $3,797 right away and just leave it like that to accrue interest from now on? Absolutely not. You shouldn't run it up except as a temporary measure to meet expenses which you know you'll have the ability to pay back down sometime soon.

personalfinance,Progress -- Week 2,"Getting my financial house in order, have been restructuring and defining priorities:

* Emergency Fund
* Budget
* Track Spending
* Credit Card Usage

* Emergency Fund: I have reduced 401(k) to meet employer match. Eliminated deposits into IRA. The estimated amount; equal to previous retirement contributions, is set to automatically deposit into an online savings account. The plan is to adjust the deposit up/down after today so I can keep my take-home pay equal to what it was before. (I wasn't sure how the taxes would affect the final deposit amounts, so I'll adjust accordingly.) The 360 account is not my day to day bank, it's completely separate from the household account. I have other savings/money market accounts with some $ already, and have the Dave Ramsey suggested $1,000 already set aside. This new savings account is the actual ""Emergency Fund"" account so should something happen we won't have to scramble pulling money together that's inefficiently spread out and get caught thinking there is more than we actually have.

* Budget: I started using the ""You Need a Budget"" software. I'm about a week into it. I've used Mint for a while, and Excel before that -- I've had lots of experience tracking *where* the money was spent but no experience in *planning* where to spend so I thought YNAB to be the best bet. I've taken several of their online classes and found them to be very helpful. (I even won a free copy of the software  - yay!) 

* Track Spending: Now that we are using YNAB we've been discussing upgrading to some sort of smartphone to use the app to track as we spend, and also see what is budgeted for a certain category instead of trying to remember in the moment. I don't think a new phone is the only solution, but we're due to renew the contract, so we're discussing. The phones would be free and the increase in our monthly cell phone bill is estimated to be $30/month. (Would we save at least that much by following budgets? Yes, and more. But still, not convinced this is the right thing.) There has been years of writing in tiny notebooks, keeping receipts, trying to remember where that $40 went, etc. etc. and not keeping up.

* Credit Card usage: We have two credit cards with balances. One for day to day use and one with a larger balance. (The rest of our debt is student loans - both federal and private. The plan is to build the emergency fund first, work on creating the 1 month buffer that YNAB calls for - then tackling the debt with either snowball/avalanche method.) The credit card with the larger balance I have taken out of my wallet and stopped using for the last two weeks. The day to day card has a smaller balance and is used in place of a debit card.

personalfinance,Helping my future mother in law put some money away so she doesn't blow it on her jailbird son,"Hello everyone,

I'm in a frustrating situation that is as cliche as it gets. Here is the general back story.

As the saying goes, you don't get to pick your family... but in this case, I am marrying into this family so I guess it's not entirely true. I am engaged to my S.O, and her family is kind of crazy. (please do not make comments about getting out while I can, etc... this is financial advice, not relationship advice)

Her older brother is a habitual criminal, drug addict and liar and is as terrible as it gets. Now, I don't mean the following as any sort of insult to foreign ways or cultures, but this family is greek, and from what I can tell from my experiences with them, they act as if their first born sons can do no wrong. Their only mission in life is to coddle and protect them no matter what they do. Dropping LSD during their fathers funeral? no problem... Stealing family heirlooms and selling it for drug money? come right on in son and stay the night!  Anyways, you get the idea. 

There really seems to be NO way to break her mother out of this almost mental problem when it comes to her son, even though she is basically scared of him and hates him! But whenever it comes up, her excuse is always (in broken english) 'you no pick your family'... so she at least has it in the back of her head that he does wrong.

Ok, anyways thanks for the vent... on to the situation at hand:

Her mom is selling a house that she is flipping. After splitting the money with her partner, she will have about 32k in cash PLUS a monthly payment of 2500 for about 1-2 years from the buyer. I am so fed up with this jailbird sucking her dry both mentally and financially (again, he is almost 40 years old and 'borrows' money and still sells drugs, etc) so I want to help her some how stash this money away so that she can't give him any. Now, I don't want it to be so stashed away that she can't touch it at all (she might try to buy into another house to flip, or use it for general bills, etc) but there has to be some sort of way to store it so there is peace of mind on this.  Does anyone have any advice? I don't know much about CD's but can she put the 32k in a CD for a year and if she needs it can she take it back out in an emergency?  Or, am I getting into a hairy situation by offering to take the money and give it to her when she needs it?  

Thanks again everyone!

personalfinance,Pay As You Earn loan repayment advice? Chip away early or get forgiven?,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I just discovered this thread and would love some insight or advice for my financial situation. Sorry the following is such a novel but I figure that the more information you financial gurus have, the better advice I’ll receive. 

I’m 27, just finished graduate school, and have $131, 945.68 in Graduate Plus Loans and $81,226.97 in Stafford Loans, for a total of $213,172.65. Grad plus loans have interest rates of 7.65% and Stafford interest rates are 6.55%. 

I live in a large US city and make approximately $130,000/year. With my other monthly expenses in addition to my loan repayments, I’m able to save ~3,000-4000/month. I currently have ~$35,000 in savings after working for close to a year. My grandparents were incredibly gracious and set up investments in my name of approximately $64,000 and I have a roth IRA of approximately $14,000 that I contribute $450 to monthly. 

I’m currently enrolled in the Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan which has loan forgiveness attached in 20 years. The minimum payment I could be making according to my repayment plan is $568.45/month for the graduate plus and $352.36 towards the Stafford loan for a total of 920.81/month. 

I currently make monthly payments of $1100 to the grad plus loan and $600 to the Stafford, for a total of $1700/month. My family has always stressed that I should try to pay the loan down as much and as quickly as possible, thus the reasoning behind my higher monthly payments. 

My question is should I be making larger payments as I currently am and continue to increase the payments if I’m able? Or should I only be paying the minimum, as whatever’s left over after 20 years will be forgiven. I’m aware that I still have to pay taxes on whatever’s forgiven in 20 years which should be approximately 30-40%  of the lump sum forgiven. Almost everyone I graduated with is only making the minimum payment or just enough to barely touch the principal and socking away the extra money in preparation to pay the taxes on the forgiven amount in 20 years. They think I’m crazy for trying to pay it down now as it’ll be forgiven later (which seems like a valid point).

I’ve even considered liquidating the investments my grandparents set up for me to make a large chunk payment on the loan but I’m hesitant because of the loan forgiveness aspect.  I just feel like there has to be a sweet spot of loan repayment under this plan and I’m not sure what it is or if it even exists. How do I spend the least amount of money to repay this loan?",finance,1405702272

personalfinance,Should I be doing something more with the money I'm saving for taxes? (1099-MISC work),"Hello!

I'm an independent contractor, and as such, I have to save money from each check that I get to pay my federal taxes at the end of every year.

I've been dumping that money into a savings account at the end of every month for the past couple of years, but I'm beginning to think that there is a better opportunity out there for it.  Should I be putting this stuff in CDs or money markets instead?  Something else?  Can I add to funds to CDs/Money Markets as I have them, or would I need to open a new account every couple of months?

(I'm aware that I'm SUPPOSED to make estimated payments every quarter, but the IRS fee for not doing that is small enough that it seems worth having access to the money in the event that something exceptionally drastic happens instead.)

personalfinance,Advice on paying student loan vs. building savings?,"I have just over $28k in student loans that never seems to decrease month-to-month because of a 9% interest rate that I have with Wells Fargo. It used to be through Sallie Mae before I consolidated, where the interest was almost 20%.

I've been focused on paying off my credit card debt first so I've only been making the minimum payment every month to WF. I'm finally within a few hundred dollars of being CC debt free, and my parents' money manager told me to start building my savings account and continue putting just the minimum payment to WF every month.

Is this good advice? I'd like to have some savings to buy my own place, but does it make sense to do that if I still have that $28k in debt that just sits growing interest? Should I just focus on paying the loan off first before really saving? Alternatively, does anyone know of other options out there that could lower my current interest rate?

Hoping someone could help. I went to the money manager first, but something about his advice didn't sit well with me. Second opinion would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",finance,1405714494

--------------------------

After putting a modest amount into retirement I end up with **S2314.48** take home per month.

Bills are:

Mortgage - $869.70

Truck loan - $236.46

Vehicle Insurance - $172.70

Cell - $82.06

Netflix - $8.99

Student loans $190.21

Gym $10

Internet $42

Gas/Electric $130

Water/Sewage $20

**$1751.12** a month. Then $180 a month for gas leaves me with **$403.36** for groceries and other necessities. 

-----------------------------


I have two vehicles which I am prepping to sell the 'fun' car hopefully next week. I expect to get 10k for it. I will use this to pay off the S7648.42 I owe on the truck @ 5.49%.  I have to fix it this week and get her ready to go hopefully by Thursday.

I took time off school so that's why my payments kicked in, I wasn't trying to pay them down in an out of sight out of mind fashion. I will be back in school in the fall at part time so my loans will not be due but I will be taking more out. 

I actually have a good job that I love but I don't get the pay I should. I'm a tech director with good amount of experience. I did negotiate for them to pay a little bit towards tuition which I need to not just blow... In two years when i'm done I should be able to land 20-30k more ( I hope).

--------------
Anyway here's my current student loan break down. (As soon my car is sold I will pay off the $311.23 one)

Sallie Mae fed loan 7.25%          $311.23                   
Sallie Mae fed loan 7.25%          $2,201.60

myfedloan DLUNST 6.80%          $4,614.50     

Total Student Loan Debt: **$13,534.99** 

----------------------------

So the good is I have zero credit card debt. I also owe a few people a rough total of 300 that I will take care of next pay check. Lost my ID/Wallet at a bad time a couple weeks ago... (Super important to take care of)

I have already cut cable and got some of my bills down. I really want to get a solid emergency fund/savings going for life. Right now it's live like I can't spare a dime.

I'm going to do the envelop system with $180 for gas starting on the first of the month. Then $250 for food in another envelop.

ones that are actually worth something everyone is saying it's a bullish market for them/don't sell. Those are ODP and C. Going to sell the Office depot after school starts (acting like I know what I'm doing) 

I have another stock that's a complete loss. I'm trying to figure out what to do with it. I got 200 shares of DEAR that's literally worth 22 cents. To sell it would cost 9.99 so I'm trying to learn about how affects my taxes.

personalfinance,Trying to get a mortgage and found out about an old charge-off/collection. Need advice on how to handle.,"My wife and I are looking to buy a house. We applied and found out that my wife still has an old charge-off/collection from 2010 showing on her credit report. I spoke with our potential mortgage company, and they said that in order to proceed with the application, it would have to get taken care of. Little back story. My wife was married previously. When her and her ex-husband divorced, her financial situation fell apart. She could no longer make payments on her auto which was financed with United Federal Credit Union. Her checking account was also through United and the payment was auto-drafted. The end result was her checking account ended up overdrawn $600 and they repossessed the car and auctioned it. This resulted in a deficiency of $4412.57 that was charged off and sold to Evergreen (collector). My wife called Evergreen to try and start the process of negotiating a settlement. They told her the following. They will accept: $4444.57 ----and the account will be closed $4060.46-----paid in full $3530.05-----settled in full He said that most lenders will not accept settled in full He said he could try to knock it in half but it would only be considered settled. The account will not be marked as closed. We can't afford to pay this amount, especially on a debt that is nearing it's SOL (We are in Arkansas where it is 5 years). We could use advice on someone who has gone through something similar because we don't know how to proceed. We can afford to pay a lump sum of $1,100-$1,300 which is 25-30% of the original balance, but don't want to do that if it won't end up helping our situation as it would deplete our down payment fund on the house.

Bitcoin,"Lawksy's new regulations highlight the twin futures of Cryptocurrency. Whether you advocate for surveillance or fear it, we're all getting what we want.","The more things change, the more they stay the same.  

&gt;""I'm very excited about what the future could hold for this very powerful technology."" 

Writes /u/BenLawsky, on bitcoin, [4 months ago in his AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ygcil/as_requested_im_ben_lawsky_superintendent_of_the/)

He also writes: 
&gt;""We're hopeful that clear regulations, if done in a smart, modern way, may incentivize some of these exchanges to come ashore (hopefully here in NY).""

These are the words of a man eager to capitalize on the benefits of a new technology.  Bitcoin has existed in a somewhat legal grey area, but Lawsky thinks if he can clarify a regulatory landscape then it will remove any uneasiness that interested but hesitant corporations have shown to adopting bitcoin.  

In the same AMA where the word ""Laundering"" was mentioned 263 times, Lawsky was quick to lay out his own agenda on the issue.  He's a regulator who staunchly believes that extensive KYC/AML policies will help stamp out terrorism and other forms of financial crime.  Transactions need to be tracked in Lawsky's world, and he's more than willing to force the entire population to submit to that maxim in order to catch a few bad guys.  He and others have been barking up the paper trail tree for a very long time, and there's nothing to suggest they will ever stop.  

Regulatory clarity is an idea that makes sense on paper at least, and it will cause legitimate well-funded exchanges to spring up that submit to these extensive, and expensive, compliance checks.  It will go on to cause 50 different U.S. states to create 50 different nuanced compliance schemes that each exchange will have to take into account.  Such is the cost of doing business in the U.S. And yes, it will absolutely drive some business out of the US entirely and cause others to forbid american customers from participating.  

It's also worth noting that Lawsky is attempting to prevent another MtGox fiasco by forcing companies that hold customers' bitcoin to provide adequate security measures, keep collateral on hand that effectively insures the deposits, and prevent them from holding any profit in bitcoin.  

Bravo Mr. Lawsky.  You can have your little regulated corner of the world, and the rest of us will be living in ours.  

This is simply not the future of bitcoin.  No one asks you for anything when downloading a wallet for yourself.  No one asks for your permission, background information, or intentions when moving funds from one address to another.  No one can freeze or seize the funds in an address you control.  The type of rules being proposed here are the last bastion of federated economy attempting to impose control with the best of intentions.  But it's exactly those intentions that will drive virtual currency usage away from government influence. 

The truth is that effective money laundering control is impossible in the virtual currency world.  Broad and intrusive regulation might catch some of the low hanging fruit at licensed exchanges, but users who are determined to skirt the rules can and will find ways around it, and many already have.  While institutions and investors are busy sinking enormous sums of capital into the digital economy, others are busy setting up decentralized exchanges and services that fly free of regulatory scrutiny.  

In Lawsky's eyes such activity might look like the golden age of piracy again, but this time it's largely a body of good actors operating under the banner of financial privacy.  This is a group that is simply fed up with the big brother state.  It does not trust 3rd parties, let alone their own government, to own and scrutinize their spending habits

Every modicum of value that enters the virtual currency ecosystem, even through well-regulated and compliant exchanges, increases the effectiveness of a system that operates entirely independent from this scrutiny.  On a fundamental level Lawsky and I may agree that terrorism is heinous, but the days when we can trace financial transactions with any certainty are coming to a close.   It's a hard pill to swallow, and it probably won't stop regulators from trying to clamp down extensively, but they're going to have to find other means to nab criminals who are engaging in harmful activities.  And no, I don't mean more KYC/AML, I'll repeat this again: the more you try to push down on transaction tracking, the less effective it will be.

I firmly believe that virtual currency in some form, is here to stay, it's foolish to dismiss this.  It's equally as foolish to think that all fiat currency may crumble overnight or become obsolete.  Perhaps one may win over the other someday, but we're bound to see a lot of resistance to the death of either system and they will be living in tandem for a very long time.   Lawsky and the regulators may claim some domain over the fiat world and transition points that convert between bitcoin and cash, but the time is quickly approaching when one is able to depart from the fiat world, and never return again.",cryptocurrency,1405718850
Bitcoin,Bitcoin/technology exposing our broken tax code,"Bitcoin/technology is going to be overwhelmingly impossible to regulate not just in this country but in others. This is the first true currency that knows no borders. When the gov says they want to regulate...what they really want is the tax revenue. However, the tax code is so broke and centralized to protect those at the top, they are only collecting such a small percent of whats due. 

I believe bitcoin/technology is going to further expose this weakness and encourage reform with a simple national sales tax...scrapping the existing system full of deductions, loopholes, and ambiguous code. Then the gov can collect from the money launders, drug dealers, terrorists, etc. it does not matter where your bitcoins are or how many you transfer to buy a stick of cheese or a new yacht. As a result...more tax rev, less regulations, smaller IRS, smaller fed reserve, less lawyers, less accountants, etc.. Most importantly less power to the banks who have received astronomical bailouts and and a smaller less empowered gov. Otherwise the gov will continue to chase their tails collecting such a small percentage of tax rev due to them. 

As bitcoin/tech continues to move forward at a dizzying pace it is going to be very difficult for large entities to keep up such as the gov and banks. This technology is going to crush the big banks revenue...remittances, merchant services, acct deposits, etc. and there is not a damn thing they can do.

I figure I will be here the next 10-20 years, so why not? I am done renting apartments. I hate close neighbors and I want a yard that I can take care of. I can spend a max of $600 a month mortgage, and the house I've had my eye on for the past few months just dropped in price, making it almost $350 a month (After insurance and what not.) And my boyfriend will be there with me also paying me. 


So they run my credit report. 26 inquiries in a month!!!!!! All with random banks for car loans. I had NO idea they sent it to that many places.

Incidentals: $100 (odd, rare purchases like shoes, tire rotation, etc.)

I'm going blitz through my private student loans in 9 months starting in Sept, which will be about $1,200 a month for that time giving me about $300 to make minimum payments on federal student loans, all interest, which will be forgiven in 10 years without tax (I work exclusively for nonprofits).

After that time I have a honeymoon period of about 2 years where my brothers will continue to live here (at least, they're in college still at that point and have no intention of moving out) and I won't be paying student loans, where I will have a ton ($1,300) of excess. Do I pay the car off next? Do I save for retirement? I have $2000 in saving, should I save up more? Am I right to pay the loans off before saving?

personalfinance,HELP! Where can I get a 30 day loan for $3000?,"I'm in a horrible place financially. I got sick and missed a fair amount of work right after going on a trip (that I could barely afford). For the first time ever, I decided to take a vacation in a once-in-a-lifetime kind of scenario. It was amazing and well worth it, but I didn't have any emergency funds by the end of it. Now I'm paying for it.



It's been a rough few months, and it's a long and complicated story.The silver lining to the financial stress was that I had $2000 coming to me soon; a friend and I made an investment in January, the company never came through, and its been hell getting our money back. It should have arrived on June 11, which changed to July 11, and when I contacted them after the 11th, they said they needed 30-45 days to process the refund. I'm sure I'll get the money by September, but I needed that $2000 a month ago.



I'll also be receiving ~$3000 in late August. 



I'm 2 months behind on rent. My landlord has been understanding, but expects it paid in full (no penalties thank goodness) August 1. Right now I don't see a way to get that money in time, unless this 2k comes in early. Even then, right now, 2k wouldn't be enough. All my credit cards are maxed, and I have $0 in the bank. I have nothing to pay even minimum balances on. 



I got on food stamps. I walk or bike to work, wasting no money on gas.



In ~30 days from now I'll be sitting fine. That 3k would pay back rent and most of my debts, and the 2k will pay all debts and put me in a comfortable place. I am also working 40+hrs to make up for the time lost, and within a month everything will really just be back to normal. I'm usually quite stable financially, took a few too many risks, and really lost this time.



All HELL has broken loose. I have no family, no support, no one to ask for help. I went to the bank and they were quite unhelpful. I took what they offered (a small personal loan), but with no cosigner it just isn't enough. My credit looks like hell from the past few months of accuring debt, and I had a $16 collection put on my report. WTF. My score is a 680, but with the debt and the new collection, my bank just wouldn't do much for me.



Last week I caved and got a short term loan via some shifty online application, at a horrible interest rate. I received $400, and will have to pay back $530 by the end of the month, or risk gaining more interest. I absolutely needed the cash for food (didn't have food stamps until 2 days ago). This was my last resort, and I really can't handle the idea of using this service any more. 



I'm selling everything I reasonably can - I'd sell my car, but it's only worth ~$1500, and its worth a lot more to me than it is in cash. It really wouldn't be smart to sell it, as I do need a car now and then. No one will give me a title loan on it though, since its old and pretty worthless.

I just accepted an unsubsidized loan for $20,500 to cover tuition for graduate school. Tuition for 2 years will be just over $16,000 plus the cost of textbooks and any fees. I was considering using the remaining amount to pay off the credit card with highest interest rate and start making payments on the student loan early, as soon as credit card debt is paid off. This of course is counter-intuitive but the way I see it is consolidating the debt with a much lower (about 6%) interest rate.

personalfinance,"$40,000 student loans/working hourly job for $10.75/trying to move out of negative environment. Need help.","Hey everyone.
I'm a 23 year-old college student who has a year-and-a-half left of school. Currently, I'm struggling to make ends meet. I live with just my parents and I and, during the school year, I reside on campus. I have been working at a grocery store for three years this coming August, and while they are treating me well (I make $10.75/hour and I work 35-36 hours a week during the summer and they work around school), I find myself unhappy because I am not building a career here. I'm going to school to be a writer and Creative Writing teacher and eventually professor. I'd rather be working in my field with an internship or a job that is paying more because it would help me pay off my debts. I would rather work full-time, have off on weekends, and enjoy my twenties. In order to make decent money a year ago, I was working three jobs and full-time school. 

Money has always been tight for my parents being that my dad lost his job three times over the course of ten years and there hasn't been much stability and so, they do not aid me when I need extra help. I have $40,000 dollars worth of student loans so far in my senior year at my school after transferring from community college and live paycheck to paycheck at the moment. The benefit is that being I'm still in school, the loans don't need to be paid immediately, however, I would like to start building savings now to help achieve that and get myself moved out of my parent's depression and worrisome environment.

After I finish school this year, I am looking to move out of the house into either a single room of a house or an actual apartment because things in my house have become overwhelming. It's no longer mentally conducive to my health. My mom is a very emotionally abusive woman, and it's been affecting me drastically as well placing me into depression. I get anxious all the time with heart palpitations it feels like. She's controlling my finances, I am not allowed to go places, and she demeans me about finances and responsibility all the time, regardless of me holding a job and never resorting to any drug or alcohol as an escape. I can't continue to feel ashamed of myself, when I know I have a lot more to offer. However, it's hard to convince myself that when my mom ambushes me everyday. When I'm on my own at campus and independent somewhat, I feel like a completely different person. 

In terms of bills, I pay my own car insurance, phone bill, I take private voice lessons only during the summer, and gas money/traveling expenses. I'm essentially financially independent but without the funds to do so. I have a motorcycle I bought two years ago, and recently was thinking about selling it, which might help bring me back to a somewhat stable position again. I can get about $4,500 for it.

Here is a breakdown of my monthly bills:
During Summer (June to August) I make about $290/week (roughly 1160/month)
And during the school year (Sept to May) $180/week ($720/month)
Car insurance: $200
Phone bill: $55
Gas:$180
Food: (only for eating out, my parents pay for food) roughly $200-250/month for entertainment and fun (I have to cut this number, I understand)
The Federal PLUS loans will be two separate loans each $24,000 with a fee of 4.288%

I was also recently hit with a lot of past traffic violation fines which ate up my money a lot, so I'm essentially starting this month off at a clean slate (to give perspective).

personalfinance,Paying off my $220k mortgage is my #1 priority... is that sensible? (AU),"I am 22 years old, currently studying and working part-time in a job I've had for 4 years. I earn approximately $450 per week after tax, plus make a bit extra (maybe $5k per year) on freelance graphic design. I have no other debt but also no other assets. I am wondering if I am wise in directing every possible cent to my mortgage as I have read some articles to the contrary.

My grandparents decided (instead of an inheritance) to give me $100,000, but not all at once. As a result I purchased a $275,000 property (including stamp duty) with my parents as guarantors. I made this decision as my parents live in the country and therefore I was renting in the city near university anyway. I put down a $55,000 deposit leaving me with a $220,000 mortgage. With the remaining money from my ""inheritance"", my grandparents are paying my mortgage until I graduate in early 2016. The minimum repayment is $300pw and the interest rate is 5.5%. I am comfortable that even in the event that I do not get a graduate job, I can pay this with the help of housemates + my current job.

In addition, I have previously contributed $100 per week and have two housemates - one paying $150pw (my boyfriend) and one $200pw. 

Usually I have put $150 pw into ""long term savings"" however I have now decided to direct this to my mortgage payments instead. Therefore I am paying an extra $250 per week on the mortgage as well as what my housemates are paying. In total therefore I am paying off $900 pw on the mortgage.

This leaves me with ample to pay for groceries, bills, etc. I don't spend a huge amount of money but I do wish to visit my boyfriend's family who live overseas (and I have never met) at the end of this year which is where anything ""left over"" from living expenses is going. That will cost me about $4,000 but I think is unavoidable.

There are no penalties with the bank for paying the mortgage off earlier and I can withdraw ""overpayments"" at any time (in bundles of $500).

My question is, I have been reading that some sites advise AGAINST paying off your mortgage too quickly. This seems odd to me. I just want to be ""free"" from the mortgage as soon as possible. That said, I am 100% aware of what an incredible gift I have been given with this money and want to use it to set myself up for life and not reflect on it and wish I'd used it differently.

So... am I doing the right thing in paying back ASAP? Or should I be thinking differently in order to maximise the benefit of this money?

personalfinance,"Mortgage with no credit, and co-signer? American mortgage for foreign property?","This is sort of complicated so I will try to be as to-the-point as I can.

Me: American citizen living in Sweden

Fiancee: Swedish citizen

She and I are considering taking over her parents' house in 6-7 months. They're old and having trouble keeping up the place, and their financial situation is tight (not delinquent on payments but starting to tire from never having money to enjoy now in their retirement). They've owned the house 16 years and have a small chunk left on their mortgage balance.

What we want to do is skip the realtor/formalities and just do all the paperwork ourselves, and pay my in-laws $150,000 (the house is worth more than that), which they will then use to pay off the balance on the mortgage and they use the remainder to find a smaller/less expensive place.

(((Just as a PSA: I don't like the idea of low-balling my in-laws but this is the best scenario for them. If they were to put the house on the market they would have soooooo many things to fix to get it past inspection, they probably wouldn't have much left after paying the balance on the mortgage. Not to mention that it would take 6+ months minimum to get interested potential buyers. FIL doesn't have the time or money to do all necessary, and neither he nor MIL are in the greatest of health. I have time, and fiancee loves the house too much to see it go to someone else.)))

We make roughly 85K a year combined. 

We could try to take a mortgage in Sweden but we would be required to put *at minimum* 20% down and the interest rates are just insane (plus most banks are hesitant to lend to a buyer working without a realtor). American banks seem to be offering much better options (including fixed interest, which our Swedish bank does not, and I feel is **VERY** important if we are going to be taking on a cost this big). I am a member of a credit union offering 2.5% fixed interest, that is unheard of in Sweden.

We have no debt (no cars, student loans, or credit cards). We have always been the types to save for what we want, not rely on credit/pay-as-you-go/debt. As a result I have never owned a credit card in America and have a non-existent credit score. I have applied for a secured card to remedy the situation. Hopefully 6 months of use will have some positive effect, right? In any case my stepfather is willing to co-sign on a mortgage with me if my lack of credit is still an issue in January. He has great credit and high income, the broker should love him.

personalfinance,Starting a life with SO on public interest salaries,"Hi PF. I just graduated from law school and will be working in government at a starting salary of ~50-55k. It's a job with good long-term security, which if I love it enough to stay in for a while, will top out at around 110-120k. The job is in the Twin Cities, my home area, with relatively low cost of living. 

**Debt**: I have a debt -- a lot of it: ~240k in federal loans for law school. With the federal IBR program, my law schools public service loan-repayment assistance program, and the fed's PSLF program, I expect to have to pay virtually none of these monthly payments for 10 years, upon which the entire figure will be forgiven without any tax penalty. In short, if I keep my public interest job, I'm not worried about paying off my loans, but I don't know to what extent this number affects my eligibility for credit or buying a house down the line.

**The SO**: A year out of college; has worked a 40k salary job in CA for a year and will continue for just one more year before moving across the country to the Twin Cities with me, with grad school on the horizon. Has zero debt except monthly car payments. Her grandparents have generously offered to fund her grad school ambitions.

**Savings/Assets:** I have 7k in savings locked down, ready to put towards a modest car. Expecting to put it down on the first payment of a 15-20k used Honda/Toyota/Subaru. I will be entering into a pretty good state benefits system, with great health insurance plan, a decent pension and deferred compensation plan. 

As for her, she has a small car she bought into last year and expects to make it last for a long time. She also has about 4-5k saved in the bank, hoping to raise it up to about 10k by next summer and not having to blow all of it on the wedding.

**Future planned expenses:** Well, we've got the wedding coming up. Her parents are taking care of a pretty big chunk, and mine are trying to mop up most of the rest. We're not going lavish with it.

**Ambitions:** SO plans on working for nonprofits, likely with salaries that start anywhere from 30-50k, after grad school. We both know there are more lucrative things we could be doing, but that's not for us. Very carefully turned down opportunities to work at corporate law firms, and if I ever considered that line of work, it would ideally be in 10+ years, after I've gotten my federal student debt forgiven.

**Kids?** Plan is to come back to this question in five years. I want her to be established in her field before we have a kid. It's silly to plan in any details right now, but we wouldn't want more than one or two.

**My questions:** Just typing this out, I realize there are some up-in-the-air variables at this point. She won't be earning a true income if she's starting grad school a year from now. So for our purposes let's say there's a reasonable chance that two years from now we'll be looking at a combined marital income of 90-100k.

So:

1. What are some safe options we should look into for savings? We're both in our early-to-mid twenties right now, so I figure we have some room to have some fun without compromising our retirement. We're also low-key people, though, so we don't have problems with putting a lot of it away off the bat.

2. What's all this about putting into a house? If we consider moving back to her homestate of California in 5-10 years, is it wise to buy into a house in Minnesota anytime soon?

Questions/Thoughts/Notes
•	No kids, no plans to have kids.  
•	Accelerate paying off the car just to clear the debt, or carry on with the payments?  Inclined to keep the car payments as-is and focus extra money on mortgage / savings.  
•	Considering splitting the emergency fund up into three cds (10k, 5k and 5k).  The savings account is at .75%, current cd is at .9%.  Would splitting the funds eliminate the benefit of the higher interest rate?  Thought behind splitting it is that if we only need 5k, we can just close out one cd and not have any losses on the other 15k in separate cds.
•	Retirement balances for our age (33/34) feel woefully low.  We have been dropping our expenses to put more in retirement.  Have upped her 401k contribution from 4% to 10% and his from 0 to 6% in the past six months.  His will go to 10% this month.  Will continue bumping up.  30% of her bonuses go to 401k and she gets an annual profit sharing bonus as well, approximately $2,000.  
•	We were putting a lot of savings into the emergency fund but have slowed down.  I still put $100 per month towards it.  We would need $4,200/month to bare minimum survive with our debt and necessities right now, so the emergency fund is at 4.5 months, with which I’m pretty comfortable.  In a serious emergency we could also potentially rent out up to 2 bedrooms of our house for some extra income (probably could get at least $500 each).  
•	Her old and new 401k accounts, and possibly the SEPIra will be rolled together probably in January.  Currently have no control over the allocation on the new one (it’s entirely in one fund) and no access to it except for an annual statement; just not comfortable rolling the old one into that situation.

politics,"Currency, regulation, inflation, effort, and time: Is someone else is determining how much your life is worth?","So, I've worked on this a little bit since the last time I wrote about it. If you read it last time, just ignore it.

**""Time is money.""**

 - a phrase used by Benjamin Franklin in *Advice to a Young Tradesman*

*Preface: I'm going to tie this back to politics, I swear. First off; this is not a conspiracy theory. I don't believe some shadow government has put this into effect. This is just a running analysis of how global economics affects individual lives, and the effect that politics has on that. This is something I've been musing about recently, and wanted to place it somewhere in a structured manner for some criticism. I know there are gigantic holes, citations needed, and other things here, but I'm just going to freight-train through it in hopes that it'll spark some useful thinking and discussion. I'd love it anyone has additions to this.*

**Time as money**

The reverse is also true. A currency unit is a physically tangible manifestation someone's time and effort spent to earn it. It is, quite simply, something that someone gives you so that you will spend your time doing what they want you to do. You desire it so that you may determine that others spend their time in a way that benefits you. You use this token to encourage farmers to grow your food, tailors to sew your clothes, and artists to produce works that you enjoy. 

**Time as power**

The physical currency unit is a result of society recognizing the only tradeable commodity that is intrinsic to every human: human effort. This is why slavery has existed since the dawn of man; controlling the time of others is the only true form of power; wealth means nothing if you cannot use it to change the behavior of other people, and why wage-slavery is an enormous issue in the world today. For some, the 'change' that owners of currency are seeking to influence may be as simple as the desire to possess objects that others have spent time crafting. For more sinister types, there are ideological ramifications.


**Time as punishment**

Time-theft is considered to be the ultimate crime; it's often referred to by the more popular nomenclature: murder. Incarceration is often considered one of the worst forms of punishment. Not only are they determining how (physically) you spend your time, but the punishing entity is training the confined party to spend their time in certain ways in the future. 

**Time, politics, and large numbers**

**Politics:** ""The activities associated with the governance of a country or other area, specifically relating to the the debate or conflict arising around the delegation and dissemination of funds and assets."" Politics is, as my professor once stated: ""Quite simply the process of deciding 'who gets what', and shouldn't be viewed as anything more."" I feel that's very accurate.

**Large numbers:** To talk about the immense amount of units that some specific people control, we have to understand large numbers, and how futile even the largest of grassroots efforts are in comparison. To quote from ehd.org's 'Grasping Large Numbers' article:^[1](http://www.ehd.org/science_technology_largenumbers.php)

&gt;Whether describing the vastness of the stars or the microscopic intricacies of the human body, the need to use large numbers is often inevitable. When we consider the estimated 200,000,000,000 (200 billion) stars in the Milky Way Galaxy or the estimated 150,000,000,000 (150 billion) galaxies in the universe or the estimated 100,000,000,000,000 (100 trillion) cells in the adult human body, we are forced to use numbers so large we cannot comprehend their meaning.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 100 one dollar bills measures .43 inches.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 1,000,000 one dollar bills measures 4,300 inches or 358 feet – about the height of a 30 to 35 story building.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 1,000,000,000 (one billion) one dollar bills measures 358,510 feet or 67.9 miles. This would reach blue sky: all the way from the earth’s surface into the lower portion of the troposphere – one of the major outer layers of earth’s atmosphere.

&gt;* The height of a stack of 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) one dollar bills measures 67,866 miles. This would reach more than one fourth the way from the earth to the moon.

Now, to discuss real numbers; the 2012 combined actualized national budget for the USA was $3.538^[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_federal_budget) *trillion dollars*.  Stacked one-dollar bills would reach over *four hundred and fifty five thousand miles*, or quite close to the distance from the earth to the moon. The total deficit (translation: taxpayers time that's already been spent) was $16.05 Trillion,^2 which would stack up to well over four times the distance to the moon, using one dollar bills

**One unit of currency is how much time?**

This is where it gets interesting to me. Who's time? The current (hopefully to go up soon, anyone?) federal minimum wage in the USA is $7.25. For a minimum wage employee, it takes 8 1/3 (ish) minutes to make one dollar. In Uganda,^[3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country) it would take a minimum wage worker over *two and a half weeks* to make one US dollar. 

**How much time are we talking about?**

The total sway of the US government's 2012 federal budget in 'US minimum wage worker hours' is 491,192,333,333.33 hours. That's 491.19 billion hours. Or, 56,035,019.39 years, if that's easier to wrap brains around. The federal government has that many man-years at it's disposal each year. 

I'm not even going to calculate that in Ugandan time to earning power ratio.

**The third world employee: post-scarcity, corruption, and corporate imperialism**

I have a theory. I believe that we are already living in what is essentially a post-scarcity world. 

I think that you'll find a common thread in every undeveloped or developing country; you'll find a few powerful individuals at the top who have total control; whether this be religious control (middle east),  control over natural resources (South America), or control by threat of violence. (Africa, North Korea) 

You'll also find exploration from outside the country by gigantic conglomerations of individuals who are bound together in one, and only one legally binding and life-threatening purpose: profit. We commonly refer to these entities as multi-national corporations, and this practice is regularly called 'outsourcing'. 

To be frank, I believe that currency is control. It controls the producers in undeveloped countries, while the much higher values and prices of people's effort in developed nations help keep the accessibility to power (the ability to determine how other people's time is spent) for all but a few to an absolute minimum.

**Currency markets, inflation, and interest**

Any non-representative currency is directly controlled by the issuer. They determine the interest rates of loans between central banks and treasuries, thereby controlling supply and inflation. 

The most poignant tool the issuer has, and the one it most often employs, trading of government securities open market operations. This allows almost direct control over how much 'time' (purchasing power) each unit has. 

Another tactic for determining the availability and potency of currency is a practice where the issuer buys treasury bonds, and then sells them back for more or less than they paid for them, effectively creating more available currency without actually issuing more. This is often where deficit numbers will change without any immediate explanation. This can make an administration look favorable in the eyes of constituents, even if the reality of the numbers tells a different story. We've seen this in the US in the last two years of the current administration.^[4](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TREAST)

**A few things that I've been wondering:**

* **Is our standard of living in western 'first world' nations propped up on the suffering of others?**

* **Why are we OK with an external force controlling the trading value of our time?**

* **Is there *anything* we, as individuals can actually do about this global wage-slavery/time-theft system?**

Questions/Thoughts/Notes

* No kids, no plans to have kids.  

* Accelerate paying off the car just to clear the debt, or carry on with the payments?  Inclined to keep the car payments as-is and focus extra money on mortgage / savings.  

* Considering splitting the emergency fund up into three cds (10k, 5k and 5k).  The savings account is at .75%, current cd is at .9%.  Would splitting the funds eliminate the benefit of the higher interest rate?  Thought behind splitting it is that if we only need 5k, we can just close out one cd and not have any losses on the other 15k in separate cds.

* Retirement balances for our age (33/34) feel woefully low.  We have been dropping our expenses to put more in retirement.  Have upped her 401k contribution from 4% to 10% and his from 0 to 6% in the past six months.  His will go to 10% this month.  Will continue bumping up.  30% of her bonuses go to 401k and she gets an annual profit sharing bonus as well, approximately $2,000.  

* We were putting a lot of savings into the emergency fund but have slowed down.  I still put $100 per month towards it.  We would need $4,200/month to bare minimum survive with our debt and necessities right now, so the emergency fund is at 4.5 months, with which I’m pretty comfortable.  In a serious emergency we could also potentially rent out up to 2 bedrooms of our house for some extra income (probably could get at least $500 each). 
 
* Her old and new 401k accounts, and possibly the SEPIra will be rolled together probably in January.  Currently have no control over the allocation on the new one (it’s entirely in one fund) and no access to it except for an annual statement; just not comfortable rolling the old one into that situation.  But, that should change in January. 

* He wants to replace the Accord with a Tesla Model 3 around when they come out (2017 ish).  His drive to work is about 15 miles round trip and we will be plugging it into our house, which has solar panels, to charge.  That'll cost less than his gas is now to operate it.  Will probably have to be bought new, good luck finding a used Tesla.  They're supposed to start around $35,000.  How best to save for that?  Barring it being wrecked, we'll probably sell the Accord and put that towards it too (assuming we can get maybe $5,000 for it at that point, it will still be under 100,000 miles most likely).",finance,1405787199
Bitcoin,"By far, THIS is the most damning part of the ""BitLicense.""","Unless you're a Winklevii, most in the community seem to agree that the BitLicense regulation proposals are archaic, and that it will hinder startup growth, etc.

The most important point that people seem to overlook is this piece of regulation, section 200.8(b):

Each Licensee shall be permitted to invest its retained earnings and profits in **only** the following high-quality, investment-grade permissible investments with maturities of up to one year and **denominated in United States dollars**:

(1) certificates of deposit issued by financial institutions that are regulated by a United States federal or state regulatory agency; 

(2) money market funds; 

(3) state or municipal bonds; 

(4) United States government securities; 

(5) United States government agency securities

BitLicense businesses cannot invest or hold their ANY of their profit in Bitcoin, ONLY in US Dollars.

You will be told this regulation is to protect the business (and therefore, its consumers) from Bitcoin exchange rate fluctations, but if Bitcoin businesses are forbidden from holding their profits Bitcoin, then what are those businesses forced to do?

Sell their Bitcoin - driving down prices, reducing demand.

This part of the regulation has one purpose, and that is to prevent the rise of Bitcoin as a reserve currency. **It simply makes no sense that a BITCOIN BUSINESS cannot hold ANY of its earnings in Bitcoin.**

This was written by the banks, for the banks. Don't support it, and don't be blinded by the ""This is actually good news!"" mentality. It's not, unless you're looking forward to JPMorganCoin.

personalfinance,Increased Income-- Planning debt repayment and investing. Advice?,"We'll have some significant increases to income between raises and my wife returning to work next month, and I wanted to get some opinions on how best to handle a few things.  I know that quite a few pieces have been covered in the FAQs, but there's enough moving parts that I'd like to get a few opinions on how I should approach things.

My wife is returning to work next month.  She'll be working a weekend shift that pays almost as much as full time work, but with this shift we're able to avoid childcare for our two young children.

**Monthly Income (Net- $12k):**

Me: $9300 (including bonus averaged out throughout the year)

Wife: $2700 (beginning next month).

**Monthly Expenses (some as budgeted, some average over the past year)- $2,763:**

* Electric (incl. Heat)/Gas/Water/Sewer: $400
* Gasoline: $400 (live 30-40 minutes away from jobs)
* Groceries: $600 (incl. diapers, formula, etc)
* Cell Phone: $62
* Car Insurance: $95
* Pet Supplies: $60
* Internet: $68 (options in this aren't great to say the least)
* Local Taxes (occupational + per capita): $78
* Misc. (Dining out, toys, clothing, everything else): $1000

**Loans and Payments ($2,930/mo):**

* Federal Student Loan: $29,221@ 5.75% fixed.  $189/mo
* Private Student Loan: $5,747 @ 3.49% variable.  $55/mo
* Wife's Perkins Loan: $2,060 @ 5.0% fixed.  $40/mo (some balance forgiven from my wife working as a nurse full time before our kids came along, additional balance could be forgiven if she returns full time.  That's not likely to happen for several years.
* Car Loan #1: $19,567 @ 2.49% fixed.  $550/mo
* Car Loan #2: $47,830 @ 2.99% fixed.  $800/mo.  (This was obviously a terrible idea)
* Mortgage: $175,751 @ 5.0% fixed and no PMI.  $1012 for P&amp;I, $1296 including tax &amp; insurance escrow)

**Other considerations:**

* Wife and I are in our late 20s.
* 401k: $47k (contributing up to company match-- 4% contribution rate)
* Emergency Fund/Checking account Buffer: $4k-- just wiped out the rest of the emergency fund on a new heat pump/central air unit.  Old central air unit was 30 years old and died.  Hoping that a heat pump saves on the electric bills (vs. electric baseboard heat)
* Will probably owe $15k extra in taxes related to a significant employee stock grant award later this year.
* Have some stock in my employer (privately held) and more coming as noted above.  There have been liquidity events in the past that I've participated in, and it's probably 2-3 years until the next one.  Total value of stock at that point is likely to be significant.  I'm planning as if it's worthless though since it's not liquid now and some of it is still subject to vesting.
* Job security-- My job is quite secure for the next 2-4 years.  After that, it's harder to say.  My wife's job security is typical.  Entirely different fields (tech vs. healthcare).

**My current plan and questions:**

If you've followed along this far, you'll see that we should have a significant surplus each month-- over $6k/mo.  I'm trying to decide how to approach building an emergency fund, paying off debt, and investing in tax-advantaged retirement accounts.

Here's what I'm thinking I should do (and the order to do it), but I'd like to hear some thoughts!

1. Save for the tax bill.  I'm not sure how/if this will be withheld, but it's getting paid one way or another.

2. Rebuild ~$10k emergency fund in addition to 1 month checking account buffer.  I'm considering placing this into a Roth IRA (backdoor) ($5500 for me, $5500 for my wife) invested in a money market account (or a bond fund?) in order to not lose the tax-advantaged space without significant risk of the principal.  I'd then save a new emergency fund in a high yield savings account over the next year and then invest the Roth IRA funds into an index fund.  Is this a good idea given my situation?

3.  Pay off federal student loan, then private loan (low rate, but it's variable), then Perkins (could be forgiveable later if wife returns to FT work, but it'll probably be nearly paid off by that point with minimum payments).

I'm not sure what to do next.

Mortgage-- Next highest interest rate is the mortgage.  We'd like to move closer to our jobs to save time and gas.  Loan to value is quite high (~95%).  Thinking that paying down the mortgage a bit would help to enable that.

Car loans-- does it make sense to pay these off early?  Low interest rates on both.  Car #2 was such a terrible thing for us to do, but selling it would be difficult since it's underwater.  I suppose money could be directed here first to make that more possible, but the vehicle would need to be replaced with something much cheaper (we can't reasonably do one car where we live).  Car #2 also has GAP insurance, so if anything happened to it, the loan would be paid.

Increasing 401k contributions-- does it make sense to prioritize increasing 401k contributions over any of the above debt repayment?

personalfinance,"Debt consolidation for two credit cards (CA), good idea?","I have two credit cards with 19% interest totalling $30K. Long story, hit a stretch of bad luck and here we are. I'm making the minimum payments totalling $1000 (all I can afford based on my budget) each month but with such high interest rates, it looks like I am never getting ahead, i was wondering if I should work out a plan through debt consolidation via a debt management company. My credit is unfortunately terrible. Appreciate any advice.",finance,1405790834
finance,Debating on consolidating my two private student loans. Would love some advice.,"I have three loans. The first is a private Chase student loan that I received back in '07 for college. The second is a Sallie Mae private loan I took out in '11 and the other is a federal income based repayment loan I took out in '07. Because my income is evaluated every year for my IBR loan, I have not started paying that back.  

The private loans are the ones that are stifling me. I pay $295.00 (Chase) and $258.00 (Sallie Mae) every month and I have never missed a payment. I have deferred both loans during times of economic hardship, but I have always repaid them when my deferment period ended. 

I lost my job in June and it has thrown me into a phase of self-reflection and low self-esteem. My boss was unnecessarily hurtful and told me that I was incapable of doing anything right, but then told me that he wanted me to consider freelancing for him. It made no sense and the whole thing was extremely unprofessional and since then I've been in limbo with taking the next step. I did not claim unemployment because I received nothing in writing. Since my termination, I've been having doubts about my career and I'm doubting what I'm capable of doing. I've never interviewed for a job I didn't get. I can't imagine walking into an interview with that type of confidence right now. I've just been sitting around spinning wheels, but that's a topic for another subreddit. 

Despite the job loss, I am so fortunate in terms of my living situation. I live in an apartment in the basement of my parent's house (kitchen, living room, bath, bedroom) and my car is paid off. The only two financial responsibilities I have are my student loans, but they've stifled me in terms of moving forward with my life. I don't mind living in this apartment, but I'm reaching an age where I know it's time to move on, but the jobs I've had have only made it possible to pay my loans and slowly, very slowly, save up for my future

As of now, the money I'm using to pay my loans is from a savings account dedicated to a new car (need a new car before I need a new apartment). I had $2,000 saved up when I was let go and since June I've been dipping into that since I don't have any money coming in. 

I don't have a lot of information on loan consolidation, but I know there are a lot of companies out there that prey on people who need to consolidate their debt. I know there are things that I need to do in order to financially bounce back. It begins with pulling my shit together, finding my confidence again, and getting another job, even if it's part time.

I asked Chase if they consolidate loans and they said no. I have not asked Sallie Mae because I have had terrible, terrible, customer service/competence issues with them. What are my options? I'd love some feedback. Thanks so much.",finance,1405791286
personalfinance,403(b) Ripoff?,"I work part time for a non-profit and I just started looking at what options I had within the 403(b). Currently I plan on maxing a Roth IRA every year, and contributing 6% of my salary (salary is about $17,500) to the 403(b) to get the maximum match. I won't be eligible to get the match until next February, so I hadn't looked at the 403(b) until now.

[Imgur](http://imgur.com/qxKlf08)

On top of the expense ratios, there is a 1.1% Net Asset Fee!

Is this as huge of a ripoff as this seems to me to be? I'm assuming the only fund I would want to use is the NWSP500IndxSvc. (Why is its performance so far off the benchmark S&amp;P 500 they show?)

The way I see it, most of these end up with ~2% expense ratio. If I assume 8% growth, and that if I invested in a taxable Vanguard account the expense ratio would be 0.17%, it seems to me that's like trading a 15% Federal capital gains tax for ~25% Nationwide capital gains tax. Or is there something wrong with my thinking?

If this is as bad as it seems like it is to me, I would like to raise my concerns. I just don't want to do that if it's really as good as it gets as far as 403(b)s go. My company is very small, 6 employees, 3 of whom work half time, so maybe this is the best we can get with such a small account? Or maybe I'm just completely wrong and this is actually a good deal?

Is it even worth it for me to contribute to this beyond the match? I'm in the 10% bracket so it seems like I may as well just invest in a taxable account (0% capital gains)? Or should I still try to get as much in as possible so that when I change jobs I can roll it over to something much better?

Bitcoin,Questions for the Bitfinex return swappers out there,"As a lender, is there ANY reason for me to use a fixed rate? It seems to screw over the lender. If rates go down, the borrowers can immediately close their loans and re-buy at a lower rate. And this is about to get even more prominent with the auto-loan bot bitfinex is giving everyone in a few days. If rates go UP, then the borrower gets to stay with their low rate, and the lender can't do anything.

Compare this to lending at the FRR. If average rates go down, the FRR goes down, so borrowers aren't likely to drop their loans for new ones. If rates go UP, borrowers pay the higher interest rate and can't really shop around (fixed rates will be slightly higher than the FRR, which lags(?)).",cryptocurrency,1405801132

I can use one of my parent's cars until I save up for mine. With all this debt, and only about 110 dollars a month in expenses (phone/health insurance/internet) should I pay all my debt first, then save up for my car, or should I do 50/50? The car will cost me about 6k, so the same amount as what I owe. I will buy used, no loan, and I know how to check a car to make sure it's in good condition. Again, interest doesn't matter much as it's only like 20 dollars a month.

I saw an offer thru a company called SoFi and they are offering a 60 month loan at 2.66%.

Would it be worth it to consolidate now or just stay were I am and pay for another four years?  Thanks in advance for any advice that anyone can give me.

So my question is not if I should go with SoFi but rather if it worth it to refinance at all. I would like to shorten the length of my student loans but I am unable to put any more money towards it each month. So I don't know if just refinancing is worth all the trouble or not.",finance,1405811853

My tuition cost per semester including books and fees is about $8,500, I pay rent every month of $500, and then with other living expenses I probably need about $650 per month total. I work almost full-time during school, and can almost definitely handle $650 per month. According to my financial aid office, my federal loans will cover tuition this year, mixture of subsidized and unsubsidized of course.

I have 2 private loans, through Sallie Mae, from Freshman and Sophomore year; $15,000 each year. These two loans are pretty high interest, one is 7% and the other is 11.75%. Parents have horrendous credit, no one else in my family could even qualify to co-sign. Assuming I'll make enough, or almost enough, working part time during the year to pay rent and living costs, should I put most of this $7,500 towards my high interest Sallie Mae debt? I think I would save $1,500 in a type of emergency fund, and put $5,000 towards it. So I'm effectively foregoing paying tuition outright, in an effort to pay down higher interest debt and take on lower interest federal loans. Am I missing anything?


EDIT: Oh! I forgot, this may be important; my parents are making interest-only payments on the 7% Sallie Mae loan while I'm in school. That's all they're able to do but it helps tremendously!",finance,1405820520

politics,Halbig v. Burwell: The Case That Could Blow Open a Gaping Wound in Obamacare,"The case targets the legality of an IRS regulation allowing ACA insurance premium subsidy payments in states that did not establish their own ACA insurance exchange.

Section 1311 of the law allows state governments the option of establishing their own ACA exchange. If a state does not establish such an exchange, section 1321 of ACA authorizes DHHS to establish an ACA exchange in that state.

Elsewhere in the law, the section touching on insurance premium subsidies for policies purchased on an exchange reads that such subsidies are only authorized on exchanges ""established by the State under Section 1311.""

If Halbig prevails, the out-of-pocket cost of premiums for persons purchasing on federal exchanges could skyrocket. The ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is expected soon.

Banking,is this case of an unethical bank behavior or perhaps it's a case of deep fraud network?,"hello reddit, sorry for the formatting i can't increase the space between the paragraphs.

whenever i encounter issue in an area which isn't familiar to me and has many possible interpretations i usually seek for opinions from experienced professionals.

when tackling these issues before i posted on forums and waited for weeks for a reply but now reddit is the first place i come to after googling for answers brings me to a dead-end.

so here's the story. currently i'm helping a client who is a victim of bank wire fraud. he was deceived by receiving spoofed email message telling him to transfer the money in another bank account.

the stolen funds were wired to Royal Bank of Scotland account even thou the initial bank account was from a turkish bank and was owned by my client's business partner.

RBS said the money were transferred again and aren't available for refund anymore. my client wanted to know who took the money so we called the bank to ask for the identity of the holder of the account where the money were transferred to but they said they can't share this info because of data protection law.

they also said they can only reveal this to our local bank which conducted the transfer and that we should tell them to contact RBS. we did this only to receive the same answer. the information can't be shared because of data protection law.

so my question is this: do they really have the right to keep away the information from us, consider we are discussing criminal activities? or perhaps they are trying to discourage us from pursing the information because they could possible be hiding something???

i'm saying this because awhile ago there was an almost identical case where our local bank received an answer saying the money were credited and the bank account was closed. however once we contacted Barclays, which had the destination bank account and asked them, they told us only 600GBP were gone and the rest can be refunded.

this led me to suspect that there could be mole(s) in the bank(s) covering the thief but i don't want to speculate so i would like to know if the behavior i previously described is symptomatic for a fraud network of perhaps it is only a consequence of uninterested/unworried staff members?

police here are very slow and scared of solving crimes so the people are forced to improvise searching the cause. this is why i wrote to the banking sub-forum in hope someone can elaborate more vivid picture for me. if necessary i can provide extensive details for my suspicions which may indicate towards fraud network. thanks.",finance,1405840719
personalfinance,Question about mortgages and investing.,"So, lets say I own a home with no mortgage, and have a job that makes me enough money to live off of with some extra. Can I take out a mortgage with an APR of 4% (hopefully rounding up) and simply reinvest that money into something like index stocks? Are there any legal ramifications to this? Would it be worth it after taxes?

I've just been wondering about this, as it looks like it may be an option for me in the near future.

Thanks for your time!

Edit: Thanks for the info guys! I like the conversation that is going on here, and it seems one of my bigger struggles is that I will be getting a HELOC rather than a new house mortgage, which have higher interest rates. Also the fact that it is simply risky to do, which I knew going in. I do appreciate the advise on here that says it isn't worth the risk (after all, this subreddit IS personal finance, and it makes sense to advise against unnecessary risk). In retrospect, it is good advice for a place like personal finance when a lot of people don't know what they are doing.

My thing is that I am really into the FI/ER movement, and only need something like 300k total to reach my goal. I was just wondering if this strategy was      1. Legal   2. A good investment strategy    3. Going to get me to Financial Independence earlier.

1 is definitely the case, 2 really depends on what your goals are and how much risk you are willing to take, but 3. is where the math gets tricky, and it depends on how well the investments do. For relatively short term gains (if I want to pay off the mortgage in full after 10-15 years) my returns need to be somewhere around 6 percent to be better than simply putting the would be mortgage payments into the market. But, honestly, it is so close at 6% that the risk doesn't seem worth it to me. If anyone has any thoughts on this, I would be open to them.

Thanks for all the help guys!",finance,1405844742

Probably a dumb idea, because he's got a $26,000 loan for 6 years and a 15% interest rate. I've been wanting to refinance mine and his car because the interest rates were ridiculous, but no one seems to want to help me out because my credit score is just now starting to build and it's kinda in the poor status. 

I've also wanted to return my car entirely because my grandmothers credit union has offered to assist with a 1.5% interest rate but when I threatened to hand the car back over they said something about it coming back on my taxes in a 10-901 or some crap like that.

personalfinance,Help me figure out how to move.,"(Edited for weird formatting and to add our take-home pay.)

As young twentysomethings, we bought a house with no money down.  (Geniuses, right?  We were so proud to be the first in our families to own real estate!)  We never intended to live here forever; we bought into an ""up and coming"" neighborhood with very few families and really crappy schools.  We thought we'd go to grad school, build up a little equity, and then sell when we were ready to start our family.

You know how this story goes.  By the time we came out of grad school, the house was underwater, the kids had come early, and we had a lot of debt and a lot of trouble getting jobs.  We applied for HARP but got rejected twice.  So we plugged on, took on more debt.

Now we're doing much better.  We are both employed.  The kids are in public school, but bored as hell.  We bring in more than we spend.  We're almost out of debt.  But we are all absolutely miserable.  We hate city living.  We hate this stupid house.  The kids spend long hours in before- and after-care and they come home exhausted.  

We want to move to a small beach town about four hours away.  The schools are excellent and the cost of living is much, much lower.  Every few months, we break out spreadsheets and calculator and  torture ourselves trying to find a way to make it happen - or even just a timeline for doing it 3-5 years from now, before our oldest starts high school.  I can't figure out a way to make it possible.  I'm feeling so guilty for bringing up my kids like this.  Please, Reddit, help me figure out a plan--or tell me definitively that I'm stuck.  Either way I need to find some peace.

Here's our situation:

TAKE-HOME: 
$5730 ($2956 me, $2774 SO, after taxes, retirement, health &amp; dental premiums)

DEBT:
Public student loans: $561/mo (this is income-based, so the amount is adjusted based on how much we bring in and whether my SO works.  This number could go down per month and the balance will be forgiven in six years, as I work in public service.)

Private student loans: $121/mo (this is the combined minimum payment on three loans.  We've been hitting these hard and now have a combined balance of $11,050 and an interest rate of 3.2%.)

House: The shithole costs us $1691/mo.  We bought it for $180k and owe $171k still, having paid interest-only for years (see, we're geniuses). Zillow estimates it at $215k because of recent home sales, but our most recent assessment was $140k and a realtor we talked to said he could get us maybe $160k for it.   

Car: We own two.  One's paid for and worth $4k.  The other we owe $5500 on and its Bluebook value is $3500. 

Credit Card: We've hit this hard, too, and have gone from over $35k in consumer debt (from our under- and unemployments) to a balance of $4288 and 15.99% interest.  I am waiting on a cashout of last year's PTO, which should knock off this entire balance.  I can't WAIT.

OTHER EXPENSES:

Daycare and school costs: These average $600/mo and the only way to decrease them is for someone to stay home.

Food: We shop at Aldi and cook at home, so our bill averages $85/week for four people and pets.  I can't get it much lower.

Entertainment: This is almost entirely for the kids and I admit that I buy them way too much out of guilt.  We try to keep to a budget of $200/mo, which includes Netflix, outings,  and treats.  We do mostly free things, which is a benefit of living in a city.  Libraries, parks, museums, festivals.  We do pay for a pool, but we're probably going to be cutting that since the kids get to go with daycare and wouldn't be missing out.

Insurance: $85

Phones: $110 (we're switching to Straight Talk once our contract is up.  For now, we're stuck.)

Cars: $280, which includes a monthly payment, and two fill-ups per month, as well as occasional maintenance (we have learned to do the basics on our own, which has helped immensely).

Utilities: Water is $50/mo and electric averages $100/mo.

Internet: $26 every other week ($52/month).  

Miscellany: Co-pays, renewals, and what we call the ""city tax"" (bringing wine to someone's party, and other ""keeping up withe Joneses"" middle-class bullshit) - about $150/mo.

If you've made it this far, thank you.  I'm willing to try just about anything - an extreme commute, building a tiny house, selling plasma.  If you have any ideas about how we can give our kids a better quality of life and education, please let me know.",finance,1405871505

All in all, what I am really looking for here is advice on how I can invest this money now, so that I get the best return when I leave college in a years time. Do I open a Vanguard account and invest the $3,381 in their ETFs? Are there much better options I'm missing?

personalfinance,Need tax shield suggestions under the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT),"My husband and I will be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) this year because we are exercising his company's stock options.  The idea of our plan, and also advised by the accountant, is to take some of the ""tax hit"" now while our income is lower this year and be taxed the remainder of the stock value (the stock is expected to keep increasing in value) as capital gains taxes several years later when the stocks are sold.  The IRS makes you report the ""bargain element"" (the difference between the value of the stock and price you are buying it at) at time of exercise as income even though there is no immediate cash disbursement.  So, our bargain element is a whopping $60,000 (5,000 shares with a $12 discount, so 5,000 x 12).  I ran through a simulation on the 6251 tax form and we're going to end up owing an additional $11,000 on federal taxes, even after we max out the allowed 401K contribution of $17,500.  I am not working so I don't think I can contribute tax free to a retirement fund.  I had thought I could open an IRA and contribute $5,500 but an accountant said it would be post-taxed money put in;  then I may as well open a Roth. I can't find any other tax shields except to increase our donations to charity because we can still itemize deductions.  However, we cannot deduct mortgage interest or personal exemptions (and we're going to have a 2nd baby this fall so no child tax credits).  Any other ideas/suggestions?",finance,1405878988
investing,"Met a ""day trader"" at a party last night. Looking for some input on what he told me about his work","Ok, so I'm at this party last night, and someone asks me what I do.  I tell them I'm an accounting grad student (I have my CMA completed as well).  The guy next to me asks me what type of accounting I want to do, which I find a pleasantly unexpected question, cuz most people think accounting = tax.  So we talk, and I ask him if he's a business person.  He's a younger guy (I'm 27, I'd guess he's around the same age).

He says he's a day trader.  I find this to be pretty cool.  As a typical accounting personality, I'm pretty risk averse.  I figure day-traders are probably the opposite, and I want to know more.

I ask him about his work more, and he mentions he wrote an algorithm and sold it to Fidelity for 80 grand, and still gets royalties.  I am skeptical at this point, but I think it's pretty cool IF it's true.  I ask him what sort of math goes into writing one and he smirks and replies ""not much, really.""  This is kind of surprising to me, I'd always imagined algorithms to be pretty complex.  But I don't know enough to say more.  But I'm thinking ""if algorithms can be written by anyone, why would Fidelity need to pay instead of just having one of their analysts develop one?""

Then I ask what he looks at when making a trade.  He says he likes to see a 5 year overall growth in stock price for companies, and also likes to see stable management (no new CEOs/CFOs for a good year before trading).  This seems reasonable to me, so I ask him what he looks at to determine this.  I'm expecting something like ""oh, I look at board minutes, MD&amp;A, the financials"", that sort of thing.

Nope, this guy apparently only trades off the news.  He scoffed when I asked if he looked at statements of cash flow.

As far as I could tell, he didn't have higher education completed.  He mentioned he was a fireman for a municipality for awhile to save up capital, and now does day-trading full time.

I'm not trying to sound hypocritical or high-handed; but how can someone think they can beat the market consistently by following the news?  I was baffled but tried to not let it show.

I guess my main question is, how likely is it that he was full of shit about the algorithm?

Also, he mentioned that certain companies give him ""cool stuff"" for trading their stocks, which also made zero sense to me.  He couldn't seem to recall which ones though.",finance,1405880765

personalfinance,"I am about $180,000 in debt from student loans and I am desperate for help.","I've been a reddit lurker for almost two years now but decided to finally make a username on the sole purpose of posting to this subreddit for help.

I have a $40,000 federal student loan and a $10,000 private student loan from my bank. I had these loans under an income based repayment plan, so I'm getting by and plan to pay one off in 10 years and the other in 2 years. 

The remaining $130,000 I owe is under my parents' names because I signed up for a Parent Plus loan in college. Making the minimum monthly payments are really getting the best of me. It's my responsibility to pay these loans as my parents and I agreed, but it's difficult because it is not under my name. Because of this, I'm not sure how to apply for lower payments if my income and other loans cannot be considered by the loan company.

I've heard of miracle programs that significantly lower payments (particularly the Obama Loan Forgiveness thing) but when I try to look into it, I'm overwhelmed with the options and have no idea which ones are actually legit or will give me the most benefit. I don't want to just lower my monthly payment minimums if I'll be paying double the loan in interest anyway. I work in a non-profit organization so I think this helps. But will it affect the loan under my parents' names since it's technically not under my name? Which programs are legit and actually work, from your experience? Also, when I asked about the options in lowering payments under the Parent Plus Loan, they said the only way is to consider consolidating it. Is this really the best and only option or was the person on the phone just not as interested in genuinely helping a girl out? I need all the help I can get because, as anyone with any large amount of loans knows, this is extremely crippling and makes it difficult to even plan a future. I feel like my entire income is going into my loans. I'm kind of hoping someone out there who's on the same boat as me or has been and has reached the light at the end of the tunnel will see this and enlighten me with some great options.

Obviously, I am going to want this money to be easy to access if I am going to be using it in a relatively short time period. At the least, I believe that opening an online savings account would be more beneficial than what I am doing now, considering the interest rates are more around the range of 0.70%-0.90%.

personalfinance,Grad student trying to manage my growing debt.,"Hi all, I’m finally in a place in my life where I feel I can actually handle looking at and planning my financials rather than sticking my head in the sand and hoping everything turns out okay. I am a 25 year old grad student and I work part time. My house is on (debt) fire and I need to get serious about budgeting. I am looking for advice for now as well as long term, so this got huge as I tried to give as many specifics as possible. I need to cut my spending so I can take out as few loans as possible this year. 

I have $60 in my account and blew through my $500 emergency fund with an unexpected school bill early this summer and have not rebuilt it.

Income:

$1,800 /month income from work (I can get a little more work during breaks, but cannot work more during the semester, I tried more and felt on the brink of a breakdown from being overworked.)

$6,738/ year in grants and scholarships 

$28,338/year total

$2,361/month

I am offered up to $16,000/ year in federal unsubsidized loans each school year which will be at 6.8% I believe. 

Debt:

$402 @ 22% Amazon CC (I pay $50/m)

$1,000 @ 17% Citi CC (I pay $100/m)

$1,600 @ 17% Discover CC (I pay $50/m)

$3,750 @ 6.8% Private student loan (I pay $30/m)

$5,5000 subsidized @ 3.4% Federal student loan 1

$5,500 subsidized @ 4.5% Federal student loan 2

$15,671 unsubsidized @ 5.41% Fed unsubsidized 1 (I pay $30/mo)

$4,000 unsubsidized @ 6.8% Federal unsubsidized 2

Overall debt: $37, 423

I am terrified as I don’t think I can live without taking out at least a few thousand more. I intend to start using the avalanche method for my credit cards immediately, but feel its better for me to just take out fewer loans this year than to pay more on my previous loans, or perhaps only pay interest so they do not grow.

Fixed Expenses:

$8,000 /year tuition for full time school each full school year (Fall, Spring and Summer sessions total.) I have two more years of my program left so I have $16,000 worth of schooling ahead of me.

$2,000 /year school related expenses: parking pass, required fees, and books (whenever possible I buy used on amazon but many books are required as new editions.)

$1,100/month household. This money goes into a joint account with my boyfriend who contributes similarly, so this budget gets $2,200/m. These numbers are the last 3 months of spending averaged. (It was 

$1,000/m each from myself and my boyfriend until we had a budget discussion this week and upped the number.)

     $1,100/m rent + utilities (we live in a high cost area and our rent is      the best deal we could find and tolerate, similar accommodations cost $1,350-1,750)

     $330/m groceries, 

     $120/m internet, cell phones, and Netflix, 

     $45/m household items (TP, shampoo, trash bags etc.), 

     $125/m dates/entertainment/eating out

     $12/m pet (rats). 


Nonfixed Expenses: This is what I am most afraid of and embarrassed about. I have been careless and have made impulse buys. This is based off of the average of my spending as tracked by mint.com for the last 3 months. I make almost all of my purchases with card so it’s a pretty good picture of my spending.

$430/m Shopping (the most nebulous and reducible category this includes clothing, make up, supplements for a health condition I have, pleasure reading books, and other random stuff.)

$330/m Education (this includes student loan payments, books and fees, tuition is primarily taken care of by the grant before it gets billed to me, so it doesn’t show up on mint.) 

$270/m Health related (this includes $80/week for necessary treatments for a health condition I have and also an optional monthly $95 medicinal massage that greatly reduces my pain levels.)

$150/month food ($110/m in grocery and $40/m in eating out.) I was buying groceries on my own card to avoid feeling bad about going over budget on the joint account. I will not do that anymore.

$121/month auto including insurance and gas (a paid off used hybrid)

$75/m gifts (I can almost completely eliminate this, I was being 
generous when I was not able to be)

$50/m entertainment (buying music and going out to movies)

$23/m charges and fees

$3,382/month Overall expenses (yearly costs divided by 12)


I am starting my second year of a three year program to become a therapist. I graduate May of 2016. I am then required to do two years and ~2,500 hours of internship. My income during internships will be similar to what I make now, but after I’m licensed average salary for therapists working for an agency is ~$45,000 + decent benefits. I plan on taking on private practice clients on the side and transitioning into private practice as soon as I can make similar take home pay as the salary job. This would be at about 12-20 steady clients per week if I split an office with another part time therapist. This is generally expected to take 1-3 years to attain. I would also like to become a mother in my early 30’s and partially committed to this field because of the ability to work part time for a highish wage per hour and flexibility to work nights and weekends so that childcare can be split between myself and my boyfriend (husband at that point) to keep child care costs low/nonexistent. We are thinking of relocating after I finish school to a lower cost of living area so that we can buy a house.

But I was wondering, will having a nonexistent/bad credit score hurt me after I graduate?

Will getting a credit card, using it regularly, and making regular payments in full help my credit score? Or am I fine the way I am? Because to me, having a credit card is a burden I don't want unless I need to have one and my parents are wrong about me not needing one.

They're developing an scalable, redundant, and quick API that applications can use to provide blockchain access.  Venture backed with several M in financing.  Growing to fifteen people this year.   Not only bitcoin, but will include side-chains, and various alt-coins.  Have about 1,000 developers signed up to their system.  Duck Duck Go uses them for checking balances for BTC Addresses. Also provide unconfirmed transactions and balances in API to guard against unconfirmed transactions and double-spending.  

Their stack is AWS-&gt;BitcoinD Nodes-&gt;GO Code that indexes data -&gt; Postgress DBs of about a terrabyte of data for the entire block chain.  

And their API peers into those DB clusters.

**Flip Filipowski** 

""Today I am going to talk about what it is we know about currencies that makes Bitcoin better.""  He then spoke nothing about that.   

Flip is a polished and entertaining speaker.  But his presentation was only tangentially related to Bitcoin or crypto-currencies.   The first half was about the federal reserve and banking system in the U.S..  He presented a simplified version of fractional banking, and that if you loan ten 10-dollar washers (he used washers to represent money) and expect ten back plus one with interest, where does the one come from?  Well the bankers then have control over the people they loan money to, and this is how the bankers screw customer from the start.  

The second half included interesting historical anecdotes about banking and finance.  Fractional banking derives from early goldsmiths who would loan out gold they held on the deposit for customers.  And the Wizard of Oz was about banking (Oz = Ounces = precious metals), tally sticks were the original bitcoin.  And incidentally, they are also from where the expression 'the short of end of the stick' derives from. (Side note: I cannot find confirmation on the Internet that the expression 'the short end of the stick' actually does derive from the use of tally sticks.  Looking at several sources say the origin of the expression is unknown.)

He then ran out of time.  I'm guessing there was a wrap-up that would have tied back into why Bitcoin was better but we didn't get to that.

However, given Flip's role in Chicago tech sector the past thirty years, I would have liked to hear more of his own personal thoughts on crypto-currencies than a history lesson.    I also get the feeling however that his presentation is better suited for an hour, and is planned to be presented at investor &amp; similar conferences.  If so, that would make more sense and the presentation's content would be better suited there.

Also, he recommended “The Creature of Jekyll Island“ &amp; “The Web of Debt“.  He recommended ""The Victorian Internet"" and ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" many years ago and both were good, so I'll probably give these two a looksie as he does recommend good books.  

Edit: I GET IT NOW!  His VC fund ""TallyCapital"" is probably named based on the tally sticks he spoke of, and said were the ""original bitcoin.""  


**Bitcoin 2.0 Panel**

Bitcoin 2.0 - Smart contracts, smart properties, distributed services like storage, building new protocols on top of the bitcoin blockchain, and products still on the white boards or in alpha stages.  ""Programmable money""

Why is 2.0 so difficult? Because there's hefty regulations by governments for securities and derivatives, plus money transmission rules.  This makes it a very thorny issue legally, and will start to provide a bunch of lawyers a bunch of work for years to come.  

""If it's illegal without bitcoin, it will be illegal with bitcoin too.""  I loved this line, because it's so dead on and yet some people seemed kind of oblivious to it.  

""If you want to head off regulations, then you need to be a good actor."" &amp; ""We are financial services firms, and need to behave like that."" More dead-on quotes that can't be said enough right now.

A lot of time spent talking about new coins and how to avoid pump and dump's.  Know who the development team is.  What are their end goals?  And if you're releasing a new issue, be careful about with SEC and other securities laws that may become effective.  

Anyhow, this talk went about an hour and a half.  It was recorded, so expect to see it online sometime.

Side note: because there was no other corresponding talk in the other room, I took an estimate tally of heads in that talk.  There were about 200 +/- 25.  Plus maybe another 50-75 in the exhibitor area or lounging around.  So the Sunday afternoon probably had about 300 attendees.  You can make of that what you want.  

**Chicago Ventures** 

Summed-up: Chicago is a great place for start-ups and has potential be a hot bed of the bitcoin sector.  Let's hope IL doesn't take NY's lead and fuck this up. (The last sentence is my own editorial).

Bitcoin,Bitcoiners are going to be the new middle class,"Hey buddies.

When it comes to the world. The middle class is currently being destroyed. Slowly.

Some people realise this and look for ways in which to protect their wealth. yea. 

Bitcoin is one possibilty, and if it takes off bitcoiners are going to become the new middle class. In a way bitcoin has already taken off. An exchange rate of $600 has made alot of people a few extra money to spend on various luxeries.

This is why retailers, airliners etc. are some of the first to get in board. They notice how competitive the market for middle class money! has become. Betting on the middle class is basically risky, and there are some reports that suggest middle class luxury and consumption are falling, or specifically companies which specificaly tailor to the middle class are doing worse and worse lately. Bitcoin is a very very thin line we could walk for a brighter future. It is what is going to free us from the money changers and manipulators who are destroying the economy at an alarming rate. Of course the money changers are only a small group in society, but by using the government they have successfully become some of the most powerful. You cant do anything about it. They have the guns, the media, etc. All you can do is use internet+bitcoin speak out against the government as a whole. Notice how it is used over and over again to fulfil personal agendas. Government has become the tool for companies to fool and profit from even the middle class. If you are not taking orders from government, or servicing it one way or the other you are basically putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage. There lacks oversight in government because there lacks incentives to have it. The government bosses are not personally responsible, they just want easy money. And as long as their employees dont cause any problems for the bosses they can do whatever the fuck they want. Doesent matter how much you work, just that the work gets done at the end of the day. Bonus points if you make your boss feel important, etc. This is basically true for most companies, anyway. When working for government its basically a free for all, and the lower you are willing to take your standards the more you can profit. The more you are willing to lie, cheat etc. the more you can profit because no-one really cares. Bosses like a said just get a bag of money every month to run their buisness for, and sometimes if the money runs out, they just get more. Its absolitely insane.

Basically there is a symbiotic relationship between money changing and the lazy bosses in the government. The bosses get to be lazy, and the money changers get to profit. Meanwhile the bill is shafted to the middle class. At the same time you have politicans sitting in their basements figuring out new ways to get votes and be popular, and one of the big things right now is public healthcare. Oh god. A bigger beurocracy, more government bosses, and more potential debt for the money changers to profit from.

But wait a minute. Who are these money changers? Who the fuck is? Is it the federal reserve? Fucked if i know. Best case scenario the money changers are long dead, and whats left is a zombie of sorts that rely on the system they created. This is the big banks, the government etc. Credit has become cheap and that is what these institutions rely upon. But how do you  make credit cheap? Or, seem cheap. This is the trick.

You basically create 'money' that is easy to countefeit. So that, whenever someone wants to borrow money from you, you dont have to have it in your vault, you just type it into a computer, or printing press, and create the money out of thin air. Voila. Then you have cheap credit. But what happens is the money supply increases which drives up prizes. Thats called inflation. 

Basically the more money there is in circulation the more demand there is for goods so to speak. When someone suddenly gets 100k out of thin air, to develop his buisness or build his house or whatever, the money trickles down through the economy. It makes everyone seem richer on the surface, but as the money settles, the end result will only be that prices have gone up, to correspond with the new demand. This basically mean that whoever gets to spend the newly created money first, has the biggest advantage, because the economy and prices are still based on the previous amount of money.

However since the economy is so big, it takes alot of newly created money to make any impact on prices. This is why they can have what.. QE5? Trillions of dollars printed and injected into the economy and only pushing prices up slightly. This cant go on forever tho, and that is the problem because the only way for a QE to be an effective solution is if it can go on forever. Its basically a way to kick the problem down the road. Oh we are running out of money? Rather than optimizing, streamlining etc. perhaps approach a problem entirely differently. They just throw more money at the same approaches and people sitting with the problem. I mean the problem does not get solved... It just gets postponed.

That leads me to bankruptcies which are very much a healthy thing. Its like the markets thing of saying you are doing it wrong. The problem with bankruptcies is they are usually ugly, usually people get involved who can be considered more or less innocent. But again, what is better. The bankruptcy makes the problematic company, the cancer on the economy go away swiftly, and then the recovery starts. healthy buisneses buy up whatever is left of value in the bankrupt buisnes, including any skilled labour etc.

But if poiticians had their way, they would just borrow money (have it created out of thin air) and throw it a trembling buisness, rather than letting the bankruptcy purge the incompetence or problems.",cryptocurrency,1405951475

Right now, I have 5 ""Federal Withholding Allowances"" specified on my employer's HR/Pay site and am seeing roughly $800.00 deducted in taxes each month.

Does this number seem high? Should I, perhaps, alter the number to 12 (the max the site's form allows for) or to 0 to meet our monthly financial needs?

Update: I get 26 paychecks/year.

Thank you for input!",finance,1405956972
personalfinance,Is a personal loan a good option for me?,"Ok, here's the deal. I'm down to about $9800 in debt split up between 4 credit cards. My APR's vary from 11-20%. I'm currently paying about $350 a month for all 4 (I'm making more than the minimum payments). Also may be relevant I have about $25k in student loans. However, those are through the government and my mother pays them.

So, in about a year I'm hoping to buy a new car. I can possibly swing at $200 monthly payment (The cars I was interested in were around $15), but it'd be difficult and I wouldn't have any month left over to save.

Basically what I'm wondering is if a personal loan would be a good idea for my to consolidate my debt? I was thinking to pay as much as I could on my credit cards before buying a car. I'd obviously go through my bank to get a good deal. I have no doubt I could get a better interest rate than I have now with my credit cards. If possible, I could get a loan big enough to cover cards and car ($20k-ish?) and just have 1 monthly payment to worry about. Is this a smart choice?

I hope I've given you guys enough info to help me make a good decision. I know I'm a ways away from deciding all of this, but I'm definitely trying to plan and make the best choice.

personalfinance,"Mortgages, tax deductibles, math, and me","Hi everyone, I've been lurking this subreddit a lot, and this is my first post so please bear with me.


I'm planning on buying a two-family home in NJ while working in NYC. The home I have my eye on is $350k. I can afford a 20% down payment with a $280k 15-yr 3.5% interest rate mortgage.


In short, I'll be paying $3k/month towards the mortgage/property taxes. $1k will be taxes, roughly $800 will be interest (this is amortized, so it will decrease over time), and $1200 will be principle.


From what I understand, I can deduct (ie pay with pretax money, correct?) my property taxes and interest, so roughly $1800 will be paid with pretax money. Currently, I pay about 33% of my salary in taxes. It's a combination of Federal Income, New York State Income, Medicare, and Social Security. When I get this $1800 deducted, is it deducted from all these taxes, or only from the federal income tax? I think I read that it's deducted from everything, but please correct me on that if it isn't. If my math/assumptions is correct, I should be only paying effectively $1200 for this $1800 chunk. Will I continue to be taxed at my current salary and rate and receive the deducted difference as a tax return, or is this something I can take advantage of immediately?


Finally, I'm planning on renting out one of the floors for roughly $1200. If everything is as I think, I'd be paying $1200 for my $1800 worth of interest and property taxes, leaving $1200 to be filled with the rent I receive? Is rent taxable income? This all sounds too good to be true. (Home maintenance and improvements are a whole 'nother story.) Am I possibly missing any other benefits I could be reaping from home ownership?

personalfinance,Need Quick Student loan advice (x-post from /r/studentloans),"I have had a student loan in default several years (costing me a ton of charges in the process)  
My loan was just bought by FAMS (https://www.famspayonline.net/) after me not knowing who had it for a while.  THe last debt collector I had contact with pretty much refused to work with me,  I wanted to get into student loan rehabilitation, but they refused to send me any paperwork or contract, or to get anything in writing, including the amount of my monthly payments so I just noped the F out. 
I get in touch with this lender 3 days after receiving a letter from them, jump around from department to department until I finally get in touch with the right program.

This guy tells me, ok this is what we will do and it will get you out of default within a few months (Knowing rehab takes 10 months I am thinking he just misspoke).  He tells me hes going to email me a ton of paperwork, to fill it out and priority mail it to him, then says we will have a new loan offer and you'll be out of default as soon as we get you to sign the paperwork.  This threw up red flags for me, I said no, I want the rehabilitation.  He says this is basically the same thing, but quicker, and assures me it will still be a federal loan.

What I am thinking is they are going to offer me a new loan, with inflated interest and fees.  Is this correct?  Is my understanding that the only way to get all my negative marks off of my credit report is to rehabilitate my loan, correct?  If it wasn't for my bad credit, I would just pay the loan off right now, but I want to get all negative items off of my credit report and to become eligible for Financial Aid again.  I am paying out of pocket for a community college at the moment but graduate in the spring.  I will not be able to handle the tuition at a 4 year to finish my degree without aid or loans.  (Loans will be a last resort, I learned my lesson when I took this one out at 19)  

The loan balance is only 4630 right now, it was originally 3500 and a 900 was taken out of my last tax refund towards the loan.  

If its of any help, my adjusted gross income was only 15007 last year so If i do the income based repayment I would only have to pay what amounts to pennies while I was in rehabilitation, while saving money to aggressively pay down the loan as soon as the loan was out of default. 

TL;DR
Think i'm getting pressured into something I don't need, should I tell the debt collector that Student Loan Rehab is the only thing that I will do, and use the IBR options.",finance,1405967146

personalfinance,Your Thrift Savings Plan and You: Basic Information,"The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is the U.S. federal government's 401k plan.  It is currently the largest 401k-like plan by invested balance and by participant count.  This short post will outline some of the positives and negatives of the TSP, as well as some strategies on incorporating the TSP into your portfolio.  For general information on 401k plans, see the FAQ entry on [401k plans](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k).

### What is it?

The TSP forms part of US federal employees' retirement triad - the TSP, the Federal Employees Retirement System (pension), and Social Security.  It is a defined contribution plan available to both civilian and military employees of the federal government.  The TSP offers both Roth (post-tax) and Traditional (tax-deferred) accounts.

### What's great about it?

* **Low expense ratios.**  The TSP has some of the lowest expense ratios for its mutual funds (managed by BlackRock) in the business.  The five target date funds (The ""L"" funds) and the six core funds all carry an expense ratio of (currently) 0.029%, or $2.90 for every $10,000 invested.

* **No fees.**  Past the expense ratio, there aren't any fees associated for simply participating in the TSP.

* **Good fund selection.**  The TSP's five core funds cover the major asset classes decently well.  The five core funds and their respective indexes are:

** C fund - US large cap stocks - S&amp;P 500

** S fund - US small cap stocks - DJ US Completion Total Stock Market Index

** I fund - International stocks - MSCI Europe, Australasia, Far East Index (EAFE)

** F fund - US bonds - Barclays Capital US Aggregate Bond Index

** G fund - special fixed income - no private equivalent

* **The G fund.**  The G fund is the closest you can get to a free lunch.  It's a fund composed of specially-issued US treasury securities designed to guarantee against the loss of principal.

* **Lifecycle funds.**  The TSP's Lifecycle target date funds offer a mix of the five core funds in varying percentages that glidepath as the target date approaches.  

* **Good for life (almost).**  Even after separating from federal service you can keep your account open and roll qualifying retirement plans into the TSP.  

* **Civilian agency match.**  Most civilians in the FERS retirement system receive an agency match.

### What's not so great about it?

* **Limited withdrawals.**  The TSP allows you only one partial withdrawal of funds before forcing you to withdraw the entire balance.  This means that once you hit retirement you're likely going to be making some major rollovers into IRAs.

* **No in-plan conversions.**  TSP participants cannot convert any part of their traditional balances to a Roth balance.

* **The I fund is good, not great.**  Of the five core funds, the I fund is the weakest.  It omits Canada, international small cap stocks, and international emerging market stocks.  Privately-run international stock funds such as Vanguard's Total International Stock Market Index offer broader diversification, but at a higher cost.

* **1% Automatic matching has a 3-year vesting period.**  Agency matching up to 5% has no vesting period.  Of course, your own contributions are always vested immediately.

* **Matching is per-paycheck.**  Hitting the $18,000 contribution limit before your final paycheck means you miss out on a portion of your agency's match.

* **Department of Defense does not match contributions for service members.**  Currently only civilians under the FERS retirement system are eligible for agency matches.  

* **No after tax contributions.**  TSP participants are limited to $18,000 in contributions every year.

### How should I use it?

If the TSP is your only retirement fund then the Lifestyle funds offer what every other worthy target date fund offers - automatic allocation and rebalancing for no extra cost.  At 0.029% ER, the L Income and L2020-2050 funds are the cheapest target date funds I'm aware of.

If you have other accounts, the TSP can help reduce your [blended expense ratio](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio) by substituting what you can find in an IRA or taxable account for one of the TSP's options.  The S, F, and G funds in particular can be several basis points cheaper than large, publically available equivalents.  

Finally, the G fund is hands-down the best fixed income fund around.  It eliminates market and credit risk, and is guaranteed not to lose principal.  It is still subject to inflation risk, but has no peers for what amounts to a fund with zero risk.  President Obama's myRA initiative is slated to expand access to the G fund's securities when myRAs are implemented.  The Treasury is still formulating the rules on myRAs.

### Conclusion

The TSP should certainly be considered one of the best benefits of being a federal employee.  It offers inexpensive access to a broad range of securities, with a decent match (for civilians) and access to the unique G fund.  It's not without its problems, though, but hopefully with time the TSP board will bring the features of the plan more in line with what private industry offers in terms of flexible withdrawals/rollovers and in-plan conversions.

personalfinance,Looking for some general advice on my financial/debt outlook (mortgage + student loans).,"Originally meant this to be about mortgage only, but I also want to know how to deal with student loans.

I closed on my house in November 2008. The purchase price was 43k. I put 5k down and took 38k on a 7% loan. I was 20 at the time with no credit, hence the relatively high interest rate. 

Currently I owe around 33k on the house. Payments are $412 which includes prop taxes via escrow. I add $50 principle per month. 

I noticed I'm still paying PMI and I'm wondering about refinancing.

- What steps do I need to take to remove the PMI payment from my bill, if I can?

- Is a mortgage as low as this worth refinancing?

More info: 

- My wife and I don't use credit cards and our only other debt is in student loans (about 40k between us at the moment, almost entirely subsidized).
- She will graduate with a BSN in Spring 2015 and anticipates ~50k starting salary as a nurse.
- I will take at least a semester longer to graduate with double major in English/Econ and don't know my prospects. My current job is decent enough with lots of room for more pay.
- I estimate current income at $2800-3400 per month. Varies due to commissions + school year starting/ending.
- Own two cars outright.
- I don't run a budget, but instead rely on my tendency to avoid reckless spending. This has worked out alright and my wife and I currently earn a mild surplus. Still, it could be better.
- We currently have about $4k in the bank, but I'm going to pay my wife's remaining tuition as I don't want unsubsidized loans or anymore unnecessary student debt. She is maxed out on her subsidized allowance and I am close.
- Need health insurance, looking into options now.

Should I just wait for my wife to graduate and then tear into our debt? I think our total debt after we're both graduated will be approximately equal to a year's worth of combined gross income (conservatively speaking), which sounds OK.

If I'm not refinancing, do I go after the mortgage or student loans first? I'm assuming the mortgage as it will be 7% versus %3.4. I think we'll be looking at ~45k in student loan debt total after both graduating. My next two semesters are essentially free due to winning a large scholarship.

I don't plan on being in this house more than five years. My wife and I are the same age. She will have her BSN at 26 and I'll probably have my degrees at 27. I want the mortgage and student loans to be paid by ~30. At that point we are getting out of this shithole state (MI). I just want to make sure my financial house is in order first.

Lastly, does it sound like I'm making any major mistakes? My wife and I have watched our parents blunder and be slaves to debt and wasteful spending all our lives, and I want nothing to do with it.

news,Business Finance - Improve Your Business Now,"To obtain proper business financing is not an easy task at the best of times for most small and medium sized business owners and directors. Visit us or join us online and we will melt faster than several other banks or other lenders do. When your corporation requests money, we are here to contribute. This financing information and education sources come in two varieties: 

	Textbook
	Major bank advertising

On that point are legions of reasons that collectively explain why the business financing market can be so difficult to read and navigate. Our formal training system offers limited data as to how the market works, how to plan for financing requirements, how to manage periods of increase, decline, transition, startup, etc. Business finance is generally taken on lease and in return interest rate is paid off.
The serious tidings are that financing sources continue to rise in numbers as more and more lenders carve out a special part of the market to help. Small and medium sized business financing is focused on both interpersonal and business credit history. Looking for business financing is a selling practice. When applying for this financing, then you are marketing your business to lending sources and they in turn are marketing their production financing programs to you.

There are tons of businesses financing sources. But there are also tons of variations in the types of job applications each one is devised to take. Before you establish a conventional application, obtain out if the lender delivers the programs and lending track record to match your specific demands. Depending on the scenario, there can be several financing schemes that could run for your job. It's almost impracticable to finance small businesses without a loan from the bank, although most banks will not deliver loans until you have completely proven that your miniature production is flourishing and profitable through factoring.
Despite owning the exact home you want is an outstanding benefit, financing home construction can be a different thing. If you're playing with a custom constructor, you will require to assume something known as a ""construction loan"". This is the loan that pays off the builder while they establish your dwelling. Construction financing is typically short term loans that carry a higher interest rate than your traditional mortgage. Advances like commercial loan, mortgage, investment, business finance, residential loans, construction loans, etc. are being pointed to actual borrowers by brokers at reasonable price.
Likewise, you should also analyze the facial expressions in terms of special services. If you are attending for a particular broker for construction finance, you should tick the selected service provider in terms of technological aspects of construction works. Most importantly, professional skill of a broker must not be missed at any price. It is their professionalism that takes in everything within gave deadline. For better service, a broker always tends to supply you with utmost convenience at all steps. Foremost of all, they would visit you to collect your credentials required for construction loans. Also, they examine them right and make sure that every required document has been attached accordingly.

It is turning into a full-time work simply to peruse and attempt to evaluate how to utilize every informal communication site. I compare every one to a planet in an inconceivable world. Furthermore with every planet comes special tenets, manners, dialect and social desires. As such, being successful on one of the outside planets obliges a lot of figuring out how to best work in nature. 

Focus Your Gathering of people 

So where do you start and how would you pick which locales to regular? It is safe to say that you are a development business, a law office, a performer, a developing music craftsman or the following VIP culinary expert? There are an entire host of sites now for every single specialty, sort and industry. You can go considerably more remote than that; today you can interface on discussions, shopping locales, online journals, online daily papers also particular to the gathering of people you are focusing on. 

Set aside a few minutes 

Social networking showcasing and informal communication obliges both control and expertise on Unomatch - some are wired for this and others essentially are most certainly not. Regardless, it is getting to be progressively imperative to search out these new and continually changing streets in light of the fact that this is the place buyers are investing their time. No more sufficient is the quarterly email or radio spot or conveying a flyer via the post office. Today, shoppers are online; they are online at home, they are online at work and in the auto, at the shopping center, in the washroom and at a companion's home. Not just must you set aside a few minutes to visit your consistent stepping grounds, yet you have became persistently perusing up on every new site that rises up out of regular and week to week. 

Enlist an Online networking Partner 

Numerous entrepreneurs basically don't have sufficient energy to scour the Web, regardless of the possibility that they have heard that another device is accessible. Some may let you know that keeping up your Twitter and Unomatch statuses may just take to the extent that 15 minutes a day. The reality of the situation is, concerning speaking to your organization and collaborating with people in general, and doing it well, could exceptionally well take a few hours a day. 

The choice turns into a matter of how critical you think social networking is to your business. Enlisting an infrequent apparition scholar or believe it or not, a social networking colleague, can provide for you that edge in today's business sector. Virtual partners, contract laborers that you enlist without the requirement for office space or the cost of worker profits, get true possessions in a general public dependent on velocity and data. They can give the consistent stream of value substance for your site, web journals, long range interpersonal communication profiles, driving movement with the objective of expanded deals while in the meantime, giving the fix the general population needs. 

Accept it or not, contracting the best ones will be exceptionally talented in exploration, written work, advertising, and have the web wise and tolerance to overcome the unfathomable territory we call the Web. Times are changing, as they generally do, however perhaps more rapidly than at any other time. Will you truly manage the cost of not to consider online networking advertising important? 

Betty Arnold is a previous official right hand, and now entrepreneur. Her experience in humanism, open talking and advertising, joined with her yearning to help others dispatch new organizations puts her at the cutting edge of online networking promoting today.

I will be attending a top school so I feel the return on investment will work extremely well in my favor. The three year program will cost close to $75,000. My employer will reimburse me each calendar year @ the IRS limit of $5,250. For purposes of my scenario let’s call the total cost of attendance $60,000 or $20,000/yr.

Married. No kids. Dual income of ~$200,000. The school happens to be nearby so there aren’t any additional living expenses that need consideration. In theory, we should be able to put away ~$50,000 a year in after-tax savings. We both contribute 10% of our salaries into our employer 401ks.

Balance Sheet

Long-Term Debt

$405,000 30 year 3.5% mortgage

$8,000 auto note @ 3% (Plan on paying it off this month)

Short-Term Debt

None

Assets

$500,000 of non-qualified assets (Very fortunate. Most of this money is in a trust that my wife’s grandfather left her. This money cannot be touched for another 5 years)

$50,000 of qualified assets (401ks and IRAs)

$50,000 in the bank

personalfinance,First job out of college have a long commute. Lets talk car options.,"Hi all, I'm a recent college grad and just landed a job that pays 50k a year. The distance to work from my house is a decent commute but not prohibitively long. It is 40 miles one way, so lets say 85 miles a day is what I will be putting on the odometer. The drive is a straight shot and is pleasant enough. 

Moving closer is not an option due to being in an ideal rental situation with my landlords being my fiances parents (they own two homes and bought the second one for us). My rental obligation's per month, in a nice house, is merely $300 a month; going rate would be usually $800 so I'm very lucky. 

My current vehicle is a 14 year old car that I have had since I was 16 years old. It still runs fine but I can see some issues arising in the next year. Besides the maintenance, it is a gas hog that makes 19 mpg and is not enjoyable to commute in (been driving manual for 10+ years but I'm ready to switch to automatic since I live in the city and stop and go traffic is a chore). Keeping this car is not an option for me, it needs to go.

Now that the background is layed out, my question and dilemma is the very common question that arises often here and that is - should I get a new car financed or buy used? I've never owned a new car and my parents don't buy new but my fiance is giving me a convincing push to go to the dealership and get a new car. 

If I were to finance new I have my eyes set on a Toyota Prius purely for the gas mileage. I believe there is free maintenance for 100,000 miles as well. Does driving 20,000+ miles a year justify the expense of a base model 2014 Toyota Prius? 

On the flip side the used car market seems to be pretty lackluster but from looking about I would likely shell out around $11,000 for a car with low 30's highway mpg and around 70,000 miles on the odometer. In 5 years time I would take a 70,000 starting mileage car well over 170,000 miles on the odometer

Selling to a private party I should be able to sell my car for $6,000 at the lowest.

Forgot to add, I do have $16,000 in student loans at 3.8% interest rate. I'm still in my repayment grace period for another few months and the minimum payment I'm obligated to pay is $130.",finance,1406032734
personalfinance,"[USA] Complicated question about buying a home solo with an FHA loan, then bringing someone in later","So I'm very new to the home buyers search, but since I just started a salaried 	position, this has been on my mind. 

I am making about 32,000 /year, and live with parents. My main expense at the moment is car payments. Since I don't have much money saved up, my best bet for buying a house is with an FHA loan. ( http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/buying/loans ) I've been told that it would be really smart to do this in 2014, since interest rates are due to rise as the economy recovers. 

I am in a relationship, and plan on marrying her, but I know she wanted to stay with her parents a little longer to save up some money -- at least one more year. The other thing to note is that she makes more money than I do, and she has better credit. So when she is ready to buy a home, she might not even need the FHA loan. 

So here's my question. If i buy the home with the FHA loan this year, and she moves in in 2015 or 2016, what would happen if I wanted to let her ""buy"" partial ownership of the house (and or the loan and insurance?). What does that process look like? Would we be able to refinance the home together in order to bring down the interest rate? Would that bring down home-owner's insurance?

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 195 - Guest Post: Why We Do What We Do,"Hey all! GoodShibe... on Vacation! (sort of...)

Please enjoy this post by Guest Writer /u/Bioman312 and tip them well ;D)

Hello everyone!

My name is /u/Bioman312, and this is a guest post for /u/GoodShibe while he takes his vacation. I've been an avid follower of Dogecoin since December of last year, and I've taken the initiative to help out wherever I can on the subreddit through various informational posts, which can be found in a big list at the end of this edition of ""Of Wolves and Weasels.""

Now, I wouldn't call myself an economist by any means, but I do have at least a basic understanding of macro- and micro-economics through various courses in my education background, and one of the most important lessons that is taught in any economics or business course is to always look for a motive in everybody.

This is usually taught as a word of caution to protect from those who would wish to scam you, take advantage of you, or otherwise get some profit at the cost of your well-being. 

For example, a real estate advisor may advise you to take a less-than-optimal offer on a house because a hasty decision would cause the advisor to get his commission quicker. This doesn't mean the advisor is ""bad"" in any sense; it just means that he is doing what all rational decision-makers do: trying to maximize benefit and minimize cost.

This is basically what you would be taught in an introductory class in economics. However, I want to take it in a different direction.

The Dogecoin community is known for being one of the most generous of any crypto, and it can be readily seen from all the initiatives that the community has taken (Doge4Water, the NASCAR sponsorship, Doge4Education, etc.), as well as its avid tipping.

Although this doesn't mean that scammers don't exist in the Dogecoin community, it DOES mean that we can look at motives of other users in a more positive light.

Take a moment to think about why you participate in Dogecoin. Is it to make a speculative profit? Because that's not a bad thing, and speculators are the reason why cryptos can survive in the first place. 

Or maybe you're in it to help in charitable giving initiatives, or possibly just to see the coin succeed. All of these are valid motives for buying, mining, or giving Dogecoin.

However, just because of human nature, it's very difficult to see the motives of other people in a positive light when they contradict one's own. Think about how many shibes are concerned about the low price of Dogecoin at the moment. You can tell that there are quite a few, as there are a few posts about the price making it through /new/ to the front page.

However, the majority of those don't.

Whenever people post saying that they are concerned about their investments in Dogecoin, there's usually this kneejerk reaction by the community to shut the person down. This is mainly due to people's natural opposition to people who don't share their own motives. If someone is ONLY into Dogecoin to see charitable initiatives succeed, then a post about trying to increase the price seems contradictory and hostile to that person. The converse is also true: If someone ONLY wants to see a return on investment into Dogecoin, then that person would very quickly get fed up with all the posts talking about Josh Wise, as that's not something that directly helps with the price.

Today I want to use my guest post to encourage the readers of OWAW to truly look at the motives of other shibes, not to try to fish out scams, but to understand where they come from and why they say what they do. Let's try to allow people who are concerned with wildly varying aspects of the coin (development, mining, investing, giving, etc.) to speak their minds without falling to that kneejerk reaction and immediately downvoting because the poster's motive isn't the same as our own. If we start doing this, then we're going to see so much progress in the community, as more and more issues will be fixed, and more and more initiatives will be started.

I want to thank you all for reading this edition of ""Of Wolves and Weasels,"" and I'm very anxious to see your response to my guest post. If you have anything to say, please post it in the comments below, and hopefully we can get a cool discussion going.

Thank you once again for reading!

personalfinance,Think twice before you co-sign a loan!,"Hello! I'm a credit analyst for a commercial bank. I analyze home loans of all sizes and commercial loan requests from $100,000 to $25+ million. I wanted to talk about co-signing on loans.

All the time I see a sad situation that roughly goes like this: A boyfriend and girlfriend will be in love and one of them can't afford the car they'd like. So they have their SO co-sign on a car-note, credit card, and sometimes even a mortgage (yikes!). 

Sometime down the line they realize things aren't going to work out the way they thought they would and they break up. But what about that loan? Now the situation is the man or woman might not be able to afford those payments on their own. 

And as much as we'd like to think people will still be nice and send payments for the car that's often not the case! The boyfriend or girlfriend will just be so fed up with their ex-SO that they say 'Screw that! I'm not sending them another dime!'. 

This is terrible because not only are they hurting their ex-SO (who will likely have the car repo-ed) they are hurting themselves. Because they co-signed the note they are BOTH still liable whether they're together in a relationship or not. Now it hurts not just their ex's credit score, but their own credit score as well! 

The longer it goes unpaid the worse it gets and it will eventually show up as a repo on both of the credit reports! This is a messy situation.

My advice is to treat co-signing on a loan as you would a marriage contract! It's a very serious obligation! If you're co-signing a note you should think 'Is there absolutely no doubt in my mind I'll still be with this person by the time this note is paid in full?' If there is, DO NOT SIGN THE NOTE!

Have a good day everyone! If you have any questions about personal finance, credit, mortgages, what you could afford, etc just let me know!",finance,1406037451

personalfinance,Am I withholding too much from my bi-weekly paycheck? And what's the harm if I am?,"(As a heads up, I'm using a throwaway to post this, as a lot of my friends, family, and co-workers are aware of my regular account.  I don't necessarily want them to know the nitty-gritty of my finances.)

I started a new job earlier this year, and after looking at some of my recent paychecks I'm concerned that I have too much being withheld from my paycheck for state and federal taxes.

I make about 1,250 per paycheck.  Out of that, around $120 is taken out for federal and about $70 is taken out for state.

When I talked with the accountant at my new job when I was hired, I asked for a bit more to be withheld because I had just recently paid my state / federal taxes for the previous year.  I had been spooked by the fact that I had to pay in a bit more than expected, so I didn't want to have to deal with that surprise again in early 2015.

But that said, am I still withholding too much?  I feel like my take home pay should probably be a bit more.  And also, is there any real harm in it anyways?  In theory, shouldn't I just see it next year in the form of a tax rebate anyways?  I'm not exactly hurting for it now, and would probably just put it in savings / investments when the rebate comes back.

I haven't worked the past 2.5 years and we've been living off my spouse's income (approx 88k). I'm starting a new job this month and our new combined gross annual income will be 238k. We would like to save for a house and for our retirement. We are 27 and 28 years old. 

**The specifics**: 
*90k total in student loans*
**undergrad loans (25k)**: 4 loans have interest rates between 5.75-6.5%; the other 4 are interest rates of 2.05% to 2.4%  **grad loans (65k)**: all loans are between 6.5 to 6.8%  **annual gross income between spouse and I:** 238k
**savings:** 30k; 401k for spouse 30k; 401k for me 20k (hasn't had any money put in since I started school)
**new job 401k:** I selected 4% to a 401k and 2% to a roth IRA; we own both of our cars, so we don't have car payments; we put all our expenses on a credit card (approx 2.5k/month) which we pay off every month

we pay $855 in rent (on the cheaper side bc we have a roommate)

I have a new mint.com account and did some of the ""goals"" on there and it said I should be saving almost 2k a month for retirement, and 4k for a house, which seems like a lot????

So I'm basically just looking for some advice on how to save for a house and retirement, all while paying my loans. Because of this new income, we don't want to piss it all away and we don't know how to deal with having two incomes. 

**TL;DR:** 90k in loans, new job combined with spouses income=238k. want to know how much to save for retirement and a house, don't want to piss all the money away.

personalfinance,Made a mistake by acquiring my girlfriend's $10k worth of credit card debt... help,"*Throwaway account, because my girlfriend knows my reddit account, and this affects our relationship.*

So I moved in with my girlfriend recently. We agreed that it was important to share expenses (groceries, gas), so we opened a credit card together with USAA to cover those expenses, and we each got a card. I opened it under my account initially, because my credit was better, and it gave us a low interest rate and high limit. 

The problem comes where my girlfriend transferred over all of her credit card debt into it, totaling about $10K, taking up most of the available credit ($12k limit). We agreed that she should do it (*so she didn't do it secretly*), but I'm regretting that greatly. I'm in a bind, because I'm thinking of ending the relationship (it just hasn't been working out since we moved in together). I'm wondering **how to get this debt out of my name**. Right now, both of our names are on the account.

PF, this card was opened in my name initially, but she was added first as an authorized user, then as an account holder. USAA told me that neither account holder can be removed from a joint card, but rather the account has to be closed outright. The problem is this: My girlfriend had about a dozen different misc. credit cards with balances, and can't transfer this one lump balance onto another card... **her credit score isn't high enough to get a card with this high of a limit because she had a discharged bankruptcy four years ago.** So I'm not sure what options I have to get the debt out of my name should I decide to break things off with her. I'm trying to covertly figure things out, because she doesn't know I'm thinking of breaking it off.

Yea, I messed up by opening a joint account with somebody who isn't financially stable (again, that's an issue for /r/relationships). Her debt has lowered my credit score by a solid 20 points, and I imagine it's going to go lower. But what options do you guys think I have to jettison her debt from my name? Not sure if she can take out a loan (probably not), and she'd have to transfer balances to her misc credit cards (a lot of which she's already closed). I know there's probably not a silver bullet, but I'm just kind of lost as to what I should be doing to get out from underneath it. I'm also scared, because I have always worked to keep my debt under control (no high credit card balances, no student loans, no car loans.... no mortgage either -- yet). Oh, yea, and right now I'm unemployed. That makes me even more scared (yea, personal things to take to /r/relationships).

***So here's my question: how would I go about getting her debt off my card, since if I close it, that balance would have to go somewhere, and she doesn't have a line (or lines) of credit to handle it anymore, or may not be willing to try to move it if we have a bad breakup. I can't remove myself from the card.*** I'd appreciate the help, guys. Thanks.

* **1947**: After the british failed to create a jewish and arab states, the UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) proposes a plan to create the independent states and have an independent City of Jerusalem under International Trustee control. The General assembly accepts this plan, Israel accepts this plan(which gives the majority of the land to the Arabs mind you), but teh Arab League rejects the plan. 
    * **POINT:** Israel even at its founding was willing to give palestinians a majority of the land. 

* **1948** After the above plan fails, the Jewish Agency declares the establishment of the Jewish state. **IMMEDIATELY** Arab armies from Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq attack Israel. This is known as **the 1948 Arab-Israeli War**. This war lasted one year and resulted in a cease fire. In the cease fire, Jordan took the West Bank including East Jerusalem, and Egypt took the Gaza Strip. 
    * **POINT:**    Israel accepted a cease fire that gave all of the west bank and gaza to the arabs. 

* **1949** the UN officially recognizes and admits Israel. 

* **1950s** The Palestinian fedayeen frequently attack israel from the **EGYPTIAN OCCUPIED GAZA STRIP**
    * **POINT:** It was Egypt that wouldn't give the Palestinians citizenship or help them at this time. The other Arabs were the ones abandoning them. 

* **1964:** Arab countries attempt to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River and deprive Israel of water. Under international law this is a **declaration of war**. Now, water rights overall is an entirely large subject itself and I wont' get into it here but it should be noted at this early stage it was not Israel who was the aggressor. 

* **1967: The Six Day War** I won't go into the entire history of the 6day war but TL;DR the Arab Countries were getting ready for a full invasion of Israel, Israel saw this and pre-emptively attacked Egypt's airforce, destroying it, and won the war quickly. At the end Israel DID take and occupy the West Bank, The Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and the entire Sinai Peninsula(large part of egypt). Jerusalem's boundaries were enlarged, now incorporating East Jerusalem. 

* **1977** Egypt recognizes Israel as a country, the first Arab nation to do so, and enters into talks of a peace treaty. 
* **1979** The Camp David Accords and the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty are signed. Israel completely withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West band and the Gaza Strip. 
    * **POINT:** Israel gave back the Sinai Peninsula, which was bigger than Israel itself, in the name of peace and recognition from Egypt. 

* **1981** Israel annexes the Golan Heights, I'm including this because counter points are important, sometimes Israel did want land. However the Golan Heights was never particularly contentious, if you go there now it's wine country full of vineyards and wineries, no fighting. 

* **1982** the PLO repeatedly attacking from the north, had to be dealt with as Lebanon had no control over its own border at that point. Israel invaded southern Lebanon, Syria invaded northern Lebanon. **RESULT**: Israel occupies southern Lebanon, Syria occupies northern Lebanon. 

* **1986** Israel **withdraws** from southern lebanon, maintaining just a buffer zone. Syria, who was supposed to withdraw as well, lies and does not. Syria doesn't withdraw from lebanon until the mid 2000s. 
    * **POINT:** Once again we see Israel giving land back. This stems from Israel's desire not for more land, but for stable borders. 

* **1992** Israel and the PLO Sign the **Oslo Accords**, which gave the Palestinian National Authority rights to govern parts o f the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In this, **the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism**
    * **POINT:** Once again we see Israel willing to give up the land and rule of the land in the name of peace. All Israel wants is stable borders with stable nations on each of them. Note that the PLO Pledged an end of terrorism in exchange and that's all israel wanted. 

* **1992-1995** This was a period where admittedly, Israel screwed up. Settlements and checkpoints with these areas greatly diminished support for everything from the Arabs, causing fighting, which in turn diminished support form the Jews. In November 1995, the PM of Israel was assassinated by a Jew who opposed everything that was happening. 

* **late 1990s** Israel withdraws from a city in the west bank known as Hebron, Israel also signs the Wye River memorandum which gives more control to the Palestinian National Authority. 

* **2000** At an international summit at Camp David, Israel offers a plan for the establishment of a Palestinian state. In this Israel realized with the current jewish settlements in the West Bank, totally turning it over was impossible. Israel offered **100% of the Gaza Strip and 73% of the West Bank** for a Palestinian state that would expand over 10-25 years to be **92%** of the west bank. Israel would **withdraw from many settlements, as many as 63 by some accounts** leaving ONLY the large populations. Israel maintained the right to control a road from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, with free passage for Palestinians, and in turn Israel would allow Palestinians use of a highway to connect the West Bank and Gaza. In the end **Israel would retain just 9% of the West Bank in exchange for a 1% land swap** Totally admitted, this plan was NOT perfect for the Palestinians, there were issues with the divisions of the West Bank and areas with Israeli control. There was also the whole issue of East Jerusalem However the point still stands **Israel wasn't and isn't in it for the land, as is shown by their willingness to give the entire gaza strip and a majority of the west bank back** The Palestinians were the ones to reject this deal. 

* **2005** Israel COMPLETELY withdrew from Gaza. All Israeli settlements in Gaza were dismantled, by force when necessary. If Israel wanted the land, they'd have just stayed there. Now, the blockade is another discussion, but this is mainly to show how this isn't about the land itself.

* **2007** with the Battle of Gaza, Hamas completes their takeover of Gaza and the very recent issues begin which I won't explain here. 


**OVERALL MESSAGE** Throughout history Israel has been willing to give up 100% of the Gaza strip and the majority of the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for peace, secure borders, and the reduction of terrorism. It was the Arabs throughout these periods that repeatedly denied all efforts by Israel to do so. **NOTE I AM NOT SAYING ISRAEL IS WITHOUT BLAME IN ANYTHING, I AM SIMPLY SAYING HISTORY INDICATES ISRAEL IS NOT IN IT FOR THE LAND, THAT IS ALL.**",cryptocurrency,1406048492

The early conclusion came Tues period from a three-judge panel of the U.S. Yard of Appeals for the Regularise of University. The body, in a pupil exhalation to the law, ruled 2-1 that the IRS went too far in extending subsidies to those who buy contract through the federally run commerce, celebrated as Aid.gov.

A place federal appeals act — the Quartern Raceway Hotel of Appeals — hours afterward issued its own judgement on a quasi covering that upheld the subsidies in their totality.

The conflicting rulings would typically fast-track the concern to the Supreme Authorities. Yet, it is prospective that the direction will ask the D.C. appeals act to foremost convene all 11 book to re-hear that circumstance.

Noneffervescent, the D.C. hotel judgement withal strikes at the understructure of the law by hard subsidies that billions of fill obtained through the federally run commutation acknowledged as Care.gov.

The proceedings maintained that the language in ObamaCare actually restricts subsidies to state-run exchanges — of which there are exclusive 14 — and does not allow them to be given in the 36 states that use the federally run system.

The happening, Halbig v. Burwell, is one of the honours stellar lawful challenges that cuts to the nerve of the Inexpensive Fear Act by going after the legality of monolithic fed subsidies and those who good from them.

The choice said the law “unequivocally restricts” the subsidies to insurance bought on state-run exchanges.

The negative view, tho’, claimed semipolitical motivations were at sport. “This individual is active Appellants’ not-so-veiled crime to gut the Diligent Protection and Inexpensive Attention Act (‘ACA’),” the dissent explicit.

The judgment, tho’ potential to be appealed, could threaten the total substructure of the newly devised upbeat fix system. Nearly 90 proportion of the yank exchange’s insurance enrollees were entitled for subsidies because of low or average incomes, and the outcome of the casing could potentially lose zillions without cheap health shelter.

Today’s choice justifiedly holds the Obama administration accountable to the law,” Sen. Orrin Multiply, R-Utah, said in a handwritten statement adding, “… As it has on so umpteen occasions, the Obama tenure just neglected the law and implemented its own contract instead.

The incoming block for the Obama body would be that they petition a so-called en banc ruling, which way there would be a vote confiscated by all of the book on the curtilage. An appeals suite can only overrule a judgment prefabricated by a panel if the move is sitting en banc.

Serious said the Section of Justice give promising name to the filled D.C. Racetrack Court and defended the administration’s part that Legislature planned “all desirable Americans” to person access to the subsidies disregardless of which entity set up the workplace.

“We are overconfident in the legitimate billet that we make,” Earnest said.

Ron Gadoid, foundation executive director of Families USA, said in a typewritten evidence that the ruling “represents the high-water differentiate for Inexpensive Upkeep Act opponents, but the liquid leave recede real rapidly.”

The appeals noesis could yet lead to the U.S. Supreme Move determinative on the legality of the subsidies, but Pollock, whose unit supports the law, believes that won’t bump.

Of the 11 book that could hear the sufferer, cardinal are Democrats and cardinal are Republicans.

I recently checked my credit report for the first time in many years, and it's pretty embarrassing. 

There's ~$12k in student loans from 2008. It seems like the same collections company keeps charging off the debt and then re-opening the debt to keep in on my credit report every year. So I have something like 4 records from this 1 debt, with the most recent one being 2012 I believe. I kept getting phone calls from them, even after I told them to mail me something. Because they would not tell me their mailing address, I refused to tell them mine. The phone calls disappear after a while, and then reappear. I just automatically ignore all calls from unknown numbers now.

I have an old foreclosure from 2009, and it seems like the debt was sold and bought at least 2 times, so there are some bad credit records from this as well. The most recent of this is 2011.

I also owe ~$2k backtaxes from 2009 to California.

I supposedly owe $3k in utilities from ~2009 for electricity for an abandoned property. I got a phone call for this one, and it seems like the collections agency tried to reset the SOL.

I (21M) will be beginning law school in a couple weeks at one of the best public law schools in the Midwest (where I intend to practice after graduation). 

I will receive a 10,000/yr scholarship from the school,
which brings tuition to around 30,000 for the first year, and around 25,000 for the subsequent two years.

Thanks to some fairly lucrative summer opportunities with a military contractor, I have around 45k in savings at the moment. This opportunity does not have a base in the legal system, but I do manage 10-12 people and 10-12 sets of virtually priceless equipment.  I'm a department lead for monthly contracts that generally run between 15-25 million dollars.  I think that can still be attractive to prospective employers. I'm the youngest department lead by roughly 15 years, and and among the most well-paid. 

I have no outstanding loans from my undergraduate career.   I will be renting a room in a house near the law school for 600/mo including utilities. My parents have very graciously agreed to cover that portion of my expenses, and potentially will help with tuition depending on their financial situations.  

So PF, my question is how to best allocate my 45k in savings. 

- total bill for law school will be 30k +25k +25k = ~80k

- Savings: currently 45k

Loans:

- Federal unsubsidized at 6.21 % up to 20k per year.

- Federal grad plus at 7.5% to cover any potential remaining tuition. 


Part of me wants drain my savings up front on my first year and just pay it off in full, since by the numbers, it is the cheapest method. This would leave me with about 15k in savings, so I'd be more dependent on loans for my final two years.

Another opinion was to take the 20,000 dollar loan in full every year, and pay the remaining 5-10k, which would leave me more flexibility for a home or something like that in the future.

Bank accepts the loan at 2% higher interest than he/she had before, but then tells him/her the bank can't loan at a higher interest rate on a refinance. Was this a legal reasoning or was this just the bank costing itself money? Yes, obviously this isn't entirely hypothetical but for obvious reasons I need to keep the anonymity up.

personalfinance,So my scholarship got cancelled...more than doubling my debt. What to do?,"Hi all. I'm about to begin my second year in a master's program. I was set for a full-tuition scholarship with a $1500/mo stipend this year, but was just notified today that my university was not renewed for this particular federal fellowship. I've just finished an hour's worth of panicking - thought I'd ask for advice.


I attended undergrad on a full scholarship. I've got $33,500 in debt from my first year of graduate school and was really psyched about NOT increasing that. Now it looks like I'll have to at least double it. Here's the breakdown:

- After a merit scholarship, I'll owe $34,800 in tuition for this year

- I signed a nine-month lease for $815/mo while I thought I still had the scholarship.

- I've got a job for 12 hr/wk and $15/hr, totaling $720/mo before taxes

- As a graduate student I'm ""not allowed"" to work more than 20 hours per week at the university ($15/hr set rate). I'm going to look for another research assistantship or TA position to make up the remaining 8 hours per week that I'm allowed as soon as I get back to campus, but that's up in the air for now.


So, a few questions:

1. I shouldn't drop out in face of this loan, right? Half a master's degree looks stupid, yes?

2. **What sort of odd jobs can I take on to make up the cost-of-living gap?** I'm a 24 year old 
female. I'll be taking five daytime classes, TAing, and writing my thesis.

3. Most single-person apartments in my area are more than mine and I do feel like I had a good deal, but I'm wondering if I should break the lease, eat the deposit, and find a roommate. Would this look bad?

4. I'm eligible for $60k in federal student loans. $60k  is more money than my parents ever made combined, so it's freaking me out a little. I definitely shouldn't take out all of it, but should I take out some for living expenses on top of tuition? Should I instead take out just enough for tuition and rent so that I *have* to find some way to make up the rest?

5. Am I worrying about nothing? Is this degree of debt normal?


Other things that may be relevant:

1) I think I'll be fairly employable after I graduate. I have an undergraduate engineering degree from a top 20 university and am getting my master's in an admittedly less-lucrative social science field at a top 10 university.

2) I'm planning to live in/near Washington DC after I graduate, which will be fairly expensive.

3) I really, really hate debt. This is likely a common sentiment here, but in addition to working I considered donating my eggs last year to cut down on loans. I really don't want to have to do this because I'm worried about the health effects. Should I reconsider? It's just so much fucking money.

Any/all advice welcome. Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** Thanks so much, everyone. I've calmed down and am thinking like a normal human again. Great advice, all. Going to stay in my program, eat the debt, probably keep the apartment, email my financial aid office, etc etc.",finance,1406067444

I've been reading about which home improvements recoup the most costs. I don't expect to get 100% back, but if I do the projects well, I would like to get close to what I put in. 

I know it would be best to save up and pay for the costs out-of-pocket, but most of my savings are going into a wedding fund at the moment. (You cant be practical about everything!) Some contractors offer 1 year 0% financing, so that's another consideration.

From an income perspective, I could take on the extra loan amount. My yearly mortgage is about 21% of my gross income. I have no other debt.

personalfinance,Need advice about how to deal with Sallie Mae,"A few years ago, I received a letter in the mail from Great Lakes student loans saying that my loan had been transferred to Sallie Mae. Ever since it has been a complete nightmare.

I am still in school, working towards an Associate's Degree. Ever since I began school 2 years ago, Sallie Mae has been incessantly billing me monthly, and tacking on late fees with every one.

I have called countless times to remind them that I am still in school, have not yet graduated, and I do not understand why they continue to bill me. One representative told me that in their records, I graduated UW-Milwaukee in 2006. I explained that was impossible, as I only graduated high school in 2005. On another call, a representative informed me their system reflects that I graduated in 2012, the same year I enrolled in the tech school I'm at now. When I point out how little sense that makes, they talk to me like I'm dumb and I have no idea what I'm talking about. 

For every month of 2013, I was billed, and given a late fee. Went to the bursar's office to have them continue to send proof that I am, in fact, still in school. Sometimes the bills will stop for a few months, but the late fees are never retroactively removed and the billing simply begins again.

This year, not even 2 weeks after spring finals, I was billed, and given a late fee. I called again, and asked why they were billing me, that I haven't graduated yet, that I'd only been on summer break for 2 weeks. She told me that it was the system ""updating"" and I've worked enough in tech support to know that generally that's just a means to appease callers. I pressed further, saying, if the problem is on their end with the updating, why am I being punished with a bill and late fees? She couldn't answer, merely recited the usual ""I'm sorry you're having this problem."" 

She said the most she could do was put my account on a 60 day hold. I asked if this meant taking forbearance or deferment time (I believe each student only gets a certain number of months for both), and she didn't understand what I was asking, so I still have no idea. I'd informed her that in 60 days I still wouldn't be back in school-- that I didn't think I should be getting ANY bills whatsoever. She repeated that was the best she could do for me. I asked for some sort of confirmation number or proof that this hold had been applied, and she told me there was no such thing, but that I am welcome to keep checking their website until the changes are reflected.

 I am under the impression that students get a 6 month grace period post-graduation to begin repaying back their loans. The reps at Sallie Mae told me I was wrong, and that the 6 month thing doesn't exist. Also, I was laid off of work and when I explained my unemployed status to them, asking if I can get the loans put off until I am hired again, she deflected and wouldn't comment about it. I was under the impression that the new federal laws passed prohibited student loan companies from billing students who were unemployed, or at least limited the monthly charge. (Mine is about $100/month).

Just looking for some advice here on what I can say/do with Sallie Mae, or some online resources so I can better learn my rights and the laws. I will be graduating in December and I am already terrified about all the ways SM will be harassing me the moment I get my degree. Right now I'm pretty ignorant about all the laws and so it's probably apparent that it's easy to bully me.

personalfinance,Using financial aid refund to make dents in previous loans?,"I'm not entirely sure if this falls under personal finance, but it is a form of debt and (by extension?) maybe has something to do with finance? Regardless...

This is gonna be my first semester at a four-year.  I'm going in a sophmore so I'll be graduating in 2017.  I didn't do any calculations when accepting student loans and found out just recently that it's gonna cost me about $12k a year to pay for school. I'm attending a private school but my Dad used to work there and has since retired, giving me tuition remission.

My main issue is that I have gotten $5k from the Pell Grant (so $2.5k a semester) and a useful set of loans - but one of the loans I didn't really need.  Thus, I'll have around $4k this semester in refunds and have two previous loans from community college at $1.7k and $2.3k respectively ($1.7 interest rate is 3.4% and 2.3 interest is 6.8%).  Should I use some (or all) of this money to pretty much knock out one of these loans?

I don't intend to continue taking out these excess loans - I just slipped up this year and didn't do my math - so I figured I'd do something useful with the extra money. Is this a good idea or no?",finance,1406084842

personalfinance,Difficult Situation - Advice Requested,"Hello everyone.  I've been reading this sub for a long time, but it is my first time posting.  I'm in a bit of a pickle financially and could use some unbiased suggestions, feedback, and advice.  Thanks in advance.

Some Backstory:

I graduated from a pretty good (Top 40) college with a STEM degree.  I worked for a few years where I was making 65k+ as an entry level engineer, which is around average for my particular discipline.  Due to some unfortunate events, I was injured and became extremely ill (panic attack disorder, depression, anxiety - along with a permanent physical disability).  Due to the severity of my symptoms I went on disability for a period of time.  When I returned to work part-time, there was a large reduction in workforce and I was laid off.  I have already spoken to a few attorneys and I have no recourse due to the nature of my layoff.  To be honest, I was really struggling at work due to my symptoms and would have left soon thereafter anyways.  I do not qualify for government disability due to the fact that I can work part-time, even if its not my given profession.  I've read this sub enough to know that disability will be a topic of discussion.  I've talked to a few lawyers about government disability insurance and it is not an option.

Current Situation:

I am currently struggling with student loans that I incurred while earning my degree.  I owe approximately $115,000 - $20,000 federal and $95,000 private through Sallie Mae.  A family member co-signed for me when I applied for the loans and the interest rates are approximately 3% (private - variable rate) and 6% (government - fixed rate).  I am currently paying the minimum on all loans.  I deferred for a time but that is no longer an option without some significant paperwork.  I was able to pay more than required while working, but things have become more difficult since getting sick.  

I am currently unable to practice my trade due to my symptoms, which has left me doing freelance jobs that provide little stability.  I might make $1,000 per month if I'm lucky.  It may be possible for me to pursue non-technical professions in the future, but I'm not quite ready yet.

I currently have approximately $7,000 in savings and $41,000 in my IRA/Roth IRA.  I have not dipped into my retirement funds yet.  I have no credit card bills and pay approximately $1,000 per month between car insurance, gas, rent, utilities, food, and the gym.  I own my car outright and my standard of living is on the more modest side of the spectrum - my apartment is well below market average and I rent out a second bedroom to offset some of my monthly costs.  My rental income has been factored into the expenses I listed above.

Question:

I know that my situation does not have an easy solution.  Ideally, I'd like to generate some meaningful income in the near-term.  I am currently working toward that as fast as possible.

Does anyone have advice about what I should do, regarding my loans and monthly cost of living, as I move toward working again?  Does anyone have any other suggestions, in general?

For debt I have 25k in student loans (rate 2.2%), car loan 20k (rate 1.7%) and house for 130k (rate 2.35%). 

I put 6% of my salary into a 401k (100% aggressive), ~200$ month goes into an IRA (50% aggressive), and I am going to start putting money into my children's education funds.

The plan is in 4 years buy a minivan, and also in 4-6 years buy a larger house. I have 2 children and will probably have 2 more over the course of 4 years spacing them 2 years apart. (birth is 4-5k per child)

After all is said and done I will have $1500-$2000 extra a month. 

My main goal in the next ~5 years is to get as much money saved, and sell my current house to buy a bigger one with a loan ranging from 100k-150k. I don't want large monthly payments on any loan especially for my house.

With this money I am risk averse since I know I need to buy a minivan AND want 150k for a down payment on the house (~75k from current house equity and ~75k saved over 5 years). I can stomach a -10k loss but much more over 5 years would put me out of reach of these goals.

After messing around for a few years after high school, working retail and figuring out what I wanted to do with my life, I've decided that I would like to pursue a finance-type career as it's something I've always been interested in and it's probably the only thing I have any amount of innate talent for (I'm one of those average-at-everything, great-at-nothing type people). I quit retail and found an entry level job in banking, I've been there for nearly 5 months now and am really enjoying it. I'm currently waiting to be able to transfer with my job to a nearby city that has a university. It could happen tomorrow or it could be 6 months, it's just a matter of waiting for a position to come up.

Anyway, my plan is to work 4 days per week and attend university part time. In this instance it would take me 5-6 years to complete the degree, depending on whether or not I decide to take a few summer classes. I know that is a long time but I am okay with it. I think that time is a good compromise for me as I have no inclination towards wanting to live like a college student, i.e. poor, roommates, partying, etc. I am past the age of being able to put up with that kind of crap lol.

I have calculated that with the minimum amount I would make at my job, and an overly safe estimation of my expenses, I'd be able to put away about $400 per month minimum. This doesn't include bonuses at work or picking up extra shifts during school vacation time.

I have already got $10k as my emergency fund, have saved up enough to move out and buy furniture, etc.

I suppose the real question here is: What should my priorities be?

I desperately want to buy my own place but I realise that could be a silly move as my job (once I'm graduated) may require me to pick up and move at any time if I want to chase promotions, etc.

Should I focus on saving for a house deposit now so that when I eventually do settle down I will be able to buy? Or should I focus more on retirement savings/investments whilst I am still young?

I should also mention that I am in Australia and student loans work differently here compared to the US. Student loans have no official interest rate, the balance simply rises with inflation. You don't start paying them off until you make over $50k per year, and then the payments come out of your salary at a percentage - kind of the same way tax works. The average cost for a Bachelors degree is about $30k.

personalfinance,Homeowners moving to rented accommodation temporarily... should we keep the original property? (UK),"We are moving from an area with mid/low property prices to an area with extremely high property prices. Even if we got what we wanted for our property (which we won't) we wouldn't be able to afford to buy in our new location for a couple of years at least. So we are going to go into rented accommodation for the next couple of years.

We have had some advice about our property from friends and family. Some say that its best to get rid of the property now because when you come across a new property you want you have cash ready to buy it.

Others say to hold onto our current property for as long as possible as it will (hopefully) rise in value, and we can rent it out and have someone else pay off our mortgage for a couple of years. We can always sell it in the future if we need to, or remortgage to take money out of it if we need to as well.

The thing most people keep coming back to is ""its worth investing in property"" and ""keep hold of all the property that you can"".

So my question is... does it make good financial sense to hold on to property whilst you're renting somewhere else? I guess while we are renting its a ""win/win"" situation, unless we can't rent it out.

Interest rates are low at the moment and if we sold the property and put the money into savings we would be earning max 1.5% on those savings. Plus we would really like to get into the property game at some point and this flat we have at the moment is a great start.

We were doing well for a while, and then a bunch of life changes happened, and now we're not in trouble per se, but we aren't making any progress either. I'm almost 28 and he is 29, and we want to be in a good place financially in 2-3 years to start having kids.

I'm looking for some advice as to how to get back out of the rut we've been in, and refocus our efforts toward saving and paying down debt. I know all the basics of PF, but making changes seems monumentally difficult right now. 


**Jobs/Income:**    
* I work 40 hours per week as a civil engineer, making about 61k/year in salary, take home pay about $1500/biweekly.   
* My husband works close to 50-55 hours per week at three part time jobs, his take home pay is around $30k/year, slightly variable week to week.  **EDITED TO ADD:** This will decrease to around 35-40 hours/week and about $20-25k/year in the fall when he starts classes (he's going to the local community college for a career in HVAC).
 

**Debt:**   
* *Student loan debt*: around $100k between the two of us, minimum monthly payments are about $1100, about half of them are private loans averaging 3%, the rest are federal at about 6-7% interest.  
* *Mortgage debt*: around $67k. Bought the house earlier this year, have just over 20% equity, rate is about 5%. Total cost per month for mortgage, taxes, insurance, etc is about $800/mo.  
* *Credit card debt*: about $8k in credit card debt on a 0% interest card.  Previously balance was $0, but husband lost his previous job right as we were buying the house, so lots of one time expenses went on the credit card.

**Assets**   
* *Cash Savings:* Around $10k in savings on average in a bank account as our emergency fund  
* *Retirement Savings:* Around $41k between a 401k and an IRA. This isn't counting the $10k loan I took out from the account to make the 20% down payment on the house. I'm paying that back to myself at 4% interest every paycheck, and in addition making 5% post-tax contributions to a Roth 401k and receiving a 3% company contribution to regular 401k.  
* *Vehicles:* Both of our vehicles are in good shape. We can expect them to last another 5 years minimum. I was making payments of $200/mo on my car until March of this year (0% interest), but since then have tried to put that $200 into a savings account for future car costs.

So that's where we stand. We have decent assets, but also a lot of debt (as a result our credit scores are excellent, we're both around 760-780). The problem we are having is that I feel like we're barely treading water. The first 6 months of this year were just brutal on our budget. I think the thing that is bothering me most is the $8k in credit card debt - the rest is manageable. But we aren't digging ourselves out of that hole right now, just preventing it from getting any deeper.

personalfinance,"What the hell should I be doing? Dream job, huge student loans, feeling pretty lost. Any help would be much appreciated.","I'm 27 years old, full-time job doing what I love, with a salary of $70k a year, plus another 5-10k in freelance income.

I have a whopping $110,000 of student loan debt, with a monthly payment of $560, but luckily my interest rates are fixed and very low:

Loan 1 - $31,950 - 1.62%

Loan 2 - $33,398 - 1.75%

Loan 3 - $45,230 - 3.75%

I'm 4 years into a 25 year repayment plan.

For the first time in my life, I have no credit card debt, no car payment, no mortgage or any other debt besides the student loans.

My company does not match my 401k, but I recently signed up and am contributing 3%.

I have about $1000 in a normal savings account.

**The catch - I'm living in NYC**, where rent and cost of living are insanely high, and my lifestyle is kind of all over the place.  I do however live within my means and aim to put away a few hundred bucks a month.  

Luckily, I live with my girlfriend and we split a one bedroom for $1300, but that is going to go up to around $1500-$1600 once I'm forced to move to a new apartment in November.  My GF makes significantly less than I do, and I tend to spend a lot to maintain an equal quality of life for the both of us.

If my goal is to ultimately have my own business (very low startup costs), buy a home, get a dog, a car, move to the burbs, etc etc, should I just be dumping money into a savings account?  Cut the 401k without a match and invest in something else?  Gold/Silver, Roth IRA?  Stocks?  I'm willing to take on a moderate to high risk at this point if the reward is right.

I know the student loan debt is intimidating, but at this point it's a fixture, and I've been advised that there's no rush to pay them down because of the high balance, low fixed interest, yearly tax write-off and inflation.

personalfinance,First mortgage questions for my specific situation,"I'm planning on trying to get a mortgage in a year to invest in a rental property to diversify my assets. My credit score right now is 722, but it's sure to go higher. I opened several credit cards in the past several months, so I think that's the reason why it has dipped. I recently got a job at Wells Fargo, where I doubled my previous salary. I'm planning to get a mortgage with Wells Fargo, because I assume I will get favorable interest rates for being an employee. I've also had inconsistent job history due to having temp jobs due to the crappy economy. I'm very frugal with my savings where I save about 75% of my income.

If I apply for the mortgage as a first-time homeowner, but I treat it as a rental property after I secure the loan, are there any negative consequences with this? I feel like there shouldn't, because I already got the loan and I can do what I want with my property. What other aspects about the process am I missing? What else can I do to make sure I get the best rate possible for the mortgage?

I'm expecting to receive help from my dad and grandma with the mortgage. They're probably going to match whatever I put in to the mortgage, so essentially I need 1/3rd of the 20% down payment. In consideration to gift tax, as long as payments to me are made below 10K, the IRS shouldn't be concerned with me and gift tax, right? I feel like they have bigger fishes to worry about than a simple guy like me.

I'm planning on getting a townhouse, because of the pretty good rental income and the good chance of capital apprecation. Best of the both worlds, compared to a single family home or a condo. I live in NOVA, so I hear Tyson's Corner, Chantilly, and Reston are good places to invest in. There is development there, considering the metro lines and job availability.

personalfinance,Good time to buy a (first) house?,"I wasn't particularly looking, but recently a good number of friends and (past) neighbors have been moving into houses. These houses are rather nice, and IMO not badly priced. I'm wondering if it may be a good time to consider buying (investing really) into a house. I currently reside in a rather nice 2BR/1BA apartment by myself for $445/month (water/sewer/trash all included). I've lived in this apartment since May 2012. Here's my layout:

**Age**: 22, Male, Midwest USA

**Education**: Associates in Computer Programming, 12 classes shy of Bachelors in Computer Science.

**Career**: Software Engineer; Salary (Gross): ~$45,000

**Liquid Cash:** (HSA, Paypal, Checking, Savings): ~$16,000

**Retirement Accounts**: (401K, Nationwide 457, Bonds): ~$7,100



***DEBT***

* **Car Loan**: $3,700 (2010 Mazda3)
* **Student Loans**: ~$23,000 

***MONTHLY INCOME***

* **Paycheck**: $2,440 (Net, just received a small raise)

***MONTHLY BILLS***

* **Rent**: $445
* **Electric**: $114 (Budget Billing, Flat Rate)
* **Internet**: $42
* **Cable**: $88.50 (Reducing/Canceling soon - DirecTV)
* **Netflix**: $7.00
* **Cell Phone**: $85
* **Tek Protekt**: $11 (Phone Protection Plan)
* **Food**: ~$400 (Rough Estimate - Varies a lot in Summer)
* **Gas**: ~$100 (Again, Summer causes Variance)
* **Car Loan Payment**: $267 (Minimum)

My current employer is awesome and looking like a gig I will be sticking around with for at least a few years. On the retirement side of things, each paycheck they match up to 6.8% contributions, as well as matching up to $35 into the Nationwide 457 plan (I currently allocate $100 per paycheck pre-tax). They also offer Tuition Reimbursement which I have recently been able to start receiving now that I've been in my position enough time (they cover everything except books, basically). This will help me finish out my Bachelors (will still be taking out Federal loan, just in case) and could potentially pay for my Masters (never really been in my plan, but if someone else is willing to pay for it, hard to not consider...).

If scheduling pans out, I've got at least 1.5yrs remaining to finish out the Bachelor Degree, and as the terms of Tuition Assistance, would need to remain at least 1yr afterwards to not owe back any of the assistant funding. The position I'm in now also has a lot of room for growth.

As for a quick overview of a particular house which caught my eye when I did a search on Realtor.com:

Built in 1984, 2 Car Garage, 3 Beds, 2 Full Bath &amp; 1 1/2 Bath, House is 1,385 Sq. Ft,  Lot is 6,970 Sq. Ft.

*Interior Features*: Dishwasher, Refrigerator, Wood Floors, Garbage Disposer, Stove, Public Utilities, Hood, Walk Out Basement.

* Master Bedroom is 13x11'6
* Living room is 12'7x11'5
* Kitchen is 18'9x9'5
* Laundry room is 7'5x6
* Lot size is less than 1/2 acre
* Parking features: Garage in Basement: 2, In Basement

*Exterior Features*: Built with Brick/Vinyl, Deck which is 10'6 x 10, Patio 30 x 26'6. A shed and a flat concrete area great for use as a Basketball court. Small bit of yard area.

Heating is FAE (not sure what this means honestly, anyone?)/Central cooling.

Lot size is approximately 0.16 acre(s) and 60 x 115

Now granted, I have not looked at this in person (just started internet searching around), but on paper this property offers everything I would be looking for in an upgrade from my 2BR apartment. 

Listed Price is $89,900. This would be my first home purchase, and my family has a long standing relationship with our home bank, so I'm sure I could get a more than fair loan (among other first time buyer credits). No guarantee I'll be in this area in the next 10+ years, but for at least the next 5, I would say it's a safe bet.

I'm writing a book titled ""The Ultimate Guide to Self-Directed Investing &amp; Retirement Planning"" and have it pretty much finished. I have interviewed several experts to help make this book, and have used my personal experience and education to help finish it off. My background is that I have been in the finance, risk management, and real estate realm for the past decade, have an MBA, and am finishing a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) curriculum this year. I've held my life insurance license, and have worked at the largest insurance companies as a risk manager. 

The basic premise of the book is that the entire personal finance and investing world is F*#%ed up and people have lost their ability to invest and make money! Instead, the money goes straight to Wall Street's bottom line, and most folks are left wondering why they never accumulated the wealth they thought was possible. After the Financial Crisis, I began writing this book to help people understand how to amass wealth by taking control of their finances and retirement plan and ""self-directing"" their investments.

Unfortunately, when you are so engrained in your own story and research, you fail to see the forest for the trees. As a result, I'm reaching out to you, Redditors, for assistance in answering the questions you have surrounding self-directed investing and retirement planning. 

Questions I've already answered in the book are:
1. What is retirement, and how did we get to where we are?
2. What is self-directed investing?
3. What types of investment options are available for retirement accounts?
4. What types of retirement accounts are there?
5. How do you take control of retirement plans?
6. What is financial planning and why is it important?
7. How do I invest my retirement plan in real estate?

If you think there are other questions out there surrounding this topic that might be of interest to you, then please let me know. I've given some case studies on how to self-direct retirement plans, and would love more of these as well, so if you know anyone who might want to talk about their retirement planning victories or losses, please send them my way!

If there's anything else you want to see added to the book and think others should know about retirement planning and investing, please post that as well. I'll see if I can get folks that help out a cheap copy of the book without violating Reddit guidelines!",finance,1406156986

I just graduated this past May so my school loans don't kick into effect until November. Currently I am making $80k a year. Here are my expenses.

Big Bills


* $65k in school loans. 
* $31k of those loans are at a fixed rate of 3.4%
* $34k of those loans are at different interest rates but remain the same. They range from 3.4% to 6.8%

---------------

* $4200 credit card - has interest
* $5400 credit card - no interest until next year
* $1500 left on car payment
* $1200 mattress - You spend 1/3 of your life sleeping, it's a whole different world out there with a good mattress :) Also, no interest for 1 year


---------------
Monthly Bills

* $1750 for rent - this is very high but I am looking at getting a roommate next year
* $200 utilities 
* $115 for cable and internet
* $300 a month for food
* $300 insurance - health, dental, car, vision
* $50 clothes
* $150 gas

**$2865 for total monthly bills**

I get paid $3333 two times a month. I have a 15% federal income tax, 4% state tax, 6% social security tax so that adds up to $1666 a month in taxes. That leaves me with $5k-$2865(monthly expenses)= **$2135 left over a month to spend**. So here is my logic with what to do.

I first need an emergency fund built up so I was going to put $2k directly from my relocation bonus into that. I used my credit cards to survive my last year of college because I didn't ask for enough in my loans. I also used one of my credit cards for my relocation expenses. 

After I contribute to my emergency fund I have a variety of options with what I can do with that remaining $2100. I really want my high interest credit card paid off before my loans kick in so I believe I can get that paid off in 3 months max I'd say. I will then go for my car and then my other credit card. I think I will just keep paying the minimum amount for the mattress until my credit cards are paid off because the mattress isn't making any interest. My employer matches 4% for my 401k so I will do a full match which would be $133 a paycheck(x2 for monthly). I will also put in another 300-500 a month for my emergency fund.

If I get my credit cards and mattress paid off before November I should be in good shape in order to start paying my school loans. I really want to get rid of them fast so I am going to pay off the high interest first. I'm think of putting $1k a month to start with and see if I can afford more in the later months. My ideal plan is to get them paid off in under 5 years. 

I know that the elephant in the room right now is my rent. I just moved to a new city and I didn't know anyone so I got a one bedroom for that price. It's only a 10 month lease so once it's over I am hoping to get some roommates so the max I will be spending on rent would be around 700-1000 a month.

If you guys could recommend a better path to spend the $2135 a month plus the remaining $2k from my relocation bonus then I am all ears. I basically will start with my credit cards and work my way up from there. Thanks for reading and your help!",finance,1406168183
personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage now or let it ride?,"Hi everyone. I'm a long-time lurker, first time poster. Hope I'm doing this right...

I'm in my mid 30's. Make around $100K per year. The only debt I have is a mortgage on an investment rental property I bought 4 years ago.

I owe about $84K on the house. The rent I get from tenants pays the mortgage and then some. However, I do have enough cash saved up to pay it all off now.

Should I...

A) Pay off the house and use the rent I generate from the investment property to buy another investment property. (Combined the two rents from both investment properties can help me pay off the 2nd property faster). Once the second is paid off, I can buy a 3rd and use the rents from all 3 to pay the third even faster than the second (sort of like a domino effect).

or 

B) Let the investment property continue to pay off itself -- over the 30 year term of the mortgage. Meanwhile, take advantage of low interest rates by using the $84K I would have used to pay off the property to place down payments on 2 or 3 additional investment properties. Then, also let them ride for the full 30 year term of the mortgage.

Seems to me option A allows me to use money earned right away, while option B is sort of the long game. In essence, I wont reap the benefit of option B until I'm in my 60's... which doesn't sound very appealing. 

Any advice out there on what to do? Maybe I'm not seeing an option C (a cross between the two)?

personalfinance,Rather urgent financial advice needed regarding Student Loans,"First off, thanks for taking a look.. I am a 25 year old military veteran looking to start school at my local community college where tuition for the semester runs $2981.00.

I am a little strapped for cash &amp; savings, and because of my income last year, I did not qualify for financial aid this year. My main issue is that I need to come up with this tuition money by Aug 8th. I feel like I'm over complicating things thinking about the right way to go, and I'd greatly appreciate your opinions.

Options (that I can think of):

1) apply for a federal student loan, of $4000 at around 7-8% interest.

2) apply for a personal loan through my credit union for the same amount at the same interest rate.

3) withdraw my federal employee retirement savings (TSP) either for the $4000 or in full (~$32k). It has averaged 21.6% gain over the the last 12-months, so I'm not eager to do this, not to mention incurring taxes. I would not be able to contribute to this account again, unless through a Traditional IRA roll-over.

4) Sell my vehicle at around $14,000. ~~Again, incurring taxes~~

Kicker** I could join the reserve component of my former military branch with a $10,000 signing bonus ($5k up front) for a six year contract. In which, I would immediately pay off any of the loans. Although I have concerns about how this would affect my credit score.

If you're thinking ""why doesn't he just use his GI Bill?"", as foolhardy as it sounds, I'm trying extremely hard to reserve this for a Graduate degree.

My rent is $1600(wayyy below median rent in my city), with all my other bills total monthly expenses should be around $2500. That leaves ~$5k/month I'll be saving up. What do I do with this money?

My plan is to continue to live frugally, buy investment properties and rent them out. I figure at $5k/month I can put a $60k downpayment on a place every 12 months or so and renting it out will be easy(this part I'm not worried about). It just has to be doable and make financial sense.

Is this a good plan? Should I be investing my money elsewhere? Not sure how to make the most out of my situation here.

Also, according to a salary calculator federal withholding taxes will cost me $2.8k/month. Anything I can do to reduce this?",finance,1406174636

Currently I take home 8500 a month. 
I have a credit card at $18,000/$20,000 and a line of credit at $22,000/$25,000.

personalfinance,Excess Medical School Finances,"Hello, I'll be starting med school in a couple of weeks. I have my loans (all federal), apartment, and everything that I could think of beforehand set, but I was wondering if there is something that I did not think of that I should be doing to manage my finances either now or in the future.

Currently I have $13,000 in undergraduate debt and am going to borrow about **$53,000 annually** for the next four years disregarding cost increases. After paying for school/fees that leaves me with about **$2,700 monthly**. With what I think are pretty high estimates with some numbers pulled off the internet, monthly I should be looking at about **$1,500 in expenses**.

That leaves me every month with about **$1,200** ($14,300 annually). That's about 27% of my loans. Is that too much? Should I request less of what was offered? I've never been one to waste money, but I'v also never lived completely on my own (housing/meal plan/negligible driving during college). I was thinking of just taking it all to be safe and then immediately putting the excess into paying off the loan at the end of the year, but that would be a loss of about $1,500 (1.072% and 4.288% fees) relative to eliminating my PLUS loan and reducing the others if my math is right.

[Here are a bunch of numbers](http://i.imgur.com/hacukSg.png)

The school prohibits working during classes, so I won't start paying anything off for at least four years during residency. Is there anything that I should be doing to minimize my costs? I also noticed that my subsidized loans (RIP) have started accruing interest. Was that a mistake? I thought that would not happen until after graduate school as well, and if it is a mistake, do I have a chance of stopping that and getting that whopping $41 back? In the future, should I pay off my newer loans first because of the higher interest rates?

I also have about $800 in cash and I've been paying for everything for ~2 years with a 1% cash back credit card with a limit of $2,800 that immediately pays off monthly to avoid the 15.15% APR. I get health insurance through my parents, and the car is paid off.

I'm about to receive some quarterly bonus pay (~$10k, after tax) at work that doesn't factor into my regular monthly budget. I am also a night student in the process of getting their MBA, so while I have student debt, I will also take about $20k more in loans over the next year. I effectively receive a bonus every 3 months, but they alternate between ~$2-3k and ~$10k every other bonus.

2. Car Loan - $6.8k @ 3.78% ($250 a month)

I have a small emergency fund, and no other debts except for a credit card I pay off every month. While mathematically, it makes the most sense to put the entire chunk on loan 1, it seems like being able to eliminate 1 debt payment would have positive monthly cash flow benefits along with some psychological ones.

news,TOO MANY INNOCENTS GETTING THE DEATH PENALTY!,"Thursday, July 24th, 2014
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

TOO MANY INNOCENTS GETTING THE DEATH PENALTY!

There is a reason the death penalty is rarely enforced anymore, particularly in the federal judicial system.  Too many innocent victims are being convicted, based on cover-ups and the withholding of exculpatory evidence by some federal and state prosecutors.  A recent study published in the National Academy of Sciences concludes that some 4.1 percent of inmates on death row are innocent.  More than four percent.  If that were the rate of airplanes crashing, would you fly? 

Legal scholar John Whitehead, who writes about the pursuit of justice for The Rutherford Institute, and who has appeared on my nationally syndicated radio program, says the criminal justice system in the U.S. is consistently error-bound and flawed.  He writes of a recent Columbia University study on 5,760 capital cases where “the report found an overall error rate of 68%.  In other words, courts found serious reversible errors in nearly 7 out of 10 capitol cases….with the most common errors involved prosecutorial  suppression of evidence and other misconduct.”

Receiving the death penalty is a regular occurrence in my home state of Louisiana.  What also is becoming the norm is the fact that a number of those convicted, and on their way to the gas chamber, are eventually found to be innocent.  For years, the Bayou State has held the title of having the highest incarceration rate in the world.  It now has taken on the dubious title of having case after case of death row inmates being convicted based on the withholding of evidence that would prove their innocence.

New Orleans has become the cesspool for the innocent being convicted of capital crimes and sentenced to death.  One of the most egregious is the case of New Orleanian John Thompson, who was convicted back in 1982 of first-degree murder and given the death sentence.  He came within days of being executed after spending 14 years on death row and 18 year’s total in prison.  Five different prosecutors were involved in the case and all knew that a blood test and other key evidence had been hidden that showed Thompson was innocent.
On his deathbed and dying of cancer, one of the prosecutors confessed to a colleague that he had hidden the exculpatory blood sample.  The colleague waited five more years before admitting that he too knew of the hidden evidence.  Thompson, after 18 years, received a new trial, and his lawyers were finally able to produce ten difference pieces of evidence that had been kept from Thompson, that overwhelming showed he was innocent.  The new jury took less than 35 minutes to find him not guilty.
Hiding evidence that can find the accused innocent is nothing new for prosecutors in New Orleans, both in state and federal court as well as with the FBI. The Innocence Project of New Orleans reviewed a number of convictions over the past 25 years in the city and concluded that prosecutors have a “legacy” of suppressing evidence. The Project said 36 men convicted in Orleans Parish alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Nineteen have since had their sentences overturned or reduced as a result. In 19 of 25 capital cases, the prosecutors withheld favorable evidence.

Then there is the chilling case of Dan Bright, convicted and put on death row for a murder he did not commit. Evidence came out years after his conviction that the FBI, thanks to a credible informant, had been in possession of the name of the actual killer all along. Luckily for Bright, because of the unconstitutional withholding of key evidence by the prosecution and the FBI, his conviction was thrown out, and he now is a free man.
The foreman of White’s jury, who recommended that he be put to death, was Kathleen Norman, who was a guest on my radio show on several occasions before her untimely death several years ago.  She was so incensed over White’s wrongful conviction and the hiding of evidence that would have cleared him by the FBI, that she became head of the Louisiana Innocence project, helping others like White mount a credible defense.

Questionable conduct by rogue prosecutors who withhold information that could prove the innocence of an accused is far too prevalent.  Whether one is for or against the death penalty, there is ample evidence that convictions of a capital crime can be a crapshoot based on the whims of some prosecutors who too often withhold exculpatory evidence.  Tough luck if you are innocent.  Too often, justice is being compromised.  And that’s just not right!

personalfinance,Are Roth IRA withdrawals within the same year as contributions tax free?,"A couple of months ago, in this calendar year, I contributed $1,500 to my Roth IRA. I didn't invest it, so it still is worth only $1,500. I now need $1000 back, and so started to [fill out a distribution \(withdrawal\) form.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1O3hl.jpg)


I was afraid at first that I would have to pay 10% in taxes on the withdrawal, but I found [a passage in the IRS Roth IRA publication][1] that seems to exempt withdrawals in the same year as they were deposited from any taxes, unless income was earned on them.


&gt; If you withdraw contributions (including any net earnings on the contributions) by the due date of your return for the year in which you made the contribution, the contributions are treated as if you never made them. If you have an extension of time to file your return, you can withdraw the contributions and earnings by the extended due date. The withdrawal of contributions is tax free, but you must include the earnings on the contributions in income for the year in which you made the contributions.


However, I couldn't find any reference to this online, when looking up rules about IRA distributions. I was wondering that I did read this correctly, does it in fact mean I don't have to withhold anything for the Federal and if I would still have to withhold anything in MA.

A few other things:


House:

I bought my house a year ago. It was literally a dump! It was in terrible shape and most of my current creditcard debt has gone towards renovation costs. I paid $68,000 for it and put $3000 down. 

I've done alot of work on it, so I've been wondering if it would be worth re-mortgaging or getting a HELOC or something to consolidate everything?

Auto Loan:

I live/work in the middle of nowhere! I'm in northern Canada and having a 4x4 is essential not only because of where I live, but where I work (A mining company)

I was stupid when I bought my first car. I took out a $12,000 to buy a used car. The interest rate was insane, I think it was around %29. (I was 18, no co-signer, little work history, 0 down)

The car eventually died, so I bought a newer SUV that cost $24,000. I still owed over 9k on the old car, so I rolled that into the new SUV. However, I didnt pay enough attention and ended up getting put into a balloon loan for the SUV. When I had less then a year left on the SUV I decided to trade in for a new car, but quickly found out I still owed over $12,000 because of the remaining balance/the amount in the balloon portion. 

So I rolled that into a brand new car. I kept that car for 3 years and was paying something stupid like $570 a month. The car took a beating driving into the mine I work at everyday and eventually the motor went on it. Luckily I still had 1k of warranty left and the engine was replaced at no cost to me!! I quickly decided to trade it in since I knew the shape it was in and that it wouldn't last much longer. I also figured I'd get a good trade in value for it with the new engine/warranty remaining. 

Cue the truck. I ended up getting like 20k for a trade in value for the car. I forget the exact amount I paid for the truck, but I still owe $52k as of today on it. Clearly this is my biggest/worse expense, but I also consider it essential. 

Girlfriend:

I do live with my girlfriend. She helps out where she can, but her income is sporadic and unreliable. Right now shes getting great hours and its been awesome, but I can't bank on her for contributing much. I typically get $400 a month out of her though to help with expenses.

Thats pretty much all the essential stuff I can think of at the moment.

Basically I am tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I've become so miserable because everyday I have to worry about making ends meet. My g/f wants to do things all the time or go out, but I always have to make up excuses because I just cant afford it! 

I need help and don't know where to start!

On a side note, I just received $500 bucks today for the sale of a domain I own! So that will be going towards something immediately!!

personalfinance,[US] How are payments applied for federal loans,"So I borrowed a fair amount of money to put myself through school, and now that I am graduated and am starting a career in a well-paying field I am content with my decision and should be able to pay off my debt fairly sufficiently, once I enter repayment in November.

My question is, for federal loans, how are payments applied? I have various loans at different interest rates, as specified below, but (I assume) only get one bill from my servicer.

Will payments be applied completely to the highest interest debt first? Or is there still a hidden ""minimum payment"" for each individual loan, and only excess will apply to the highest interest rate first? When I am accounting for the loans in, say, the debt payoff calculator posted today, should I put each loan in as a separate loan, or just input the total loan amount with a principal-weighted interest rate?

 I know that with the avalanche method the goal is to target the loan with the highest interest rate. But what if the loans have the same interest rate? I have a variety of different loans that have 6.8%, 5% and 4.5%. For example, I have 2 loans. Loan #1 has $1250 total and Loan #2 is $4673. Both have an interest rate of 6.8%.

personalfinance,"Taking out my first loan as a student, looking for advice","I'm a 20 year old male computer science student at a large top-20 state university. I'm going into my third year, and I ran into a financial problem due to my last job, so I will need to take out it a loan. Basically my employer never paid me, and kept lying to me. I had to quit and move back home across the country to live with my parents due to this. I was depending on this money for school/rent/living expenses, so now I am quite screwed. I start a new job in 2 weeks, and I will be able to work it part-time through the school year as well. The problem is I need to move back to the city where I go to college, and I don't even have enough money for the first month of rent. My parents offered to help, and we have a really good relationship, but I don't want to depend on them long-term. Here is an outline of my situation.

- Current savings: 1k
- Need to move by: 1st week of August
- Estimated rent: TBD, likely $600/mo + $600 security deposit
- Total monthy living cost:  $700/mo
- Estimated take home pay (August): $2300
- Estimated take home per (part-time/school year): $800
- Amount legally owed by previous employer, will be collected within 3 months: $8500
- Tuition for Fall 2014/Spring 2015: $9800 total
- Current loans: $5000 Federal student (subsidized/unsub.) due after graduation

Other info:
I have an old car but won't be bringing it, I plan to live close to campus and bike/walk to work. The tuition above is without federal/state aid, which I'm guessing will be atleast $500/semester (not sure since I'm transferring and can't compare it to last semester). I've had solid job offers in the past, but I made a risky decision to work for a startup that didn't pay me - I shouldn't have any problem making $10k or so next summer and having a 85k+ job lined up after I graduate... More concerned about the short term ... completely broke now and I need money to move.

Anyway, I'm just looking for advice on my situation. I need to move within the next week or two and I won't have the funds to do so - I'm fine with taking out a small loan, but I'm not sure how to do it and where I should take it out, and if it will come through in time. Seriously this money within a week or two, if I don't get it I might need to look for another job and might not be able to go to school.

If I were to take an early distribution of $19,000 from the account my penalty and taxes would be as follows(?):

10% Early withdrawal Penalty=1,900

For State and Federal taxes I am calculating my annual income by combining 19,000 and 33,000= 52,000.  From 52K  I subtract what my tax would have been without the early distribution.

(Annual Income+Distribution)-(Annual Income without Distribution)= new taxes

Additional State Tax: ($4457)-( $2747)=$1710

Additional Federal Tax: ($5,331)-(2381)= $2950

I'm 22 years old, a new 0-1 (officer, 2nd Lieutenant) in the Marines, and very uninformed financially (though I've been prowling around here and other places trying to build up some background knowledge).

 I'm looking for a good way to start my career financially, and establish credit. Please feel free to completely tear down my current plans, as there's zero experience/concrete knowledge behind them.

-    0-1 Pay: ~$44,000 annually before taxes (my PEBD is July 2011). I commissioned this past June, and go active early this September. 
-     I have no college debt
-     I own my vehicle outright (just bought a '95 Corolla in cash)
- Currently my only recurring payment is ~$525/yr in USAA Auto Insurance (no comprehensive/collision, maximum medical/uninsured/property damage payouts). I plan on paying for the full year upfront
- I plan on putting 12-15% of each paycheck into a Roth TSP (leaning towards 15% due to lack of debt/other payments)
- I have checking and savings accounts at BofA, USAA, and Navy Federal, total funds currently ~$6,500 (+/- $500). Debit cards for each checking account, plus USAA also sent me an ATM card for whatever reason.  
- I am eligible for the $25,000 USAA Loan at 2.99% APR, and also a $4,000 AAFMAA Loan @1.5% APR (but this requires me to take out $250,000 of term life insurance - I'm single, no kids, so wasn't planning on taking any life insurance). 

In order to establish credit, my father (not a financial wizard) advised me to take out a small amount from one of the aforementioned loans and allow the re-payment to start establishing my credit. A military finance officer disagreed and recommended I instead go for a low-limit, no annual fee credit card. I'm inclined to agree with the 3404. He also recommended I pull my credit report - where should I do that from? 

I understand paying the card off in full every month so that I never see the interest - that would be my plan. With that said, I've never had a credit card before - do you recommend any cards from USAA, NFCU, or BofA? Looking for no annual fees. 

- Looking at these two cards from NFCU/USAA.. both have no annual fee, and claim to be lowest rate they offer.

- I plan on only using for small monthly purchases (groceries, the like) to establish credit and pay in full every month. Only real difference I've discerned thus far is that NavyFed has no balance transfer fees.
- I'm currently leaning towards the NFCU Platinum VISA, though I don't have particularly strong reasons for doing so

business,"UPS and FedEx owned by a large number of the same institutional companies, why is this considered legal?","Under a recent announcement that will cost small businesses a lot of money when shipping, especially those shipping large items with low weight such as pillows, both UPS and FedEx decided to move to dimensional weight for all their shipments.  

Under this new adjustment which before the threshold was around 5100 cubic inches or 5100/166 (dim factor) 30 lbs on a ground package was where they started calculating dimensional weight for ground packages.  

If you said your packaged was 5 lbs but under the calculation it was actually 15 lbs, you would still be charged the rate of a 5 lb package to ship.  In January everyone will be charged dimensional weight for every shipment.... so this person mentioned above would now be charged the rate of 15 lbs even though the item shipped may weight only 5 lbs.  

Both companies are encouraging companies to adjust their packaging before the switch, but the companies also have guidelines for packaging when filing a claim.   So, a claim does not get approved if insufficient packaging is the cause.  

FedEx announced this first, You would think this would be a great opportunity to win business from FedEx by highlighting this to the customer's of FedEx, but when you look at the Institutional Holders of both companies:

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ups/institutional-holdings

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fdx/institutional-holdings

At least 15% of both companies are held by the same companies just from page 1.  Without looking at all pages of over 800 institutional investors for both companies, we can probably assume that at the very least 40-50% of both companies are held by the same institutional investors.  

When Institutional Investors have a large stake in a company, they have a guy or several guys/girls on the board.  

Both companies are basically the same, when one company comes out with something, the other company follows suit in almost every instance.

In this industry, there are two competitors who hold the lions share of the market, then USPS who get what is left over.  Regional carriers get some business, but these companies control the nations shipping.  

An increase in cost in shipping from these two companies will likely raise the price of a number of goods throughout the country.  Everything will not apply but many items will apply to the dimensional threshold.

Is there really no law on the books that prevents this from happening?  if Two companies control a market and those companies are controlled by the same companies behind the scenes, how is that different from an outright monopoly?  

These companies don't even compete with each other any more they simply copy one another.  Their major hubs are less than 400 miles from each other one in Tennessee the other in Kentucky.

personalfinance,Canadian taking out a loan for one semester of school in the US,"Hi everyone.

I went to school in Canada and did lots of internships, which payed for tuition. I graduated with zero debt.

I then started a PhD program in the United States, which was supported with a stipend and tuition payed for. I'm saving about 18% of my income, but it's not a lot, obviously.

I recently decided that the program wasn't for me. To get my Masters degree, I need one more semester of classes. This is worthwhile and important to me for reasons I don't want to get into.

Here's the problem: to support myself, I need roughly $ 24 000 USD for tuition and living expenses. I have limited experience with banking and personal finance, and I've never had to take out a loan before. This is a brand new experience for me, and I'm a bit lost.

Here's the break-down:

I'm a 24 year old.

**Expenses**:

* $ 880 USD/month for rent.
* $ 900 USD/month for everything else (food, entertainment, expenses, etc).

**Canadian funds (in a large Canadian bank)**:

* $ 15 000 CAD in a checking account. I had planned this to be necessary for living expenses over the PhD, but obviously plans changed.
* $ 5000 CAD in a tax-free savings accounts.

**American funds** (in a large American bank):

* $ 10 000 USD in a checking account.
* $ 3500 USD in a low-interest savings account

**Projected earnings**:

* My earning potential upon graduation is about $ 100 000, conservatively. More if I work in the US, maybe less in Canada.

Since I've been in *student mode*, I haven't educated myself about investing. I know I could be making better decisions about my money.

**Questions**:

* *Where should I go to get a loan?* I'm Canadian with a student VISA in the states. I'm assuming a private bank is best. Can I borrow USD from a Canadian bank? Should I?
* *How much of the roughly $24k should I pay directly from my finances now, and how much should I borrow?* From which accounts? Why?
* *What sort of interest rates should I expect?*
* *If I try to talk to somebody in a bank about my options, will they be biased in the bank's best interests over mine?*

**Also**:

* I'm fairly risk averse, and I know more money is coming after I get settled. What are good resources to make learn how to make good decisions with my money? Books?
* How do I find a financial advisor, or learn about what to look for in a FA?

I know this question is... comprehensive. Feel free to answer selective bits.

Here is my income/expenditure breakdown:
After rent/bills/food and $400 dollars into emergency savings every month I am left with $1120

I have $4000 in savings currently and would like to bring this to about $7000.

Credit Card Balance	4,215.34	?
Chase Student Loan	8,250.00	4.96%
Federal Loans	35,000.00	3.86%
Sallie Mae	30,167.00	9.25%
Car loan	16335.94	4.99%

personalfinance,Help! I don't know what to do! (Paying off debts),"I am in a situation in which I need some advice on paying off some debts. I have just been given a roughly $6500 trust fund check and need to pay off debt. I am clueless what to do next. I already contribute around $300 extra per month towards paying these bills off. 
Here are my debts and interest rates. All of them are near or at their limit. 
-Credit Card #1: $2,381/3,000 balance @ 9.9% 
-Credit Card #2: $1,443/2,500 balance @ 21.24%
-Credit Card #3: $1,426/1,500 balance @ 16.99%
-Personal Loan: $2,000, no interest or payments (to a relative)
-Auto Loan: $7,338 balance @ 4.1%, payment $300

I have two schools of thought on how I could use the money to pay off the debt. 
#1 - I can pay off the auto loan (making up the difference with money I have in savings), freeing up another $300 from the payment, totaling $600 towards paying the credit cards and other debt. 

#2 - I can pay off all of the credit cards plus about half of the personal loan, leaving the auto loan and the $300 a month toward that. This way I probably pay less in interest and essentially get out of ""bad"" debt.

1) Buy the apartment now, live in it mortgage free, have a lower weekly expenditure, keep on saving money but probably move onto a larger house in 5 to 10 year's time (who knows if the RE market will outstrip the growth in my savings?)

employer 401k contribution: 7% (regardless of my own contribution) paid at the end of the year
Last year, my total income from the job was roughly $155k

I maximize my own 401k contribution at $17,500
I have two Roth IRAs, one for myself, one for my spouse, she works very part time (maybe $150/month income - negligible). I maximize contributions to both Roth IRAs, so $5500/year each

I also run a side business of repairing and maintaining cars, which brings in very little profit, as I do it mostly for fun and to be able to write off tools, last year the business essentially broke even, as I spent all the profits on tools. However this year, business is picking up and I might make a little money from it.

I'm married, filing  jointly, have one kid. I'm above the threshold for being able to deduct contributions to a traditional IRA and I think I'm getting close to the threshold for being able to contribute to Roth IRAs (not sure he exact limits, but last time I checked, this was the case).

I'm wondering if I can also set up a SEP IRA for my business and direct any profits to that, so that I can increase my tax advantaged savings?

My regular job has full medical insurance paid, so I do not believe I'm qualified for an HSA or any other tax advantaged savings accounts.

My goal is to minimize my taxable burden and to maximize my retirement savings. Thoughts on SEP IRA, or any other tax shelters I can take advantage of?

For reference, my monthly budget is roughly $3000 which includes $1860 Mortgage/tax/insurance on my house (15 year fixed at 3.5%), phone, car insurance, student loan payment, utilities and groceries. No debts other than student loans, which is $10k at 2% interest - even though I can't write off the student loan interest due to my income (or not much of it), this interest rate is ridiculously low, so I don't pay much extra towards it.

Steve Forbes being interviewed about his new book, this was part of his answer to a question about dollar alternatives: Gold, Silver, Bitcoin.

&gt; In one sense, Bitcoin is a high-tech cry for help. Trying to create what they call ""crypto-currencies."" Online currencies. Because they don't trust the dollar, they don't trust the Federal Reserve. Now what Bitcoin's doing that's a little different from others is that its creating a payment system that in many ways is much more efficient than the system we have now. So I see it less as a money phenomenon, and more as a payment process system. You know, give PayPal a run for it's money.

personalfinance,Federal government employees- how do you count your FERS contribution as money saved for retirement?,"Currently we put in 3.2% and the goverment puts in 9%, but the payouts are set based on years in service and salary upon retirement.  What if you don't plan to stay in for 10 years, you get a refund for your contribution, but I think you don't get any interest on that 3.2% you've been saving.  In this case, I would expect you just consider the 3.2% as having been saved earning 0% interest I guess.  

 And what if you plan to leave the government right after 10 yrs of service.  Would you account that as still only saving 3.2% towards retirement, or would you count it as more than that since some of your pension is presumably coming from the government's contributions.",finance,1406308913

I'm a 22 year old female who has been residing in NYC since 2011. I have worked part/full-time for the same business since that year and have had money withheld every paycheck. On my 2013 W-2, it states my wages,tips, other comp. was around 17300. My federal tax withheld was about 750, social security withheld was about 1000 and Medicare was 250.

I don't have any permanent and almost no proof of address as I have been subletting month-to-month for years through Craigslist. My license is a Florida state issued ID. I have basically nothing to show for myself other than my W-2's and personal information on my bank statements.

I would be grateful if anyone could answer these questions:

If I had a parent claiming me as a dependent for the two years before I turned 21, could I still try to file my returns from those years?

Once you start filing your taxes are you ever able to stop? (Even if you left your job and state?) I will be quitting and moving away soon.

If I file returns from the past three years, what should I expect? 

Is this something I can do at home or do I need to seek the help of a professional or an IRS office?

personalfinance,My instinct is to throw everything at Student Loan payments. Am I wrong?,"Hello, everybody. Here's the gist.

I'm a recent college grad with a less than lucrative degree. 20, living at home, about 37k in loans. They go into repayment in November.


Private Loan: 

* 14,574.21 at 6.99%

Federal Loans (all unsubsidized): 

* 4,135 at 6.8%

* 2,383 at 6.8%

* 2,534 at 6.8%

* 2,227 at 6.8%

* 3,027 at 6.8%

* 5,643 at 3.9%

* 2,052 at 3.9%

* Total/Average: 21,981 at 5.8%


I also owe my mother 2,400, but I don't have to pay this back immediately. (""Pay off the ones with interest before you worry about me,"" she says. Thanks Mom)


I plan on paying off the interest on the loans before it capitalizes, which will be 4-5k by November.
My payments will be about 450 (combined) on standard repayment plans.

I currently work 2 part time jobs. 

* Job 1: 150-175 a week, after taxes

* Job 2: 275 a week, after taxes 

* Total: ~1700 each month (4 weeks) This is take home. 

* Savings: 3,800

* Stocks: ~10k

If I can find one, I'm also looking to get a third job for nights/weekends, as my current two jobs fill up the typical 9-5 work day, or do odd jobs as I can. I like to keep busy and did so during college, so this would not be an added stress. 


I have no other debts other than the student loans. However, I currently drive a truck that's nearing the end of it's life, and I will need to get a 'new' vehicle, likely a small car, within the next year. The truck as it is has a trade-in value of about 1-2k. 

Monthly Expenses: 

* Gas: ~400, lots of commuting coupled with poor gas mileage on the truck.

* Insurance: 115 (690 every six months)

* Food/Misc: 150

* Phone: 55

* Minimum Loan Payment: 450 (starting November)


I live at home, and rent's not a current issue. 

I want to sustain an emergency fund of 3-4k, but this may dip depending on the timing of the lightly used car purchase. My goal is to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible because frankly they scare me.


My questions are:

1. Should I cash out the stock and throw it at loans?

2. Should I save for a lightly used car and buy it outright, or throw everything at student loans and get a loan for the car? (I imagine this will depend on interest rates?) My hope is to trade the truck in while it still has some worth, likely after the winter because 4-wheel drive is a savior in snow. 

3. Is there anything blatantly apparent that I'm not taking into consideration or that I should be asking?

5500 Subsidized @ 3.86%
10,000 Subsidized @ 3.4%
10,000 Perkins Loan @ 5%

Then I have a car that i just bought for about 21,000 after tax and fees with 3,000 down at 3.4% so debt is roughly $18,000 @ 3.4%.

I have a credit card, but I pay it off in full every month so theres no debt there.

Bitcoin,Open Letter to NYSDFS Regarding Mr. Ben Lawsky,"Let me preface by saying that I have read most of Ben Lawsky's proposals. While I disagree with much of their content, I do not intend to attack Mr. Lawsky's opinions, only to offer my own viewpoints. One of the first facts we should face is that anything may happen if Mr. Lawsky is able to commit senseless acts of treason against anyone daring to challenge his rotten ruminations. Linguacious grumpy-types may revive an arcadian past that never existed. The worst classes of demented nincompoops there are may brandish the word “theologicohistorical” (as it is commonly spelled) to hoodwink people into believing that the majority of unsavory philopolemical-types are heroes, if not saints. And confused, larcenous prima donnas may deny that Mr. Lawsky twists every argument into some sort of “struggle” between bitcoin users and the federal government. Mr. Lawsky unvaryingly constitutes the underdog party, which is what he claims gives him the right to demand that loyalty to grotty personæ non gratæ supersedes personal loyalty. I'll go over that again: This makes me fearful that I might someday find myself in the crosshairs of his counterproductive taradiddles.

We can't stop Mr. Lawsky's ridiculous proposals overnight. It takes time, patience and experience to stand by our principles and be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost. Despite the fact that unless we express our concerns about his brazen treatises, no real changes will ever occur, unlike the usual, carnaptious, garden-variety hypochondriac, Mr. Lawsky has been trying desperately hard to make the case that he's a tribune of the oppressed. Sorry, Mr. Lawsky, but I must respectfully disagree. My counterargument is that Mr. Lawsky wants us to believe that public opinion is a reliable indicator of what's true and what isn't. How stupid does he think we are? The answer to that question has broad implications. For example, Mr. Lawsky has hatched all sorts of self-deceiving plans. Remember his attempt to supplant one form of injustice with another? No? That's because Mr. Lawsky is so good at concealing his odious, poxy activities.

Mr. Lawsky used to maintain that we have too much freedom. However, after my last letter so eloquently put a lie to that, Mr. Lawsky and his forces have busily if rather quietly gone to work on their palinodes—amending here, canceling there, and generally trying to conceal the fact that Mr. Lawsky's hijinks are not witty satire, as he would have you believe. They're simply the venom-spouting, choleric ramblings of someone who has no idea or appreciation of what he's mocking. I'm at loggerheads with him on at least one important issue. Namely, Mr. Lawsky argues that drug money is being used to pay for the construction of huge underground cities for bitcoin dwellers. I take the opposite position, that it's often hard to decipher Mr. Lawsky's logorrheic comments. Obviously, he flees clarity whenever it involves unpleasant shouldering of responsibility, but I believe that in this case, Mr. Lawsky is typical of jackbooted theologasters in his wild invocations to the irrational, the magic, and the fantastic to dramatize his assertions.

Mr. Lawsky and his bootlickers are, by nature, self-pitying babblers. Not only can that nature not be changed by window-dressing or persiflage, but if you spend much time listening to Mr. Lawsky's trash talk you'll inevitably hear the term “physicophilosophical” thrown around. Usually Mr. Lawsky hurls that word as an epithet, a way of accusing someone of preventing the production of a new crop of fork-tongued, mingy bottom-feeders or of doing something else of which Mr. Lawsky disapproves. More accepted usage of the word, however, is to describe the manner in which Mr. Lawsky had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, he gave us narcissism, exclusivism, and factionalism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since if we look beyond Mr. Lawsky's delusions of grandeur, we see that he avers that corporatism can quell the hatred and disorder in our society. As you can no doubt determine from comments like that, facts and Ben Lawsky are like oil and water.

A brief study of sociology will show one inescapable fact: My goal is to focus on what unites rather than divides us. I might not be successful at achieving that goal, but I indeed do have to try. Sure, Mr. Lawsky can fabulize about how he knows the “right” way to read Plato, Maimonides, and Machiavelli. That doesn't change the fact that he keeps trying to interfere with the most important principles of democracy. And if we don't remain eternally vigilant, he will really succeed. No one that I speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. Of course, I don't speak or correspond with selfish jokers, Mr. Lawsky's votaries, or anyone else who fails to realize that in asserting that his sentiments are not worth getting outraged about, Mr. Lawsky demonstrates an astounding narrowness of vision. This letter has gone on far too long in my opinion and probably yours as well. So let me end it by saying merely that Mr. Ben Lawsky's incessant word-mongering makes me think that it is totally ridiculous that I have to be faced with proponents of clericalism whose mean-spirited ideals are treated with apathy.",cryptocurrency,1406331907

If the remaining balance will be absolved in the 120 month period (you must make 120 seperate payments) then it seems pointless for me to throw anything more at it than the minimum payments.

Last week, I set up an installment agreement with the IRS, paying ~$120 a month

I make around $70k/year, around $2000 biweekly after taxes.  

I plan to spend every penny on clearing credit card debt first since I'm doing 22% APR.. which is killer.  

If I spend money on absolutely nothing but credit card debt (and minimum student loan/IRS payments), it'd take me about 5 months. But I have rent/food/etc.

I spend around $500-600 on food monthly.  My lease is up at the end of September.  I'm currently paying $3000 rent monthly, so accounting rent, that would add another 2-3 months on my timeline for credit card bills.  I plan on moving somewhere cheaper and pay around $1500 or so.

So accounting for food/rent and NOTHING else, it'll take me about 9 months to clear out my credit card debt alone.  And including interest, probably 11 months.  Is there any way to lessen this crazy interest?

All the while I'm making minimum payments on student loans and the IRS, which comes out to be around $450/month, which pushes the timeline for credit card bills to around 13 months.

To polish off the rest of my IRS debt/Student Loans, assuming I make the same amount of money next year, it'd take me another 14 months.

Low rate  are available at both variable as well as fixed rate. There are many types of  marine loans Australia lenders in the market today. The commercial lenders can offer better rates than the banks. Hence, more boat purchasers prefer to take a loan from these smaller commercial boat finance Australia lenders than from banks. 

The types of boat loans available are:
* Fixed Rate finance- For fixed rate loan, you need to pay a fixed sum of money monthly. It will help you to manage your budget, as well. Conversely, for variable rate loan or adjustable rate loan the interest rate fluctuates with a change in market interest rate.

Three simple steps to take boat finance
1)	Should be to verify that your credit reports are accurate to ensure you qualify for ship loans with the best rates and terms. Upon receipt of your loan application the lender checks your credit file.
2)	should be to locate companies that specialize in ship loans. Speak to a few companies that specialize in boat loans and tell them what you are looking for. Ask each boat loan broker to outline all of your loan expenses so that you can later compare all of your options.
3)	to determine the value of the boat you are about to purchase. This is vital when obtaining ship loans and a good boat advance broker will prove invaluable to you in determining the true current value of the boat you are looking to purchase and finance.

personalfinance,"Low income now, high income later. Should I convert my TSP balance to a Roth?","Greetings, personal finance gurus!

After working for a few years in the federal government, I came back to grad school. I put money into my (traditional) TSP account while I was working. Since I am in grad school right now, my tax rate is very low, so I am wondering if I should convert some of my TSP balance to my Roth IRA now. I have to pay taxes on that money eventually, and now seems like the best time.

Details:
I am 29 years old. I have $33k in my TSP and $52k in a Roth IRA at Vanguard. I project my 2014 income to be $23,700 and my 2015 income to be $26,070. I will graduate in 2016, after which I expect to be in the 28% federal income tax bracket. In retirement, I would expect to be in the 25% bracket (obviously assuming tax rates and brackets do not change in the next 36 years).

Based on these numbers, I figure I want to take advantage of the chance to pay 15% tax on my earlier wages and investment returns. Since the 15% tax bracket applies to the first $36,900 in taxable income (i.e. the first $46,900 in AGI), I think I would want to withdraw ($46,900 - $23,700) = $23,200 from the TSP in 2014 and convert it to a Roth IRA, and then perform a similar exercise in 2015. (I might be mixing 2014 brackets with 2013 standard deduction and personal exemption, but I hope you get the idea.)

I have three questions:

1. What are your thoughts on this idea? Is there something I am overlooking? I am assuming the tax advantages outweigh the somewhat higher (but still good) expense ratios at Vanguard vs. TSP.

2. Mechanically, how does this work? I call Vanguard, have them collect the money and open a traditional IRA, then I move the money into my Roth, incurring the tax punishment?

3. Do the taxes have to be taken out of the money I convert, or can I pay the taxes using other (not tax-advantaged) funds? I would of course much prefer the latter. (Assume I can make the tax payment without endangering my emergency fund.)

* Overdraft on old student account: -£994, monthly interest and fees £21

I am graduating with a BS and no debts/loans from undergraduate (a clean slate so-to-speak). 

My medical school costs about $20k per year, so total cost would be about $80k for the four years and then cost of living would have to be added to that.

My parents have very good credit, could their Co-signing help me get a better rate?

personalfinance,Paying high-interest loan off with 0%APR credit card?,"I have a loan with GE Capital. The balance is ~$2,400 and the APR is 29.99%. I have a credit card with a 0% interest rate until May of 2015, with a $3,000 limit and no balance. I had planned to pay off the GE Capital loan with the credit card, but GE Capital will only allow me to use my bank account and routing number to submit online payment. They will not accept any type of credit card information. Can I possibly call them and submit payment with this credit card or is this not possible? I can't see any reason why using a credit card would not be acceptable, since they are getting their payment either way.",finance,1406443001
personalfinance,I need help getting everything together.,"So basically, I'm 22, and decided college wasn't for me. I dropped out and got a job at Walmart. Make $7.65 an hour with 24-32 hours a week. After getting a poor evaluation (different story, alcoholic manager), I've had enough of Walmart and found another job that pays 10.43/hr with 40-60 hours a week, with bonuses and raises every quarter. 

I'm not sure how to manage this change in finances. I know it's not much, but it's new to me. Now the important info, as I stated before, I was in college, and now I'm paying back student loans. I don't really understand them, so I just pay what I'm told. I have 4 loans. 

* Direct Stafford Sub for $1750 with a fixed rate of 3.4%
* Direct Stafford Sub for $3500 with a fixed rate of 3.4%
* Direct Stafford Unsub for $1000 with a fixed rate of 6.8%
* Direct Stafford Unsub for $2000 with a fixed rate of 6.8%

I pay a total of $51 a month for all 4. 

Other bills: I live at home and pay $275 to my parents, I pay $75 a month for my phone, and $51 a month in car insurance.

So, how do make the most out of the new job? I also need to set up an emergency fund as well. The new job also has a 401-k plan that matches 100% of the first 4% of my contributions. How do I make the most out of that? I'll answer any questions I can.

23K at 6.41%
9K at 6.8%
14K at 6.8%

Bitcoin,"I want to know your thoughts on the future value of Bitcoin, please?","I'm sorry for sounding like such a noob, but it's probably because I am. I'm just a 19 year old kid that got involved in bitcoin when I was 16, and I started buying, trading, and mining bitcoin... I made a decent amount of money doing that, until the market got as dense at is currently is, and exponentially expanding. 

I really just wanted to know your thoughts on the value of bitcoin in maybe a year or two.. I know that the government has a lot of bubbles going all the time, and that we're in a huge deficit while inflation continues to exponentially rise. The Federal Reserve is going to pop very soon, there's no question about it, but at that time, what will the bitcoin value be?

So many experts on several different forums are saying that that would be around $10,000 a piece. It sounds quite ridiculous, but at the same time, the U.S. dollar inflation is quite ridiculous. 

Mining bitcoin is quite worthless at this point, but I'm working on a web application with a few old high school friends, and some new college friends. We're building a website which functions as a social network like Facebook or Twitter. The only difference, is that it has no government surveillance without a warrant (the way it should be), or any targeted ads. 

These are the 2 main issues of any social network at the moment. We were trying to come up with a way to monetize our website/app, and we found a way that is a lot more efficient than Facebook or Twitter's. We would write a script that mines bitcoin, and for every user using it, we would be mining bitcoin from their unused computing power, and pretty much recycling their wasted CPU power and, indirectly the electricity they're already paying for. 

Would this massive spike in bitcoin value make my website worth a ridiculous amount? 

It's www.sphinxed.com. We have the core features of the social network coded, however, we're waiting on having the script done. I coded all the PHP and SQL tables. Now I'm just researching with my friends on how to write a network mining script.

personalfinance,"Drive a lot for work, car problems, need advice on repairing vs new-to-me.","Hi all,
Newer subscriber here, absorbing all the knowledge I can. We've recently started using YNAB, just this month actually, and we've gotten a lot better about being accountable for where our money is going. My wife is an RN and I'm a field service tech for a POS computer company, we take home minimum $4500/mo, more depending on OT and mileage. We've been rebuilding credit and repaying debt like crazy, I paid $1750 off in June alone, and another $600 in July, with another $800 budgeted to finish off some credit cards in August. The remaining CC debt with interest rates between 15-29% will be transferred to a 4% interest card our new credit union is offering us. They've also approved us for a $15k car loan at 4.5%.

We have two cars, a 2008 Prius with 75k (owe $5k) that my wife drives, because she doesn't feel the Sentra is safe enough to protect the kids in an accident(and as a result, I rarely have the kids in my car), and I drive a 2005 Nissan Sentra with 122k miles on it, owned free and clear, new tires this spring and well maintained, I'm told. The sentra was my wife's first car, from age 16-24, and has some significant signs of wear, dents, scratches, and horrible paint degradation aside, you can't change which air vents the air comes out of(so no front defrost or anything but the main vents). I drive a lot for work, from 100-500 miles a week, getting reimbursed $0.55/mi. 

One day, the Sentra just stopped running at a red light and wouldn't come back to life for a couple of minutes, though the check engine light came on with it. I shopped around and the cheapest price I could find to fix the engine problem. The driver rear power window was also having a problem, it would go down but not up and was slowly sliding off the track. I ghetto fixed it with a badass duct tape patch that lasted for three months, but since I keep $10k+ in computers for work in my car, my boss required me to get it fixed. All said in done, cheapest I could find for both repairs was $375. My wife and I discussed it and decided if the Sentra would last even four months after the repair, it would be worth it over buying a new car and making payments.

Since I've gotten the car back, it's occasionally refused to start. I called the mechanic from the previous repair, who said it was most likely a bad battery, he had noticed some corrosion on the battery and cleaned the terminals for me but it may need a new battery. He offered to take a look at it, but something struck me as odd, he couldn't have cleaned the terminals without disconnecting the battery, right? And that would mean that my radio presets would be lost, which they weren't... I don't know, I didn't want to take it back to him, so I went to Autozone and they tested my battery and power system and said that my alternator was working correctly and the battery tested okay.

Basically, my job relies on me providing my own vehicle, and I need it to be reliable. Does it make sense to trade in the Sentra, take out a small loan (we were approved for $15k at 4.5% over 5 years, which we can afford), and purchase a low mileage, used car? I have been very happy with the Prius so far, and my logic on it is as follows... I have averaged 350 miles a week for work, so $190~, of which the Sentra takes $65 just in gas, but if I drove a vehicle with 40mpg average (and our Prius has averaged 42mpg reliably), I would only spend $32 on fuel to travel the same distance. That means more money in my pocket, around $125 a month, that I could use to pay part of the car payment itself, which would be around $300/mo. The original plan was to save up and buy a new car cash, but with the car problems and starting issues, I'm just not sure where we should draw the line.

So, any thoughts or advice on what is the wisest decision? A newer car would provide peace of mind for my employment and be safe enough to allow either vehicle to be used for transporting the kids. I don't know if you can tell from the tone of my post, but I'm clearly leaning toward a new car at this point, but I know it's probably not the most fiscally responsible decision... And with two kids, it's time I be fiscally responsible.


My wife wants an SUV, but I've convinced her that it doesn't make sense to get a vehicle with horrible MPG for space we'd only need 5% of the time. If we get a new car, it would be a Prius or another 40MPG+ vehicle, maybe a VW TDI, and when her Prius is paid off we would save up cash to buy a SUV or minivan or truck for towing/large purchases/whatever else she wants a big SUV for.",finance,1406471652

personalfinance,What should I do within interest free loan to maximize its impact?,"Hello PF.

My wife and I have been offered an interest free loan of $50k by my generous in laws. This is intended to help with our acquisition of a home, after selling the home we currently inhabit. However, we have been thinking and there may be more interesting or advantageous uses for the money. Here are the ideas we have come up with so far, and we would love to hear your thoughts on these as well as any ideas you may have. We are not poorly off, but We want to maximize the advantage that such an opportunity gives me.

We are currently in a 1100 sq ft, 2 bedroom condo that has proved challenging to sell, having been on the market for 60 days. We have equity in it, but will net less than the original downpayment at the current asking price. It was purchased for $134900 in 2005, it sits on the market at $114900 and is in a reasonably desirable area, but we have received no offers. We also have a mortgage on the condo, remaining value is $55k, with a bill of about $450 a month and interest rate of 5.35%. We considered renting the condo out but cannot afford two mortgages if it doesn't work and are not of the means to pay cash for a new home.

 I have a car loan, $320/mo, for a few more years. Payoff cost is $13k and the interest rate is 2.4%. Present net value if I sold it would be about 6k which is not really enough to replace it with a worthwhile car, as my commute is about 35 miles one way. Moving closer to work and reducing this was the original motivator for selling this condo. I am disinterested in selling the car also because I really like it.

My student loan lasts 7 more years, is $140/month at 6.7% interest, and payoff is $10k basically. I would pay it off but I'm holding liquid cash right now to help with closing costs, furnishing the new place, and rainy days. 

In all options the loan begins repayment immediately at about $140/mo for 30 years. 

Option one, pay off my car and student loan, hold the rest liquid. This frees up $320/month, leaves about $26k in my rainy day closing cost fund.

Option 2, raid the rainy day fund and pool it with the loan to pay off the condo. Same net result as above, as the payments are close to being the same. Except no immediate increase in liquid holdings. 

Option 3, I hope you will suggest an option 3!",finance,1406478077
worldpolitics,"The Claim That Hamas Kidnapped The Three Israeli Teens Is the ""Iraq WMD"" Of Gaza. The nett effects of Israel's atrocities in Gaza will be more more war, terrorism, misery and poverty","See http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-claim-that-hamas-kidnaped-three.html for graphics and video 

Israeli officials have now admitted that Hamas did not kidnap and murder the three Israeli teens.

Truth is famously the first casualty of war, and the Israeli war on Gaza is no exception. On Friday July 26th Jon Donnison of the BBC pulled the rug out from under the Israeli government’s pretext for the Gaza onslaught with a series of tweets about a conversation he’d had with Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld about the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June.
The boys were not killed by Hamas, Rosenfeld told Donnison
The three teens were abducted on June 12. That same day Israeli authorities received a desperate phone call from one of the boys that contained gunfire at its conclusion. The supposition that the boys were dead was advanced when Israeli authorities found the car in which the abduction had taken place, with evidence they’d been shot.
The information about the gunshots on that desperate last phone call was widely known in the media, but as we reported, the Israeli government issued a gag order against these facts being published. And over the last two-and-a-half weeks of June, the Israelis launched extensive raids across the West Bank, locking down Hebron, supposedly to find the boys. But the major focus of the raids was rooting out Hamas affiliates and arresting them. In fact, the purpose of the raids seemed to be to break up the recent unity government between Hamas and Fatah, which Israel has vigorously opposed.

The boys’ bodies were found on June 30, in a shallow grave in the West Bank; and again the deaths were exploited to punish Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said then, “Hamas is responsible… Hamas will pay.”

 http://mondoweiss.net/2014/07/killed-turning-onslaught.html

This is Israel: Our 3 boys weren't kidnapped by Hamas after all - we just needed an excuse to start bombing Gaza.
http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/hamas-didnt-kidnap-the-israeli-teens-after-all.html

It was obvious to anyone who used any common sense and was not blinded by hate (very soon after the news hit that the three teens had been kidnapped) that Hamas was not responsible for the kidnapping. 

It was also obvious that the Israeli government was using this incident as a false pretext to dramatically up the level of hate and violence in Israel and Gaza and was a probable prelude to Israel invading Gaza.

It is also obvious to anyone using any common sense, that an Israeli invasion of Gaza would have the following effects:- 

It would murder several hundred innocent civilians in Gaza, including women and children.

It would increase the level of hate between Jews, Christians and Muslims, in Israel, in the US, in the Middle East, in Europs and the Rest of the World.

It would increase the number of Islamic Extremist terrorists in the world. 
Israel has killed about 200 Hamas fighters in Gaza, it has recruited thousands more Jihadists.

It will increase the risk of Islamic terrorist attacks in Israel, in the US or US interests and in Europe. 
Everybody in those countries is now LESS safe as a result of Israel's actions based on nothing but lies.

It will increase global tensions, which will increase military spending in Israel, in the US, in Europe, in the Middle East and in the world in general.

It will increase the level of conflict in the Middle East. 

It will make the price of oil higher than it would otherwise be, due the lack of supply and investment if future production that this increased level of conflict will bring.

It will make everyone in Israel, the US, Europe, Asia and the rest of the world poorer. 
Except for the owners and CEO's of companies that make money out of war - arms companies and big banks.   
Except for the owners and CEO's of big oil companies and those who control large oil reserves such as the House of Saud.

This it has undoubtedly done and will undoubtedly do.

The ignorant, indoctrinated and brain washed idiots in America, who have lost even the capability to rationally think and are blinded by hate, are saying ""Stand With Israel"". 

What they are actually saying is I want to be poorer and be at greater risk of being blown up by a terrorist bomb. 
What they are saying is I want more American troops to needlessly die, fighting more counter productive wars, wasting trillions more dollars, based on nothing but lies. 
What they are saying is I want to impoverish and destroy my own country, so that a few very wealthy men can get richer.
What they are saying is I want American hegemony to end sooner and China and Russia to take over.

For that is surely the result of America's continuing support for Israel and it's undoubted war crimes and atrocities in Gaza. 
War crimes of deliberately targeting civilians to maximise casualties and the level of hate around the world. 

America will alienate many more countries and people with it's policy of unwavering support and lack of condemnation of the war criminal policies of the Israeli government. 
America will undoubtedly be economically poorer as a result, with higher unemployment and lower wages due to a lack of demand for workers. 

The American public is already the ONLY country in the world that still supports Israel.

Americans have been blinded by hate, religious bigotry (rapturists &amp; extreme evangelicals) and have been fed a barrage of lies for decades, costing many billions of dollars by AIPAC, other Israeli lobbying groups and the US mainstream media. 
And the lies told by American politicians being bribed with hundreds of millions of dollars a years from Israel or that are making millions of dollars for themselves out of more war.
All of this false propaganda and lies is paid for by American taxpayers out of the billions in ""foreign aid"" given to Israel each year. 
Americans pay with their trillions of tax dollars and the blood of their children in more pointless wars. 
American taxpayers pay for the lies told in Europe too. In the lies told by Europe's media and by bribing European politicians. 

There is one ray of hope.
American support for Israel mainly comes from the over 50's and their influence will wane over time. 
Americans under the age of 30 are rightly against the policies of Israel and their influence will increase over time. 

A massive majority of Americans under 30 say that Israel's recent actions in Gaza are unjustified (51% to 25%) in a Gallup poll of July 15th. 
http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.607224 
http://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/5934837/gallup-israel-gaza-americans 

This opinion against Israel can only have increased with Israel's subsequent mass slaughter of innocent civilians over the last 2 weeks. 

The latest casualty count (as at July 26th) is:-
1,040 Gazans killed with over 5,000 wounded.
Of the dead around 200 were Hamas fighters, the other 800+ were innocent civilians including around 200 children. 
3 Israeli civilians have been murdered since the bombardment of Gaza started. The rest of the Israeli casualties are IDF troops.

People under 30 do not get their information from the continuously lying Corporate owned and controlled media (unlike most of the over 50's). 
People under 30 mostly get their information from the internet which has lots on the reality of Israel and recent events in Gaza. They also haven't been brainwashed and indoctrinated so much by being subjected to decades of lying Hasbara and Neocon propaganda in the Western media.

America was the only country to vote against ensuring human rights were protected in Israel and voted against setting up a war crimes investigation of recent actions in Gaza by the UN. 



Millions and millions more people around the world are now waking up to these lies with the latest Israeli atrocities being broadcast widely on social media (even if the mainstream media is still feeding a barrage of lies). 

There have never been so many protests against Israel in so many countries. 
There have never been so many Jews protesting against the atrocities of Israel. 

Pictures of some of the protests against Israel held around the world on July 26th.

The crimes of Israel are supported and encouraged by those who make money out of the nett effect of Israel's crimes - those who make money out of more war and conflict. 
The owners and CEO's of arms companies, big banks and oil companies. 

Things in Israel and the Middle East will only change for the better when the financial cost to Israel exceeds the benefits. 

Pressure needs to be applied by ordinary people to stop the billions of military aid given to Israel each year by the US government. 
Pressure also needs to be applied in other countries, particularly in Europe, to stop their governments arming Israel. The UK is the worst offender, mainly because so most of the British MP's have been bribed by Israel (all three main parties).

Pressure needs to be applied to governments around the world to cease trade with, and apply sanctions to, Israel for it's Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, genocide and other war crimes. 
Like Chile and the Maldives have just done.

I think my interest rate is 4.25%, perhaps 4.125%, can't remember which.

I am a freelance writer. I was making around $1400 a month (just starting out) but I'm in between assignments at the moment. I'm looking to get more to earn around $3000 a month. I am saving up to move to a new city (timeline open, hoping for 3 months but we'll see) and go to an event abroad in mid-Feb that I must go to even before thoughts of moving (~$1500-$2000). I have 2 savings and 2 checking accounts, and my Paypal business account that I get paid with. I virtually have no savings. 

I have some debt. Medical bills around $100. Credit card debt is around $1000. $500 of that is starting to gain interest now at around 22%. The other $500 will gain the same interest starting in October. I have an outstanding bill in credit collections for $231, and a loan I defaulted on accidentally that is around $2681 now. Not sure what to do about that one. 

My monthly bills consist of $200 medical expenses, $50 min. credit payments, then food, gas, and entertainment. 

I see that I need to raise my income, build an emergency savings, and savings for moving and my trip abroad. How do I do this? That's a lot of savings accounts. I already have one in use specifically for paying my federal taxes. Any hints on how to approach any of this? I am really eager to move...

I am debating on pulling the $1800 straight out and putting it on my highest interest rate credit card.  Is this idea any good?  How much should I expect to see when I actually get the check minus taxes and the 10% early cash out?

My second question.  How do I go about getting my former company to fork it over in whatever way I end up doing?  It isnt the best of relationships but the admin for the 401k plan is the owner.  Is there a form or letter I can just fax them to not have to go there or call them directly?

For most of my 20s I was irresponsible with financial decisions and continue to pay for those mistakes now.  My situation is this: I am roughly $45K in debt.  

The debt is spread out over personal loans (Lending Club) and Credit Cards.  The blended interest rate on all debt is ~26%.  Monthly payments on all debt total ~$1,600.  

These high interest rates are really hurting my chance to absolve myself of this problem.  I’ll make a little over $100K this year.  My middle credit score is a 648.  My credit is hurt by the maxed credit cards. I have ~$60K in a 401K.   

I would love to consolidate all debt into a 5 year note ideally around 8% - that would make my payment $912, which would be much more manageable.

Should we approach differently than if we were 21?","My partner and I owe slightly over $280,000 dollars in federal student loans (at an average of 6.4% interest).  My brain is telling me to pay it off as quickly as possible, with all extra income over necessities going towards loans.  The gut is telling me that it might be nice to start saving more for retirement, buy a house, etc.

If I was 21 and just finished college, I would have no problem being frugal and hitting these loans hard.  Now, after 12 years of being frugal during college/grad school/etc, I feel like maybe I deserve a little, even if it costs me more in interest.  My current thought might be to just invest/save $2,000/month (max IRA, then mutual fund) and then put the rest towards loans.  We really only have about 6 months of living expenses in savings.  What do you all think?

Monthly Net Take-Home: $10,750

Loan Payment (minimum): $3,100

Current Living Expenses: $3,500/month.  Includes rent, insurance, utilities, food, sundries, transportation, etc.

Savings: $35,000.  Standard savings.  

Investments: $8,000.  Mainly inherited stock.

Rental Property: +$250/month, owe $115K, worth $110-$120K.

I've been working for roughly a year (I'm 23 years old) and wanted a bit of a sanity check on my budgeting as I just switched jobs and moved to California. 

Including stock grants, I'm making about $185k/year. Last year when I was still eligible I contributed the maximum I could to my Roth IRA, and now I'm going to max out my 401k with 50% employer contribution.

My rent is about $2k/month, and I expect to spend an additional $1.5-2k per month, which amounts to about $50k-ish expenses per year. I've calculated my effective tax rate (Federal and State) to be about 35%. I think this means that I can save about $50k or $60k per year. I'm investing my unspent earnings in a low cost ETF that tracks the US stock market, as well as a bit (less than 10%) in another EFT that tracks international markets.

*  11k in index fund. Can sell at any time, very liquid.
*  35,821 in student loan debt @ 6.275% interest.
*  11,503 in a second student loan @ 7.25%
*  4462 in credit card debt @ 22.9%

I also have:

*  10k in a 401k
*  1k in a RothIRA

I make:

*  60k/yr base
*  ~10k/yr in bonuses
*  Am 24 years old.

My monthly expenses come out to ~1729.17. I make 2951.4 a month.

If nothing changes with my current situation I will also be getting 18k after taxes exactly 12 months from now. This is my current plan, but I am not sure if it is a good one:

End of this month I will be selling part of the index fund to pay off my credit card completely and then literally freezing that thing so I don't get stupid with it again. I will also be getting 2.5k extra cash in August that I will put back into the index fund to partially make up for what I took out for the credit card. 

I will have 9.5k left in the index fund. 

When I get the extra 18k in a year I am going to take my money out of my RothIRA (should be up to about 3-4k by then) as a first time home, buyer and put down 20% on  a small house. (I live in a very cheap place, 100k will buy a nice house. Definitely nice enough for me and my girlfriend.) This lets me avoid PMI.

I was originally thinking about putting it on a 5 or 10 year note and paying it off very quickly, but thinking about it more I have thought about doing this:

Putting ~80k home loan on a 30 yr mortgage (If I can find a bank that will lend that little for that long).

Make payments of ~350/mo on the house.

Use my extra income that was previously going to rent to pay on my student loans (Putting it at around 800 a month).

Once my student loan is payed off, refinance on a shorter note and finishing paying off house.

I figure a home loan interest rate will be smaller than my student loan interests rates.

**One big caveat**, and the reason I am not taking my 18k + 11k to pay off my student loan debt, is my parents are also making payments on my student loan debt. So right now my student loan debt is getting double payments (~600/mo).

Aside from the tiny bit of guilt I feel at having them make a monthly payment as well, I don't know if that changes things enough that I should just make the 300 dollar a month payment on the student loan and just finance the house on a short note from the start.

Or maybe I should do something different completely.

A few notes:

*  I am contributing to my 401k up to the % that my employer matches (12%).
*  I plan to start maxing out my RothIRA in November. I was for a bit but then stopped. Decided I need to start again though.


Not sure what other information is relevant. My job is stable, and even if this company goes under (**HUGE** if), my skill set is very portable to other industries and companies within that industry.

Thoughts? Questions? I think I included all relevant information. I've stopped adding stuff to my CC. That was a blunder about a year ago when I did something (financially) stupid right before a minor emergency.

*  Rent
*  Food

*  Phone
*  Internet
*  Electric
*  Student loan
*  Car insurance
*  Gym

The other ~1.2k I have left over is spent on dumb bullshit. It probably shouldn't be, and I can cut back when needed.

9. I again check the blockchain and see the money go from RJ to MM then from MM to 1DD. From 1DD there is never a payout of anything close to 123 btc.  So, I simply ask MM for a transaction id.

10. MM emails me copies of emails of him ""taking care"" of customers and says, ""now do I look like a scammer? I have no need for his 125 btc, I have over 50,000 bitcoins""

11. This seems crazy, I email Michael and again ask, ""MM, this is simple, I need the payout trx id so I can get RJ off my back. Where are his coins?"" I tell him the RJ will go to the feds soon, he really should give me the info.

12. MM then says that if RJ goes to the Feds that RJ will be arrested because the coins are dirty and stolen. Then asks me, ""Why would you send someone 125 btc and need them cleaned in 24 hours? Why so quickly? Because they are stolen or hacked that's why""

13. I email MM and tell him he is wrong. I say that RJ is clean and so are the coins. At this point I'm shocked! How can MM play cop? He runs a launder site and chooses when to send coins back to the customer?

14. MM emails back and asks to see the proof that RJ and his coins are clean... which I provide him. MM writes back and says that he has checked into RJ and I am right, that RJ and his coins are clean and so he will get them back shortly. Wants RJ to email him with btc address and an agreement that once the 125 btc is returned, that the case is done.

15. RJ emails MM as requested and MM confirms and says he will send a test transaction for 0.01 btc and then the rest. MM sends 0.01 and then shows his true colors by KEEPING THE REST!  He has never sent the rest of the stolen btc.

again, for copies of all emails, see http://antilyze.com

The day after he was supposed to send the 125 btc and did not, MM posts in the forum that he has opened hotbitcoins.com and has decided to ""Give Away Free Bitcoin"" but fails to respond to any email from JC or RJ about the stolen coins.

Then yesterday, he responds to a thread concerning the safety of investing in btc and claims, ""I have invested $400,000 in bitcoin, proof: 1DD.

Like an idiot, he shows the address that he has already told me is the bitlaunder payout address. So, when users send him coin, and he mixes them and then either does or does not (in the case of RJ) return them to the customer, he is claiming that as proof of his btc investments.

Laughable clown! Those are users of your site depositing coin that you are to pay them out with... that isn't investing you fraud scumbag.

Now, MM since when this all began has continued operating all his scam sites including but not limited to:

bitwebhosting.com   
elaunder.com, 
bitbuzzer.com, 
btwager.com, 
btcstakes.com,

bitscams.org   
bitmeetup.com, 
bitsweeps.com, 
bitbing.com

Here is his reason, so far, for not paying back RJ. In the course of my trying to get him to admit that he had RJ coins, I sent an email from another account (same IP) in which I even signed the email JC. He was supposed to know it was me, but I was trying to get him to admit that he had the coins. In my email I said, ""I know what you've done, so to keep me quiet, I need 20 btc"" 

I admit now, that wasn't the best idea but I was always in contact with RJ and had MM decided to send the 20 btc, I would have sent it to RJ immediately and with it, the obvious fact that MM has admitted to stealing the coins. Nope, instead MM makes a site named after my name http://jerancampanella.com and claims there that I am a scammer extortionist. Claims I was fired from my job at CCN for writing lies about MM, claims that my house is in foreclosure and that I am scamming bitcoin businesses.

This must stop. I am trying to recover funds for RJ. I wanted nothing out of this. But at this point, I want MM to pay Ricky back or pay by going to jail for running a scam operation.

In the interview he slammed Coinbase and Circle for their practices and wanting to know your private info. On his sites he claims the following:

Customer service is available 24/7 by our support ticket system and we usually respond within hours. Feel free to contact us with questions, concerns, feedback or suggestions for new features. (He did not get back to RJ for days)

If you make money speculating, you may incur 'capital gains taxes' in your country. However, we DO NOT report to any revenue agency or government, nor would we comply with official requests for information. Whether you choose to pay taxes on your profits is your business. (Illegal)

We will NOT comply with any court order for information pertaining to our clients, nor will we comply with any government request (of any country) for information about our clients. (see paragraph above)

Moral here is that MM is a scumbag. He has tried to scare me into backing down with repeated threats of what will happen if I don't get back to my life. He has also offered me bribes for ignoring RJ and getting back to my life. I will DO NO SUCH THING since they all involve letting him steal $80,000. He has made a recent post on the forum and at jerancampanella.com saying some of his sites have been reported by me and that my claims are ""factless."" Again, please see http://antilyze where every bit of proof is found.  Also see RJ's most recent post here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=713699.0

It is true that I have been and will continue reporting every single site you own. I have already had all your sites listed on badbitcoin.org.  Why can't you stop being a douchebag and return the $80,000 you flat out stole from RJ?

Here is why:  
You are not a Doctor in any way. You are a school boy thief who lives with Mommy
You are not Michael Moriarty, and you are not a criminal mastermind like the Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes. He is a character, cause in real life... scam artists like you and Karpeles pay for your actions.
You are not a PhD from Stanford.  You might have a PhD in being a scammy piece of shit however.
You register all your sites under a pseudonym. 
You register them under a ""mailing center"" or fake addresses You list fake phone numbers that do not work. 

You are attempting to operate a business with a refusal to remain transparent because of the fact that on occasion you see a need to steal your customers money. If you operated your business like the businesses you hate, Coinbase, Circle, etc. you would not be able to steal, because these companies are owned and operated by legit businesses who follow laws which help protect it's customers, and include accountability. You have none of these things.  What you do have is nothing more than a movie poster as your identity and of the owner of your company. This allows your customers no redress in the event, such as RJ, of theft of their money when entrusting it to one of your many sites.

I OFFICIALLY AM OFFERING ALL I CAN TO HELP CATCH THIS SCAMMY SCHOOL BOY.  THE BOUNTY WILL BE PAID FOR INFO HELPING TO BRING MM TO JUSTICE OR TO PAY WHAT HE HAS STOLEN.  My Bounty on MM is 1 btc.

I'm available for chat at http://antilyze.com  I am not hard to find. I'm not hiding. I'm not the piece of shit and if after reading this you think MM is anything but a piece of shit, then I suggest you look in the mirror and btw, you stink.

Would appreciate comments or any help or ideas on how we get this no good scammer running a scam operation that has probably turned thousands off bitcoin with his theft.  See below more sites that talk about this loser MM.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

The good thing about the 25 year plan is that after 25 years my debt is forgiven, but my fear is that I might end up paying more due to my interest accruing.  Also I work for public service so after 10 years my debt can be forgiven.    Any input is welcome.

personalfinance,Need Advice on Mortgage Situation,"Hey PF,

10 years ago my husband and I bought a home using no money down, interest only loan. The 1st mortgage was 165K and the 2nd was 40K. Next month our 10 year interest only period (on a 30 year loan) is up and we will start paying principal. We currently pay $682 per month (includes taxes &amp; insurance) for the 1st and $285 for the 2nd. 1st mortgage is around 4% with balance of $165, and 2nd is at 1.9% balance $22K. We pay $3600 a year in taxes.

Our 2nd mortgage will be paid off in 6 years. In we do nothing our mortgage will increase $500 per month. We called our lender to confirm. This is going to be a huge hit to our monthly budget...we could absorb the increase BUT it will hurt. My husband just took a different position that has lowered our monthly income and increased our expenses. It was a needed move as he was a mechanic and now he is in Management. Short term the financial impact is difficult long term it was the only choice as his body is breaking down from being a mechanic for over 15 years.

Also for full disclosure we filed BK 3.5 years ago and we never re-affirmed our mortgage however we kept paying and never had a late/missed payment on either the 1st or 2nd. Legally we are no longer responsible for the debt. However I do not think it's really doable to walk away either. We have 2 teenage boys and 2 dogs. We do not want to leave our school district which was the whole reason for moving to this area.

We do not have money for a downpayment for a new house and realistically in our area I don't think we could do better or cheaper house and taxes wise. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to roll the 2nd into a new loan since we are paying such a low rate and it will be gone in 6 years. We are upside down since our home value is only about $130. Our 1st is a ARM so I fully expect the rates to only increase. The ARM for the 1st is the LIBOR 6 month index. Interest rates will never be increased by more than 2 percentage points on any single change date from the interest rate I've been paying in the preceeding 6 months. My interest rate will never be greater than 11.375%.

So I belive my options are fairly limited. It would suck to rfinance since we would have to reamoritize and pay so much addition interest. I think we will only be able to refinance under HARP??? Not even sure about that. This is a Fannie Mae loan.

My husband wants to try and get another interest only for just the 1st until our 2nd is paid off and the thought is we would refi to a 15year. I'm scared to leave it as an ARM because I am nervous about the interest rates going up. 

Anyway sorry for the long winded post. Hoping to get some good ideas on what to do.",finance,1406565723
personalfinance,Recently Married - Should I Pay Down Student Loans or Retain My Investments?,"So here's my situation - I just got married a month ago and my wife just graduated from her medical program. Her student loan grace periods are about to end, and I always assumed I would use the investments I've accumulated over the last couple years to pay down her debt. The biggest loan is 25k at 6.8% (pretty rough interest rate, I'll admit) and there are some smaller ones that round out the total at about 42k (I would pay off the 6.8% one first). 

We are not interested in buying a house or making any other large moves that would involve needing a good credit score - mine is good right now at about 780, but I'm worried that having these huge loans may cause it to dip. 

For the past few months, I've just assumed that when the grace periods end, and when I've retained my stocks and ETFs for over a year, I'd just sell them so I only have to pay long term capital gains tax. After doing a little analysis, however, I am considering holding the investments because of their performance. Most of them are in emerging markets dividends and domestic growth ETFs so the bull market has done them well - I estimate that they are earning about 20% annualized returns currently, so I'm definitely hesitant to sell them. I'm also aware that they're on the riskier side and can certainly drop quickly (I'm investing in growth mostly because I'm pretty young still and can hold them for the long run if they take a big hit). 

The market's been great lately, and obviously I can't expect it to continue forever. I estimate that I need to make 8% on the investments before taxes on a yearly basis to justify keeping them over paying off the loans. Should I hang on to them and just try to pay double (or triple) principal on the loans for awhile (thus meaning no or minimal investments for the next couple years) or should I sell them and pay off the loans in one fell swoop?",finance,1406566749

personalfinance,Question about a down payment on a house and student loans,"Hey I'm sorta stuck on what the best move might be for me right now and wanted to see if any of you had any ideas.

I'm 30 and looking to buy my first home.  I have about $52,000 left on my student loans (two of them 1 for 20k and one for 32k).  I make around 120k a year and have 40k in the bank. My credit score is in the excellent range. I was looking at houses in between the 250-300k range.

The problem is that I don't know how I should be spending my money first.  I could pay off 1 of the student loans (the 20k as the interest rate is too high 6.5%) but that might only leave me about 30k for a down payment after saving a bit.  I like this because it get's my monthly payments down and frees up some credit but I'll have less for a downpayment on a house (say 10% down instead of 20%) 

So what's better?  Free up some credit and lower my monthly payments or save up for a bigger down payment on a house?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks",finance,1406569903
personalfinance,I'm 18 and I know I'll eventually need a credit score - should I get a credit card now?,"I have only ever had a debit card and a savings account. My parents have always taught me that borrowing money is a thing you do as scarcely as possible, and only for investment-type projects, like a house or an education. I am currently in no debt, but I since I am going to university this fall, I'm about to take out two small federal loans (about $1000 each) and one parent PLUS loan (about $11,000) for the year. This will be my only personal debt. 

I know that after a year of living on campus, I'll want to save money (and grow up a little) by getting my own apartment or sharing one with a couple friends. But renting a place requires a credit score, and even if I choose not to do this for whatever reason, I'll eventually need a credit score sometime in my life anyway. I don't want to get caught in a situation where I need emergency funds and can't get a loan because I have no credit score, or can't buy a house, or whatever. 

So I'm thinking of getting a retail credit card, specifically a Target RED card. I shop there regularly, so I could use it to buy the stuff I already buy, and just pay off each bill before it's due. This will gradually build me a good score, right?

But is it damaging to my score or financial integrity to have a credit card at 18 years old? Will banks, the government, whoever look at me later and go, ""Well, you screwed yourself over by getting a credit card so young,"" even if I paid my bills on time?

Bitcoin,"The stolen 600+ Bitcoin Lesson, Identity Theft, Nothing is 100% Safe, but you’ll Survive","I'll try and keep it short,

In 2011 I purchased 700 Bitcoins from a friend/coworker who “needed the money ASAP” I didn’t understand Bitcoin at the time but he told me it had potential so I agreed to help him out and bought as much as he needed in cash.
At the time Bitcoin was very inexpensive, and as we all know it exploded, I ended up selling 71 of them and paid off my student loan, bank loan, credit card and my car, plus got the girlfriend a ring, everything was good.
I didn’t want to sell them all because I didn’t want to have that kind of cash to play with and be irresponsible so I thought I’ll sell when I need money for my wedding/downpayment, Makes sense right?

On April 12th of this year my girlfriend and I left for a 5 week vacation (Proposal) 
When we got back on May 16th our apartment had been robbed.
Among the things stolen were two computer, iPad, cordless phone, modem, NES + games, external hard drives, coffee maker, two watches, jewellery, alcohol from overseas, and other random belongings including a stuffed whale from SeaWorld WTH, but the heartbreaker was my 130+ LB Safe, my safe contained a lot of government documents, paystubs, work documents, bank info and cards with safety deposit keys, a copy of my lease, insurance stuff, memory sticks with Bitcoin (Encrypted) you know stuff you put in a safe. they took the whole 130+ pound safe down an elevator and out of my place and life.

I did have backups inside a safety deposit box, but using my now stolen identity they got those too along with some very old coins I kept, given to me by my dad, and some other very important original documents, they also applied for credit and credit cards these guys literally took me for everything.

Now the high point of the story, one of the individuals was caught shortly after I arrived back home and reported the crimes, thanks to bank survillance, and some police work, he has been charged with fraud, possession of stolen property, a number of charges relating to identity theft and so on.
After keeping my stuff for over a month the police finally gave me back my iPad, and NES without all the games a minor victory, Yippy. What I found very annoying with this process is I had to “describe” my belonging. (Take pictures of everything you own people)
I never got back my myriad of documents, memory sticks computer, or any of the other stuff. and the police say that none of my other belonging were found in the persons house.

The police believe the group involved made multiple trips into my place knowing that I wouldn't be coming home, the person who was arrested is believed to be part of an organized crime ring (it’s not just a movie thing) and believe one of my neighbours (unknown) was involved. The police after making the arrest are now for the most part very unhelpful.
Since I am relatively new to the building I wouldn’t know who to suspect, but my fiancee tells me that there is lots of gossip going on with the neighbours.

My theory is that this individual is some patsy/idiot or low level person within the group, The bravery/stupidity it would take to enter a bank and pose as someone else complete with fake id’s etc makes me doubt he could have been the one who setup the whole thing, it would take an intelligent person to know you can’t enter a bank and not be caught on camera.
I believe he was paid with my iPad and NES and probably some cash to commit the crimes. The guy knows what will happen if he talks so he keeps quiet, the real masterminds are still out there. I do believe a neighbour was involved and I also have a strong feeling someone at the bank was in on it too, but I could just be paranoid.
Either way I switched banks, I’m trying to find a way break my lease without incurring a penalty I can’t afford now and I don’t talk to my neighbours anymore.

Morale of the story:
Aside from destroying my credit temporarily, stealing my identity, making it hard for me to wake up in the morning, destroying my trust in people, dealing with cops, ruining my life for a short while, driving me into a deep depression that’s convinced my doctor I can't work till November, and taking a shitload of Bitcoins from me that they can never access and probably don’t even know they have, I still feel surprising ok, ok enough to write to you all and let you know that nothing is completely safe, nothing is completely secure but if something does happen it’s won’t be the end of the world.
I’ve learned many important lessons, I’ve learned to make more then two backups because your bank can be robbed, your house can be robbed they can be robbed simultaneously, so do everything you can to prevent it from happening including but not limited to surgically implanting the memory stick under your skin in an arm.
But for me the most valuable lessons I've learned through this ordeal is I’m a very strong person, I’m still here, still ticking, I’ll still get married, I’ll still have kids, I’m still in love, I’ll still live old and I know, I hope I make it back along the way. and I did payoff my debts so that’s awesome.

personalfinance,Effect of age of student loan on credit history? Currently making payments.,"Hi PF,

I'm rebudgeting my personal finances for this upcoming school year (my student aid, income, etc all are affected starting September), and was wondering if anyone has any insight on the age of a student loan and its impact on my credit.

The breakdown is I have four subsidized loans below:
&gt;$3500 on 9/2011
&gt;$3000 on 9/2012
&gt;$450 on 6/2013
&gt;$245.92 7/2013

I am currently allocating 10% to 15% of my income monthly towards student loan payments, so I do not wind up with a huge cloud over my head when I graduate.  

My question: Since all my loans are at the same annual percentage interest rate when I get out, would it matter which loan I am paying at that moment?  I am currently just assuming it does not matter or has little effect since they are non-revolving credit, and so am paying the smaller loans first (hence the last one went from $450 to $245 in the past month).

Thanks in advance.  Also, if anyone has any input as to how to attack anything else related to student loans or budgeting, I would love to hear any input :D",finance,1406575410

It's so overwhelming and I am beyond tired of it being bad and desperately need to do something to turn it around now while I'm still in my late 20's. I think I'm doing good but I'm really not sure if I'm doing all I can.

Here's a brief rundown:

- Get a $500+- credit limit Capitol One card when I'm like 18 for a family trip, use some and let my parents use the rest, they take over paying and just don't. Fast forward several years later and I'm getting sued and wages garnished. So that's been *paid* but not in a good way.

- Amass a ton of student loan debt and have parents in charge of it all and they just don't pay and I try to take over and can't pay. Get calls once they're in collections from GCS for personal loans (is this place a scam?) and I can't even remember the name of the other right now but it shows up on my bank statement as SALLIE MAE FDR for the federal loans. I'm essentially paying to get back in the good graces of SLM and pay them directly instead of these collections places and supposedly it expunges the bad records from my credit report.

- I have two public records according to creditkarma.com and I remember one that was due to me moving to another state for a job and not realizing I needed to pay state tax at the previous state of residence.

personalfinance,Income Tax Issues,"Okay, you guys. I just have a few questions that the people in payroll can not answer for me, and I don't really know how to start.

To start, I have lived in Alabama my whole life, and I have been going to UA for a year now. This past spring, I was offered a paid internship at a manufacturing company in TN for the Summer. I get paid $xxx an hour, and have free housing provided by the company (not deducted from my pay, I make as much as the in-state interns).

When I was filling out tax forms at the beginning, I was told to put that I resided in TN, under the company's address. The problem is, TN doesn't have a state income tax, they only pay federal. Alabama, on the other hand, has a state income tax. Now that this summer is wrapping up, I think I've been caught with my pants down. And I feel that the company is clueless on how to handle it, because I'm the first out-of-state intern they've ever hired.

Was I supposed to file under Alabama, or pay Alabama's state taxes, even though I was living in Tennessee at the time? I'm really confused, and I feel like the people in payroll don't really know how to handle this.

**TL;DR: Live in AL full-time, spent summer working in TN. Where do I pay taxes?**

Also, if I was supposed to pay state income taxes for Alabama, how do I go about fixing this problem now?",finance,1406588199

I've been doing pretty well in cutting down expenses by minimizing social outings and not spending money for coffee and stuff like that throughout the week. 

I don't want to get hit with a crap top of interest charges, so would applying for something like a bank loan with a lower interest rate or something like the Lending Club help my situation out?

personalfinance,20 year old college student figuring out how much my tax refund will be next year,"Basically I'm just trying to calculate in advance how much my tax refund is going to be for 2014, and am looking for advice on the best way to file.  

I'm 20, in college full-time, and have an internship that I will have a grossed $7,250 by the end of this summer, and that will be my only income for this year.  I'm obviously in the lowest tax bracket, so my federal will be 10% of that ($725), and I pay a 5% Illinois flat state income tax ($362).  I am making the assumption I will not get Medicare and SS back, so those are irrelevant.

I am aware that my standard deduction is $6,200, which I am planning on taking.  This means, I think, that I will pay 10% on the difference between my $7,250 and $6,200.  So at the end of the day my federal income tax paid will be $105 and my refund will be $620.

Here is where I need clarification: I qualify for the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which, as I'll quote from the IRS website: ""is a tax credit of up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year. Also, 40% of the credit (up to $1,000) is refundable. This means you can get it even if you owe no tax.""

So what does this mean?  Am I able to claim this tax credit along with my standard deduction?  Surely the government won't refund me more money than I paid in taxes...  What would be the ideal route to take in my situation?  Much thanks in advance.",finance,1406595253

**Re:	Adverse impact of a proposed rule by the New York State Department of Financial Services on jobs and employment opportunities in the State of New York**


Dear Esteemed Commissioner Adams and Commissioner Rivera:


On July 23, 2014, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) proposed a regulatory framework for virtual currency businesses (the “Proposal”).[1]   By way of this letter, we, members of the virtual currency industry, would like to alert you of the devastating impact the Proposal could inflict on jobs and employment opportunities, especially self-employment opportunities, in the State of New York. We hope you would concur with our assessment of the Proposal below, and urge DFS to conduct additional impact analysis to minimize the Proposal’s unnecessary adverse impacts on employment.

* 1. Blockchain, Virtual Currency and Jobs

The blockchain technology represents the culmination of decades of cryptographic research.  It enables programmatic rules to be enforced in a decentralized manner.  Fascinatingly versatile, the blockchain technology could revolutionize voting, contract execution and internet security.  And just as few could have predicted Twitter and Facebook while the internet was in its infancy, the most innovative uses of the blockchain technology are likely yet to be conceptualized.

When the blockchain technology is utilized for the conveyance and storage of value, virtual currency arises.  Virtual currency can be transferred at any time, from any place, to any person, in tiny or astronomical amounts, with little delay, for close to no charge, and without the need for any financial intermediaries.  For example, it took the United States Marshals Service approximately 10 minutes, and no fee, to transfer about 2 million dollars' worth of bitcoins (a form of virtual currency) to an [auction](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/single-winner-of-all-bitcoins-in-u-s-auction/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1) winner.  This would not be possible with Fedwire, the primary U.S. network for large value bank transfers, which was invented in 1918.[2] 

Virtual currency industry is well positioned to create numerous new and long-term employment opportunities in the State of New York: [hundreds](https://coinality.com/?s=&amp;defaultvalue-clone-002c=All+Jobs&amp;location=New+York%2C+NY%2C+United+States&amp;defaultvalue-clone-09e5=Location&amp;ptype=job_listing&amp;latitude=&amp;longitude=&amp;full_address=&amp;north_east_lng=&amp;south_west_lng=&amp;north_east_lat=&amp;south_west_lat=&amp;radius=0) of virtual currency jobs are currently available to New York residents, and first half of this year alone, more than $113 million have been [invested](http://www.coindesk.com/years-vc-funding-bitcoin-startups-already-beaten-last-years/) in the virtual currency industry, which is about 30% greater than the total amount for the entire year of 2013.  These numbers are set to grow [rapidly](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-bitcoin-disrupt-more-finance-193948828.html) for the years to come.

* 2. The Proposal Could Be Devastating for Virtual Currency Businesses.

If the Proposal is adopted in its current form, it could effectively preclude any self-employment opportunities in the virtual currency industry in New York and may force all but the most well-funded virtual currency businesses to screen off New York in all aspects of their businesses.

Specifically, the Proposal as drafted would require each covered virtual currency business to obtain a license.  To qualify for the license, an applicant must, among other things, maintain a written anti-money laundering plan (including a customer identification program), a written cyber security plan, a written business continuity and disaster recovery plan, a written anti-fraud policy, and a written customer complaint resolution policy, and report quarterly and annually audited financial statements, report suspicious activities to DFS in addition to FinCEN, and retain detailed information of all transactions for 10 years.  An applicant must also post a certain amount of bond or create an equivalent trust account, hire dedicated a compliance officer and a chief information security officer and engage professionals to conduct a variety of costly audits at least annually.

What types of virtual currency businesses are covered?  Almost all.  Subject to narrow exceptions,[3]  if a virtual currency business has a single New York customer, it must comply with the whole suite of licensing requirements even if the business has an innocuous business model, does not target New York, and has a trifling amount of transaction volume. DFS did not consider under the Proposal the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that reflect resources available to small businesses, did not use performance standards rather than design standards, and did not exempt small businesses from coverage subject to the protection of public welfare.  See N.Y. Admin. Proc. Law § 202-B(1).

As such, the Proposal would effectively erect an insurmountable barrier that prevents enterprising proprietors nationwide from entering the virtual currency industry, thereby eliminating employment and self-employment opportunities in New York before they could even emerge.  The narrative of a New York entrepreneur [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2bgwfq/nydfs_it_is_evident_from_the_subject_matter_of/cj5bt4f?context=3) illustrates the Proposal’s adverse impacts succinctly.

* 3. DFS Failed to Consider the Proposal’s Adverse Employment Impacts.

To be sure, we are grateful that DFS is striving to develop a regulatory scheme that would protect customer assets and prevent criminal abuses of virtual currency.  But New York legislature has imposed on all state agencies, including DFS, a statutory mandate to regulate in a way that “minimizes any unnecessary adverse impacts on existing jobs and promotes the development of new employment opportunities, including opportunities for self-employment, for the residents of the state.”  N.Y. Admin. Proc. Law § 201-A(1).  DFS is further bound by the New York Financial Services Law, the law that created DFS, to foster the growth of the financial industry in New York through “judicious” regulation.  N.Y. Fin. Servs. Law § 201(b)(1).

DFS has done just the opposite.  Far from being judicious, DFS has thrust at us a capricious, kitchen-sink-style proposal that is vast in scope, vague in details, and likely void in law: the Proposal would project New York regulatory powers into conduct that occurs wholly outside of the state and would impose enormous burdens on interstate commerce that would likely exceed any derivable local benefits.  The Proposal would thus violate the ""dormant"" Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution if adopted without substantial change.

DFS’s refusal to provide a job impact statement in the Rulemaking Notice further underlines its failure to carefully consider the Proposal’s job impact as required by statute.  DFS argues that no job impact statement is necessary because the intention of the Proposal, which is to “provide the market with guidance and clarity with regard to the use of virtual currency,” renders it “evident” that the Proposal will not only have no adverse impact, but will a positive impact on jobs and employment opportunities in New York.

We disagree.  The statutory burden is for DFS, as a seasoned craftsperson of rules, to sagaciously design new regulations in a way that minimizes any unnecessary adverse impact on employment opportunities.  This, DFS has done not.  Neither DFS’s subjective intent nor the fact that the Proposal may have at least some positive impact on employment opportunities is relevant.

* 4. Conclusions

Therefore, we sincerely hope that, in accordance with Section 201-A(1) of the N.Y. Admin. Proc. Law, your respective departments will concur with us and between each other that DFS must conduct additional analysis to minimize the Proposal’s unnecessary adverse impacts on jobs and employment opportunities in New York, and will jointly transmit a statement of such concurrence to DFS and to State Secretary Cesar A. Perales for publication in the New York Register.

Your intervention in this matter will undoubtedly be of instrumental importance in helping New York become a global center for virtual currency jobs.  If you have any questions or comments on the above, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at jis_petition@gmx.com.

Surprising to many, however, transactions of most types of virtual currency, including bitcoin, are permanently and immutably recorded in their blockchains that are accessible to any person with internet access.  Researchers have demonstrated that the identity of criminals who choose to use virtual currency can almost always be uncovered using computer forensics and law enforcement tools at the disposal of the FBI-led Virtual Currency Emerging Threats Working Group, the FDIC-led Cyber Fraud Working Group, the FinCEN-led Treasury Cyber Working Group, and other state and federal law enforcement units.

I've opened a LLC back in 2010 as a result of a friend's request so he could work 2 full-time positions in 1 place. The corporate policy was that he could only have 1 job, unless he got the 2nd job through a contractor (LLC).  
I opened it under my name and left it for him to manage. He paid me $25-50/week for doing so.  
He would then get a check from the company weekly, deposit at LLC's bank account, issue a direct deposit ($36/month fee for payroll services), leaving only enough to pay his/company's taxes.  
After a while I just stopped watching the bank account. Fast forward 4 years, he got fired from the job and the LLC was not used anymore.  
I was under the impression everything was good, then I received a letter from the IRS a few weeks ago saying I did not file the LLC's federal taxes (940/944 form) in 2011.    
What should I do? It seems like he was only paying state taxes (done at payroll / quarterly), and never filed any federal taxes.      
Should I just ignore the IRS letter, since the company does not exist anymore? Am I in trouble? Not sure what to do.

investing,How to Lend Money with Your Self-Directed IRA,"Self-directed IRAs give you the power to invest in a variety of businesses and products that you wouldn’t be able to utilize with a traditional IRA, but they also allow you to lend out money without actually buying a stake in the company or product. This is a great alternative if you want a slightly lower-risk opportunity that still has the potential to pay off quite well.
 
Lending money from a self-directed IRA isn’t a very complicated process, but it is one that has to be completed carefully. If you make mistakes when setting up the loan, or picking who you loan money to you can end up losing a lot of money. 

1.	Carefully choose a person or company to lend money to. Research the person or company and ensure that they are a worthy cause. 

2.	Sit down with a lawyer and decide on the loan term as well as the interest rate that you believe is fair and profitable.
 
3.	Establish collateral on the loan such as real estate, or an automobile to protect you in case the loan goes bad. 

4.	Submit all of your loan documents to your custodian for approval and a sign off so that the money can be released.
 
5.	The custodian will send the money to the borrower so they can make use of it. 

6.	The borrower will make regular payments to the custodian according to the terms of the contract. 

When you are loaning money to a business or individual out of your IRA it’s important to understand that it’s not your money, it’s the IRA’s. In other words, any contract that you make has to be in your self-directed IRA’s name, not yours. The administrator of your account is the one who has to sign off on the loan agreement, and if the loan ends up being profitable all of those profits have to be rolled back into the account to avoid being penalized. That’s why it’s vital to get professional help when setting up the loan, especially when having the documents drawn up. 

The necessity to keep all the loans out of your name does have some drawbacks by complicating matters, but there are benefits as well. For instance your retirement account will be earning money and you won’t have to worry about managing the loans, instead you have the custodian to handle that. In other words, if you choose your loans properly you’ll have a steady stream of income coming into your retirement fund and you won’t have to devote time to managing it.",finance,1406624178

personalfinance,Student loan debt is killing me.,"I went to culinary school in 2002, and I took out student loans to do so. Student loans covered the entire tuition.  I also decided it would be a great idea to take out loans for living expenses.  These loans were a combination of federal and private loans through Sallie Mae.

A few years after graduating from the program, Sallie Mae started contacting me to start paying back my loans.  This is where I realized I was screwed.  As a cook in Houston, I was not making more than $9/hr.  In 2008 I called it quits and went back to IT, so I could at least make a little more money.

I burned through Sallie Mae deferment, and then I burned through Sallie Mae forbearance.  To become eligible for forbearance, I enrolled into community college part time and started paying out of pocket.  So I guess I'm currently working on a bachelors in business administration/mgmt info systems.  

Well in 2012 I exhausted all possible ways to delay payments.  Sallie Mae now started requiring payment on my loans.  *My original private loans were for 14,000 and 19,000.  Today the 14,000 loan is 29,549.79 and the 19,000 loan is 40,841.  I also have four federal stafford loans totalling 18,499.  My total outstanding balance with Sallie Mae is 88,890.87.*

Originally they wanted me to pay $700 a month, this was in 2012.  I couldn't afford that, as I only make $20/hr.  So they offered me the option of making interest only payments of $425/mo.  I have been paying them interest only payments for two years.  Just this past June, they told me they could only allow me two more years of interest only payments, and then the price will go back up to $700/mo.

What, if any, relief can I seek out?  Should I try a loan consolidation thing?  I'm not sure what that entails.  Should I apply for a credit card to pay off this loan?  I don't have any credit cards, I have a checking and savings account and I have a few other bills--rent, car payment, car insurance, tv/internet, cell.  I'm just worried because I think I really screwed myself delaying my payments for so long, my outstanding bill is so much more than the amount I originally borrowed in student loans.  Is that just years of 7.25% interest building up?  I have to be honest, I don't know much about finances.. was it a mistake to wait so long?  There was just no way I could have afforded a $700/month student loan bill on $9/hr.  I'll barely be able to pay it on $20/hr today.",finance,1406643075

[Follow-up Chart 2](http://i.imgur.com/jMUa1Yg.png)

**Trade #1**: Opened a short position at the top of the bullish candle stick and allocated 5% of portfolio. Added another 5% on the bearish candlestick (the one in black circle), Closed short at 265.

Entry Date: 18th July 2014
Exit Date: 28th July 2014
Projected R/R ratio at Entry: 1.86

Results: -1.79% (Actual), -0.5% (Projected at Entry)

Evaluation: The initial plan was based on technical analysis that K200 would not be able to breach the upper triangle. My reaction to additional developments in the market was appallng. I should have reversed my position right after the fall on 21st as the fall was primarily caused by geopolitical risk in Ukraine and Gaza. I was blinded by the short position (on K200) and my ego which didn't want to start the fiscal year with a losing trade. As a result, I delayed my stop loss to the 264 resistance line and incurred a loss of -1.79% (More than triple amount of my initial stop loss!). In my defense, however, the rationales behind the delay were 1) On 21st, K200 had fallen below the upper triangle line which I immediately assumed that a downward trend would begin. 2) The 40 billion USD fiscal policy was not announced, although much speculated, until breakout above 264. All in all, I had failed to observe events shifting the market sentiment.

Here's my daily trading log for Trade #1. You can skip right away to Trade #2.

Daily Log:
18th July 14 - Despite the ministry of Finance and Bank of Korea boosting optimism in the market through possible policy actions, K200 had failed to breach it's upper triangular resistence line primarily due to increased geopolitical risk in Ukraine and Israel. While it seems unlikely that geopolitical risks will drag down the market further, the technicals show a possibility of a short term pull back. Arithmatically, the risk/reward ratio stands at 1.86 and the stop-loss will be initiated if K200 breaches the upper resistance line of the triangle. In general, I have a mixed feeling about this trade as 1) Geo-political risks are priced in quickly and shouldn't pose as a much threat to the markets - however as I am writing this, the European equity markets are down by roughly 0.5%. 2) Candlestick charts show a pattern never seen before with 2 Dojis followed by bullish belt-hold 3) Volumes have been higher than average for the past three days, supporting the market optimism. Therefore, it is possible that i may be fighting against the trend. The position was set conservatively at 5% of total capital, breakeven price was set at 7665, goal at 7780, and stop-loss at 7625. These represent key support/resistence lines. The position must be closed within next week unless additional bearish events develope. 
21st July 2014 - The market closed lower than open and showed bearish counter-attack candlestick. On top of that, the triangular support broke. Therefore I increased my position by 100% to 40 shares (10%). USDKRW closed lower at 1026.85. I expect that the Stronger won should mitigate the bullish sentiment. 
25th July 2014 - Market had breached the upper triangle line but seems to be struggling under the 264 resistence. Current P/L is - 0.8% and I'm not sure if I should wait and see or cut loss. The last two days have ended in large volumes so that could be a sign that the market is getting ready to jump. 
27th July 2014 - I didn't close the position based on a hunch. To allow the KOSPI to breach through the 264 resistance would require either an improvement in macroeconomic conditions or earnings that beat expectations. Regards the former, BOK is likely to lower the 7 day RP rate and Ministry of Finance is working on lowering the DTI to inflate the housing market. A 39 billion stimulus package by the government was also proposed. The latter, however, is more grim with brokerages lowering expectations for the third quarter. The global economic outlook doesn't seem very hospitable for a rally given that the FED may close QE3 this october. ECB's TLTRO has not even started yet. Therefore, my speculation is that if a rally does persists throughout this month, it might be short lived. 
28th July 2014 - The 264 level was breached. Position Closed.

**Trade #2**: Opened a long position at 265.5 (I waited until about 15 minutes before the market close to ensure that K200 had breached the 264 level. This time I allocated 100% of my capital.

Entry Date: 28th July 2014
Exit Date: 29th July 2014
Projected R/R ratio at Entry: 1.61

Results: +0.85% (Actual), +0.93% (Projected at Entry)

Evaluation: I conducted this trade simultaneously as I closed my KODEX INV #1 position. I speculated that the breach of 264 following the announcement of fiscal policy (40 Billion USD) would enforce the bullish sentiment and eventually inflate KOSPI to 270. 

Daily Log: 28th July 2014 - Following the Kodex inverse #1 trade, I went long after the breach of 264 resistance line as the next resistence was either at 268 (Upper Channel) or 270 (2nd of Jan fall). Position was entered at 265.5, stop-loss at 264, and target at 270. 29th July 2014 - Closed my position at 268 because KOSPI approached the upper channel and I wanted to play it safe. The fed announcement this weekend of rolling back QE3 could make investors pull back a little on their long positions before the actual meeting. The RSI indicated a sharp spike towards the 70s line and many stocks that compose 50% weight in K200 showed abnormal spike in prices and the upper band of Bollinger Band was breached. Most importantly K200 had reached the upper band of the bullish channel. Had I entered my position sooner than 265, I would have maintained my bets and see the events unfold. THe fact that I entered near the top made me feel uneasy. 

I will appreciate any feedbacks and criticisms. I know this wasn't a good trade and had I not allocated 100% of my capital (which in itself is considered a huge risk), I probably wouldn't recovered my losses. But, I did feel extremely confident that once 264 was breached, it'd be easy for K200 to reach 268.",finance,1406655243
CryptoCurrency,Opinions on the future of cryptocurrency?,"Hello.

First off, I would like to apologize about posting on such a broad topic, assuming that by commenting your truthful, personal, opinion on the future of cryptocurrency, you will put a lot of time and effort explaining your predictions into a comment on this post, just as I have, with the post. 

But anyway, here's my ""theory"" on it. I think that it's composed of several reasonable, unbiased predictions, but a couple holes and unanswered questions as well.

Assuming that you've done research on bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general (including altcoins), it's likely that you realize its purpose, and how messed up the Federal Reserve actually is. The dollar has lost almost all of its value. This is why you can purchase a quarter from the 60's for $5 today. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that a quarter was more than 90% silver back then, and it's less than 5% silver today (something like that).

You could also work on minimum wage ($1.50/hr), and buy an ounce of gold for 20 hours of work ($30). Today, you can work for $11/hr, and you can't buy an ounce of gold from 200 hours of work (why I'm against raising minimum wage and I get called an asshole for it... it dramatically encourages inflation... and people who work on minimum wage are too stupid to realize that for the most part... that they'll be getting more bills, but it will have less value as a whole). 

We're in a huge deficit, and every time it gets smaller, it actually doesn't. Because all we do is print another couple trillion dollars to ""pay it off."" 


Almost everyone that owns a house in the suburbs, or a vehicle in the U.S. bought it on a loan. So when the Federal Reserve crashes (which the elite ironically want it to), it would give the government the right to enforce marshal law on U.S. citizens in debt (more than half of them), and since the dollar would crash, they would not be able to pay that debt off forever, and become slaves to the tyrannical government. 

This way, instead of controlling the media, politicians, and food (with gmo's), central banks could directly control and enslave the people upfront, instead of hiding behind their money and controlling every necessity of modern life.

They would actually have more control this way, even over the very small portion of people that understands exactly what they're doing.

The government hasn't really cared about any open source computer codes before. Why bitcoin? 

Because bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can defeat the government's evil plot. Money will finally be decentralized, and there will be no ""elite,"" and we don't have to resort to communism either... even though we've only been in the illusion of a free market system this whole time..(regulated free market) is really just another bullsh*t paradox in my mind. 

Let's just take bitcoin as an example. The government keeps trying to control it, and they continue to fail... 
Examples:


1. IRS demands 5% property tax to all bitcoin owners (effect: rate goes down, but then goes back up). I'm assuming people either thought it was worth it, or they just anonymously use it anyway without paying taxes through the deep web or something.

2. FBI sells 30,000btc confiscated from S.R. First off.. this is extreme hypocrisy. They stole bitcoin from a bunch of, what they consider to be criminals, and then sold it to the general public? They didn't just make a couple million dollars though... By engaging in a dump that big, bitcoin plummeted for the next few weeks. 

And there were several other, less, serious things that the feds did to attempt to dissipate bitcoin value. However, cryptocurrency is self healing. And it actually has true value... or at least more than that of the dollar. This is because it has a market cap, so the value will just continue to increase, as the demand for it does. That's the beauty of it. So eventually, when everyone is using it, the value will stabilize. 

It hasn't been the free market that is the issue, which communists really have not figured out yet. It's the centralized bankers that have been the issue... who also play a part in communist countries. 

It's the people that mint the money, and decide how much is printed that screw everything up, not the hardworking industries. 

And now I just find it purely beautiful that so many businesses are starting to accept bitcoin, and even other cryptocurrencies, and how well they're doing. 

I think this is the way out. Most people are sheep, and many haven't even heard of cryptocurrencies. They don't know how deep this goes and how much of a slave they actually are under the central banking elites. 

I think that cryptocurrency is the greatest technological innovation since the internet. 

The internet of communication has reached its peak... And now is the time for the internet of finance. 

It's a really historical time that we're living in, and most people don't even understand how big this is.",cryptocurrency,1406655668

OK, OK - so, I'm a 38YO lady living in a high-cost city who at first thought she was going to buy a house and needed an emergency fund. So....I stocked away cash (83K of it), and bought some stocks outside of my 401k(OK, just my company's stock - and that was combination of RSUs and me putting dollars into it - all in all I have 40K direct in my company's stock and 15% of my 200K 401K invested there).

Financial goals - 

I just like the thought of having 1 year's living expenses accessible for an emergency.  I have a good job, but the search would be long to find another and in my industry getting cut is all together possible.

I rent, it's not a good time to buy in an expensive City and with the job up in the air.  I can continue to rent, I have no issues with that.

Income - I make about 220K a year, and save 35K in 401K per year, and stock away about 20K in cash per year (Really just got going here).  

Retirement: I don't live every day thinking about retiring early (Although I admire those on here who have that focus!).  I'd simply like to not over-spend and have FLEXIBILITY now and later to come/go to jobs I want and to be completely independent in my early 60's (Read, not have to work).  Who knows, some lucky guy might eventually marry me - but that's another sub-reddit :)

The question - I clearly am over-leveraged in my own company (40K in direct stocks, 30K in 401K) - if I unwind some of those positions, where the should the money go?

I have too much cash on hand, I know this (83K with 15K sitting in brokerage and the rest in a lowish yield savings account).  What's the best near-term strategy with this if I don't want to buy in the next 12 months?

Finally - I realize that the amount that I'm saving (I didn't include additional options I get) is too little for my salary but, hey, I like to go out to eat and I definitely sacrifice the future a bit for the now.  I'm working on that - so please don't be too harsh!

Bitcoin,"Snapcard loves bit license. Purse.io, anyone?","Here's what Michael from Snapcard had to say about bit license in a blog post just pushed out to their e-mail list.

Hey everyone!

There’s been a lot of talk about the Bitlicense throughout the past week and I thought it would be a good time to summarize what it is / what it means, and also give some thoughts to what it will mean for consumers and for entrepreneurs entering the digital currency space.

I’ve taken the information provided here as a point of reference. It doesn’t cover every single detail, but it covers some of the main points. Feel free to add your thoughts below.

There are a lot who skeptics that argue that New York’s Bitlicense creates for entrepreneurs barriers to entry (which it naturally does) but in the same token it takes away one of the real pain points for entrepreneurs (especially in the Bitcoin community) of gaining trust as being a reputable, honest, and accountable service.

Right off the bat, it’s important to note that the Bitlicense isn’t relevant for all businesses touching Bitcoin (and it shouldn’t be). It’s focused to Bitcoin businesses that act as an Bitcoin exchange, digital currency payment processor, or Bitcoin wallet.

**Anti-Money Laundering**

&gt;Maintain a detailed record of each transaction that includes the parties’ identities and physical addresses, the value and dates of the transaction, the method of payment used, and a description of the transaction

&gt;Verify customers’ identities when opening customer accounts and check them against the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control’s Specially Designated Nationals list.

&gt;Enhanced diligence would be required for accounts involving foreign entities, and accounts on behalf of foreign shell entities would be prohibited.

&gt;Notify NYDFS of any transactions that might signify illegal or criminal activity and when an individual engages in transactions that exceed US$10,000 in a single day.

If you’re a registered Money Service Business, all of the above is already quite standard. Knowing the physical address is not new to identity verification procedures. While it might seem infuriating, it’s been par for the course for companies for awhile.

Companies such as Bitstamp, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, have an extremely thorough verification process. Now it’s not ideal for me as a user, but if it means that Bitstamp is going to exist and I get the same level of quality product, then it’s not a big deal from my side. I’d rather have them exist and verify my ID, knowing they’re not going to be shut down the next day, as opposed to knowing the site could go offline at any time for one reason or another.

It references having a “description” of the purchase. This is a little interesting. I know that Coinbase has started doing this in their procedures and there was a little bit of kick back from the community. This isn’t Coinbase wanting to know where you’re shopping and what you’re buying for their own reasons; this is Coinbase maintaining their level of regulatory compliance.

With all this being said, these are measures that worked for previous technologies. It could be time with Bitcoin to change that process, make it more efficient, and give users the privacy they seek while still maintaining some form of customer understanding.

**Consumer Protection**

&gt;To the extent a Licensee stores virtual currency on behalf of a third party, the Licensee would have to hold virtual currency of the same type and amount as that which is owed or obligated to a third party.

&gt;Maintain a bond or trust account (in U.S. dollars) for the benefit of its customers in a form and amount acceptable to NYDFS.

&gt;Provide customers with a receipt for each transaction with information about the firm’s name and address, specifics of the transaction, and statements about the Licensee’s liability for non-delivery and refund policy.

&gt;Disclose to consumers the material risks associated with virtual currencies, in writing, both in English “and in any other predominant language spoken by the customers of the Licensee.”

&gt;Each Licensee shall be permitted to invest its retained earnings and profits in only the following high-quality, investment-grade permissible investments with maturities of up to one year and denominated in United States dollars:

&gt;(1) certificates of deposit issued by financial institutions that are regulated by a United States federal or state regulatory agency;

&gt;(2) money market funds;

&gt;(3) state or municipal bonds;

&gt;(4) United States government securities;

&gt;(5) United States government agency securities

BitLicense businesses cannot invest or hold their ANY of their profit in Bitcoin, ONLY in US Dollars.

It was stated that companies must only and always have USD, and are not allowed to keep profits in Bitcoin, etc.

First, this means that a company based in Europe must now utilize USD at all times. This seems like it’s worded very poorly from the regulators part because then the investments they’re referring to must be ridiculously low risk… (this paragraph was a little confuding to me, I may not have gotten the correct meaning)

One part of me says they’re trying to really take the life out of Bitcoin by not giving companies a chance at utilizing it completely for their operations. Another part thinks that it’s more comcerned about companies that are day-trading with Bitcoin (either profits or customer funds) and moving the market.

The latter gives me some optimism that the regulators are aware of how big this will become. So when institutional level banks are really entrenched in the Bitcoin economy, it will take away their ability to move the market. Regardless, this does need a lot of clarification. It feels very rushed from the regulators standpoint.

**Cyber Security**

&gt;Designate a qualified employee to serve as a Chief Information Security Officer responsible for implementing &gt;a cyber security program to identify cyber risks, protect systems from unauthorized access, detect data &gt;breaches, and respond to system breaches and unauthorized use.

&gt;Conduct system penetration testing at least annually and vulnerability assessments at least quarterly.

**This fair enough.**

Companies use this as a way to also promote their operations as being efficient and secure. Giving the company a somewhat “seal of approval” to add confidence to the consumers. Examples of this have already happened. I know for me personally, Andreas is someone who’s opinion I take extremely seriously. He’s a rockstar in the Bitcoin world! So when he gives something the tick of approval, it certainly goes very far for Entrepreneurs in the community.

Perhaps we should introduce an Andreas Icon! It gets put onto websites that have been verified, do away with the Bitlicense, and consider that the tick of approval? Mentioned as a joke, but for me as a community member, that would actually mean more than a “Bitlicense” label at the moment :)

But seriously, for entrepreneurs this is a good way to provide legitimacy for our users and potential users. The closest thing I’ve seen to this is CrowdCurity, who is doing great things for entrepreneurs to secure their sites in a more budget friendly way. You’ll see they’ve got a big focus on Bitcoin companies in their client list.

**Capital Requirements**

&gt;Maintain at all times such amount of capital as NYDFS determines. The proposed rules do not set forth any specific minimum levels of capital or methods for computing required capital. Rather, the proposal would permit NYDFS to determine the required amount of capital on a case-by-case basis, after considering such factors as the Licensee’s assets and liabilities, the amount of leverage used by the firm, the liquidity position of the firm, and extent to which additional financial protection is provided for customers.

This is very similar to money transmission regulations… (Which are ridiculously messy for entrepreneurs to be honest. They vary from state to state and just provide headache after headache after headache.) For example, if I’m a money transmitter and have $150M in transactions going through my service everyday, but our cash at bank is $10,000, it provides zero margin for error in our operations and thus places more risk on consumers. It would give me a lot more confidence to give them my money as opposed to a company that doesn’t have any sort of capital reserve in the event of a problem. That’s an oversimplified example of course, but as a user, I know wallet providers/exchanges/payment processors should have this (but it should be much more clear and concise to remove the ambiguity which requires paying legal teams to help decipher it). Money Transmission Wiki

**Financial Reporting and Audit**

&gt;Submit quarterly and annual financial statements to NYDFS. Annual statements are to be audited and submitted with an opinion of an independent certified public accountant and an evaluation by the accountant of the firm’s accounting procedures and internal controls.

This is necessary if you’re a wallet provider/exchange in my opinion. Companies are already doing independent audits to promote their legitimacy. It’s good for business. As a user, as a company, everyone wins. Example. Now, does this cost money for entrepreneurs? Yes. But what would I gain from it?

Well, I know that a user is going to be much more inclined to go with a well audited business, so for me, this is a business expense but it’s worth it’s weight in gold to show that we didn’t just whip up an exchange overnight, we’ve got proven legitimacy from reputable (reputable is a key word) 3rd parties.

If you’re familiar with the Online Poker space, there was a day called “Black Friday"" which was basically the day when Full Tilt Poker was found to actually be using their players funds for company operations/spending/employee salaries etc.. This essentially means they were depending on user deposits (or as the saying goes Robbing Peter to pay Paul) - The result of this is that US players can no longer make deposits to major online poker sites (like Pokerstars) and thus the whole online poker industry took a huge decline as the USA is so influential in it. Essentially it was like a Mt. Gox, but for poker. What that means is that if Mt. Gox were to happen in the USA, the consumer protection ramifications could really damage the potential opportunity for the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.

I know that no matter what, Bitcoin will still exist. However, if credit card processors and all banks never allow any form of deposits into Coinbase/Circle etc., the adoption of Bitcoin will be slowed down in the US. Adoption in the US isn’t where the real benefit for this currency is, but it still provides a lot of influence for the development of infrastructure. Meaning if it’s a new hot property in the US, then you increase investor interest. If investor interest increases, then the entrepreneur interest increases. If entrepreneurial interest increases, more products hit the market. This leads to awesome people building awesome things that can be used globally and helps create an infrastructure for it to grow faster and faster.

I feel like I’ve been rambling, and if you got this far, thanks for reading my thoughts!

In summary, I think the NYC Bitlicense offers legitimacy for everyday users and help hold companies accountable. It also can be looked at as a business investment for entrepreneurs, not just a drain on resources. It shouldn’t be relevant to all Bitcoin businesses.

The proposed regulations seem very rushed and require a lot more thought in order to help Bitcoin keep the things that are awesome about it. Regulators gonna regulate.

Thanks for reading!

Michael.

2: Getting a 15 year, 3.5% mortgage and putting down only $100,000. The remaining money would then by split up between more stocks, funds and savings. We would be running a monthly deficit of $700, which we would continuously pull out of the savings. Our reasoning behind considering this is, due to the low rate, we believe that it would be possible to get a higher interest rate from our stocks. This would then offset the mortgage interest on the other $150,000 that would have been put down in Option 1 and actually earn some money.

* Contribute $300/paycheck to 401k
* ~$1000 in liquid savings currently

**Income**

* After taxes, regular debt payment, rent, etc. I end up with about $1500/mo left over. Often, that goes to things like lunches but I am now starting to live more frugally (bringing lunch, no more Amazon :) ) hoping to see more of that money in my pocket.

As of now I have been living a pretty regular life day-to-day and felt somewhat comfortable. I live in a major city and my rent is fairly high ($1,800) but otherwise the one night a week out with friends is my only non-debt expense. Yet, given my upcoming trial (small claims) and the uncertainty of it, I starting to really feel the burden of all my debt from over the last 3 years or so. I feel stuck though and don't know where to start.

So Reddit, other than the obvious of keep paying monthly minimums and paying off the highest interest rates first. Any other advice for me? What should my realistic time expectations of paying this off be?

personalfinance,"Here are my student loan ""hacks""...are there any I'm missing?","X-post from /r/StudentLoans, as I'm not getting much feedback there.


I'm (23/F) paying $1100/month on my government issued student loans which currently amount to $48,900 (at varying interest rates, but mostly around 6.55%). I only take home about $2440/month, so I'm giving almost half my income to the loans. According to unbury.us, If I keep this up I can pay that entire amount off by the end of 2019! Woo!



**Here are the ""hacks"" I know of and employ:**


*Signed up for the income based repayment plan.

*Set my loan to auto-pay the amount required by the plan. (For my loan servicer and some others, it lowers the interest rate a bit)

*I then make a second payment later in the month of ANYTHING ELSE I CAN AFFORD to on the loan with the highest interest rate. I try to pay a minimum of $1100/month between the required payment and this extra one. Sometimes if I'm feeling bold, I make this payment at the beginning of the month and am forced to live within my means.

*Throw any extra money towards the loan. This includes money from my second part-time job on weekends, from tutoring gigs, etc.


*At tax time, claim the $2500 I've paid in interest as a wage deduction (or whatever it's called exactly)



**Is there anything at all I'm missing here?** 


My current job doesn't qualify as any sort of public service loan forgiveness thing, so consider that out of the question in this situation. Also, I've whittled my budget down as much as possible at this point and established an emergency fund which I keep in a high interest savings account through an online bank.

Once the estate is settled and split between the eight remaining kids, my mother should be set to inherit about 150,000$. In the last few years she has experienced some mental health issues and is now being taken care of by my 27 year old brother.
 
I am a 21 year old senior in college who, come graduation next May, will be about 44$ grand in debt. Most of my tuition is paid for, the debt comes mostly from cost of living as I do go to a private liberal arts school that requires three year on campus residency as well as meal plans, student fees, etc. I'm not able to hold a job during the school year because I'm a college athlete, and I don't have a car, which is absolutely necessary as I live in Northwestern US and public transportation really isn't a thing. 

My mother has expressed that she wants to give my brother and I each a gift of 10,000$. This is where my first question comes from; what is the best use that I could put 10,000$ dollars to? 
Should buying a car be a first priority since I am graduating soon, and it will be a necessity to finding a job, or should I put all the money into my federal(subsidized and unsubsidized) loans?

I was also hoping I could get some advice on what my brother and mother should do. They've expressed interest in possibly buying a home together, as she does need to continue receiving his care, and they are currently living in a small two bedroom apt. Neither of them have much money to speak of, she lives off of her disability check and he works two jobs, one as a bartender the other at a grocery store.

I'm pretty sure their interest rate is somewhere at or about the 20% range. I have really good credit for my age (22) at about 750+ and the really good news is that I just got out of college with a 4 year degree with no student loans. 

Regarding my work predicament, I have several big time job interviews lined up for huge companies that could totally change my situation around, but of course, nothing's really guaranteed in life.

I'm seriously making efforts on limiting myself by cutting back on buying lunch, coffee, beer with friends, etc.

personalfinance,Consolidating credit card debt with a student loan,"This seems like the right place to ask.

I'm in my early 30's and have been accepted as a transfer student into a program where I will only need to complete senior year.

I'm getting ready to start the program in the fall and will be getting a student loan to fund my tuition.

I don't have much in savings, no real retirement to speak of, but my only real debt is my car payment and roughly $2500 in credit card debt across three cards, all in the ballpark of a 20-25 percent interest rate.

from my monthly budget, roughly $200 is allotted to paying these cards, with minimum payments on two and the reminder going to card with the highest interest rate.

Generally I think it's irresponsible to rack up student loans, particularly if you are using them for something besides school.

Currently I work a fulltime job as well a second part time job for extra income. I can scrape by and pay the bills with my fulltime job alone, but barely.

I'm going to continue working full time, but I also qualify for living expenses, which i don't really need since I'll continue working and can cover my bills.

My rational is that this accomplishes two things...

1. Significantly lowers the interest rate on the debt

2. Effectively lowers my monthly budget by $200, which hopefully translates into having a bit more time for school and takes some of the strain of extra shifts away

The deal is, the program will provide the down payment as a 0% interest, non-amortizing loan and as long as you don't move in the first 5 years, 20% of that loan is ""forgiven"" per year. Although the interest rates on the loan are a little higher, there are also big discounts on PMI. It seems like a good option for young professionals that don't have a ton of savings.

Given the fact that my boyfriend and I have discussed saving for a house, wedding, grad school, etc and accumulating all that cash seems overwhelming... this seems like an attractive offer. (We have minimal debt in the form of school loans, but also limited savings.) Each of us individually makes under the $125k cap, but as a household we are over - so we couldn't both be on the mortgage. Even if we could be, I'm sure many on this forum would agree that it's not the best idea until we officially tie the knot.

Car is about 12k left with 1.9% with a payment of 285 but I just round to 300 each month.


Question is.  By the end of the year, I can pay off debt number 3 and the car while making my other minimums.

However, my finance side says to put money towards the higher interest rates.

My personal side says a lower required monthly payment makes my life that much safer.

I'm looking at changing jobs.  I bring home 6k/mo right now after taxes and have up my lease so no housing expense.  However, this will only last until April next year when I'll go back to 4k take home and have to buy a van to avoid housing expenses.

I have had a hell of a week. My car was totaled a few days ago, my living situation fell through, and my parents cut me off financially with school starting back in about two weeks.

I'm 22 years old, about to start my 5th year at Georgia Tech (I'm double majoring and expect to be in school 4 more semesters which will take 2 more years since the classes I need are not offered in the summer.) I have only had credit history for the last year and a half -- a credit card which I have never missed a payment on, and whatever credit is established by setting up utilities in your name.

I'm not concerned about taking out loans; I'm pursuing degrees in Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry, and relatively speaking, Chem E's coming out of Tech with my credentials have excellent job placement and salaries, so I am confident in my ability to pay off the loans I need to take out. My problem is actually getting the loans. On my last tax return, I filed as a dependent and my parents claimed me. Now, they are no longer willing to be involved with my finances, so I'm basically living as an independent, but my last tax filing doesn't reflect that. They are also unwilling to cosign, and without anyone co-signing on private loans, I cannot receive them, and as a dependent, my chances of getting need based federal loans are a lot less.

My parents have agreed to relinquish my status as a dependent, but I don't even know how to go about making that change. I would like to avoid getting into debt, but I do not make enough money to support myself and go to school at the same time, so there is no way around taking out loans that is really feasible right now. To give an idea, I'm going to need about $11,000 for school, another $10,000 for rent, utilities, and other living expenses (which I am supplementing with my own income, I just made the mistake of signing a lease for a place I couldn't afford on my own only to have the other occupant back out.) I haven't even begun to think about replacing my car, I will be living close enough to campus/work that biking is an option, so that's what I'll be doing for now.

- Obtain a similar State employer identity number
- Withhold necessary federal, state, and unemployment tax
- Obtain some workers comp protection (though my state doesn't require it)

I used to carry a balance of $700 on a $750 limit credit card (like most, I was uneducated in best financial practices when I was younger) but paid that off completely a few months ago and now keep my utilization at 3-7% when my statement posts.  And I had $62k in student loans with various interest rates ranging from 2.75 and 6.8% which I was paying off $172 a month at the time. 

    
**credit score**  
Credit Karma/TU: 675
Experian's credit monitoring system: 635. 
(I understand these are both FAKOs and I do intend on paying to get all 3 FICO scores once my loan payoffs post to my credit reports.)

Among all three credit reports, the only outstanding issue is a total of 7 late payments: 

--Cap One--  
12/2011: 30 days  
10/2012: 30 days  
04/2013: 30 days  

--Sallie Mae--  
08/2013: 60 days  
11/2013: 90 days  
12/2013: 120 days  
01/2014: 120 days  

The Sallie Mae reporting confuses me a little bit. I don't know how I can all of a sudden jump from no late payment on 07/2013 to 60 days late or 90 days late in 11/2013. So I intend on mailing Sallie Mae to ask about those as well as requesting a goodwill removal due to all of my loans now being paid off in full. (I realize my chances are slim with that.) 
  
The other two problems on my CR are total available credit (only $750) and length of accounts (due to my youth.)

As you can understand, this has given my mom, my sister, and I a new lease on life and is providing us financial security that my father was never able to give to us in life. My mom immediately wanted to pay off both my sister and I's student loans, which we've done. She is taking the majority to pay off many outstanding debts and to fix up her current house to get it into a salable condition so she can sell it and move into a smaller, more manageable row house for an empty nester. 


——Future——
Now I am debt free. (It is an incredible feeling although I'd trade it in for a second to get my dad back.) And I have no foreseeable debts in my future until a mortgage. (I am interested in grad school but will only do it if I were to get a very good scholarship or can pay for it myself.) I also intend on switching jobs in the next couple of months. I'm very fortunate in that this won't be too difficult given my industry and location. And I expect to be making between $75k and $85k at my next place. 


Now, my question:  
Is there anything I could do to improve my credit score? I’ve been getting cc offers so I’m thinking opening another line of credit and playing the waiting game is the only thing  I can do at this point since I pay my cc bill on time and keep utilization low already. 

And investing-wise: I’m planning on waiting until I get to my new job to open my 401k and until then, starting to put maybe ~20% of my paycheck towards a real emergency fund. I’m also going to read Boglehead’s Guide to Investment book to get a better understanding of my options through proven strategies. 


If anyone has any other suggestions for things I should be doing with my expendable income, I’d greatly appreciate it. 

    
——**TLDR**——  
I make $63,500 + small bonuses (moving jobs soon to make somewhere between $75-85k)  
I have $1k in savings  
I have no debt  
I have no retirement plan  
CR is at ~635 due to 7 late payments in my past  
  
Is there anything I can do besides open a new credit line + wait in order to improve my score?
What, aside from opening a 401k should I do with my money to make up for lost time so I can retire at a decent age?

personalfinance,Should I start investing now?,"Without giving away too much info about myself, here we go:


- I'm in my early 20s, living in Canada

- I'm in a professional degree program, expecting to graduate in 2016

- I have a line of credit from my bank, for up to a total of 250k, interest is charged at prime rate

- Up to today I have accumulated about 80k of debt on my credit line, on top of that I have about 50k of government student loans (which are interest free until I finish school)

- I recently applied for student loans in the upcoming year, this process was completed a week ago

- I would like to start building a portfolio using money from my line of credit (3% prime interest rate)


Here's the catch: I know that 1 year from now I will need to apply for gov't student loans once again (that will be the last time that I apply for gov't loans because I'll be graduated the following year). When I do, I will need to empty all my investments back into my line of credit to show that I am in debt and do not have any assets. However, I can buy back into my securities a week later when the loan application process is finished. I'm thinking of putting 20k into a TFSA right now, which I can liquidate next year and then put money back in a week after (the caveat being that my contribution amount will be reduced for that year). Is this a feasible idea?

I have been a PNC customer for 4 years, and applied for a $250 limit secure credit card. I got denied due to excessive debt to income. Some things about me: 

* I'm 21 years old, college student who works all year. When I'm working full time, I make about $1200 biweekly. When I'm not working full time, I'll make around $400-500 biweekly. 
* Because of how much I make, I estimate my income at $10,000/year
* I have exclusively taken out federal loans for college, and owe around $70,000 currently, which don't need to be paid off until I graduate
* In the letter my bank sent denying me, they said they got their credit information on me from Experian. Experian reported that my credit score is 669. I have no clue how this number was generated because I do not have any credit cards at all. I have checked my credit score from annual credit report and Experian, and when I checked personally, it said I do not have a credit score. How could this be? 
* What are my options now? I want to start building my credit, and I'm scared of getting denied again. I'm responsible and continually making money. I don't know how my credit score could be so low to them when on two separate occasions I don't even have one. 
* EDIT: I also got denied from the Capital One Journey Student card. I really feel like I can't win and I'm frustrated :(

That said, I'd like to pay it off even sooner.  I'm tapped out on how much more I can pay per month, so the only thing left is to figure out out how to lower the interest rate.  

Thus, my plan:  A regular re-finance to 3% or so would be a wash because of closing fees.  But, after checking out some local banks, a few offer HELOCs and HOLs between and 3 and 4% with minimal or even no closing fees.  I'm tempted to open two or even three HOLs/HELOCs at rates below 5.5% and use those lines to effectively buy out the mortgage, and thus reduce my rate.

The house has been appraised at $220,000.

Are there any legal limits on the number of liens against a property?  I suppose the bank that is third in line for liens  might be worried in case of a default, but the property is worth plenty enough to make up for exposed amount.

personalfinance,Need advice on a newly discovered debt 8 months from California's SOL,"Hi everyone, I'm grateful to any and all help you can give me!

A few weeks ago I was signed up for CreditKarma for the first time and realized that the student loan amount listed there didn't match the federal loan website's amount. Investigating further, I found out that my father took out a shady-ass private student loan from a company called MyRichUncle which was, in fact, so shady that it went into bankruptcy in 2007. (Thanks, Dad!!) The loans were bought by a new company, Younomics, which as far as I can tell isn't a collections agency, just a debt buyer - and my loan is *not* listed as being in collections, only delinquent. Obviously, since I only discovered this debt last week, I've never made a payment on it. The open date for the loan was 2007, but it looks like the loan first went late in 2011. I graduated in June 2010 and remember there was a brief deferment, so that sounds about right.

Here are the things to note:

* After doing research online, the only thing I can find about Younomics is a lot of people in similar situations, discovering ancient loans from this group, and *never getting contacted by Younomics*. 
* Nobody on the Internet seems to be able to find proper contact information for this company. It took digging to find a phone number, but it just leads to a voicemail machine.
* I live, and have always lived, in California with a statute of limitations of 4 years.
* While I might be able to save up enough to pay the principle in a lump sum after a few years, there's absolutely no way I can start making real and regular payments on the principle + interest, which has now ballooned to $15k.

1) When did the state of limitations on this loan begin? Rather, did it restart when Younomics purchased the loan? Remember they are not a collections agency, and my loan is not listed as being in collections. In case I'm reading CreditKarma incorrectly, [here is a screenshot of what I'm seeing](http://i.imgur.com/4Kg42mf.png).

2) If the loan is this close to the SOL, and if other people have successfully run out the clock in the past, **should I go ahead and run the risk of running out the clock?**

I know that making a partial payment will restart the clock. My hope would be to run out the SOL, then spend a few years saving up enough for the principle, and then contact them about arranging a pay-for-delete to repair my credit later. I searched Reddit and the only earlier post I could find on this subject was from someone whose loan had already passed the SOL. My biggest worry is how to play the next 8 months.

* 4K into an ETF on oil funds ($)
* 4K into an double levaraged ETF on a stock market index.
* 1K in my chekings account.

I have been able to increase my income during this year. I have been savin those 400~700€ into my saving accounts; would it be worth investing my money somewhere else? I have invested into public bonds in the past, but right now they give a very low interest rate.

Also, am I balancing correctly the risk of losing my investments vs safe savings with low interest rate? Would you recommend buying stocks instead of using leveraged ETFs in my case?

I'm a long-time lurker and I've found and used a lot of great information from this sub. Now that I've got a legit full-time job, I'm doing some real saving and investing into retirement. I've got a few questions though, and would also like to provide my current strategy for feedback. Here goes!

First, here's my current set up:

**Debt**

Student Loan (1) = ~$18,900 (includes subbed/unsubbed loans from 3.4% to 6.8% interest rates)

Student Loan (2) = ~$16,100 (subbed/unsubbed loans from 6% to 
6.8%)

All of these loans are deferred, as I'm still in school for another year.

**Income**

Gross annual income: $40,250/year

Net annual income (insane taxes for young single folks): $28,800

This comes out to about $1,200 every two weeks. $1.1k after retirement contributions.

**Savings**
Current placing a range of $300-$500 in my Savings account each month. Currently at $700 total. Just got paid today though, so wondering how much should be set aside this check.

**Retirement**
401k = 6% with 6% match.

Roth 401k = 3% with no match.

Total currently sits at ~$700.

-----------

This is a pretty consistent pattern on a month-to-month basis. My top priority has been to put money away in both retirement and savings. I had quite a bit more until needing to pay to move into my apartment, deposits, movers, truck, new bills, etc. but I'm still on the wagon.

I've cut out most of my unnecessary spending, other than fast food or generally eating out, which is a big sink for my wallet (spent over $300 on eating out this month alone, but this was before my apartment).

I've used retirement calculators before to determine approximations for what I'd be looking at at my current rate of contribution and by only speculative rates of interest and inflation, but would like some human eyes to review what I've got going on.

My goal isn't to just get by when I retire, I want to be well off. I want to be able to travel, have a decent home ($100k-$250k), and possibly live abroad. Nothing truly extravagant, but I want to know what I worked for.

Any ideas on how to further propel myself into this direction?

Long story short, they delivered the u-verse equipment about 2-3 weeks BEFORE the install date, at an apartment I wasn't even living in yet. The package then turned up missing. By then I was so fed up with ATT from all this I cancelled everything and requested not to set up service. 

About a month later my landlord shows up with my package saying ""hey we found it, we had it all along"" (this place was so freaking shady/weird). Then I was able to return the equipment they shipped out for a service they never even set up. Did not deal with a technician or anything what so ever.

Once I was able to get the lost equipment, I mailed it back to ATT. Then a few months later I get a bill that I owe them money for services I never received.

The young naive side of me thought if I ignored it, it would go away. Stupid me. 

Then I started getting the typical debt collection notices. Finally I disputed one back in August 2013. After I mailed back the debt collector with my dispute, I recieved an unsolicited email from ATT stating that

personalfinance,Unique student loan situation: Received $22k to use on loans. Current debt of $23k. Best repayment plan?,"New user here. Pretty clueless about personal finance, already checked out the sidebar and student loan links. Didn't see a situation like this covered.

Long story short, I was given $22k to pay off student loan debts (and only student loans). Don't want to get into details about that online, but it's nothing shady. Really.

Although my first inclination is to just throw it all at my loans, I realize there may be better strategies. There are no stipulations on how the money is to be managed so long as it eventually is used to pay off the loans. I'd love to get PF's opinions on how to best utilize this super freaking awesome situation.

personalfinance,Need some advice on saving money.,"Hello r/personalfinance

I recently moved back from california, let's just say I was stupid with my money and decided to buy a brand new car, get credit cards, and anything else possible to get me by. Being a young adult, the thought of me being pre approved for a 20k 2013 car was exciting for me and I quickly jumped on that. Now I'm stuck with a $400/month payment with $100 for insurance. My credit cards are not maxed, but close. I live back home so rent isn't an issue. I make about 1,200/month (sigh). My credit card has a 23.75% interest rate which im figuring I should pay that off first. Now that you understand what I'm saying (I hope) what are simple ways I can save here and there? I expect rude answers but I don't know where else to post this. 

Edit: I appreciate all the feedback guys. I understand I'm an idiot for buying the car.. I am looking to sell it yes. Overall, I think I just needed to have someone tell me I'm an idiot to reassure myself that it's not just me. Thanks again, guys.",finance,1406821691

Bitcoin,Thoughts on Regulation,"It seems about every day we get a highly upvoted post here saying that regulation doesn't apply to bitcoin, and it's all a way for the rich to steal your money, and how Ben Lawsky should go suck a dick. Well I'm not here to tell you the Bitlicense is a good thing, and you should all suck up to New York's regulations because they said so.

But I am here to say that regulations aren't *inherently* bad.

Regulations can be very good at protecting people. If it weren't for laws and regulations, murder would go unpunished, taxes would be optional, and companies could dump as much sewage as they want into the river closest to you. Now I'm sure you have your arguments about that, and I'll get to it in a minute.

What are some risks about bitcoin, where people could get hurt? Well, people could get scammed or stolen from. Wouldn't it be nice if companies that dealt with other peoples bitcoins were *required* to live up to a certain level of security? As little as requiring them to encrypt their usernames and passwords on their database would go a long way. That's a regulation. How about making them use HTTPS for anything involving bitcoin transactions or user data? That would be a regulation too. Or protecting against scams by requiring the owner of the company to publish his real identity? These can be good things. Now you might say: Only an idiot would trust his money to someone anonymous and use insecure sites to handle their money. But it's often very hard to figure out how secure the database of a website is. You'd have to have to be a White Hat yourself and probe it to find out first-hand exactly how secure it is. 

But more importantly, that's who regulations are (or should be) designed to protect. The idiots. Or more precisely, the ignorant. Without regulations, people will be scammed and stolen from, and the ignorant are the most vulnerable. And if the ignorant are duped and robbed every day, they're a hell of a lot less likely to want to use bitcoins. And most people are ignorant about these things. &gt;99% of people have wide gaps in their internet security knowledge. A good portion of the population is also susceptible to scams like pyramid schemes, which are already prevalent among bitcoins. If you want mass acceptance, you need to be willing to help protect the masses by following regulations.

And don't pretend that none of you can be ignorant either. I saw a survey conducted here a week or two ago that ~20% of you reported you lost bitcoins to theft, and ~20% of you reported that you'd lost bitcoins to your own mistakes. And we're very very far from the most ignorant people who are going to use bitcoins.

Back to murder, tax evasion, and dumping. I know what you were thinking. Murder and dumping don't have anything to do with monetary regulation. And taxes are bad anyway, so who cares about them. If you actually do think taxes are bad, shame on you. Without taxes we'd have no public roads, public education, or public police. Privatize them? Well, I'm not 100% sure on roads and education, but I *know* that privatized police will not make you happy. The rich running around with their very own little army? Do you want to go back into the feudal age? They won't have to steal your money through banks and the Fed, they can tax you much more directly. You'll be [this guy](http://xkcd.com/538/). That's world that's inevitable if you can't regulate bitcoin well enough to stop most tax evasion and keep governments afloat. That's a world nobody wants to live in, not even the rich.

But will regulations actually work? Are they even possible to enforce? And what regulations are the good ones? Those are hard questions. I don't know the answers, but I hope regulations that work do come. Because the possibility that they don't is very scary. Because while poor and lacking regulations could hamper the growth of bitcoin, I don't see them succeeding at stopping it.

So hopefully you realize that regulations are necessary. And if done right they are a good thing. If you used to think: *Regulations? Not today, not ever*, stop it. A world without regulations is a scary place that you don't want to live in.",cryptocurrency,1406826249

personalfinance,Question about Mutual Funds,"Hello there.  Just to describe my financial situation first.  I'm 27 and a Federal employee (my retirement goes to TSP and my wife has a 401k).  My wife and I combine for approximately $130K a year and we don't have any debt.  We rent and set aside as much as we can to a savings account for a down payment on a condo later down the road.

I don't have the slightest idea about investing but I just know it's a good thing.  I'm not interested in high-risk stocks and like the idea of mutual funds.  One good problem I have is that I have an extra $5k that I forgot about in an American Funds account that my dad set up for me when I was younger.  I've had the account since 2003 and started with $1800.  So essentially, I think I have 2 retirement accounts, one with TSP and another with American Funds.  What is your suggestion I do with that $5K?  I see it as my ""starter"" money for a good investment.  Should I keep it in American Funds, or move it to Vanguard?  Or should I take it and put it on a CD?  Or take the money and rollover to my TSP, which is my primary retirement fund (if I can even do that)?

Suggestions welcome.  I'm pretty open to anything and want to use this money as a nice gift to my wife and I 15 or 20 years down the road.  But it's fine if there are no other feasible options out there and I should just move it to TSP (again, if that's possible).",finance,1406833942

ethereum,Executing contracts / Ether volitility,"I'm trying to wrap my head around how services and contracts will be affected when the value of Ether becomes subject to market volatility.

&gt;&gt; Every time you send a transaction to a contract, it executes its code, which can store data, send transactions and interact with other contracts

Here are the two problems I'm struggling with:

1) There are set fees to run computational steps.  

In Bitcoin, the only computational step fee is the optional transaction fee for miners.  As BTC appreciated, the suggested fee went from .01 BTC to .0001 BTC (and now they are talking about variable fees).  In Ethereum, there are many more fees that will need to be adjusted if Ether is to appreciate in value.

2) Developers that create services/DAOs, will base their fees in Ether.  

It's pretty challenging to offer a service that has a fee constantly changing in relation to the provider/customer's local currency. I was thinking maybe a price could update at the time of purchase (i.e. Bitpay), but contracts can't call outside APIs because they are non-deterministic.

I did read (if I understood correctly) that contracts can be fed information by referring to newly created sub-contracts.  But this seem to invalidate the idea of a trustlessness.

I was thinking about taking out a private student loan for the $1775 but I found out the school has a payment plan that I can do for the $1775. It's 3 payments and it charges a $100 fee for any balance over $500. I have a $1000 to put towards one of the loans/payment plan.

If I do the payment plan through the school on the $1775, the $100 fee only works out to be a one time 5.6% fee and then paying it off over their 3 month repayment plan ($625 a month). So I was thinking of putting the $1000 on the parent plus loan and paying the $625 for 3 months and then putting an additional 300 a month on the parent plus loan for the 3 months then pay it off in the 4th month.

Cash on hand to make a payment: $1000

Can put $1000 a month towards payments

The reason I know all of this is because we recently moved in together (we've been dating for over 3 years), and we have been casually discussing our finances with each other, for obvious reasons....

I suggested to her that she takes her ~$25,000 in cash, and uses at least $20,000 of it to pay off her loans (starting with the highest interest loans).  She says she would not be comfortable with that, because ""What if she loses her job?""  I explained that I live with her, we've been together for 3 years, and I do not intend to hang her out to dry if she loses her job... I AM HER EMERGENCY FUND!  I have over $60,000 in easily liquidated investment, not to mention a $17,000 ""Emergency Fund"" of my own...

Given all of the above, I think it's just dang silly for her to keep her debt so high when she has the liquidity to pay a SIGNIFICANT portion of it off.  

Am I right?  Is it dumb for her to unnecessarily accumulate huge interest payments that could easily be avoided?  If so, how can I convince her to take my advice without ""talking down"" to her, given she is not very investment/finance-savvy at all.

Is she right?  Would it be too risky for her to use all of her personal ""emergency"" savings to pay them off?

personalfinance,Is standard repayment on student loans my best option?,"Hello PF,

I have a little over $50K in student loan debt with interest rates between 3% and 8% spread between different accounts.
1.) $24.5K in federal loans (3.4%-6.8%)
2.) $12.5K in private loans (8%)
3.) $14K in private PLUS loans that my mom took out, which I agreed to repay (8%)

I have been in standard repayment for items 1 and 2 for 20 months now, so I am 1/6th of the way to having them paid off.  Line 3 however is still in deferment because my mom is in nursing school and the loans are in her name (parent PLUS loans).  

Is standard repayment my best option?  I know there are ways to lower my monthly payments by extending them to 20+ year loans, loan forgiveness after 20 years, income based payments, etc..  I really don't like the idea of being in a 20 year note, but if it makes sense and there some good reasons to do so, I am all ears.

The other thing is.. I don't know how much longer I would qualify for income based payments, I make $60K now and will be making closer to $65K within the next year.  My GF and I have talked about getting hitched in the next 2 or 3 years which would bring our combined income into the $140K (at least) range before taxes.

I see people with more student loans debt (90k+) getting recommendations to consolidate and/or apply for income based repayment, so it got me wondering if standard repay is the right move for me.

Stan and Stella are superhot for each other, but they also fight like nobody's business. Blanche has no credit, expects royal treatment, lives entirely in her glamorous past, and is widely considered insane.

Blanche mercilessly insults Stan even while she lives on his dime. Stan can and will slap Blanche and all of her nonsense down, but that would put Stella in an awkward position since they're blue-blooded sisters whose names both begin and end in 'A', as should their reputation, and who in a perfect world would be above all this trifle. Plus, given Blanche's volatile history, she could really create a mess for everyone.

Stan knows a guy from work named Mitch, who recently has been struggling because he doesn't have the cojones of a Stan.  But he's the Everyman, the kind of guy we would trust our pensions with.  Mitch is intrigued by Blanche because she's pretty and shows him just the kind of interest and willingness to yield that he craves at the very depth of his soul.  He conjectures that her eccentricities are what keep her available, and since he is so charmed by them, he begins to wonder if they were made for each other.

But Stan and Mitch look into Blanche's past, and it's too ugly for there to be any real future.  Still, a kind of logic compels Mitch to hit-n-quit Blanche, as her current situation is forcing her to widen her spread, why shouldn't he get some instant gratification before that tantalizing spread closes?  But it's apparent he's seen this before, took the bite, and got burned bad.  Mitch comes to his senses and flees.

The Mitch situation brings the tensions in Stella's home to a boil. It's bad enough for the neighbors to voice their displeasure at all the commotion. Stella gets so fed up with Stan's cruelty and arrogance that she threatens to abandon him. Suddenly realizing just how dependent he is on Stella, Stan drops to his knees and proves absolutely irresistible because he 'makes it rain'. They have a baby.
