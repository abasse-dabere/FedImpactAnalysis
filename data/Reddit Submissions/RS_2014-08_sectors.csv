personalfinance,Private student loan or credit card???,I need to come up with $1690 in two weeks for tuition before I can go back for my last semester of college. I have maxed out my Federal Loans so that's a no go and no one I know can just lend me the extra dough. Basically I have to borrow the money. My question is should I look into taking out a private loan or would it be better to use my credit card which has enough room on it?,finance,1406851537
personalfinance,Just graduated from college and working full time. What should I be doing to set my self up for financial success?,"Not sure what kind of information would be helpful to answer the question but here are some basics:

I'm 23, I just graduated from college with my Bachelor's degree in December 2013. I'm living in Los Angeles working full-time(approx. 50 hours per week) making $12 an hour w/full benefits. I'm at a really fantastic company that I'm working my way up in, currently the receptionist but I'm 90% sure I'll be in a higher paying salaried role by the end of the year.

I don't have any car payments, but I'm probably about a year away from needed an upgrade. I pay $40 per month for car insurance and $35 per month for my cell. I spend $600 a month on rent, and $50 max for utilities. I don't buy groceries because I get fed 3 meals per day at work and I eat leftovers or occasionally go out on weekends. I spend about $150-200 per month in gas. I have to start making student loan payments next month($40,000 in loans total). I have about $4,000 extra that I keep in my checking account, but I don't really have savings.

I'm really good with my spending habits but I feel like I don't really know what to do to set myself up for financial success. I don't keep a budget but I also rarely spend on things I don't need. What should I be doing at this age/stage of life? 

Any/all advice is greatly appreciated :D",finance,1406852117

I'll be attending graduate school in the Fall, woohoo!
I qualify for a federal unsubsidized loan (6.21% interest) that will cover $20,500, but will leave me with $8,000 to pay. I can use a federal PLUS loan to cover the balance at 7.21% interest or pay up front.

personalfinance,Just won $26000. What do I do?,"So my friends and I(18) just went on vacation to Montreal and we went to a casino. I had $400 when I went in and after playing blackjack for what seems like an eternity I walked out with $26000. I am going to university this fall and have already received my funding from OSAP. The way this loan works is 0% interest for while I'm in university and 6 months after. After 6 months there is a low interest rate on it. I don't really want to use the money to pay off university fees but I guess it's the responsible thing to do. At the end of my university program I will be about $36000 in debt. So what's the best thing I should do with the $26000? 

I also have a job in the summer from my uncle which pays about $18000 cash/year but I'll probably use a chunk of that for living expenses.

news,A simple approach to finance for owning a dream car with car loans,"Finally, when it comes to apply for the finance or loans the interest loads our pocket. It too bears upon our monthly savings as well. This often puts a burden along the shoulders of the applier long procedure and heavy paper work is directed to obtain a loan these days. For those masses who are self-employed, lenders have finally realized the deficit in this area and they have truly worked hard to unfold up the marketplace for this group of people. We have the idea about this concept that not all the borrower’s fit into the area of the financial institutions or lenders because the interest rate really affects the soul. Small business owners don’t have the criteria to lend up the money in the marketplace. That’s why we are here to specialize in the field of lending the loan at lower and cheaper rates.
In fact, we will recommend discussing you your birth with your tax professional or attorney. Leasing is a well-known method of improving cash flow management and keeping up your cash for your core job or for projects offering better returns on capital. Hire purchase options are available and function in a similar fashion to car loans to purchase an asset. However, to simplify your decision process, we delineate the choices available to you. In order to decide on the most appropriate type of finance you first want to determine whether you wish to own the asset at the rest of the rental period?
Ace of the Directors of the company must be a property owner. Perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of being self-employed is when it comes to obtaining finance. Whenever it comes obtaining a loan it requires fewer documentation lies within you. On the other hand the crucial aspect is your physical condition as well.
At the present time, there’re many car loan companies ready to make you a loan. You can select either a secured or an unsecured loan and both car loans have their cons and pros. These car loans generally begin the type of unsecured loans, though buying a car can also be made by a secured loan. In a secured loan, you’ll be secured on your home and therefore the result you’ll find a low interest rate on loan. 
Other folks do not have a house or assets to utilize for security, therefore for such type of people, an unsecured loan for a car is truly the only choice. Another benefit of an unsecured loan for the car is that the loan procedure usually can be finished more rapidly than a secured loan of the car. In reality, car loans are created for everyone who doesn’t have the earning documentation to support a conventional loan application. For several years, these folks experienced major difficulty when it arrived to find finance, as they’re in a condition where they’ve trouble showing proof of a long term and stable personal money flow.

personalfinance,"Student loans pay off plan: Lowest loan balance, or highest interest rate?","Ok, I honestly dont have that much in student loans, only about $8000. I was fortunate to go to college where my mom was teaching and I got a pretty decent tuition break. I was dumb though.  No one fully explained the seriousness of defaulting, so I let them go. I have worked really hard the past 10 months and am FINALLY out of default, but need some advice on a repayment plan to get them taken care of as quickly as possible. 

I have 4 ""groups"" each with a different interest rate. 

Group A: $ 3,307 at 5.75%
Group B: $ 1,468 at 4.25%
Group C: $ 897 at 3.15%
Group D: $ 2,371 at 6.55%

My game plan was to pay off the lowest loan, Group C, and get it out of the way. Since it really is pretty low I thought that was pretty manageable and I would be down to 3 loans. After accessing the website though,  and seeing that Group D's interest rate is double that of C, I started to second guess the plan. 

I currently pay $100/mo that applies to all as the minimum payment, and planned on paying an extra $100/mo toward Group C to get it gone in hopefully 6 months and move on to the next (at that point, the highest interest rate.)

personalfinance,Is this a good short term plan to meet long term goals?,"Long time lurker first time post. 

In this case:
Short term ~ 1-2 years
Long term ~ 3-5 years


I'll give you a little background and try to make it short. My wife and I ultimately are trying to save 20% down to purchase a house for our family. We only have one car loan (~$10,000) and two student loans ($10,000 and $6,000). We only plan to pay off the car before we buy a house because the interest rates on the loans are low. We will pay them off first when we move. We would have taken care of all our debt right when we got married but we got pregnant and we decided to put it off so my wife could stay home. She is currently looking for a full-time job which would greatly speed up our plan. She is not rushing to find a job, so we don't know exactly when that will happen. So below is figured on just my income. 


We haven't been the best with our money up to this point. Having a kid makes things tight but we made it worse by not being frugal. Fourteen months after we had our daughter, we have finally paid off our medical bills. Once the dust settled we now have $500 in our emergency. Currently after all monthly expenses I have about $600 left over on the month. Before you guys ask, I am paying into my 401k as much as my employer will match but having a house is really important to us, so I am putting any thing else on hold until we get a house. 


Our car situation is the main thing that I need guidance on. I'll tell you what my current plan is and you guys feel free to tear holes in it. I have a paid off 2001 Camry with 230k miles on it. It has been really reliable and I feel like it could last another 2 years or so but in reality it could have issues at any time. So I feel as though I need money in the bank to replace it. I feel comfortable buying a car off craigslist for $5000, I can do most repairs myself and have always had used older cars. So rather than put our extra money onto the car loan, I am going to put it in the bank until the balance is $6000 ($1000 for emergency). At that point if my car is still running, I will buy another car and sell off the car we have a loan on and start working towards another $5000 to replace my car.


We need to keep two cars because while my wife doesn't work, she picks up our nephew from school two times a week. She also might be getting a full time job fairly soon, so she would need it to commute. The other car is an 08 Ford Edge. We only have about $500-1000 in equity in it according to KBB. 


Any other suggestions?


I know ideally we should just get $5000 in equity in our car first and then sell it. Then we could buy my wife a replacement and this would reduce the amount of interest we end up paying on the loan. The only reason that I don't want to do this is if my car ends up dying. Then we would only have $1000 liquid and we may end up having another car loan which I don't want to have. Also, when you buy a car you can get a way better deal with $5000 cash on craigslist than you can $5000 loan using a dealer.",finance,1406907620
personalfinance,Paying off promo period balance vs highest interest,"Alright, so I'm in debt repayment mode after screwing around with my finances.

I don't need the lecture on that. ;)

So, my question is - when you have a 0% promo period balance that is about to go to its regular interest rate, even if you could pay off the lower balance promo, it's best just to pay the higher rate, right?

Have a kid due in December. It was planned.  However, my wifes pay reduces to 60%.

Mortgage renews in a few months. Should I pull some of the equity out of the house, refinance to add 30k to the principal and use the cash to pay off the vehicle? Interest rates would drop significantly (I expect 2.7-2.75%. I would then take the balance and pay off the car, leaving us with only our routine monthly bills. If I refinance and add in the additional 30k for the vehicle, I would have a net savings of about 250/mo.

Of course, debt consolidation, bankruptcy, maybe calling my creditor's, seeing what my options are, etc come to mind.

I also have one more caveat. I should be able to collect unemployment, and some more school money is coming in (luckily my school is inexpensive, maybe 3000 semester), and I'm looking at lower interest $ from school loans that I don't have to pay on until I graduate.

Any advice?

*I did get laid off, I did it quietly and respectfully.*

Income now:

**Current cash** ($1700, $700 soon to be spent on mortgage).

VA disability ~130/mo

Expected capital:

School money is in the form of grants, looking at about 2000 extra free grant money, 
1500 3.5 deferred interest loan, and maybe another 1500 at 6.5 interested.

School loans are not due until I graduate in 2 years.

I applied for unemployment last week, I was told it was on good terms by corporate HQ.  

My pay was $17/hr, but... my hours varied.  On average, I would say between 28 and 36 hours per week.

My credit cards are probably between 2-5k a piece between maybe 4 cards, with a total of 10k. 

**Update 2**:

You guys are really helping me group think through a stressful and difficult situation, I really appreciate it.

So far I'm making a list of my cc's, and am going to call each one and ask about their insurance options.  I was afraid to ask them about this because it might set off red flags for them to monitor my account more closely and possibly become more bloodthirsty in attempting to track down late payments.

I'm thinking.  If I can maybe pay off one or two of those cards, but even if just one.  It would put a huge relief on me when unemployment starts (which hopefully should be soon, but who knows, I've never actually collected before, but I did file, but had to request a correction on the #'s inputted, which takes 7 to 10 days to respond.)

**Update 2.5**

I called one cc, who said I'd have to be actually late before they offer any type of plans?

**Update 3**:

I may have just secured a partnership of sorts with a friend of mine who owns his own business around the corner, might be able to do some semi-reliable tech related work.

**Update 4**

What's great about it, is I've done this profession since I was in the Service, so I have all the equipment (KVM's, switches, flash drives with diagnostic bootable tools, the whole nine yards).  

I can wait out my cc payments.  I should be able to start collecting my UI before any of them go past 30 days.  If that's the case, I can keep paying minimum payments until next time I get more school money, and then I should be able to clear them all out.  **I intend on funneling my extra grant money/loan money into my cc's to basically swap out the interest rates.**

I've always wanted to jump into it on my own and be my own boss; so I setup a partnership, so far the split is 60 (mine) / 40 (his) for letting me use his retail space free of charge, but he has high visibility, and I'm hoping that within 2-3 days I start to see my return on investment (I dropped $30 on 100 professional [custom made] business cards, and 100 flyer's).  **Thanks to this post, I already got contacted by two recruiters**, and my resume on monster as well as Dice is up to date to include this new venture so it doesn't even show any period of unemployment.

personalfinance,"Does it make sense to take small ""loans"" from our emergency fund to pay down student loan debt?","I am curious what you all think - long time lurker, haven't posted much.

We are a married mid-20's couple with a total balance of $32,000 in student loan debt. The interest rates are a mix of 4-6.5%.

We make about 104K pre-tax and are doing all the right things such as funding 401k/Roths and have a fully funded 6 month emergency fund at $16,000. This fund assumes we both lose our jobs and do not find low-wage temporary work until we can get back into professional work. I estimate it would realistically take over 1 year to fully deplete.

So, that said, I've been considering taking small ""loans"" from our EF to pay down debt in chunks and minimize what we pay to interest. For example, take $1000 from the EF to pay down principal on the student loans, and pay it back into the EF at a rate of $250 every 4 months. Similar mindset to a credit card balance transfer.

I am taking full advantage of the small amount of money my work puts into a 401(k). 

I have approximately 60k in federal student loans with a interest rate of approximately 6.8%. I am currently paying $10 a month on these loans because I have income-based repayment and this is our first year out of school. I don't know exactly how much next year's payments will be, but with 90k household income, I am sure it won't be $10 a month. 

Honestly, I have no clue whether I will work in the government for the 10 years necessary to have my student loans forgiven. I would put the chances at less than 50% but more than 25%. Should my wife and I prioritize paying off the 60k in loans, despite the possibility of loan forgiveness in 9 years, or do we invest elsewhere, and if so, what do we invest in? 

Another factor is that our income will most likely be significantly higher in 5-10 years than it is now (we are both attorneys and passed the bar in October of last year). 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1406921187
personalfinance,"$15,000 in cash to buy a car. Get an auto loan anyway to raise credit score?","23 years old &amp; I currently have $15,000 to buy a car. My current credit score is around 680 (according to Quizzle). I am considering taking out a loan in order to raise my credit score to ensure lower interest rates on bigger loans in the future. 

I was approved for a $15,000 loan with 4.99% APR. In addition, I was advised to take at least 2 years to pay off my loan if I wish to raise my credit score, which would raise my total cost to around $16,500 (if I pay it off in 2 years). I would also make a small amount of money in interest by keeping my cash in a savings account rather than paying for the car outright. 

Is the extra $1,500 worth it in order to raise my credit score? Thanks in advance for your advice!!",finance,1406922246

I recently got approved for my first high limit credit card ($16k). I'm married and my wife has some high interest rate credit cards which are carrying significant balances. I just wanted to make sure that what I'm planning makes sense. I think it does, but I know there are people on here smarter than I am when it comes to money.

Her cards, balance, and (transfer fee)

-$1500 @ 21.24% ($45)

-$2000 @ 23.99% ($60)

-$3400 @ 25.14% ($102)

-$5000 @ 19.99% ($150)

With my new card, I have 0% interest until October 2015 and a 3% (or $200, whichever is cheaper) fee on balance transfers. After the introductory period, it will be a 12.9% APR.

I'm a student and will be graduating in May with a degree that promises $100-120k a year. I just wanted to make sure that it makes sense to transfer these balances to my new card. I know my credit is going to take a big HUGE hit as a result, but it will save us money in the long run, I think. Any opinions and advice are welcome and appreciated.",finance,1406934467

worldpolitics,The case for the partial blockade,"Why it won't get lifted...

**Part 1: Withdrawal '05**

As the Second Intifada wrapped up, when thousands of Palestinians and Israelis died, and suicide bombings were a common occurrence (the vast majority perpetrated by Hamas), Israel decided that it was too much of a headache to continue occupying the Gaza Strip (GS). Israel also figured it was too impractical to protect the ~10k Israeli-Gazan citizens once the IDF withdrew, and so they evicted them. In addition, Israel had begun building the wall that runs along the outside of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank (WB), which may have had the effect of dramatically reducing the incidence of suicide bombings in Israel.

Israel unilaterally withdrew from the GS in '05, finishing the process by September. Israel maintained security oversight (not a blockade) of the maritime border from a considerable distance out from the shore (not sure of the number, but probably 6 or 12 miles out), and maintained the security on their side of the Israeli-GS border. Egypt was left to maintain the security on their side of the Egyptian-GS border. A plan was implemented in which GS would eventually be allowed to build an airport and seaport, and be given more and more autonomy over time, but events unfolded immediately after the withdrawal which has delayed those plans indefinitely.

With the IDF no longer monitoring and suppressing militant activity in the GS, securing the Israeli-Egyptian border, nor actively monitoring maritime traffic loads, Hamas and other militants thrived. The Palestinian National Security Forces (PNSF) were not up to the task of maintaining the security of the border, and weapons flooded in from Egypt and the coast. On numerous occasions, the PNSF and militants clashed violently, causing deaths. During this period, rocket attacks from the GS escalated 5-fold.

---

**Part 2: Legislative Election '06**

The Palestinian legislative election was then held January '06, and, partly due to allegations (probably true) of corruption against the Fatah, Hamas won a decisive victory. No sense of irony should be lost that Hamas won an election over corruption charges. This did not cause a decrease in attacks against Israel originating from the GS, but instead, it escalated it even further.

One way to look at it, Hamas won the ""house"", but the Fatah still had control of the civil and state (Palestinian National Authority, or PNA) through the President, and the PLO. The PLO is the organization that deals with Israel during the peace process, and represents the Palestinian people on an international level. The PLO is made up or controlled by primarily the Fatah, since they were the founders and legitimizers of it.

The Fatah, through Abbas, still maintained control of the PNSF, which was hopelessly trying to enforce border security in the GS against militant activity. Clashes between the PNSF and Fatah, with Hamas and other militant groups, continued unabated.

---

**Part 3: The Quartet's 3 Demands '06**

It was following the Hamas legislative election victory that the Quartet, along with Israel, imposed economic sanctions which prevented aid and funding from ending up in the hands of PNA. The PNA had now become officially tied with the Hamas organization on a ""federal"" level. In order to get the sanctions lifted, the Quartet and Israel told Hamas it had to agree to 3 demands, which would elevate itself to the level that Fatah was already committed to in the peace process.

**Renunciation of violence**

This means Hamas should not be importing weapons that have since been used exclusively to target Israeli civilians. Not digging tunnels into Israeli territory for the purposes of kidnapping Israelis, or attack Israeli border towns. Accepting that they'll likely lose $100Ms of funding per year from anti-Israeli forces participating in the Israeli-Arab conflict (ahem Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah, Iran, etc...). In addition, they need to clamp down on Egyptian tunnels that are used to smuggle weapons and rockets into the GS.

**Recognition of Israel**

Hamas has to be willing to work with Israel in a diplomatic fashion after the creation of a Palestinian state, and during the peace negotiations. It also means that after the implementation of a 2 state solution, they will recognize their border with Israel.

**Acceptance of previous agreements between Israel and the PLO**

Hamas needs to agree to be on the same page in the peace process as their WB partners. Getting Palestinians and Israeli negotiators to the point where they were at took years and years of negotiating and soul-searching. Hamas needs to work with the Fatah to help finalize those negotiations once and for all, and not make dated and/or unrealistic demands that had already been worked through. A 2 state solution cannot be implemented with only 1 of the 2 occupied territories participating in the process.

---

**Part 4: Hamas' rejection of the Quartet's demands and their illegal seizure of control over the Gaza Strip in '06-'07**

Unfortunately, the sanctions weren't good enough to persuade Hamas to meet those 3 conditions, because, with Hamas' legislative victory, funding from Arab countries, mostly Iran, had skyrocketed. Hamas was netting $100s millions from the Iranian government, counteracting the economic sanctions. After that initial burst of funding, Iran would later maintain a steady flow of about $20 million per month into Hamas' coffers.

Fearing the growing influence and control that Hamas had over the GS, and feeling the pressure from the economic sanctions due to having lost control of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) to Hamas, the Fatah then tried to form a Unity Government with Hamas. This move would have shared the state powers of the PNA between the Fatah and Hamas, a big deal. It was like giving Hamas a general election victory that they would share with the Fatah. Fatah's hope was that by sharing such powers with Hamas, it would discourage any desire by Hamas to form their own political and military system in the GS. The catch? Hamas needed to recognize the demands of the Quartet otherwise the Fatah was giving up significant executive power, including sole power over the PNSF, without getting the economic sanctions lifted off the PNA.

During this time, rocket attacks continued to escalate, especially in response to the economic sanctions, and Hamas even orchestrated a cross-border raid into Israel and kidnapped Shalit. Relations between Israel and Hamas reached a new low.

When it became clear to the Fatah that they were eventually going to lose all control over the GS, they, along with some support from the West, tried to re-assert their constitutional powers over the GS. It escalated into a power struggle that descended into a violent conflict called the Hamas-Fatah war in '07. Hamas won the battle decisively, ousting the Fatah and PNSF from GS. Once the connection between Hamas and the PNA had been severed, economic sanctions on the PNA (and Fatah) were lifted. Restrictions on giving aid or funding to Hamas still remained, since Hamas was still a terrorist designated organization. However, that didn't stop foreign anti-Hamas parties from bribing Hamas or funneling aid to desperate Gazans (which can be intercepted by Hamas).

---

**Part 5: Implementation of the partial blockade, focused primarily on limiting Hamas' military capacity**

It was after the Hamas-Fatah War that the partial blockade was implemented, because there was no entity left in the GS that Israel recognized to be legitimately part of the PLO or PNA, and the PNSF were no longer enforcing the border. The GS had been effectively annexed by anti-Israeli factions of the Middle East. From any reasonable perspective, the GS was no longer under the authority or protection of the PNA or PLO, which are the internationally recognized organizations that represent the Palestinian territories and Palestinian people.

The partial blockade was implemented as a response to the continued and escalating violence, and was also a result of both the continued non-recognition of Israel by Hamas, which had already been established with the PLO since '93, and non-recognition of prior agreements between Israel and the PLO during the peace process.

Israel is not going to lift the partial blockade in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. Not only is the ceasefire temporary, while lifting the partial blockade would be a permanent concession, but there are also the unwritten limitations Hamas imposes upon Israel during any ceasefire:

* Continued building of tunnels into Israel, and the continued existence of tunnels that are already deep inside of Israel *(Currently, Hamas wants to impose a ceasefire, or long-term truce, with Israel even though illegal tunnels into Israel would still exist)*

* Israel is not allowed to defend the integrity of their border from any intrusions *(Past ceasefires that Hamas blames Israel for violating generally revolve around activity relating to Israel's defense of the integrity of the partial blockade, which had never been lifted in a ceasefire agreement to begin with)*

* Israel is not allowed to retaliate against any militant activity originating from the GS, from Hamas or not *(Past ceasefires that Hamas blames Israel for violating have also revolved around counter-attacks to the continued rocket attacks from the GS that are always occurring regardless of the ceasefire)*

* Israel is not allowed to take any military action in the WB against Hamas, or Palestinians, even though past and present ceasefire agreements were and are specific to the GS

* Once the ceasefire period officially ends, if it ever makes it that long, Hamas would be free to resume militant activities in order to extract further concessions from Israel without making any concessions of their own towards meeting the 3 demands of the Quartet",cryptocurrency,1406960558
personalfinance,$130k Student Loan vs. Roth Ira Contributions,"Situation:

My fiance has $130,000 in student loan debt I am inheriting.  Interest rate is 6.4%.  I am maxing out my 401k submission.  When she finishes wrapping up her masters degree we will have a household income in the range of $120,000 before tax.  We both see ourselves with much higher paying positions in the future, so we decided a Roth IRA would be a better fit.

I am trying to wrap my head around the Roth IRA contributions vs. paying off the student debt faster.  My intuition says if I can get a higher interest rate on the Roth IRA I should go for that, but I'm having a hard time understanding the scale.  I made a spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cV8F8uDCm8eIRvu6By3WtRE8wp2d3W8cBPVHIhKopYE/pubhtml).

If we contribute $2000 per month it will take 6 years and 9 months to pay off the debt.  The total cost payments will be $160k.  If we contribute less the $450 Roth IRA contribution of $1550 per month it will take 9 years and 3 months to pay off the debt.  The total cost will be $173K.  So a $13,000 difference.

A Roth IRA of an assume 8% interest rate would be at $73K by the end of the 9 years and 3 months. (Please help me out if that is as crazy as it sounds).

One way I look at it I see I have just earned $60K (By paying 13K extra on the loan I now have $73K in an IRA).  On the other hand the Roth IRA would have only earned $23K in interest while I'm paying an extra $13k on the loans so I only made $10K.  Either way it seems like a good choice.

Please help me out if my projections look off, or if the 8% on the IRA seems high.  I want to make the best decision I can here for our future.  My future wife wants to pay off the loans ASAP, but I want to make sure we are being smart.",finance,1406964389

Bitcoin,Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation is preparing a legislative amendment to effectively ban any operations with cryptocurrencies!,"*Good news everyone:* According to Russian law it's forbidden to issue any sort of money substitutes that is not issued by the Central Bank.
Yet it's not clearly defined by the law what is the money substitutes at the moment.

Ministry of Finance suggest to clarify that, including digital currencies in that list, banning any operations with them, including possible restrictions to use substitutes as a form of payment for the goods, to exchange them for Rubles or any other foreign currency.

On top of that Ministry of Finance suggest to add administrative and/or criminal responsibility for issuing a money substitutes and doing any sort of operations with them. Also (as a popular trend these days) they suggest to restrict access to websites that provide information on money substitutes.

National authorities unable to control digital currencies attracts shadow economy players.
Thanks to the anonymity of the owners of digital currencies, they gained popularity as a method to purchase illegal goods, money laundering and other sorts of criminal activity. - clarifies Ministry. 

Therefore Ministry suggest to impose a ban for issuing any sort of money substitutes including their digital forms.
It is also proposed to clarify laws of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, extending a ban not only on the issue of money substitutes, but also to conduct any operations with them. 

**Specific proposals of the Ministry of Finance has not yet announced** but the notice of the development of appropriate federal law has been published on a government portal for posting information about the draft laws.

personalfinance,What should I do with my unused credit cards?,"I have 5 credit cards that I finished paying off about a month ago. 2 are Cap1 each with $500 limits, 2 are Chase with $2500 limits, and 1 is Citizen's Bank with a $2500 limit. I also have a PayPal buyer credit account with a $1000 limit and a Kohl's card with $1500 limit; I'm including these because they're essentially credit cards as well. 

These accounts range from about 6-12 years old and have high interest rates. I don't intend to use them to carry debt ever again but I am working towards buying a house as soon as a year from now and I don't want this open credit to affect my ability to do so. 

Seems I have a couple options:

I can use the cards for general expenses and pay them off before interest is accrued each month to keep the accounts active. I'm responsible enough to manage this without incurring more debt (I was in a really bad place before and made poor decisions but turned around and have no debt, not even a cell phone contract, and am growing my savings). 

Other option would be to have some or all of the accounts closed. I have read that this can be bad for my credit rating so I'm hesitant to do so, but I also think I have too many accounts and I could potentially benefit from closing some. 

I could also do a combination of both options of course, or perhaps there are some other suggestions. Any advice is truly appreciated.",finance,1406988168

personalfinance,Is our mortgage rate too high?,"Family $131,500 in household income. Credit rating 783 and 754. 

Five debts; home $136,000 at 6.8%, two new cars $37,000 total at 3%, one credit card $7000 at 0% (home improvements with payoff schedule 18 months no interest).  We refinanced the house once to payoff repairs, so the balance went back up.

Six assets; home $160,000, car one $22,000, car two $20,000, car three $6,000 (kid), cash savings $13,000, 5% of income into retirement accounts we pretend don't exist so they are never touched. 

We've been in the home for years, the value dropped after purchase and never recovered.  Meanwhile we've poured funds into extensive repairs, its old and has poor drainage damage. We wanted to refinance the house again as our most expensive debt, and the rate was quoted at 7.3%.  Other than the cars (debt and value seem to be decline at the same rate currently) for our long daily commutes (no public transportation available), I don't see why we are getting hit with such high mortgage rates - what are we doing wrong? 

 I won't leverage retirement or savings on the house, feels risky. We could move toward the city get higher milage cars, but home values closer to work skyrocket, our house would be $3000,000 there.  A new house MIGHT (the devil you know versus the devil you don't) eliminate the huge repairs we seem to face so we could put those funds toward the balance,  but again a new house would cost more.

- ~ 35,000 private at 10%

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on choosing between my cash balance plan, or a new 401k plan","Hello wise people of personal finance. Thanks for taking time to read my first post. 
Curently I am a 2.5 year employee of a large company in an entry level position. 

When I started, our retirement structure was as follows. New employees had two retirement benefits.
1. A 401k that matches up to 4.5 % , 75 cents to the dollar (meaning 6% must be contributed to get max contributions).
2. We also got a cash balance pension plan that contributes 6% monthly salary, along with interest credits at the rate of 6-9% depending on what the pension board sets the interest rates that year. Basically, they take whatever the interest rate is at the start of the year and divide it by 12. Each month, 6% of monthly salary is added to the account and the total balance of the account is multiplied by the fractional interest rate and credited for interest. 

Now, to someone who doesn't know that much about finance or retirement (me) this sounds pretty sweet. But, they recently did away with the cash balance plan for new employees hired this year in favor of a better 401k plan and I want to know whether I should consider opting into the new plan while sacrificing my pension.

The new plan is a 401k which matches up to 4.5% 75 cents on the dollar, plus the company kicks in a base 4.5% of your salary regardless of your contributions. So if I kick in the minimum 6%, plus 9% from the company. I already contribute 10% of my own salary to my existing 401k and was thinking about increasing my contributions even more... 
Other factors
1. I'm 27 years old and have only had a 401k for about 2.5 years
2. Current salary is 58k 
3. 401k balance is 17k ( I just started contributing 10% after only kicking the minimum for 2 years. 

Any advice or consideration would be greatly appreciated.

solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work. (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it may have other flaws.)

( ) Jews have lived as minorities elsewhere, and it hasn't always worked out well  
( ) Israeli Jews do not want to emigrate en masse to the countries their grandparents came from  
( ) Palestinians do not want to emigrate en masse to Jordan  
( ) Binational states do not have a good track record  
( ) Egypt does not want to be held responsible for the behaviour of Hamas in Gaza  
( ) Surrounding countries have no interest in settling large numbers of foreigners  
( ) Suffering tends to harden Jewish resolve, not weaken it  
( ) Suffering tends to harden Arab resolve, not weaken it  
( ) Neither Palestinians nor Jews identify as ""Canaanite""  
( ) Israel is not geographically in Europe  
( ) The European Union doesn't want to allow citizenship to all the Jews in the world

( ) Israeli contentment with the status quo  
( ) Israel's conventional military superiority  
( ) American sympathy for Israel  
( ) Israel's nuclear weapons  
( ) The long-term inevitability of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons

Taking bids on the machine, will sell to highest bidder! Price new was $5000 and it was a 3 month waiting time to get it delivered. If you buy it from me, you will have it sent straight away with FedEx or any other courier you wish to use.
It is possible to do escrow on the deal as well.

personalfinance,"Today I found a nice way to insure my personal liabilities, consolidate expenses while saving money. Also why I'll never take a loan from a dealership again (CA)","Straight to the chase -- my wife and I have a truck loan through a dealership here in Alberta. I own a construction company, consisting of just me, my truck and my tools. The truck recently decided it was gonna start breaking down on me, and since it needs some minor bodywork I figured I'd approach the bank about a small loan to get it all done at once rather than saving for 3-4 mos. to get the cash together. I have a good credit rating, so I figured that shouldn't be a problem to get a $5K loan. 

I go in and ask for a $5k loan at the minimum. Turns out they can approve me for a fully insured $25,000 loan at prime +4%, which is a lower interest rate than I was getting from the dealer. I ain't a rich guy, my business isn't really especially successful, so this was a nice surprise. I can pay out my truck loan ($18k), which is great for my credit score, get a ton of work done on it ($6k) and have about a grand left over for investment capital, with LOWER monthly payments than I had from my original truck loan. I estimate to save about $1500. The loan is also open-ended, so I can put down an extra $100 a month and pay off the loan a year early.

The best part? 100% of the loan is fully insured in case of death or disability. At a cost of ~$500. I have a high likelihood of injuring myself at some point, so this is a wonderful thing to have.

I understand that this is probably old news to some, and might not be that exciting. I was just amazed at how easy it was to consolidate my expenses, insure my loan and get some good investment capital for my company. My dealer loan was not a good deal, and I wish I had seen it earlier. I'm not a huge fan of banks but I couldn't be happier with mine right about now.

personalfinance,Are we on the right track for a great mortgage rate?,"Thanks ahead of time for reading this novel. A little background: My husband's credit score is 699 and mine is 656. We have **no**  foreclosures, bankruptcy, judgements, collections, etc. He only has about a 2 year average on his credit history, whereas mine is a 6 year average. I guess the low scores are mostly due to length of history? 

The only thing really negative to report would be 4 missed payments on a Gap card, and 2 missed payments on a Premier card. they were only about 30 days late and were spaced out over a year and a half. I closed the cards about 2 years ago, since I kept forgetting to pay them off, this was before I realized that closing a credit line was bad. All my other accounts are 100% paid on time. My husband has 0 late payments.

We're hoping to upgrade to a larger home in about 5 years, so I'm trying to work on our credit now so we can get the absolute best interest rate. I'm shooting for prime here. Would this be a seemingly reasonable goal to achieve say 760-800 in this time frame? The steps we've taken so far is getting each of us a new credit card to manage. He has the Chase Sapphire and I have the Discover It. I brought up the idea on having at least 2 credit cards each, but he is very hesitant about opening up any  more lines of credit. Previous to these cards, I just have my student loans that I'm faithfully paying on, and he has a personal loan. Would this be enough?

Lastly, my oldest account is a student loan. It's down to $315 and will be paid off very soon, will this also affect my score a lot since the other loans are relatively much younger or would it be negligible?

I moved back to Canada this year after living in the US for almost ten years. I left when I was in my early twenties and didn't pay much attention to credit ratings. I did in the US as we owned a home, and my credit score there was 790. 

Anyways, I checked my score here and there is nothing listed whatsoever beside the cell phone company I use now (perfect standing). There's no debt, not a thing else listed, and my score is at 594.

So, I went to my bank (newly opened this year), and asked them to open a secured card, so I could build a credit history. They explained they didn't sell prepaid cards and were confused. I asked around and apparently there are no secured cards here. Well!

I decided to go open a card at a department store then and just suffer the interest rate and make a minimum purchase once per month, however they need a credit card in the first place but I don't have one yet.

I do not have a credit card with my bank because I am not employed as I am supported by another person (pregnant and we don't want to buy another car/he doesn't mind me being home for the next year). I barely use the account at all, I keep a few hundred in savings and pay two of my personal bills through checking (he gives me cash or I do cash jobs here and there like yardwork/sitting). I checked the rates through my bank and they are 18.99% and up.

All the bills are in his name and he pays for whatever I need. I had a rental lease from the fall that I paid myself, but that doesn't show up. Internet through Bell is in my name but they explained they do not submit anything to credit history. 

I am unsure what to do next to build credit. I am starting up my own at-home business this fall to bring in income and keep myself productive, and will need a credit history/credit card.

 -is this an effective way of building credit? (currently 22 with a score of 666)
 -will it hurt my credit at all by paying off line of credit within the same day?

personalfinance,I feel like there is a huge market for teaching personal finance to college students and other young adults.,"Just from reading this sub, churning, and financial discussions with young coworkers, I feel like the financial literacy of youth is incredibly poor. I believe part of this is because even if high schools do teach it, students can't relate at the time because they generally don't have to worry about paying bills, using credit cards, dealing with loans, or making investment decisions. Then the real world can be a rude awakening, and since many go off to college they don't have a parent present to teach them how to effectively manage money, nor do many want their input anyways. Personal financial advisers are fairly inaccessible as well because they primarily make their money off of a percentage of assets in an account, so if you have little to no money to open an account they won't give you the time of day.

That being said, I'm thinking about starting my own basic financial consulting side business to educate young people on what to do and what not to do to establish good credit and put themselves in a position to succeed financially. I, myself, am 24 and feel since I'm close to to my target market's age, they would be more willing to pay me for help and more likely to take my advice.

personalfinance,23 y/o Male recent grad would like some input,"Hello everyone! I feel like I am on the right track with finances, but I would like to run it by others as well.

First off, my debts are:

Student loans:

$1795 @ 8% (Originally was $2900)

$5140 @ 3.25%

Federal loans are:
Sub $3500 @ 4.5%


Unsub $7500 @ 3.86%

Unsub $16000 @ 6.8%

Plus approx. $2500 in interest currently

Car loan:
$15300 @ 1.74% (6 years)

My monthly expenses are:

Rent: $475

Car payment: $227

Car insurance: $123

Phone: $45

Internet: $60

Utilities: $50

Gas: $150

Federal loan minimum: $335

Groceries, eating out, ""fun"" expenses: $400 (This will most likely get cut down, I'm estimating currently until I have a baseline to compare to).

Savings: $500

Which leaves about $435 extra each month.

I have about $3200 in savings currently. After taxes, healthcare, and 401(k) I bring home about $2800 a month, with paychecks twice a month.

The loans do not enter repayment until November, but I have already started paying because I hate seeing the interest increase even more. Between signing bonus and a few other small windfalls(graduation), I will have the 8% loan paid off this month. I am unsure what the monthly minimum payment on the private loans will be, but I plan to pay either the minimum or $100 a month, whichever is higher.

With the leftover money I intend to use it on the federal loans until the $16000 loan is gone. Also, I have highballed a lot of my expenses. Which means currently I end up with a bit more extra each month than the budget says. For example utilities currently are only $7, but I imagine once winter hits it will go up a lot so I tried to average. 

There are a few major life events on the horizon, such as a potential move, engagement, etc. The move most likely won't happen for at least two years and I would try to work out some sort of relocation bonus into whatever job I may get by then.

Engagement is likely to happen within the next year, but that in itself won't be too expensive.

I personally feel like I'm on a good track, but again, it would be nice to have an outside party determine that as well. I think I covered all relevant information, but if not I can certainly add it in! Thank you all for the help!",finance,1407076944

Pay them off immediately, or use the money towards a down payment on a car that I will need to buy?","So, these items in collections are basically carry-over from a time when I was having serious financial problems. 2 years ago, I started a new job (making 3x what I was making previously), but have neglected those collections items to focus on other things (moving, student loans, and credit card debt). 

I have a 100% perfect payment history with 2 student loans and keep my credit card utilization at a low percentage each month. I only have 1 CC - a secured Capital One card with a $750 limit. 

My credit score is only 598, and I am concerned about it because I need to buy a car in October when the inspection expires on my terminally ill hooptie. I can afford a car payment, but I don't want to get screwed on financing because of my low score. 

I have some cash saved up that I can use as a down payment on the car and will be able to pay off those collections items with next year's tax return. Basically, I am most concerned about my score since it will have an impact on my car loan. Will paying off those collections items ""look better"" and help me get a interest rate on the car, or will having more cash for a down payment keep my monthly car payments lower? (I will also have 2 months worth of pay-stubs to bring with me to the dealership).

I have always bought cheap ($2,000) used cars, and will be going to the dealership for the first time. I'm not 100% sure how my credit score will impact the experience, so I'm looking for some guidance.

Let me give you some info!
  
***

I'm 25 (US) and typically work on contract so I'm sporadically employed. When I am employed, I bring in around $2400/month (after taxes) but sometimes I can go a month (possibly more) without work because of the nature of my business. (I’m working on getting more consistent income, though.)

Budget:

 * Rent and utilities: ~$750
 * Groceries: $150
 * Gas: $120
 * Shopping/Eating Out: $50

The rest is dumped in savings ""just in case"" I'm unemployed for too long, except for...

My student loans!

 * Stafford Loans (now with Sallie Mae) $25,000 @ 5.5% This one is completely in my name!

 * Parent PLUS Loan (now with Great Lakes) $49,000 @ 7.75% This one is completely in my dad's name, but I am the one paying it.
*ALSO there's a $3000 wall of interest I still have to pay through until I hit the principal.*

I've mostly been making minimum payment on both loans (about $200 to Sallie Mae and $360 to Great Lakes) because I've been doing contract work and basically don't know when I could be unemployed for several months. I want to make bigger payments to pay these off faster, but I feel like I don't want to pay extra on the loans and be left with nothing for essentials if a contract falls through.

Don't get me wrong, my father is in his upper 50s and in okay health, and I love him to pieces. I would gladly pay 49K for him to stay alive any amount of time longer! But I'm not thinking he's going to be around for another decade or so (because of family health history). It's a bummer to think about, but in the event of his death, would the Parent PLUS loan be discharged, since it’s only in his name? Would my mom (his wife) be obligated to pay on it, since they’re married? I wanted to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first, but is it worth it to attack the PLUS loan headfirst if it would just be discharged in a few years with death? I don't want to ""count on"" death happening, but I guess I just want to be prepared...

In all this mess, I also want to set up a Roth IRA, as well as pay off these loans ASAP. I have about $6000 cash altogether right now!

personalfinance,Grandmother wants to put my mom on the deed to her house.,"...but I'm trying to understand why this is a good idea, for personal and financial reasons.

Quick background: My grandfather passed away this past May, and my grandmother has been living in an assisted living facility since then. Unfortunately, it is not likely that my grandmother will be coming home as she's not mobile enough and it makes her quite sad to be there (for understandable reasons).

My grandmother, my mother, and my mom's siblings (my aunt and my uncle) have been talking about apparently my grandmother wants to put my mother's name on the deed to the house. I'm not sure why she chose my mother, as she's the middle sibling and we live a couple hours away, while the rest of the family is within a 10-mile radius. The plan is that my cousin and her boyfriend will live there and pay the bills while my mother will be on the deed until my grandmother's death, which would result in my mother owning the house. If they don't pay the bills for whatever reason, my mom will have herself removed from the deed. The house is assessed at $148k and I can only assume that they own the house as they've lived there for nearly 50 years. (From what I understand, if the house was ever sold my mother would have to pay taxes on the difference between its value at the time of the sale and its value when it was purchased.) My grandmother plans on giving it to her as a gift, so federal tax forms apply. This is all in Vermont, if that matters.

I think this is all a shitty idea, but I'm biased because from what I understand, it impacts me negatively as a college student seeking aid. I may also be misunderstanding the implications of this, so please help me out, /r/personalfinance. I'm going into my sophomore year of college, and I get a VERY generous aid package from my private university (to the point where I pay only ~12k/yr in private loans - not ideal, but the best I got). My understanding is that the value of a 2nd property would nearly double my family's EFC (I used a net price calculator) and make going to college financially impossible. There is no way anyone in the family could or would ever sell the house, so I'm very afraid my school grant could be pulled.

Secondly, this sounds like an easy way to create drama in my family. My father resents my mother's side of the family because they weren't as supportive as they could've been (in his eyes) when my grandfather was ill and is constantly accusing them of being in it for themselves, especially my cousins who are around my age (19). My father badmouths the whole family if they come up in conversation, including my grandfather when he was still alive. However, my aunt even went so far as to stop talking to all of us for a couple of months when we couldn't drive him to his appointments, even though we live 3 hours away. The whole side of the family really only like my mother and I, and they tolerate my father and my younger brother. Overall, we really only see each other once a year or so and my family bitches about it the whole time. My grandmother clearly has good intentions in deeding the house over to someone in the family, but I just heard everyone arguing about it already so I think it's a bad idea.

I've recently been trying to become more responsible about personal finance and think one thing I should do is try and pay off my student loans ASAP.  

I have a chunk of money that I am looking to apply to one of my loans and my question is which one should I apply the money to:

I have a student loan under my name at an interest rate of 5.75 that I can payoff in full right now.

or

I have a student loan under my moms name that has an interest rate of 7.5 that I would be able to payoff about 1/3 of.

Logically it seems like I should just apply any extra money to whatever loan has higher interest, but I wasn't sure if having less debt under my name would benefit me in some other way which would make it more beneficial for me to pay off the loans under my name first.  Also just having a loan paid off that I dont have to think about anymore would be nice.

personalfinance,House confusion - to buy or not to buy in Japan?,"Hi everyone, sorry to bother you with a possibly difficult to answer question, but here it is.  Should my wife and I buy a house in Japan?

Here's the thing.  The Japanese house market is really quite different from western markets (I'm from Australia, for reference).  Interest rates here are around 1.5% at the moment which is actually rather high.  Additionally, when you buy a house here, you usually buy the land separately (on another mortgage, to my understanding, though my understanding is limited).  The biggest difference, though, is that houses depreciate in value here, and are usually worthless within 30 years of being built.

I guess I'm just having a hard time getting my head around buying something so expensive that will be completely worthless, but to make matters worse, rental housing either comes in the form of mansions (condominiums in the west) or very old and decrepit houses.  My wife and I are planning to live here for at least the next 10-15 years, and want a place in the countryside, close to her parents if possible.  Houses out there usually go for $200,000-$300,000 equivalent, and I've no idea about the land (actually sometimes people buy a house but rent the land, too, just to make matters worse).

My big question is, how do we work out the best plan of action is?    After those 10-15 years we may move to Australia, or if the job climate changes and it's better, we may move there and move back after about the same period.  One of the relevant factors in making that decision is houses and housing, though.  At any rate, it'll take us a few more years to get 20% down anyway, so we'll be renting until then I guess.  Any advice or thoughts would be very appreciated, and I'm sorry if I wasn't clear with information!

Other information about housing to help those who have no experience in Japan:
Mansions are small condominiums in concrete buildings, generally only in bigger cities (though some small towns have them too).  They are prime rental material and can also be bought, usually for about the same price as a house, but you don't get the land or even a chance to buy the land.  Pros - easier to resell (as long as it's still pretty new), or can be used as a rental.  Cons - it's not a house.  No garden, no real space to yourself.  Generally, mansions are small, and unless you buy, they are guaranteed to be small and/or expensive.

Apartments are the only other option, which are condominiums built out of wood and probably paper.  Damn cold, porous, and you can hear the person in the next apartment clear their throat.  So, not an option.

Oh, and due to houses being basically worthless after 30 years, buying a second hand house is very rare and problematic - especially as many of them don't adhere to recent changes in the earthquake prevention policies for the way they're built.  So we'd likely be building a new place.

Our finances: combined income after tax is around $5000 a month, before expenses.  We're putting away about 1300-1500 a month from that.  Combined savings are probably around $20,000, give or take a little in Australia I've just not been touching.",finance,1407112502

Another question I had is with Nelnet. I currently work in the public sector so in if I stick within the public sector I would be eligible for federal loan forgiveness after 10 years.

personalfinance,Anti-Debt Advice,"So from what I can tell the overwhelming majority of advice on this sub is that; for most people we take on too much debt and we need to accept a lesser standard of living of which we can afford. Makes Perfect sense! ""Live within your means"" and ""just because you can afford doesn't mean you should"" I've heard these multiple times... which also makes perfect sense.

My issue seems to be more with investments, and investment debt. It seems as though people are also issuing this default advice that no debt is the optimal situation, and while this may make sense for highly depreciable assets such as vehicles, does it also apply to lesser depreciable assets such as real estate?

With interest rates at an all time low (last couple years) why does it not make sense to leverage your ass off on an investment. I'll use real estate for an example (although there's always conflicting arguments at the profitability of real estate and its attractiveness.)

With 20% down + closing costs investment real estate can be acquired for 4% on 15yr note at the current time with good credit obviously. If after taxes, insurance, P+I, and hold back ( repairs, under-utilization,  etc) you are showing a $300-$500/mo positive cash flow, why on earth would'nt you leverage yourself to your eye balls. Inflation in the US has been floating in the 2-3% range since the crash and only looks to be heading upward. 4% seems like free money that nets a sizable positive cash flow. 

Govt backed loans freddy/fanny has new rules that says you may only have 4 properties mortgaged to qualify assuming one is your primary residence you can pick up a few duplexes that have HUGE returns or another house and score an extra 1000-1500 a month.

Please provide some feedback. Maybe I'm missing something.

Long story short - they sold him with a ballooning payment and adjustable rate loan, so not only have the payments increased per the agreement, but the changing interest rates are also increasing his payments. A car that was originally $150 a month is now $90 a week ($360 a month). He shorted his last monthly payment by $35, and the dealer repossessed his car on the next day.

In the short term, I have given him some money to help make ends meet for a week or two.

What are some things I can tell him to help him long term? So far I have suggested the following:

* Attempt to refinance with a credit union to avoid ballooning payments and adjustable interest rates
* Find out his remaining balance of the car - not sure if any of his payments have gone toward principal yet
* Register on CreditKarma to find out his credit score - it may not be as bad as he thinks
* Get a secured credit card to rebuild credit if it's not good

Any other situation-specific tips I should share?",finance,1407174748
personalfinance,"Long time lurker, a few general questions--and situation specific advice sought","Hi everyone! Firstly, wanted to thank this sub for being so awesome. I read posts here all the time and it has truly shaped my financial outlook. I've taken a lot of the advice here to heart but I have some general questions about investments and my own personal funding. I think I've got it mostly on the right track, but I wanted some input and some expertise that I've not been able to find.

1. I make about $37k after taxes (plus a tax return which I treat as not existing) and have about $12k in student loans left (just made a $2k payment on top of $500/mo payments). I contribute $100/month as well to a 503(b). It is not matched by my employer but it is pre-tax so I thought I should contribute to something. Should I up this to make my income look lower or get rid of it and put more towards loans? Should I look at another investment vehicle? I'm a teacher at a public school (Title I) so I have a pension which is contributed to. I do not plan to keep it in the pension, I will eventually roll it to a 401(k) as I don't plan to stay more than 5-7 years. I looked into loan forgiveness and it just didn't look like a good deal (only forgives up to $5k after 5 years). My car is paid off and I pay about $600/yr in insurance. No rent right now, I'm helping out my mom at the house--I give her about $300/mo plus food.

2. My girlfriend has about $70k in student loans and has not finished her master's yet--Public Health. Her job prospects look good but she seems to be crushed by the debt. I have a plan for her, but we may be moving cities which might throw me off a bit. She had about $10k of the ""loans"" on a credit card with 14% interest. I moved that money in a transfer (cost of 3%) to a 0% 15 month credit card in her name and I have advised her to take out more student loans to pay that debt before it becomes due. She'll have a total of about $75k in student loans after that. We'll be signing a pre-nup to keep these debts separate.

Both of the above student loans are at about 6.5%. I can refinance mine for 5.1%. Is it worth it for me? I started the process but they want so much paperwork and I expect to have it paid off this next year. Is it worth it for her to refinance (I assume it is)? Anyone else think these student loans are a complete ripoff? How can home loans be 4% and I'm paying 6%?

3. My mom. My dad passed away in 2010. He left her $100k in life insurance. That's down to about $80k (I think) and she had some retirement money with mass mutual in a couple of annuity mutual funds. I don't think she's able to properly manage these funds. She also has separate money with a financial advisor who apparently did **really** terrible last year (-10%). He charges her a 0.5% total account balance yearly to manage it. The mutual fund annuity did FANTASTIC last year (+28%), but has a GMAB rider that also costs 0.5%. I'm going to get rid of that rider when it expires. I'm looking to move the vast majority of her money to those mutual funds. I think the total is about $175k. Good move? I want to set some of that aside as an emergency fund for her, and about $20k in dividend stocks that my brother in law will manage. I know all of these investments have risk but it's my opinion that she needs the risk because her retirement funds are lower than they should be.

Where can I keep that emergency money for her? I was considering US Bonds. Would those be liquid enough for an emergency fund? I think they're earning around 1.6%. Obviously money markets, etc. are all worthless with interest rates where they are. Where else should I consider putting that emergency money or her retirement investment overall?

Thanks so much for any input!",finance,1407175277
investing,"About to start college, what to do with my savings so far?","Hey everyone,

I am new to investment, but having grown up in a very low income home I have always had an eye and interest for saving money. I'm 18 years old living in California and going to be starting my first year at a university in just a few months. Because of my families tough economic standing I am receiving oodles of financial aid from my university and, as a result, I won't have to spend much, if any, of the savings I have accumulated so far.

Working various jobs and saving up money for as long as I can remember, I've accumulated about $4,000 in savings. Discounting $1,000 for various college shenanigans, my question for you all is what are my smartest options for that $3,000 that I won't need to touch for probably another four years?

What should I do with my three grand? What are all of my options?

Bitcoin,Please help edit this response to NY BitLicense proposal. If passed 'as-is' the proposed rules will shut my business plans down; yet the lawyers claim to improve the jobs market with these rules.,"August 5, 2014

DFS Office of General Counsel - Dana V. Syracuse,
New York State Department of Financial Services,
One State Street, New York, NY 10004,


Greetings Dana V. Syracuse,

Money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities are of grave concern to both Virtual Currency operators and law enforcement organizations.  Like old fashioned cash, Bitcoin related technologies can contribute to illicit activity.  Neither the business community nor the public want Virtual Currencies to fall into the realm of black markets.  Practical and informed regulation is needed in this industry to ensure a safe and accessible experience for all participants.  Please know that the distributed computing technologies that make Bitcoin possible are extremely powerful to change the world drastically.  We will all have a better outcome if regulators work amicably with the developers of these systems.

Because of the shear power of distributed technologies, we need lawmakers to produce regulations which are perceived by all to be fair for all and in the best interest of all.  We need smart rule-making that specifically enables innovation, openness, and fairness.  These are the traits that have made Virtual Currencies popular in the first place, and it is imperative that the rules governing them inspire the same confidence among all people.  Practically speaking, virtual currencies handle worldwide transactions for free.  Savings accounts, payments, transfers and trading are all essentially free when done using virtual currencies.  As software and services are built on top, these services can and will be made available to the poorest among us for free.  Smart, innovative, regulations will help all consumers safely realize that promise sooner.

Besides the coming help for consumers, virtual currencies are also perfectly suited for business much the same as web-pages are.  Nearly every successful business today has a web presence in some form and no one can argue against the value that web pages have provided both to business and consumers.  Every business should have its own digital currency for several practical reasons: to manage coupons, promotions, in store credit, exchanges, and gift cards.  In order to fully utilize the benefit of Virtual Currencies, businesses also need the ability to utilize other practical functionality which is offered by digital assets.  Many of these new features are currently in early design and implementation stages.  Examples include brilliant work that will allow for automated accounting, automated repurchase of inventory, Cut and Paste business models, smart contracts, payroll, etc.  A primary concern of the BitLicense regulation is that there are no built in allowances to promote ongoing innovations that promise to streamline a spectrum of business and financial processes.

While Virtual Currencies are an amazing equalizing force for both consumers and business, the distributed computing eco-system has already evolved to provide even more business and financial services.  Now, whole systems of trust and business relationships are being developed and managed by open source computer code.  These systems are fair, transparent, and help all participants get exactly what they were expecting out of any business relationship.  Programmers are attempting to build a world where no one cheats because the computing arrangement over which deals are made prevent any participant from cheating.  Ongoing development of the underlying distributed computing software systems is crucial to a favorable outcome for consumers in this world.  Additionally, when all virtual currency and distributed computing related software is kept open source, these streamlined business activities become just as affordable to implement for Jan's Sandwiches as they are for Walmart and Starbucks to implement.

A practical example of how the New York BitLicense regulations might harm consumers is as follows:  Imagine that a consumer has $1.73 left on 12 different store's gift cards.  From personal experience, these cards get lost when the balance drops into that range because its more trouble than its worth to claim that last bit of value.  However, with a trade-able store credit and the magic of Virtual Currencies, the consumer is now empowered to trade those (12) random $1.73 cards in for (1) $20.76 card to the store of his or her choice.  Of course business owners should have the right to choose whether or not they want to participate, but this arrangement is obviously fair to the consumer who purchased the credits at fair value.  Clearly, section 200.3 (c)(2) of proposed regulation is not sufficient to allow small businesses to offer many of the consumer enhancing services which Virtual Currencies easily make possible.  Businesses need the freedom to issue their own virtual currency as easily as starting up a web-page, and it is in the best interest of consumers that they be allowed to trade any virtual currency freely.

FinCEN made a good common sense adjustment in their regulations on small businesses with regard to the buying and selling of precious metals.  For example, as long as a business owner keeps their buying and selling at a hobby level of less than $50,000 per year, they are exempt from licensing.  This is a very effective way to let someone design a business model and try it out; if they can make money, they can then seek investors and progress towards full compliance with standard regulatory policies.  We can set the expectation that new digital currency business ventures shall be vigilant to prevent their services from being used to launder money or finance terrorists without the costs normally associated with a full KYC/AML program compliance. 

At minimum, New York should allow for a Bit-Startup-License that costs a reasonable amount, $25.00 per year for example.  It should be issued by FinCEN so that there is only one license required nationwide.  It should be for businesses who have annual revenue of $250,000 or less and there should be an automatic inflation adjustment since we would want this regulation to be just as practical 25 yrs. from now.  The simple, straight forward process of retaining customer identities on accounts could be as simple as keeping a drivers license and utility bill on file.  A simple requirement to track large transactions over 10K per day is also manageable.  By keeping all of the required processes low cost, simple, and practical, we can prevent money laundering and criminal activity without hindering the amazing innovations that digital currencies represent.  As a bonus, we might actually create new jobs in this country where they are needed most.  If a state must amend the FinCEN rules it would be most practical for all that they keep the amendments to federal regulation to a minimum; otherwise consumers will incur increased costs and lower quality services. 

There is a huge cost of ""lost opportunity"" which is not considered accurately in the — RIS, a Regulatory Impact Statement which is required by New York law.  We small and start-up business owners have friends and family that also see the vision for benefit that Virtual Currencies offer to all of mankind.  We are working together to implement these technologies to provide innovative new services that will make people's lives better.  We can work our day jobs and go home at night and learn and program and make these innovations happen.  We can do this, and we can do it without big money.  When regulations require that small start-up businesses must obtain large amounts of capital to hire teams of people to perform arbitrary regulatory tasks, the natural effect is to prevent these small businesses from ever starting up.  The natural effect is to prevent these engines of job creation from ever getting off the ground.  What in these regulations will help someone in Jarrell, TX start an international trading company that provides jobs to disadvantaged mothers in South Carolina and Texas and valuable services to the citizens of New York and the rest of America?

If there is no help, and if there is no consideration for cost of compliance for small businesses, then all should assume the obvious: These regulations are designed to keep power and money and opportunity firmly in the grasp of the clinched fists of those who have it already.  People are desperate for jobs in this country.  The people who have jobs are desperate to keep them.  The whole of our current financial system is designed to systematically keep the average citizen in desperate conditions.  It is designed to keep them working as cogs on a wheel working for the owners of the machines.  There is pent up demand to change this, and when the time is right, change will come.  The owners of the machines should realize that this is good for all.  When people are free to realize their true potential, great progress is made that will benefit all.  Would you rather be a king in 1292, or a lowly multi-millionaire today?  Uninhibited development of digital currencies will make everyone's lives better. 

Those who desire to keep a stranglehold on money will best serve their own interests by letting go and encouraging this renaissance.  All of us will be better off if our current financial system embraces these innovations.  Rather than attempt to stifle competition from digital currencies via regulation, the current financial services industry should compete with their own innovations that provide basic banking and investment services to individual consumers for free.  People at the lower fringes of our economy are suffering.  It is time for changes that are designed to help them succeed.  Virtual Currencies, distributed computing, and automated business entities offer opportunity to all who are allowed to participate.  To raise the barrier to entry in this field accomplishes no more than to push the poor further into poverty.

Furthermore, the BitLicense regulations have failed to accommodate new distributed protocols that are currently in development or that have been recently released.  These distributed technologies apply to more than money now.  Whole business models will soon be implemented as a distributed computer script; and once those scripts are started, even the ""issuer"" has no control from that point forward.  If the script makes profit, it will provide whatever service it provides forever.  It will pay fees, investors, and vendors as stipulated in the founding instructions which are fairly and transparently programmed into the business model from the beginning.  It is mind-blowing what can be done not only in the financial sector, but for all business.  Human ownership is no longer required.  Competition and constant honing of these scripts will lead to almost all services being delivered to consumers at near cost and many services for free.  Fairness and transparency will be built into these systems because trust and reputation are the only real requirements for doing business.  Any person who claims an interest in advancing the quality of human life is wise to protect and foster open source software development.   Ad hoc, status quo regulations will not serve the common good in this case.   It is imperative that these systems remain transparent and fair. If not, the real criminals will find a way to go dark and the general public will be saddled with ongoing economic hardship round the world.

Despite the wild west and unregulated nature of Bitcoin, it has created many jobs and opportunity for a variety of people.  The community has made every effort to protect its participants from losing money.  As with stock market investing, some retail investors lose.  The regulated economy does no better; when a company goes bankrupt, it is of little consequence to the holder of common shares when they receive a $2.51 settlement.  Consumers are best served simply by warning them and educating them that the virtual currency sector is uninsured and that all invested funds are at risk.  The proposed regulations admit that they do nothing to insure customer funds or the value of virtual currencies.  Participants should be informed that to participate is to risk full losses.  The proposed regulations do nothing to mitigate the risk of full losses, and therefore, the cost of implementing the regulations in their current form is not justified.  These proposed regulations are appropriate only for a firm that does want to establish SPIC insurance protection for its customers.

Finally, with regards to the prohibition of the release of new virtual currencies; this is not consistent with judicial precedent and should absolutely be removed from the proposed regulations.  Open source code is protected free speech.  Individuals have a fundamental human right to communicate freely and privately with each other.  These proposed regulations will infringe on many people's ability to freely communicate with persons in the state of New York.


Conclusion

Please consider withdrawing the BitLicense proposal at this time for the following practical reasons:

1.  Virtual Currencies are international endeavours and are regulated more efficiently at the federal level.

2.  These BitLicense regulations have no accurate consideration for the costs of lost opportunity from their effective suppression of low capital start-ups in the virtual currency and distributed computing industries.

3.  There has been no demonstration of harm done --due to lack of regulation-- to consumers in the state of New York or elsewhere.

4.  The application of existing law has been effectively used to curtail unlawful and damaging activities which use virtual currencies.  Examples of good use of existing law include a ponzi scheme bust in Texas, the silk road bust, and the bankruptcy case for Mt.Gox.

5.  These regulations have no educated provisions for distributed trading and data exchange systems like the NXT Asset Exchange platform, Open Tranactions, Mastercoin, Ethereum, or Maidsafe.

6.  These regulations do not comply with previous court rulings.  Two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech protected by the First Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case).

Thank you for taking the time to read these concerns.

personalfinance,Question about loan analysis.,"Lately I feel like I've been throwing money at my student loans and I want to run some numbers to compare where I'm at right now with where I would be if I only spent the minimum.

In preparation, I have a list of all the loans in my name with the interest rates and disbursement dates. I started using mint.com a year or two ago, so I have some numbers to compare starting around July 2012. The first problem I'm running into is that the numbers on my first day of mint (7/30/12) do not match what I've calculated based on the details of my loan. It's only about $10 of difference, but I can't for the life of me figure out what I'm missing.

The 2nd issue is a bit more complex. I have a total of 7 loans, but my loan servicer (great lakes, if that helps) lumps them together and considers them 2 loans. This means that, according to great lakes, I have one loan with multiple interest rates. When I make a payment, I know that any outstanding interest is paid off first, but after that I do not know which loan receives the payment. Is there any regulated hierarchy that is followed in these situations?

Thankfully, if I can figure out the answer to my first question, I should be able to calculate where my payments are going. I'm mostly looking for any useful pointers or reading that may help me get to the bottom of my questions here.

Bitcoin,"So the Dollar, Pound, Euro, Yen etc. all sink, everyone trades in BTC. Nobody pays much if any tax. Libertarian dream? What next?","The Federal Reserve is studied in history books. Bitcoin has what would be a value today of $950,000 but because nobody is using dollars and inflation is out of control the real price in 2039 is about $143 billion dollars per bitcoin.

What would really happen if libertarian dreams came true?

Now, I might be better asking this type of question in libertarian subreddits, but I think it's as relevant here.

Personally, I like having subsidised or free healthcare and education and little fear of randomly being killed for my bitcoins because there's a police force able to assert the threat of violence on people that would attempt to do that, so far is has been effective at keeping me alive. I also feel comfortable knowing that water flows through the pipes in my building because of the society we live in and the structures provided by a shared responsibility. I have no plan for what I would do in the case of a fire because if it gets big enough people come automatically and I can get them to come anyway by phoning. That all happens for free.

Anyway, I don't want this to sound like an anti-libertarian rant, so I'm hoping that I state my position and all the intelligent, well-considered opinions of people who have thought longer and harder about this topic will be able to tell me what this world would look like.

One thing that I can foresee is little power of a government to wage unpopular wars. Although it is maybe possible that we'd have kickstarter-funded smaller wars, we probably wouldn't have the wars of today that people protest against but the government just prints the money to start them anyway.

But I wouldn't want to live in the world where there are competing fire departments or competing waterworks or competing companies laying cable for internet. I wouldn't want to hear about murders for people for their private bitcoins or to hear about mafia operations running entire neighbourhoods. It all sounds a lot too Mad Max for me. 

I'm quite content knowing I don't need to learn how to operate a gun, let alone own one. There has been a global trend towards decreased violence in human beings correlated with how much societal framework people have in place around them. Bands, Tribes, Fiefdoms, Kingdoms, Democratic Governments all provide varying levels of benefits to their elites and maintain a power imbalance, but provide greater levels of protection to the populace. There is also a trend towards more violence and aggressive behaviour amongst people with less resources.

A bitcoin world where we have a handful of what would now be equivalent to billionaires and millionaires sounds not so different to a few steps back in terms of societal advancement. 

It seems like if bitcoin/alt currencies really take off, then we have a lucky few and a world plunged into chaos.

I don't know, maybe we have chaos for a while, then people reach consensus about wanting the stability of the past and we get kickstarter governments that accelerate us back out of the brief period of tribalism and fiefdoms.

Given the theoretical premise of people stopping funding their governments, show me how I'm wrong or what the world
would really look like had all the world's currencies tanked.",cryptocurrency,1407186167

-Income- Me basically $1500/mo after tax Her $1,600/mo after tax.  Combined $3,000.  
-Expenses- Our rent is $1900/mo!!! nothing included, we pay water, heat, electricity etc... 

(I guess financially I need to specify, we throw both our paychecks into my bank account and I pay everything off the best I can, aka we are currently not holding grudges splitting everything 50/50, we split everything ""100"" out of our lump sums. we have both decided I'm best at giving a budget and keeping us out of debt)
Currently we don't really owe too much in bills, the main thing is our energy bill which I'm estimating including this month would be $375 (this includes some previous months balance over of minimum payments) 
I made my financial mistake 12 months ago when signing this lease so basically, my thoughts are ...get the heck out of this house and pay off the mistake once we actually have money to, e.g. our energy which we could put off this month, eat the low late fee on some bills and pay off in August and September.  

We are almost there, finally! and need a new place and moved in by 09/01/14.

Currently from moving we still owe our rent this month. $1900
We currently have just a bit over $2000  (this whole month we will actually have more than $3000 because I get paid 3 times)  So we have $2000 right now and I will have 1400 fluxing in on the 15th($700) and 29th($700)

The owners of the house have been showing it and we had to buy extra cleaning/packing supplies etc...  so this month were kinda screwed, especially in the sense we have to put a deposit on a new place and most likely pay 1st month rent as well.  Also moving truck, more packing supplies, etc... all this fun stuff just to get into a reasonable place to save money again.  

Current dilemma-  We owe $2000 yesterday and have about $2100  Simple pay rent right?  Can't  I get paid next on the 15th (~$700)  so... I need a loan.  Reasons simplified, I need to pay current rent, moving expenses,a deposit for new place and1st month rent at new place.

I texted my father asking where I should get a loan from (he's wealthy and I was kinda hoping he would say ""oh dear son, just loan from me"" and.. he gave me a number of his friend who is the owner of a business that gives out installment loans.  I will be calling this guy tomorrow morning before work.  What kind of things should I look out for?  I know nothing about loans and googled and have heard bad things about these loans.  Other options?

My plan is to loan $1500  and have monthly payments of $300 tops, and when I can pay more than minimum, can you pay more than the minimum on a installment loan?

If anything needs to be explained more please ask I really need some sound advice by tomorrow so I don't get myself stuck in more worse of a situation.

What kind of interest rates and term should be expected?  I heard these things can get out of hand quick but if i make minimum payments on time can they be restructured against my consent etc...

250k loan looks like a $1200-1300 a month (mortgage + taxes) with zero down. The rental market is student housing in a thriving market. 3 bedroom houses near campus range from $1500-$2400. If I can get $1800 (which appears possible for this hypothetical house) that would be enough to cover the mortgage and light maintenance. 

What I like about this:
Pay off student debt.
Purchase an income generating property that I don't think I could comfortably afford with a mortgage and separate student loan payment.
If I go bankrupt I can walk away from the loan.

What I fear about this:
I've converted the student loan debt to a 30 year loan with a slightly smaller interest rate. This could cost me a lot unless I am able to sell the house for more than 250K after 10 years. 
I've turn 50k in debt into 250k. Just focus on the 50k.
No bank is going to loan me an extra 50k for ""improvements""

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.",finance,1407208723

news,Cando Car Loans- Best Car Finance,"Finally, when it comes to apply for the finance or loans the interest loads our pocket. It too bears upon our monthly savings as well. This often puts a burden along the shoulders of the applier long procedure and heavy paper work is directed to obtain a loan these days. For those masses who are self-employed, lenders have finally realized the deficit in this area and they have truly worked hard to unfold up the marketplace for this group of citizenry.
We suffer the idea about this concept that not all the borrower’s fit into the area of the financial institutions or lenders because the interest rate really affects the soul. Small business owners don’t have the criteria to lend up the money in the marketplace. That’s why we are here to specialize in the field of lending the loan at lower and cheaper rates. We are here to meet the wants and desire of the clients its necessary for each and every house to execute the bidding of their final consumers to establish long term relationships. We defend those individuals who don’t deliver the supporting documentation to receive a conventional auto loan. Actually Low Doc Cars are designed for anyone that does not receive the income documentation to defend a traditional loan application.
Cando car loans specializes for sole traders, contractors, independent advisors and anyone who is engaged in changeable employment. For a pair of years, these people have experienced great difficulty when it came to get finance, as they establish themselves in a position where they face difficulties in showing proof of a stable and long term personal cash flow. Low doc car loans make it possible for anyone without evidence of long term earnings, to purchase a vehicle under finance. If you are attempting to calculate out which financial product is good for you, and so it can be really perplexing. In fact, we will recommend discussing you your birth with your tax professional or attorney. Leasing is a well-known method of improving cash flow management and keeping up your cash for your core job or for projects offering better returns on capital. Hire purchase options are available and function in a similar way to a loan to purchase an asset. Nevertheless, to simplify your decision process, we outline the options available to you. In edict to settle on the most appropriate character of finance you first require to see whether you wish to own the asset at the remainder of the rental period?
Cando car loans are planned for those borrowers who do not have up to date tax returns available. They are available to borrowers who fit all of the following standards.
•	Own a commercial enterprise and necessitate one or more vehicle.
•	Tax Returns are not wanted.
Ace of the Directors of the company must be a property owner. Possibly one of the most frustrating aspects of being self-employed is when it gets to obtaining finance. Whenever it comes obtaining a loan it requires fewer documentation lies within you. On the other hand the crucial aspect is your physical condition as well.

I'm currently in my 10th year of post-secondary education (about to finish up!) but my bills have really started to pile up significantly, as well my income has just been significantly reduced. 

I've done everything I can in terms of reduce my bill load (ie. switching to a lower cost wireless provider, moved to low-cost housing, prepare all my meals etc.). 

This is all well and good, but I have several lines of credit and credit cards which are saturated from my student debt. The interest rate just went up on one of my cards (called and they can't do anything to reduce it), and the increased payment has put my finances into seriously unmanageable territory.

I've begun to consider debt consolidation, but really don't know to much about the process. 

Am I able to do this through my bank? Will I need a co-signer? How much money will it save me? Most importantly, will this destroy my credit? 

I've applied for medical school, and I'm worried that if I take a significant hit on my credit score that I will not be able to secure further financing for school.",finance,1407238979

personalfinance,"To sell, or not to sell? That is the question...","Hi PF, I'm hoping you can help me through a quandry here and shed some light on the most sensible thing for me to do.

My girlfriend and I are young (late 20s, early 30s) tech professionals in Scotland, with a joint income of £72,500pa. We each have a 4 month emergency fund, no debt other than a mortgage on our flat, and £6k in an ISA. We have only in the past few months gotten a handle on our finances and are now looking to the future.

Our jobs are very stable, and if the worst came to the worst neither of us would be unemployed for more than a few days due to our standing in the local tech community, so no worries about income stability. 

Our apartment purchase price was £98,000 six years ago, mortgage was for £83,000, current mortgage is £75,714, current valuation of property is ~£82,000 - the bottom fell out of the market just after we purchased, and it's still in recovery.

Mortgage interest rate is 3% (variable, tracks 2.5% above BoE base rate, currently 0.5%), monthly minimum repayment is £295.

We want to move house in the not too distant future, preferably within the next year to two years, but what we do with the current place is a conundrum to me.

We'd like to buy a place for around £200,000, with a 20% deposit saved. This would get us a lovely detached home in a good neighbourhood, while remaining well within budget.

After all expenses, rainy day savings et al, we have £2000 per month we can put towards savings or overpayments on the mortgage, I've been playing around with the numbers and am unsure what our best option is.

If we maximise savings and maintain minimum payments on the mortgage, we can have enough saved by the end of 2015 to sell the current place, realising that loss, and moving onwards and upwards to our new home.

If we increase to maximum repayments we can afford on the mortgage and minimise savings, we can have the mortgage paid off mid-2017, with a 20% deposit for our new place saved up by late 2018. Benefit of this is that we're not realising the sunk cost, and we can rent it out via an agency once we move. We can also potentially sell it if/when it increases to a suitable value again. Downside is that it means we won't be moving for a further three years vs saving and selling.

What would you do? A large part of me is very tempted just to save rapidly, sell, and move on. Any advice appreciated! :)",finance,1407243394

personalfinance,Strategy/Advice sought for financing a car,"Hello PF! I am about to pay off my 2004 Toyota Camry, which I financed over a 5-year period, paying about $250 per month with an interest rate of around 3-5% (exact rate unknown). My payment was ludicrous because I had to buy a car in a tough situation 5 years ago and barely had any money to put down. I use this car to get to and from work (18.8 miles one way) and occasional trips to friends who live within 60 miles of me. Moving closer to work is not a goal or priority at this time.

Currently, I make $45K, have minimal credit card debt (under $500, will be paid off next month); a very large student loan (paying minimum payments every month); my credit score is in the mid 700s.

Let it be known I am not looking for a car right away. My ideal plan is to continue to drive the Camry, which is in decent shape, and according to KBB.com may be worth around 2k for trade in (lower end of estimate to be safe). My game plan is to automatically transfer the money I was using toward the car every month until I accrue roughly $2000 cash. 

I'd like to buy something that is at least 2-3 years old and am looking for a car similar to the camry, but perhaps smaller and with better MPG (so, perhaps a 2011 corolla or honda civic). 

My ultimate goal is that I'd like to get a monthly payment way below 250 (180ish would be great). $250 a month for 5 years was do-able, but a pain in the butt. 

I'm looking for some analysis here. Because my current car is in good shape, I have time on my side to save money and walk away if I'm not happy at a dealer. Should I save up more cash before shopping? Any other advice?

I am trying to keep the payments close to what I am paying now, and try to lower the term on the higher interest rate 15 year loans to 10 most likely. At both DRB and SoFi I would chose fixed interest rate which seems like the best option. Both offer about 4.75-6% fixed for 10 years. 

So which loans do I apply for consolidation? 

Right now I pay 3 different places but have it set to auto-pay so I have no issues with any missed payments.



Another question I had is with Nelnet. I currently work in the public sector so in if I stick within the public sector I would be eligible for federal loan forgiveness after 10 years.

I am eligible for Income Contingent Repayment which would lower my monthly to $366.16. I would like to stay in the public sector but this is obviously not guaranteed.

Bitcoin,The option for governments,"I'm waiting for the moment, one government, just one government figures out the window of optionality they still have when it comes to Bitcoin and monetary power in the future.

personalfinance,Consolidating 4 cc's worth of debt? (US) x-post /r/debt,"I apologize in advance for my lack of financial knowledge - I am absolutely terrible at this and I suppose that's why I'm here. 
 
I am 26, live in the US and have 4 credit cards open, all totaling a debt of around $17k. Being an idiot kid, I opened cards without really doing research, after promising myself I wouldn't do that. Lesson learned, I guess. My Visa has a high interest rate (21.5%), as does my Amex BlueSky. I have two charge cards, one with a ""pay over time"" ability on it. They all have an annual fee, because, again, I wasn't smart. I did not know about balance transferring before opening the second charge card, or, well, any of them for that matter. This is the only debt I will have after paying off my student loans at the end of the year. 

I'd like to consolidate these because I just feel like I'm drowning with all the pay by dates, and the interest just keeps knocking me back. I don't know how well respected a site like CreditKarma is, but just looking at my finances at a glance, it basically breaks down my lowered score is because of high credit utilization. I'm at 85%, which is horrible and something I'm not proud of at all. I do, however, get an excellent score in the ""paying on time"" field, because I have NEVER missed a payment on ANY of my cards. I have a 100% pay on time rate. They are always paid. Some months I have the ability to pay more than just the minimum amount due, some months I don't. I have never had anything go to collections, or had any sort of derogatory marks on my credit. 
 
I would just really like one payment a month. Would balance transferring to one card allow me to do this? CreditKarma says I have a ""very good"" chance of qualifying for the Chase Slate, which offers 15 mos no interest on balance transfers, and 0% interest for 15 mos on new purchases, and breaks down how it would utilize my current debt. I would not touch this card for purchases, only to pay off, and I would close my two newest cards, the BlueSky and the Visa. I would keep one charge card for every day use (I have already created a budget, and would pay it off every month), and cut the other up, but leave the account open (it is my oldest card and I would only be keeping it for the age of credit boost until my other card is old enough.) Based on my current salary, I could set aside $1,000 a month minimum and, with a few extra hundred here and there when I have it, pay off my whole debt within a year, or a year and a half tops.
 
Does this sound like something that is feasible? Am I in a really bad place here? I just feel awful that my credit score could be so much higher, and I'm always playing catch up in my credit card bills because of the pay cycles and due dates. I'm sorry for the x-post to /r/debt, but there isn't all that much activity over there and I'm desperate.

Bitcoin,Game Changer: Bitcoin research at the Federal Reserve and how I've lost my job,"**UPDATE**: I'm traveling and hence haven't answered any more questions. I've gotten many more inquiries and as I said in one of the posts am currently vetting various outlets. I decided against giving proof to a community member and will instead opt for disclosure with a reliable business/economics news source. *Stay tuned*.

**The Background**: I'm a trained economist with a B.S. in Computer Science, a M.S. in Operations Research, and a PhD in Econometrics. I interned at the NY Fed during my degree, worked at a macro trading hedge fund, and now work at the major S.E. Fed branch doing econometrics and related modeling. I've had a long running interest in bitcoin and was one of the first people to publish a working paper on FPGA based bitcoin miners at a Georgia university focused on technology. I know bitcoin, technology, and economics on a theoretical and applied level. I'm not motivated by money (see my move from hedge fund to fed); I'm an applied academic with an incessant drive for research.

**The Job**:  I function as a briefing researcher at the Federal Reserve. My primary research interests are the statistical modeling of developing currencies and the integration of those models into our massively parallel simulations for policy projections and forecasts. In layman's terms, I do the lower level mathematical/statistical research and then brief senior management (fed governors) at our regular meetings.

At the beginning of May, my team and I were assigned to an exploratory project. Typically summer is the off-season and most of the projects are time fillers that result in a few papers/presentations and are then archived and never heard of again. This project was different. We were given a direct research assignment from the Board of Governors a few hours after the conclusion of their May 29th closed meeting.

**The Assignment**: We and as far as I know several other research teams across the Fed system were tasked with creating a bitcoin report. I assigned my team to run the typical econometrics simulations and forecasts we do for developing currencies. Thinking this was summer doldrum busy work, we were diligent on calculations and modeling but definitely did not go out of our way to provide extra insight. At the end of June, I presented the report to my Fed governor and was met with strong disapproval and a sense of upmost urgency. Long story short, I almost lost my job for not taking this project as seriously as I should have and the Board of Governors renewed the projct and gave us explicit research directions along with weekly addendums.

**The Dirty**: **We were directed to upgrade our modeling of bitcoin from developing currency to a major currency**. In addition to all of the common modeling and forecasting that task entails, we were instructed to do full simulations of money flows, interest rates, multi currency derivative baskets, risk metrics, and their effects on global macro monetary policy and trade agreements. What we found was **shocking**. Even with a mediocre adoption rate and variable growth rate, bitcoin severly disrupts how we model, forecast, and ultimately understand currency interactions to make monetary policy decisions. **This is a huge technological, monetary, and policy disruption** which leaves the Fed, the US govt, and other entities with much less control. Our best case scenarios are modeled upon current bitcoin adoption rates which have simulated a tipping point for the year 2026 (worst case 2021); this time frame projects the Fed (via the dollar) to lose its dominant global monetary policy maker status - instead everything will superceded by bitcoin. 

I presented this updated report along with all of our modeling work and simulation outputs which were statistically and independently verified to the Board of Governors. The Board was highly alarmed and interrogated me and my fellow researchers in a 3 day session trying to understand every point of our research. It must be remembered that unlike politicians, the Board of Governors is a very well educated and empirical group with an ability to conceptually grasp complicated research. 

**The Outcome**: Three weeks after the report, my research team was disbanded, I was moved to a tiny regional federal reserve branch and given virtually no research resources. Similar fates came to my team members and most of us are actively trying to pursue opportunities outside of the system. While the classified information nondisclosure agreements bind us in many ways, I personally will try to go back into the trading industry with a keen eye on bitcoin as my primary research interest.

**It is clear to me that Bitcoin has fundamentally changed the spectrum of how we view and model economics. The central banks are afraid, the governments are afraid, and they would rather bury the truth by firing their own dedicated researchers and archiving the reports than embrace change and building a sustainable economic future.**

personalfinance,What's the best option? Auto finance question.,"My husband unfortunately broke his leg last year at work, and the time has come for our workman's compensation settlement.  One thing we wanted to take care of was our auto situation.  

He currently drives a 2008 Ford Escape with about 98,000 miles on it.  Runs fine and there is really nothing wrong with it. Daily commute to work is about 20 miles one way.  

We currently owe $9,000 and have a very high interest rate (thanks to me having to do a short sale and the car being in my name).  Our monthly payment is $450, which is also very high.  I should note I have much better credit now though :)

The car is currently worth about $9,000.   The options I see we have are the following:

1. Pay off the car, and enjoy the extra monthly cash flow not going to a auto loan, until we need something new.

2.  Go ahead and trade in the Escape for what we owe, and use the $9,000 as a down payment on a new car.  The Escape is getting high in miles and a more family friendly vehicle (I am pregnant with twins due in November) is something we would like.  Between two kids, dogs, strollers ect. the Escape will be big enough while they are infants but a 5 seater will become small quickly.  And our other vehicle is a car.

So I'm stuck on whether it's better to just use the $9,000 to pay off the vehicle or take advantage of the trade in and use the $9,000 as a down payment for something new, understanding the longer we wait the more the Escape will depreciate. 

Any suggestions?  Cars are bad investments in the first place :(",finance,1407264887
investing,Treasury Bond ETF Questions,"[IEI](http://etfs.morningstar.com/quote?t=IEI)

Hello. How are you? After looking at this particular iShares ETF and was greatly confused. I was hoping more well versed investors of this subreddit would be kind enough to clarify some of my questions, as follows:  

It appears to me that this fund (price) did not particularly correlate strongly to interest rates? Specifically, I am referring to the post 08 housing bubble where interest rates tumbled greatly. Additionally the fund seems to continually increase with decreasing interest rates around the QE.   

May the decrease not effect the principal and is solely a dividend payout change? I noticed that the dividends have nearly halved since the 08-14 despite the growth of the funds assets (due to interst rates). Would it be reasonable to say intermediate duration funds assets tend not to be as sensitive to the FED interest rate changes (At least in terms of the principal) due to the quick to semi-quick maturity rates; are reflected in the dividend payouts instead?

On a side note, since this ETF holds 99% in US treasury and 1% corporate, how would I report these dividends payouts? Could it be entirely tax free? 

Any kind of push in the right direction would be appreciated! 

Thanks,

personalfinance,Rollover IRA versus taking a 401k distribution? Pros/Cons,"I have recently changed jobs and my old company is kicking me out of their 401k plan, which is fine.  Now I have the option of putting in a rollover account or take the distribution, and I need someone knowledgeable weight in on pros and cons. 

The reason that I am considering taking the distribution is that my family situation could use injection of funds as we have to cut out family budget in half to raise young family and pay for misc medical bills.  As a result, our debt load has increased a little more then I would have wanted to. I guess I should specify that we are nowhere close to bankruptcy. 

We could wait 3-4 years to pay down debts when my wife re-enters work force and maintaining the debt at a pretty high rate (~12%) and still increase the load, or pay it down now and bring us to a point where we are cash flow positive. Once my wife does re enter the work force, then we can drastically increase our saving level.

If I do decide to keep the money in a sheltered account, I can probably expect 8% yearly return, which is lower then the interest rate. The other downside is that I am expecting the tax rate to increase as the current tax rate is clearly unsustainable and will be even less as the boomers retire in droves. 

What I don't know is how to estimate the tax penalty, but also, I am having hard time visualizing the math between the two scenarios. 

Financial advisors that I have shared this with can only talk about the one side of the issue, and clearly avoid the distribution part. (they make no money if you take the distribution...).

personalfinance,(CAN) How much of a credit score drop can I expect from one month of high utilization?,"**TL;DR at the ass end**

I currently have a nearly-perfect credit score.  I think it was 850 at Equifax when I checked.  This is most likely due to me having successfully paid off $38k on a student loan (line of credit) from March '13 to May '14, and having extremely low credit utilization on my Mastercard.  I currently have no debts.

However, this month, I got a little cocky with contributions to my long-term savings, RRSP, and my employer's RRSP.  I was going to eek by (in the black) until payday, August 15th, and then get a lot more breathing room.  But I failed to plan for a $1k bill for travelling that I must take.

I've paid for this on my Mastercard, but I just realized it's going to post on my Mastercard tomorrow or Wednesday, in plenty of time for my bank to report 25%+ credit utilization on the 9th!

Will this nuke my credit score?  I am getting ready to apply for a car loan in mid- or late-September!  If I get restricted to a high interest rate or a long-term loan because of an idiot mistake like this, I'm going to be heated.

An option I have is to grab the funds out of long-term savings to take the Mastercard down to $0 by the time of the statement and pay it back ASAP.  If it's going to drop my score significantly and impact my purchasing power, I can do that with no penalties or fees.

personalfinance,28 year old; Rebalancing ROTH IRA,"Howdy!  I am a 28 year-old who just recently gobbled 20k out of my 401k for a down-payment on a house (the max tax-free withdrawl) since rates were so low (I got a 30-year, 156k at something like %3.56m, fixed) and then rolled the rest into my ROTH IRA.   I'm currently making the maximum match (%2) that my current employer offers to their SIMPLE IRA, because I am unsure of how to deal with the funds available to me (Fidelity... I don't know, it's unlike the 401k I moved from... plus, for a while I wasn't sure about job security as I work for a startup).

Okay -- so let me summarize:

* 28 years old,  100k/yr

* Debts: 156k mortgage @ %3.56; 9k Car at %4.9 (I'm never ever buying new again -_-)

* Cash: 30k in a super-crappy %0.XX checking account

* ~8k in the SIMPLE IRA of my new employer

* ~39k in my ROTH IRA -- and honestly I don't know when to roll my SIMPLE IRA over, but would prefer everything in the same account

And finally, my question:

If you were me... how would you invest or re-target an IRA?  My current allocation is kind-of all over the place -- I have a few market-sector funds that have been doing OK, but my overall return has been %4 or so over the last 3 years which is.. kind-of meh -- I get the feeling I'd be better off primarily invested in some SM, MED, LRG Vanguard index blend and then grabbing some bonds when the interest rates stop being so stupid-low -- maybe 5 or 10 years from now?

Wat do?

Any people with FIdelity got some good advice for indexes or... whatever?  

How do I figure out what is a good investment or index?  I sort-of went with market-sector funds for technology and healthcare, two sectors I know a lot about and feel pretty confident will continue to grow...

personalfinance,(CA) 2 homes worth $600k or 1 home worth $600k,"Here's my situation:
I own 2 houses that are right beside each other, my family and I live in one, and my mother-in-law lives in the other.  It's a great setup and we all get along famously.

The problem is that Mom is ""renting"" from us, but I still end up covering about $1,000 / month in expenses to keep the second house going.

I don't think that $1,000 / month is working well for me, so I've started looking into building a new house that accommodates all of us.  This would be a separate suite for Mom in the basement.

Existing houses approximately $600k combined value.
New house would be about $630k.

1 house is paid off, the second one has about $270,000 mortgaged, so my total equity is approximately $330,000.

Using estimated utilities and other expenses, paying off about $20,000 in a car loan, and using current interest rates, my calculations show that the new house would cost me about $400 more each month.

I can afford the $400 increase, but I'm not sure I want to, or if it is the best use of my money.

So my questions are:
1. Are 2 40 year old houses better assets than a brand new house worth slightly more?
2. What am I not thinking about here?

personalfinance,What to do?!,"Hi all. My husband and I are a young couple and we're expecting our first child in January. We both have awful credit, me due to student loans etc, and he due to a repossessed car and a credit card issue, etc.  We own a music store which realistically has turned into a time consuming hobby. We make almost no money from the store, although there is a possibility that could change this September.

We have been given the opportunity to move out west (currently living northeast) with my parents for no rent while we collect ourselves financially and essentially reevaluate our lives, which would obviously mean giving up our store. 

I need serious guidance about the right financial move to make. Husband desperately wants to stay put, I am extremely uneasy about this as I'm convinced we can't afford it, and I am tired of us putting everything into the store and getting nothing in return. 

I'll give you what info I have, and can you help me see more clearly with the idea in mind that I want to work to fix our credit and put money toward savings? 

Possible monthly rent: $850 (currently live with his parents for free but I refuse to live here when baby comes. Found a place that doesn't require credit check, rent includes utilities.)

Food: Estimate $400-500/mo. (We are both extremely tall people with fast metabolisms, beans and rice once a day causes starvation, especially for pregnant self.)

Gas: $400/mo.

My income: $1000 - $1300/mo. after taxes (Complete estimate, I teach private music lessons so my income depends entirely on student availability and willingness.)

His income: $800/mo. after taxes (another estimate - he works odd hours in a machine shop when he's not working the store, and also does some instrument repair.)

Phone/internet: $0 (no internet, phone is paid through store as business expense.)

Car payment: $0

Insurance: $152/mo.

Extras: $20/mo. business incidentals

Indulgence: $16/mo. Netflix

Current student loan payment: $27/mo. (Just federal student loan payment plan. Eventually this will probably get up to about $700-$900/mo. with private loans.)",finance,1407287815

Bitcoin,BTC Research,"Bitcoin was a great candidate for research because so much of the activity surrounding it takes place online, wrote the team in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society. Bitcoins are a virtual currency which depend on people using their computers to both generate the cyber coins and to verify transactions carried out with them.

Currently one bitcoin can be exchanged for $585 (£347).

Studying the ""digital traces"" of this activity could help lay bare the variables that govern the way the virtual currency behaves said the team.

The four key variables that emerged from the analysis were:

the size of the user base
the number of searches for information
the amount of information shared
price
From this the team at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich managed to find two positive feedback loops that steadily influence how much each bitcoin was worth.

The first ""reinforcement cycle"" involves an increase in the amount of searching for information about bitcoins, which leads to more chatter about the currency and prompts a rise in its value.

""The successive price surges in the Bitcoin economy are largely due to its growing public attention,"" said the team.

The second feedback loop involves a rise in search volume which makes more people download the software and join in the mining pools that generate coins. This too tends to lead to a rise in the nominal value of Bitcoins.

""Our analysis suggests that the successive waves of growth of the Bitcoin economy were driven by corresponding waves of new users from public circles gradually opening to the currency"" wrote the researchers.

In addition, they found found that search spikes were early indicators of an imminent drop in its value but added that this did not act as a good predictor of the biggest falls in the value of bitcoins.",cryptocurrency,1407304119
news,Simple Boat finance interest rates,"It is easy to secure a boat loan online nowadays. There are many finance companies which are willing to give out boat loans. Australia has plenty of these financers who are authorized to give out it to capable  consumers. It is simple to get approval for a marine  loan request when it is applied online. The online screen is easy to operate new boat loans or cando boat loans and there are very few boxes of information needed for an immediate processing.
The processing of this loan is very fast; one can receive an affirmation within the same day if the borrower meets the borrowing criteria. Low rate  are available at both variable as well as fixed rate. There are many types of  marine loans Australia lenders in the market today. The commercial lenders can offer better rates than the banks. Hence, more boat purchasers prefer to take a loan from these smaller commercial boat finance Australia lenders than from banks. 

The types of boat loans available are:
* Fixed Rate finance- For fixed rate loan, you need to pay a fixed sum of money monthly. It will help you to manage your budget, as well. Conversely, for variable rate loan or adjustable rate loan the interest rate fluctuates with a change in market interest rate.
* Variable Interest Rate Loan
* Simple Boat finance interest rates
* A Balloon Payment Boat credit
Keep in mind that your credit history, job stability, income, size of down 
payment and length of the marine loan all will play factors in the terms you 
can get, as well as which type of boat finance would be best for your financial 
situation.
Once the cando boat loan is taken care of, you'll be ready for lots of great experiences 
and adventures on your new boat.
Three simple steps to take boat finance
1)	Should be to verify that your credit reports are accurate to ensure you qualify for ship loans with the best rates and terms. Upon receipt of your loan application the lender checks your credit file.
2)	should be to locate companies that specialize in ship loans. Speak to a few companies that specialize in boat loans and tell them what you are looking for. Ask each boat loan broker to outline all of your loan expenses so that you can later compare all of your options.
3)	to determine the value of the boat you are about to purchase. This is vital when obtaining ship loans and a good boat advance broker will prove invaluable to you in determining the true current value of the boat you are looking to purchase and finance.

Champaign, I am NOT a physicist. I’m a science writer and technical editor, and my main job in the 
department is to assist faculty in preparing and submitting research proposals to federal funding 
agencies. (No questions about quantum mechanics, please!) I also team-teach two classes in 
technical communications, one for upper-level undergraduate physics majors, and one for graduate 
students, that focus on improving students’ skills in communicating science—both written and 
orally. I personally believe that most sloppy writing is just sloppy thinking made manifest, and that 
by focusing on writing better, scientists become better scientists, too. Writing disciplines your mind, 
and the act of reducing amorphous thoughts to structured, formal language crystallizes your thinking 
in a way that nothing else can. In academia, we often say that you don’t really know something until 
you can explain it to somebody else. I think the first step to that explaining is being able to write that 
idea down.

I’d like to share some basic techniques for how you can make your talks and papers 
more clear, concise, and compelling and suggest areas where you should focus your attention to 
make your technical communications more effective. 

The three most common mistakes that I see are 

1) failure to analyze the audience to whom a paper or talk is directed; 


2) long, complex sentences that interfere with the transmission of meaning; and 


3) lack of a clear, logical organizational structure. 


At tomorrow’s [ACS Webinar](http://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/340950898), I’m going to 
focus on abstracts, the quality of which often determines if anybody actually reads your paper or 
comes to your talk. I’ll share a simple, four-step method to crank out clear, concise, compelling 
abstracts with minimal fuss. 


I’ve posted many of the lectures and course materials that I’ve developed for my classes on my 
U of I website: http://physics.illinois.edu/people/profile.asp?cmelliot. Just scroll down to the 
bottom of the page to find the links in the “Additional Information” section. My students seem to 
particularly like my “Ms. Particular” micro-lectures on common mistakes in scientific writing (http://people.physics.illinois.edu/Celia/MsP/MsParticular.htm).

Thanks, everyone, for inviting me into your community and posing such thoughtful questions.  I'm afraid I've got to get back to my physicists now, but I'll continue reading your questions and posting answers in the next few days.  I'd like to leave you with one final thought--writing well is not an art, it's a craft.

Background: I just graduated in May, and I'm planning on building an $7-8k security fund before I start paying on loans. I have 2 separate loans, one that's subsidized and is not currently accruing interest for $5.5k and another for $28k that is unsubsidized, and is currently accruing interest. I've looked on the website for my borrower and I can't find the interest rate, but I think it's about average for federal (non-personal) student loans.

The situation: my loans won're *require* me to start making payments until probably November, but I'll have my savings cushion within a month or maybe 2, so I would like to start paying on the loan(s) early. My Dad (who is very good with money management) suggested that I throw money at the larger loan because it is currently accruing interest. That makes sense, but my thought process is that when I start paying I'm gonna throw approximately $2k/ month at my debt, so I thought it may be a better idea to knock out the smaller loan exclusively first, so that when the time came and I actually got a bill for the remaining balance, I'd only have one loan left to focus on, and could therefore pay it down faster than I would have by dividing my payments among 2 loans.

TL;DR-- throw money at big loan that's accruing interest and have 2 payments when they both come due, or focus down the smaller loan so when the big one comes due I'm only got one payment to make?


Edit: let's assume the interest rate is 2.5% annually, for dicussion purposes. I think that's pretty close to the real number.",finance,1407351988
personalfinance,"Where to get a car loan with ""no income?""","Hey guys,

In a bit of a pickle here! I am needing to get a new (see: used) car because mine is almost to the point where repairs and upkeep are going to cost more than the car is worth. 

I have a great credit history, never missed any payments, credit card is hovering around 50% usage, have a few loan accounts ive completed out in the past, etc. etc.

Anyways, the problem I am coming to is neither of my two banks (Navy Federal and USAA) will grant me a car loan without a cosigner because as far as they are concerned I have basically no income. I am a student however who is currently on the GI bill. I receive roughly 1600 a month in military benefits and 350 a month in drill pay. They wont look at my military benefits since they aren't taxed. I have 2 semesters of school left and I have a job lined up upon graduation so I am not worried about that aspect, I just need to be able to pick up a used car! I am only looking to borrow 10,000 or less as a 60 month payment at 4% would put me at roughly 10% of my current salary. Even less so for my salary post graduation.

Where the heck does one turn to get a car loan in a situation like this? Should I just try to finance through a dealer? I have always heard/tried to avoid that route because sketchiness, but perhaps you guys know more than I do.

personalfinance,[Help] Looking for help in consolidating my credit cards,"Hey everyone. So, I just did A LOT of number crunching, and I'm still kind of at a loss for what to do first and foremost, so here is everything as clearly as I can put it. Your help would be greatly appreciated!

**Goal:** To reduce debt and interest rates, raise credit score.

**Current Credit Score:** 614

**Total Debt:** $62,000

**The Breakdown (Card: Current Balance | Limit | Interest Rate)**

* #1: $2400 | $2500 | 10.24%
* #2: $1941 | $2000 | 19.99%
* #3: $1532 | $1600 | 19.99%
* #4: $2001 | $2000 | 19.99%
* #5: $1954 | $2000 | 22.9%
* #6: $832 | $1000 | 21.9%
* #7: $588 | $600 | 22.9%
* #8: $94.64 | $150 | 24.99%
* #9: $762 | $999 | 24.99%

Been paying minimum balances for a while, it's hard for me to find enough $ to pay higher. Admittedly, I was spending a lot on things I didn't need, so I've been cutting things out and hope to do better.

**Student Loans:** Currently in forbearance to catch up on other bills for a bit. I know, so much interest. Resuming again in Sept. Normal minimum payment for that: $226/month. Balance: $33,000

**Car Loan:** Initial balance: $16,000. Current balance: $12,000. Monthly payment: $276.

**Rent/Utilities:** My portion of Rent and utilities comes to about $600 a month.

**Food:** $280/month

**Insurance:** $250/month

**Gas/Travel:** $150/month

**Income:** $600/week if I get a full 40 hours. Usually do.

**Savings:** Nope. Hoping to start.

**Why I'm in so much debt:** No one likes a sob story. Life's just been weird, and I've acquired a lot of debt. Working on it.

**The point:** So, the main thing I'm struggling with right now is if/how I can get a consolidation loan. I'd like to do what I can to eliminate some of the higher interest balances and get other cards down from being so close to their max. However, with my credit, it's been a struggle to find anyone that will lend. 

~~Today I was approved for (have not accepted yet) $2500 for going directly to credit cards, at 35% interest though, at $112/month for 37 months. I crunched and even if I paid just $150 a month, that would reduce the interest and time considerably to 24 months. My thought process (if I take this loan) is to pay off cards #7, 8, and 9, and then pay off $200 on each of 1-5.~~ **edit:** I do know this is much higher than the credit card interest rates, but I wanted to see if maybe I was missing something. Turns out, I'm not. It's just a shitty interest rate. /u/sleepyguy22 helped shine the light on that one.
 
**tl;dr:** Links or resources for someone in my poor credit standing to get a decent loan that can help me reduce my debt would be so helpful.",finance,1407355019
personalfinance,paying off debt. Pay myself or not?,"I could not really think of a perfect title to cover this scenario... here goes.

I have about $35k in credit card debt. Half business / Half personal. Too many buy now / pay later scenarios. At least the interest rate is 12.5 instead of 19%.

I have a full time job + a business I do on the side.

The side business is responsible for the debt. That business is doing very well. Approximately $30k a year when I'm motivated to work...

...and that is the problem... and the question...

I find it hard to be motivated to put in long hours in the evening when I know all that money is going straight to the credit card company. I keep telling myself to PUSH ON and pay it off so I can start reaping the profit for myself instead of CHASE Bank.

So, I heard someone say that small business owners always forget to pay themselves first. I have thought about taking 10% of my small business income each time I make a deposit and putting it in a savings to spend on me and my family... something to possibly get me motivated to work.

On the other hand. The entire reason I got in this mess was because I spent money I did not have. So, it seems wrong to do anything other than send 100% to CHASE and suck it up.

personalfinance,Retirement liquidation in a divorce,"I'm in the final stages of a divorce and am closing in on receiving a disbursement from my ex's retirement accounts. I'll be receiving payments totaling roughly $110,000 (pre-tax &amp; penalty &amp; fluctuation; I don't know what's happened to the actual balances in the ~12 months since the balances were locked in) from two accounts. The disbursement amounts were adjusted to cover taxes and penalties for early withdrawal. I have the following debts outstanding:

$40,000 personal loan - family
$8,000 personal loan - friend
~$30,000 HELOC - very low interest rate

The [QDRO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_domestic_relations_order) payments will be in two sums, split roughly 70/30.

A few questions:

* After satisfying the personal loans, which I consider top priority, should I roll over any remaining balance into IRA or other retirement vehicle in an attempt to avoid further taxation?
* In spirit, these funds are completely proceeds from the presumed sale of the family home - I've been under the assumption that I can in no way treat them as such and roll them into my new house with reduced penalties?
* It's my understanding that I'm not required to act on these on any timeline - would it be worthwhile to try to split the disbursements across tax years (i.e. take one in 2014, one in 2015, even if that means waiting X additional months)?

In essence, I'm considering capturing as much of the value of this as I can. 

Additional (possibly) relevant details:

* good credit - 700-720 at last check
* in Missouri
* $60k/year income
* 2 kids, 50% custody
* $170k home, very little equity
* $10k in credit card debt ($4k @ 13%, $7k @ 15%)

personalfinance,We want to buy a house in a couple years and want to make sure we are taking the right steps. Can you help?,"Disclaimer: This is a throwaway account because I am posting all of our financial information. 



My husband (P) and I are saving to buy a house in the next two years and want to make sure that we are doing it right. We live in one of the most expensive areas in the country and are aiming towards a house between $250,000 and $300,000, which will be a quite modest home. I am hoping that you all can tell me if we are on the right track and where we should be putting our house fund as we save. Sorry for the long post. I’ve been lurking on here for a while and tried to cover what I see as the most common follow up questions on these kinds of posts. The following is our financial information.


Salary:


I make $42,400 a year with a 6% raise per year and P currently makes $40,400 but has a really good county job that and is poised to get up to around $56,000 in the next 3 years. In about 6-months, I will finish a certification that will allow me to go for jobs paying between $50 and $60K a year but we are not counting on that. 


Credit:


P has no credit but is working to improve that. He just got a Capital One credit card with a $500 limit and is planning on spending around $170 a month and paying it off in full each month. He also is about to need a new computer and is aiming to buy a mac mini (to replace the 10 year old MacBook Pro he has now) and taking advantage of a 0% APR for the first year deal. My credit score ranges between 750 and 760. 


Debt:


P has no debt at all. I have $30,000 in federal student loan debt. My career only exists in the non-profit and/or government world so I am taking advantage of the loan forgiveness for public service program after 10-years. Because of this, I signed up for pay-as-you-earn and right now pay $122 a month. I also have a car for which I pay $194 a month. I got an unsecured personal loan for $11K for the car with 2.39% interest over 60 months. I am only 5 months into paying it back. 


Savings:


P has none (I know, we're working on it). I have $10,000 in an emergency fund. I currently split 20% of my salary between my emergency fund and my retirement fund (with my employer making a 6% match) but want to start diverting some of that money into a house fund. Our new saving goals are listed in our budget below. My parents are giving us $20,000 for a down payment free and clear and P's dad is giving us a loan of $10,000 at 0% interest to be paid back over 10 years (what a deal!). So we have a guaranteed $30,000 to put down but are saving for closing costs. Of course, we would ideally have 20% but I just don’t see how that is possible. 

Budget (we have just revised the savings section to reflect saving for the house and are putting it into effect this month)


Take Home Pay: $4,890

Total Expenses: $4,794


Rent: $1100 a month (P's dad is our landlord so we are getting a deal) 

Utilities: $210 (average)

Internet: $67 (no cable)

Netflix: $9

Phone: $138 (we are both on a family plan with my mom)

Renter's Insurance: $14

Car Insurance for two cars: $180

Car Loan: $194

Fuel: $200 (although we have been coming in at $30 less recently)

Maintenance: $100 (we have yet to spend in this category but I'm sure we will at some point)

Student Loan: $122 (but will go up each year based on my salary)

Groceries: $600 ($75 a week per person, this includes toiletries and beer and wine) 

Pets: $140 (they have health issues)

Going out: $120 (like I said, we live in an expensive city so on this we go out maybe once a month for dinner and once for drinks with friends)

Personal Care: $100 (medical costs, clothing, haircuts, etc)

Retirement fund: $300 ($200 for me with an employer match and $100 for P with an employer match)

P Emergency Fund: $200

My Emergency Fund: $100

House Fund: $620

Vacation Fund: $100 (we are going to a wedding in Europe next summer! We are also getting some help with this trip)

Future Computer Payment: $80

Miscellaneous expenses: $100 (some examples of where this has gone nieces’ birthdays and emergency travel)


These are just estimates. Some months we are over and some under. If we are under we take whatever is left and split it between the house fund and each of our emergency funds. 


So, how are we doing? Right now, the house fund is going into P's savings account as we try to figure out the best type of account. Any tips on how we can do better? Anything we are missing?

personalfinance,Is this smart? Or incredibly stupid?,"Alright, so, here's my deal:

I currently owe about 1800 on my Credit Card.

I Make about 1600/month after taxes. 

666 for rent

about 150 for bills (Internet/electricity/phone)

so, right now I'm taking 333 out of each paycheck, putting it into an account I never touch outside of paying rent. 

I then take about 75 from each paycheque and put it into my 'bill's account

This leaves me with ~595 in cash every two weeks. this goes towards food/play/etc.

My question is: should I pay my credit card slowly (say, 100-200/month) Or use the majority of my paycheque to pay off large chunks of my credit card and then use my credit card for everyday spending as well (Just use it less)

So I'm knocking down my debt, and then gaining it a little bit by being more careful with my spending instead of chipping away at my debt and spending money from my debit card.

Okay, so it seems it's time to scrimp and save as much as I can. By cutting down a few things, looks like I can pay about... 300/month on my credit card. I'll see where else I can cut costs as well. (I can already see some things. Moving to bus Tickets from a bus pass etc.)

personalfinance,(US) I've got a mess of financial decisions to make within the next 4 months. Please help me make the best one.,"I'll start off with some background information:

I live in an apartment. I have 4 months remaining on the lease.

Both my ~~wife and my cars are dependable and~~ car and my wife's are paid off.

We have $25,000 in the bank.

I have $1,000 in Roth 401k that I'm putting 20% (plus 3% match) into.

My wife and I make a total of about $65,000.

My wife has $26,000 @ 6% in school loans that her parents said they would pay, but now that it is time to pay them, surprise surprise, they aren't paying. joy... The payments are $280 and luckily her parents are giving us $150 per month to help.

Now here comes the hard part. We both desperately want to buy a house. That means I don't want to touch our savings because I see that as a down-payment. Here is what I was thinking.

Refinance her student loans under her name to a lower interest rate. She has ok credit. Then only pay minimum payments and hope her parents will still take most of the payments so we don't have to worry about them.

Then I will have $0 debt to my name. I make $40k-ish per year so I can use my 750 credit to buy a house for about $120k. Maybe then back off my 401k some to about 12%+3% and pay as much down on the house as possible.

So my plan is to secure a job and graduate in May then delay my start date at my first position. Then I will immediately visit Europe with a friend for about 1.5-2 months. I expect to spend $5500.

I'm currently at my second engineering internship, where I make $15/hr. My earnings from the internship (this summer and part-time during school) combined with my parents' bi-annual contribution will just cover the rest of my schooling.

For the last few months, I have been trying to save for this trip, but some family gatherings have eaten through what I expected to save. Come May, I will have about $1,000 in my bank account, which can be put towards this trip. So basically, I'm ~$4,500 short for my trip. 


My question is, how should I finance this trip? If my parents are willing, my first choice would be to lend from them. We are experienced in this so it won't ruin our relationship. I was also considering taking out federal student loan. In both scenarios I wouldn't take more than $5,000.

I'd have to pay the loan part after 4 years (or when I graduate). The conditions are that interest starts 6 months after I graduate @ 3.5% (current rate). Interest rates might increase by then, so lets say 4% to keep it even.

* 6k annual income (same job as I)
 
* ~50k in debt so far (45k student loan, 5k credit card)
 
* lives with me and my parents
 
* wants to go to grad school right after graduating, plans to pay for it by getting a teaching assistant position
 
* 720 credit score (this is what he tells me - is that possible with his debt? I know he is perfect about making payments and paying more than minimum)

personalfinance,Question about paying back a Student Loan when I'm moving multiple times a year,"So I had a thought here recently and just sort of wanted to get some opinion here from other people who may or may have no experience with where I'm at in life.

I'm a 23 year old who's a college dropout and essentially a loosely defined 'self employed entrepreneur'. I'm not trying to go into details and verify x y and z here I just want some outside opinion on something I've been taking for granted apparently all my life thus far.

I made my initial money through the stock market. Then I made my initial wealth by utilizing that capital I had amassed to start my own online businesses. I now live on residual incomes and day trading and quite well at that. I dropped out of college pretty quickly there too as you can imagine having no longer a need for it as I quickly surpassed the income of virtually everyone in my family.

I've been living a pretty 'different' life in that I don't ever maintain much of an address for longer than 6 months, I like to travel with my fiance and see the world. I've gotten new emails, new brokerage accounts etc. Pretty much the only thing that is still valid from my college 'year' and now is my name and social security number.

So... why do I care about my student loan debt again? A mate posed this question to me the other night and it took me entirely off guard because I realized I did have that debt. I've never once used credit in my entire life, I pay for where I live in cash/check, I've bought cars in cash, everything. Even my business was a self startup so it's entirely residual at this point and I never had to take a business loan to get up and running.

So while I 'could' call up the federal student loan and give them all my information and be like 'Hi, Yeah, that default loan you all can't figure out where I am, who I am, what I even do nowadays? Yeah? Well that guy's me so just let me cut you a nice $20,000 check here today over the phone because it's the right thing to do!'

Yeah that doesn't sound really appealing to me so... I want your opinion on it, the loans over 4 years old at this point, in a state I haven't lived in in... 4 years as well. It's just a weird thing... I have no idea what my credit score is nor do I care because I don't use it nor do I ever see the 'need' to. 

So can anyone give me a 'good' reason as to why I should cut this 20k check other than it's the 'right' thing to do? I don't have wages to garnish, I don't own assets to be seized, literally nothing but an LLC and a couple of cars.",finance,1407382232
investing,Looked at bond yields a bit. How exactly does buying/selling them work?,"If you buy a 30 year bond at a price (let's say $1 which is the market price). You get interest every year but do you have to hold it 30 years before you can sell it? If not, and you can sell it anytime, what's this deal with above/low par value that the market value can fluctuate the price of the bond. How can I avoid buying a bond for $1, getting the yield, then find out the market price has plummeted to $0.10 and realize I would have lost money if I sell even with the money from the yield? I suppose that would mean predicting if higher interest rate bonds will be issued in the future. But isn't that difficult to predict?",finance,1407390435
personalfinance,Lows interest rates; should I think about switching banks?,"I am 22 years old, about to start work on a PhD. I currently have ~$25k in my 3 accounts (savings, money market, and checking) at the same bank, a local credit union. My checking and savings accounts are currently at 0.00% interest, while my money market is at 0.05%. I'd had a 6-month CD that I'd been renewing for the past several years, but I finally stopped renewing after the interest rate on the CD fell to 0.05%.

1) Are these rates abnormally low?

2) Do the interest rates fluctuate quite a bit (i.e. might a bank offering low interest rates one year have high interest rates the next year, or are certain banks consistently at the top/bottom?)

3) Should I consider switching banks?

I'm using this credit union since my dad's used it for 30-some-odd years, and I've had an account there for as long as I can remember.
I'm getting an assistantship to attend grad school, but it pays less than $2000/month, and it stings to see my interest be at &lt;$1 per month while inflation is around 2%.

personalfinance,Yet another desperate college grad,"I luckily was able to score a $60k/year job and just started last month. My main concern right now is a car and student loans. I do not own a car currently but will need to in the future. My office is located far from home, but right now I'm training nearby within walking distance until September. Public transportation to my office takes about 2.5hrs and I dont think thats an option (I was originally suppose to be working at my training location but got transferred due to capacity). So I was looking for advice on when/if I should get a car, and how much I should spend on loans.

Here are some more in depth stats:

* My credit score is 500-600 due to student loans and my mom putting some bills in my name that went into collections without me knowing. I'm currently trying to work this out and help on this situation would be appreciated. 

* 34k in student loans.

* No credit cards (I have been declined many due to credit score problem)

* Monthly expenses for rent+utilities should be around $1k.

* SO buys all the food since I pay for the majority rent+utilities. Entertainment is probably around $100/month

* $3k in savings

* $34k in student loans with grace period that started in May. Interest rates range from %3-%6 with some of them already incurring interest.

* My job matches half of my 401k contribution I believe. I am not eligible yet so I havent looked into it that much but plan to max it out.  

* Monthly income should be ~$4k

I am feeling very overwhelmed right now because of my debt since I was looking forward to financing a car (which is where I learned of the fraudulent items in credit score). I looked at financing a $10k used car and the lowest apr I got was %11.5...So now Im thinking leasing might be an option until I get a better credit score. I also thought about buying a car from a private party for around 5k but feel even more overwhelmed since me and my SO are totally alone right now and never owned a car. 

Oh and transferring locations is not an option until next year",finance,1407391167

I kind of wish I had read #4 back in April before getting myself into this. Back in April there was some arguing within the household about cars. At that time my mother was approved for a $30k car loan on her credit. One day she decided to take me and get a car.[url]http://s30.postimg.org/wcdpdw7k1/New_G8.jpg[/url] This is the car I got that day. I am currently paying $391 a month with a 12.9% annual interest rate. I can afford it plus other bills but I don't want to be paying on this for 6 1/4 years, mainly because I don't think I will have this job that long. (I work in a warehouse)

So my question is should I take a couple hundred, say $200-$400 and pay on principle every month, or just keep paying on this thing for the next 6 years? I have insurance and a phone payment and that is it. I just wanted others opinions on this because I kind of got stuck in this situation.

I´m located in Hannover/Germany


So i Deposited some Euros from my German Bank Account to their Bank Account

 which is also located in Germany ( Munich )

I got worried on Wednesday, usually my Deposits hit Kraken.com in not even 24h

 but this time it would take 3 days?

So i logged into my Kraken.com Account, all good.. nothing changed, 

but my Deposit was on Hold.

What does that mean? Without recieving a single notification like Email, Phonecall, or anything like that, 

they just suddenly froze my Deposit without telling me the reason why.

And here comes the weird part. 

This ""Company"" has access about my Deposit, right now, for free!

They can do with my Money whatever the fuck they want.

They can speculate with it and by Bitcoins on their own, invest in stocks, buy land and so on.. 

as long as they pay me back my Deposit if they decide to release it to my Account right? 

**No**, more about this later.

So this is what i first got after Dealing with the Support ticket Formular:

""I'm very sorry about your deposit being placed on hold. Recently, some German banks have been targeted by fraudulent activity. As a precaution, all deposits originating from German banks are currently considered high risk and we have to be very careful. Unfortunately, we can't accept your deposit unless you verify your account to Tier 3 and submit an ""ID selfie."" An ID selfie is a clear photo of you holding your identification card (ID) next to your face. Please note that in your ID selfie, we must be able to see your face and your identification card clearly. Also, please ensure that the ID used in your ID selfie is the same one which you have uploaded to Kraken separately.

To get verified to Tier 3, please go to your account settings and choose Get Verified &gt; Tier 3. Tier 3 will require you to upload a valid government ID and proof of residence document (no older than three months). You can upload your ID selfie there as well.

If you choose not to verify to Tier 3 and submit an ID selfie, we can refund your deposit back to the sending bank. Please let us know how you would like to proceed.

We're very sorry for the inconvenience, but this is something we must do to help prevent fraud in the banking system. Thanks so much for your patience, and have a great day.""**

Ok, sounds good and legit.. but wait what is this?

**""If you choose not to verify to Tier 3 and submit an ID selfie, we can refund your deposit back to the sending bank. Please let us know how you would like to proceed.""**

So yea, Let me say this: Kraken.com is FORCING their Customers into sending them very very private

 data and Information about themselfes while they keep YOUR Deposits as a Hostage/on hold 

and meanwhile, speculate/invest with that Money. Your Money..

Other than that, requesting a ""ID Selfie"" for a Service that was free before while holding your money back is against

 the Privacy Law of the Federal Republic of Germany.

So you think ""wait, this is all crazy"" ? yes,but now it´s getting real fun.

As requested i gave them everything, i sold my soul. 

I uploaded my ID Card, ID Selfie and Verified proof of residence where i live. 

Not even 6 hours later after i requested a Tier 3 verification, i got verified. 

That´s good right? No, because i don´t wanted to be Tier 3..


**Like i said, i got forced to do so to get my Money/Deposit back.**

And now it gets real crazy..

I´m Tier 3 verified on Kraken.com, they have my ID Selfie and accepted it.

My Deposit **even after Tier 3 went through** is still placed on Hold, 

they´re not willing to realease my Money through a Chargeback to my Bank Account

 or through just letting me Buying Bitcoins with my Money onto my Kraken.com Account.

Ok.. you might think like me while browsing this subreddit and reading some strange topics 

and storys from others like:


""Yea, it´s just you, its your bankaccount or risk of fraud on German Banks or any random shit blabla""

No, it´s not my Bankaccount - No, it´s not just me. 

And When the Fuck did German Banks become a high risk of Fraud?

After doing some research on this Topic i found that there are many many Customers

 where Kraken.com just suddenly requiered a Tier 3 Verification and an ID Selfie **AFTER**  Deposits 

where made.

Just think about it, there are many many **thousands** of Euros on Hold,

 right now as i speak, on Kraken.com.. 

And they are doing whatever the fuck they want with it.

Not to mention that, i´m very sure, a handfull of Customers will say ""fuck you"" and just leave

 their Deposits on Hold, take the loss but fuck this ID Selfie. Got it?

 This buisness model right now as it is, is a Money printing Machine for them. 

And it needs to stop. Someone needs to stop this! 

It´s against the law, it´s illegal, and it´s unethical.

personalfinance,"My (25m) gf (20f) is struggling to manage her finances as she pursues college and work. Having done so myself I want to encourage healthy habits, how can I help her without seeming demanding?","A little background on each of us (both Americans): 

Me - 25m graduated from a good school with some help from my parents and $20k in student loans.  Worked throughout college as a waiter in a nice restaurant, Chose business as a pragmatic field of study and wound up with a decent job (~$70k salary + comprehensive benefits).  

Her - 20F enrolled in community college classes, both online and in the classroom.  She serves tables during lunch and is a hostess in the evening.  She is an extremely talented painter and works as an unpaid intern in an art gallery.  

Her income is roughly $1200/month, BUT she is paid in cash and I worry that she will be audited if she doesn't report all of her earnings and pay income tax.  I helped her estimated the federal, state, medicare and SS taxes she should be allocating for tax payments, but she has difficulty keeping her budget less than her after tax income.  

To get a rough idea of our expenses: we both live in a city in the Midwest, she pays $150 of our $800 rent, pays $70 a month in car payments to her father, though she rarely needs the car because we live close to her work/school.  She is still on her parents insurance (auto/medical/dental) and isn't required to contribute.  Also, I'm fairly generous in taking her out to meals 6-12 times per month and paying for expensive groceries, so as not to lower my own standard of living, but not burdening her by my taste in food.  

She receives little to no financial support or advice from her parents after turning 18, though they're both loving and emotionally supportive. 

I try to explain time value of money to her, but I have a feeling that she doesn't comprehend what I'm saying.  I push her to finish college in a reasonable amount of time (she wasn't in school when I met her, but she has accumulated about 27 credit hours entering the F14 semester).  She sometimes references her ~35yo aunt, who is pursuing her second degree, albeit in acupuncture, and has significant debt, in saying that she is in no rush. 

What I want to impress upon her is that she should be in a rush.  I would like her to allocate &gt;$2000 this year to her college 529, save enough to pay her income tax, and take 9+ credits each semester.  

I also want her to learn how to manage her own finances, so I'm trying to set up incentive schemes.  For example:
Opt 1. Rent - $200 if college 529 deposit is $0
Opt 2. Rent - $175 if college 529 deposit is $50
Opt 2. Rent - $150 if college 529 deposit is $100

Do you have any other ideas for ways I could provide an incentive for her to practice healthy financial habits?  Our relative social standing and income disparity is frustrating to her and I don't want to shove it in her face.  Frankly, I want to marry this girl as soon as she finishes college.  However, I don't want to wind up paying off unnecessary debt and I would like her to start building some credit (sorry that's previously unmentioned, but it's a secondary concern).  

I'm having a difficult time explaining how she should finance college because I don't see a ROI if she pursues a fine arts degree.  I want to tell her that I don't have a problem with her earning very little money, but I want her to graduate college and be employed in a way where she feels fulfilled (probably art) and respected (not waiting tables into her 30s).  I can't seem to say this, because I don't want her to feel financially dependent on me at this stage in our relationship.  I would like to empower her to make better decisions, but approaching the subject is difficult, because she is quick to give up when she feels that I have superior knowledge of the topic.  

Sorry for the rant and lack of cohesive financial info on my part (I was initially going to post to r/relationships, but I think this post falls somewhere in between).  Please provide advice on what I can do to help her and I will try to provide answers to any questions regarding our financial situation and relationship.

crypto,Is it insecure to encrypt the wrong plaintext?,"Most plaintext must be fed as a string or a binary object to be encrypted.
However, it's often possible to mis-decode the plaintext before encrypting it.

i.e. If it's received as a string in JSON, you often don't know if the string
is an encoded representation (e.g. plain, hex encoded, base64 encoded, etc)

**Example:**

If the message to encrypt is received as ""48656c6c6f"" (which is ""Hello"" in hex),
it's possible to accidentally encrypt ""48656c6c6f"" instead of ""Hello"".

When you decrypt, you'll get back whatever you started with, so it's easy to
never know you are encrypting incorrectly.

This results in a plaintext input where the variation per-byte is very small.
If you accidentally encrypt ""01001000"" as an 8-byte string instead of a single
byte (0x48, 'H'), then each resulting ciphertext byte is the result of only
one of two inputs: '0' or '1'.

**Question:**

* Is it INSECURE to make this mistake? (ignoring the issue with different length outputs)
* Is the ciphertext somehow easier to break because you used the wrong plaintext?
* What if you make this same mistake with the KEY instead of the plaintext?

I've just turned 28 and have it under control now, but realize a lot of my peers have a relatively new (in the timeline of personal finance) dilemma: pay off student loan debt or contribute to their employer's 401k?


It didn't occur to me until a few years after I had graduated that student loan interest up to $2,500/year is deducted as [long as you are within certain income brackets](http://taxes.about.com/od/deductionscredits/qt/studentloanint.htm).


In addition, capital gains and income are not taxed in your tax-advantaged account.  So on the margin, investing $1 in a 401k or paying $1 toward your debt is a comparison of whether the expected return in your 401k is greater than tax-adjusted loan interest rate.


For example, for a loan charging 5% per year, if your marginal tax rate is 25%, this is effectively 5% * (1 - 25%) = 3.75%.  Over the long term you should be able to beat this with simple index funds.

I have **~$325,000** in school debt. Went to expensive schools, made some bad decisions, but I have a masters degree and I'm about 1 year into a job earning 50k/yr. The breakdown is as follows:



Sallie Mae Private Loans:

$25.7k @ 13.25%

$19.5k @ 7%

$17.8k @ 4.75%

$34k @3.75%

$11k @ 1.62%

Other private loans:
UAS - $37k @ 6%

Perkins - 11k @5%

             1.8k @ 5%

I'm currently making payments on all of these and focusing on the 13.25%. But I have quite a few federal loans all on IBR with $0 monthly minimums through Feb 2015. They are as follows:

111k @ 7.9%, 3 Direct loans

$34.5k @ 6.8%, 7 different loans (from 1.3k to 8.5k)

$6.75k @ 6%, 2 loans

$4.5k @ 5.6%

8.25k @ 4.5%


So, I'm currently not paying anything on my federal loans, I'm throwing all my income at the 13.25% to get as low as possible before these DO kick in. I will be using my 2013 taxes to re-apply for IBR in Feb, and I only earned about $17k in that year, so I'm hoping it'll be fairly low monthly payments. 

I take home just over 3k a month. My private loans alone require about $1,100 a month minimum payments. I'm adding an extra $300-$400 to the 13.25% loan and that's about all I can afford for the time being. (My rent is $750 - NYC - and the rest is tied up in other expenses). Every day that goes by, I'm $65 further in the hole, and it's wearing on me. I've only been making payments for about a year, and my debt is 6.5 times higher than my income. I tried to consolidate with SoFi but they rejected me. I'm assuming I'll get that from most other places as well. 


tl;dr - Been paying for ~1 year. My loans are a huge burden. Paying on all private loans now, but ignoring federal for the time being. 


What I need to know is, should I try to start making payments on some of my federal loans? Or is it better to continue throwing all I can at my highest interest loan and then focus on others when it's down to a reasonable size/eliminated? Am I overlooking a better strategy?

personalfinance,"Wondering if I should switch banks, get rid of my savings, or if I shouldn't make any changes.","Hello. So I'm about to start my Sophomore year at a Community College. I'm debt free and plan on staying that way until I get to a university. Last year I rented cheaply with my ex and his roommate while I was on the schools payment plan. I couldn't complete my FAFSA so I didn't have many options. I ended up being awarded a scholarship late Spring which I used for my summer class and put the rest into savings. Right now I have almost 7k in savings and I'm being awarded a grant that will cover my tuition and most of my books. I have a credit card that I use but pay in full.

I put $75 into my savings from each paycheck, partly for saving purposes and partly because its harder to spend that way. But my savings has a really low interest rate on it, I think. My statement says its annual percentage yield earned 0.01%.

Over the next year I plan on padding my savings more and when I get to university using most of it to cover costs so I can avoid loans. I don't know if I should move my money into another bank or just wait it out.

personalfinance,I feel like I'm drowning over here,"So, it turns out, I'm not very good with money. I'm trying to do better, but I feel a bit overwhelmed at times. To give a little bit of background:
I'm 34 and I currently make $60K a year.

* $30K in student loans (had to defer a few times when I graduated and didn't have a job)
* $11K personal loan from consolidating some credit cards about a year ago.
* $19K car loan (Needed something reliable/good gas mileage for my 100mi daily trip to/from work.
* $4K in current credit card debt 
* $850/month in rent, utilities and misc. 
* $400/month in groceries. This is for 2 people and I try to pay the bulk of the food bill. My fiancée doesn't make as much money and has enough debt of her own to contend with.
* $160/month in gas

I recently started investing in the 401K my company provides. They match 50% up to 6% so I contribute the maximum to that. I have approx $1000 in savings and try to set aside a few bucks automatically each pay period.

Things were much worse about 2 years ago and I have spent a great deal of time trying to get myself back on track but I still feel like I have a long, long way to go. I've started to go as far as selling some items to pay down some of this debt, but it always seems to barely scratch the surface. 

I've thought about selling my car and getting something cheaper but I'm not sure that will fix any issues or just bandage them for a while. Getting a second job is a possibility but I'm already gone almost 12hrs a day from just one job. 

I know these things take time, and maybe all I need is a little encouragement, but if anyone has any thoughts about what my next move should be, I would be most appreciative. 

Edit: Since it came up, I'll break down my other expenses:

* Car loan is $405/month @ 1.99%/60mos
* Personal loan is $371/month @ 9.99%@48mos
* Student loans come to $520/month with varying interest rates and terms. One loan is roughly $11K and was a personal loan @ 10.49%. I pay a little extra on that each month and pay the minimum on the govt. loans.

* Rent is $525/mo
*Gas,Electric,Cable/Internet,Water is ~$175/mo
* The other $100 are things like Netflix and money for the vet, dog food, etc for our dog. I just rounded that figure for ease of simplicity.

Car is worth maybe what I owe currently ($19K) if I were to sell it privately. The only downside is I rack up almost 27K miles a year so the value just doesn't hold year to year.",finance,1407440767

2. What if it means that the principal will not be touched in some of the lower interest rate groups? (assume no capitalization)

I use credit cards each month, which I typically pay off at the end of the month for the rewards points structure to try and take advantage of this. (I usually get back 50$ every couple of months, which is nice when I have no interest charges.) That all being said, I have a current balance on my cards. My question is, should I wait for my card to be at 0$ balance before applying for the consolidation and/or refinance, or does it really matter that much?

I received a 1099-misc detailing the payments they had made to me. I used turbotax to file last year's federal and state returns, which cost me about $80.

My question is this: I followed turbotax's instructions for the 1099-misc and the tuition information my school sent to me, but I didn't feel very secure that I had reported everything correctly. Is it worth it for me to invest in a CPA? About how much would it cost to have a CPA file my taxes if I do go that route?

Also, should I be making quarterly estimate payments as if I were self-employed, or just pay the lump-some at the end?

personalfinance,"Medical school, loans, the military, and a trust -- what do?","I'm hoping I can get some neat ideas from you Personal Finance gurus! I'm just starting as a medical student in a school that is really expensive -- by the end, I'll probably have borrowed $275k-$300k of federal loan money. That is, if I take loans. I also have a modest trust left to me after a family member died that can just about cover all of medical school.

**Car Stuff**

*What I Need a Car For*

First thing's is first. I need a car ASAP. It gives me the option of living in less expensive housing not near the Cal-train (I work in Palo Alto). I also want to go surfing in Santa Cruz, snowboarding in Tahoe, and camping in the mountains on the weekends when I'm up for it. I've never owned a car. In fact, I just got my full license a couple days ago (had my learner's permit for years, though). 

*What Kinds of Cars I'm Currently Considering*

I feel like maybe I should get a beater, but there's probably hidden maintenance costs involved. Maybe a used 2009 Prius (~$11k, 45 mpgs) or a hybrid 2010 Ford Fusion (~$15k, 38 mpgs)? Maybe a 2008 Lexus RX-400h (~$18k, 25 mpgs) for the roominess and extra space (cramped camping trips suck). I grew up kind of poor compared to everyone I went to school with and think it would kind of nice to have luxury car (stupid, I know; for a brief second I was thinking about buying new or getting a used 2008 Porsche Cayenne). Anyways, I'm looking at those cars primarily because of their excellent repairability ratings combined with good reviews.

*Car Questions*

How much can I afford to spend on a car? What kind of car do you guys suggest (doesn't have to be one of the ones I'm looking at)? Also, how should I pay (finance or borrow money from family for a pure cash buy)? What kind of insurance can I expect in California as someone who's been licensed for &gt; 3 years, at least via learner's permit, and never had a traffic violation (I can't find clear answers anywhere)? I'm kind of nervous about spending money I don't have on a car while I still don't have a reasonable emergency fund set up, but the fact is I need a car ASAP.

**401k/IRA stuff**

I'd like to also max out my IRA/401k contributions for 2013 but I don't start work until early September. Would borrowing some short term living money from my parents, who recently came into some via inheritance, be kosher?

**Student Loans stuff**

Finally, should I just pay off my student loans ASAP at that interest rate? My loans can be paid off as fast as I like.

personalfinance,Married and earning well but don't know where to prioritize putting our money.,"We are both in our early forties. We have paid off our cars. My wife has a student loan debt of 120K at mixed interest rates with the lowest being 7.75%. We have a mortgage with 530K remaining at 4.5% and no PMI. We have no credit card debt. 

We earn a little more than 300K gross per year combined. We maximize our 401K contributions with no employer match and we do a backdoor Roth IRA contribution starting this year.  We have three months of emergency fund and about 200K in the 401k accounts.  We didn't save more earlier because we were saving for a down payment on a house and took care of my parents for six years.

Where do we go from here?  I want more saved as a percentage and her student loans paid off.",finance,1407469939
personalfinance,Need some advice on paying down/off a lot of debt,"Ok, looking for a bit of advice here, and I’m sorry if this gets long. At the beginning of September, I’ll be receiving about $25,000 from the sale of a house that was placed in my name when my grandparents passed away. Normally I’d just put it all in our checking account and let it just sit there, maybe pay a couple things off, but I really want to get out of some debt. Because we have A LOT of debt. Staggering really and it gives me a headache to think about. I’m trying to figure out the best way to go about paying things off, or paying things down, or really what to do with the money. 

We’re moving in December when our lease is up to a different area of town, so I want to leave enough to pay for deposits and general moving costs. Also, I want to have enough of a buffer in case something comes up – emergency, car issue, etc. So I’d like to not have someone say that ALL of it should go to things. 

As of right now, our really awesome debt looks like this:

Credit cards – $11,000 – ish (equals about $350 a month with just minimum payments)
Cars - $10,000 between the two ($500 a month, and they are absolutely necessary for our jobs, so we can not get rid of one of them.)
Student loans – I have about $30,000 on mine thanks to my brilliant decision to go to a for profit art school when I was younger. Right now I’ve been able to get the main payment to $150 a month based on income (I was laid off at the beginning of the year, and so far have only found part time work). The private loans are deferred until Jan ’15. I believe my husbands loans are around $20,000 or so, but they are all in deferment. 
Paycheck overpayment $6000 – Back in 2012 my husband worked for the state, and was laid off. They continued to pay him two extra paychecks before stopping, and honestly it was a misstep on my part as I never caught it. We were having to go back and forth to Florida a lot as my grandma was getting really sick at that time, so my brain was somewhere far far away.  When they called to set up repayment, my husband was out of work and told them he wasn’t able to pay anything now, but he would keep in contact and set something up when he was able. Well, they didn’t do anything, and next thing you know we got a collection letter from them. Figures. 

Anyways, that’s what we’re at. I had initially thought of paying off the cars to free up the $500 a month, but then I got to thinking, since the rates are so low, while the $500 would be good to free up, the credit cards have much higher interest rates. But do we pay them off completely (as it should be a no brianer, our credit is for shit), or just some of them, and then pay some down? We don’t have high balances on any of them – the highest limit is 2k, but we just have a lot of them. I have no idea what to do about the student loans. If there was one thing I wish I had while in school was a finance/how to manage your damn money class, so I would have figured out not to ever deal with SallieMae, and go to school when I could pay out of pocket for it. 

Anyways, hope that wasn’t too long, but some advice on how to proceed would be helpful so we can start getting some of this debt gone.",finance,1407471187
personalfinance,Please help with budgeting,"Long story short, I just graduated from my university and have started my career. I am not in in deep financial trouble, but I know that I will be making a lot of life decisions within the next 4 months and would like some help creating a budget. I am also using a throwaway because one of the reasons that I need a budget is because I plan on proposing to my girlfriend of three years at Christmas and she cant find out.

Some facts about me:

I work as an accountant (regular dry cleaning and travel) and make 50k a year before taxes. (One fact about accounting: Taxes and balance sheets are completely different than personal finance. Sure, I can understand business transactions and taxes like the back of my hand, but I suck at choosing what to invest in and making budgets. They are a completely different monster to me.) After taxes, I expect to bring home a little over 3k per month.

I currently live with my parents so I have no rent payments right now and do not have a cell phone payment (They pay for it, but I work around the house for them). I pay for $10 parking every day for work (P.S. if it is for work and not reimbursed, you get to put that on your tax forms. Keep good records!). I plan on moving out in November to an apartment. Rent around here is around $700-$800 for an okay apartment. I like not having a rent payment, but busy season is coming and my 45 minute - 1 hour commute will not be feasible when I have to get to work at 7am and stay until 11pm.

Debt: 

* Student Loans: 35k (No private, only federal subsidized and unsubsidized) @ around 7% interest - The payments will be $248 starting in November and will increase every two years.
* Credit Card 1: 1.6k @ around 19%
* Credit Card 2 1k @ around 19%
* Car Lease Payment: $486 per month (My old car was paid off but it was falling apart and wasn't worth the cost to repair. I plan on purchasing the car at the end of the lease so I am essentially spreading the payments out over a longer period than buying outright. I also am avoiding the sales tax and other costs that come with buying a car in my state.)

I have health insurance and car insurance of $200 per month (combined). I also signed up to have 10% of my income put into a 401k, which you should be happy to know is a Vanguard.

There is also another credit card but that is for business use and I am reimbursed for those expenses. The balance is always kept at $0. The card with the balance of 1k is a travel card so I can earn miles. All of my other expenses (including car payments) go through my travel card first so I can earn more miles. I plan on using the other card only for emergencies once it is paid off.

The engagement ring I am considering buying is around 5k. I will have financing for it and will pay 40% down, and make regular payments at 0% interest for 12 months.

I know enough about personal finance from browsing this subreddit that I should get those credit cards paid of as soon as possible. But I would really like a simple listing of how much money I should put towards everything, both before I get an apartment and after. My priorities are to start paying off my debt and buy an engagement ring. I really want the student loans to go away within the next few years. If I make the basic payments, the payments will increase to over $750 per month during the last two of the ten year repayment plan.

Both my wife and I have been with Bank of America on separate accounts for several years now, and we haven't really had a lot to complain about.  Recently I received a notice from BoA that my free checking from Campus Edge (from when I was a student) is finally lapsing and they want to charge $12 per checking account per month, and I don't want to do that.  I'm considering switching to a credit union but I'm not sure.  

My previous way of banking for my own personal methods is like this:  I have two checking accounts and a savings.  My direct deposit is a 90/10 split between the secondary and savings respectively and I manually move money not budgeted for important bills like rent, car payment etc that are steady every month into my primary checking.  I only carry the debit card for that checking account and a few credit cards so that I never accidentally spend into my important bill money.

My questions for you are a) Is there a national bank that is more worth going with than a credit union and why/why not?  b) Looking forward to buying a house in the next few years, would a credit union membership be preferable?  c) Estimating a combined credit card debt of 7-8k mostly from wedding expenses and a few months of unemployment when the emergency fund ran out, would a personal loan be preferable in my case over the majority of the cards that have ~17-22% interest rate.

Starting the job I had about $1k in savings, $48k in student loans, and almost $6k in a retirement fund, which I rolled over into my employer's 401k.  
My current standings are:  
Checking account $2400  
Savings account: $500  
HSA: $2380   
401k: $27k  (maxed it hard for the end of last year to get match, already received full match of 50% of my first $7400 this year)  
Roth IRA: $3100 (opened early 2014 with 2013 contribution, no contributions yet for 2014)  
TD Ameritrade brokerage: $3500 (down $1k on a couple stocks, naturally - should probably give this up until loans are paid off)  

And the student loans!  
$18k at 3.25% and $19k at 6.25%  

I have been prioritizing the 401k because of the tax advantage. I don't really see a whole lot of savings from paying the loans much faster because I can't deduct the interest anymore with my income ($94k plus up to 10% bonus). I try to be pretty diligent about budgeting but I live in the SF bay area and everything is a zillion dollars. Because I am both paying off debt and saving I like to use mint to track my net worth as a rough proxy of how I'm doing. I've gone up from -$40k to about $2k now, so I'm close to saving 50% of my gross pay. It sounds like a big fraction but can be frustrating to watch that number grow so slowly.  
For the rest of the year my plan is to try to contribute another $3-5k to the Roth so I can access some lower fee funds, and throw some extra at the higher interest rate loans.  
I felt like I was doing ok and making some decent progress but I started trying to find data on average retirement savings at different ages and found that I'm about $200k behind people who started work in their young 20s and contributed earlier.

My income is going to be increasing by 1500 dollars a month when I go to school, so I can pay down the cards then, but I can't use that income to get another car loan since the GI bill is not able to be used as proof of income when getting a loan. My only hangup with buying a cheap car is that I have only dealt with a used car one time in my adult life, and the maintenance was a nightmare. So, Reddit, what do you think? Sorry if this post is jumbled. I just got back from walking my dog home 7 miles because she was sprayed by a skunk on our evening walk and I didn't want to put her in the car, so I am pretty tired.

personalfinance,(Long Rant) First World Problems: why do I feel like I’m poor?,"I am feeling resentful about my financial situation.  I earn a decent salary ($70,000/year) at a job I love, but I always feel broke. 

I pay 11% of my pretax paycheck into a public retirement system, pay the same amount into a personal tax-sheltered 457 retirement plan, and pay $120 into an HSA. 

My take-home pay is $1,475 every 2 weeks. $550 of that paycheck goes into a joint checking account which I share with my SO. We live together and split the costs of all of the basics: mortgage, utilities (electric, water, gas, phone, and internet), groceries, and pet costs.  We pay $550 from each biweekly paycheck into a joint savings account to cover: mortgage, utilities (A/C, water, gas, trash, phone, internet), groceries, and dates (occasional movies, dinners out, museums, camping, and overnight trips). 
I allocate the remaining $925 of my paycheck according to a strict budget. I put away $700 of that money into savings: $200 to a rainy day fund/emergency account (which I dip into for car repairs, unexpected medical or vet expenses, etc; the balance fluctuates quite a bit, but I keep about 6 months living expenses in there), $300 to my travel fund, and $200 to my house repair fund.  The rest of the money ($450/month) gets eaten up by gas costs (~$200/mo), student loans ($125/mo), and car insurance ($60/mo).  I get my haircut once a month for $16. And I spend the last $50 on an occasional lunch, drinks, concerts, museums, or movies with friends and co-workers.  

I haven't gone shopping for new clothes in years. I don't party. I don't gamble. My one indulgence is travel (carefully budgeted, planned, and paid for in cash; often involving stays in cheap hostels). I always feel like I'm on the verge of a financial disaster - because I am. And I'm afraid to spend any money.  I live like a broke student, but I'm a 30-something professional. 

I live in a little (850 sq. ft.) run-down house in a modest neighborhood halfway between my job and my SO's job.  It’s a fixer-upper and it’s barely habitable.  I saved 25% for a down payment, got a conventional mortgage, and purchased the house in 2010 (for more than it’s worth now at interest rates higher than they are now).  I’ve been fixing one thing at a time, paying cash, for over 4 years, but the work isn’t done.  I don’t know if the end is in sight because every time I think that I might have the chance to actually make a dent in the renovations, something breaks.  Last year, I had to replace the A/C unit.  This year, I’m going to have to fix/replace the roof.  In the meantime, I only have half of a functional kitchen.  As a result of the construction, I’ve been living out of boxes for 4 years.  I have no furniture (other than a bed to sleep on, and a table and a few chairs to eat and work on).  I can’t enjoy living in the house yet.  I can’t have people over because it’s embarrassing that it’s always a construction zone and guests can’t even have a seat.  I tried to sell and I tried to refinance, but I can’t do either because I owe more than it’s worth (despite having paid extra toward the principal for the last 4 years). I owe $152,000 on the mortgage.  The interest rate is 4.99%.  I pay an extra $200/mo toward the principal.  I should have the house paid off in 17 years (9 years ahead of schedule in 2031). 

I have modest student loan debts.  I graduated undergrad and graduate school with $24,000 in federal subsidized loans.  I have $17,000 left to pay off at a 3.75% interest rate.  I earn “too much” relative to the student loan to take advantage of public service loan forgiveness, income based repayment, or income contingent repayment.  It will be paid off in 2030. 

I have no consumer debt.

I drive a 12 year old car with 125,000 miles on it that I own outright.  It’s still running fine and I have no plans to replace it for another 100,000 miles. I need it for work because I need to drive up to 30 miles between offices and buildings regularly. 

What the hell am I doing wrong? Why am I living like a broke student despite earning more than most Americans? Why don't I feel like I have any real assets or material comfort to show for all of my work? Why does everyone around me seem to live better than I do? Finally, is there anything that I can do to actually improve my standard of living (besides selling my house, getting a new job, or selling my car)?

**EDIT:** Two person income, no kids

**This is the monthly overview: **

**This is the joint account and budget:**
We both contribute $1,100/mo to a joint account.  The total $2,200 joint account looks like this:

$1,300 for housing: 4.99% mortgage (property owned by me), property tax, and home insurance are $1,100; extra $200 to principal.

$100 for family phone plans.  SO needs a reliable and unlimited data phone service for work, so Ting is not an option for phone service.  

$90 for internet.  There's only one provider available and they gouge as much as they can.  Again, SO is an IT guy for a private company and needs fast reliable internet.  Tethered phones and mobile hotspot devices won't cut it.  

$200-$400 for utilities. Arizona is HOT.  We don't use much A/C (keep the house at 82), but it costs around $250/mo to do so in the summer (and that's much lower than my friends and neighbors).  Gas: $40. Water/trash/sewer: $60. Flood irrigation: $40.  

Remaining $110-$550 for groceries, household supplies (toilet paper, soap, etc), dog food, and dates.  We usually save during the winter months and use the savings to give us a little more leeway during the summer (May-November) when utility costs are very high.

**Personal account and budget:**  $1850/mo income. 

$125 student loan repayment.

$400 into emergency savings.

$600 into vacation savings. (Some people say this isn't savings because you save savings and don't save to use... what do you suggest I call it?)

$400 to house repair/remodel savings.

$200 for gas.

$60 for car insurance.

$16 for haircut.

$50 for miscellaneous expenditures.


**A note about how long I've been saving**

The savings part is pretty new to me because I was married for 5 years (ended about 5 years ago) and earned less money.  My spouse did not work, but went to school.  I paid everything in the joint account on my salary and had small savings, which often went to pay school tuition.  After my divorce, I still paid for all of my living expenses on my own and tried to save for house repair.  I've only been saving aggressively for the last 14 months after my SO moved in with me and freed up a lot of my money by paying rent.  

SO doesn't pay for the cost of the house repairs and maintenance because he doesn't own the house.  He earns less than I do.  And his fixed costs are higher than mine (he financed a car years ago, took out more student loans, etc).  To a degree, I'm subsidizing his lifestyle (which is far from extravagant but allows him to save, pay off debts, and travel) because he doesn't have as much dedicated savings.  To another degree, he's subsidizing my assets by paying rent toward my mortgage.  It's not really unfair to either of us.  And we're both comfortable with our arrangement.  

As a result of prior years' paycheck to paycheck lifestyle, the savings balances aren't very high.  And most of the savings are allocated to specific future expenditures.  This is the part where I'm really struggling.  How much money in the bank is enough to be able to dial back and spend a little more on frivolous things?  

**About Retirement Savings**

11% goes into a pension account which does not pay very much unless I stay for 28 years.  If I move jobs within the next 5-10 years (which is likely), the pension will replace 21% of my wages at the time I left public service after I retire in 25 years or so.  This translates to about a $500/mo stipend.  Factoring in inflation, that's a drop in the bucket and will be worth about $150 of today's money in 30 years.  If I stay and work for 28 more years, then the pension will replace 70% of my wages at the time of retirement.  

Social security will pay approximately $1,438 in today's dollars if my salary remains the same.  

So, in order to retain my standard of living ($3,000/month costs) when I retire (after factoring in social security), I need to stock my personal retirement accounts with at least $500,000 within the next 28 years.  I currently have about $65,000 saved in a combination of accounts: a Roth IRA with $25,000, a 457 with $40,000.  

According to every retirement calculator that I've seen, I'm falling short.  It's mysterious to me.  And I'm kind of panicked about it.",finance,1407476811

personalfinance,401k contribution vs paying of student loans,"Okay so I make $3,900 biweekly (before taxes and recently started job in July, 2014). This past paycheck I contributed 15% to my 401k plan (no match from employer) and made $2395 after taxes. I have $24,000 in student loans (three different federal loans interest rate ranges from 5-7%). I want to invest in my 401k (max it out by contributing 38% each month so I reach the maximum tax-free contribution by December). Only thing is if I do that, I can only pay ~2300 towards my student loan after expenses each month (which means it would take me 11 months to pay it off). So I was wondering does the tax-free benefit of putting money away in a 401k (i.e. maxing it out) outweigh the benefit of paying my student loan off first?",finance,1407483878
investing,Thinking of Investing very low interest student loan that is not needed. Need advice!,"Hello everyone, 

Perhaps this is a very stupid question but I would like to consider it as a possibility at least with all of your opinions. I am a canadian (Ontario) student, completed my undergrad education and going to start law school this September. I have been approved for both OSAP loans as well as Scotiabank's professional student line of credit as OSAP does not provide enough to cover tuition, let alone living costs. 

The PSLOC is prime+0.5% annual interest rate, charged monthly on every dollar i use only. I have access to about 33K from my line of credit each year, from which I would require at most 20K after all of my expenses. I was considering on perhaps investing that extra 10-15K that I will have access to from my line of credit if I can get a higher return % than the interest rate of 3.5%. Would all of you recommend for me to invest money from my line of credit? More importantly, Is it possible or likely to get a greater return % than my 3.5 interest rate that I would have to pay to use that money? I am extremely new to investing but this thought has been nagging me for a few weeks now and I figured I would ask all of your opinion before spending more time researching it.",finance,1407485401

dogecoin,"Long time lurker. Would really like to reach out finally. I'm the owner of www.dogecoinswag.com, and a Shibe since a few months after Dogecoin's creation. Please hear me out!","From Toronto good morning all,

For one second, I want to preach about Dogecoin. This place changes lives. It's a runaway force, predominantly driven by selfless people. I've watched the pains, and witnessed the highs. It always bounces back because we don't give up.

I believe it simply comes down to having the patience for eventual adoption, like with all innovative ideas throughout history. The Cryptocurrency community is full of those willing to take a bit of risk on something that could truly be an/their anchor in the long run.

For example, my long lost brotherly friend is currently installing a Bitcoin ATM machine into a prominent Canadian University, while he runs Miners and works at his 9-5 job.

This year I wined and dined my Dad seeking investment money to match the three to five thousand I was willing to sink into graphics cards that was coming eventually (great lunch, nothing really came from it though haha).

I believed in Cryptos when I first learned about them and eventually Dogecoin became my own personal home of all the Altcoins. Sorry to get all sappy and stuffff, but I can feel the spirit and faith in Dogecoin from so many of you. In the physical sense, I believe we are a collective conscious that cannot be destroyed for as long as the Internet exists. However the intangible is something of a credo that so many on here follow naturally. Kindergarten stuff like 'don't do harm to your fellow Shibe' and 'take care of your fellow Shibes.'


To be honest, I have gotten caught up with a new event management company and don't have the time to take on all these goals I've thought about a long time for Dogecoin and Cryptos as a whole.

One night the idea of creating a clean simple shopping site that aggregates everything from custom Dogecoin merchandise you find on variation sites like ""Etsy"" (search those Crafty people out there trying to earn a buck and use www.dogecoinswag.com to increase their traffic/revenue) to professionally made stickers, stuffed animals/plush toys, Dogecoin/Doge icecube trays, tshirts, rugs (wut?), bottles, skateboards, ANYTHING, as well as other goods we all love to find in an interesting novelty type shops (i.e. lasers to show where we landed on the Moon) that people can purchase with Cryptos and ""Regular Currencies"". The majority of Cash would be pumped into the Market and essentially buy up bulk as a community. Can you see the cycle?

I was planning on getting started before August 15th when the money finally comes in to try and help finance something like this to get the beginnings in motion.


***Here's where I'd like to somehow offer www.dogecoinswag.com to be a  crowd-surfing site.*** I need an agreed amount of us willing to volunteer and take on an operation like this as I don't know many things with IT, Law, and Manufacturing. I'm hard pressed for time/capital as this event management company is moving pretty quick. Stressful, but a good stress.

Money would be very fairly split with all of you who participate.. perhaps some wage machine like faucet that automatically pays per hour clocked in for hundreds of employees wanting to work (on tasks deemed at the same level.. throwing stuff at the wall here this early), or maybe just some few would rather take this project on. Open to all of your suggestions.

A fair portion of revenue generated from this site will go back to making a brand new faucet that is constantly being pumped as www.dogecoinswag.com hopefully takes off and earns a residual worth. Faucet giveaways would be constant, and the rewards ideally the highest of all faucets.

The other goal would be that I am seriously interested in being the person to get clubs, lounges, bars, festivals, etc. to accept Cryptocurrencies as regular payment. I have quite a few places right now that would certainly entertain the idea if they knew they could generate some new revenue.

Imagine the exposure to Cryptos when people find out that huge bottle service party on the side was paid for in Dogecoin/Bitcoin? When Dogecoin and Bitcoin begin to infiltrate people's R&amp;R time, it will become more and more of something accepted as it really needs some ""cool people"" to call it ""cool"". Sure, let's pay for this Helicopter ride over Niagara Falls with, Dogecoin. 

I'd like to build a club myself that I've designed already and this all leads to it. Of course Crypto would just be the standard in there. Basically I am saying that if you guys help get all of this stuff moving, eventually I could create a place that caters to clients using Cryptos and who knows, maybe it would be the first place if this actually takes off in time before we see that idea become a commonality.

I just came from Dogecoinbeg and after sorting by All-time and Top, posts I sadly noticed that the Beg threads were all fairly similar, and not really any ""grandiose ideas"". Grandiose is often a word that shuts down peoples' dreams. I didn't want to post in there for fear this would get buried. 

Being dead serious and have about 7k+ before mid-August. It would be absolutely fantastic to talk about making what I think could be the home e-store for Dogecoin (Crypto as a whole?) paraphernalia among other goods, with people from all around the world. 

I'm back in the event management type business for the second time now, and my anxiety is going off the wall. The often cruel and judgmental people in this industry got the best of me the first time around. This time around has too much now committed to not face everything head-on, and finally make this passion a reality.

What that random paragraph meant is that, I can't ease your skepticism that I won't screw you over, but I can tell you that I know how it feels to be screwed over.

I finally decided tonight that I'm okay with the potential that by creating this post, I end up having the idea taken. It's worth a shot for the potential of added positivity as I don't have my own the time/capital to dedicate to what a project like this truly needs. So, I invite you to team up with me. Help me do what we are known for and organize www.dogecoinswag.com as a group and we'll ALL grow together.

Have an awesome weekend Shibes, and thanks for all your consideration.

personalfinance,Sinking financially in the very short run. Need some serious advice regarding high-interest loans.,"Ok guys, it's about time I posted here.  Im not the best at money management, and I know it.  But I'm going to get better about it.


So my current situation is that I'm headed off to grad school in September.  and recently, I just broke up with my gf, which screwed me over financially in a few ways. 


1)we had bought a car together (new, since her well-off mother insisted on it)  its under my name though, along with the loan

2)her mother was going to 'gift' us moving expenses for moving across the country for grad school

3)we had a eurotrip planned, also on credit cards under my name, which i got refunds for the tickets, but only partial ones.  lost a good 1300+ there.


My bank account is pretty low now too, since I just had to drop 1.5k to secure my new lease in Boston, where I'll be doing a phd in a science program.  So here's what my account info looks like:


bank account - 100$

BofA - 1.3k/1.4k - 20%  = 34$ min/mo

chase - 4.1k/5k - 15%  = 112$ min/mo

car loan - 23.4k left @ 370/mo

student loans - 23.1k currently in forbearance, will be deferment come september.

credit score is 630 by creditkarma iirc


I'm planning on trying to sell the car back to the dealership since I know I cant afford it alone and its less than .5 years old.



Now my question is this:  when I move out to Boston, I'll be making ~30k in my phd program, which will be enough to live on and start paying my debts off.  For the time being though, I barely have enough money to survive, not to mention to actually move my belongings to the east coast (im in california currently).  I've already got plane tickets, but I'm planning on shipping my things via amtrak since it is the cheapest option out there.


My parents arent really well-off, so I cant rely on them for financial assistance (and plus, being an adult and stuff).  So what I'm currently considering is taking out about a 5k loan at whatever interest rate I'm offered (probably high, since i have several hard credit pulls as of recently, not to mention my debt), and then using that to 


1) ship my things over (probably about 500$)

2) help pay for food/necessities

3) help set me up once I reach boston ($?)

4) pay off bills until my paychecks start coming in


and then, once I get there and am on my feet, I'm going to need a plan for tackling my debt.


After tax, I'm going to be making about 2.1k/mo, of which 700 is going straight to rent. say maybe 500/mo for food, 100/mo for utilities, it leaves me with about 825/mo to pay off what i can.


So my questions here are:  Is there any better solution for the short run other than high interest rate loans that I'm not aware of?  and...can any of you sages help guide me in the right direction for conquering my debt, and paving the way for financial stability?

personalfinance,Is there such a thing as too high of a credit limit?,"I have pretty good credit (roughly 730) and over the last several years, I've opened a few new credit cards to take advantage of 0% interest or cash back deals on big ticket items and have been offered a few credit line increases which I've taken advantage of.  My total credit card limit among the five cards I have is $45,900 while my annual salary is about $64,000.  I am looking to buy a house with my soon-to-be wife next year and at that point will have a low balance on these cards and likely an even higher credit score.  Is it possible that event though my balance is low, the amount of available credit I have could hurt me in either getting a good interest rate or reduce the amount the bank is willing to give us?  I feel like I read somewhere that the mortgage lender assumes that once you've bought a house, you'll go out and max your credit cards out with new furniture and things for the house and therefore they would reduce the total loan amount to adjust for this. If so, would it be a good idea to close an account or ask for the credit limit to be reduced?",finance,1407527160

personalfinance,"Rewards checking: a warning about M&amp;T Bank, and soliciting positive experiences","I think for many of us who are younger and have savings that are in the $5-$15K range, rewards checking accounts seem to offer an possibly good alternative to a standard savings account for short-to-medium-term savings. For example, I have my savings at Ally right now earning 0.87% (i.e. $50/year on $5K), but I could either use that money to go for various checking and savings sign up bonuses (netting $100-$400+ each time) or for an account like [Consumer's](http://www.myconsumers.org/personal/checking/free-rewards-checking.html) that would give me a 4-5% interest rate.

I'm willing to deal with the hoops they make you jump through (direct deposits, using online bill pay, using the debit card, etc) but I was recently burned badly trying to dip my toes into these waters while trying to open an account at M&amp;T for a $150 bonus. (copying this story from a comment I made in a thread here because I thought it would be nice to get wider feedback:)

M&amp;T essentially lied about many terms of their rewards checking, including the fact that I was not actually eligible for the rewards in the first place. It wasn't at all clear I wasn't eligible when I joined and the promo material made it seem like a general offer open to all. After I signed up, different reps told me different things about whether I was in fact eligible, though on balance I became convinced I wasn't in fact eligible and it wasn't worth tying up funds in a crappy bank to find out (one rep who couldn't figure out the answer said ""hey, you can always just leave the money in for 6 months and wait and see if you get it!""). It seems most people who have tried to get M&amp;T rewards have not actually seen the money.

Frustrated about this, I then tried to cancel my account and they told me that I couldn't do it over the phone (the nearest branch was several states away - apparently you can open an account online but have to close in a branch?). I couldn't just leave it open with no money in it because they would charge me $7/month if the balance ever dipped below $500. Also, surprise surprise! There is a $50 early cancellation fee (before 6 months) that is not written anywhere in the account materials online, nor the paper account terms and conditions I later received from them.

Eventually they did cancel the account over the phone without the cancellation fee, after much complaining and hours on the phone. However, the ACH transaction to fund the account was still pending. They promised it would 'bounce back' to BofA since the account would be closed when it came through. In the end, the money *vanished entirely.* TBD whether it was their fault or BofA's or whether the money will turn up (it's been a few weeks now) but given my experience with M&amp;T my money is on it being their fault.

BofA refunded me the $500 when I put in a claim and is now investigating. So I get to do lots of paperwork and hope that no one things I'm trying to defraud someone.

So in the end this adventure was totally not worth it - the rewards I thought I was getting were an easy $150 for opening the checking, keeping a minimum balance of $500, and making one direct deposit, and instead I've wasted hours and possibly am out $500.

On the other hand, I have another reward checking account (with Bank of Maine) that seems to be fine, and they are much friendlier on the phone.

So, I thought I'd post the story to a) warn people off of M&amp;T, which seems to regularly run promotions that people do not successfully see rewards from, and b) ask if people have utilized the checking rewards strategy successfully as an alternative to low rates on savings you want to keep relatively liquid. I don't mind the hoops (I have the ability to split my paycheck to satisfy direct deposit requirements) but I'm much more wary about entangling myself with a shady financial institution now, especially if they have *any* fees, because you can easily end up owing them money that comes to haunt you later after you thought you closed the account. 

Another example of something I'd consider is the Santander extra 20 promotion. For tying up ~$1500, it's an awesome return ($240/year). But the internet has nothing but bad things to say about them as a bank.

So, any similar failure stories, or any informative successes?",finance,1407529267

personalfinance,How to allocate the remainder of a settlement?,"So, despite what my username would suggest, I just came into a decent amount of money - at least more than I've ever had at once - and while I have an OK idea of what to do with it (thanks to hours of reading through this sub - you guys are great) I wanted to run over what my options are and make sure I have the right idea here. Or, perhaps, get some suggestions from outside perspectives.

I am receiving just over $20k - or rather, just received. I have been a very frugal person in the past and have just over three months of emergency funds saved up at the cost of living *without* my roommates, I have good credit (lots of debt imo, ~3000, but still less than 40% utilization) and not much in student loans (less than 10k all sub federal and I am not finished with school yet but will not need to take out any additional loans for my final semester thanks to a new scholarship and grant.) I am already very much in the habit of keeping myself on a strict budget from growing up with very little money and helping my parents get their financial shit together after having to file for bankruptcy.

I am 24 years old and have not opened a retirement account of any kind yet. I know that should be a big priority - however, my main concern with that is, I want to purchase property as soon as I can. Right now, I am very lucky in that I am living in a rental situation where I am renting far less than it would cost for a mortgage for this place every month, but ultimately I know it is essentially money thrown away. Helping my parents purchase their first home and teaching them about the power of equity gave me a lot of respect for the potential that smart real estate purchasing can have. The point here is, if I put my money in a retirement account, I really can't/shouldn't touch it until a certain age, right?

So here are my options. After my car and credit are paid off, my savings further padded (another $2k on top of my already established emergency fund) and my mother's car is fixed (something that is really important to me even if it's not the *best* option financially), I will have $5,000 left over. I currently work for Disney as a Professional Intern and just became eligible for their 401k plan, however, they do not start contributing until 6 months after employment and that is the length of my internship - and I am not 100% certain I will have a position after that, so I don't see the point in going that route. That leaves me with the option of a Roth IRA. I'd be able to make my max contribution by the end of the year, and I'd be able to build a decent little portfolio (which, if anyone has any tips/guides/companies they recommend/etc. please please please throw them my way.) However, that means that even if my money grew to an amount large enough to help me obtain real estate within the next 5 years, I wouldn't be able to/shouldn't touch it. Granted, while my car will be paid off, I am simply going to redirect that $200 a month into my savings, so it isn't like that will not grow past my initial contribution anyway.

Here's the thing. It's important to me that my money grow rather than just sit, especially with a well established emergency fund under my belt. However, it is also important that I have the option to dip into this money for the large purchases I may be making within the next 5 years. My plan would include the remainder of that amount after the next 5 or so years going directly into a retirement account - and that hopefully by then I'd have a reliable employer-sponsored one to contribute to. How different is investing WITHOUT an IRA? Does anybody have a guide or words of advice on where to start with that? 

Also, I am a member of two credit unions - CFE and Fairwinds. Would you guys think they would have any resources for me that I would not otherwise have access to? If you were in my shoes with my concerns, what would you do? 

tl;dr: Will have $5,000 to invest, but not sure about contributing to an IRA versus... traditional investing? Not sure how soon I may ""need"" the money. Still shaky on the differences/processes of both, too.",finance,1407539537

personalfinance,[US] Would my step-father be legally responsible in the case that my mother would be unable to make payments on a Parent PLUS loan?,"I have roughly $8000 left to pay for this school year, and I've exhausted all other federal loans and school grants.

My biological parents are divorced. My dad is unmarried and has horrible credit, while my mother is married and has borderline-acceptable credit.

To compensate for the extra money that I owe, my mother is willing to take out a Parent PLUS loan. She's hesitating, though, because she thinks that, in the case that her financial situation is compromised after I finish school that her spouse--my step-father--will be held liable for the debt. From what I understand, my step-father had his school paid for him (in addition to the fact that he went to a technical school back in the 80s), and he therefore doesn't have much context or understanding of how student loans work today. He thinks that the entire debt would be his after I graduate, even though my biological father and mother have signed an agreement to each contribute 50% of the Parent PLUS loan payments.  I also plan to contribute to these payments as I have very good chances of getting a decent-paying job after school (computer science major), although I understand that it is definitely not guaranteed.

Is it true that my step-father would be held liable, even though there's a signed document stating that my father and mother are to be held responsible first? Are there ways to try and convince my step-father (even though honestly, it comes down to my mother's decision)? Am I looking at all of this completely wrong and/or missing things that should be accounted for?

personalfinance,"When to decide to ditch a credit card, and go for a better one?","I've been wondering about this for a while now. I'm a college student, and I've held a (college) credit card through my bank for a couple years now. I've kept on top of my credit, keeping good track and always paying in full when I use it. Every six months or so, they seem to bump my credit limit.

I was wondering when someone should decide to switch credit cards. I think I've more than proven my credit-worthiness over the years, yet this card still has ~16.5% interest because its a college card. I want to move on to a better credit card, that will provide me with more benefits and have an interest rate that is based off my credit score, but my understanding is that I will lose all my good credit history if I were to cancel this card.

TL;DR -- When does someone decide to ditch a credit card, and the good history with that credit card, in favor for another card with more benefits?

Our finances are messy, mostly because we have no plan or budget. I understand the need and have made budgets before but haven't stuck to them. I'm hoping getting some outside opinons will help.

Quick background: I'm 27, a stay at home mom with 2 kids and one on the way. Hubs is 30 and makes 58k/year at a very stable job. We live out in the sticks so gas and vehicle cost is hugely high, but are renting from family so our rent is amazingly low. Quick breakdown:

Income after taxes:  4200 monthly  
$500 goes in to a separate grocery bank account  
$700 goes in to a separate gas/vehicle account  
For bills: $3000 monthly  
Rent: $400 (3bd house owned by mother in law. The goal is eventually buying it out from her for about $120k but for now we 'rent'.)

Electric: Averages $250  
Internet: $40  
Cell phones (prepaid, 2 lines, we have no home phone): $70  
Netflix + Hulu + FF14: $30

Van payment ($12,000 left): $300  
Car insurance: $120

Our second car is paid off completely. We absolutely need two cars because of our remote area (no public transport) and having children. Hubs drives 45 min, one-way to work every day in a very fuel efficient 2006 Saturn ion (paid off) and I keep the van at home and only drive when necessary.

Now, debt.

CC: $11,000 (we consolidated smaller cards into one a few years ago and have been ticking away at it - 11%-ish interest rate)

Student Loans: $5200 (3.-something????% rate, not sure)

Midwife payment for baby due in January: $2400 (No interest but MUST be paid by January)

Van: $12,000 left, bought used in January 2014, 2005 Honda Odyssey. (Lots of interest. Oh my god, the interest. I wasn't checked with before we signed on to it... I would have never agreed to that high of an interest rate but hubs did and now I'm in love with the damned van and have decided to just eat it)

We have no savings at all. No retirement, no life insurance (jesus that scares me...), no investments. Hubs checks get more taken out of them in taxes than they should so we're expecting a nice $2-3k refund in 2015, but that's it.

So, our goal is to pay off our CC debt ASAP and get the heck rid of it because we're tired of it. The van is next, and then student loans.

Other options: 1) 9.90% home improvement loan at my credit union which I will have difficulty paying with my income and debts (including grad school student loans),  2) cash out some of the few stocks I have and pay taxes on that income or 3) take a loan out of my 403b with variable interest.

technology,Netflix Now Working Natively in Linux (for some of us),"There has been a huge debate about DRM causing Netflix to turn a blind eye to Linux.  Until recently it has required the Microsoft Silverlight plugin to run.  

Linux users are divided about how they feel about the issue.  Most hate the idea of any DRM being built into any standard, but are also willing to use proprietary software if it is the only way to get what they want.

There's been a lot of workarounds and hacks to get Netflix to run on Linux but today that changed.  Some clever Linux guy figured that since the Google Chrome Beta in Windows could use HTML5 streaming that perhaps the Chrome Beta for Linux could also, albeit by fooling Netflix by changing the user agent string to a Windows version.

So I popped open a terminal and installed the Chrome beta from the AUR, changed the user string.  And voila [like magic it worked!!!](http://i.imgur.com/B3IqAIw.jpg).

But the plot thickens.  As it turns out, only Arch, Manjaro and Fedora 20 have been confirmed to work.  

So I decided to package up my known working build and send it off to some Ubuntu users that couldn't make it work due to an error.  Weirdly enough, my known good version wouldn't work on Ubuntu either.

**Here's what bothers me,**  why should Linux users have to change their user agent string into ""fooling"" Netflix, when **clearly the browser is capable of running it?""**  WTF NETFLIX!?  

And what method are they using to block Ubuntu users from doing the same thing **with the identical browser** I just used on my own system that works fine?

Obviously Netflix is detecting something about the traffic from these distros that it cannot yet detect on bleeding edge distros like Arch, Manjaro and Fedora.

**They are purposefully blocking people from using their service, who have a browser capable of running it just because they don't use a corporate sponsored operating system, and quite frankly that pisses me off.**

Edit: Before I jump to too hasty of a conclusion, there is a possibility that something about this HTML5 implementation requires bleeding edge components.  But knowing the history of this and how DRM crazy the industry is, I'd bet that they are actively blocking.",technology,1407611135
personalfinance,Is it wise to open a HELOC to pay off student debt?,"Greetings all!  

Looking for some advice.  My wife has student loans of about $57,000 w/ an interest rate of 7%.  We have about $100,000 in equity in our home.  Someone mentioned that it may be a good idea to open up a home equity line of credit, and then cut a check for $57k to the student loan holder.  That way, the interest rate would be lower, and we'd be able to deduct the interest from both our first and second mortgages.

personalfinance,Coming out of the Debt stranglehold and looking for input on whether to pay off my student loan or invest.,"(Edited for paragraph fixation)

(To skip to the nitty-gritty start reading at the last paragraph)

So I guess let me start of by saying that I used to be terrible at managing my money and have in the last year begun to turn things around at 25 and make some pretty dramatic changes.


It would probably best to start where all of my financial troubles began which probably applies to most people, college.  So I didn’t come from a wealthy family to begin with which meant financing the entirety of my college education on my own.  This became far more costly than I had anticipated.  I was able to get some scholarships and grants to help pay for tuition and then got some students loans to help cover some of the remaining living expenses.  This included rent, food, clothing and transportation.  If I had left it at that then my current financial situation would be much better then what it is today.  However, obviously this is not what occurred.  Many of my friends in school came from families that allowed them to afford more lavish lifestyles footed mostly by their parent’s income.  So foolishly I decided to live beyond my means to match their lifestyles.  


This included:

$900.00 a month in rent in a high rise apartment

$200.00 per month Comcast bill split 4 ways ($50)

$400.00 per month food bill from eating at restaurants and not making food

$100.00 per month cell phone bill

$100.00 on gas per month

$100.00 month avg. on clothes

$1500 Snowboarding trip every year

$500-$1000 on Summer trips per year


All of this while barely working during school and taking mostly unpaid research internships.  These expenses were compounded even more since I spent an extra year in college after transferring majors to a genetics degree.  Luckily I didn’t transfer my spending insanity when I purchased my car and bought a used Hyundai Tiburon when I was in high school for $3k in full that had lasted me through college.  But at the time I justified all of the extra expenses with the notion of “Well once I get out of college I’m going be making $60k to $70k per year starting out because everyone is just going to be lining up to hire me once I graduate.”
Years of living beyond my means had me rack up $41,385.71 @ about 4% interest in student loans and $1500, $3000, and $10,000 in credit card debt (ouch).

Total Debt = $55,885.71 


Not only that, but as you may have already guessed my fantasies of employment had not coalesced as I had thought they would.  After graduating I spent a year working in a pharmacy as a technician making $11 and later $12 an hour with 30 hour per week schedules.  When my loans became due I was able to make the minimum payments to avoid them going into default but my financial situation was going nowhere and was living on PB&amp;J’s.  I needed to make some changes fast and the first one I needed to make was getting a job that I didn’t loath with better compensation.  


Luckily sometimes I can be persistent and I stuck to it in my job applications.  I finally found a job I got through a friend in honeybee research which I absolutely love. This new job left me with a monthly after tax income of $2,156 (based on a two biweekly paychecks.  The 1 or 2 times a year I get 3 paychecks in a month, the third one is a bonus that goes straight to pay off debt).  So with new income in hand the first order of business was to get my spending under control.  This lead to drastic reductions in spending over what I was previously doing in college.  My new spending profile includes:


$450 on rent per month (Cut my largest expense in half at a savings of $450)

$7 internet per month ($50 split 7 ways at my new group house)

$30 Utilities per month ($200 split 7 ways)

$30 Cellphone plan (using Republic Wireless)

$40 Transportation

$250-$300 per month on food (I still need to reduce this a bit)

$400 per month spending money (Gym, going out, short trips and bad consumer purchases). I can still reduce this some.


This leaves me with a monthly savings rate of about $900.  I was even able to turn something that could have been a financial disaster into even more savings.  When my car broke down, instead of taking a loan out for a new car I decided to bring my bicycle out of the closet.  Now, all of my transportation expenses are my $0 per month bicycling expense and about $40 on public transport.   So immediately after having my luck turn around with this new job I began to make large dents in my credit card debt.  After a year of making payments, I am happy to say that I eliminated the $1500 credit card, the $3000 credit card and reduced the last one down to $5000 all while having an emergency fund of $2000 saved up.  Another aspect that has greatly helped me was that after never missing a payment I found my credit score has gone way up to 690!  With this new knowledge I went out and found a 0% APR credit card with 0 transfer fees for the first year and transferred the remaining credit card debt to obtain a reduced interest rate of 0% from 19.9%.  I also have begun to take Master’s Program in Bioinformatics that my work is completely covering so that in the future I can build up in even better salary. So now that the credit card debt is winding down to a close I have begun to make plans on how to reduce my student debt on how to get rid of it.


How to tackle my student debt:


So the first steps I took with my student debt were to enroll in the Income Based Repayment Plan (IBR) so I can make minimum payments and concentrate on the credit card debt.  Also I consolidate all my federal loans into 1 account for easy management.  So this leads me to the question that I have seen come up a few times on this subreddit of should I pay off the student loan or should I invest.  But for me I found a new variable in this problem.  I currently work for the state government and if I continue to work in the public service for 10 years I will be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).  This has led me to come up with the plan of continuing to make minimum payments to my student loans and invest in a ROTH IRA Index Fund through Vangaurd.  My reasoning is that right now the returns on investing are a greater return value than my 4% loan.  But what happens if I change careers and I am no longer eligible for PSLF?  This is where one of the great attributes of a ROTH comes in hand.  If this would occur the ROTH (if I am correct) allows me to withdraw my principle penalty free.  I can then use the principle from my ROTH account to pay off the student loan debt all the while I was making interest off that money.  My other option is to just continue to throw all of my savings at the student debt like I did with the credit cards.  I just wanted to ask r/personalfinance what they think about my new plan.",finance,1407618873

personalfinance,I just unexpectedly inherited ~$20k. I'm very young (23) and I have a lot of student debt. Still in school. Should I reserve some of it for an IRA or feed it all to the sharks? (details inside.),"Preface: yes, I did read the sidebar and the common topics list. I still am unsure how to prioritize, because the ""I have x$, what do I do with it"" list was mostly nonapplicable to my life situation.

So. I'm a medical student with $60k in loans just from my first year. Roughly $40k is accruing at 6.8% and $20k at 8%. I have three years left until it capitalizes, and I'll also be borrowing more during those three years. However, the rest of my loans will be at a lower fixed rate because I found a better deal than direct federal loans.

My initial instinct was to think: there's no way for me to possibly outpace the interest on my debt by investing the money, so I should just cut a check and pay down as much as possible on the higher-interest first-year loans. However, because I'm so far from retirement, I thought that maybe putting some of the money towards an IRA *would* actually be more advantageous - compound interest and all that good stuff.

I'm really terrible at financial math, especially when it comes to trying to compare two separate interest bearing accounts (debt vs IRA).. can someone help me get some perspective? I don't need a detailed analysis - just a general idea would be great. Thanks in advance :)

* If I contribute the max to my 401k, the remainder that I earn will be less than the standard deduction.  Does this mean I will owe no federal income taxes?  If so, can I stop federal income tax withholding?  How would I go about that?

* Now more of a personal question:  I am living in my mother's house rent free.  I take care of the yard, dogs, etc. so she can live with her boyfriend, it is mutually beneficial.  But now that I am able to pay rent, I feel an obligation to contribute.  But she isn't great with money and will probably spend the extra income on frivolous things.  I'd rather the money go toward the house, or into savings.  How would you approach this situation?

* Finally:  Anyone ever regret saving too much money?  I am in the position of saving the vast majority of my pay check.  This would set me up pretty well for the future.

personalfinance,Where do I go from here?,"Hi all,

It's finals week for me, and I've been doing better academically this week than I've ever done before (my depression is slowly clearing up after fighting for about 10 years).

I was doing some math to see what money I would have to work with for Fall quarter (Pell Grant, Fed Loans, Private Loan from Discover, co-signed by a close friend) and I came up with around $250 to last me three months.

This has been stressing me out enough to impact my studying, and I'd like some advice:

0) I have a large amount of credit card debt from my Cost of Attendance not accurately reflecting my cost of living (and a previous Uni shorting my Aid by several thousand dollars). I have my spending under control now, but a fair amount of debt sitting on various 0% offers.

1) According to my school's Financial Aid Office, I receive 100% of my Total Cost of Attendance. They assume that I'm taking 12 credits quarterly, and they refuse to believe otherwise until I've been billed for those credits and forwarded on the proof (two weeks into the quarter).

2) Discover insists that they will pay for my full Cost of Attendance, but can't understand the above, so I receive a smaller amount that barely covers tuition and books.

3) Taking fewer credits would relieve my immediate debt burden, but I can graduate in two years with a double degree at my current pace, and start to repay my loans.

personalfinance,Student Loans: Defer or go into repayment?,"I was hoping to get a rationale check from you veterans about my loan repayment plan. 

So I have about 100k in student loans that are entering repayment in a few months.  7k of that is interest from unsubsidized loans. 

I am in a post-doctoral training program which allows me to defer loans for another year. I'm not sure whether I should do this or start repayment with IBR (I've been told if my loans aren't paid off in 20 years they will be forgiven under IBR, so starting repayment earlier is better).  A quarter of my loans are subsidized so no interest will accrue under deferment. But I'll have 6.8%/5.4% interest rate accruing on everything else. 

So my plan was to enter deferment so avoid paying interest on subsidized loans, then paying the usual 10-year plan monthly loan payments anyway (which would be a large chunk of my take-home pay). 

Does this sound logical? Any other advice I should know (aside from what's in FAQ)? I'm paranoid that I'm missing some piece of information that will make this plan a mistake. Thanks!",finance,1407653425

personalfinance,"A few questions and planning: 401(k) Loan, house after a while, credit boosting?","Hey Folks! Couple quick questions for you guys while I am making some plans.

I have a couple existing 401(k) loans from some rough patches a few years ago, in the amount of ~4300 (2k and 2300). I also have a CC maxed out at 2100 right now. My thought process/plan is as follows:

Borrow $2k from my parents for ~3 weeks

Use 2k to pay off 401k Loan 1, freeing up the availability to take out a new loan.

Take out a new 401k loan for ~4200, paying back my parents and paying off my CC.

My 401k loan interest rate is 4.25%, whereas my CC interest rate is 23%. I'm trying to improve my credit rating and paying it down and leaving it down seems like the best way to do that in the short-term.

Can anyone find any major cons to this plan? I realize taking a loan against a 401k is generally a bad idea, but my thought is to take it out for a 1-year term, and hopefully be able to save up to lump-sum payoff sooner, but in the meantime I'll save the interest on the card...

The goal is to help my credit score. I've got no active collections accounts, my only debt is the credit card and a small ($1200) student loan that I've been paying on consistently. I have a few old write-offs that have seriously hurt my credit but i've been ~18 months in the green (all old stuff is settled/paid) so it's slowly making it's way north again. 

Any other advice I'm missing for getting that number higher short of lowering utilization and keep making payments?

Also, one more quick question: I have a wells fargo CC, when the bill comes out, if I pay it before the due date, I'm not being charged interest assuming I pay it in full, correct?

Two of my past employers provided retirement benefits. One I still have around $600 in a 401k. I already talked to that financial advisor who said I couldn't continue to contribute to it. The other forced me to take a lump sum payout because I had less than $5k in it. 

For a few months, I was unemployed/underemployed so I spent through my $3000 emergency fund. I'd like to start contributing to an emergency fund and a retirement account starting next paycheck. 

In the past, I contributed a dollar for each hour worked. I work around 61 hours/paycheck now so I plan to contribute $61/paycheck to each of these accounts.

My former emergency fund was a savings account on Ally. I was happy with the higher interest rate with this account so I expect to continue contributing to it as I did before.

Now with the retirement account, I'm not sure. I thought about setting up another savings account through Ally, and at the end of each tax year, put that money in Ally's 5 year CD. Then just keep opening CDs as they mature.

I'm starting a job making $46K next week. It'll be my first real job and I'm a bit overwhelmed with retirement strategy possibilities.

The job I'm entering, as well as the general field, has a fairly high promotion and salary growth potential. I'm living at home for the forseeable future, so I'm not paying rent or utilities. I have about $13k in subsidized student loans, a decent paid off car that I plan on driving into the ground, and am interested in retiring earlier rather than later.

I know about a Roth IRA and 401(k) and am planning on maximizing my Roth contribution limit every year. Should I do the same for the 401(k)? Should I focus on clearing my student loan debt (interest rate is ~4%) or should I pay the minimum every month and maximize savings retirement? Are their any other retirment invensement vehicles I should be taking a closer look at?

I have a good credit score (700+) from using credit cards wisely over the years, so I'm not terribly concerned with building my credit.

I don't really forsee myself buying a house in the immediate future as my job and career is travel heavy and I need flexibility to move if better opportunities arise.

My SO are probably marrying in the near future (5+ years) but won't be having kids. He works in education and is equally as focused on maximizing his Roth IRA. He'll also be receiving a pension.

My culture is family focused so I will be providing for my parents in their later years. Currently they have no retirement savings but do own their own home which they'll likely pay off by retirement age.

I assume I need to speak with a professional, but I’m not sure which professional can answer these questions (the limited experience I have with “professionals” suggests many of them are uncomfortable with going “off-script”). Would a CPA, tax accountant, tax attorney, or some guy at H&amp;R Block be able to answer these questions? I don’t want to waste anyone’s time (or spend money) asking someone who doesn’t have answers.
 
Some specifics:
I have 75K in outstanding student loan debt at interest rates varying from 2% to 7%. I’ve reduced that balance 35K in the last 2 years. My monthly payment is approximately $1300.
I have 12K, 6K, and 50K in a 401(k), Roth IRA, and Rollover IRA, respectively (and about 30K in cash).

My income is mitigated by the fact that I live in the most expensive city in the country. I’m lucky to save $1500 a month.

Even if I paid an extra $1500 toward my loans each month, it would be nearly 3 years before I paid them off, and I’m not getting any younger.

personalfinance,Should I buy a newer car and chuck the old one even though I have high student loan amounts?,"Immediately when I got out of high school, I went to an in-state community college for 2 years. My parents aren't in any shape to help me out with my cost of attendance and I foolishly never got any scholarships or grants. I paid my first year off in full which cost around $3,000. The following year I bought a 2002 Ford Escape for $7,000 and have been making payments of $121 for insurance and $120 a month for the loan. Due to taking on this loan, I decided to take financial aid my school offered which covered the cost of my attendance my second year of community college (roughly $3000). 

My third year of college, I transferred to a university where I had to take out a loan of $7000 for my first semester (I got fucked essentially because I lived in the dorms for a week then moved out after realizing I couldn't afford it so the pro-rated cost of my living there as well as my tuition made it that expensive). I took out a Discover student loan at an interest rate of 7.3% I believe. So far on this loan, I'm at $7,253 to pay back. The next semester, I took out roughly $4,000 to pay for my tuition at the same interest rate (not sure what I've accumulated in interest now).

I now transferred to a new university (third school, I'm indecisive i guess) and am taking out more on my Discover student loan for the semester. This university I currently attend is $4500 for tuition but I am taking out $6,000 to cover books and other costs. 

Throughout this time, I've almost completely paid off my car loan. I only have $1630 left and by the time march comes around, I'll have $696 left that I can spend my tax return toward and pay off my car completely. 

My question now becomes, based off my current loan baggage, would it be a good idea to go ahead and get a new car after mine is paid off? The way I see it, my options are to either keep my current car which has quite a few cosmetic issues and some mechanic problems (roughly $1500, shocks, leaks, etc.) Or, I can trade my car in and get a newer (used) vehicle. The trade in value of my car is around $2000 from what Kelly blue book tells me. When I consider a new car, I'm looking to match what I'm paying now. I'm imaging that most people assume that will be hard to do but I say this because a friend of mine owns a 2014 Kia spectra and pays $275 a month including insurance. I pay $241 for my pile of shit  when I can easily afford the extra $30. I have tremendous credit for my age (21F)  and get paid $12.50 an hour in a state where the minimum wage is $8. I usually work anywhere from 25-32 hours a week. 

I'm also curious if anyone has any helpful tips that I should be doing differently pertaining to my student loan history. I have about 2 more years left at this last university at about $12,000 a year if I keep doing what I'm doing this semester. So I believe that once I graduate I will have about $50,000 in student loans give or (hopefully) take.",finance,1407720960

My wife found a job (her job loss, combined with a mountain of credit card debt precipitated the bankruptcy) so we are now both steadily employed and putting money away for retirement and into a college savings account for our daughter.  We also have lowered our student loan payments from about $1000 a month to about $500 a month.  However, we’re still living paycheck to paycheck for the most part, which is due in large part to our mortgage.  We’re paying $2414 per month (30 year fixed rate @ 6.125%) on a home that is underwater by about 15%.  We did not reaffirm the mortgage after CH7 so that we’d always have the option of walking away if it came to that, but we don’t want to leave our home or our neighborhood.  We just want some relief in the form of a lower interest rate, principal reduction, or at this point, even an extended repayment period.  Even through our bankruptcy we never even paid late nevermind missed a payment, but as I understand it, this is a disincentive to the bank to modify the loan.  As long as they see you are paying on time they see no reason to modify.  From what I’ve been told, the only way to get the bank’s attention, so to speak, is to stop paying.  

I reached out to the attorney who handled our CH7 case to schedule a consultation.  Since he’s away I won’t be able to get in to see him for two weeks so I just figured I’d poke around to see what I can find out in the meantime.  I do know from speaking to the paralegal that the retainer fee for a loan modification is $1500-since that’s only a little more than half a mortgage payment it doesn’t seem that excessive to me, but it will depend on how long this drags on.  We are located in NJ, a judicial state where foreclosures can take years, so we should have ample time to save up a large amount of cash should the attempt not be successful, but I’m really hoping that’s not the outcome.  We just want to stay in our home with a more affordable payment.  I’d be interested to hear from anyone else who has retained an attorney to assist with a loan modification to see how they fared.  I should add that our loan is with a medium sized NJ based bank-not B of A or one of the other giants-not sure if that matters much.  Also, we know we’re not eligible for any of the government programs because our loan is not insured by Fannie or Freddie and the P&amp;I portion of the mortgage is only about 30% of our income, just below the threshold.",finance,1407774092

personalfinance,Reasons to not buy a new car OTHER than the fact that it's an expense and not an investment.,"Reddit,
I am looking for some advice. 

I am a 23-year-old recent graduate with no college loans since I payed them off in installments with help from my mom. I am currently making $38,000 a year which calculates to $1982.80/month after taxes and insurance. I also have no tickets/accidents or points on my license and pay about $130/month for insurance without any collision coverage because my current car is paid off.

I currently drive a 2000 Chevy Impala that I bought from my grandmother in 2009 with 38,000 miles on it. Currently I put about 55,000 miles on the car in 5 years so it has about 90,000. Currently there are some repairs that the car needs, that are not urgent but VERY inconvenient (air/heat on its way out and I live in NY with harsh winters, electric not working so no messing with the windows etc…). I also spend $200/month on gas if I do not do any extra driving besides to work and back which I add is rare.

I am moving in with my boyfriend at the end of the month and we are splitting our rent so I have to come up with $625/month with everything included except food costs. He is encouraging me to invest in a Honda (I am looking into the Fit or a Civic since I do not need anything bigger, my Chevy is way too big as it is) and I am getting a lot of ""do not buy a new car"" from everyone else. Unless someone can convince me to lease, I do not want to lease.

Honestly, I need reasons other than the fact that a car is an expense and I will only lose out on money. I am well aware of this. That would be like buying a brand new iPhone, using it for two years than expecting $600 for it when selling it. My Impala has 90,000 and the highest offer I've received on it so far is $2500. I understand 100% that a new car is not an investment.

That being said, I plan on driving the car until I need a new one. I do not plan on buying a new car every 5 years. I plan on having this car for at least the next 10 years, which is why I'm leaning toward Honda.

Right now I have enough to also put a nice down payment on the car and I also have excellent  credit. I want to finance the car with a credit union and try to get 0%-0.9% interest. If I cannot find a good interest rate I will wait.

I need reasons other than losing out on money to not buy a car. I take defensive driving courses to get my insurance down, and I understand I will need more coverage on a new car. However, I am sick of blowing through money on gas, wondering if the heat and air conditioning will work on my 30 minute drive to work and various repairs that seem to keep popping up. I feel taking all that money and putting it toward a nice down payment would make more sense, especially toward a car that will last a long time, has working heat/air and is safer in the cold weather, working electric, much better gas mileage etc.

The Chevy has been reliable to get from A to B, but other features have not been. I want something more reliable.

Her APR on the different loans (7 I believe) avg out at about 6.5%. Now I haven't looked into getting a loan prior so I dont know what kind of APR is out there, would doing this makw sense? Is there anything I should watch out for while shopping around? Besides the interest rate (i want variable and not fixed correct?) and penalty for early repayment is there anything else I should look out for?",finance,1407782773
personalfinance,I got some numbers this time around...,"It's been advised that I post some numbers previously so here goes:

I make 1180 after taxes every 2 weeks. I'm losing my job sept 5, but get 2 weeks severance pay if i stay till the 5th. I'm looking for another job.

My Wife is a nanny. Her income varies wildly. She has two families, but is losing one. her other one will not need her for a few weeks because they are on vacation. She makes 15/hr. She has been looking for a ""real job"" since june but the employment gap is apparently hurting her.  She usually gets 16 hours a week (factoring out the family that she is losing to day care)

Mortgage: 928 per month. Bought house for 115k. 111k Left. 4% I try really hard to keep this up to date and have only fallen behind once. It's up to date right now.

CCard 1: 5487 owed. 5500 ceiling. 15.99%. Monthly is like 170something. It's been behind for a while so I don't know for sure :(

CCard 2: 10,826. Closed. 4%. 220ish Monthly. I talked to the bank about this one. They let me file a hardship to close it but bring the payment from ~330 to ~220. This just happened a few weeks ago.

CCard 3: 1899 currently. 5250 limit. 38 min monthly payment. I can't find the interest rate.

Utilities: Gas this month was $105. Electricity is showing 238.27 current / 115.00 budget. Water is usually about 69 per month. I also get billed separately for sewage but I dont know what it is right now. I think its normally around 100.  Garbage bill comes around once every 3 months.  No idea until it comes around again though. I have a few minor medical debts in collections all for under 100$

Loan: I have an unsecured loan at 4% 7622 left on it. 219.50 per month.

Car: 226.89 per month. pay off amt shows as 9846. I had to put some major miles on this so if i sold it there's no way i'de break even :(

Our car insurance is approx 110 per month. for both of us.

To clarify some earlier stuff from my last post: When I said i used the 401ks i didnt take a loan against them, I just cashed them in because I needed the money for emergencies. We've been fucked a long time :(

We are in a 2yr contract with Verizon for TV/Internet for 99.97 per month. We have the lowest package for TV we can get. I will jump w/o the internet.

our phones are running approx 120 per month.  I have a dumb phone my wife has a smart phone.

Currently I have about 120 dollars to my name. I need to pay the mortgage when I get payed on the 15th or it will be late. Whatever is left we use for food and transportation. I'm lucky enough right now to have a company car that I am allowed to drive everywhere so I don't pay for gas. Oh yeah my car is due for inspections/emmisions this month too woohoo!

We have cut back on a lot of expenses and basically don't go places or eat out anymore unless its cheaper than what we can make at home.  I'm thinking of trying to be a vegetarian to save on meat.  Other than that i'm just going to work and trying to stay away from bridges.

am I doooomed?

*Edit*
Because people seem to think I just go out and spend credit card money all willy nilly like:

The situation occurred because I had a very solid 70k+ a year job when incurring the debt and was actually 2-3 months ahead on most payments, but then that went sour and I had to take a 37k a year job.  My wife also had a 40 hour a week job at the time too.  Things were good then one day it was like POW! welcome to debtland.  It's not like I make it a point of saying ""hey lets go out and charge shit we can't pay off"".  

Thanks for all of the good advice though peoples.  I'm going to just let the credit card people and the unsecured loan eat it for a while.  I have the house at 4% (mission accomplished), and a phone interview coming up tomorrow.  I plan on repaying every penny I owe these guys, but priories first.

personalfinance,Am I headed down a bad path?,"Here's my situation:

* I have $64,000 in student loan debt at around 4.75% interest (There are two sets of loans--private loans with a single lendor for $32,000 @ ~4.5%, and federal loans with a single lendor for $32,000 @ ~4.5%).
* I have $44,000 in personal savings.
* I am self-employed, and my total tax burden for 2014 is estimated to be $69,000, of which I've already paid $10,000. (My CPA says I have until April 15, 2015 to pay the federal taxes in full, since this is my first year of self-employment.)
* I earn $3,846 per week and have about $3,000 that I can apploy to taxes, debt repayment, or savings.
* I have nine weeks of pay in store for me. (Each week, I am paid for the services I rendered nine weeks prior.)


My goal is to be completely debt-free this year--preferably, within the next five to six *weeks*, leaving me with the remainder of my tax burden to handle. That means that I plan to use my savings, in its entirety, to pay off my student loans. I'm somewhat OK doing this because, as mentioned earlier, I am paid weekly.

My concern is that, by focusing so intensely on repaying my student loans, I'd essentially just be on the hook to a new debtor, the federal and state governments, for my outstanding tax burden. Also, I'm $6,000 behind on federal taxes (I have the cash to pay them now but have been holding off; I feel a great deal more secure having a bit of cash in my savings account for once.) I figure that I could have my 2014 taxes paid in full by February 2015, but then I'd sort of be in a situation where, for a period of about eight weeks, I'd be responsible for both years' taxes.

I'm not sure of what to do--aggressively pay off my loans or give priority to my taxes.

Edit:

A few points of clarification:

* My intention is to resume payment of my taxes once my student loans are repaid in full in six weeks.
* The $69,000 tax burden (of which $59,000 remains) is a combination of both state and federal taxes.

My plan (still under development) so far, given your commonsense feedback, is to:

* Get caught up on taxes and to submit future tax payments on-time via EFTPS. (I literally received my PIN today.)",finance,1407783279
personalfinance,"US freelancer in Germany for the long haul. Retirement planning? (US/DE, 23)","Came to Germany two years ago, thought I’d only be here for a one-year fellowship, fell in love with a German, got decent jobs lined up (writing/editing/teaching), got married, stayed. My partner is not a freelancer. There may be some periods of time when he does postdoc work elsewhere (UK and US are on the list) for a couple years at a time, but we plan to stay here in the long run.

Before I came to Germany, I maxed out a Roth IRA (VFFVX) two years in a row and added two non-IRA funds on top of that (VSCGX and VASGX). Emergency fund is also taken care of. My partner and I live simply but comfortably—I’ll edit this post to give numbers if it’s strictly necessary. We’re debt free, thank God, and both fairly risk averse.

I consider myself fairly well read on the US side of things, but **I know less than nothing about the German retirement system/Rentenversicherung**. Almost every German I know is an employee, not a freelancer, so they’re on a different track. Any advice on this front (natürlich auch auf Deutsch) would be appreciated. 

Because I don’t end up owing the US federal government any taxes (though I file diligently!), I can’t contribute to a tax-advantaged account like an IRA anymore. **Does it make sense for me to continue socking away money in the other Vanguard accounts?**

Peripheral issues: I'm not likely to become an employee anytime soon. Unless the Bundestag changes the naturalization laws to allow for dual citizenship, I’m also not likely to naturalize. I am not willing to renounce my US citizenship—at least not until after my parents are long gone, and that’s way too far in the future to think about. I don’t know if my citizenship status affects any of this, but I’m basically on track for a Niederlassungserlaubnis.

personalfinance,Applying to nursing school as a double post baccalaureate. Need advice.,"Long time lurker, but everyone's situation is different so I thought I'd join to gain some much needed advice. 
I started college full time as a junior in high school through a dual enrollment program and earned my general AA the semester after graduating highschool. I transferred to a top state school the next semester and earned a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Anthropology with a 3.4 GPA. I was independent since turning 18 and had worked part time since I was 15 and due to this and scholarships I never took out any loans and have no student loan debt. (side note: I wanted to earn an radiology technician degree, to make a decemt income while advancing my education part time, but followed my parents advice to ""get a 4 year degree in A subject you love"")
I started working as a laboratory technician full time upon graduation, but there was no room for advancement without a graduate degree. I earned approximately $32,000 a year for 2.5 years.
I moved to a different state and gained employment for the past 2 years as a patient care technician in an emergency room (paycut of $28,000/yr) with the idea of earning some experience and letters of recommendation to go to PA school, but have fallen in love with the mobility of nursing. I plan on going back to school to earn licensure next year. 
This brings us up to where I am now. I live pay check to paycheck and follow a frugal lifestyle. I have $4000 in credit card debt I am constantly trying to pay off. I go to community college part time currently for my nursing prerequites and borrow my books each semester from the library. 
My choices are to go to community college locally and get my Associates of Nursing in 10 months for about $2,500, then work as an RN and advance my education gradually

 or follow my dreams of going to graduate school at a local university and earn my masters of nursing through an accelerated non nursing majors program in 3 years for approximately $9,000 a year without working until graduation. This would also provide me with more opportunities for research and a better education overall. 
My ultimate goal is to be a clinical coordinator and help conduct healthcare research.
I have no savings and would be taking out loans to support myself. 
Because I already have an undergrad degree I won't be able to get federal loans for the ADN program and will need private loans.

personalfinance,Help me with credit card payoff please!,"So after a couple boughts of temporary unemployment and generally being idiots about it, we're trying to get our debts paid off. We have several credit cards with terrible interest rates we used for necessities trying to stay afloat, and now that we're both in salaried employment and back on our feet with a little bit of savings we need to get our credit back up in hopes of getting a car loan soon for something big enough for our family (and so we're not running all around town in the same vehicle and spending hours waiting on one another to get off work in a town that has no public transport). To do that we need to get our credit cards paid off, but I can't decide which way would be best, or would boost our credit rating the quickest. I also want to pay off the remainder of our existing car loan before taking out another.


Besides what I'm putting aside to save for a good down payment on a car, I can afford to put aside at least $1100/month to pay down these debts:


$1350 @ 25.9% interest (interest doesn't accrue for another 4 months though)

$1800 @ 20.9% interest (interest doesn't accrue for another 6 months)

$1500 @ 13.99%

$800 @ 24.9%

$450 @ 22.24%

$2200 @ 22.9%

$5000 @ 4.9% (existing car loan)


I know higher interest rates should be paid down first, but should I try to drastically pay down one card to $0 balance at a time or spread out the money to get the utilization rate down? We're at about 80% utilization rate on the credit cards overall. Any advice is appreciated.

We sold our condo, netted $50k after mortgage payoff, and are currently living at my parents house.  We have a monthly combined net income of ~$7k.  Besides our existing car loans (11k total, 300/month = me......8k total, 250/month = wifey) the only large monthly bill for us is her student loan.  She has about $42k left to pay off in student loans.  Her monthly payment is about $450, but she has an automatic payment of $700.  To top it off her interest rate is 7.125%

We would like to tackle this loan while we are currently not making any mortgage payments.  One of the thoughts I was to make monthly $5k payments while we can, and pocket the rest for home savings.  I wanted to get the principal down as much as possible and then refinance the lowered principal when we were ready to move out.  This would ensure the lowest possible interest rate and monthly payment, as opposed to refinancing now.

Is there a better way to tackle this problem?

The main things for us are lower payments, while trying not to stay at the parents house for too much longer.

personalfinance,Auto loans vs student loans,"So I had a thought today. I am a 19 year old college student, and I currently have an auto loan. I owe about 1000$ dollars now (1 year in on a 3 year) and I have like a 17.9% interest rate. I know that's really crappy. It was my forst car and I couldn't get a cosigner. Now I also have some small student loans. I've been using my max unsubbed loans (2500 a semester) to live on and then paying back part of them from my part time job. I make about 500 dollars each month, ergo its like I'm only borrowing 500 a year. Using this system I'll have around 2000$ in student loan debt when I'm dome with college. Yay! But, as I was resubmitting paperwork a short while ago I noticed that the interest rate for undergrad subbed and unsubbed loans is 4.6%. That sure beats 17.9%! Right? I mean they're both accruing interest actively so wouldn't it be better to just go with a lower rate? My car payment each month is 60$ but if 17% of that goes to interest that's like 12$ each month, and a total like 230$ over the next 2 years. That could buy a lot of ramen! So I'm wondering if it wouldn't just be smarter to take out an unsubbed loan for the remaining balance on my car, and then pay that off as quickly as possible.

personalfinance,[Divorce] Need advice on a couple of the specific decisions left to make,"So.  Getting divorced, which is a bummer.

My wife is being pretty reasonable about the whole thing though, so I have a few decisions I need to work through the logic on that I'm having trouble making.  I'm keeping the house, so I'll owe her a bit of money as the house equity is more than half our net worth.  Basically the total due to her is around $160k.

We have about $140k in stocks and other liquid assets, with about $20k in unrealized capital gains. 

My options here are to keep half of the stocks, and owe her more money over the next five years, or give her almost all of them and owe her less.  By keeping them I'll have more capital to work with if there's an emergency or anything, plus I can keep investing it, but I'll be responsible for the capital gains on the half I keep accrued thus far.  Alternatively I can give her all of them and pay off more of my debt to her up front, plus avoid the capital gains.  I can't think of a good approach to determining which route is better to take.


The second thing is I currently owe $240,000 on my home (that appraised for ~500) at a ~3.25% interest rate 15 year loan.  She's not forcing me to refinance, but I'm wondering if I should refinance into a 30 year or something.  I know the interest rate would be higher.  I make enough that I can afford the current payment, but its a big house for one person so I was thinking if I could refinance (we've paid a lot off) I could probably halve my monthly payment and either rent it out and use the difference to rent a smaller place or have a lot more net income every month even if I keep living here.  Obviously in the long term I'd pay twice as much in interest, but it seems reasonable in that it will give me a lot more freedom if I choose to rent it at some point.  Never been a landlord before so I don't know the ins and outs of that either.

I moved to Texas because both of our job prospects are better here for after he graduates and I really like my school.

My interest rate is 7% by the way. (He is perfectly ok with using any amount of his income to set us up for a financially better future). We will also most likely be living separately as it us unlikely he will get a job in Austin, Tx, but probably Houston. So he will be an entry level engineer who needs to pay living expenses and his own student loans.

Mixed info from general wisdom and rates I'm seeing online,"I'm trying to estimate the closing costs for a first time home purchase, on top of a 20% down payment (and e-fund, etc). Essentially, how much cash do I want in the bank before I start seriously looking for a house? I'm confused about what's realistic in terms of lender fees.

My situation is roughly:

* 180K/year
* 0 debt
* 20% down payment
* 760+ credit
* 400-500K house goal
* Sometime next spring

I've found many sources that break out the specific fees for a theoretical loan. They all include the ""loan origination"" or ""origination points"" fees ranging from 0.5 - 1% of the loan amount. Then there are other specific things like application, underwriting, documents, etc that are all under the ""lender fees"" umbrella. At my credit union these sum to ~2.5% of purchase price (for research purposes). 3rd party fees are in addition to this.

However, when I search a website like Zillow's mortgage rate calculator that has me put in values for my specific situation, the lender fees are sometimes listed at $1, for a 4% interest rate, essentially the low for today for a 30 year fixed. Are these lender fees accurate? Are they leaving out lots of other things? In my situation can I really close with virtually nothing beyond my 20% down payment?

As I said, my student loans aren't really a factor because they will disappear in 9 years. Hers will stick around longer because she hasn't been able to find a teaching job in public schools so her 10 years won't start until she does.

personalfinance,What to do with a $10k Loan,"Quick background check, I'm entering third year of engineering. I made around 3k at my internship this summer and all of that goes towards rent ($480ish a month, all inclusive). Now I'm getting money from OSAP, financial need($5k), and am going to get a $10k student loan from TD in a week as a safety (since tuition fees are around $12k annually). Hopefully I won't be touching the loan money but more so for a back up, I also am thinking about a student line of credit but haven't looked into that yet. Anyhow, I'm curious whether or not I can do anything profitable with my $10k student loan in a safe manner- I usually research intensively before I do anything so I'm just curious whether or not investing some of that loan could be profitable. What would you guys suggest?


EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback guys! Sadly I don't have the time reply to each of you, but as i commented before:....my tuition is $14,000, my living expenses is $5000-6000.  Might get a $5000 Financial Need grant but that happens mid year. Then $500-$2000 comes from other costs (supplemental exam fees, online courses, etc.). I took everyone's advise to heart so I ended up getting a 10,000 line of credit instead. Interest rate will be %4.5, I will be using this as a safety just in case. Meaning if I do not use any of the credit then no interest will accumulate.",finance,1407811975

personalfinance,Will opening a new credit card hurt my credit score in 6 months when I buy a car.,"Im 24yo and I will have all credit card debt paid off on Nov 1st. I use my current 1% cash back card for all transactions and generally pay off the balance within a few days of each transaction. This in essence gets me 1% off everything I purchase right off the bat. What I would like to do is get a Capitol 1 quicksilver card as my primary transaction card due to the high cash back rate of 1.5%. My delima is I have a 3 yo car(1/2 paid off) that I would like to trade in for a new car in 6 months since my current car was a basic commuter and I would like a car that matches my desires as well as needs. Would I be better off not getting the Capitol One card in order to ensure a lower interest rate on the future loan or would getting the card be beneficial and have a limited affect on my credit score and interest rate?

Key points
-I have a 759 credit score with TransUnion.
-My deposit on the new car will keep payments equal to my current car payments.
-My current car is nearly equal in value to what is owed on the loan.
-I currently have about 1500 dollars in monthly transactions that go through my credit cart.

personalfinance,Need advice in where to start with rebuilding/improving my credit.,"So I'll be honest, my credit is basically fucked up as all heck right now. Mostly in part due to a lack of diligence when I was younger, some due to overspending in recent years, some due to just not thinking properly.

Long story short, I ended up living off of credit cards after losing my job approximately 7-8 years ago, ended up defaulting on them and now I'm trying to rebuild my credit. Unfortunately, my mindset up until recently was ""Well, my credit is fucked anyway."" without any thought to the fact that many of this stuff will be going away soon.

Well, now the time has come. I was recently promoted, I'm making ~40% more than I was two years ago, and the major credit cards I defaulted on all those years ago are now gone and off my credit reports (With one exception that will be coming off of this month)

I have one open auto-loan in good standing that I am still upside-down on (With an insane interest rate), 2 credit cards in good standing (Though as of writing this, they are both maxed out as I recently had to move across country without any savings) and I want to fix things and get my credit score up to par so I can get rid of the car I currently have (That I hate) and get something nicer and newer ASAP.

I have a number of derogatory marks on my credit report; one medical bill for about $1000 and a few smaller unpaid bills (Nothing over $300, most around about $100 each, maybe 6-7 of them or so.) I want to know where to begin.

Should I get rid of the derogatory marks first and THEN pay off my credit cards? Should I pay off my cards first? I just need to know what will affect me the most and the soonest.

I used to float between 700-750 when I was only 20-21.
Now I'm barely over a 500 on some of them, despite 2 years of on-time payments on credit cards and an auto loan.

I can't take any more of it, it's been 7 long years. I want to fix it. I just need some advice.

I need help with my plan of action.","So I'm a single, child-free person and my take home pay is $31,890 per year after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc. However, my student debt and its interest is eating me alive. Please... I need help figuring this out. I know there's a lot of other student loan posts but I looked at similar inquiries and was still left with some confusion.

[Here](http://imgur.com/3hVszST) is a summary of all 10 of my student loans and their interest rates.

My current repayment plan is IBR (income-based repayment) and I currently pay $408 a month, which is roughly half of the monthly accrued interest on all my loans. Interest just keeps accruing and my balance steadily increases as I throw money at it. I don't want to keep doing this!

I'm working on the assumption that consolidating all 10 of my loans into one single mega-loan is a bad idea. (Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the averaged interest rate on the huge consolidated loan would be detrimental in the long run?)

I take home $2657.64 per month. According to the [standard 10 year repayment plan](http://imgur.com/eaDlifC) I need to pay $1,537 per month to be debt-free in 10 years. This is rough, but doable. I already have a budget worked out for this scenario. Assuming consolidation is out of the question, I have no idea how to divvy that up between the 10 loans. Do I focus my attention on the most expensive loans first? Do I calculate monthly interest on each loan separately and pay a certain percentage above that for each loan? Basically, how the heck do I micromanage these 10 individual loans to ensure they're all paid off in 10 years?

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 216 - Operation: MoonShot! Go Go Go!,"Hey all, GoodShibe here!

Here's what the recent price collapse is telling me:  That we've reached a saturation point within our cryptosphere -- pretty much every single cryptocoin is taking a freaking beating right now, BTC included.

What it means to me is that the people who *are* here are fed up and pulling out.  The cryptosphere, especially the altcoin scene, has been cannibalistic for a while, but it seems like people are finally starting to realize that.  

They've seen that the snake is eating its own tail... and so they're taking their toys and going home.

Dogecoin can survive this -- in fact, I would say, unabashedly, that we are actually poised to survive this -- if we act *now*.

Which is why I've created [Operation: MoonShot](http://www.reddit.com/r/DogecoinDefenseForce/comments/2d9nnj/miners_support_shibes_your_mission_should_you/).

And I'm asking all Shibes, including the Miners and Support Shibes of our Dogecoin Defense Force, to come together to support our coin by doing what we do best: 

Reaching out.  Tipping.

Operation: Moonshot is about taking Tipping back to its roots - limiting 'giveaways' and returning Dogecoin to being valued as a token of genuine appreciation.

It's about fostering a change in mindset within ourselves as much as it's about mobilizing Shibes. 

But otherwise, the plan is simple: It's time for us to get on out there to USE the wonderful, but largely ignored, tipbots that have been created on other sites.

* **On Twitter** @tipdoge is the tipping bot and it works extremely well!  The syntax for tipping on twitter is @tipdoge tip @xxxxx (name) 500  &lt;--- or 10 or 100 or...

* **On Facebook** you can tip DOGEs by setting yourself up with the [Dogecoin Tipping App](http://apps.facebook.com/wpdogetipping/) then joining a group that has the Dogecoin Tipping App merged to it.  Like this one: fb.com/groups/givedogesto/ and you can tip anyone on Facebook by posting this syntax from the group:
""give X doge to &lt;Blue Hotlinked Name&gt; &lt;comment&gt;""

* **On Steam** you can tip DOGEs by setting yourself up with the [Steam Doge Bot](http://steamdogebot.com/) and you can join the [Doge Tip group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DogeTip) on Steam as well.

You can also use services like **[Cryptiv](https://cryptiv.com/)** to tip on Twitter, Twitch and Youtube.

I've long believed that a new-Shibe's first Dogecoins should be tipped to them.  Not given.  

Tipped.

Earned.

For contributing to the discussion, for making great art, for any host of reasons -- but reasons that specifically recognize achievement in the moment.

Not that giveaways can't be fun, but they, in my opinion, mentally devalue Dogecoin - it's so cheap, so worthless, we're literally giving it away.

But tipping.  Tipping done right, in the moment, when it's earned, when the person receiving it truly understands that they are being valued and appreciated -- that is what we need to recover about Dogecoin.  It doesn't matter how much it's 'worth' at the moment, that will come in time -- we need to bring that celebration back.

That wonder that comes with one's first few coins.

If we want Dogecoin to be valued as Dogecoins, not as stand-ins for BTC or LTC or USD, then THIS is what we must do.

And so, with Operation: MoonShot that's exactly what we're going to do.

Pick a tipbot, pick a community.  If you're already active on any of these communities, then great - we need you to be more active.

But if Dogecoin is going to survive, we need to work to bring in new-Shibes, to share our fun and friendly community spirit.

Our ethos of Fun and Kindness, Compassion and Camaraderie.

If we do this, if we do it together, with a genuine spirit... we will survive.

Because what happened yesterday is only the beginning.  

The altpocalypse is here, my friends.

It's 7:27AM EST and we've found 89.57% of our initial 100 Billion DOGEs -- only 10.43% remains until our period of Hyper-inflation ends! Our Global Hashrate is holding strong at ~48 Gigahashes per second and our Difficulty is up from ~820 to ~877.

As always, I appreciate your support!

personalfinance,"Should I stay with my current car loan terms, refinance for lower payment/interest rate but for a longer term, or trade it in for a less expensive lease?","I have a 2010 Explorer.  The payments are about $448 per month with a 5% interest rate and I have about 36 months left out of a 72 month loan.  It is currently worth about $1000 or so more than I currently owe on it.  It has about 57k miles.

I recently got an offer from creditkarma for refinancing at 2.75% for 42 months which would give me nearly another year of payments but the payments would be lower ($366/mo.)

I also work at a dealership now so I get great prices on new vehicles.  I could lease a new Escape that would suit our needs just fine, have better fuel economy (12/19 mpg for the Explorer vs 22/30 for the Escape) and I can get one with all of the great new technology (a loaded Titanium vs my XLT Explorer) for $299/mo (24 mo lease) if I trade in my Explorer and put $1,000 down.  I used to not like the idea of leasing, but it is growing on me because the payments are low and I like the idea of having a new vehicle every 2 years without the kick in the pants of having to pay thousands in sales tax at the DMV to register it.

Further information:  I also have a motorcycle that I use to get around often in the summer, and a crappy 04 Aveo with 121k miles on it for the winter which is paid off.  I use either the bike or the Aveo and my Fiance uses the Explorer because she doesn't drive cars with a manual transmission.  We're looking at saving up for a wedding (no help from family) so the lower payments would be nice, but the Explorer is in great condition and has relatively low miles (about 57k.)  Although it doesn't have much in the way of technology, it'll likely last a LONG time after it is fully paid off.  It will, however, always have crappy gas mileage.  

I don't much care for driving the Aveo, especially to work, because it sucks being a car salesman with a shitty car.  If I wait and pay off the Explorer, I can get a nice car for myself and sell the Aveo.  If I switch to a lease then I'll save about $150/mo in payments and almost $100/mo in gas, but I'll not own anything in the next 3-4 years (depending on if I keep my current terms or refinance.)  I guess the other option would be to buy the Escape, but that would mean I'd be paying nearly the same payments and for another 72 months (with a very low interest rate.)

So here's where I am:  My fiance and I both like the Explorer and the Escape, they're both great vehicles.  The technology and gas mileage on the Escape are much better, though, and we don't need the 3rd row seating or enhanced cargo space.  Should I trade in the Explorer and save about $250/mo between payments and fuel (and have a new vehicle with all the bells and whistles including heated seats and remote start which are awesome in the winter,) keep the current terms on the Explorer and have it completely paid off (saving $448/mo in payments) in 3 years, or refinance at 42 month/2.75% and just continue paying $448/mo anyway (would that end up paying off the loan substantially faster than staying at 36mo/5%?) or just refinance the Explorer and save about $80/mo until it is paid off at the end of 42 months?

**TL;DR:** Option 1 - Keep my current vehicle at current terms and own it outright in 36 months

Option 2 - Refinance my current vehicle at a lower interest rate with lower payments and own it outright in 42 months.

Option 3 - Refinance my current vehicle but continue to pay what I currently pay which would knock about $80 off the principle each month

Option 4 - Trade it in and get a brand new vehicle with substantially better features and better gas mileage, but never own it because it is a lease",finance,1407854351

personalfinance,Any idea of the future of saving account interest rates?,"TL;DR. Skip the first paragraph for my questions. 

I am 22 and I have about $22,000 saved up from working my ass off while going to community college for two years. I have since decided to join the US Navy, got a two year degree but not four year, because I want to and I have a great rate or ""job"" in the Navy. Main reason is my heart isn't into college now, but I plan on finishing up my degree in the Navy. I have $21,000 in an Ally bank account earning .88% interest accruing daily, comes out to 51 cents of interest a day, paid monthly at about $15.xx.

Could a spike in interest rates be coming? I remember a few (about 6 years ago I think) years ago interest rates on savings accounts were in the 4% range...I know I opened an ING Direct account, with very little money, at that rate while a teenager. Are rates like that just out of the picture now?

Is keeping $21,000 in a savings account paying .88% interest, accrued daily, a bad idea? I don't have a pressing need for this money now and I pay my credit card and everything else from my other online bank account.

Thanks in advance!",finance,1407867955

Primera etapa: Los bancos son autorizados por la reserva federal y el BCE, a conceder todo tipo de créditos, sobre todo hipotecarios con las mayores facilidades al cliente, Para ello la reserva federal y el banco central Europeo, emitirán todo el dinero que le soliciten los bancos para conceder dichos créditos, después, de unos Cuantos años, sucediendo créditos a diestro y siniestro a penas sin poner inconvenientes, viene la segunda etapa


Segunda etapa: A estas alturas el consumidor ya ha pagado una buena parte de la deuda, y aquí se pone en marcha el parón, de golpe se corta el flujo de los créditos, todos Los bancos al unísono, dejan de conceder créditos, y todas las empresas constructoras con proyectos enteros terminados, así como urbanizaciones enteras Por vender ciento de miles de viviendas esperando comprador, comprador que no llega, pues no se conceden créditos, todos estos pisos se los tuvieron Que comer las constructoras, y muchas de ellas no aguantaron el tirón, y miles de empresas que viven de ellas tampoco, viniéndose abajo y mandando al Paro a millones de personas que tenían pendiente créditos hipotecarios que no iban a poder seguir pagando, otras industrias como la del automóvil también Corrieron la misma suerte, y esto dio paso a la tercera etapa 


Tercera etapa: Los bancos ante el impago de los créditos inician su elaborado plan de quedarse con todo, los desahucios no se hicieron esperar, quedándose con las viviendas Y dejando a sus propietarios en la calle, y con la deuda que les faltaba por pagar, quiero aclarar, que un crédito es un dinero adelantado que va existiendo en la Medida que el consumidor lo va pagando mes tras mes, bajo este principio hay que entender, que los bancos prestan un dinero que no existe, luego se quedan Con las casas de sus víctimas que sí que existen, y que estuvieron pagando mes tras mes un dinero que sí que existía, y se quedaron con una deuda real, que no Deja levantar cabeza a nadie, esto no es la primera vez que ocurre, porque esto mismo ya lo hicieron en 1910 y en 1929, con el el famoso crack, la gente al igual Que ahora se tiraba por la ventana, fíjense en el reciente ejemplo de Bankia, sus directivos dicen que no quieren los pisos, que prefieren el dinero, pues bien Resulta que se les rescata con 25.000 millones de euros, cantidad que tiene que pagar el pueblo, a parte la propiedad de miles y miles de viviendas para negociar Y especular con ellas, encima les sirve de excusa para lamentarse alegando que su activo esta en propiedades, que no tienen liquidez, veamos tienen una gran Liquidez gracias al rescate que tendremos que pagar entre todos, más las propiedades de miles y miles de viviendas, encima se quitan gastos, cerrando 1.500 Oficinas bancarias, mandando al paro más de 5.000 Empleados, esto es para meterlos en la cárcel, pero quien mete en la cárcel a los jefes del mundo?.",finance,1407877013
personalfinance,Student loan advice for final semester grad student,"Basically, due to some unforeseen circumstances, I have been unable to complete my masters thesis.  I am about 75% of the way done, but will need to take one last semester to complete it.  Everything else required for the degree has been completed, just not this last piece.  
   To take the one class required for thesis work, it costs approximately $4000.  Now, I'd love to be able to pay this out of pocket but to be put on a payment plan through the school, I have to pay $800 upfront on top of the $4000 for the class.  I work close to full time, but also close to minimum wage so paying $800 up front only to have to pay the rest within a few months just doesn't seem feasible.  
   My thought had been to get a small federal loan to cover what I cannot, but due to thesis classes being credit/no credit and my receiving no credit for the past several semesters, the financial aid office has deemed me ineligible for federal aid.   
   Also, in the spirit of full disclosure, due to thinking all my student loans were being paid through one company and missing one, I recently had a loan go into collections.  I finally paid it off, but I know it takes time for that to be reflected on my credit score and also know that, regardless, my credit score is somewhere around a 670 (give or take).  The only thing I can think of, at this point, is a private loan which is something I really wanted to avoid but can't seem to think of anything else.  I don't have a cosigner, it's just me.   
   I really don't need any lectures on finishing my paper and the horrible position I have landed myself in, I have beaten myself up about this every day for quite some time.  I'm just hoping that somebody can give me some insight as to what I can do going forward.  I am, admittedly, relatively clueless when it comes to finances so any help is appreciated.  I looked through old posts pertaining to student loans, but didn't see anything particularly helpful for this situation.  Also, sorry if this explanation was longer than it needed to be!",finance,1407879700
personalfinance,Post-College Financial Woes,"Alright, so to start off I have not finished college because I decided to withdraw for the time being so I would not put myself further in debt. I live in Pennsylvania, and the financial aid situation in this state is kind of messed up. My step-father makes more than the ""allowable"" amount for financial aid, because they assume that you will be helped with the money for college by your parents. Long story short, I needed to take out private loans instead of state/financial aid loans if I wanted to attend college. 

I have a part-time job right now where I make around $7.75 an hour and work there 16 hours a week. I also have an independent contracting job where I make close to $200 a weekend, but that job essentially makes me work a combined 24 hours on Saturday/Sunday. The contracting job is also seasonal and only lasts 3 months every year.

Now, what I need to pay for:

I have three private loans from Sallie Mae. I will list the interest rate, the minimum payment, and then the total amount for each loan.

1st Loan- 8%, $490.79, $22,838.47

2nd Loan-  9.25%, $173.99, $6,408.75

3rd Loan- 7.5%, 525.91%, $25,084.56

I have paid the forbearance fee for the past 6 months, which totals in $300, and it will last until October.

Along with this, I also need to worry about rent, which is about $350 a month. 

My family has been helping out where they can with food/rent/transportation (I lack a license and a car, I walk to my part-time job and get a ride to the other on the weekends.)

**ANALYSIS:**

* Crunch time for the EU

With the average age of European Union (EU) nuclear plants now at around 30 years, bringing enough new capacity online to match that lost through the closure of old nuclear plants will present a major challenge, writes Stephen Tarlton.

Currently, 131 nuclear power reactors with a combined capacity of around 122 GWe account for over one-quarter of the electricity generated across all of the EU's 28 member states. But with the French government planning to cap nuclear capacity at its current level of around 63 GWe, along with the politically-motivated decisions by two member states (Germany and Belgium) to exit nuclear power over the next decade, a decline in EU capacity up to around 2030 is all but inevitable.

Without the establishment of so-called Generation III nuclear technology in the EU, the sector will continue to decline, and consequently there will be little chance of the EU's climate and energy security targets being met.

personalfinance,I am starting grad school this semester and need some advice on how to handle my undergraduate private loans,"As an undergraduate, I was in a very strange situation. My parents had no money and I was not a resident of the United States even though my family lived here. This meant that I qualified for in-state tuition but did not qualify for federal aid and could not apply for FAFSA. I ended up borrowing 20,000$ in private loans in order to finance my education. I am now in grad school and I am FINALLY a resident which means I can get federal financial aid. I actually qualify for a lot more federal aid than I need and I think it might be a good idea to ask for all the aid I am being offered and use the extra money to pay for my private loans (which have ridiculous interest rates and are cosigned by a family friend, a burden I would like to relieve him of). Would it be a good idea to use these federal loans to pay of my private loans? I think having Federal debt is much more manageable than having private loan debt.

Some more context: I will not be graduating for another 3 years so I wont have any income until then to start paying off my undergraduate loans. When I graduate, I will be around 140,000 in debt (including the 20k in private loans). Thank you",finance,1407890871

personalfinance,I am turning 28 next week and my net worth just hit 1 million dollars. This is my story.,"The following is my story of how I got to where I am today.  The only reason I am sharing this is so that hopefully others will be able to follow in my footsteps.  I want to start by saying that I did not inherit this or just come into the money.
I graduated from a well known public university with a bachelors degree in engineering when I was 21.  I started working immediately after graduation in my field with a 40 hour/week job making approximately $65k/year.  For the next three years I stayed living with my parents (rent-free) so that I could save pretty much my entire take home paycheck.  I used the family vehicle to commute to work and my only expenses were incidental expenses from going out or buying inexpensive everyday items.  I understand that this is a favorable starting position that not everyone is fortunate enough to be in but hopefully everyone can benefit from the story all the same.
It didn’t take me long to save up enough money to buy my first investment property since I only needed 20% down and a small amount of additional capital for closing costs and repairs.  I looked for distressed properties, typically forclosures, with a lot of cosmetic damage that significantly impacted the price but were not expensive to repair.  For example, broken windows, poor condition of paint/carpet, old/dilapidated fixtures are all cheap to repair but significantly bring down the selling price.  I stayed away from anything that required repairs related to water, fire, or electrical damage as I imagine the repairs being more substantial and possibly requiring professional/licensed labor.
At the time, I was able to buy single family houses between $90k-110k with financing between 5.25%-5.875%.  The mortgages for these properties varied between $350-$450 per month and the rents were between $1250-$1650 per month.  After I bought the first property I saved the income (and my paycheck) to quickly obtain the second property.  A third and fourth property soon followed all using the same model. By the time I obtained my fourth property I was saving (after all expenses and taxes) upwards of $7000 per month.  The only reason I stopped after getting 4 properties was that the banks would not lend me anymore money since my debt to income ratio had risen to the very maximum that most lenders would allow.  I looked into private lending to continue expanding but in the end the numbers  didn’t make sense (down payment, interest rates, amortization period, etc.).
While all of this was going on I was maxing out my retirement contribution through my employers 457 program as well as a personal Roth account.  Having these 4 investment properties as well as maxing out my 457 provided me with an enormous tax shelter such that I was able to get back most of my tax witholdings throughout the year in my tax return.
When I was 25 I moved out of my parents house and bought my own place for a price in the low $300k range.  I only moved out because I had gotten married at that time otherwise I would have stayed longer and continued to build my portfolio.
Now I had gotten very lucky with the real estate market because I had started working right after the collapse of the real estate bubble.  Because of this I was able to buy properties very cheaply and the house values largely recovered within the last 7 years.  Each of the investment properties is now valued in the low $200 thousands from the $90-$100k I bought them at.  I have already sold one and have two more in escrow.  I intend to sell the last one next year and get out of the rental business entirely.
I invested the proceeds from the sale of the property into a mutual fund and I intend to invest the proceeds from the other three properties into mutual funds as well.  The intention is to keep all the funds in the market (through highs and lows) until I am ready to retire.
While the housing market was recovering, the funds my 457 was in was recovering as well.  The value of the 457 (including the employer match) had more than double the amount that I personally invested.  Now I am sitting with approximately $300k in retirement accounts and mutual funds with another approximate $700k in equity between my three remaining investment properties and principal residence.
I understand that market timing and a stable home life had a lot to do with this success story, but I hope that whoever is reading this can pick up some tips or at least some inspiration, if nothing else, to make their own success story.  It is possible for an everyday average American to build a net worth from nothing to whatever their goal is regardless of how long it takes.

personalfinance,IRA with TSP,"I'm 33, married with two kids, and a US Govt employee making ~$130k. My wife works a stable job, makes around $70k. Being a fed employee I have a pension, great job security, and a really good idea of future income. In 12 +/- 2 years I will ""max out"" at Level III of the Executive Schedule, which is around $167k today. I have no interest in retiring early. 

I currently have about $100k in my TSP. I have been contributing enough to get the full match - so 5% of my pay to get another 5% from Uncle Sam - but that's not close to the $17,500 max contribution. By any reasonable calculation my TSP plus FERS (the pension) plus SS plus my wife's contributions will be enough to give us a comfortable retirement. 

My question has to do with our First World Problem of how to handle extra money (lets say $500, but increasing over time) at the end of each month. The options as I see them are a) contribute more to the TSP, b) open an IRA, or c) open a 529 for the kids (they are both under 4yrs). The TSP seems like a great deal, and it's easy, but it can't be used for education expenses. The IRA, as I understand it, could be used for both retirement and education but would probably have higher fees than the TSP. The 529 would make me feel better about having money explicitly for education, which seems like the priority since I'm comfortable with our retirement planning. It's also hard to plan for educational expenses, since I know our families will want to contribute to the grandkids' college too. 

Do you think that the flexibility of an IRA is worth the extra costs vs the TSP? (The equivalent Vanguard fund would be 7 times more expensive.) When saving for unknown college costs, are there advantages to the 529 vs an IRA? Is there anything else I should be considering?

personalfinance,Am I doing this right?,"Hi!

I would just like some opinions are a couple of things. First I'll lay down my fiances to try and paint a better picture.

I currently take home about $1800 monthly AFTER taxes, 401K, health insurance, and ESPP.

* $400 rent/internet/home/electricity/gas (I live with my SO of many years)

* $375 car payment (last car got totaled, new (used) car + part of my old loan is why it is so high, but very low interest rate, 2.75%)

* $305 car insurance (6 points on my driving record… they fall off next summer, hoping this will go down eventually)

* $35 cell phone

* $200 every month into my savings account that I do not touch. ( Roughly 10k in there now )

* the rest is for food/gas/dog/ what ever else. I throw what ever is left into my savings at the end of the month.


DEBT

* car loan - 20k ish. not in a hurry to it pay off as my interest rate is so low, and cars depriciate fast. Simple interest loan.

* student loan - 10k subsidized goverment loan. I don't owe on them until I finish school in 2016, and I won't be taking out any more loans as I have grants/ schorlships to cover the rest of my tution (as long as I keep my grades). I don't start to owe interest until I graduate.

* credit cards - $0, none. I pay this is full every month. 

My question is about my savings, 401K, and ESPP.

I currently put 3% into a ROTH 401k, and 3% into a Traditional 401k. I honestly do not know the difference, and my employer matches up to 6%… so I just split it. I'm probably making the least amount of money I will ever make in my life time, unless something unforseen happens. Is this okay? Should I put the whole 6% into one or the other…? What is most logical?

I am currently putting 3% into my companys ESPP. It is a 6 month period… at the end of the period, they buy at the lowest prices over the period, plus a 15% discount. Should I put more into the ESPP since I already have a bit in savings? I am not really gaining any interest on it, obviously, so I feel the ESPP may be a better choice. Should I move some of my monthly $200 into this? Raise my contribution?

Or should I just pay off my student loans and car loans early?

What would you do, and why? My parents were never financially secure… so I am trying to figure this out on my own!

Thank you for any and all input. I'd be happy to answer any more questions.

financialindependence,"Evaluate my 7-year tax-loophole-driven FI plan (Pittsburgh, PA, USA)","Hi FI!
  

I've been interested in PF/FI for a very long time but am just now getting into the workplace after a long, long time in school (just finished law school). I will try for medium-length post.

  
Here's the situation:

  
Married, both my wife and I are teachers making about the same amount. I hated law school and was too burnt out to effectively study for the bar in July, so I'm taking it in January.
  

Through family connections, we bought a 120-year-old house on about 4 .25 acre lots very near wife's family for $160k; property had offers for $200k and it was in *terrible* shape when we bought it. We've put a lot of work into it and I expect it'll be worth at least $250k by the end of the year due to our updating. Wife's father is an electrician who built his own home and plays around with engines for fun and fancy; he's effectively a one-man repair shop and is very happy to help around our place. It has room for chickens, bees, fruit trees and plants, a huge garden, etc. We plan on living in this house until we die.

  
Other than the house, the only liabilities we have are my student loans which are $169k. Here's where it gets fun.

  
Part of Obama's re-election campaign was passage of the [Pay-As-You-Earn federal student loan relief program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans). Basically, this program reduces payment to 10 percent of discretionary income, which is the difference between your adjusted gross income and 150 percent of the poverty guideline for your family size and state of residence. Since I'm married, my baseline number would be [$23,595](http://familiesusa.org/product/federal-poverty-guidelines). Anything I make above that number would be taxed at 10% for 20 years. At the end of 20 years, the remainder of the loan is forgiven (although I would have to treat whatever is forgiven as income for tax purposed that year).

  
So when we run the numbers, this is what we get:  

  
Current Income:  
$75k, teaching salaries  
$5k, single rental property, protected by corporation beginning 2015  
**Ttl: $80k yearly**  
  

Expenses:  
1,250, mortgage  
25, Health insurance  
120, Medical expenses (wife has T1 Diabetes, very well controlled)  
240, utilities  
175, insurances  
350, car fuel  
60, cells  
250, groceries  
200, spending and miscellaneous budget  
425, loan payments  
**Ttl: $3,150 monthly, $37,800 yearly**  
  

**Net: $38k pre-tax**  

  
38k is not that much, but one of the reasons we moved near Pitt is to take advantage of areas in which renting is the norm and where property is very inexpensive. I just partnered with my in-laws to buy a 3-unit rental which brings in ~$700/month net income for $41k (20% down @ $8.2k), which is close to a 20% ROI and a 102% ROE. I plan on doing the same thing every year as often as possible and putting those rentals under an umbrella corporation and reinvesting the earnings before tax through the corporation to avoid increasing my AGI (thus also avoiding paying more on those loans). 

  
With a 5% raise in active income per year (which I have no doubt of given my law degree and my wife's near-tenure position with her school), a 3% raise in expenses, and a reinvestment of the passive, non-taxed RE income each year (8% average ROI for RE, 5% average ROI for stocks), we believe we can invest $428k divided ~73%/27% RE/Stocks and have a passive income of $3,100 per month. **I have an excel file showing my calculations if someone can tell me how to put that online and link it.**

  
My wife and I decided that anything not listed as an expense in the above has to be paid through some alternate means of income not listed. For example, my wife wants to plant fruit trees, so she has started making and selling candles. I would like to travel, so I began writing e-books and got my real estate license. But those expenses and income we don't include here because the income isn't reliable and the expenses aren't necessary. We are looking at the bare bones of the situation. In theory, if we wanted to quit in 7 years, we could. In reality, if none of our side projects work out, we would work 2-3 more years to increase the passive income by about 30%.

personalfinance,I need help with educational financial aid for a California teaching credential student,"Here is my situation.   I am receiving some financial aid from the federal government around $12,000 split between subsidized and unsubsidized loans.  I made too much money last year and don't qualify for grants.   After paying for my tuition from my financial aid each semester I will have roughly 4,600 to last me all year.  This is a very intense one year program (I split my time between observing/working  at a school site and taking classes to prepare me for teaching M-F 8:00 A.M.-around 7:00 PM) so I don't have time to pick up a job.  I am figuring that I need around $8,000-$10,000 to last me throughout the year.  Here is the dilemma, since I am a credential student I don't qualify for student loans through a private lender.  Are there any options out there where I can defer a loan until I am done with my program, similar to a federal loan?  Are there any out there that can offer a relatively low interest rate?

personalfinance,"PF, Please help me look logically at taking a job that pays less, but puts me closer to family.","My current job: Retail manger (commission with small manager stipend)  I expect to make $50-$55K this year, and if promoted within the next year or two, will likely make $65-$80K depending on where I'm relocated to. For the most part, I enjoy my job, but for the past several months I've been putting in 60 hour weeks and I'm getting tired.  I have very little flexibility with my time off since we have such a small staff and feel like so many events are just passing me by.

When I accepted this promotion (about two years ago), I moved away from friends and family to another state, and it's starting to wear on me a bit when I see how much I'm missing in their lives.  As far as the promotion, it could happen in three months, or it could happen in three years.  I'm getting a little frustrated trying to plan a life when I'm not sure when I'll need to move again.  I'm also not very fond of the city I'm currently living in.  I do however like my coworkers, and have high job security.

The possible job: I have a final interview that they're flying me out to.  It's a salaried position making $42-45K.  I'll be moving back to the same city as friends and family, and will, in simplified terms, be working as a company recruiter.  Not as great job security.

The issue:  I have 60 grand in federal loans that I'm currently paying on.  Right now I'm able to put 800 to 1000 dollars towards them a month, and still live very comfortably.  I could have these loans paid off in 4-5 years easily since I still have some room to trim my budget with my current salary. If I switch to this new job, not only will the move wipe out my savings, but I'll more than likely be pushing back my debt payoff by several years, plus need to accept a much less comfortable standard of living (which still isn't terrible, just not as nice).

I'm torn.  After talking to my district manager, he agreed that I was putting in too many hours and told me that it was okay to let some things slide while we're understaffed.  The other manager has also stepped up a little bit more to help with the workload after it was pointed out that his performance was not up to par.  While that does take care of my biggest issue, I'm still stuck away from family and friends working weekends and crappy retail hours.  Being debt free in 5 years or less, depending on promotion, sounds amazing though.

Am I crazy for considering the new job?  Every time I run the numbers I start to flip flop on my decision.  Since I'm sure you guys will want to know, here's my current and expected budget for both jobs.

Current:  Take home is around 3000 a month after health insurance and 401K

$1000 - loans

$250 - savings

$1000 - rent/utilities

$450 - car $267 /insurance $105 / gas $78

$300 - groceries and entertainment

New Job: Take home = 2500 a month? (I'm still not sure on this.  This is a guess based on calculators on the internet.  If anyone has some better insight into take home at this salary, I'd appreciate the info.  I'm also not sure about insurance and other benefits.  I'll find these out tomorrow)

$800 - loans

$200 - savings 

$500 - car/gas/insurance (I'll need to live farther from my job for a more affordable rent.  Also, I'm currently on a lease for my car, so there's not much I can do about payments.  Yes I've seen all of the posts abouts lease hatred.  I did it before I had a reality check and got serious about tackling my debt.)

$800 - rent and utilities  (I'm trying to find a roommate situation to get this closer to $550, but I have two small dogs that are making it difficult)

$200 - food and entertainment

My emotions tell me to take the new job as long as the benefits turn out to be somewhat decent, but my budget tells me I'm crazy.  Is there anything else I should be considering?  I'd appreciate any advice. 

********Update***********

I wanted to thank all of you guys for confirming that I wasn't crazy for considering it.  I found out the benefits are ridiculously better than my current job, which made up most of the difference in pay for me.  I'll get weekends off, 9 more holidays, and two weeks more sick pay than I currently do.

I never really paid attention to investing my money until recently when I started to really think about my retirement.  I've always contributed 6% to my 401K (which is my firm match) but last year I started to max it out and also started to contribute to my Roth 401k this year. The 401K option that my firm offers is through Vanguard 2050 so both of my 401ks are tied to it. I work at a consulting firm so I have limitations on where I can invest due to independence issues.  

I also have 25K in Fidelity NASDAQ Composite Index Fund and I add $500 to this fund every month.  Starting next year, I plan to max both of my 401K ($17,500 each).

For my 100K, I was thinking of I-Bonds, but there's a $10,000 limit every year.  I was also looking into CDs such as PenFed, but last time I checked, the rate was pretty low for a 5 year CD.  I was also looking into REIT but not sure if that's a good play (if you can't already tell, I'm very risk averse).

personalfinance,Mom took a CD left to me before I was 18. What should I do?,"So here the story.

When I was about 10 my grandmother passed away leaving all my siblings and I with CDs. We were not supposed to take the money out until we were 21. I being the youngest and most responsible of my siblings did not even thing about the money until I turned 21. 


When I turned 21 I decided to start looking into getting the money to travel abroad. I had been planning this since I was in high school. I also was planning to give my mom some of the money to help her get on her feet because she was having a hard time at the moment.

After months and months of me pestering my mom for the information to the bank my dad suggested maybe she had taken it. I refused to believe and continued pestering. After another few months I finally came to terms and confronted her. She admitted that yes, she used the money many many years prior. 

She said used it to help with a down payment for the very first house we ever owned and did not rent. Which she had foreclosed  on. 

So yes, it sounds like I should have given my mom a break but when I was about 17 she was making six figures and was taking her and her shit head boyfriend on vacations. 

Since then she has attempted once to pay me back some of the money but the amount she actually owes me is unknown. The bank it was at is unknown. The interest rate is unknown. Its all a total mystery to me. 

The only thing I know was that when I was a teenager we got letters in the mail from the bank and I was never allowed to open it. I once opened one when I was probably 14 and the account had $90 in it. 

I've finally decided I want to take legal measures to get the money back from her. My mom is a deeply messed up person and some parts of me wants to either ask for the money back or for her to get help or a real job. 

Because I don't know how much money she owes me I'm not sure if its worth going to a lawyer for it but I also don't really want to go to small claims court because I'm not sure what that would mean for her and I don't know if my case is valid enough to pursue. 

Any suggestions on if its worth going after or what my next steps should be? 

Also, I'm 24 now if that matters.",finance,1407980400
personalfinance,Complicated financial aid situation. How much should I take out in student loans?,"I was kicked out of my home and disowned by my parents during my final year of high school. A month or so before that, I was accepted to an Ivy League college that meets 100% of the financial need of its students, which is dependent on the income of parents. When applying before I was kicked out, I used my parents' financial information, and my federal aid (Stafford/Perkins loan/grant qualification) and institutional aid (a need-based grant) for my first year were based on these numbers. Under my father's $100k+ income, I had to come up with about $20,000 out-of-pocket and qualified for $5,500 in federal Stafford loans to help cover that. Of course, I didn't have his support at this point, so I worked hard my last year of high school and and that summer and came up with the money for my first year.

However, my father's income increased substantially and I no longer qualified for financial aid, which meant I could no longer come up with the money for school. After a year-long back-and-forth with the financial aid office about my situation, they would not consider my income independent of my father's for institutional aid purposes, but I was ruled federally homeless and therefore qualify for more federal loans this year. Also, they agreed to cap my institutional need-based cost at what it was the first year, with a small increase each year after, so now it's no longer dependent on my father's income.

Because of those rulings, my cost this year is again $20,000. I should also point out that when Cost of Attendance budgets are calculated (used to determine financial need in the eyes of the college), things like personal expenses and a meal plan and a books/supplies are factored in, which add about $7,000 to the 'expected cost'. The meal plan was mandatory my first year, but this year it won't be, and I've learned to live frugally enough that I don't actually use much of the money allotted for those categories. In reality, I'll likely have to come up with about $12-13,000 for the year's tuition+room+fees bill. I also need to cover food and personal expenses, but again, I live on very little.

I am going to finish my summer internship with about $9-10,000 in savings -- about as much as I had this time last year. I spent the entirety on it to cover first-year costs last year (plus the $5,500 Stafford loan and some work during the school year).

However, this year I qualify for much more in federal loans. I can take out up to $10,500 in Stafford loans and $5,500 in Perkins loans. I was also offered loans by the college itself (at the same rate as the Perkins loan) if I needed them.

My current plan is to take out the Stafford and Perkins loans (total $16,000), use them to cover the entirety of my costs this year, and just keep my personal savings in my checking account. I know I can cover the costs with just a few thousand in loans and all my savings, but I'm worried I won't qualify for the loans again next year. The financial aid office told me I have to prove my federal homeless/self-supporting status again each year on the FAFSA, and it was a huge pain to get them to make the homeless ruling this year. I'm making solid money and am living in my own apartment and therefore am not homeless, so I don't know if they will continue to make that decision in my favor, and I can't say for sure if I will qualify for any more than $5,500 in federal loans next year.

I think it is best to take out these loans while I can, in case I can't next year. From what I can tell, if I take out loans now instead of using my savings, the worst that happens is I can pay the loans down upon graduation using the savings that I didn't put towards school. Also, if I continue to work at what I'm doing (instead of doing unpaid research, which I would prefer), I will likely be making significantly more at my internship next year (about $17-20,000 for the summer), which means I might not have to take out this much in loans at all in future years.

**tl;dr: I need to come up with $13-15k/year for school for the next three years. I have ~$10k in savings and can potentially make much more each summer. However, I qualify for $16k in Federal Loans this year that I might not qualify for in future years. Do I take out the loans now and keep my savings (and use them to pay off the loans upon graduation?) or take out a small amount in loans and use the entirety of my personal savings to pay for school?**",finance,1407985918

My Merit Scholarship/Grants: $20,000. 
Federal Loans: 
Direct Unsubsidized- 3,500. Unsibsidized- 6,000. PLUS loan- 4,000. Both have an interest rate of 4.66%

I have a part time job on breaks and in summer at home that I can earn about 1.5-2k in a summer.

The next three years I should receieve the same amount of aid, and federal loans, and personal income. I will not have the life savings I had though. I will however be able to have a cosigner for non-federal loans for the next 3 years (I couldn't get a cosigner this year).

Communications major, assuming I get a job 6 months after I graduate 4 years from now, and assuming I get a starting salary of about 45k

Now that you have the information, here's my questions:
1) Get a credit card? Or naw. Should I start to establish credit this early. Ie: buy my own phone contract and pay for it with credit and use some of my leftover 2k on that

2) I'm gonna have a lot of loans. That really scares me. And a lot of debt, I have mo idea where to start on that, if I should put my remaining money into interest or save for next year

3) Am I screwed with my current path, should I reevaluate and go to a cheaper/closer school?  (I live in PA, but being 5 minutes away from DC provides so much opportunity for a communications major, it helps land a job post grad)

dogecoin,A list of reasons why we should burn some Dogecoin for XDP.,"Please let me know if my points are off.

I don't recommend people burning all their Dogecoin 4 XDP but instead buy new Dogecoin to burn for XDP. Diversify with XDP and hold and use both. If you can't use XDP then save it as an investment until later and sell it to a business that needs it.

Why should we burn some Dogecoin for XDP? 

**Read first:  http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2dj1m2/for_all_confused_shibes_the_easiest_explanation/**

1. It reduces the total supply of Dogecoin which increases it's value.

2. Adds new application value while utilizing the Dogecoin network.

3. edit: XDP is still utilizing the Dogecoin block chain so even though the Dogecoin is lost, it's use has been transformed into a different purpose. 

4. XDP is still utilizing the Dogecoin block chain so in reality the Dogecoin isn't being fully being lost but actually being transformed into another form of use.

5. For people looking for new investment opportunities; Burning Doge to XDP Tokens is better than selling Doge for BTC because it doesn't add to the Dogecoin supply market.

6. It's not really a sacrifice because you are gaining a new asset while protecting Dogecoin Value.

7. Creates new excitement and buzz for Dogecoin.

8. How can it be used?: http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2cja37/can_someone_eli5_dogeparty_xdp_as_well_as_proof/

9. It's a tool not a currency: More here: http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2dh0oj/dogeparty_is_not_a_currency_its_a_tool_that/

10. How it works:  http://www.reddit.com/r/dogeducation/comments/2dftj6/a_simple_overview_of_dogeparty_and_how_it_works/

11. From an application developer perspective, dogeparty actually do a lot of work for you. More: http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2cja37/can_someone_eli5_dogeparty_xdp_as_well_as_proof/cjgddxo

13. How to and how not to use Dogeparty: http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2dizqu/how_to_dogeparty_the_wrong_way/

EDIT:
What are concerns about XDP.

1. XDP in circulation will diminish.

2. In regards to Investing in XDP; Artificial scarcity doesn't automatically increase price. People gotta wanna buy the thing.

3. Lack of tokens available for certain industries..

4. Feels kinda like a parasite has attached itself to Dogecoin.

5. People will think Dogecoin is worthless because people are burning them.



This how understand it so far.   Anything else I can add to the list? or Subtract?




EDIT:  Destroying money to decrease inflation is not a new economic concept. Look at the Federal Reserve: http://www.independent.com/news/2012/feb/25/how-us-federal-reserve-creates-and-destroys-money/

But losing coins while utilizing a new purpose seems like a better idea.

The thing I don't like about DogeParty is it feels kind of like a parasite has attached itself to Dogecoin. But POW-AUX gives me a similar feeling but at least XDP doesn't dump Dogecoin for BTC like most miners do.",cryptocurrency,1407997118
technology,Time Warner claiming Motorola is corrupting SB6121 modem firmware with forced background update.,"Not asking for tech support here - the problem has been resolved. I'm just giving the full background that led up to the technician's claim. 

Tuesday morning, my father's internet connection failed. To determine if the problem was with Time Warner or with his modem (SB6121, less than 6 months old), I brought my own modem (An SB6120) to my father's place and it immediately connected. We'd had a lightning storm the night before and I figured his had simply absorbed some excess voltage and got fried.  

The power, uplink, and downlink lights were all solid green. The connection light was flashing green, and the activity light was intermittently flashing blue. The diagnostic page indicated that initializing baseline privacy was ""In Progress"", and the modem never came to ""Operational"" status. 

Signal page indicated 4 channels with SNR of 34-36dBmV and signal of 6-7dBmV. Unerrored codewords were high and steadily increasing; correctable and uncorrectable codewords were low, fewer than 500, and not increasing. Everything there appeared normal. 

I bought a direct replacement modem, another SB6121, installed it, and called Time Warner to provision it, which they did. I told dad it could take a little while for the changes to propagate, and left. 2 hours later, still nothing, and this new modem is exhibiting the exact same signs as the old one. I exchanged the new one for another new one, same problem.  Remember, my SB6120 worked flawlessly on his lines, but now I've got three SB6121's that have failed. Two is a coincidence; three is (probably) a pattern.

I called up phone support: useless. They said they couldn't see the modem at all and would have to send out a tech. We got a tech out there today, and as soon as the tech saw the model, he said it wouldn't work. **He claimed Time Warner no longer supports that model because Motorola uploaded new, corrupt firmware to the modem.** (It's still on Time Warner's published list of approved hardware, though.) Supposedly, this update had come down from Motorola in the past two weeks.  He claimed that Time Warner techs had been recently briefed that SB6121s were no longer supported and to insist that customers get new modems. 

Using my phone's hotspot, I looked up the cable modems that Office Max had in stock and asked him to recommend one. He suggested the SB6141, so I ran down and picked one up.  He called in the MAC address to provision it, and it was online within 60 seconds. 

While I'm curious as to what the exact cause of the problem might be, I'm more concerned that Time Warner seems to be accusing Motorola/Arris of wrongdoing that Motorola/Arris couldn't possibly be doing.",technology,1408001218
personalfinance,Inflation vs Loan Interest Payments - Don't pay down your loans?,"I've been seeing some strong debates re. the wisdom of paying down your loans vs deferring on paying down on your debt obligations. These debates always become overly complicated with calculations like discounted cash flows, money value and etc.

However, in all my reading, this article [External link](http://loanstreet.com.my/learning-centre/How-Inflation-Affects-Loan-Installments) suggests it is all very simple, and have summed it up into 3 simple rules to follow to always be on top of your money.

1. If loan interest rates are higher than inflation, pay off your Loan 
2. If loan interest rates are lower than inflation, use your money for either:
     a. Investments OR 
     b. Consumption items 
3. In most situations, keep only a minimum amount of cash (in savings / FD etc.)  as your money generally devalues over time (Though there are certain exceptions)

Hey there, reddit.

Another day draws to a close in St. Louis, where riots and protests have been met with escalating police force. With reports of [restricted airspace](http://redd.it/2dfswt), [press arrests](http://redd.it/2dhrd3), and [shifting](http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/17648/web) [police](http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/11732/web) [feeds](http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/11732/web) and [other ground sources](http://redd.it/2diaai) for information, our access to fresh, noteworthy, unbiased developments in the area is at risk.

I'll be kicking off the first of a hopefully brief series of live threads that will depend on the posting user and the \/r/news community's observation of primary and secondary sources, including police feeds, press reports, relevant social media, and field-reporting from local news agencies and groups such as Associated Press and Reuters. I've further explained the purpose and direction I hope these threads will take in a comment below.

I'm not a Missouri resident and likely do not have as good a grasp on the best places to look for information, such as local news or relevant and reputable social media profiles reporting on the situation there. I'll be up for a few hours more, and hopefully somebody more local would be willing to take on the task of starting the next thread. At this hour I doubt that the situation will develop fast enough for me to break the 10,000 character limit and need to start a new thread.

###The situation as it stands
----

Protests and erupted in response to the death of unarmed teenaged Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer on August 9th. Protests started off peacefully near the police headquarters ([reports KMOV](http://www.kmov.com/news/crime/Timeline-of-events-in-Ferguson-270844041.html)), but escalated in anger. This culminated in the looting and vandalism of several businesses. By Wednesday, police reacted with an escalation of force, including militarized SWAT teams, rubber bullets and tear gas. Dozens have been arrested or detained in during this time, notably Washington Post and Huffington Post reporters Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilly (respectively), both briefly detained when police evacuated a McDonalds. Also arrested and still being processed is an Alderman, Antonio French, who has posted numerous video recordings of the events on the street.

###Useful links and resources
----

First, a clarification: The city of St. Louis has it's own police department, separate from the police department which operates in St. Louis County. Ferguson is in St. Louis County and the police activity there is manned by SLCP.

personalfinance,"Laptop, UK: Credit or Save?","Hi PF, 

This is my first post on this sub so apologies for formatting.

My laptop’s been overheating for over a year now (removed chassis, compressed air’d the vents, defragged HDD… all that good stuff) and I’m in need of a new one. I’ve since started full time at my place of work so I have a – guaranteed - monthly income.

I have two options (that I can see as financially viable):

   * Put aside £400 a month into my savings account for 3 months and then buy the laptop

   * Get a credit card with my bank (Interest free for 3 months &amp; no annual fee. 3.6% purchase fee               but that’s okay) and get the laptop now (paying off the total sum before the interest rate kicks in).

I planned on getting a credit card for my monthly bills anyway to increase my credit score so I’m seeing this as a sort of ‘two birds, one stone’ scenario.

Also, by spending £400 a month on my laptop, I’ll still have £100 to go into my savings account after bills.

Thoughts?

**For reference:** The laptop I’m looking at is about £1080 and the credit card limit is £1200

$205 - Health Insurance

$175 - Car/Renters Insurance

$265 - Utilities (Power and Phones/Internet)

$240 - Groceries, avg 60/week

$240 - Husband meals at work, avg $15/day- 4 days a week

$400 - Gas- husband has 45 min commute 4 days a week

$155 - Loan Payment ($2,050 balance, 5% interest)

$345 - Husband car payment ($13,022 balance, 4.75% interest)


We also have a credit card with a balance of $1,900 that we pay as much as we can on it each month. The card is no longer used. Interest rate of 7%.

We have a savings account with $4,100 that we do not touch and add to periodically. I deposit my paychecks into another savings account that we are building for car emergencies, vacation fund, holy-shit-we-need-extra-money kind of situations, and take from that account when/if we need to.

I'm an expat and have an income of $6500 a month tax-free. I have approximately $30,000 of federal student loan debt that I am not paying towards (IBR and $0 AGI). My current employer is a 501(c)(3) entity, so I plan to have the entirety of those loans discharged through PSLF in 8 years. Due to the student loan loop hole, I am unwilling to pay US taxes on my income and am therefore not able to invest in an IRA. 

That said, I am at a loss as to what to do with my savings. I've been keeping it in the bank for the past 2 years, but the amount in there is now over 6 figures and I feel like I should be doing something with it. I have recently started looking at index funds such as VFINX as a way to put my money to work for me. Would this be an appropriate place for the bulk of my money, or should I plan to diversify into other mutual funds/investment vehicles/stocks? Funds such as Fidelity's Select Healthcare Portfolio (FSPHX) have caught my eye, but I worry that they will be much, much more risky than a simple index fund.

personalfinance,Need perspective on the time-value of money (for a down payment on a house),"My wife and I are saving up for a down payment on a house. We're trying to target houses that are no more than $500K but in this part of the country, that doesn't buy much. We would love to be in a place of our own and out of our apartment by this time next year for a number of reasons:

* We're in a tiny 1 BR and don't have a spare room to host family when they visit
* We'd like to start a family soon as well and my wife has made it clear she doesn't want to do it in a tiny 1 BR apartment
* Interest rates will likely start going up next year

We both work and make decent money. If we're aggressive with our savings, we can probably put away $4K per month. Which would mean, come this time next year, we'd only have $48K saved or ~10% down. I've been telling my wife all along that I'd be willing to sell off $50K of stocks I inherited to close the gap but I got to thinking: that $50K is better off in the stock market over 30-35 years for retirement than helping us save 1-2% on interest rates. Now I know 1-2% translates into hundreds of thousands of dollars on a 400K loan, but I'm assuming a conservative 5% growth rate on my stock portfolio over 30 years.

**My question is this - is it dumb to pull money out of the stock portfolio for this purpose?** I figure the smartest thing to do is to just save for another year, but again, my wife is unsure of staying in the same apartment for another year if that's what it means. I've also been thinking about asking family members to loan us the $50K at slightly above market 5-year CD rates (win win as I see it, they get a better payoff than a bank would give them, we pay a lower interest rate than we'd get from a bank for that $50K loan). 

Are any of my assumptions wrong (growth rate of stock portfolio, growth rate of interest rates over the next 2-3 years)?

One other piece of information is that I do have a 401K and Roth IRA, as does my wife, so the stock portfolio is less of a retirement vehicle but it is much greater in value than the 401K and Roth combined.

news,DID OIL PRODUCING STATES MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL OVER OIL?,"Thursday, August 14th, 2014
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

DID OIL PRODUCING STATES  MAKE A DEAL WITH
THE DEVIL OVER OIL?

Do energy companies have a responsibility to mitigate the damage caused by their drilling for oil and gas in Louisiana?  That’s the issue now being litigated in the controversial levee board lawsuits now in the courts.  
Louisiana was seduced by an outside industry full of vast economic promises. The money came in easily and there can be no dispute that many new jobs were created.  But when you put the financial tally to paper, has it been worth it?
A number of Louisiana politicians, including Governor Huey Long in the 1930s, and Plaquemines Parish dictator Leander Perez in the 1950s, made off like bandits by creating family controlled corporations and awarding themselves public oil leases that made them hundreds of millions of dollars.  Oil company cash has flowed into state and local political campaigns for decades.
Perez was particularly aloof from the public interest when he used his political clout to blackmail then Governor Earl Long back in the late 1940s to reject a federal-state split of off shore oil.  President Truman forged a compromise on the federal-state land dispute by offering Louisiana two thirds of all off shore oil out to a three mile boundary, then one third of all production from that point on out into the Gulf. Perez opposed the deal as his “vested interest” made him greedy, and Louisiana ended up receiving not one penny after a protracted battle all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The failure to take this settlement has cost Louisiana, by several studies, more than $500 billion (that’s billon with a “B”) in lost revenue.
Back in the early 70s when I was first elected to the Louisiana senate, 40 percent of the state’s budget came from oil and gas royalties.  This year, some one-billon dollars is budgeted from oil and gas income, but the state budget has grown to $28.5 billion.  So the mineral income is a diminishing return. But still, there’s been a continuing flow of oil money filling the Louisiana state treasury.  But what about the environmental damage left behind? Numerous oil pits and petroleum waste dumps crisscross the state, with a maze of corporations making it often impossible to determine who caused the damage. The hundreds of miles of pipeline cutting through the south Louisiana marsh cause a football field loss of Louisiana land into the Gulf every day. The continuing coastal erosion caused by oil production has dramatically weakened the wetlands hurricane protection system.
History shows that Louisiana and a number of southern states were in the economic doldrums before the advent of oil.  Other Gulf States with no minerals had to create new jobs with the limited resources at hand. Taking the approach that their future economic development was in the heads of their students, these states have jumped ahead of Louisiana in a number of economic and environmental measurements. That’s why universities in surrounding states like Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas are ranked considerably ahead of Louisiana’s academic institutions. They had to use their brain power.  But in Louisiana, it was oil.
Remember the 1950s movie Thunder Bay?   Jimmy Stewart plays an oil wildcatter who discovers oil in the Gulf. When the locals rise up in arms, Stewart makes no bones about what they face.  “There’s oil under this Gulf.  We need it.  Everybody needs it.  Without oil, this country of ours would stop and start to die.  And you would die.  You die,” he tells the crowd.  “You can’t stop progress.  Nobody can.”
Stewart might have been right, but history tells us, time and time again, that with resources and power, there is responsibility.  Did Louisiana accept the riches of the land, but fail to demand that those who set the rules, those who govern, be good stewards of these bountiful resources? Or did the state just stand by, pocket the money, and demand little in protection and environmental accountability?
It may not be completely fair to call it a deal with the devil.  But you have to take the bad with the good.  The bucks have been rolling in for years. And now it’s payback time.  So as the blame game and finger pointing continue, there is plenty of fault to go around.  And that’s what this lawsuit against the oil companies is really all about.

My husband and I were going over our finances last night and decided we'd share with the community and see how you think we are doing, or where we could/should be improving.


We have been married for a little over a year, and have spent a bit of our individual savings getting ourselves established. We also live in a rural area, ~1 hour between any major city.

Anyways, after taxes and 401k deduction, we bring home $2,900 and some change. But for the sake of ease I call it $2,900. My income is salary-based, while my husband is hourly but always gets 40 hours, and usually some overtime. Both of our jobs are very secure, our worries are low to none about one of us becoming unemployed.


Current Monthly Fixed Expenses:

$550 - Rent

$205 - Health Insurance

$175 - Car/Renters Insurance

$265 - Utilities (Power and Phones/Internet)

$240 - Groceries, avg 60/week

$240 - Husband meals at work, avg $15/day- 4 days a week

$400 - Gas- husband has 45 min commute 4 days a week

$155 - Loan Payment ($2,050 balance, 5% interest)

$345 - Husband car payment ($13,022 balance, 4.75% interest)

We also have a credit card with a balance of $1,900 that we pay as much as we can on it each month. The card is no longer used. Interest rate of 7%.


We have a savings account with $4,100 that we do not touch and add to periodically. I deposit my paychecks into another savings account that we are building for car emergencies, vacation fund, holy-shit-we-need-extra-money kind of situations, and take from that account when/if we need to.


Right now our goals are to cut down expenses and get our debts paid off! I hate that we have a loan and credit card and I want them to be gone and never get back in that situation again.
So, any advice on what we could do differently? What we SHOULD do differently?",finance,1408023623

They are owned by Summit Community Bank (FDIC #: 57401). However, searching on the US government's [FDIC website](https://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp), it appears that they're inactive due to the fact that they were merged ""without assistance"" into Horizon Bank.

Does this mean that they're no longer FDIC-insured? Would appreciate any thoughts on clearing this up.

If they're not, it appears that GE Capital and CIT Bank are the next-best options (with 0.95% APY).

Has anyone had experience with the savings accounts in the above FatWallet link, or those listed on [BankRate.com](http://www.bankrate.com/funnel/savings/savings-results.aspx?prods=33)? Since I'm opening a new account, I simply want the one that offers the highest APY and is reputable/reliable/FDIC-insured, and doesn't require any kind of monthly activity like monthly check-writing.

Edit: I understand that interest rates are below inflation these days. However, I am seeking a no-risk place to store savings that offers the best return possible given the circumstances. What would you all recommend?

personalfinance,Can't get the math of my second pay stub to work out.

I worked 80 hours for the pay period at 36.0578 $/hr and received my relocation bonus of $3000. The bonus, I believe, is 3000 gross to me, so I guess the line called 'Relocation Gu' at $4454.31 is correct.

So- YTD regular earning is 5769.25 so far plus 4454.31 for relocation for a total of $10223.56. My Federal Income Tax for this pay stub is 521.48, 2006.85 YTD, which I absolutely cannot figure out how they got. Then my social security tax is 174.21 this stub, with 629.23 YTD. And medicare tax is 40.74 with 147.16 YTD. 

Dental Insurace is 7.5, Health Insurance is 62.77, Vision is 4.45 for a grand net payment of 2073.47. 

The part I am really confused by is the Federal Income tax. Is it different because of my bonus this pay period, or will it always be 521.48 every two weeks? The reason I ask is because the take home pay for the first set of two weeks was 2292.16 and now it is 2073. What gives?

personalfinance,I've lost 10 pounds in 5 days due to worrying about whether I should go through with buying my first house or not. What do you think reddit?,"I am thiiis close buying a house right now, because:
1. I have a down payment saved up ($100k but I hope to not spend it all), 
2. there are still low interest rates on mortgages, 
3. I am 35 years old and with a 30-year loan, I can plan on having it paid off about the time I retire,
4. the seller accepted our super low-ball offer.  (House went on market last November at $425k and they just accepted my $225k offer.  It was initially priced too high but all signs point to this being an excellent deal at $225k: my realtor said so, nicer but smaller houses in same area have been selling in the low to mid 300s, the county assessed its value at $225k, zillow assesses the property value as between $250k-$310k.)
5. My partner and I plan on taking out an additional $100k construction loan to renovate the property, which will make it less ugly and increase the value of the home.

I am at the beginning of my inspection contingency period so I can still get myself out of this over the next few days.  

Our mortgage payments including the construction loan, taxes and insurance will be in the $1700 range.  Our combined income is around $120k...we bring home well over $6k/month after taxes so this should be very affordable for us.


I am leery to buy this house because I tend to be an adventurous person and am experiencing ultra high anxiety (I have lost 10 pounds in the last 5 days) at the prospect of the shackles of debt.  I have lived out of the country for 7 of the last 8 years and still dream of both going back abroad and going to grad school to changing careers - not because I don't like my current career, but just because it sounds like a fun adventure.  We have no kids.

A case could be made that it is still a good investment to buy this house because:
1. If we went overseas, we could almost assuredly rent out the house for hundreds more than our mortgage payment, and the rental income could go towards any upgrades or repairs that the house may need in the future.
2. If I went back to school full-time, we could rent out the house as detailed above and just move into a cheaper apartment, which my partner could afford on his salary alone.
3. Or, if I went back to school full-time, we could get a roommate (it's 4br, 3ba, 2900sqft) pretty easily as it is located close to a major university (Univ of MN), and that could help cover for my lack of income.
4. If all else fails, the house hasn't sold for so long because it was overpriced and ugly.  If we do an awesome job with the renovation (which we will), I think the house would sell for much more than the $325k we would have invested into it.
5. Going through the process of buying the house and especially renovating it is appealing to me as it is an adventure in and of itself.

But, Reddit, I am completely freaking out about going through with this.  What do you say, sound investment or recipe for disaster/unhappiness on my part?

It should also be said that I am debt free and have an excellent credit rating.

That should have been loan in the title, sorry.

I just moved to the US recently and purchased a new car (which, funnily, was MUCH, MUCH easier than getting a 500-1000$ limit credit card.)  

Since I have no credit history in the US, I received a pretty hefty interest rate (~5.5%), but I had no cash on hand in the US, so it was pretty much my only option.

Fast forward 2 months, I have the cash to pay-off the loan completely (I asked the dealership and made sure there was no early payment fee, I think they're illegal in California or something), but I didm't consider the credit implications.  It feels like kind of a dick move since they set that all up and barely collected any interests.

First off the details about my job are. My starting salary is 72k plus a 15% to 30% bonus per year depending on the company performance. Their 401k plan is to match 50 cents for each dollar up to 6% of your pay, (3% of pay). 

The debts I have are as follows

* Student Loan -  $18,500 @ 6.8% interest fixed rate

* Student Loan - $7,500 @ 3.86% interest fixed rate

*  Student Loan - $2,900 @ 12% interest fixed rate

* Credit card - $3,000 and I don't know the interest rate on it but I assume it is much higher than the loans.


Now i do not have a well defined budget yet but here are what I expect my budget to be

* Rent and utilities ~ $1,200 monthly (conservative estimate)
* Food ~ $200 monthly
* Car Insurance ~ $900 per year
* Gas ~ $100 monthly
* Gym ~ $35 monthly
* Bar Tabs and random expenses ~ $200 monthly

personalfinance,23 reasons to retire early and enjoy your life,"*[from my blog - wealthywinters.com/23-reasons-retire-early-enjoy-your-life/. Note that I am from Australia, so the links or references to certain things will have an Australian slant, but the information applies to everyone.]*

So, I don't know how many people know of the ERE lifestyle (retire super early by having very low expenses and having a very high savings rate), but it's something that I love learning about.

One of the biggest things I've noticed is that people seem to have this aversion to early retirement, thinking that they'll be bored, or get sick of free time. I think that's because people associate it with older people stopping work completely, and spending the rest of their life playing golf or sitting in a rocking chair. 

I wrote this to highlight reasons early retirement/financial independence is a great idea, and can also be used as inspiration for thing people might want to do with their free time to enjoy life off a computer and away from the TV (I'm still a net addict, of course, but we don't have a TV).

~ 

The reasons to retire early comes down to one thing: what you can do with your time. If you already enjoy 100% of your time while you’re working, why would you stop?

Moreover, why should retirement be for when you’re 60, or 50, or even 40? Why not consider the idea of retiring at 30? Even if it’s not a financial possibility for you yet, integrating the “retirement is for living a life I enjoy” and “financial freedom is something I want” mindsets can mean you start to integrate this sort of retirement living with how you live now – and encourage you to further save and invest for your own financial independence.

Early retirement isn’t really about stopping working per se; it’s more about stopping doing things just for money. It’s about choosing to live life 100% on your terms. And that’s the purpose of building wealth – not to have lots of money, but to have the freedom to live the life you want.

There are great lists like this one at the simple dollar, which details how to have a money-free weekend (or multiple weekends, if you’re trying to save!). In addition, ERE has a general list of things you can do when you retire. However, I wanted a list of things that would suit the early retiree, or someone imagining themselves retiring in 5 years – what would they want to do, and enjoy, over and over? So much of society is money buying you time – but what if you have all the time you need?

It’s also something to help inspire you to spend your free time better and identify what you do and don’t enjoy. So much of our lives can be taken up with work and chores that some people can’t even contemplate how they would spend a week with truly no obligations at home. This list will get you started (and feel free to add your own ideas in the comments).

If you won’t be retiring any time soon, however, don’t feel like this doesn’t apply to you. This list could and should be something you start to incorporate into your day-to-day life, and help both make the transition to retirement easier (most of these things should cost next to nothing or purely an up-front outlay) as well as more fulfilling. The more time you spend doing things you love, the more you’re motivated to spend more time doing them.

Finally, a lot of items in this list can be turned into things that make money. You can do them for free in retirement, sure, but you can also make money out of them, whether retired or not. My talented father-in-law took up woodwork years ago and makes some of the most beautiful pieces of furniture, including an ornate grandfather clock, that I have ever seen. He has never had any desire to sell his work – but if he wanted to, he could easily find a market for handcrafted furniture and his gorgeous paintings. In addition he paints beautiful watercolours and oil paintings, cooks for his wife and is brilliant at making model trains and planes – and all of this was self-taught (including the woodwork).


**1. Go for a walk.** In the mountains, a national park, around the block, with someone you love or by yourself. Take your kids, go alone, join a group – just go walking. Walking is great for your body, and your mind. It’s a great way to slow down and really just appreciate life. It keeps your body going so that your mind can wander along its own path, and it’s something that almost everybody can do. Here is a brilliant post by director Michael Moore on his walking habit (which now includes thousands of others).


**2. Grow your own food.** There is something really wonderful about knowing that you had the power to sow and reap the food you’re eating. It doesn’t matter if you live in a shoebox or in a concrete jungle; you can still grow something. Currently, Mr W and I have just grown herbs (and a single yearly strawberry which I always forget to pick), but really want to branch out into the foods that we love but can be pricey to buy. I have spinach in my smoothies, so that’s an option; a garden we got for the girls last Christmas has an adventurous tomato vine and some wilted corn that may regenerate next summer. It doesn’t need to be expensive, either; here is a great guide to growing your own veggies on the cheap, as well as a guide to getting started with a container garden.


**3. Visit a museum.** They are usually free and jam-packed with history and knowledge. When we went to the British Museum in London, we had to go back on a different day just to see everything, and even then we had to skim past some areas because it took longer than we expected. Sure, you probably wouldn’t go weekly, but every few months a trip to the museum is a chance to learn something new and interesting. Check out this list of Australian museums on Wikipedia; you may come across some you didn’t know existed!


**4. Read.** Those books you always wanted to read? Why not read them? There is a huge catalogue of these books free online at Project Gutenberg, or if you don’t know where to start, I listed some of my favourite great novels in this post. The only downside to Project Gutenberg is that often they’re only in HTML or text form, which can make them a little rough on the eye, but a brilliant app called readability can be installed as an add-on to your browser or downloaded as an app to read web articles as plain articles, and can also be sent to Kindle (which is also useable on Windows, Mac, apple and android products).


**5. Yoga/flexibility training.** It may seem very hippy-ish or hipster-ish, but doing any sort of training which increases your flexibility is great for your body. Not only does it increase blood flow, it also helps reduce the risk of injury during everyday activities, especially as you get older.


**6. Lift weights.** Don’t stop reading yet. You may think that lifting weights is too difficult, boring, for men or too expensive, but you’re wrong on all counts. First, creating a lifting routine is extremely easy – first, find a weight. It does not need to be a metal weight; you can use a sack of rice, a bag of potatoes or oranges, or anything else. In fact, having a dynamic weight helps you strengthen muscles that generic weight exercises don’t. Once you’ve got your weight, lift it (do some research into lifting so you don’t injure yourself, but generally speaking, lift with the legs, hold your core muscles tight, exhale slowly as you lift and inhale as you release). Weight-lifting is especially beneficial for those over 40, and is great in at least 18 different ways for both sexes. If you think it’s too hard or you can’t be bothered, read this list of quotes from Jack Lalanne, an inspiring man who at age 70 towed 70 rowboats, while handcuffed and shackled, against strong winds, over 1 mile each from one spot to another. He spent his life promoting the idea that anyone and everyone can and should get moving for their own benefit.


**7. Volunteer (either your services or in general).** Volunteering is a great way to make a difference and connect with others who have similar interests to you. Generally, organisations are looking for people who just love the cause, even if they don’t have specific skills – although work out whether you’re actually making a positive difference when you join. Organisations are often looking for reliable, regular volunteers – but if you have a specialised set of skills (such as accounting), you may be able to work for them on an intermittent basis.


**8. Share or sell what you know.** Humanity has grown not just because we’re “smarter” than most animals, but because of something Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen term extelligence - basically the social network of knowledge we have. Most people do not know how to build a computer, how a microwave works, or how to assemble a car from metals in the ground, but extelligence helps us grow as a species. Sharing what you know through a platform like wordpress (which is what I use) can be a great way to share what you know with the world. It doesn’t have to be for profit, but if your skills are highly sought after, you might want to turn to tutoring or teaching in some form.


**9. Learn a skill to help others.** A recent study showed that one in three parents would not know what to do if their child needed CPR – but even those without children should learn a vital skill like this. Learning basic first aid, having a first aid kit for humans and animals in the car, and knowing how to cope in an emergency like a bush fire, cyclone, blackout (well, not so much an emergency) or other urgent situation will not just help you, but those around you.


**10. Learn a skill to help yourself.** How many things in your life do you pay someone to do that you could do, if only you invested the time and effort? Mowing the lawn, cutting your hair, making a gourmet meal, ironing your clothes, painting your nails, changing the oil in your car, growing food – a lot of these are easily achievable by the average person with some time and effort. For those who have “retired”, there is plenty of time to practice these skills to improve the quality of your life and save yourself from spending on things you can already do.


**11. Learn a foreign language.** While this may seem difficult, if you really want to learn a language and would like to travel to a country (or countries) that speak it, there are lots of ways to get more of it into your life. Watch the news in French, Greek, Filipino, Hindi, Chinese, German, Spanish, Arabic or Turkish on SBS on weekdays. Join your local language community, such as the Alliance Français or the Polish Community. By finding ways to immerse yourself in the language, you can learn it more quickly than you think – but if you want to learn as you go, Benny the Irish Polyglot has amazing adventures as he picks up new languages in 30 days on his travels.


**12. Breathe properly.** Despite it being seemingly obvious, many Westerners do not breathe properly. Learn, and your body will improve.


**13. Watch and appreciate the seasons.** There are four of them every year, but how often do you truly stop to notice? In winter, do you take the time to appreciate the wind and the rain, while you curl up inside in the warmth and enjoy a hot drink? Do you ever let that rain touch your skin, even go so far as letting yourself get caught in a downpour once in a while? In spring, do you pay attention to the plants and flowers, watching as the new shoot spring up from the earth? Is summer spent trying to get the house Antarcticly cold, or do you try to spend time soaking up the warmth under shady trees, sipping icy drinks? Do you note the changing of colours through autumn, as the trees turn, and relish the lingering sun? Taking the time to appreciate this can give you a whole new perspective on the year.


**14. Learn a practical craft.** This can be things that you can do for enjoyment, but yield practical results: metalwork, woodwork, making soaps, plumbing, general carpentry, basic electrics, making baby clothes. These are things that you can give as gifts for others, sell, or use for yourself.


**15. Go camping.** Camping can be a really great way to get out and appreciate the seasons, as well as spend time with yourself or a loved one (as per other items on this list). Initially, you’re up for the cost of a tent and a sleeping bag or a swag, plus a portable stove if you need hot water, but the rest can be improvised and learnt on your first trip (that’s what we did, with a three-month old baby in tow) – you may even find you can borrow these things. Start out in the milder months (October, November, December and March) to get a feel for camping before weathering more extreme conditions, but don’t judge your trip by just one experience – choose interesting places and do some research on things to do while you’re away.


**16. Learn an instrument.** An instrument doesn’t have to be expensive or something that requires lessons; in fact, having more time means you can practice a lot more instead of paying someone to teach you. There are often cheap courses at community houses for things like guitar or piano, but there are also a lot of online videos, too. Don’t forget that your voice is also an instrument. Music is beautiful, and being able to create it by yourself or with others is magical.


**17. Learn to preserve fresh fruit and vegetables.** Something you will most likely end up needing to do once you have a garden going for a few years is learn to preserve the excess fruit and vegetables your garden produces – this means you can have supplies throughout the year despite a seasonal yield. Even if you don’t have a garden, going to places like berry farms in season, picking your own (at a cheaper rate than most supermarkets) and then freezing them or preserving them is a great way to make them last. The options include making jams and chutneys, flash freezing, making relish, dehydrating, and more.


**18. Get a free degree.** Not an official qualification, as they cost money, but the learning behind an actual degree. Once you retire, what are important are the skills you have and what you know, not what other people think a piece of paper implies you know. MIT has a huge number of their courses online, while Coursera offers free online courses from over 80 institutions (which you can choose to pay to get an official certificate for).


**19. Spend time with yourself.** This sounds like it’s very simple, but how much time in a week or a month do you actually spend just with yourself? Not doing chores, or commuting, or running after kids, but just sitting (or standing or walking or cycling) by yourself, alone with your thoughts? Practice doing this when you can – set aside a block of time, just for you. Make a nice drink, if you like, and then just watch the world go by and listen to yourself think.


**20. Spend some time with someone you love.** Like the above step, this is something we forget to do all too often. We may be in the same place at the same time with them, but that’s not the same as just doing something together. Choose a hobby on this list and learn it together. Go for a walk together. Play together (yes, Mr W and I still play silly games like kids). Value the time you have each other.


**21. Get to know your city.** This may sound boring, or something you’ve already done, but if you live anywhere near a capital city in Australia (or a city of a million+) then I can almost guarantee that if you haven’t lived homelessly in the CBD, you haven’t seen all of it. You can wander the streets alone or with a friend, duck into old alleyways and see what’s down them, sign up for notifications about festivals and free events and generally just start spending time in all the nooks and crannies that big places create. Even if you don’t live near a city, this can be a great place to take a train to to spend a day wandering – grab a backpack, fill it with food and water, and you can imagine you’re a tourist in a different country (well, almost …).


**22. Learn an advanced skill.** This overlaps slightly with learning a practical skill, so it really depends to what level you want to take it – an advanced skill could be learned from a TAFE (i.e. a trade) or from joining a club that practices for free. The more advanced your skill, the more potential there is for you to do it professionally.


**23. See your country (or another country)** – Think outside the box for this. It can be acamp/drive sort of affair which is very cheap, and it can involve multiple forms of transport. You can even find cool things like campervan relocations for which you pay $1 to drive a van from one city to another (or more) – all you have to supply is the petrol (and often they throw in a small voucher towards it). The only catch is you do have limited time, as shown on their site, but it’s good for long drives like Adelaide to Alice Springs if you’re interested.


This list isn’t comprehensive, but it’s hopefully a good start to getting your brain ticking over. The most important thing is getting value out of your life every day doing things you love. A lot of these skills are useful in multiple ways, and often very practical – quite a few will even save you money despite a small upfront cost.",finance,1408067290

personalfinance,"""How to invest"" for Americans abroad (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, Roth IRA, Capital Gains tax topics)","Hi all,

A little back-story... Been living in Singapore for 5 years. Two years ago I tried to get a mutual fund. Found out the bank and all banks reject Americans for investments because of the complicated worldwide taxes. Turns out we can only buy American incorporated mutual funds or we get taxed out our bums.

No problem, I can find another way to grow my money. 

Thanks to my accountant, learned about Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. So since i make less than $95K(USD), i do not need to pay federal income tax. YAY more money! :)

However, I think this also prevents me from contributing to a Roth IRA (i don't have one yet). 

Two options i am considering:

**Scenario 1** 

* Do not take the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. 
* Pay federal income tax on my $37KSGD (Approx $29KUSD) 
* Open a Roth IRA 
* Buy mutual funds or other investments using the Roth IRA vehicle 
* Let it grow


**Scenario 2**

* Continue to claim FEIE (No Fed income tax)
* Open a brokerage account (online?) in the US
* Pay 15% on capital gains only. 






So the question is, which scenario could grow more money? I guess it depends on how much my investments would earn (scenario 2). But in general is there a ""better one""? Also are there other options? Am i analyzing my situation incorrectly?

I plan to stay in Singapore for another 5 years or so. Unfortunately for me, Locals have something called CPF. My understanding is it is the S'pore equivalent of a 401K. I don't have this so I'm making my own way! :) I have a liquid savings of less than 10K(SGD), and in addition contribute monthly to a variable life insurance in the US (Thanks mom for opening it when i was a kid) However the amount of money for this variable insurance must be capped after one more year! Our accountant advised us that i can contribute to a certain amount, after that will be taxed. It's okay with me, but i obviously need to diversify and check out what else i can do to have a healthy retirement. I am interested in stocks and online investment (have been researching) and would like to begin this year. 

Just a broad disclaimer, I'm not an expert so any info above, feel free to challenge it! Thanks and i'm a fan, personalfinance!",finance,1408076458

personalfinance,Starting a Roth IRA at 18 as a dependent. What actions are necessary?,"A friend of mine works as a waiter at a restaurant in California where he's earned about $4200 before taxes in salary and tips. Tips are all reported to the employee and then divided out among employee groups, and waiters get 10% of the tips split among themselves. His pay stubs list his gross pay (salary + tips so no tax fraud here) minus: 

* SS/ Medicare tax

* Federal income tax withheld (around 10% of gross)

* State income tax

* State disability insurance

* Tips which are paid out in cash every shift

He plans on working for 2-4 weeks before quitting his job, thus bringing his gross earned income to about $5000, give or take several hundred. If he were to open an IRA at Vanguard, are there any important notes regarding taxes as a dependent, choosing the right investments, and maximum contribution limits that would be helpful to know? He's already got plenty of money and his college will be paid for by his parents, and he also has around 40k sitting in his bank account that he has nothing to spend on, so opening an IRA sounds reasonable to me.

From I understand, he can contribute as much as he makes before taxes (earned income), and that he might have to file a 1040 tax return (he was not planning to when I brought up the point with him, doesn't even know what a W4 or 1040 is), but confirmation or correction would be much appreciated. Given that he also will be heading towards college and not be able to contribute enough to satisfy Vanguard's minimums for a 3 bond portfolio for the foreseeable future, what would a good allocation for his funds?

On a related note, I'm only 17 as well and about to start college. What major financial decisions and ""investments"" can college bound kids starting off life at a financial advantage (wealthy parents who pay for everything through college and possibly for a little while afterwards) make in order to make our futures easier? I'm fairly sure we've got the academics and social life locked in, and neither of us have any financial bad habits given that we have constantly growing checking accounts from not spending whatever cash our parents give us (we also have basic credit cards that we hardly ever use). Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1408081797

Bitcoin,In need of some insight regarding bitcoin,"I posted this to r/BitcoinBeginners and was afraid I wouldn't get much of a response. If this doesn't belong here, mods feel free to remove it. I don't wish to enrage a unique reddit community, I only wish to ascertain knowledge from people with bitcoin experience.

""Greetings bitcoiners! I consider myself a noob to the concept of bitcoins, although I have been interested in the whole idea of them for some time. I first came across BTC after reading an article about Silk Road and the arrest of DPR. Since that time I have become increasingly aware of the potential for this crypto currency. Being a college student on the quest for knowledge and always wanting to be a part of the new fad, I found myself fascinated with bitcoin. I never have much luck posting in other places on reddit so I have become a lurker (Yes I know, I'm a fedora tipping piece of scum). Following are a few general questions I have regarding BTC and I'm hoping this very unique reddit community will be able to shed some light on this topic for me.

-It is my understanding that BTC is generally considered to be quite volatile. What exactly influences the increasing/decreasing of the price of BTC?

-I see now that some retailers are catching on to the idea of using bitcoin for payment. Do you think that this trend will continue, and is this a step in the right direction for the currency?

-Are there any sort of regulations that are being proposed for BTC. Any speculation on how this might work?

-I often see ""tipping"" threads where people are essentially giving away BTC to others, is this really a thing? As a guy with a wallet that is currently empty, is there any sort of contributions to this community that I can make that result in this tipping? 

-Bitcoin mining seems to be a trend nowadays and some people are spending a large sum of money to set up ASIC bitcoin mining machines. Is this practical? Because I hear the odds of finding a packet with 25 or so bitcoins is slim to none. Say you spent 5,000 dollars setting up a mining rig, are the possible returns on your investment worth the money spent? Or is this a kind of hobby for some tech savvy folks?

-Final question, I have some family members that have decent sums of money put away, and are considering acquiring bitcoin as a sort of ""investment"". Since it is considered so volatile, is this sort of investment a bad idea on their part, and what sort of advice or opinions would you all give to them?

I thank you all in advance for any input you might have to offer me, and I hope that one day soon I might know enough about BTC to answer some future noobs questions!""",cryptocurrency,1408111267

personalfinance,"Wife and I are selling the house to move in with her parents and save for a downpayment. Where's the best place to park our income to make it work the hardest and get the best ""bang for our buck""?","As the title states, we are in the process of selling our house, and if all goes according to plan, we will walk away not owing anything with both of our credit scores intact. Our house is/was a little upside down, but we are confident we can sell and get out without owing anything to anyone. 

That puts us in a situation where we will be living with her parents. It will cut back on a lot of our bills (the biggest being the mortgage payment that will no longer exist) and help us save money. I estimate that I will be able to save about $3,500 a month. The plan is to do this for 18 to 24 months, so that when we're ready to buy our next home we would have anywhere between $63K and $84K for a down payment.

personalfinance,"Could someone please explain to me in simple terms the differences between these types of loans (Dl Special Consol Stafford, Direct Sub Stafford Loan, etc.)?","Over time I have saved up enough money to be able to pay off a substantial amount of my student loans, but not quite all of it yet.  As of right now these are the loans I have remaining, their types/amounts.  I am trying to figure out which would be the best to pay off first.  Obviously I am aware interest rate is probably king here, but since I am a school teacher I don't want to pay off a loan that could be forgiven later (unless it was a ridiculous difference in interest, but most of mine are in the 4-5% range).  Or should I say, I would prefer to keep them as my lowest priority, and pay off the ones that I absolutely cannot get forgiven.

personalfinance,"""What is the best savings account?"" seems to get asked quite frequently so I thought I would share my experience attempting to answer this. Warning: Long post. Spoiler: It's Ally","I’ve had a bit too much time on my hands as of late so Ive taken to a new obsession: finding the perfect bank. My initial foray lead me to seeking out the perfect checking account. After a brief stint with Simple (you can read more [here](http://intn.se/post/94214278100/sorry-simple-but-i-have-to-leave-you)) I settled on Charles Schwab. Although Schwab is nearly perfect, I realized it was lacking in one thing: a high-yield savings account. Oh, it does have a savings account with that exact name, the Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Savings account, but the actual interest rate is somewhat laughable, a paltry 0.12%. I then focused my obsession on finding a savings account with a more acceptable interest rate. Granted, current interest rates, even on CD’s, are a pittance of what they used to be, but I became determined to make my money work for me.

I turned to nerdwallet.com, bankrate.com, and personalfinance.reddit.com to see what my options were. I quickly realized there were an abundance of choices, so I first needed to narrow down exactly what I was looking for. My  ideal savings account had three requirements. First, it needed the highest interest possible (duh). Next, I didn’t want  to deal with max-deposit caps, to retain maximum usability so accounts like the Barclay Dream Account (0.95% APY) were ruled out. Lastly, I didn’t want to have to work for my interest, ruling out some credit unions which offered high interest rates if there were a certain amount of deposits / withdrawals a month. 

With these constraints in mind, a few front-runners became apparent: Synchrony Optimizer +, Capital One 360, and Ally. So with that, the Savings Account Throwdown began.

**Synchrony Optimizer +** (0.95% APY)

From my research, Optimizer Plus was the clear front runner in regards to interest, so I decided to start there. I couldn’t find anyone with any actual experience with this bank, but I couldn’t avoid the lure of the high interest rate. The signup process and first deposit was simple. Upon signing into my account for the first time, it became clear the the reason their interest rate was so high is because they skimped on everything else. The website was severely lacking, in terms of features and polish. It was the definition of bare-bones. Which is a shame, as its your only option since they don’t offer an accompanying app (so much for check deposit). But who cares about polish when your bank account can generate all that sweet cash (ok, pennies) off the high interest. 

I wanted to test out making some deposits and withdrawals to see how smooth the process was, so after my account was cleared and the ACH was set up, I made my first deposit which went smoothly. The next day, I made a withdrawal and everything came screeching to a halt. I got a notification that my account was locked. So I called the support and got connected to a very friendly girl who explained that my recent change of address had raised a flag. Ill spare you the long story, but after spending hours on the phone both with her and her manager, then her colleagues and their managers (after promised call-backs never came), during a week of attempting to unlock my account (and gain access to the money I had justdeposited), it became clear that something wasn’t right with them. On my final phone call, I was told my account was finally unlocked. I made the person wait on the phone while I attempted a withdrawal which yet again which (surprise) failed. It was at that point that I realized even if I ever got access to my account again, I had lost all faith that this wouldn’t happen again. I can’t afford to go weeks without access to my savings account. I told them to cancel my account and transfer my money (which I finally received a week later).

**Capital One 360** (0.75% APY)

After my awful experience with Synchrony, I was leery to try just any savings account so I wanted to try something that was well-known. 360 gets a lot of accolades, and Mint keeps telling me to set up an account. I asked someone to send me a referral and I was up and running. I would be lying if the $25 sign-up bonus wasn’t the main reason I joined (which will probably be way more then I will earn in interest this year anyway so Im already ahead!). 

It quickly became apparent that the 360 website was lightyears ahead of Synchrony and seemed designed to work with Mint (which would explain their multitude of ads all over the site). They make it extremely easy to set up auto-transfers (what they call “automatic savings plans”) as well as goals (i.e. “save for a car”), which go nicely with accompanying Mint features. They also support (and encourage) setting up multiple accounts (up to 25) so that each goal can be segregated into its own account. Its perfect for someone trying to save money (that’s why you have a savings account, right?). If you are an ardent Mint user, its a dream. Its clear 360’s focus is on saving for the future, which leads to one minor quibble: their phone support is great and super helpful but they refer to you not by your name, but instead call you “Saver” as in “Hello, Saver, how can I help you today?” Its just….weird. 

The security of the site is one thing I’m torn on. One feature I really like, and wish more sites would adopt, is the ability to create read-only access codes you can use with specific sites (*cough* Mint *cough*). What I don’t like is that they do not support passwords. Rather, whenever you login you type in your username and then click a 6-digit code into a virtual keypad. In addition to being less secure (I prefer 20-digit random passwords for all my important sites), it means logging in is really annoying and won’t work with programs like 1-Password. I would also love if they supported 2-Factor Authentication but I can’t have everything, can I? 

Their iPhone app is also pretty nice. It gets the job done, although it is a bit cluttered as it has   buttons all over the place for features I don’t have access to (such as checking). But it gets the job done. 

One other bonus for Capital One 360 that is worth mentioning is that, unlike most other High-Yield accounts, they actually have physical branches which means when you need to actually deposit cash, you can.

All in all, 360 is great. If you use Mint, its perfect. But my thirst for the perfect savings account wasn’t quenched. Onto the next one.

Ally is another bank that kept popping up as a promising option so that seemed like a good place to go for my next bank. After setting up my account (which was easy, as I came to expect), the first thing I realized was that they take their security seriously. They have 3  awesome features that I really like. First, they allow long and complex passwords.  Second, they offer (rather, require) 2-Factor Authentication, a feature I have been dreaming of for my bank accounts. Last, and my favorite, is that they ask you to choose a secret question and answer. Normally, banks usually have you choose a secret word they can ask to authenticate you so when you call, if you don’t say the correct word, they will lock the account. Ally takes it one step further and allows you to choose the question that will prompt your secret word. It doesn’t add any extra security but can lead to hilarious consequences. As a result, whenever I call into support now, they have to ask me: “What are you wearing?” (Eugene Mirman fans will appreciate this). 

So before I have even logged in, they have me sold. Above all else, when it comes to my life-savings, Security is something I take seriously. Upon actually logging it, I was greeted with a pleasant website. They didn’t skimp on polish. The site is easy to navigate and well designed. One feature I really like is how easy they make it to reach support. On the top, they offer the current wait time to reach someone via phone (I never saw it longer then 3 minutes), as well as a button to reach chat support, which has become my favorite thing ever, since banking with Schwab, since I hate talking on the phone.

The App is equally well designed (the best designed app I have used apart from Simple) and allows you to quickly accomplish anything you would need to do, from transfers to check deposits. No excessive features here.

It seems like I might have actually found my perfect savings account. I can’t really come up with a complaint about them so far (granted I have only had them for a week). My only criticism I can come up with (and I am reaching) is that they don’t offer the Mint-oriented features like access codes that 360  offers.

The claims form makes it seem like they are going to reimburse us, but doesn't seem likely. I've heard that the state of emergency might open up low-or-no-interest federal loans for residents, but I can't find anything to back that up.

personalfinance,Opening a new credit card - effect on credit score?,"First post here; couldn't find this question in the FAQ.

I’m 22 years old, working full-time. The only debt I have is student loans, which enter repayment in December 2014 and February 2015. I have a few hundred dollars on a credit card from when I was unemployed, but I always made payments and that will be gone when I start getting paychecks from my two jobs. I've never gotten an official score report, but all my accounts are in good standing and I have under 30% utilization of my credit lines (I have a small balance on my Visa from that period of unemployment, currently accruing 0% interest. I spend responsibly, but it's not like gas becomes free just because you're job hunting!)

I currently have three credit cards, and am an authorized user on my parents’ card. I have two store cards for my favorite clothing stores, and pay the balance in full every month. I literally use them like my debit card, and only buy something if I have the cash to pay the bill right away. I like the benefit of not carrying cash, the rewards I get, and avoiding a possible overdraft due to an automatic payment or payroll error.

My three cards (where I am the only user) are:
-	Citi Visa: $5000 limit. Low interest rate starting in October (it’s 0% right now); earns points for Amazon and gift cards, etc.
-	Kohl’s: $2000 limit. Never carry a balance, gives me an extra 20-30% off every time I shop.
-	Victoria’s Secret: $1107 limit. Never carry a balance, gives me $15 in free money for every 250 points. 

I am an authorized user on my parents’ Citi MasterCard. This has a $25,000 limit, and my dad always pays the balance in full. Both of my parents have credit scores over 800, so I know for a fact that they maintain good standing on this account.

I am getting married next year. My fiancé also has fantastic credit He’s 22, and didn’t need a cosigner for a low-interest car loan. We will want to buy our own place at some point in the future – at minimum, a year and a half away.

I want to open one more credit card, to increase my amount of available credit. We do a huge chunk of our shopping at Target, and I want to take advantage of the extra 5% off you get when you use a Target card. This card would obviously be paid in full as well, so interest rates don’t matter to us.

How long does a pull like this affect my credit score, and is now the best time to open this account? I don’t want to lower my credit score for when we apply for a mortgage together in the future.

TLDR version:

Shiller’s CAPE may have to be adjusted from an historical median 17x P/E to something resembling 20-22x. That would not mean that today’s 16-multiple P/E market should be elevated to an immediate 20x, but that the current CAPE of 25x, as shown in Chart 1, is less bubbly than presumed. Fed officials who cite bubbly aspects of “financial conditions” should therefore be less alarmed. If the real New Neutral is significantly lower than 10 or 20 years ago, P/E ratios should be higher, credit spreads should be tighter, and home prices less bubbly than presumed if, in fact, The New Neutral is “neutral” and can lead to historical levels of asset volatility.",finance,1408126558

After taxes, I take home about 2k a month (before taxes it's like 3k-3.5k); I'm supposed to be making 41k a year before taxes at my job, but it's hourly and we've been short-staffed so lately I've been making more. But I did put 41k on my credit application. My rent is 800 plus bills/electric/etc.

personalfinance,"In case you were thinking of trying out Simple Bank, I'll spare you frustration. They suck. Stay away.","So I just saw [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2dpily/rent_check_didnt_go_through_to_my_apartment_now/) post on the front page, about OP using Simple which lead to him being late on rent. I almost had the exact same thing happened. I tried Simple a month or two ago, and did a write-up afterward. Figured I would share it here in case anyone was curious about the ""bank"".

I’ve been using a credit union from a place I used to live as my primary bank for a few years. Although it was nice for a while, I got fed up with their terrible website and app and decided I wanted to find something better. I kept hearing about Simple and was intrigued about their app-centric approach to banking, considering every bank app I and ever used was beyond terrible. I “applied” on their website and waited on pins and needles for a few days (ok, I may be exaggerating but it was the first time I was excited to join a flipping bank) until I got my acceptance email. 

Once I was set up, I decided I wanted to get the full experience and jump in with both feet. Once I received my debit card in the mail (a matte white card that was quite striking, very apple-esque), I decided to do 100% of my transactions through Simple for a month. Well, the month is over so I thought I would share my impressions. Spoiler alert: the Simple card won’t be staying in my wallet. 

**First, the positives:**

* The App is amazing and worlds apart from any other banking app, although that isn’t saying much considering how terrible most apps are. The website is quite pleasant to use as well with Mint-like budgeting features. 
* The card, as I mentioned, is quite striking. I got a few comments about it in the short time I used it, for whatever that is worth. I am a sucker for good design. 
* Safe-to-Spend can be pretty handy. Simple takes into account upcoming payments, as well as current Goals (more on that later), and deducts it from your current balance so you don’t think you have more in your account then you actually do.
* Goals are pretty sweet. You can set up a future goal (say a iPhone 6) and allocate a certain amount each month that Simple will take out of your Safe-to-Spend amount, which makes savings money super easy. 
* Paying people is also super easy with their fluid app interface, if that is something you use often.

**But the positives weren’t enough to outweigh the negatives.**

* The interest rate is a joke. Granted, interest rates in general are a joke but Simple makes other banks look like they are throwing money at you. So low, they don’t even list it but just refer to it as “nominal.” In the month I had them, I got a penny. If you are looking for a high-interest account, check out my savings account throw down [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2dn7vg/what_is_the_best_savings_account_seems_to_get/)).
* Free ATMs. Simple makes a big deal about their partnership with Allpoint, “the countries largest free ATM network.” Well, thats fine and dandy but the network is paltry compared to what most other online banks offer, which is ATM reimbursement for any ATM. And Im quite spoiled since Schwab in particular offers unlimited reimbursements for ATMs worldwide. After going up to any ATM I want, its a bit of a bummer to have to fire up the Simple app to find a in-network ATM.

* Bancorp, The bank Simple is paired with (Simple isn’t actually a bank but rather just fancy software) isn’t compatible with checks. Let me say that again. My Simple Checking account doesn’t support checks. What in the hell? If I want to pay for something with a check, my only option is sending a check through bill pay, which takes on average 5 days. It is literally impossible to give someone a check any sooner then that. I almost missed rent because of this handy feature. When I called up to see what the could do, they actually recommended using my old checking account. What is simple about that? 
* The aforementioned Mint-like budgeting features, as cool as they are, became really pointless after the honeymoon period wore off and I realized I don’t  actually do many transactions with my debit card (and you shouldn’t, either) and what Simple can do, I can also do with Mint…but for all my cards.

* One thing Simple prides its itself on is how easy it is to reach a human being if you need help. But I actually found their phone support really annoying, due to the amount of verification questions they had to ask EVERY time I called. And I spent quite a lot of time holding for a person on at least one occasion. Not impressed.  They also have a messaging feature which works fine, but pales in comparison to the ability to instantly reach someone via IM with banks like Schwab and Ally.

All in all, I really can’t see a good justification to use Simple. Although they preach simplicity, their “features” like free ATMs lack of checks complicated my life much more then other online banks like Schwab. Seriously, if you don’t support basic things like checks, you have no business calling yourself a bank. 


**edit:** So Ive gotten some some shitty messages and aggressive replies that are not called for, along with this thing blowing up much more than I expected (which is great) so I thought I would write something here then let it be. I guess I have touched some nerves. 

First, I realize in retrospect that my title of this was a bit aggressive and uncalled for, so let me apologize for that. My point in writing this wasn't to say that Simple was a terrible bank that should be avoided at all costs (which I realize completely contradicts my title, again..I apologize. I had no sleep when I posted it). My aim was to give a realistic overview on my experience after using it as (I think) normal user for a month, so people could get an idea of what its like without the hassle of using it. When I first tried to look into Simple, all I could find is reviews raving about how amazing it was and how it would completely change the face of banking forever. Not a single review mentioned a lot of the shortcoming I think it has. As it stands now, I don't think there is a single compelling reason to use it, assuming you don't use debit for every transaction, which I firmly believe you shouldn't ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kt8qd/lets_get_some_good_information_out_there_about/) is a good post detailing why.)  And if you *do* use only credit, there is not a single thing that Simple offers IMO that makes the rather glaring short-comings worth it. I think Simple is promising, but as it stands now its not that great when you make an honest  comparison against other similar online banks such as Schwab and Ally. Perhaps in a year or two, it will be compelling. But not now.",finance,1408193335

My rates for my student loans vary widely, sometimes my parents co signed, other times not, but on average my rates for my student loans are about 9%, which I know is very high. I am thinking about switching to a bank in my college town, because the bank I have now is an hour a way, and it just is not convenient for me anymore. Should I refinance with my new bank, which will probably give me a higher interest rate but will lower my monthly payments drastically and use that extra money to put towards my student loans to start paying off some of the higher interest rate stuff. Any advice would be helpful, on one hand I do not want to lose my low interest car loan, but on the other I do not like the idea of racking up so much interest on my student loans.",finance,1408194007

personalfinance,My painful experience with large credit card debt,"I reached a max of $80k in cc debt and it was unbearable.  It was really destroying my life in many ways and made me realize how toxic it can be to let it get out of control.  I'm down to $35k now and will get there.  I'm sure many people are in the same (and worse) situations.  

I also did not want to destroy my credit in the process.  I still had pretty good credit.  I was not missing payments, but I was slowly sliding into a situation where I would soon miss payments, if I couldn't get a hold of the situation. 

I wanted to get out of debt, keep my house, and keep my credit.  Basically, not destroy my family's life.  Most financial advice is the same old crap, and I had to try out different methods to find out what worked and what didn't.  This is what I learned.

* Make a budget.  This is pretty useless advice.  I know how to add and subtract and so I know how to make a budget.  I'll save you the 'spend less, get a 2nd job' advice as well.  That should be obvious.

* Student debt.  My understanding creditors are much tougher with student debt, so I would be looking to transfer that into another form of debt where the rules are not so awful for the borrower, for instance Wells Fargo offers up to a $25-30k personal loan.  The interest rate (13% in my case) was not great, but this would be good for consolidating higher rate balances or paying off debts like student debts.  From what I understand about the rules with student debt, I'd try to get clear of it asap.  If you can bear the increased minimum payments, get it transferred into another type of debt with different rules about default, etc..

* Big interest credit cards.  There is no way you should be paying over 10-15% interest on credit cards, even if they've already been closed out.  Next to student loans, high interest cards are the most obnoxious form of debt because they lock you in for many years.  Here's how I dealt with it.

Call the credit card company.  You don't have too be Ricky Roma salesperson with these people on the phone.  I am not.  Like most people, I am uncomfortable with confrontation and more than a little intimidated on the phone with a huge bank trying to negotiate.  You don't have to.  You just ask to have the interest rate reduced.  Document your hardship however they need to have that, but absolutely do this and call back once a month for each card.  They should get you at least to the mid-teens in interest rate and the goal here is to get interest rates to the bare minimum without defaulting on the debt.

Once you've gotten all you can out of the previous method, I personally went to a debt management agency.  I looked for a non-profit personally, but in short here's the deal you get.  You open an 'account' with them and select cards &amp; debts that are part of the account.  Those accounts are closed with the banks, so you can't use the cards anymore.  They reduce the interest rate and I had great success with this.  They reduced the rate on two of my cards to 2% and 1%.  They brought everything else down to below 10%.  It will vary by card, and some banks don't accept - but this was huge for me.  It totally shifted my monthly payments to principal and I really started to gain traction in paying down the balances.

Here's the kicker, it did not hurt my credit.  I had a few cards with zero balances that I did not put into the program.  My debt cards accounts were closed but once that happened they no longer were part of the utilization equation.  So for cards, this equation is balance divided by total credit limit.  When they closed the cards, those balances were no longer part of the equation, so my credit score DID NOT go down.   I would recommend the debt management route if you can't squeeze any more interest rate reductions out of the banks (and you are ok with closing the accounts from future use).  I kept a couple cards out of the program and open with zero balances, for emergencies.  I showed 0% utilization, my credit score WENT UP.

* Payoff strategy.  I personally payed minimum payments and anything else I could pay - the highest interest balances first.  Every month you're paying interest and that is wasted money.  I transferred balances when I was (rarely) able to get offers as well, and got my effective interest rate on all the debt from 12% down to 4% overall.  This was huge and only after that happened, did I make real progress on paying down the principal.

* Mortgage.  Also wanted to stay in the house, which was/is deeply underwater and mortgaged way over 100%.  When you're underwater like this, no bank will refinance you, so even though prevailing interest rates are falling, you can't take advantage if you're in a fixed rate mortgage.  I used the gov't HARP program for this (Thanks Obama!).  Problem is, interest rates kept falling so much two years later it made sense to refi again to drop the interest rate.  You can only do the HARP program once, so I went to the bank.  Documented hardship, and on and on.  It was a several month process but they refi'd me.  I'm not crazy about the terms (basically a 40 year mortgage to lock you into a lifetime of wage slavery), but it did ease the burden so I can focus on the credit card debt.

Please understand and learn from my pain.  DEBT IS TOXIC.  Using credit cards to live beyond your means and other irresponsible actions with money can have terrible consequences, so be aware.",finance,1408207372

Why has the relatively expensive forwarding-based method of i2p and tor caught on but the non-deterministic routing method of ant networks fallen by the wayside?

Is there something about ant routing that compromises anonymity?",cryptocurrency,1408208753
Bitcoin,Bitcoin Credit Thoughts,"I had this idea and want to put it out there to see if other people agree it would improve adoption for customers (as opposed to merchants). 

A company that offers bitcoin credit, essentially on-demand micro loans of bitcoin up to some monthly limit (like credit cards do) where the micro loans are when you ""spend bitcoin"" from your bitcoin credit account. 

You would probably want the debt to be automatically converted into USD immediately to protect against volatility for now. Then at the end of the month the customer pays off the bill in USD or bitcoin or whatever. 

Why would a customer would use this?
Very low risk entrance into bitcoin purchases. You don't need to actually ""own"" any bitcoin, worry about storage or security, etc. You just spend it through an app (lets say) and pay the bill at the end of the month for whatever you spent. As with normal credit card companies there could probably be a points back system to additionally incentivize use.

Why would such a company make money?
Interest rates, on the USD debt, give revenue just like a normal credit card company. But additionally this does not need to be the same old story. The reason is that this company is effectively converting bitcoin into USD, with a potentially higher return than if it were sold on an exchange because of interest rates. Thus, the company provides a useful service to the customers but also is a profitable means of converting bitcoin into USD or simply a way to invest their bitcoin and receive a return. 

Viewed this way the company does not necessarily need to be an entity unto itself, you could allow people to loan the company bitcoin for a portion of the profits. 

This seems like something that any of the larger players (Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle) are well placed to execute. Would this be something good for bitcoin adoption or am I just crazy?

TL;DR: What do people think of a bitcoin credit app that allows you to spend bitcoin instantly loaned to you (like credit cards)? Could this improve user adoption or is it a dumb idea?",cryptocurrency,1408209539
personalfinance,My late student loan payment was reported as 8 late payments to the credit bureaus. Help!,"So I have federal student loans. I technically have 8 different ones, as each year, I took out a subsidized and unsubsidized loan. However, I just make one payment each month that covers all the loans under one ""umbrella"" through the company that handles the repayment of my federal loans; they treat it like it's one balance and one account (as far as I knew).

So, I messed up and went 60 days late on my payment. I legitimately forgot to pay it. Long story short, the agency handling my loans has been a nightmare, robbed me of over $2000 in withdrawals without my permission (and I was not past due) and left me with no money in a dire time of need, so I have autopay turned off for my student loans because I don't trust them. All my other bills are on autopay, so I forgot.

Excuses aside, I knew my credit would take a hit when I saw I had missed 60 days, but how bad could it really be if I just miss one payment, right? My credit was 710 prior to this. Well... I just checked my credit, and it's 500. WTF?!?!?!

Looking at my derogatory information, it looks like the agency reported EIGHT payments 60 days past due, because they reported every single loan even though I only make one payment......

So now it looks like I have eight SEPARATE accounts 60 days past due. When that is extremely far from the truth.

What the hell can I do? I've already brought my account up to date, but this can't be fair. Is there any course of action? How long will it take to get my credit back up if I'm not able to get these removed somehow? I never have late payments otherwise.

personalfinance,"Lots of Debt, Feeling completely stuck and not sure what to do.","Good afternoon /r/personalfinance,

My story is one of the generic college student who always thought ""I'll never be one of those kids who gets in to too much debt!"" Well, here I am about 5 years later looking at my credit, my debt, and wondering what the heck I need to do.

I keep track of all my spending per paycheck in an Excel document. I was recently living in a nice one bedroom apartment for $325/month with my girlfriend, but with her leaving me, rent is now going up to $650/month and that just took out about all my padding in my budget. 

I have $21,530 in credit card debt over 7 cards, student loans at $20,856 which I've currently got on a graduated repayment plan, and an auto loan at around $19,000 remaining.

My monthly income is about $2,000. Of that, bills amount to roughly:

- Rent: $650
- Electric: $60
- Verizon: $60
- Internet: $70
- Student Loans: $150
- Insurance: $55
- Auto Loan: $350
- Previous Personal Loan: $80 ($700 remaining)
- Other: $20 (Server and Netflix)

That's a total of $1495/mo. The car was purchased somewhat recently and there's almost nothing I can do, this was purchased before the break up. (Yes, retrospectively, I should have just worked on my debt....)

The minimums on the cards are near $500/month, which leaves me with no money for gas, savings, food, etc. I talked with a credit counseling agency and they offered me to do something near $500/mo but that includes at $50 ""service fee"" that can't be waived. I haven't moved on that offer, but they were able to bring interest rates down DRAMATICALLY on all cards. 

I'm totally stuck and don't know what to do. My stomach is sick, and I'm just worried. I just don't know what to do.",finance,1408216644
personalfinance,Advice with consolidating student loans to lower Debt/Income ratio for home loan (USDA loan).,"Ok, so there are many parts to this.  Mainly I would like to know the downsides as you all see it with consolidating my loans.  I have been a redditor for years but made this account to keep my finances more private.
Current situation looks like this:  (Don't cringe, please)

Student Loans: $195,000

Current Income: $65,500 salaried

Soon to earn Income:  $131,000 salaried

Credit Rating : 700

No other loans, no credit card debt.  Currently living in my 24ft camper with a 100lb lab.  Yeah, it sucks.

I have found a place I very much like to buy near the place I am working, exactly in the area I was looking for (rural missouri).  I am looking to take my state boards in roughly 2-3 weeks which after passing and all the paper work is finished will double my salary.

The property in question is listed at $140k but after being on the market for 2+ years, and touring, I feel $127k is a fair offer.  The house itself is not 127k worthy, but it does come with 14 acres of woodlands.  

USDA is income based and with my current income (Max for this county is ~78k), I qualify.  In the text of USDA eligibility it states that income increases in the future are of no concern.  My issue is that my debt to income is currently ~54% based on a 10 year loan payback plan.  All student loans are federal.  I have read that consolidating loans can allow you to increase the payback period to 20-25 years and lower the payments.  This would allow me to get my debt/income ratio down with my current pay and qualify for the USDA loan.  Being that I just graduated and have no down payment saved really, this is extremely enticing. 

I do want to mention, yes I do realize extending loan periods increase interest amounts.  I do not plan to pay at the reduced amount, I just need it to appear so to lower the ratio.  After passing my boards, I will be able to comfortably live with the 10 year payment amounts.

So PF, what do you think the downsides would be on consolidating to qualify for this loan?  Any negatives I have not considered with the USDA loan?  I have a limited time window where I qualify for this loan based on my income.  Its a great problem, but I have no down payment so if I don't do this now, I cant foresee moving out of the camper in the next 4-5 months at best.

It has the potential to affect our democracy for the next 2 years. Please read carefully.**

Dear Reddit,

We've seen a lot of comments on /r/politics lately about the terrible nature of Congress. But I've also noticed a lot of comments expressing a sense of hopelessness regarding Congress--that there's nothing we can do.

That's simply not true.

Yes, districts are gerrymandered, network news spreads misinformation, and some elections seem decided before election day. But upsets can and do happen--especially at the congressional level. All it takes is the right people, the right timing, and people getting mobilized and at least *trying* to do something.

So what follows is a list to all the key Congressional races, with links to the Republican and Democratic candidate campaign websites, as well as any independents and 3rd parties who've polled above 15%. There, you can learn about the candidates and their stances on issues. But, more importantly, you can:

1. Donate money, and,

2. Sign up to volunteer.

Voting is important. But what use is one vote in a district where half the people don't even know an election is going on? Money donated directly to a campaign can help build up a field staff to do outreach to voters, put ads on TV, and can help dramatically shift the direction of a campaign. Volunteering helps enormously, too.

Also, please note: There is a 17 seat deficit right now in the House between Republicans and Democrats, and a 6 seat deficit in the Senate between Democrats and Republicans.

I have listed **17 Senate seats** and **over 80 House districts**--and, this early in the cycle, **all** of them still have potential to flip.

I plan to use this list as a reference to link to anytime somebody on here complains about gerrymandering, slacktivism, or acts as though there is nothing they can do to fix Washington. You are welcome to do the same, too.

For races I'm a bit informed on and know something about the candidates, I am including a bit of information. Yes, I admit to having a progressive/pro-social justice/populist/slightly libertarian bias; get over it.

To be completely fair, I am providing links to Republican candidates' websites too. If you are a conservative, I actually do encourage you to get involved in your candidate's campaign too--you can't shape democracy without all people being involved.

As a side note: if you don't live too close to a swing district, some people may also want to consider remotely volunteering for a campaign via phonebanking. You'd be shocked at how big a difference this can make. Phonebanking for a candidate to do volunteer recruitment in September can double the number of volunteers they get throughout October, which doubles the impact of the campaign.

So, without further ado, may I present **Trying2BaWiseGuy's Complete List of Campaigns To Consider Getting Involved With, Broken down by State and Metro Area:**

**States without key federal general election races at this time IMO:** Alabama, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wyoming...BUT all these states have local elections. Some have key state-wide races, like governorships in South Carolina and Rhode Island. And some of the long-shot races could pull upsets--it happens more easily at the Congressional level, as we saw with Eric Cantor.

So get out there, donate, volunteer, and vote!

(Edit1: Forgot South Dakota! My bad. Had to move some states to the comments as a result.)

(Edit2: There are more potentially competitive races in Wisconsin than I initially thought. Created a comment section for Wisconsin as a result.)

personalfinance,"Paying off student loans, advice?","Hi everyone,

So I'm a recent college graduate and it's time to start paying my loans off. I owe 38k in federal loans and I recently got a job where I'll be making 48k a year. I'm also married and my spouse makes 70k a year. My spouse wants me to dedicate every penny of my salary towards the loans so that I can pay them off within a year. I think this is a good idea and it was my plan, but I wanted to get some input from those of you who know more about student loan debt. 

Here is a spreadsheet screen shot of all the loans and the interest rates: http://i.imgur.com/Lg2XYBn.png

Question: Should I get them all deferred and pay the higher interest loans first to avoid that $521.92 monthly payment? Is there any way to reduce the interests rates even more?",finance,1408233322
personalfinance,What to do next?,"This is just a general summary of myself and what i'm looking to do. I just want some advice to see what to do next. 
22yrs of age with 70k salary.
6k left in student debt @ 3.4% interest rate.
12k car loan at 3% interest.
15k saved up in savings (I put $1000/month into my savings).
0$ CC debt (paid off in full per month).
Already invest company-match in 401k, but not more than company match.
Expenses: $850 of bills per month, the rest goes to gas, food, entertainment, etc. No rent.
750 credit score, no faults in credit.

I'm looking to get into some sort of investing. I could save up for a downpayment to get into some sort of real-estate (currently researching and learning) or I could throw the money into stocks. Also, thinking of opening a frequent flyers credit card since I pay all my bills with my CC I could rack up quite a bit of miles. I need to curb my spending habits because I spend a lot of money on nonsense (Amazon, food, entertainment), but that is easy.

personalfinance,"Question about budgeting, my emergency fund, college loans, and saving for a long-term goal","Hey guys,

I have a couple questions about my future income and where I should be allocating it. I came up with a plan after reading the FAQ and some posts, but I just wanted to make sure it was optimal.

Background:

* I'm 21 years old

* I have $15k in college debt at a ~5% interest rate

* I start a job next month with $60k annual income

* I will be living at home for at least the next year

* I started a Roth IRA for myself with about $2.5k in it so far

* No 401-K matching from my employer

My Current Monthly Plan (Assuming 20% income tax, so $4k a month net) :

* $1,000 to help my parents with the mortgage, health + car insurance, food, etc.

* $460 to my Roth IRA (So I hit $5,500 a year)

* $400 spending money

* ? towards college loans

* ? towards emergency fund

* ? towards other investment / retirement accounts

* ? towards dream vacation fund (I've always wanted to travel around the world and this trip won't happen for at least 5 years or more)

Questions:

1. Am I correct to assume I lose $1k a month to taxes? And is there any way to reduce that?

2. Should I start paying off my college debt? How much a month should I be putting into it?

3. Considering my current low monthly expenses and supportive family, how big should my emergency fund be? What type of assets should my emergency account be in? No interest savings? Bonds?

4. Is $400 a month too much spending money?

5. What type of account should I put my vacation fund in? Considering I won't be taking this trip for 5 years or more should I be putting this into some sort of index fund investment?

6. Is there anything I am missing from my monthly money allocation and how much should I put into each question mark category?

personalfinance,My dad is bad with his money and will be laid off soon...,"Not sure if I should post here on PF or under family...maybe both.  

My parents divorced when I was very young so my dad was always more like a secondary parent in our life.  He's now 57 yrs old.  He's been a steel forger (sp? makes hand tools out of steel) working at the same plant since he was 18 yrs old. He's never promoted because he refused to manage other people and has been content to do the same job all these years.  He's the kind of person who doesn't like change.  He has some Asperger-like personality traits so very difficult to reason with him or change his mind on anything.

He had decided he will retire at 62 yrs old, in 5 years when he's eligible for SS.  His only other retirement source of income is his 401K and only has $80,000 in it.  He has taken out numerous loans over the years to buy crap that depreciates like used cars to fix up.  He has 5 acres of land outside the city and lives next to his crazy brother who also has 5 acres next to him.  He thought about listing the property for sale for a while, but now has it in his head no one will make an offer anyway and has decided to keep the land, although he doesn't maintain it, lets grass grow tall, junk cars sitting around, etc.  He built his own house with help of a few other family members, started it 30 yrs ago and it's only remained about 50% completed.  He ended up taking out a mortgage on the house of $70,000 (don't know how he got a loan for it!) and has $20,000 left to repay.  The house looks horrible. It's almost like a hoarder's scene on the inside.  Trash everywhere and mildew issues.  We (his 3 kids) are concerned about his health as he ages.  He's already gotten a staph infection in his foot. We don't feel it's in good livable condition.  But, we think it's gotten worse because none of us have been inside the house for 7 years.

He's also used credit cards to buy materials for his house over the years. He's paid down balances and then recharged them back up. He recently turned over his $30,000 credit card debt to a debt settlement company called either Peak Advocates or Peak Financial, can't recall the exact name.  I think he heard of them through some random junk mail he received in the mail -- he's kind of guillable :(  I of course told him I thought it was a bad idea and that he should have talked to one of us kids first to help guide him and we may have referred him to credit counseling, not debt settlement and I explained the difference to him and how they affect his credit score.  He didn't seem to care about having a wrecked credit score, nor does he seem that concerned about his financial situation over all.

He's just found out last week that his plant is going to shut down here in Arkansas in about a year, and will move over to SC.  He obviously won't move to SC to keep his job but he also doesn't seem to want to search for a new job.  His new plan seems to be to wait until he's actually laid off and gets his 6 week severance pay from the plant and then try to get unemployment pay from the state.  I'm just really worried and not sure if there is anything we can do except help him out in small ways like make sure he has food to eat, etc.  We decided it's probably best to not give him $ because he would squander it, but just make sure he's fed.  He hangs out at my brother's house all the time (my brother is also single) and watches TV all day on his days off.  He doesn't even spend time in his home, yet he won't sell!

TL;DR:  Dad is bad with $, won't sell his house and land even though he only goes there to sleep.  Only has $80K in 401K acct.  $20K left on a mortgage, $30K credit card debt turned over to debt settlement, has no extra cash left over except just enough for groceries, about to be laid off in a year, is 57 yrs old and his plan to keep working 5 more years is messed up now.  

Anything I can do except help him out in small ways?  He's an adult and I can't exactly tell him what to do with his money even though he manages it poorly.",finance,1408239794

My job pays for my medical insurance, and because I work for the govt, I get to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, in which, after 120 consecutive loan payments under the income-based repayment (IBR) plan (it would take 10 years), the balance of my student loans will be discharged, tax free (for now anyway).  With IBR, my monthly payment is about $330 total, and will increase a bit each year if I get a raise.

My job has what I think is a decent retirement plan.  They take 7% of my annual salary, and match it 200%, and it grows annually at 7% (set by the state legislature).  Vesting is at year 8.  I am about 1.5 years in and **have no other retirement/investment accounts**.

However, I do feel its time to leave my parents house, and am tired to the twice-daily 40 minute commute to work, and desire to move closer to work.

If I stick to my savings routine, I will have $25k or more by December (currently sitting at $18k).

FYI, I have an 8-year old Honda, paid off, 130k miles on her, but I think and hope I can keep her going for at least another 2 years or more.  Any suggestions on what to do with my savings, other than just sitting there, would be great.

personalfinance,"I was mailed a check for a sizable amount of money, I have no idea what it is for. What should I do?","The check itself is entirely computer printed, it is sent from a law firm in another state that I have no knowledgeable affiliation to, through a national bank.  The check has perforation on the bottom as if it was torn off of something else.  It has my name and address printed on it, and is signed in the bottom right corner.  The check has all the usual security features present on the back and appears to be real.  

However, the check itself was contained in a plain white envelope with nothing but my name handwritten on the front.  This was shipped in a standard Fedex 9.5""x12.5"" envelope labeled priority overnight. The shipping address of the fedex envelope is from a different state (Georgia, as opposed to the law firm in Arkansas).  The address of this location appears to be a large warehouse from google maps.  

I was not expecting a check from anyone, especially not for such a sizable amount of money.  Could it be a settlement I'm unaware of?  Who should I talk to about whether or not it is real and what is the purpose of it?

Thanks for your help!  ~confused~

EDIT:  You all have great advice here.  To assuage your fears I would faster cast this check into the fires than cash it! I don't need the money, and I'm an eternal skeptic about these sorts of things (I've had a few family members robbed by scummy stuff).  I'll update everyone as soon as I get to my local bank branch first thing Monday morning, thanks so much for your sound advice!

EDIT #2:  I want to credit u/ursa__major for identifying this as a fraud, here is what he said to me so hopefully it will get some visibility here at the top of the thread:

&gt; Okay, so I'm looking at the check and here's what I'm noticing: - the font on the check is plain; typical for counterfeit checks - the dollar amount has ""**"" before the written amount.. this almost ALWAYS is present on counterfeit checks and rarely on legitimate checks. - the dollar amount itself.. $1970.00. Typically fraudulent checks are for slightly below $2000.00. ""Fraudsters"" believe that banks have some sort of $2k threshold that alerts them to take an extra look at checks, so they're almost always around $1900.00
Those indicators alone would be enough for me to deny payment of a check, but just to be sure I checked on the routing number on the MICR line of the check... 082001247 routes back to ""Simmons First National Bank"".... yet the check has ""Metropolitan National Bank"" listed as the payee bank. So, in lieu of that, I'm 100% positive that this is a counterfeit check and someone is trying to scam you.

Thank you u/ursa__major so much for your advice.  I intend to show the scam to my local bank branch so they are aware of its existence (although it sounds like this happens to thousands of people every day) and then I will have them shred it for me right there.  All of your advice has been tremendous here and I wish you all the best.  Keep an eye out for these scams and always be cautious of unexpected windfalls.  Cheers everyone!",finance,1408241821
Bitcoin,Precautions to avoid bank/federal alerts when selling and buying big $$$ through Coinbase,"I have been a Coinbase customer for months now and so far have had nothing but success with my bitcoin experience.  I primarily use bitcoin to gamble through various bitcoin websites (nitrogenpoker, etc).

-bank account to btc through coinbase purchase
-gamble
-win (usually)
-transfer to coinbase account
-sell BTC through coinbase and USD lands in my bank account

My concern is that my winnings are becoming substantial, to the point that I'm a bit worried about the act of simply cashing out roughly $10k worth of BTC in one big sell.  I am not doing anything illegal, but I dont want to raise any flags or lead my bank to flag my account.  I would also like to hear how people pay taxes on income like this.  

I know this is a bit vague, but I basically just want to hear how you guys handle transfers of large amounts of btc and convert to USD without any hiccups.

Bitcoin,How to make Bitcoin more fair,"**Bitcoin is far from perfect. These sorts of debates should happen and need to happen.**

The problem with Bitcoin is that it’s a pyramid scheme. The amount of Bitcoin you own depends arbitrarily on when you first heard of it and purchased it. It’s about informational advantage. If everyone in the world converted all their money to Bitcoin, the entire distribution of wealth in the world would depend entirely on who bought Bitcoins first. There is no logical reason for non-Bitcoiners to agree to those terms.

The purported philosophical benefit of Bitcoin over fiat is that governments can’t control the rate of emission arbitrarily as a means of controlling inflation/deflation.

The finer details would take experts more skilled than myself, but I have a proposal.

What if a government offered to issue coins on a 1:1 basis for fiat currency. You would go to official government offices that were set up where you would “burn” your fiat for coins the same way that proof of burn works. The total money supply of this new currency would grow as more people exchanged their currency for this new coin. The difference is that the value of this new coin would be directly tied to the fiat currency. This way it wouldn’t benefit early adopters unfairly.

The benefits of switching to this new system would be all the purported benefits that Bitcoin has now – self banking, quick transfers, and freedom of exchange. Also the ledger would be distributed so that everyone could fairly asses that the money supply wasn’t being tampered with. All without the unfairness of a pyramid scheme distribution method.

Thoughts?

Edit:

I'm suggesting there would be no ""fed"" controlling issuance. No more money could be printed after this coin was created except for what exists today. The only new coins minted would be to replace lost currency.

Edit 2:

Look at it from the general public's eyes. In the Bitcoin system, the rich will be poor now because they signed up for Bitcoin late. Think they will agree to that? Think again.

Edit 3:

Just to be absolutely clear, I'm a fan of the technology behind Bitcoin. But it's distribution is flawed.

Try to see past your own desire to get rich, your own bias, and consider this idea for a moment.

Edit 4:

Overall, pretty disappointed with the close minded-ness here. I got a bunch of downvotes because people disagreed with me. I pretty much expected that though. Just so you know, in altcoin circles r/bitcoin is notorious for close minded people who downvote anything that questions Bitcoin. I think a couple of you considered my ideas and criticisms of Bitcoin so it was worth it.",cryptocurrency,1408256790

Here is my current situation: I am 19 years old, and about to enter my sophomore year of college, while majoring in Psychology (Though I'm not sure if I'm going to stay with this major). I am living at home with my parents and will likely continue to live with them throughout my college experience and maybe even after. I already had to take out a subsidized loan of $3500 for my first year in college.  

At the moment I do not have a job and I am still searching one. I'm hoping to get a job on campus. I'm very dependent on my parents income. It looks like I may have to take out another loan but I'm not entirely sure because I still have financial aid pending. I'm trying to avoid doing into a large debt. 

I am still waiting for the last of my financial aid to be disbursed, and currently it says I still owe $1260.91 in my account. My only option is taking out a subsidized loan for $4500. (I have two others but I don't want to take out those loan because one is a unsubsidized loan and another is some fed parent loan. I believe that one is also unsubsidized.)

Questions: 
~~1. What are some things I can be doing now to make it easier to pay off the student loans later?~~ Answered

2. Once/if I get a job, should I try paying off the loan I have no or should I just save up my money for the following year? It seems that I am always short about $1000-$2000 (This is if my tuition is the same and if I receive the same amount of financial aid)

3. What will happen once I graduate college and have to start paying for loans? Will I get a bill in the mail? What important information would I need to know about the loans. (I don't know the interest rate and can't find where it would say it). 

4. Once I start paying for loans, how do I set how much I pay each month? Do I talk to my financial aid office about that? 

5. Is there any other way to avoid taking out more loans? (Besides getting a job)

~~Final Questions: What else can I do right now to obtain financial security in the future? (ex. get a credit and build credit or something similar to that) Is there something else I should focus on in regards to finance?~~

Yes, they will go after your estate after you die, but if you didn't own your house or car, what it next? If you weren't legally married to your longtime boyfriend/girlfriend, but they had $100,000 in items, is that traceable?

personalfinance,Is employer-funded health insurance taxable?,"I work for the government and receive free health insurance as a benefit. For the past two years my husband has been on my plan. (We are a heterosexual couple which, based on my research, makes a difference.)

Since both of us receive free insurance as a benefit - we don't contribute a dime - is my husband's free insurance viewed as ""income"" and subject to federal taxes? (As an aside we file separately to take advantage of the income-based student loan program; keeps my payments low and they will be forgiven in another 7 or 8 years.)

Bitcoin,"Pump &amp; Dump is ""no longer"" an acceptable term in crypto currency","Greetings Yung Astronauts!
 
I would like to start by saying, ""There is no such thing as a bad child"". I believe that children learn what they live and are products of their everyday surroundings whether it be poverty or prosperity. With that said, ""There is a such thing as a bad child in crypto currency"". A ""wild child"" who is rapidly creating new coins, mining at the speed of light and then reaping rewards through fraudulent methods of exchange trading. This means of trading is called a ""Pump &amp; Dump Scheme"" and is a criminal offense on Wall Street that comes with fines, forfeiture, incarceration, parole and restitution. I know your yung minds are saying, ""It's unregulated, we can do whatever we want!"" But the reality is if crypto currency were regulated you would be considered a criminal. Understanding crypto is one thing, understanding securities law &amp; regulation is another.
 
My point is obvious to a seasoned investor, but would be inconceivable to a yung crypto investor. NYS will be the first to basically take control of Bitcoin in the form of a license and adopted rules which I believe to be a hoax. They haven't a clue on what they are doing from the public eye and are cooperating wanting Bitcoin to work. I believe this to be true, but I also believe it to be a slight of hand on their behalf. Why? NYS regulation has nothing to do with CFTC, Federal, FINRA, or SEC regulation in the US. Ex: Medical Marijuana is legal in some US states, but not federally legalized in ""any"" US states, same premise will apply to Bitcoin. So now we have COIN? The brainchild of the Winklevoss stooges, a joke when they got robbed of Facebook and a still a joke today in my book. Money doesn't come with brains, these guys pay ""so-called"" trusted advisors, for me to take these guys serious would be a cardinal sin. They are giving Bitcoin away to it's natural born enemy, ""the state"" and selling it out commercially for their own personal financial agenda and objectives. Much like MC Hammer or Vanilla Ice were accused of. Hey, ""Let's give this kitten to the pitbull's."" I wonder what Satoshi Nakamoto is thinking? Remember Bitcoin was created for equality, not for the rich to get richer, while gaining MORE control. Why even support BTC? It will become another version of USD if we are not careful.
 
However, COIN which is an ETF created by the Winklevoss twins is a Bitcoin oriented Exchange Traded Fund based on the WinDex market price of Bitcoin which is Winklevoss created. I believe in the concept completely, but I believe COIN should have been launched on Coinbase as their ""second"" investment product which would have helped in the ""self regulation"" of Bitcoin, not the ""joint regulation"". Coinbase has enough capital and support to do this and the Winklevoss twins are in bed with them. Their sole reason for listing on NASDAQ is to gain mainstream ""investor"" exposure and trap real whales or bag holders they so ""urgently seek"" to profit tangibily on Bitcoin. The twins cannot possibly sell off their BTC, it would kill it! They need to ""cross out"" of their position at equal pricing (both buyer/seller) to keep the price stabilized the old fashioned way, the Wall Street way. They need new blood, new money. The 2 stooges own a total of 1% of all Bitcoin's mined, so new capital will allow them to ""gently liquidate"" their valuable holdings and convert them to USD. They do not believe in Bitcoin, they believe in capitalism and this is their EXIT strategy. By their doing, Bitcoin will now be sanctioned by a whole ""new"" set of rules outside of NYS. These rules will be enforced by FINRA and the SEC if the COIN ETF gets a NASDAQ listing, it is mandatory or the Winklevoss ETF cannot list and that is a fact. My reasoning, You cannot get half pregnant!
 
Without boring you with all of the stock market rules and regulations, upon COIN's listing I would have to believe any NYS/US Bitcoin related exchange and/or investment vehicle will eventually fall under strict FINRA/SEC federal regulation. NYS regulation will act somewhat like the Investment Advisory Act Of 1940 to govern states individually. FINRA/SEC regulation will cover the markets in general like other investments. We might see CFTC regulation enforced if ever Bitcoin is reclassified as a commodity. So it is important to understand they are going to enforce similar regulation to Bitcoin as they did FOREX, gold, and other precious metals in which the physical side is still the wild west. They want to enforce the sale of Bitcoin, so they can weed out some who have made bad decisions in the past which is about 50% of adult crypto. Restricting people who have a criminal past or securities related charges is a standard position taking on Wall Street for investor protection purposes. While they appear to be protecting the public, their white shoe friends will take over Bitcoin and sell it through all the major wire houses generating commission checks and capital gain tax for everybody!!! I see Bitcoin's future, I really do. It's gonna work well, but we will lose our foot hold as a community, It will just become another form of Paypal.
 
So my rant on regulation is simple. When the IRS classified Bitcoin as an asset everything was ""retroactive"". Let's say they impose federal regulation and do the same thing? We are looking at many crimes committed in crypto currency and many people going to crypto prison. My main objective of this post is to educate our youth on the future laws to come. Pump &amp; Dump is ""no longer"" an acceptable term in crypto currency, it cheapens this technological innovation that will change our financial landscape as we know it yesterday. When an investment trades higher in value on Wall Street it's called a ""price increase"", ""surge in value"" or something of that nature. Please understand Yung Astronauts you were taught wrong, choose your words wisely. Become the good children of crypto currency and make more money developing the alt coin side of Bitcoin, it is ""our"" only hope for a future with anonymity.

Bitcoin,Some facts about the blockchain.,"1) The Blockchain is among the oldest industries on the planet, going back more than 10,000 years to the beginnings of pottery. The Columbia History of the World states that the oldest relic of human industry is a bit of The Blockchain fabric dating back to approximately 8,000 BC.
 
2) Presidents Washington and Jefferson both grew The Blockchain. Americans were legally bound to grow The Blockchain during the Colonial Era and Early Republic. The federal government subsidized The Blockchain during the Second World War and US farmers grew about a million acres of The Blockchain as part of that program.
 
3) The Blockchain Seed is far more nutritious than even soybean, contains more essential fatty acids than any other source, is second only to soybeans in complete protein (but is more digestible by humans), is high in B-vitamins, and is 35% dietary fiber. The Blockchain seed is not psychoactive and cannot be used as a drug. See TestPledge.com
 
4) The bark of the The Blockchain stalk contains bast fibers which are among the Earth's longest natural soft fibers and are also rich in cellulose; the cellulose and hemi-cellulose in its inner woody core are called hurds. The Blockchain stalk is not psychoactive. The Blockchain fiber is longer, stronger, more absorbent and more insulative than cotton fiber.
 
5) According to the Department of Energy, The Blockchain as a biomass fuel producer requires the least specialized growing and processing procedures of all The Blockchain products. The hydrocarbons in The Blockchain can be processed into a wide range of biomass energy sources, from fuel pellets to liquid fuels and gas. Development of biofuels could significantly reduce our consumption of fossil fuels and nuclear power.
 
6) The Blockchain grows well without herbicides, fungicides, or pesticides. Almost half of the agricultural chemicals used on US crops are applied to cotton.
 
7) The Blockchain produces more pulp per acre than timber on a sustainable basis, and can be used for every quality of paper. The Blockchain paper manufacturing can reduce wastewater contamination. The Blockchain's low lignin content reduces the need for acids used in pulping, and it's creamy color lends itself to environmentally friendly bleaching instead of harsh chlorine compounds. Less bleaching results in less dioxin and fewer chemical byproducts.
 
8) The Blockchain fiber paper resists decomposition, and does not yellow with age when an acid-free process is used. The Blockchain paper more than 1,500 years old has been found. It can also be recycled more times.
 
9) The Blockchain fiberboard produced by Washington State University was found to be twice as strong as wood-based fiberboard.
 
10) Eco-friendly The Blockchain can replace most toxic petrochemical products. Research is being done to use The Blockchain in manufacturing biodegradable plastic products: plant-based cellophane, recycled plastic mixed with The Blockchain for injection-molded products, and resins made from the oil, to name just a very few examples.",cryptocurrency,1408325350

personalfinance,Upping 401k vs. paying down a 9% student loan,"My wife and I have reached a point where we are trying to pay down on our mountain of student loan debt as part of our goal to be financially independent by the age of 45.

We have approximately $10k of debt on a 9% note and $15k of debt on a 7% note. Now, initially my thought was to pay down the 9% note since it's essentially a risk-free investment with a 9% return. I've seen a few personal finance blogs say the same thing. 

Now my question is, since a 401k is tax-deferred, and since I live in a state with a very high marginal tax rate (9%), am I better off just saving my extra money in a 401k? When I combine federal and state marginal tax rates, we are currently being taxed 28% + 8.98% = 36.98%. However, in today's dollars at today's tax brackets, we plan to retire in a marginal tax bracket of 15% + 6.8% = 21.8%. Essentially, the plan is that for every dollar we put into a pre-tax retirement account instead of using it as income today, we will save 15 cents right off the bat. That doesn't even take into account the 7% growth assumption!

Now I know an actuary should probably know this, but is there anything I'm missing? By my comparative income tax rates, my calculations are showing that unless I'm paying on a note that is north of a 22% interest rate, I should just put that money into my 401k instead.",finance,1408329322

financialindependence,financial adviser meeting,"Hi Everyone,

I posted a question 2 weeks ago and you were all very helpful, so I'm coming to you again.  I'm meeting a financial adviser tomorrow at lunch.  I already have a financial adviser that i went to because my mother had been using her for a year or two, and i didn't have much financial awareness back then.  I've since lost all respect for her and do not care to see her anymore except to check in on money I've already invested with her investing firm of choice.  i already paid the 'buy in' fee to make those investments, so now i feel like i might as well make her work for it, but i won't be investing anymore with her.  

so i called a few places to look for a financial adviser who doesn't sell any products themselves.  i think those may be very difficult to find or i am doing my searches wrong.  i found the guy i'm seeing tomorrow but i think he was just better at telling me what i wanted to here to try to set the appointment.  what i really want is someone who is very experienced in working with people who retire very early (i'm shooting for 40) and knows how a typical early retiree needs to plan for their life after retirement.  i'd rather pay this person a flat fee for the advice and keep it separate from anyone selling me a financial investment.  does anyone do this kind of service who anyone can recommend?  and if so, how much does this kind of service cost?  Or should i just go on with my own self-education and not worry about professional advice?  I really just want to make sure i'm not missing anything in the planning for early retirement that might make me come up short on the calculations.

technology,Comcast’s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,"*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “Unreturned” equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast’s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast’s fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible &amp; overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, &amp; International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  

But believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls.",technology,1408338226

What can I do from here?","My employer has informed me that my wages will be garnished beginning with my next paycheck due to my student loans defaulting and passing on to a collection agency (West Asset Management). According to my employer, a law was passed in 1996 that permits federal agencies to garnish wages without a court order.

I don't know what my options are to do from here. Everything I read here about collection agencies is ""don't talk to collection agencies"", but the garnishment amount is more than I am comfortable paying each paycheck.

I have done a little research and from what I have read I can halt the garnishment by submitting for a hearing to challenge the garnishment, but I need to do that within 30 days of receiving the Notice of Intent to Garnish. Unfortunately I have not received any sort of written information about this, so I'm not sure if that went to my employer or to me.

One thing that does seem a little off to me is the amount that I am being garnished. I know that my tax return this year was withheld by the IRS due to my student loan and it went towards that. I feel like the amount owed is lower than what I am being garnished for, but I will have to see if I have any of that paperwork somewhere at home.",finance,1408362413
personalfinance,"Arranged flatshare with friend at uni while I was on exchange. While I was away, he paid the deposit (£1550), then he failed uni and the flat was remarketed. Now he wants me to pay him half of the deposit. What can I do?","Hopefully this is the right board to ask this question in. It's a bit more complicated than the title so I'll explain in more detail. 

I've recently returned from a year abroad as part of my uni's exchange program. While I was away, I arranged to share a flat for the next academic year (Sept 2014 - May 2015) with a friend of mine at uni, who would be going into his final year at the same time as me. 

Since I was on the other side of the world, it was he who found the flat, viewed it, and paid the deposit.

However, shortly before I returned, he informed me that he would not be able to progress into the next year of uni, and as a result would not be able to live in the flat. He made a few attempts to find a replacement flatmate for himself, resulting in a friend of ours at university agreeing to take his place. 

The new flatmate completed the forms, but eventually his tenancy application was denied because he failed a mandatory credit check (as he himself is not a student and has a bad credit score). 

A few days later, the letting agency re-marketed the flat (not without warning), taking the entire £1550 deposit. The guy I was initially going to live with has now told me that he wants me to pay him my half of the deposit, which would be £775. I did not sign any documents, although my dad completed a guarantor form for the letting agency on my behalf, and I don't believe this is fair. Because of this situation I now need to pay for an additional deposit, which I won't be able to afford if I have to pay my friend this money. 



So now my questions are:

1) Is there any chance of me being able to secure at least a partial deposit refund for my friend? Edinburgh letting agencies are particularly arsey about taking students' deposits, but I feel that maybe if I can say the right things to them on the phone, they may give my friend some of his money back. EPM letting agency (Edinburgh) holds deposits in the SafeDeposits Scotland custodial scheme.

2) I went to the Citizens' Advice Bureau this morning and explained the situation from my point of view. They told me that since I didn't sign anything, my ""debt"" to him is not enforceable, and there is no legal action he can take other than take me to a small claims court, which will likely be my word against his. Is there anything else I need to do to protect myself?

technology,Regarding our unified hatred of Comcast,"I'm sorry about this long post, but I've had enough, Reddit. If even 1 person sees this and does something to help, it will have been worth my time.

I live in Chicago and have Comcast as my ISP. I hate them just as much as anyone in this community. However, I think we all have shifted our attention to the wrong culprit in all of this. The recent posts regarding $1000+ wrongful charges, job loss, and countless other disappointing support stories are fantastic examples of a conglomerate taking advantage of it's place in the market, and its customers. But sharing and discussing these stories isn't doing anything. At all. Look at the results. It's getting WORSE. We need to change the way we think.

Comcast, while guilty of some truly despicable things on a very regular basis, is not the root of what we are experiencing in this country. The real problem is the lack of competition and regulations set on service providers as a whole in this country. It's no coincidence that Comcast is typically the only option for cable or even high-speed internet in a given area, while also having the worst customer service. The don't have to care. And they won't as long as they don't have to. NO AMOUNT OF COMCAST SHAMING IS GOING TO CHANGE OUR SITUATION, NOR WILL IT CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS US. IT WON'T CHANGE THEIR VIEWS ON THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEIR PROFITS, OR THEIR STRANGLEHOLD ON THIS COUNTRY. 

They. Don't. Care.

And it's because they don't have to. We are going after the wrong entity here. Comcast isn't the root. There are other Comcasts in the United States (and the world). They aren't the only ISP with horrible service, high prices, and vindictive attitudes towards the people lining their bottomless pockets. The real problem is the lack of regulation, the allowance on monopolization of markets, and most importantly, the lack of decent competition. Even if people hated Comcast enough to switch providers, who are they going to switch to? In most places, there is no other high-speed option. We have been backed into a corner. We are being told to like what we are given. The rest of the world knows that Americans don't put up with that, because we're like that, and here we are taking it in the ass and we are doing nothing about it but calling names.

Stop trying to plea to Comcast. I beg of you (irony!). They won't listen. We need to concentrate our efforts on changing the laws in this country to MAKE them change. We need competitors in the market. Then, and ONLY then, will you get better service, better prices, and a better internet experience. Hell, if we push to make them a public utility, the game changes for the better instantly, providing standard pricing and service regulations.

We can't wait around for Google Fiber. That's not the answer. The answer is to even the playing ground for us, the consumers, and that's the job of the federal government. They are the ones to shame. They are the ones to go after. Fuck Comcast and their bullshit. Go around them.

litecoin,"""Unknown"" may be far fewer miners than I originally thought...","As regulars to the sub probably know, I have been watching the behavior of the solo miners, represented as ""unknown"" hashrate on https://www.litecoinpool.org/pools - at one point, they accounted for 33% of the network hashrate (and block rewards). Now they're around 29% or so.

I decided to check up on their behavior today, it's been about 20 days since I last looked into it. I noticed that a couple of the mining addresses had stopped receiving block rewards entirely, over the past couple of weeks. Those that remained were still selling...however, in digging through the destination addresses I found something REALLY interesting (at least, to me).

I started by following the movement of Litecoin out of Lbg64inpH9cEj7Vihb6T4k9B2uDsUWMJS2 - which appeared to be one of the smaller miners in the ""top 30%"" I had been keeping tabs on. Every withdrawal from this address went to LbowG2peDQgSi5MSPJ7qkD7h9LpRVJxsa9. So I went down the list to find out where Litecoin was moving from there. There was one common address that kept coming up: LMU67WeU7Mjm7DzhVdcnej2wRqfNEU6fou.

https://chain.so/address/LTC/LMU67WeU7Mjm7DzhVdcnej2wRqfNEU6fou

When checking out that address, I discovered that it is receiving deposits with inputs from several of the largest solo addresses I've been tracking via the hashrate distribution charts at litecoinpool.org. This would seem to indicate that all of these addresses are in the same exact wallet, which means that a lot of that ""unknown"" hashrate isn't multiple large miners at all...it's one VERY big miner sending block rewards to different addresses in the same wallet. Check out the last transaction, on August 14th:

https://chain.so/tx/LTC/33b94d1fd32e1753ed81e5b91ebb1b0f098017881783534973b19ffe95b813d9

Below are the addresses that are involved in the deposit, all of which can be seen receiving block rewards at https://www.litecoinpool.org/pools

**LTJwGJeob3TgiAbg7JGqj1MLYmerJRgtLS**

This address started 5/26 and has received 272,794 LTC.

**LeqxgQ1TZtG2KzfxGB47FUAeJjk2QMDRjo**

This one started on 5/22 and has received 161,901 LTC to date.

**LU73Wci2NVmAPHjvt1Qms74aMb3MnpLTkC**

This one started on 6/26 and has received 89,045 LTC to date.

**LbowG2peDQgSi5MSPJ7qkD7h9LpRVJxsa9**

This one started 7/9 and has received 11,775 LTC to date.

There are a couple of other addresses involved in the transaction that don't appear to be receiving mining rewards, but are receiving a steady stream of LTC in a relatively regular pattern of deposit amounts.

**LVR9rdeCmJ1FfLzhXS7coYihyyqoQJhZuf**

This one started on 5/14 and keeps receiving a steady stream of deposits around 10 LTC each. Total received is 13,747...zero balance being maintained.

**LbMvaVTqkh4cbp1uVg6BRkmncATW8z1DVM**

This one started on 4/23 and has been receiving a mix of amounts between 10-20 LTC, steadily. Total received is 59,541 and a current balance of just 161 LTC.

So it looks like a healthy portion of the selling pressure isn't necessarily due to any kind of competitive or ""cartel"" mindset among 10-12 large miners, but is in large part coming from ONE of them. They are likely the sole party responsible for introducing over half a million new Litecoin onto the exchanges since late May, judging by the information I can glean from the block explorers.

Pretty interesting and raises a lot of questions. But it also gives me hope, that his footprint on the network may be about to be dwarfed by all of the incoming hashrate of the new devices, this fall. I truly believe that is when we'll start to see a healthier network and the selling pressure can be alleviated somewhat. Time will tell.",cryptocurrency,1408392411
personalfinance,Damage control: My grandparents just cosigned a cousin's college loan.,"OK so I'm working through this and need any outside help I can get.

**Backstory, skip to next bold to get to just the PF component**


My grandparents live a happy retired life. Both worked their whole lives, saved responsibly, and have pensions. They are in their mid 80's and own a house in the North East and snowbird to another house they own in Florida. Both are single level, 1-2 bedroom houses on small lots. Far from extravagant. They have previously offered about a thousand dollars at a time to my siblings and I for college, and take repayment reluctantly (""We can't take it with us, you know""). My grandfather works 5 days a week, 6 hours a day, during the summers at a tourist spot. 

I'm going to guess they have 5 figures in the bank and enough income from the pensions and part time work to fully cover their day to day costs. They have handled medical expenses (broken ankle, cataracts, etc) without help. 

Enter my cousin and her mother, my aunt. They moved near my grandparents to mooch about a decade ago, and got another family member pay for their trailer. No college education for the mother, 10+ years working at a retailer. The mother has unpaid medical debt, admittedly makes minimum payments on her credit card debt, and has no assets to speak of. 

The cousin is above average in school, about 25/300 in her graduating class. Suffers from big fish, little pond syndrome something fierce. Decided to go to college in the South as part of her plan to become the next Taylor Swift, taking a premed track with a minor in music at a liberal arts college. Estimators are spitting out ~35k/year in tuition plus boarding and fees. Only managed to get ~10k in scholarships, which might actually be a one time payout. 

And I just found out my Nana cosigned a 20k loan with my Aunt. 

So obviously this is terrible. I'm working through finding out if my cousin even did her FAFSA, because the child of a single, uneducated, low income mother trying to get into a field where women are underrepresented should be drowning in Federal aid. Next comes convincing my grandparents to keep their name off anything else.

**Financial component** 

What can my family and I do to minimize the damage of my Aunt inevitably not paying off this loan? Can we buy my grandparents' house from them to protect it from collections, or is that included in their cosign/illegal? Is there a way to make sure my Nana can see the amount that is accruing on the debt as it's happening? I have no doubt my Aunt will try to keep that bit of information secret until it's too late. Is there anything else that can be done to insulate my grandparents from this before the poo hits the fan?

personalfinance,Convoluted Homebuying Situation. Trying to clear it all up.,"Hi everyone, I have some questions about the current predicament I'm in with buying my first home.  My fiance and I are looking to escape our current renting situation and buy our first home.  We have a home that we like that we're seeing soon, but even if it's not this house, it will be another one of comparable price.

Here are the basics:

Currently we have about 35k to put toward a down payment(mine almost entirely). After the down payment I would have 7k in liquid cash left. We save about 2k a month combined, but we can save up to 3k if we really dig in our heels and eat bologna and cheese every night!  We pay 900 in rent each month. We have found a house that, with mortgage , property taxes, and insurance, would be roughly 1000 a month.

Here's where things get dicey: I have the money and she has the credit.  Her score is in the mid 700s.  But she's also got 25k of student loan debt and next to no savings (1-2k).  I have the 35k for the down payment and would have about 8k leftover for savings and expenses.

When talking to the bank, they told her that she is prequalified for a 140k mortgage with a 4.1% interest rate over 30 years.  They said I could be on the title and own 50% of the house, but she would be the only one on the loan.  Not only that, but I could also provide the down payment through a joint account or somesuch.

Is this a normal situation?  What are the chances of us getting screwed?  Or just ME getting screwed since I'm throwing 35k at the house that she has the loan for?",finance,1408394989

personalfinance,I spend $2k per month. I earn 3.2% cash back. Can I get better?,"I spent $2k per month, all on my cash back credit card. I am fairly consistent in my categories of spend. Approx. $500 per month in gas. Approx $1,000 per month at the grocery store. And $500 on everything else (combination of restaurants, entertainment, travel, etc. depending upon the month).

My current line-up: PenFed Cash Rewards for gas (5%). Amex Blue Cash Preferred for groceries (6% on first $3k, 1% thereafter = 3.5% pre-free). And Fidelity Amex for everything else (2%).

I am not interested in bonus offers (and churning). I am OK with up to 3 cards. And I just want to earn the highest rate.

I have only found 2 websites where I can input my spend and see how much I earn - NerdWallet and MagnifyMoney. All other sites seem to just have lists (and the lists start to look very familiar).

On Nerdwallet (http://www.nerdwallet.com/cash-rewards-credit-cards) I selected 1 year, excellent credit and annual fee up to $500. For gas, it said Chase Freedom. $280 cash back, of which $100 is a sign-on bonus. For groceries, it suggested Union Bank Graphite American Express. $340 of cash back, of which $100 is a bonus offer. For everything else, it suggested Capital One Quicksilver, $190 cash back, of which $100 is bonus. So, excluding the sign-on, it would be $510 of cash back, or 2.1%.

At MagnifyMoney (http://magnifymoney.com/compare/cashback-rewards), you can select ""ongoing rewards"" to see the earn rate after the bonus offer. I was offered PenFed Cash rewards for gas ($300 cash back). Blue Cash Preferred from Amex ($345 on-going) and Fidelity for everything else ($120). So, that is (excluding sign-on bonuses) $765 per year of cash back. And it is what I have today (3.2%).

So I have 2 questions:
1. Are there any better sites out there that has more cards (where I can input my information and see the results)?
2. Are there any other cards I should consider, given how much I spend (and the way I spend)?

technology,The real issue with Comcast and other ISPs in the US,"There has been a lot of posts about Comcast and how horrible their products and services are, in particular about reliability and customer support.  But I haven't seen many people discussing what the real issue with Comcast and other ISPs in the United States is...

Internet access is not treated as a utility!

In most places in the US, Internet access is just a service, not a product, and definitely not a utility.  ISP -- the S in that is Service -- service provider.  Imagine if your power company were unregulated as a service provider.  Outages weekly, not getting the amount of voltage or current you paid for each month.  It would never be accepted, yet that is exactly the situation in most places in the US for Internet service.

Why? Because citizens have not stood up and demanded that data services be treated as a utility.  Even most wireless services are exempt from utility regulation, despite the fact that more people use wireless than wired phones.  The argument is always that data services are not a utility or regulated because they are not necessary like power, sewer, and water.  But that isn't true in today's society.  Internet access is no longer a luxury. It is a requirement for commerce and lack of access to it hurts communities and business.

In my town the local power is a monopoly, as is the trash service, and natural gas.  Is the product sold unreliable? Is the service bad?  Usually not, but if there is a problem I can go to the utility commission to escalate things and get it fixed.  Every few years the contract for some of these services is renegotiated.   We just got a new trash company because the old one was so horrible and had years or problems.  I also think the rates went down because there was so much competition to get the contract with the city!

Comcast is a little bit different in that I believe that Comcast has to pay a fee to use the utility poles in town and has an exclusive agreement with the city to provide ""Cable television services"".  However, they seem to own all the lines and infrastructure.  So while it seems like the City could take away their exclusive agreement, I'm not sure what company would want to pay to install an entire city of infrastructure or that Comcast would sell their existing infrastructure at that point.  Knowing Comcast they might threaten to pull everything out (including the wires on the poles) just to prevent competition.  But I don't know, maybe that is even too expensive a cost for them.

Anyway... my point is that if society really feels like Internet access is now a necessary utility for it to function (which I'd say most would argue it is) then it needs to be regulated as a utility.  Arguing over whether Comcast is too big, or should be allowed to be the only provider is side-stepping the real issue.  Data services need to be a utility and managed by local, State, and possibly Federal regulations.  I know some people believe that government is a big fail and that any new regulation is a horrible idea, but I just don't see how you can make that argument given the experiences we are having and the successes in power, gas, and water regulation.

Also, I'd like to point out that here in Portland, Oregon, when AT&amp;T bought the local cable service from TCI, the City required that the broadband infrastructure must be shared with competitors so that other companies could offer competing high speed services.  The City had the foresight to see that if only one broadband provider existed it would be a problem. The City was sued and the city WON, initially.  They then lost on Federal appeal.  

DSL has competition because of a law that requires the local [telephone] exchange company (LEC) make available their termination infrastructure for a reasonable fee to competitors. This was the law that the City of Portland tried to fight AT&amp;T with (I think) but lost in Federal appeals court, as the law was said to only cover telecommunications not cable television.  This law should be expanded to cover all data providers including wireless and cable given that most telecommunications is only data today.  It isn't a perfect solution (and I'm sure lots of people will chime in with the problems with this setup over the decade) but it actually created some competition, especially in the first years, for DSL.  I think you can get DSL from 5 - 6 companies in Portland, and telephone service from at least 3.  We have multiple wireless data options including private small companies that do point to point.  We only have one cable provider.",technology,1408402425

I would also like to mention that I'm in the process of building an emergency fund by contributing $1000/mo 

- Should I contribute less to my 401(k)? The company matches on the first 8% (the expense ratios are low enough that I can just keep all of my money in the 401(k) w/o worrying about an IRA). I do not want to go lower than 10% which would be $450 a month and really only frees up $175/mo

- Should I scale back my emergency fund contributions? It would take me longer to save up to my target amount which means I can't put that money towards other savings sooner.

Are there any suggestions or thoughts about this situation? Overall I'm doing very well, and it wouldn't kill me to scale back some savings but I'm just looking for a little guidance.",finance,1408411739
personalfinance,I need 16k dollars to attend a certain school... Continued inside. Financial advice is needed please.,"Okay, so I want to attend the Divers Institute of Technology in Seattle, but I was told I will need to supplement my financial aid with a private loan option, since it is a 7 month school.

The total direct cost of attending the school is $28,080.00.

I am eligible for $6,230.00 in grants, and $5,443.00 in federal loan. 
I was told that I can get an extra $4,000 for federal loan if my parents do no qualify for the parent PLUS loan.

The amount that needs to be borrowed with a private loan is $15,877.00.

My parents are not in a position to assist me financially.

What is recommended for me to do?
If I were to take a private loan, what institution would be a good one to go to?

Bitcoin,"Could major corruption and scamming in the Altcoin market affect Bitcoin negatively, positively, or neutrally?","If any of you have seen the kind of stuff that goes on in the Altcoin industry, it's a huge opportunity for regulators and politicians to gain leverage over all crypto currencies with the average person's permission.

What kind of problems are we talking about here? 

1. Premines/unfair distribution that get dumped on investors.
2. Large pump and dump teams that are involved/control a coins dev team, crypto currency exchanges, and have a celebrity like status to many investors. (Examples are Keycoin done by Promtheus and Koolio's team)
3. Huge webs of social media accounts, reddit accounts, Bitcointalk accounts, etc... controlled by pump and dump teams. 
 

My thinking is with a large amount of what the Feds would call criminal activity, the altcoin house of horrors could damage crypto currencies image in the media. This could also become a huge reason for regulators and politicians to target all crypto currencies including Bitcoin.

Not many known about or even realize how bad things are. As a result, wencould act sooner rather than later to remove or fix this major target.

Can we do anything to clean this mess up? Will this be damaging to Bitcoin? Should we even do anything? How many people truly realize how corrupt the altcoin market is?",cryptocurrency,1408424425
personalfinance,I want to live in a van down by the river... literally! How can I do it right?,"Well not necessarily the river part.

But here's the thing.

I'm never home. Ever. All I do is sleep there, shower there, and take mail there.

When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is shower and leave. I don't return until I'm so tired I'm ready to sleep again. I only eat out and 95% of the time I spend in my apartment is sleeping.

The only possessions I own are a backpack I take wherever I go, a suitcase full of mostly clothes, and a mattress to sleep on. And my precious childhood stuffed animal. He will be with me until the die I die, goddamnit.

As such, I've been bouncing back and forth between the smallest, crappiest, tiniest, most minimalist apartments with as many room mates as possible for many years to keep the monthly cost of having a place to sleep as small as possible.

I've just gone through my once-annual room mate shuffle where people move on and do different things with their lives. It's forcing me to look for another place to keep monthly costs low. Again.

And boy does doing this every year get old.

Especially when I live in a place where rent is so massively inflated and rising all the time that it's a huge expense. Seriously, hop on craigslist and look at the eye-popping rent in the SF bay area. I live in the south bay where it ain't so bad, but it's still pretty fucking bad!

Anyway, this all got me thinking, fuck it, why not just live in a van? If I got one of those cargo vans and tossed my mattress in it, that should do me fine. Car insurance is a lot cheaper than rent and the weather is nice enough here year-round that I shouldn't have to worry about freezing to death. If I get a decent sleeping bag or some camping gear I should be fine in the mild winters. Not having a toilet isn't a problem for me because I have no need to get up in the middle of the night to pee.

I also have the luxury of being able to shower at work and even if I couldn't, I could always get a gym membership for that.

I could move my mail to a PO box (although I'm not sure HR would take kindly to my address relocating to a PO box...? Can I do that?) and I already do my laundry at a laundromat anyway.

The biggest thing that worries me about this idea is where the fuck can I safely park this thing? I haven't lived in the safest neighborhoods over the last several years, but I get a feeling sleeping in a van is less safe than sleeping in an apartment in a crappy neighborhood. Another concern is how much should I expect to pay for a decent used cargo van with no windows in the back that won't break down on me? I got plenty of cash saved up, so I'm not worried about the cost. I just want to find the best deal and I don't know much about autos.

So tell me reddit, how can I make this work? And what challenges am I not considering?

**TL;DR: I want to sleep in a van in the SF bay area (south bay preferred). What van do I buy? How do I park it safely and legally? Any other advice?**",finance,1408425591

personalfinance,Would like to open second checking and savings accounts ASAP for basic (grad student) purposes and prepare to start a Roth IRA but unsure about the different possible ways to go about it…,"Been lurking for a bit but couldn’t find a post with a similar situation. Made an account so I could get some advice since none of my friends know either. I have minimal knowledge of anything relating to finance so forgive me for any wrong terminology or holes in my thinking process. 

Some background: I'm a soon-to-be first year grad student with a stipend and zero debt. I currently have checking and savings accounts and a credit card with Wells Fargo. My stipend is more than enough to cover rent, utilities, health insurance, food, clothing, etc. and am likely able to save a couple hundred a month if I’m serious about it.

The hiccup/situation: Moving to a state where WF is not a viable banking option. I’d realistically like to keep my WF accounts.

My monthly stipend will directly deposit into my WF checking account and I’ll transfer different amounts to respective accounts from there. I’d like to open a new checking account primarily so I can withdraw cash (I tend to use cash for everyday purchases since it makes me more aware of my spending habits) from an ATM without a fee. 

I’d also like to open a new savings account to serve as my EF that can also earn some interest (but more than WF’s rate) while just sitting there. I budgeted a portion of my stipend as general ""savings."" My plan is to use this amount to build a decent EF in this account, and once it’s established, maintain it and put this ""savings"" amount into a Roth IRA. (Does that even make sense?) In this case, should I close my WF savings account? I don’t really see a huge harm in keeping it open (I think the required minimum is fairly low/couple hundred for my account), but I don’t really know.

Just a bit confused/overwhelmed with the different ways I could think to go about this… probably overthinking things a bit. Some options that sound good in my head but no idea if they’re good in reality:

1. Open Ally checking and savings (probably Online Savings) accounts since many people here like Ally. I hesitate because there are a lot of negative reviews online, especially about customer service’s lack of knowledge, problems setting up accounts, etc. But I do like how Ally is an online platform, no ATM fees and has a better interest rate on the savings account. I thought about just opening a Money Market savings account because it comes with a check card, but ultimately, I’d prefer two separate accounts to prevent myself from accidentally dipping into my EF/savings.

2. Open a Charles Schwab checking account and either an Ally or Barclays online savings account. Charles Schwab and Barclays seem well liked/have good service and same pros as Ally mentioned above. But it seems like a possible hassle to have accounts at three (if I include WF) different places? Or is this normal? Additionally, the actual $$ amounts won’t be that much for my first year of grad school, so I don’t know if there’d be a significant difference between an Ally or Barclays savings account.

I thought about opening accounts at a local credit union where I'll be but ruled this option out.

Also, the WF website said they might charge a fee for something like transferring money from a WF account to a non-WF account but that’s not very definitive. Does anyone know if WF charges a fee for these kinds of transfers? And to double check, Ally, Charles Schwab and Barclays don’t charge a fee if I transfer money from WF to them, correct? 

Lastly, like I mentioned earlier, I’d ideally and eventually like to open and contribute to a Roth IRA starting my second(?) year of grad school (once I get a better handle of my budget and establish my EF). I looked up my school’s financial/stipend info, and it looks like my stipend will be considered earned income. Is there a specific checking/savings account combination that would be most beneficial for when I start a Roth IRA or for the long run in general? 

I’m moving in a few days and just realized WF might not be the best banking option where I’m going, and it’s clearly stressing me. Would really appreciate any help or suggestions. Thanks in advance!

edit: Thanks for everyone's advice! I'll probably go the Charles Schwab checking account route since I could start my Roth IRA/future investing there, and there's a branch near my school. Since there doesn't seem to be a huge difference between the savings accounts options, I'll probably pick one that has an easy to use website.",finance,1408443003

personalfinance,Handling $15K in Credit Card Debt,"Hello r/personalfinance! My wife and I have generally strong credit (low 700s), but during/just after grad school we accumulated a lot of credit card debt. Things are in really good shape now, and it’s time to get rid of this albatross. Here’s the facts:

We’re both in great jobs with solid incomes. We’ve managed to save up some money, and our bank account is very healthy. All debt payments, including credit cards and student loans (pretty minimal – we got good funding through grad school), are made on time and without trouble. But this credit card debt is a burden, and we want to get rid of it.

We have three credit cards, all with pretty lame interest rates (18-23%). The debt load is split with about $4k on the each of the higher-interest cards, and about $8K on the lowest. We pay, in total, about $500-$700 a month toward these cards, of which about $300 (maybe a little less) is eaten up by interest. 

We’d like to pay this down a lot more aggressively. We don’t have any reason to take on more credit card debt in the coming future, and have accumulated no more since things got stable (March-ish). While we have some money saved up, we really want to put most of that toward a real vacation – something we haven’t take in many, many years. Our monthly income is now solidly beyond our expenditures, so we think that we can definitely afford to take a huge chunk out of this debt month-by-month.

The question is – how? With almost half of our current repayment budget being eaten by interest, how do we get ahead? We’ve been looking into consolidation options, and that’s where I have questions:

* At first, finding a no-frills card with no balance transfer fee seemed to be the way to go – particularly since many cards won’t charge interest for the first year or so. In 15 months, we could make a HUGE dent in this debt. Both those seem pretty rare – and it’s unlikely we’ll find something that we can consolidate all our debt into. I’ve also learned that this can be a bit of a hit toward your credit. Any suggestions on a good card? How hard is the credit hit?
* The other option that looks reasonable is a personal line of credit through our bank. As far as I understand it, they’ll pay off all our debts and we then pay them a single payment on that lump sum – likely with an interest rate that could be about half of what we are paying now. What are the hidden costs here? What is the process like? What if we get offered a shitty interest rate? Is it better to have a consolidated loan with our bank with only a marginally better rate, than debt spread across three cards?
* What other options are out there? Are there any specific financial institutions I should be looking into? What say you, oracles of personal finance?

Thanks in advance for your willingness to read/help!

***Edit: People seem to be focusing on my comment re: a vacation. If you can focus on the questions I have, that would be great. The vacation is a long way off, and we're not going to dump the limited savings we have into debt - its not enough to make a huge difference, and we need to make sure we have money on-hand for emergencies. Relying on credit cards to cover sudden costs is how we got here in the first place.***

***Edit Part Deux: THANK YOU. This has been great. Some plans affirmed, some fallacies corrected, some suggestions heeded. I really appreciate all of you taking the time with this. I promise to give you all a Triumphant Thursday post when this all gets handled.***",finance,1408453521

personalfinance,I'm a full-time student who just lost all of my income. I need advice.,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I am a full-time student.  In March, I was hired as an intern at a local company.  They asked me to stay for the summer, which required me to move off campus and into an apartment.  They said I could stay until I graduated in May 2015, but last week, the intern program was ended, and they laid off about 10% of employees.

I have a scholarship that pays for all of my school needs (tuition, supplies, etc.), but it only pays for room and board if I'm living on campus.  In my financial aid account, I have a ton of scholarship money, but I do not have access to it.  It is left over from the money I would be using if I lived in a dorm.

Now that I lost my job, I have no income to pay for rent/utilities at my apartment.  I also cannot get a student loan, because I have reached the limit of money I can have in my student account.  Also, my transmission blew in my car, and that is going to cost about $3500 to fix (which is more than I have in savings).

So basically, I have no income, I'm not eligible for a student loan, I owe $3500 to get my car fixed, and I have about $700 of bills per month.  I have no idea what to do.

**Edit:**
If anyone is still reading this, I talked to my bank about a personal loan.  Any loan I get will have a 20% interest rate.  They said it's high because I'm only 21.  I have a credit score of about 760, but apparently that doesn't help.

I've submitted about 15 applications for jobs but haven't heard anything.  I did find a way to maybe get about half of the money from my student account (~$2500) which will help, but not much.",finance,1408458447

personalfinance,Need Credit Card Help,"Hi Everyone,

I have a lot of credit card debt from previous years that I need help with. I've already started using YNAB and that has helped (even though it's only been barely a month). Here's a breakdown of my debt:


Credit Union Credit Card - $2,133.20 (13% APR)

Kay's Credit Card - $2,427.77 (19% APR)

Discover Credit Card 1 - $2,259.67 (24% APR)

Discover Credit Card 2 - $1,252.35 (24% APR)

Furniture Credit Card - $2,162.86 (9.99% APR for now, but about to hit a 29.99% APR penalty if I don't pay this balance within a year)


In total, I have $10,235.85 in credit card debt. In all, I pay close to the minimum payment on each which in total equate to roughly $400 for all of these cards.

I checked Lending Club for a loan of $10.3K to consolidate all this debt and they are offering me a 10.15% Interest rate, 12.98% APR for 3 years with a monthly payment of $333.08.

My other option that they are also offering me would be a $10.3K loan at 13.98% interest rate, 16.31% APR for 5 years with a monthly payment of $239.56.


All in all, I'm leaning towards the 3 year option. I'm new to this, so any advice would be appreciated. I plan on shredding my cards if I go this route :)

gaming,What the hell is going on? [serious],"I am a casual subscriber. I don't know that much about bleeding-edge games except ""oooo pretty."" I just like to read interesting things that I see here. Now, I noticed a bunch of crazy bullshit and a thread with 11k+ (at this instant) *deleted comments.*

I have no pre-judgment. I don't even know what's going on or who these people are that are mentioned in the link.  I don't want some fedora-neckbeard using this as a chance to soap box about fighting the power. I don't want some mod to delete this because I think it is important to have a calm discussion every once in a while. 

So, does anyone care to explain why this subreddit just imploded? And please, respect the serious tag. No witch-hunting. I'm just a curious bystander. 

EDIT: May I again stress that I don't want any comments here attacking the mods here. I don't care if they are wrong. Just facts please. Leave the Che shit someplace else.  

*edit 1.5: someone pointed out these edits 1 &amp;amp; 2 are conflicting. Each chronological update usurps the previous one. I didn't want mods being criticized at first so this didn't get Hiroshima'd. Once it became apparent that it was allowed to exist, further discussion could be asked for.*

EDIT 2: In case this is actually productive, I welcome the mods to address any points brought up. I have literally no vested interest here. I have no agenda. Besides being entertained by all the pitchfork-wielding, as a subscriber (even a filthy casual) I just would like a resolution.  There's no reason why this can't be resolved through level-headed explanation and discussion.  

EDIT 3: The mods have posted a very sane response. [It is currently stickied.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/2dzrlv/on_zoe_quinn_censorship_doxxing_and_general/) Please limit the soap boxing here. I really don't care to read another comment with some sideways criticism of someone's character or morals.  

**EDIT 4.2: OK - My original question is answered. There are several dozen replies below outlining the sequence of events. You can stop posting recaps now.** Anyone curious as to what happened can find multiple versions in the comments. Thank you. 

It seems that we are entering that plateau that follows the bulk of the issue being exposed. This is the point where the conjecture regarding the major points of what happened stops and the countless thousands of posts speculating and opining on the fine details begins. Feel free to rant away, but please keep all comments within reddits rules. No witch hunting. No hateful verbal abuse of any individuals involved. If people did some wrong stuff, talk about how to fix it. Talk about why it's wrong. Spare the ""Person A did some bad things and Person B is in on it. They're a big meanie head! I'M TELLING MOM!""

*For the people that think I'm the reddit police - stop. I just was a casual reader who asked the question at the right time and just so happen to enjoy polite discussion as opposed to outright, foul-mouthed, shit-shaming, finger-pointing, reckless conjecture and accusations.  Having said that, I cannot stop you from commenting how you choose.  I just don't want to see it get too mean-spirited, and if me asking for that is too much for you, then I apologize.*

personalfinance,pay of student loan student loan?,"So  I've fought the good fight and only have have a few hundred bucks left on my student loan, and the next item on my financial list is to purchase a home within the next year or so.

technology,"Do people really think that most municipalities have the wherewithal to design, build &amp; manage a complex fiber network?","I know how badly we all want gigabit internet to happen.  But don't you think there is some credence to these laws banning municipalities from building out fiber to the home and managing their own network?  Most of these little towns &amp; counties can just barely manage their own finances currently on the books.  Add in a complex &amp; technologically advanced fiber network, and one begins to wonder whether the risk is worth the reward.  

Provo got lucky, had just the right amount of debt, and Google came to save the day.  Of course the other areas around Provo, the ones we never talk about, that built out fiber to the home were SOL.  They amassed such a large amount of debt that Google wouldn't even touch them.  

Then you have to tack on the fact that the demand for fiber is still virtually non-exsistant.  Yeah, you can sell the fiber to redditors, but what about the rest of the community who is perfectly happy with what they have and don't want to switch yet?  So now you've built a beautiful, advanced fiber-to-the-home network in your municipality, you have a huge amount of debt, operating costs are not cheap, and to top that off you're having a hell of a time getting most people to sign up.  So your town is just hemorrhaging cash.  In the process your towns credit rating has taken a nosedive from all the borrowing, and as you have to borrow more money, interest rates get increasingly severe.  

I'm not saying that this would happen to every little town.  But don't fool yourself into thinking that it wouldn't happen to most.  


Maybe what we need are amended laws that put into place a rigorous system where towns can submit thorough proposals and have them approved or denied by a specific board of people.  But at the end of the day, the unfortunate fact is that ISPs are going to be the ones to build this stuff out because they are generally the ones who are going to be able to stomach the costs--they're built for it.  Towns can barely fix their roads.  Most places aren't built to withstand the financial strain of building expensive fiber to the home, maintaing it, all while losing money knowing that one day they might start raking it in (or likely will).",technology,1408468560

personalfinance,Student Loan vs Roth IRA,"Back in January I opened a Roth IRA with Fidelity.

So I've been thinking about what to do after I reach that $2500 (since I won't be required to put more money in after that).

I currently have about $42k in student loan debt, that I've been paying off for almost a year now (with an interest rates from 3.4%-8%).  And I've been paying about $440 a month on those all together (higher than my minimum by a good amount).

So once I'm finished with my $2500 to my Roth IRA, should I continue doing as I have been, and pay $200/mo on my IRA, and $440 on my loans, or should I put more/all of my future payments toward my student loans?",finance,1408470340

personalfinance,Opinions on how I'm going to handle my money?,"I've just received a full time offer to a company and was looking to see if any of you had thoughts on how I plan on budgeting my money once I start employment. Now I recently graduated college and have ~25k in loans that I'm looking to pay off fairly quickly(&lt; 3 years). The loans are a combination of mostly subsidized loans and some smaller unsubsidized loans, both around 3 to 6%, and all entirely federal. The company that will be hiring me is basically going to have me on salary @ 65k a year. Now I've read most of the FAQ section and am preparing to set up the emergency fund in a savings account and budget out the remainder of my money accordingly. Now while I'll be working, I'm planning on living at home so rent and some of my food expenses will be covered, which basically means that I'll be planning on spending a good chunk of my income on any outstanding debt that I may have.

The one area that I'm a little unsure of myself is in the retirement area. Now my company won't be matching me in a 401k or any plan like that for the first year of my employment, however after the first year this changes to 7% matching (obviously something I want to take full advantage of when its available). After my first year, I think it'd be wise to have my Emergency Fund goal met and basically move that monthly allowance (and another $300/month or so) into 401k matching. I've also got a nice 10% profit sharing after a year, so I'm not too too worried about setting up retirement accounts, at least until my situation changes.

This leads me to believe that my best plan for the next year or so would be to set up my emergency fund (My goal is $6k, at least until I move out) and to pay of loans until I can start doing employer matching. I'm also planning on buying a car(~$20,000) in the coming months and financing it over something like 3-4 years for little to no interest w/ co-signing, existing good credit. I'm not in any particular rush to fill up the emergency fund since I will be living at home so I wont be losing my house or anything like that, so really I'd just have to worry about car payments and loans, but I could obviously be paying much less towards the loans than I'm currently planning on. (Guess I should add in that I've got decent job security too).

Here's the layout of my plan for the next 12 months:

Total monthly salary(after taxes): $4000

* Student Loans: $1000/month =&gt; 25%
 
* Car Payment: ~$300/month =&gt; 7.5% (Planning on sinking a 5k sign-on into the upfront cost)

* Gas: $500/month (The commute is a little brutal) =&gt; 12.5%

* Emergency Fund:  $115/month =&gt; 2.875% 

* Food/Bars: $500/month =&gt; 12.5%

* Remainder: $1585/month =&gt; 40%

Now this is only a rough outline for the next year or so, and now that I've typed it all out it looks like I basically have more month than I know what to do with.. Even if I increased my Food/Bars budget (I uhh like to live a somewhat fun lifestyle I guess?) I'd still have a huge chunk of my income just sitting around.

Anyone have any thoughts on how I should redistribute the excess cash or some type of account to put it into? Preferably not retirement I guess, I'm too young to justify sinking 30%+ of my income into something I can't touch for 40 years. I'm sure that someone might say that my emergency fund isn't big enough so if someone has a better idea of what it should be, feel free to speak up.

solar,Help with design: A controller and AGM battery in an enclosed space ???,"Intention: Need help in my so far theoretical design.

About me: noob in solar power but learning. 

Level of investment: ~$500 for everything but mostly 60% is for  computer related parts. So, I'd prefer to stay away from expensive parts. One, this whole setup possibly can be stolen. Second, these electronics possibly can be flooded and destroyed. So, I am going for a conservative shopping. 

My application: to operate a very low powered computer on a remote floating platform in the middle of a lake for water surface and depth temperature recording. The platform is about 20 by 15 feet but I cannot mount anything on the top but solar power pole with the panels. The ""guts"" will have to be stashed under the platform. There is a bit less than 1 feet clearance under the platform before water level.

Solar equipment specs: 2 x 20watt panels, 1 x 30A PWM controller, 4 x 8Ah AGM batteries.

Description of a possible setup: The system would include a pole with 2 solar panels feeding a power cable under the platform. Under the platform there is about a feet of clearance before water surface. I'm thinking of putting my setup sealed in a ""5 gallon home depot"" type of bucket properly silicone weatherproofed with no holes. On the top of the bucket lid I will mount ""bulkhead"" type of connectors to come though the lid to allow connection on the top, this will allow weather proof connectors through the top semi-dry part of the bucket. Top of the bucket will also feature an over-pressure release valve for venting any overpressured gas, but mostly will allow to vent the bucket without breaking the silicone seals. The valve is the type scuba divers have on their wing's bladder.

1) I read that batteries should not be within a confined amount of space, even AGM. But I cannot see how to mount the batteries without exposing them to the elements like rain, moisture, waves. What would be your suggestions in this case, something within my price range?

2) I don't know how hot controllers get. From my research, PWM may not be most efficient, but they run cooler. Would it be fair to say? Would it be running cool enough to be enclosed in 5 gallon bucket? Computer is very low power, it will hardly add any heat as it will be operational only a few mins an hour. The bucket would be 80% submerged, should allow for some heat exchange.",energy,1408478772
personalfinance,Grad Student needs advice on $4k in credit card debt.,"Hello /r/PersonalFinance! I am a 24-year-old student starting grad school full-time this fall. I have $2k in savings, $4k in credit card debt, and a credit score of 750.

All of my debt is on one card - which has a 0% promotional interest rate until September 2015. For the rest of my credit cards, I make small purchases and pay them off in-full every month.

My financial aid through school will cover roughly 85% of my expenses (rent, car payment, food, gas, electric, cable, etc.) I am planning to get a job that will cover the rest of my base expenses and give me a little more for hair cuts, clothes, going out, etc. 

So here is my question…
What do I do with the $2k I have in savings? I have never had my credit card balance as high as $4k so it’s giving me serious anxiety. In my mind I have three options:

* (1) I can to apply the $2k I have in savings to the credit card balance and continue to whittle the rest down through September (but that leaves me with absolutely no cushion for emergencies, or if I have trouble finding a job).
* (2) I can pay off the $4k with monthly payments of $333 which would have it all paid off by the time the promotional rate ends (but honestly, I do not know if I’ll be able to afford this). I would keep the $2k for emergencies.
* (3) I can slowly chip away at the $4k and, come next summer, transfer the balance to one of my other cards for an additional 0% promotional rate period. (I hate this idea because that means this balance will be hanging over my head for a long time). In this plan, I’d keep the $2k for emergencies.

In the long-run, my financial problems are far from severe. But as someone who struggles with anxiety, this high balance is really making me feel uneasy. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",finance,1408482709

personalfinance,Behind on some bills and my auto finance company always offers more money,"And I haven't taken a vacation in 5-6 years.  The kids really want to do something before summer is over.

I work in middle management on a salary of less than $40k a year.  I am perfectly capable of holding down a better paying job, but I took this position for the nice line it will hold on my resume.  I decided that it would be better to skimp by on a meager income with the possibility of getting a much better position when I have more experience under my belt.  This is my first management gig and being almost 35 I needed this.  Because of my efforts, I have a real opportunity to get in with a big tech company early next year after a new facility wing is built.

My current bills are like 90% of my income which leaves very little wiggle room for ANYTHING.   This summer ruined my wiggle room.  With the heat we have in my area, NOT running the A/C isn't an option (100+ in the day and sometimes not below 85 at night).  My utility bill for the last 2 months have been in excess of $300 (water, sewer, garbage electricity is all billed together). 

Due to my less-than-optimal credit, the family vehicle is on a 22% loan.  I've been making all my payments on time and I have also been paying more than I owe (by about $10 a month or so).  The way this finance company works is they take any extra you pay and apply it to the next month so after several months of over paying I'm already like $100 ahead on the next months payment.  This has come in a little handy when I need extra money to keep the power on in the house.

So now here I am still owing about $200 to the utility company, I'm behind on internet and TV (which I'm about to shut off and eat the ETF).  Hulu/netflix will save me like $65 a month which would help. 

Here are my bills as of right now:  Income is $1167 every 2 weeks
Rent: $950 
  
Utilities (water, power, garbage, sewer): ~$300
  
Car payment: $312
  
Car insurance: $136 (2 drivers, 2 cars. One full coverage, one minimum)
  
Cell phones: $136 (2 lines, minimum data)
  
DirecTV: $85
  
Frontier DSL  (because FU cable monitoring): $75
  

Food isn't an issue because thankfully we get assistance for that.  Not sure how I could feed 3 kids on that kind of income.  Entertainment consists of whatever we can find on TV/internet.  Me and the wifey don't go out drinking and are very much forced home bodies.  The kids just got a goodwill shopping trip and I'd like to get them at least a couple of reasonably priced new things for school.
  
Yes, I know the housing is a bigger part of my budget than I should be paying, but I had it planned to where it would be feasible and I opted again to live on a tight budget and give the kids a good home to live in instead of some  shitty cramped apartment in a crummy part of town with the crummy schools.
  
So now that that's out of the way, I'm very seriously considering getting an extension on my loan to help catch up on bills, get the kids a few things for school, take them somewhere before school starts next week and have some left over for a Christmas fund.   This extension would come with a refinance on my interest rate, but this particular lending institution doesn't offer rates below 20% (basically legal loan shark without the risk of broken fingers/knees/legs).
  
I know that getting this loan isn't a good idea by any means, but I'm out of ideas.  I don't have any family that can help out financially and credit cards will just get me in a bigger mess than I am right now.

What do I do? Can I explain the situation to these creditors and close the accounts, or would that ruin my credit even more? I did some reading from the FAQ about credit, but I didn't quite see anything that answers my question. I know that having multiple accounts open, but not in use, is good. But what about closing multiple? I do plan on paying them off eventually, ideally before my student loan payments are due in November.

How can I save my credit and gain privacy all while not ruining my family? I don't want to press charges, nor do I want my mom to use one of these accounts only to find that the transaction has been declined. I don't know what exactly she's using the cards for, all I know are the balances.

personalfinance,Should I continue receiving student loans even if I don't need them?,"Somebody once told me to get all the money I can as a student because it's the cheapest money you can get.  
I have about 4 loans of $4000 that I have received, the interest rate is very low (somewhere between 3.5%-5%). The fourth loan I have just been offered is for $4500.  
Is there any good reason for me to accept this loan and use it to pay off old loans or interest? Or too keep it around for a day I may need it (whether it be for personal or business use), because generally, student loans are cheaper than say, a business loan or payday type loans.  Also, would it be advantageous to apply it to my auto loan that has a remaining balance of ~$5,800 2 3.15% APR?  

I don't need the money right now, I'm skating by and still in school so I am not required to make payments yet on my loans.

I have ~60k in student loans, split about 2/3 private and 1/3 federal.

personalfinance,General question about federal student loans going into repayment.,"Hey I just had a general question about how student loans enter repayment. So I am a junior in college right now, and have been taking federal student loans to help fund my education. So by the time I graduate I will have 4 subsidized student loans for an approximate total of $19K and 4 Unsubsidized loans for approximate amount of $8k (So a total of 8 loans for around $27K). Currently from the documentation I have that each loan will have its own $50 minimum payment and it says set of a ten year schedule, but because if the higher minimum payment all of them would be taken care in shorter terms (ranging between 2.5-4.5  years)

 So I just wanted to make sure that my assumption is right that each of these loans are treated as separately and i will have a $400 payment each month (my logic is the $50 time 8 loans), or all the subsidized loans be grouped and unsubsdized be grouped and treated as 2 separate bigger loans, or possibly be combined into one big loan. 

My question comes because the federal student loan calculators in the websites they link to seem to just take the total loan amount (in my case the $27K) and the average rate (which for me will be around 4.6-4.7%) and give a payment based on those numbers. So they are estimating my payment to be $280 on a 10-year schedule on those estimates. 

So is my payment going to be the $400 or $280 figure?",finance,1408516583
financialindependence,Financially Planning a Move,"My wife and I are considering our strategy for an upcoming move.  My employment, while it pays well, has not provided a raise of any kind in over six years and I know quite clearly that it won't.  This job is our primary form of income.  The remainder of our income comes from rental property either owned individually or in partnerships.

We own approximate 50% of the equity in our primary residence.  After the losses in the market we estimate that our home is worth 20-35% less than when we bought it, so a lot of our original equity is gone.  Fortunately we aren't underwater and our interest rate is fixed at 5% for thirty years.  We are six years into the mortgage.  The house in in terrible need of repairs as well, and we also are considering getting rid of a lot of our credit card debt.

All of that said, the combined taxes and mortgage payment use up approximately 40% of my salary.  Adding utilities, which are expensive where we live, and all living expenses that come in the form of monthly bills come to about 60-65% of my earned salary.  We've decided that this ratio needs to dramatically go down.  In other words we've decided to downsize.

The issue that I'm having difficulty with in pondering this is: is it better to take all of the equity and invest it in investment property, in a new (for us) but smaller home, or to split between the two?


Assume that after the sale of our existing home we'd have approximately US$400,000 to work with.

In the first scenario we would rent where we currently are and would likely rent a storage unit as well while we sort through our excess belongings.  All of that money would of course be gone, but we would have additional income.  After investing the money in rental property we could obtain an income stream of at least US$3,200 per month, or US$38,400 per year.  However our living expenses would likely exceed US$2,500 for rent, leaving us with only US$700 a month.  This assumes no vacancy in any of the rental property, which is unrealistic.  This version of the plan also assumes no new debt, so more aggressive plans could work here as well.  Conceivably we could borrow enough to double the proposed income of this plan but a lot of that money would be spent on mortgage payments and on setting money aside as a vacancy factor.

Assuming that we simply bought a smaller home or condo so as to have little or no debt and only the rental expense of a storage unit, we could feasibly limit our expenses to US$500 a month or less quite easily.  However, we would have no additional rental income and would be paying taxes on the new property, likely in excess of US$12,000 per year.

A hybrid plan, buy something but also acquire rental property, has some appeal.  We could conceivably reduce our overhead and gain additional income.  The downside however is that this plan involves going into debt again.  At the most aggressive, we could borrow enough to obtain an income of US$4,800 per month while still living in a somewhat comfortable home.  At that state we'd have debt a bit larger that what we currently have but would be covering that out of our new income stream as assistance.

And thoughts any of you might have would be appreciated.",finance,1408517046

Bitcoin,How the system is literally fisting everybody...and everybody is happy about that.,"I've posted an ad on a forum I use since years, a retro gaming community.

My ad was about selling a GCW-Zero from Kickstarter, great console, but I don't really use it often.
So I posted the ad, after a while got an answer and somebody bought it. After some PM, sent me the money via Paypal (I proposed Bitcoins...but you know) then I got the money on Paypal, minus the fee (146,02 USD minus 5.XX $ of fee).
So today I went to the post office to send this device, and then the people working there tell me nicely that I can not ship a device with a battery inside....that's super cool, because there is battery everywhere now, and he invited me to check DHL or Fedex.

So I go back home, and check the quote online, and Fedex just give me a quote of 163 $ for an Express delivery, or 128 $ for an Economic one...the package is 800 g, from Australia to France. So thank you for that really fair quote Fedex, and see you in hell...please you go first.

So I just want to thank Paypal for taking a fee of 5$ on a 146 $ transaction, and also thank the delivery/bullshitting system that force people to spend the price of the goods into delivery fees.

So yeah bla bla, I should have known that I can not send that kind of things overseas...but I actually just moved here couples of months ago.

So now I just explained to the buyer that he will not get the device, and I offered him to pay him back the money (+ his fees) via Paypal (and I'm gonna pay some fees on that too) or via Bitcoin.

financialindependence,"Advice about learning how to invest, for someone not living in the USA","I'm new to the subject of financial independence/early retirement. The seed was planted in my head a few years ago when I read those self-help books like Awaken the Giant Within, The Slight Edge, etc. 

At some point this sort of books always have a chapter about ""the power of compound interest"", usually with the example of the penny that doubles each day for a month, and with some calculations that show you how, if you only put your money in a safe investment that yelds 15% a year instead of wasting it.... 

At this point I usually started to call some friends that either work in banks or are studying economics, and everyone told me the same: ""are you crazy? there are no safe investments like that"". So I did some spreadsheets using more realistic interest rates, and I found out that there was no way I could ever reach financial independence in this life. Is it because in the USA there are more opportunities for investing? Is it because you must know someone in a particular circle to have access to this kind of safe, profitable investments?

And what can I do to explore my options? My problem is that in my country (Italy) I can't find any good guide for the layman. Italian books are of very low quality. In some instances they are just bad rip-offs of american books with poor attempts at translating the info, sometimes they are just quickly assembled with vague information and completely useless.

My question is, how lenient is Sally mae and do they offer any forgiveness programs or atleast a way to reduce the interest rate?

I'm worried about this because I have read private lenders are a lot tougher to deal with then if it were a federal loan.

personalfinance,Confused about how two balances with different interest rates will work on the same card. Need help!,"I have a Discover credit card with a $3700 balance. I received an offer from Discover with a few ""checks"" which I can use as regular checks. The money that I withdraw from these checks with have a 3% fee and an intro 0% APR for 12 months. I want to use these checks to buy a car. The car is worth $18000 and I will be paying $10k in cash and $8k from these checks. I calculated that paying a 3% fee is cheaper than what I would have to pay in interest if I got a car loan. 

So let's say I use the check for $8k. So my new balance will be 3700+8000 = 11700. 

In a few days when I get my next paycheck, I will want to pay off my $3700 balance. When I make a payment of that amount, will it be applied to the $3700 regular APR balance or the $8000 0% balance? If it applies to the 0% balance, that means that I will be stuck with clearing that out before I can even begin clearing out the $3700 balance, which really sucks. 

In that case, a better option for me would be to pay off the $3700 with my existing cash right now and then write the check for a larger amount. Of course this means the 3% fees would be more. 

I called discover twice and both times I got conflicting answers. One rep told me that the extra payments will be applied to the 0% balance and the other rep told me the opposite. This is what the FAQ section from the letter I got says:

""We will apply payments and credits at our discretion, including a manner most favourable and convenient to us.... we will generally apply amount you pay that exceed the minimum to balances with higher APRs prior to balances with lower APRs""

but then it also says

""if you transfer a balance of $1000 and then you make purchases of $1000 in the same billing cycle, we will charge interest on any balances not at a 0% promotional APR IF YOU DON'T PAY $2000 on the payment due date...""

This contradicts what the rep told me. Why do I need to pay $2000 to avoid interest. I only need to pay $1000. I would really appreciate if someone could guide me on this. I really need the money.

personalfinance,"Currently rebuilding credit, consolidated personal credit card debt (over 23k) with a loan to reduce interest","I spent my way into financial ruin while dating a girl I thought I was going to marry, and figured it was ok because my career was about to take off, circa 2007-2008. Fast forward 6 years, the great recession and my career didn't take off as intended leaving me at my current job making under 33k per year... oh and she cheated on me and left me with roughly 23k in credit card debt split up between 2 visa cards, amex, and discover at varying rates between 13% for amex to 27% with visa.  

I learned a few valuable lessons from the ages of 22-28... Never count your chickens before they hatch... Promised bonuses, raises, commission, etc don't mean shit until the funds are cleared in your account. Never try to bail out those in need that are too selfish to see the value in what you are doing for them. I helped my ex with her BMW &amp; credit card payments while she was in nursing school, and I was reckless with my spending habits and easily folded to her will. I doubt she appreciates a thing I did for her... then again, I can't fill up my gas tank with appreciation, or pay my rent with it either so its kind of a moot point.   

Since then, I've grown a spine and  demanded a raise and made over 45k last year including bonuses, and 2 weeks paid vacation. This year I should clear 50k, have 3 weeks paid vacation and actually have enough left over to save each month to put towards finishing my degree. 

In retrospect, her cheating on me ended a lot of unhealthy lifestyle choices I had going on, as well as the financial mistakes. It was quite possibly the best thing to ever happen to me since the cycle of reckless spending finally came to an end. The person I am dating now has encouraged me to resume pursuing my career dreams as well as reinforced the need for financial responsibility. It's actually the idea that I may have met someone I want to marry and some day purchase a house with that made me realize the importance of my credit rating in order to get approved for a mortgage.

The threads I've read on personal finance helped me out immensely and forced me to help tackle my smallest debts first, and as each one got crossed off the list it snowballed into bigger payments on larger balances. It was this tactic that my parents saw and my personal initiative on cutting back all unnecessary spending that made them feel comfortable in helping me get approved for a personal loan to eliminate the high interest rates by using their credit to rebuild my own. My credit score at it's lowest was in the 510 range and I can't wait to pull it in a few months to see how much it has hopefully improved.   

Now I use my cards mostly for monthly billing... Netflix, electirc bill, at&amp;t... Discover I use for 5% cash back on gas, visa is used for groceries, and my amex for any kind of large purchases otherwise it barely gets use (gotta love those points). My lifestyle was incredibly unhealthy and my attitude towards my personal finances was abysmal. I just wanted to say thank you to all those out there who help others with financial advice, I know it definitely helped me out as I not only am motivated to finish school, but also motivated to get healthy (went from 250lbs two years ago to 195 currently). It's truly a life changing experience. I just wanted to ask everyone if it seems I am going about this the right way, and what steps I can take to continue building my credit in a responsible manner to set myself up for future success?  

Tl;dr: I reduced interest payment rates from 17-23% rates down to 3% with a personal loan cosigned by someone with outstanding credit. Now I can see a light at the end of the tunnel and finally sleep at night instead of stressing about my finances. Oh and don't ever put the pussy on a pedestal.",finance,1408549903
personalfinance,Parent wants to use my credit for a house mortgage. Urgent advice appreciated. Lender calling in 5 hours...,"Hello, I've decided to use a throwaway account to keep this information anonymous. The lender is calling at 5:30pm EST and I'd like some advice before I take this phone call.

**Background**:

I'm 22 years old with decent credit and about to graduate from college in December. I don't plan on buying a home for ~5 years or so (want a wife and search for good family area first). I currently live an apartment near my university. My family has lived in this house for ~10 years renting, it went up for foreclosure 4 years ago because our landlord didn't know what he was doing. My parent's boss bought the house gratefully so we wouldn't go homeless on terms my parents buy it within 3 years. Financial troubles and poor planning resulted in it being today, 4 years later and my parent's boss needs an answer soon or he will be selling the house. My parents have crap for credit and were denied via the online application. My parents applied with my information and I was accepted and was told I'm getting a call in 5 hours to discuss the details... If I deny this, my parents will have 90 days to relocate or go homeless once the home is sold. And I doubt they would ever let this down knowing I'm the one who let them and my 3 younger siblings go homeless...

**Information**:

This mortgage would be for ~$55,000 and would be solely in my name. My parents have a few things in collections they planned on paying off which would boost up their credit. Afterwards they told me I can do one of three options to get the mortgage out of my name and into theirs. However, all require them to have the appropriate credit.

* Assumed loan
* Refinance
* Selling the house

I don't understand very well how any of those three options work or really how real estate works. This may be incorrect information my parents have fed me. I do know that you cannot have more than one house mortgage at a time and I don't want to be stuck paying for my parents house and living in an apartment until the mortgage is payed off if trouble occurs. I'm figuring worst case I can put it up for sale if it becomes too much of a burden on me, but I don't know if that is rational thinking. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

**EDIT:**

I would like to respond to all of you, but there's a lot more responses than I expected. It seems the general consensus is to NOT go through with this deal in any situation. This is the way I was leaning towards but my emotions were getting the best of me (worry of disappointment from my parents and their potential homelessness). Thanks to all of you I am deciding to cancel this agreement and talk to my parents about what I can do to help them in the potential endeavors forward. I don't think it's that bad of an idea to move on to a new chapter in life :). You are all fantastic people and have a great day!",finance,1408551487

Married/2 kids (I'm 34, wife 32)
Combined Income: $6800/month net

The only debt we have is a mortgage (230k @ 4.75, 25 years left), and my grad school loan balance of $17k at 6% (Federal Unsub), which is currently scheduled to enter repayment next May, but won't actually be due (thanks to pre-payment) for another year. 

The wife and I have $65k in 401k/403b/IRA, and she also has her state teacher pension (should pay $2k/month if she works to age 60). We also have $10k in a cash savings account, $1500 in a taxable Betterment account, and I just opened a Roth with $100 on a whim.

We keep a pretty good budget, so, after I make my $500 student loan pre-payment each month, I have $1000 or so left over. Previously, I was getting aggressive on the loan, but started thinking about needing more emergency fund, so I slowed that payment down and built cash up to $10k. 

My reasoning is that the interest on my loan is deductible, which actually places it around a 4.5% effective interest rate. I waffle between being desperate to be out from under it, to wanting to get a little ahead on the mortgage, to wanting to max out my roth and build up my taxable account....I like compounding interest. 

The minimum on my loan will be ~$300, and double that won't be a problem with our budget. 

I've talked myself in circles, so I'd like to know, what would you do in our situation? We're also slowly tightening up the budget more, and I have a side gig that should start producing another $1k or so a month in October. Do I keep the cash I have on hand, then go ballistic on the loan, or do I pay $500/month for the next 3.5 years while putting the extra cash into investments? Both have benefits and drawbacks. 

I'm done with my MBA in October, and want a plan set before then. So, Reddit...tell me what I'm doing wrong :)",finance,1408558310

personalfinance,Federal Loan Forgiveness,"Hi all- I am currently enrolled in (year 4 of) a 10-year government student loan forgiveness program.  If I stay current in my monthly payments, all my remaining loans and interest will be forgiven after year 10, as all my loans are the type that qualify.  

The conditions (stay in a Govt or 501(c)3 job for 10 years) look reasonable, given what my profession is and what the growth in my profession is estimated to be.   

So, the question.... given I just need to maintain monthly minimum payments for 6 years, is there ANY incentive to paying my loans off aggressively before that time?  I have over 100K (I know, I know...) in student loans from my undergrad and professional degrees, so we are talking about an enormous amount of debt being ""forgiven.""  However, until that time my debt burden is a horrifically high number.

Luckily, I have a monthly student loan payment that is very achievable.  I also have no private student loans, car payments, mortgage, etc. I'd love to be debt free, but as this program will forgive over 100K of debt, I don't see any incentive to NOT just wait it out.",finance,1408559230

personalfinance,"Just got out of professional school with around 200k in loans, income about 50k. Question about repayment.","As title, I currently have about 175k of graduate school debt, and about 25k of undergraduate debt. Around 15k of that 200k is from interest that is set to capitalize around December. I'm working at an established non-profit (satisfies the PSLF criteria) making about 50k/yr. I'm single with no dependents.

I'm specifically asking about two programs: Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. My understanding is PSLF stipulates that after 120 payments under an income-based repayment plan such as PAYE, the remainder of the loan balance is forgiven. 

I qualify for partial financial hardship (PFH) and under PAYE:
&gt; ""Unpaid interest capitalizes if you are determined to no longer have a partial financial hardship, but the total amount of interest that capitalizes while you are repaying your loans under the Pay As You Earn plan is limited to 10% of your original principal balance when you begin paying under Pay As You Earn""

So this brings me to my question:

I was given a total of 25k cash as a gift by parents/relatives/etc. to do whatever I wanted with it. Originally, I was simply going to spend it all paying off the 15k interest (prior to capitalization) and then sink the remaining 10k into paying off loans with the highest interest rates. However, given the PSLF/PAYE programs, this might not be the smartest thing to do since I would have a huge chunk of my loans forgiven after 10 years. In that case, would it be smartest to invest/put into high APR savings/etc. that 25k instead of paying my loans?",finance,1408560916

Bitcoin,20 Days Left: Best practices for submitting BitLicense comments to NYDFS,"TL;DR: Everyone capable of writing articulate, cogent public comments to NYDFS should take the time to send an email to Mr. Dana Syracuse if you haven't already.  

Here's how and why:


Over the past few weeks, I have highlighted eloquent public responses to the proposed BitLicense framework from Circle executives, the Mercatus Institute, and various individual bitcoin enthusiasts.  Many other leading bitcoin companies will respond directly to the NYDFS with carefully crafted comments that highlight their specific concerns in the coming weeks.  Of course, I have also contributed my own thoughts via this blog, and will continue to do so throughout the rest of the public comment period.  

So it might be easy for you, the individual enthusiast, or you, the casual investor, or you, the student entrepreneur, to assume that your feelings and perspectives have been or will be properly covered by the myriad other responses.

In truth, it's a fair assumption that the only comments which actually rise to the top of the NYDFS pile for real consideration will be those sent by larger advocacy groups, funded virtual currency startups, institutional investors, and the law firms representing those groups.

But that doesn't mean that smart, polished individual contributions are wastes of time.  On the contrary, when it comes to many important subjects, such as advocacy for a safe harbor provision for startups and arguments in favor of limited regulation of open-source software, these perspectives will be invaluable.  

Whether they are read in their entirety initially means very little actually.  However, whether you realize it or not, we're already prepping for part two of what will be a lengthy turf war: the BitLicense courtroom battles.

The BitLicense lawsuits, ""discovery"" &amp; ""arbitrary and capricious"" standards

A quick conversation with any of bitcoin's top legal experts or executives will give you a clear indication that many of the BitLicense's proposals are almost guaranteed to be fought in court.  As a regulator, you simply don't pare back your initial guidelines drastically, regardless of the public outcry.  Maybe the NYDFS clarifies its loosest language and strips its most outlandish requirements, but the core proposals will still be an onerous and crippling overreach of power.  And they will have to be challenged aggressively.

There's an element of face-saving in play.  Politicians and their regulatory cousins simply don't admit fault very easily.  This is especially true given the time, energy and resources that this particular department has thrown at crafting these initial proposals.  Lawsky and his colleagues seem likely to default to strict rules and overreach because it is easier to be tough on crime than permissive of disruptive innovation - in terms of both talking points and future political (and financial) backing on Wall Street. 

Thus, we need to start digging in for a prolonged battle when it comes to many of the provisions that matter most to bitcoin's future viability.  

The Bitcoin community needs to submit droves of comments that can later be referenced in lawsuits against the department related to its ""arbitrary and capricious"" prescriptions.  Every well-spoken entrepreneur or $1,000 bitcoin investor should send comments which bash requirements that overreach relative to existing federal regulations of MSBs, or that restrict unsanctioned releases of open-source software of any kind, or that include non-financial applications under its broad scope.

Your comments really only need three things.  

The first is context.  Who are you?  Why should your comments be taken seriously (assume by a judge, not the department)?  And how will the BitLicense harm you?  On the last point, it is key to focus on how the proposals will unfairly and potentially illegally harm you.  You need not cover everything wrong with the BitLicense (others will do that for you), but specificity is key.

The second, then, is specificity.  Be direct and specific about which elements of the BitLicense are flawed in their language, scope or essence.  Use specific examples and highlight precedents from other technological turf wars (the internet, VoIP, etc.), and keep it concise and powerful.  

Finally, the third is recommendations.  It isn't enough to crap on the BitLicense's very existence.  (Regulators gonna regulate.)  What you need to do is highlight specific language in the proposals and suggest actual improvements or outright redactions.  If you haven't yet read Jerry Brito's public comments out of the Mercatus Center, it might inform your own approach.

Any public comment which is smart, devoid of rhetoric, and includes these three elements will be valuable in ""discovery"", the legal procedures used to gather evidence for any future lawsuits.  A future plaintiff representing the interests of bitcoin should have dozens of readily available resources which hammer the department for ignoring the reasonable pushback of the broader community on the most outlandish components of the BitLicense.  (These documents are easily obtained through a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, request.) 

How then should you actually submit public comments?  

As a community, we have just 20 more days to submit comments to the NYDFS related to the BitLicense.  All of this ""testimony"" should be electronic and submitted to Mr. Dana Syracuse via email at dana.syracuse@dfs.ny.gov.  It appears that we have until close of business on Monday, September 8 to submit comments, but Perkins Coie recommends getting all final comments in prior to midnight on Friday, September 5 just to be safe.

The statements that I started receiving from them stated that $0.00 was due, for months.

I had no idea this was the case, but cool, I was not going to argue.  Due to some major family health issues the past year, I was not paying particular attention to bills stating no amount was due.  However, I finally called again recently because this just made little sense to me.

- A higher down payment affords me with a significantly lower interest rate/prevents the need for mortgage insurance.

- My bonus doesn't pay out as early as I believe it will and I need a little extra for a down payment. In this case, I would live off the bonus once it hits and pump a couple paychecks back into my IRA/401K.

personalfinance,What to do with student loans (federal) after receiving substantial scholarship?,"Here is my scenario (sorry for the long post)


I am half way through gradate school (part time 2 years full time 2 years)
I have taken out a total of 41,000 in federal loans from the first and second years of school combined but have been able to pay my tuition out of pocket from working full time, so this amount has been sitting in 2 separate money market accounts. This year and next I will be working part time (so much less money)...

This summer I have been award two very large scholarships. One for $15,000 total from my employer to be disbursed over 2 years at $3500 twice a year as long as I pass all of my classes and remain a part time employee for the duration of my education. I could potentially lose the scholarship If I get laid off, need to take a leave of absence which would happen in the event of an injury/illness or pregnancy (not trying or want one yet but yet you never know), or not pass my classes. This money goes directly to the school.


My other scholarship was awarded from the school for $22,000 from a large grant that they received which I applied/interviewed for and recently found I that I won. There was no stipulation in the application only that it is intended for tuition and educational expenses including room and board. 


Tuition and fees alone will be about 24,789 this year and 16,300 next year. Not including whatever fees they want to randomly tax on in the next 2 years


I haven't received any of the funds yet so I don't know how and when either will actually be disbursed. 


So what should I do with the loans? Should I just pay back the entire amount when I graduate? Obviously, I wouldn't do that now incase something happens an I am no longer able to work. 


My undergraduate was paid for entirely by my parents. I live alone. I rent my apartment and my only other debt is 6,000 left on my car to be paid off by next year.

I need help with calculating what I am trying to do. I have several student loans and I have been doing research on Snowball vs Avalance debt payoffs. I have run the numbers for both scenarios for me and they are very similar so I have decided to payoff my loans by using the snowball method (plus I am a fan of instant gratification and would feel better paying off my smaller loans first).

I generally get around $3600 in tax refund each year and I am wanting to put that in a large lump payment each year towards my next lowest loan. Then I would take the $/month that I would save from paying off those loans and still throw it at the next lowest loan. My minimum monthly payments are $757.87, so I would continue to pay this amount each month in addition to the lump payment of $3600 each year.

My loans are as followed:
* AES (2 loans w/ separate APR):
* AES 1: $20,247.67, $136.01/month, 3.66%
* AES 2: $25,465.10, $177.53/month, 4.16%
* Sallie Mae: $8,928.98, $107.08/month, 8.25%
* Great Lakes: $12,026.75, $171.13/month, 3.53%
* Federal (8 loans w/ separate APR):
* FED 1: $1,747.40, $13.03/month, 4.5%
* FED 2: $1,945.75, $17.04/month, 6.8%
* FED 3: $4,390.09, $34.31/month, 5.6%
* FED 4: $2,171.82, $19.02/month, 6.8%
* FED 5: $4,269.05, $37.40/month, 6.8%
* FED 6: $3,442.84, $29.12/month, 6%

finance,Question about a college debt in collections,"Hello reddit.  I need some advice regarding some unpaid school debt.  I was a college student in a professional degree program at a major east coast university in 2010.  I became a victim of the downturn and couldn't pay for the last year of my college.  My father was gracious and paid for half of my tuition allowing me to continue to the 2nd semester and (graduate).  I still owe approximately $2000 to the university in order to obtain my transcripts for something I am trying to do today.  It is in collections, as I have been very very broke the last 3-4 years. (note: i have paid every month on time my federal and private student loan payments while unemployed or underemployed total $750/mo.)  Things have been better recently, but to keep up with many of my more important debts, i have let this one go to the back burner.  It has all caused me a significant amount of anxiety up until last year when i finally landed a job in my field that pays ok.  I called the university and spoke with a collections specialist.  They told me the amount was around 2k, and i couldn't do ANYTHING until i called the collection agency.  They even said they couldn't accept the money as I guess they sold the debt to the agency?  All i want is my transcripts, i don't have the cash on hand, as i live paycheck to paycheck ... I know they can't be aggressive with me so i was good at avoiding the calls the last 6 months.  NOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.  I have some confidence, I have a few hundred saved from the last few months from some smaller debts being taken care of, and I have a family member offering to help with the amount if i have exhausted all ways of getting the total.  My issue is i won’t be able to get the full amount, and I have some collections related questions.
Note: I apologize, but being so broke for so long, i did not learn much about my credit.  I don't know what my score is.

personalfinance,QUESTION ABOUT COLLEGE DEBT IN COLLECTIONS (USA),"Hello reddit.  I need some advice regarding some unpaid school debt.  I was a college student in a professional degree program at a major east coast university in 2010.  I became a victim of the downturn and couldn't pay for the last year of my college.  My father was gracious and paid for half of my tuition allowing me to continue to the 2nd semester and (graduate).  I still owe approximately $2000 to the university in order to obtain my transcripts for something I am trying to do today.  It is in collections, as I have been very very broke the last 3-4 years. (note: i have paid every month on time my federal and private student loan payments while unemployed or underemployed total $750/mo.)  Things have been better recently, but to keep up with many of my more important debts, i have let this one go to the back burner.  It has all caused me a significant amount of anxiety up until last year when i finally landed a job in my field that pays ok.  I called the university and spoke with a collections specialist.  They told me the amount was around 2k, and i couldn't do ANYTHING until i called the collection agency.  They even said they couldn't accept the money as I guess they sold the debt to the agency?  All i want is my transcripts, i don't have the cash on hand, as i live paycheck to paycheck ... I know they can't be aggressive with me so i was good at avoiding the calls the last 6 months.  NOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.  I have some confidence, I have a few hundred saved from the last few months from some smaller debts being taken care of, and I have a family member offering to help with the amount if i have exhausted all ways of getting the total.  My issue is i won’t be able to get the full amount, and I have some collections related questions.
Note: I apologize, but being so broke for so long, i did not learn much about my credit.  I don't know what my score is.  I currently have 2 checking accounts and 1 bank credit card tied to my checking.  I own no property and i own my 2006 Hyundai car.  I always figured i couldn't ever own anything so i set my life up to live like that :(

2)what should i be prepared with when i call the agency to deal with this collection?

personalfinance,Engaged 28 year old with lots of debt - Help me PF!,"Good afternoon PF, I recently proposed and am desperately needing to get my finances in order as I don't want it to effect her.  We've been living at my father's for a little while and will be there until the end of the year when we plan on buying a home.  He is not charging us anything (very fortunate and thankful for that).  She is the bread winner of the relationship and is much more financially secure than I am.  The house will be under her name as she has great credit and mine is still high 600's but falling quick.

While I want to stay at my father's for longer so I can tackle my credit cards it's not going to happen.  She wants us to have our own space and we can afford it.  We've been saving up and have enough for a down payment but I still have a ton of debt.  Unfortunately, using our savings for the down payment to pay of debt is not an option.  I've been using the snowball method and have been making some progress but not nearly as much as I should be living for free (partly due to having so many different payments and also trying to save - I am not a smart man).  I used to have terrible spending habits but have it under control now and am paying for my stupidity.



**So... Breakdown of my finances:**



I average around $1,200 per paycheck, paid twice a month.



*Personal Loan - $14,000 ($410/month at around 10% interest.  Consolidated old credit card debt at lower interest rate)

*Student Loan 1 - $35,000 ($257/month at 3% interest)

*Student Loan 2 - $800 ($50/month at 2% interest)

*Student Loan 3 - $4,500 ($50/month at 2% interest)


Here's where I really fucked up...  Went out and racked up more CC debt.



*CC 1 - $7275 ($200/month at 17% interest)

*CC 2 - $15,000 ($300/month at 18% interest)

*CC 3 - $800 ($200/month at 21.99%)


All are minimum payments except CC 3.  My only other expenses are listed below:



*Car insurance - $90/ month

*Storage unit - $85/month

*Gas - At least $300/month (I live way to far away from my current job and am seeking employment closer to home/where we'll be buying).

*Food - Varies but rarely eat out and usually spend around $20/week for breakfast and lunch.  Dinners provided by wife.



Not sure where I'm going wrong but I feel like I'm going backwards.  I always end up with zero extra cash and end up having to buy gas on my credit card.  I recently started a second job that will help, pay is decent but getting the hours I need isn't very reliable.  Just a convenient way to get some extra cash.

Any criticism, advice, whatever is greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,"24 years old - mortgage, car loan, credit cards. Help me sort things out?","I'm posting this from an alt account so I don't put too much personal financial information on the same account that has all of my other info!

First, a short explanation. Skip below if you don't care and only want to see what accounts I have where.

- - -

I bought a house in July of 2013 for $68,000 and did the minimum down payment. Due to this, they added a ""mortgage insurance"" onto my monthly payment - so it's higher than I think it should be ($450), but includes escrow for taxes and insurance also. Each payment only takes the principal down by less than $100.

I have a bank-issued credit card that I've had since I was 18. I had a $1,000 limit for the longest time, and after I got the house, they bumped it up to $9,000. I put larger purchases that I can't immediately afford on this card. INCREDIBLE interest rate.

I signed up for a ""rewards"" credit card for my daily purchases, so I get points back when I buy stuff like gas and food, and I'm better protected than with a debit card (chargebacks, etc). Initial credit $800, currently $1,500. I pay around $300-400 per paycheck on this card, because I'm always spending on it, and it always seems to stay between $900-1,400 balance.

In October 2013, I applied for Apple's financing card to get a new macbook pro for work. I was approved for the $2700 I needed for it, with 18 months 0% financing, and completely paid it off within 10 months. They have since bumped my credit line up to $4,200. $0 balance.

I sold my old car for $7,000 and bought a newer car for $10,000 around 6 months ago, taking out a $3,000 car loan. I've paid back around a thousand of it.

Up to that point, my credit score was 759, and I felt like I had a good grip on stuff. THEN, I co-signed on a $18,000 car loan for my girlfriend because she did not qualify with her credit. Now my credit score is 680. However, she recently started working a job that pays even better than mine, so I'm having her write me a check each time she gets paid for a quarter of the estimated monthly bills, so that she's essentially paying half of the bills each month. This JUST started, so I should have some extra money in the future.

- - -

Here are my current accounts:

* Mortgage on a home purchased for $68,000. Current balance $65,500. 

* Car loan on a car worth $9,500. Approximately balance of $2,200. 10% APR.

* Bank-issued credit card... $9,000 total credit, balance of $6,600. 3.25% APR.

* Second credit card. $1,500 total credit, $1,200 balance. 24% APR.

* Third credit card. $4,200 total credit, $0 balance.

* 401k I just started. Something like $200 in it.

* Checking account for receiving my direct deposits, not much else. No savings account.

- - -

I'd like to get out from under this debt. I ASSUME my best course of action would be to stop using the ""second credit card"" for my daily expenses, and instead use cash in my checking account, and pay that card off first, since it has a high APR. I assume next I would tackle paying off my car loan, since it has the next highest APR, then work on the largest credit card last, since it has the lowest interest rate (while still making minimum payments on all of them, of course).

The plan is the re-negotiate the girlfriend's car loan in solely her name in a year or two once she can do it with her own credit.

Does that sound right?

Edit: Or should I look into what rate the bank-issued credit card has for balance transfers? That way I could immediately get rid of my ""second credit card"" high interest rate.

Edit 2: I just checked, and for my 3.25% APR card, balance transfers are treated as purchases (3.25%), and not cash advances (11.5%), and the only fee is a one-time 3% fee. So I can transfer all of my balance from my 24% APR card to the 3.25% APR card for around $30, and then that card will be at $0, and I'll just owe all of my credit card debt in one lump at 3.25%!",finance,1408577554
personalfinance,"Capital One, my first credit card and unending shame...","This may get long, but please read, I really need your advice.

Once upon a time I was a stupid teenager who had no concept of how the world really works. I got my first credit card, a Capital One Platinum card with a $300 limit, in 2008. Sounds harmless enough, right?
Well, one month, after charging about $90 worth of stuff, 19 year old me decided to not pay the bill. It quickly reached limit, and then the interest continued to accrue. I then physically lost the card. Of course, I had no idea what was going on and didn't really think about it, as I was no longer living at the address they were sending the bills to. I was at college, and didn't have a pot to piss in, let alone the money to clean up what I messed up anyway. After college, moved around a lot. You get the idea. I never paid it. I really wish I had, but I didn't. 

A lot of things happened between then and now, and I am now a pretty responsible adult with a decent paying corporate job. I have an Experian membership as a way to monitor and try to repair my credit... I have cleaned up all the other negative items I collected living an irresponsible, transient lifestyle, but Capital One is the sticking point.

So, my Experian: Under ""Bankruptcy &amp; Judgments"" section, there is a judgment against me in NJ with the Special Civil part, plaintiff Capital One in the amount of $800-some-odd. 

Under the ""Credit Cards, Loans &amp; Other Debt"" part, Capital One is listed again as:
Account Name	CAP ONE		
Account #	XXXXXXXXXXXX		
Account Type	Credit Card		
Balance	$1,027.00		
Date Opened	8/1/2008		
Account Status	Closed		
Mo. Payment	-
Past Due	$1,027.00		
Payment Status	Charge-off		
High Balance	-		
Limit	$300.00		
Terms	Revolving		
Comments	Credit line closed-grantor request-reported by subscriber

And it is Posting a KD + collecting interest every month, killing my credit no matter how many other things I have gotten rid of or how many healthy accounts in good standing I have.

I had heard that settling with the original creditor is the best route, and have successfully been able to do just that with one or two others who were kind enough to even delete the listing afterward (pay-for-delete/goodguy discount kinda deal). It was amazing. My score improved and I really felt like I was getting somewhere.

But when I called Capital One, explained the situation, and asked if I can please settle the debt, no dice. Their customer service is awful, and they either tell me that they have no record of my account or otherwise cannot help me. The first two, I figured, ""Oh well, they must be new, I'll try another day and get someone else."" 

After this happened a few more times, I really lost my cool. I finally got so fed up that I yelled at an agent, ""Well, how can that possibly be, WHEN YOU ARE STILL POSTING TO MY CREDIT REPORT AND ****ING ME EVERY MONTH?! "" Sooo, I don't really want to call them anymore. But, I DO want to get rid of this as soon as possible. Please tell me:

- Should I bother to keep trying to chase down the original creditor (Cap One)? &amp; Why?

- If I paid the amount to the Special Civil part, would the ""closed"" account still reporting KD's stop?

- Is that even legal? How does a closed account that was charged off and then sued for, ending in a judgment, continue to collect interest? Seems really shitty.

- Have any relevant stories or advice? Please tell me how you fixed your situation?

Grateful to you for reading!

(9/2 EDIT)
Update: So after taking the advice in the comments here, I got on with it! 

Was able to visit the court in person, and get a copy of the judgment. I then tried to contact the law firm that litigated the case according to those papers, but they had long since gone out of business... was discouraging, but I kept looking. 

I found out they had split their accounts, and after writing to each firm, finally got a call back... spoke with the company they passed off their accounts to, and arranged a settlement with them! Long story short, went there and paid them, got a receipt, and just today I received written notice (also sent to the court) that the file is officially closed. 

I had the joy of writing to the credit bureaus today (to make sure the judgment gets updated to satisfied and the KD's stop) and have you guys to thank for sending me on the right track!

personalfinance,Help me calculate snowball method w/ paying lump payment once a year,"I tried posting this a few hours ago and I can't see it on the message board so I don't think it actually posted.

I created this account so I can ask you for your advice. This is my first post.
I need help with calculating what I am trying to do. I have several student loans and I have been doing research on Snowball vs Avalance debt payoffs. I have run the numbers for both scenarios for me and they are very similar so I have decided to payoff my loans by using the snowball method (plus I am a fan of instant gratification and would feel better paying off my smaller loans first).

I generally get around $3600 in tax refund each year and I am wanting to put that in a large lump payment each year towards my next lowest loan. Then I would take the $/month that I would save from paying off those loans and still throw it at the next lowest loan. My minimum monthly payments are $757.87, so I would continue to pay this amount each month in addition to the lump payment of $3600 each year.

My loans are as followed: 

AES (2 loans w/ separate APR): 

* AES 1: $20,247.67, $136.01/month, 3.66% 

* AES 2: $25,465.10, $177.53/month, 4.16% 

* Sallie Mae: $8,928.98, $107.08/month, 8.25% 

* Great Lakes: $12,026.75, $171.13/month, 3.53% 

Federal (8 loans w/ separate APR): 

* FED 1: $1,747.40, $13.03/month, 4.5% 

* FED 2: $1,945.75, $17.04/month, 6.8% 

* FED 3: $4,390.09, $34.31/month, 5.6% 

* FED 4: $2,171.82, $19.02/month, 6.8% 

* FED 5: $4,269.05, $37.40/month, 6.8% 

* FED 6: $3,442.84, $29.12/month, 6% 

* FED 7: $1,148.04, $9.70/month, 6% 

* FED 8: $742.59, $6.50/month, 6.8%

I don't want this to turn into a thread about: ""You should try to consolidate your loans."" ""You should try to lower your interest rates."" ""Why did you get so many loans?"" I simply want help calculating when I would be able to have all of my loans paid off. Every calculator I have found online does not allow you to include a lump payment. I have tried unbury.me, unbury.us, and payoff.io.

personalfinance,Will having a cosigner get us a lower APR on a car loan? And other questions [MA],"I think I remember reading that car loans are really discouraged in general, but we're stuck in a rut. 

My husband has an '00 Buick Century that is having transmission issues. We *just* put $1,000 into this car 3 months ago, which was a mistake, but at the time we hoped that the car would last until next spring when all of our credit card debt is paid off.

Thanks to the advice of this subreddit, we started to build an emergency fund last month, but we only have $1k in it. I'm not willing to replace the transmission in his current car, and because of the rut we are stuck in, we can't really buy a car with cash. He has to drive for work, so we really need something reliable, and are looking at lower mileage cars in the 10k range.

Here's my dilemma: 
I can get another 1.5k to put towards this from my paycheck on Friday. This gives us a downpayment of 2.5k towards the car. The thing of it is, he's new credit, and his score is in the low 600s. I made some mistakes in the past, and my credit score is climbing quickly and steadily, but it's still sub-650. 

We are still carrying substantial credit card balances- around 10k- which is way better than the 15k it was two months ago. I was putting $500 a check direct deposit into savings, and using $900 a check for credit card debt, just to get the credit cards over 20% interest paid off ASAP (probably another mistake), and also used a large payment I got to get rid of the really high interest stuff.

Since my income is pretty much ""disposable"" (IE, for debt/savings), a $200/month car payment plus a small increase in insurance won't kill us. 
But with that being said, I can't/won't take on another high interest loan.

So that leads me to my question: His parents are willing to cosign on a car for us, and they have pristine credit. I had to have a cosigner when I bought my car 5 years ago, never missed a payment, and we make all of our payments on time, so they trust us enough to have made the very generous offer. But will that help lower our interest rate?

My credit union says it doesn't matter, so I'm not sure if this varies based on lending institutions or not. 

The other question I have is whether or not anyone has any good general advice for us, about buying a car or anything else I spoke about in my post. I really don't want to make the same mistake twice, and the idea of getting a car for an interest rate of anything more than 3-4% really doesn't seem acceptable to me at this point in time, but I'm not sure what else to do. Another 1k or 2k beater just isn't going to work anymore since he is so dependent on his car- and I also drive a ton for work, so we can't exactly share mine.

My dad and I have near identical names. Such as, his is Jim Q Redditor and mine is Jimithy XW Redditor. We can both go by Jim or Jimithy and without our middle initials our names are basically the same. 

My mother and father declared personal and business bankruptcy in 2010. They lost everything. They were evicted from their home, lost cars, etc. There were many civil judgements against them (none criminal). 

Starting about 2011 I noticed that on my credit report there was a report of unpaid taxes (I can't fully remember the official term) which was my fathers. I disputed it and got it removed (the credit bureaus had to go to the county courthouse to verify). 

Then, around six months ago, I tried to get an apartment. They ran a background check and told me I had been evicted (again, my father) and hence they wouldn't rent to me. After dealing for 4 weeks with Experian's background check service ""Credit Retriever"" they agreed it was an error and sent a letter to the apartment complex. 

These instances keep ""popping up"". I just did a balance transfer on a chase visa (whoo hop no interest for 18 months on a very small amount of debt!) and had no issue. 

I am so finished being accused of the ""sins of the father"". Each time its happened its upended my life for a period of a month to several. 

I'm starting to look for jobs now fresh out of a master's degree program and I really don't want something from my dad's financial disaster to prevent me from getting the position i want (I will be applying to federal positions and global NGOs etc). On my own, without my dad's crap, I have a 720 credit score. 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to make sure my dad's credit history and mine aren't intertwined? I've pulled all three credit reports and nothing from his on there. I'm really unsure how I was lumped in with his eviction on the background check and thats what really bothers me as there is no way I know of I can do a rental background check on myself. 

Would an attorney be able to help in anyway? Or will I forever have to deal with this on an incident by incident basis?

personalfinance,Is this the proper net pay for me in NYC?,"Apologies in advance if this isn't the right place to post. If you know of a more suitable place, please let me know.

I'm having a hard time stomaching that more than 30% of my pay goes towards taxes and programs. I am a teacher and my salary is currently $54,372. My take home pay bi-monthly is roughly $1,220. I once saw a post concerning another NYC teacher (who is single with no dependents) with a salary of about $51,000, taking home a little over $1,350 net bi-monthly. Both of us have almost the same deductions, with the exception of my school fee.

Here is a sample breakdown of my check:
Gross: 2265
Net:  1226
Total deductions: 1039

FICA tax	136.99-
MDICARE	32.04-

Union Fee	50.73-
Commute	56.00-
School	170.45-

If my school fee weren't there, I think my take home would be about $1350 (being generous, I only deducted 25% of the school fee), which is the same amount as the teacher I pointed out above, even though my salary is slightly higher. It just really bums me out that my take home pay is so paltry in an area with such a high cost of living. For others who happen to live and work in NYC, or teachers who live and work in NYC, is this what your pay looks like as well (exorbitant deductions out the woozah?) Why does my pay look different than the pay of the teacher's that I described above if all the deductions are practically the same?

personalfinance,Requesting advice on lowering monthly home payments,"Hi Everyone,


My grandmother has crippling monthly payments on her home in NYC and I was hoping you guys could recommend the best course of action.

Her current bill is $2066/mo, with ~$1,050 going towards her mortgage payment, and ~$1k going to homeowners insurance and property taxes (combined). So, tackling each of these payments separately:


**Mortgage**

Her interest rate is 6.75%, which is a high rate for today’s markets and she should be able to get a loan at a lower APR. My understanding is that her options are refinancing or getting a home equity loan.

I don’t have her full financial data, but she has a good credit score, and when I called Capital One, they said she could likely get a fixed-rate APR between 3.75% and 4.25%, with no closing costs (because of their current promotion that gives $1,000 discount on closing costs) and no prepayment penalty.

My plan is to call several other financial institutions and look at fixed-rate and Hybrid ARM (adjustable rate mortgage), since she’ll be able to pay it off within the ‘fixed’ timeframe, and choose the one that will minimize the total interest and fees (closing cost, prepayment penalty).

**Insurance**

The combined total of her tax and insurance is ~$1000/month, with about $200 of it going as escrow for taxes. I plan on reviewing her policy and seeing if there are significantly cheaper policies that offer similar coverage. I haven't looked into this yet.


**Summary**

* Remaining principal is ~$30,000
* Current APR is 6.75%
* Mortgage payment is $1,066/mo (principal is 885, interest is 167)
* Remaining months: 32 (calculated)
* Property value is roughly $850,000
* Located in NYC

My plan is to find the loan that lowers the total expenditures and preferably stretches the loan over a longer time period. This will likely require no closing fees and no prepayment penalties.

Any advice or recommendations? I’m very new to the finance side and all input is welcome.

Note that I plan on having someone better-qualified look over all the paperwork and that I won’t be signing anything or accepting any liability - my position in this is purely advisory.

personalfinance,Holding off on paying student loan interest until the grace period ends; good or bad idea?,"My unsubsidized federal student loans accrued a total of $1200 in interest while in school and go into repayment in February 2015 (they’re currently in the 6 month grace period). Rather than pay off that interest now (which I am capable of), would it make sense to hold off on paying the interest until JUST BEFORE the grace period ends and they go into repayment? 

If I understand student loan interest correctly, it does not compound like credit card interest, so the interest does not capitalize until the grace period officially ends in February. This should mean that between now and then the amount of interest that accrues per month will be the same regardless of whether or not I pay off the interest now or wait until then (assuming I do not put any money towards the principle). 

The idea is that until the grace period ends I’ll be saving up a 6 month emergency fund and a week or so before they go into repayment I’ll pay off the entire $1200 plus all the interest that will have accrued between now and then to avoid having the interest added to the total amount of the loan.

personalfinance,Marriage and Student Debt,"Hi all,

I'm looking for information about how student debt works when you get married. I read the FAQ and didn't see anything specifically addressing this. Here is my situation:

Me and my SO are currently very serious. She is still on her mother's health insurance, but is turning 26 in early 2015. Her current employer wants to know whether she will be joing their health insurance plan next year.

I currently make a lot more than her (100k+). I have about 60k in various retirement accounts, 30k in non-retirment mutual funds, and about 15k in cash. I also have no debt due to a combination of hard work and my incredibly generous parents.

My SO makes about 42k a year. She has about 130k in student loans/other debt. Her after tax paycheck is currently about $630 weekly. We are trying to put about $300 of that a week towards her debt. Starting in January her minimum payments will be almost $1000 a month anyway.

I am **not** looking for advice on how to pay it all down, I am aware of the strategies.

I am **not** looking for advice about student loans. It is mostly private debt and so the nice options you get from government loans do not apply.

I am **not** looking for a lecture about not getting into this much debt in the first place. It happened and now we have to deal with it.

ANYWAY.

That is the current financial situation. As I said, the problem is her health insurance. Her employer's plans are pretty terrible and expensive, with the nicest taking about 125 bucks a week from her paycheck to the worst which is 55 bucks a week. I don't even like any of them. The only upside is each year the employee contribution decreases and in year 6 you pay nothing.

Obviously, that really isn't much room for that sort of expensce when almost 50% of her pay is going towards debt.

Now, I plan on marrying this girl. I have no qualms going to the courthouse and just doing it sooner rather than later so I can put her on my health plan. Some day soon I will buy a ring and we'll have some sort of ceremony and stuff, but I am willing to just go do it tomorrow for insurance reasons.

Being prudent, my questions are:

1. Will they ever come after me if she can't make payment on her debt while we are married?
2. What happens if something we did not work out? Would her debt ever become my debt if we seperated? We would likely have a pre-nup because she understands my assets should be protected.
3. We file taxes seperately I am assuming?
4. What if we purchased a home together and she couldn't make payment? Would that be at risk? I assume it would be best to just keep it under my name?
5. Long shot, but is there ANY strategy for dealing with this much student debt? If I wasn't helping her out there is no way she could afford to even live. ~~In all seriousness, I am tempted to just tell her to stop paying and see what happens. In several years, even if they sue and successfully garnish her wages, there are definitely caps on that which are WAY lower than the almost 50% of her pay she is doing right now.~~ (Wasn't actually serious). Would talking to a lawyer help? Anything?

**EDIT:**

Breakdown:

* Other debt is about 6k of credit card debt which should have paid off by early next year. We throw everything leftover from the 300 dollars a week at this. It was mostly educational related expenses.
* Sallie Mae private loans (75k) has her in a forgiveness program for the student debt there . Her payments are currently $290 a month at a 2% interest rate (which gets re-assessed yearly). This will go up when/if she gets raises.
* Chase private loan of about 25k. Currently in forebearance until December. Payment will be about $280 a month and she has called and they will not work with her.
* Rest is Dept of Edu/Federal (about 30k). This is currently being consildated but by my estimates will be at around a 5.2% interest rate with a payment of about $380 a month. IBR will likely not make that any lower by my calculations.

We won't be able to refinance her private debt anytime soon due to her incrediby low credit score and because we do not want her mother cosigning anything anymore. I will not cosign either due to the amount of debt.
But remember, my real question is about the implications of all this when getting married.

**EDIT 2:**

I am asking this because SHE doesn't want me to be financially responsible for her and wants to be independent. I am looking for ways to make that possible. I am aware I will likely have to help out in the end but I don't care. We are getting married eventually and I was trying to understand what that meant when it came to her debt from before we met and the savings I have accumulated from before we met.

**I am NOT trying to get out of the responsibility of merging our finances.** The bottom line is if she lost her job, or got injured, or whatever, SHE doesn't want me responsible for her previous mistakes. She doesn't want it eating away into the savings I/we have that is meant for creating a life together.",finance,1408627644
technology,"Hi Reddit, this is Congresswoman Anna Eshoo and I am launching a contest on Reddit for you to rebrand net neutrality!","Dear Reddit Users,
 
Today I launched a [contest on Reddit to rebrand ‘net neutrality’] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0-yfZ3KxY&amp;feature=youtu.be)—the term used to describe the principle of all Internet traffic being created equal and that it should be treated as such.
 
In May, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed new Internet traffic rules under the guise of net neutrality. But if approved, the proposed plan could split the flow of online traffic into tiers by allowing priority treatment to big online corporations that pay higher fees to broadband providers. This would mean a fast lane for those who can afford it and a slow lane for everyone else, hindering small businesses, innovators and Internet users.
 
Internet users know what they want and expect from the Internet, but these days all the jargon about net neutrality rules is making it difficult to know what box to check that advances their best interest. So I’m hosting this contest to rebrand net neutrality and bring some clarity to an otherwise muddy legal debate before the FCC finalizes its proposed open Internet rules. If Internet users care about their right to uninhibited access to the Internet, this is their opportunity to have an impact on the process, to help put the advantage back in the hands of the Internet user, and to ensure that the free and open Internet prevails.
 
The contest is free to enter and the rules are simple. The most popular entry on this Reddit post will be declared the winner on September 8, 2014. Participants are reminded to refrain from using vulgar or otherwise inappropriate language. 
 
I hope you will participate and I thank you for it.

RepAnnaEshoo

**UPDATE (9/11/14):** Thank you all for participating. Launched August 21st, the contest drew a total of over 28,000 votes for 3,671 different entries and comments.

Of entries that were actual rebranding suggestions, the following are the three that received the most votes by the end of the contest:

1. Reddit user “PotentPortentPorter” had the most votes with their entry “Freedom Against Internet Restrictions.” (1,146 votes)

2. Reddit user “thelimitededition” had the second most votes with their entry “Freedom to Connect (F2C).” (607 votes)

3. Reddit user “trigatch4” had the third most votes with their entry “The Old McDonald Act: Equal Internet for Everyone Involved Online (EIEIO).” (547 votes)

In addition to casting votes for rebranding, there were approximately 5,000 votes from Reddit users in favor of what they believe is the best *policy approach* to achieve net neutrality. All 5,000 votes favored a reclassification of broadband providers as common carriers, specifically under Title II of the Communications Act.

personalfinance,"Thief steals my credit card number, Navy FCU saves the day","I'll put the TL;DR up front - Navy Federal stops fraud in real time, turns a ten year customer into a raving fan.

My first 'real' bank account was opened at Navy Federal Credit Union at the US Naval Academy when I was a plebe (freshman) back in 2001.  My whole $100 a month paycheck had to go somewhere, and it was set up as a matter of course during our indoctrination for Plebe Summer.  I literally didn't even open my statements and such for the 2 months of Plebe Summer, and I didn't realize I could even set up direct deposit anywhere else until my sophomore ('youngster') year.  In my time on active duty, I used Navy Federal and USAA because they both filled in the gaps for the other - USAA was better at telebanking and had some nice features (and insurance and not terrible investing), but Navy Federal had physical branches everywhere I was stationed.  Even after I got out the military, my jobs always ended up being nearby major military bases, so I kept both and never even investigated any other options.  They treated me well, and I did well by them.

Yesterday, I took my wife out for a nice dinner, and was sort of miffed when my credit card got declined.  I use a Navy Federal card that I've had (in different iterations) literally since my sophomore year, and I get reward points, so I use it for all of my purchases and pay it off monthly.  It seemed strange but I don't make a fuss about such things, and used another card to pay for dinner.

I now know I could have called last night (the service number is 24 hours a day), but I didn't even try to call until this morning.  What the representative told me, though, was kind of shocking - the reason my card was locked was because a $200 charge had been attempted in a city that I *used to work in* at a retailer that I shopped at regularly when I was there.  There had been 2 other (declined) attempts to use my card yesterday, along with my declined attempt at dinner.  The representative (Darla!) was very helpful - I'll have a new card by tomorrow.

I've jumped through all the hoops - I checked every card and/or account in my name, ran a credit report, and so far, it looks like this is an isolated incident.  The fact that it's in an area that I used to live makes me think that someone must have found something in the trash, at some point, but honestly, even after Navy FCU completes their investigation, I may never know.

Part of me knows that **any** big financial company probably would have frozen that transaction; I doubt that Navy Federal has any proprietary fraud detection software that any other bank wouldn't have access to, as well.  But I am genuinely impressed that Navy FCU was able to suss out that it was an unusual transaction, even though I regularly (2-3 times a year) travel back to that area, and decline the transaction before the fraud even got started.  Never, not once in my whole time using them as a bank, even when I used my credit card overseas, have I had a transaction flagged - but when it counted, they caught it before any damage could be done.  

Full disclosure - I work for a wirehouse brokerage firm/bulge bracket bank and carry several licenses, but I do not (and have never) worked for Navy Federal.  After this, I'm kind of wondering whether I ought to.",finance,1408637992

I am nearing retirement (~2 years) and I've always been the guy who socked stuff away into my retirement accounts and then stuffed the statements in a drawer and my head in the sand. Better than not saving, I suppose, but now I think I need to get a better handle on how retirement actually works. 

MOST of my accounts are with TIAA-CREF. And TIL the difference between Retirement Annuity, Group Retirement Annuity, and 403b. But I'm still confused, about these things, so question one is whether anyone has good pointers to help me understand these things. (One of my accounts says ""403b RA"" which completely contradicts what I think I know about 403bs!). Then I have one account at Vanguard that just is called ""Retirement Income Plan for Teaching Faculty at $myuniversity"" and everything in it is in a date-targeted retirement mutual fund. (It only accounts for about 10% of my total retirement accounts.) 

Having lurked here for a while as well as at /r/financialindependence, I thought it would be a good idea to roll everything over into an IRA so I could manage it myself, assuming I can learn enough to do that. 

However, it seems that you can't do that with the RAs and GRAs, at least not easily and not quickly. 

I was excited to roll everything to Vanguard because I'd be whatever is their fancy million plus category, but if I can't roll everything there, I won't be, so perhaps it makes sense to close out the Vanguard account and put all my eggs in the TIAA-CREF basket. 

Any thoughts on whether I can make TIAA-CREF work for me as well as other folks make Vanguard? 

Any pointers to RA, GRA, 403b knowledge? The FAQ says I should indicate asset allocation, but I can't seem to understand it for the TIAA-CREF accounts. Instead of giving me a mutual fund name like the Vanguard account, it says things like ""Guaranteed 38%/ Equities	58%/ Fixed Income	5%"" (An example from one of the accounts.) So I find I have actually no idea HOW it's invested!

I have a meeting with a TIAA-CREF advisor next week, and ideally I'd like to go into the meeting not sounding and feeling like a total moron who hasn't looked at their retirement income in 40 years, which is accurate, but I'd still rather not look and sound that way.

It might also be worth mentioning that my auto loan has a ridiculous interest rate because my dad co-signed, and he has awful credit. Do I look into refinancing now that I have a viable salary for a single person without kids? 

I grew up with highly impulsive and financially irresponsible parents, and never learned how to budget and save. Reddit, where do I start? What do I pay off first? What should I focus on chipping away debt?

My last question regards my living situation. My boyfriend and I currently split everything right down the middle. He makes 1000 even a month, but doesn't have any debt of any kind (generous parents). Is it wise to begin to pay 2/3 of the expenses because I will be making 2/3 of our joint monthly income?

At my job, which is retail, I make around 40-50k a year (commissions). We have a 401k program through Vanguard in which the company will match 50% up to 3% total of the grossed amount. With this we can also use Vanguard for a Roth with no fees.

My Situation:
I put 6% into the 401k to get the maxed amount matched. I do have it mixed well within it also between stocks, bonds, etc. The plan is to start putting 4% into their Roth but I get hesitant for some reason. I bank with a credit union (CACU), but my interest rates are getting slammed by natural rates of inflation, so I've been trying to research online banking. I'm thinking that if I move with Schwab, I can get a Roth with no fees by having a high interest checking account. I average about 1000-1200 a paycheck, but saving for a rainy day seems to be impossible as I find myself almost, if not completely empty by the next check. I split rent making my rent 337, I have a couple of credit cards totalling $1000 that I keep running myself into maxing out. My car payment is only $240 a month, and I don't have a ton of other outside expenses other than my dog. I'm more looking for advice to get my credit built, and allocate my funds the best for long-term savings.

 Bitcoin
Can it replace the Dollar?        Why should we care?
•	The Federal Reserve is not a “Federal” institution, it’s a private bank.  These few people control trillions of dollars and they create the financial problems we are dealing with today. Before the FED we had honest money and a prosperous country. Now with the fed we are in debit several hundred percent of our annual GDP.  We have been made slaves by these bankers and it’s time to take the power back. 
•	Bitcoin replaces the “trusted third party” in a transaction between two people.  Rather than trusting a bank, you are trusting the bitcoin computer protocol.  The bitcoin network will provide the trust, so you can cut out the bank and not have to pay fees.  If you send money out of the country it can cost 10% or more.  Bitcoin is so cheap it’s almost free. Fees are as low as .02 of 1 percent. 
•	You can send 1 cent or 1 million dollars in just a few seconds anywhere in the world. No one can stop you from sending money, you could use a telegraph, a ham radio, or even a common book to communicate the private key of your bitcoins and transfer the money without a computer. 
•	The bitcoin network is distributed, so one computer crashing or even 99.9% of computers crashing would not wipe our your holdings as long as you have the numeric key. 
•	Ultimate portability, your bitcoins are stored on every node in the systems. Millions of computers have your balance recorded. You don’t have to move your bitcoins, they are always on the network waiting for you.  You fly to another country and they are there, and the balances are anonymous, no names are on the network, no SSN or identity information
•	You can print your own paper bitcoins and trade them for goods. 
•	You can even store your bitcoins in your head by memory 
•	The number of bitcoins is limited and bitcoin is set up mathematically in such a way that it should gain value over time, unlike the dollar that is always loosing purchasing power. 
•	Bitcoin rewards saving, the dollar rewards spending and over consumption.  
•	The fees banks charge or just the tip of the ice burg, The remittance business is billions of dollar a year that could go back to the people, but bitcoin is not just to save remittance fees, bitcoin is a way to cut the banks out completely and replace this dishonest system of debit with a honest money system. 
•	Governments can’t freeze your assets or lock them within borders.  This is our money, by the people and for the people.  The only person who controls the money is you. 
•	Most of all bitcoin takes the power of economic manipulation away from these very few powerful bankers.  Bitcoin is a way to take the power back, so we the people can decide our own fate. The free market will always provide a solution, and price discovery, let the markets free!!  
Ignorance is the weapon of choice for those who intend to enslave us.

They want to keep you from understanding that money is the foundation of the economy, the economy is the foundation of our nation, and we can’t have an honest economy or an honest nation without honest money.

personalfinance,Question regarding upside-down car loan.,"Hello Reddit,

I'm severely upside down in my car loan.  I can continue paying, but I'm getting really tired of it and I've managed to save some money to hopefully leverage myself out of this crummy situation. 

I have a 2012 Chevy Cruze with 40k miles on it.  I owe nearly $19,000 due to negative equity I had in my previous vehicle.  Based on options and the NADA website, I can expect anywhere from $10,250 to $12,225k on a trade in. To sell it on my own I could get up to $15,000. I pay nearly $500 a month for this car based on that negative equity, little money down, and having a crap interest rate.

I have $8,000 in cash.

I'm curious if it would be wise to see about trading the car in and using some of the cash as a down payment on something really, really cheap.  My ultimate goal is to not have any more car payments. For example, a dealer a friend works at has a 2004 Dodge Intrepid I could buy for $3,500.  My father-in-law can help me fix this car, as he did with my previous Dodge Intrepid before I got into this mess, so I'm not very much concerned with what condition anything else I get into at this point is because my main goal is getting rid of my Cruze.

I've also considered voluntary repossession, and using some of the $8,000k to buy a beater car.  I don't drive to work anymore, and when I do need to go somewhere my wife and I can manage to share our other vehicle.

I know that I'm preparing to eat a giant shit sandwich, I guess what I'm asking is which corner do I bite off first!? 

Any help and advice is appreciated.  Thanks!",finance,1408664472

Help?","Using a throwaway here, because right now I'm a person, not just some random internet comments.  As the name suggests, I suck at money.  My wife's not much better.  Neither of us likes this situation, but also, neither of us is willing to dedicate all of our spare time to becoming CPA's just to juggle everything.  We're entitled like that.  If that offends, feel free to take this opportunity to be offended.

Mrs. Sucksatmoney brings home $330 every week.  I bring home $980 every two weeks.  I get a partial reimbursement from work for my cell phone (I'm on-call every third week), for $40, and we include her parents' cell phone on our bill, for which they pay us $55 (both monthly).

For the basics, each month we owe $600 in rent, $63 for water, $330 for electricity (this includes payments against a past-due balance of about $2,600), $26 for trash removal, $51 for the borough to take my shit, $64 for car insurance, $225 for the cell phones, and $86 for internet.

We've got three student loan bills we've been keeping up on, all private loans for my (failed) education, all with my family members co-signing, amounting to $331/month.  I've got a short stack of federal loans I haven't been keeping up on amounting to $283/month, and she's got a short stack of federal loans in deferment.  The loans I'm paying on carry a balance of 

We've got three credit card bills which have been handed to collections, of which I've set up automatic monthly payments on one, amounting to $36.94 (against a current balance of $849).  The other two carry a total balance of $2,900, and we haven't made arrangements with the collectors yet.

We have monthly medical expenses for personal issues totaling $70 (thanks, decent insurance), and outstanding medical bills which aren't yet being handled, totaling $1,195, most of which is currently in the hands of collectors, though about $100 is still outstanding with the doctor's office itself.

I've estimated our monthly food expenses at $350.  With a shared 35-mile commute, we end up around $250/mo. in gas.  We have pets we love who cost us around $60/month.  

For the past few months, we've been trying to stem the tide of reckless spending by assigning specific 'allowances' for each of us, and we've been pretty good about not hitting the 'general fund' for stupid crap.  The allowances are just shy of 10%, she takes $30 per week and I take $90 every two, totaling $300/month.

When I do the math, we don't look screwed.  How not-screwed are we?  What should we be prioritizing?  Are the allowances blindly stupid?  Is there a way to do this without trying to force ourselves into a lifestyle where we crack and drain the bank at the liquor store after three weeks?  What sort of long-term planning can and should we be doing at this point?

Thank you for your time.  I will greatly appreciate any and all feedback.

personalfinance,Understanding Structured Settlements,"Hopefully everyone is having a great weekend. Today I have the pleasure of co-hosting a $1000 giveaway! You may well have already seen posts from some other cohosts relating to Structured Settlements or selling annuity; if not, make sure you enter here!
What is a Structured Settlement?
When we hear the term structured settlement or ‘periodic payment’, the first thing that comes to mind is probably injury court cases; perhaps a win that results in a payout from an insurance company. Essentially, instead of winning damages as a lump sum, a more recent and popular outcome is to be awarded a structured settlement; a sum of money which is awarded in installments. This has a number of advantages for all parties involved. For the company/person paying the damages, they are not required to outlay all of the money immediately – the immediate outlay of capital could bankrupt or seriously affect their future business potential. For the recipient; there is less chance of being financially irresponsible and blowing all the cash!
Structured Settlement
Photo Credit: freedigitalphotos.net
 
When Structured Settlements Don’t Work
Like anything else, one solution does not fit all. While regular payments sound sensible and perhaps a better all-round solution, sometimes people need the capital immediately:
Paying for College – Depending on the time of the settlement, it could be advantageous to have a lump sum of money to help pay for your children’s university. This may prevent them taking out expensive student loans, or perhaps enable them to go when they wouldn’t otherwise.
Getting out of Debt - If you are in some serious debt, perhaps it would make sense to use the compensation to clear these immediately. Not only would it relieve your stress and worries, but it would free up a lot of your monthly income. Consequently, the extra money would have the same effect as the monthly structured settlement payment.
Paying off Your House – Using a lump sum payment to obliterate your mortgage gives the same result as paying off debt – it frees up money each month to spend on other things. In effect, you are replacing the monthly structured payment with a reduced mortgage / living cost and getting some peace of mind thrown in for free!
 
The Alternative
If one of the above scenarios applies to you, perhaps it is worth trading annuity payments for a lump sum. There are several companies who are willing to purchase your structured settlement and in return pay you an immediate lump sum. Obviously there are fees involved, but these can often be offset by high-interest rates that you would no longer be subjected to!",finance,1408695309

The BitLicense and whole way of thinking presented by a state government office composed of unelected officials trying to regulate international open source protocols - these things are dangerous.

BitLicense would turn Bitcoin into an ugly, slow, insider's game - precisely the things Bitcoin was made to escape from.

We need to win this one, because if the dishonesty behind BitLicense is allowed to win in New York, it will be allowed to win elsewhere.

We need to demand full records of who this state government agency's employees have dined with, had lunch with, and any official meetings with over the past 18 months. This regulatory language came from *somewhere*, and we need to find out where, as taxpayers and members of the public and prominent members of the tech community. It certainly did not come from us.

Secondarily, an open letter signed by leading BTCers and published in The New York Times and/or Wall Street Journal would help to improve the narrative here and bring the kind of actual ""balance"" this BitLicense seems to abhor.

To the extent allowed by law, I'll be giving the state/federal maximum to any opponent of Mr. Lawsky in the future, explicitly for this reason. If he thinks that destroying the beauty of Bitcoin will further his political aspirations in any way, he is incorrect. Others in a financial position to do so should explore this route as well.

We all know the BitLicense is absurd, unenforceable, and goes against much of American free enterprise thinking. (It also appears to interfere significantly with interstate commerce, and would have an obvious impact on the start-up careers market in NYC.)

This doesn't mean they won't move forward with it. A state that allows newly created agencies, composed of unelected officers, to regulate global open source technology is precisely the kind of state that won't mind looking tone deaf as it essentially outlaws Bitcoin for all but the biggest and slowest players.

We crush the BitLicense now, and Bitcoin's future is bright indeed.

Example: My boyfriend and I got a new apartment and had to pay the deposit with a cashier's check.

John Dow buys 1 bitcoin on 3-1 margin.  As a result he has the following in his trading account.

1 bitcoin bought with 200 cash

200 cash as reserve for losses

400 loan at 30% interest

Sally Mae lent her 1 bitcoin to OKCoin and received 20% interest

Sally is receiving 20% annually (600 * .20 = 60 /365 which is roughly .16cents a day).  

She still owns the coins.  *As a result, when she calls in(takes back the coin) she gets 1 bitcoin no matter what the value at the time.* 

Next day auditor does a **proof of reserves audit**.  They walk away saying bitcoins and bank deposits are sound.  OKCoin looks good they say.  

A week goes by bitcoin shoots up in 30 minutes to $3000 on news that Russia has decided it will not accept USD or Euro for Gas and Oil.  It will only accept Bitcoin, Gold, Silver, and Russian Ruble.  Sally calls in the loan.  She is happy now!  Forget .16 cents a day!  Well John Doe is forced to give her the coin back at $3000 price.  He is also happy!  He has made $2400 on his trade minus interest paid on loan!

**Now lets ask OKCoin where would the $2400 come from?** 

**Snapshot audits are useless when margin is allowed**




**UPDATE**

Snapshot audit of cash accounts and bitcoin accounts at BitStamp would be more appropriate because as far as I know they do not allow margin trading.",cryptocurrency,1408716833

personalfinance,Should I refinance auto-loan at higher loan amount to get check to pay off some credit card debt?,"Currently my auto loan is at $28000 at 6.9% and credit card debt is ~$8000 at 11-20% (multiple cards).  Monthly car payments are $665 and I pay $400/month on my credit cards.

I'm looking into refinancing my auto-loan now and have been offered  a 72 month loan at 4.24% of up to $34000 where I can take the extra money as a check to pay of credit card debt.  Monthly payment would be $546. Is it wise to accept the $34000 and pay off some of my credit card debt? Then use the money I would use to pay credit cards to add to my auto loan payment so I can pay off earlier? No pay off penalty. OR just take the $28000 loan at 4.24% for current auto loan?   Basically is it worth it to move ~$5000 of credit card debt to my auto loan at a lower interest rate? 


Edit: Thanks for all the feedback! I realized that no, it's not a good idea for me to refinance with a cash payout to reduce interest rates on credit card debt. I should just balance transfer to a 0% card and refinance my auto loan as normal at a lower rate.",finance,1408719208
personalfinance,Could my credit score be taking a hit because of a paid off student loan?,"It's pretty much all there in the title.

I woke up one morning and realized my savings surpassed an adequate emergency fund by enough to knock out one of my smaller student loans with the absolute highest interest rate. So, duh, I called Sallie Mae up and asked how to go about paying it off. They didn't give me any trouble whatsoever and gave me the information I needed to pay it off.

I guess I should talk about the loan. It was a private loan with an outstanding balance of about $3,000 with an 11.25% interest rate.

At any rate, that was in May.  I recently checked my credit score and discovered that it has been steadily sinking since then. I've had no lifestyle/spending habit changes at all but my credit score has taken a hit of 17 points since paying off the loan. I'm assuming this was some sort of penalty for paying it off early but I don't understand the mechanics behind how they would go about doing that and I'm positive I asked about any penalties before moving along with this.

Is this common? I guess I should have done more research before taking the plunge but I got too excited about knocking $100 off of my monthly payment and just did it.

Edit: Thanks everyone! Also, did I violate some condition of the board? I got like two automoderator replies telling me to visit the FAQ. I DID!",finance,1408719300

worldpolitics,US Foreign Policy Explained,"http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/08/us-foreign-policy-explained.html

It is very easy to understand current US Foreign Policy, providing you can get your head around some simple facts.

The US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and UK governments are all allies.

Their Foreign Policy is mutually beneficial.

Note - it is beneficial to the RULERS of those countries, not to the people who actually live in those countries. 

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NwPWbjuUOAg/U_d1GvjZjHI/AAAAAAAABA4/6wBmJZqPUUE/s1600/Saudi%2BArabia%2BKerry.jpg

Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States want to sell their oil and Natural Gas at a high price, preferably at around $100 a barrel. There is a glut of available oil at $100 a barrel. In order to keep the price of oil at about $100 a barrel the production and distribution of other countries oil has to be suppressed and limited.

The main countries currently being or recently targeted to reduce their supplies of oil are :-

Iran

Iraq

Russia

Libya

The main countries currently being targeted to limit the distribution of Natural Gas are :-

Syria

Ukraine

Note - these are all war zones. Russia and Iran are cold wars, while the others are hot.

Having a war in a country is a great way of limiting it's production of oil.

The interests of the US government are served by this policy by :-

Increasing US military spending

Increasing the profits of US arms companies

Increasing the profits of large US (and UK) oil companies

 Increasing the profits of large US (and UK) banks by supplying almost free money to them via the Federal Reserve. This can only continue if the US government continues to run extremely large deficits. The best way to have a large deficit is to spend money on war (or arms).

Keeping Americans (and Brits) scared of a foreign enemy in order to pass and maintain draconian laws for domestic political control (which are sold as counter terrorism measures). This tactic is as old as the hills.

The interests of the Israeli government are served by :-

Instability in the Middle East - keep the Arabs and the Middle East, fighting against themselves and not against Israel. N.B. this also serves the interests of the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states by distracting their domestic populations from the actions of their governments.

Keeping the flow of funds from the US to Israel.

Keeping the levels of hate and conflict high between Jews and Arabs high for domestic political control. The last thing the Likud Party wants is for any Peace to break out. The Likud and Netanyahu purely survive on maintaining a high level of hate and war in the Middle East.

In order to pursue these policies a primary requirement for all these countries is to recruit more Islamic Terrorists than are killed, to keep their domestic populations scared and blinded by hate.

Hence we have things like the US drone warfare program and the Israeli attack on Gaza very deliberately targeting and killing high numbers of civilians, including women and children, to stoke up Muslim anger around the world in order for the ranks of Islamic Terror groups to be expanded.

We have things like the creation and funding of ISIS by Saudi Arabia and the CIA with the express purpose of regime change in Syria.

We get things like the recent brutal and well publicized beheading of a US journalist by ISIS. There is nothing better than a bit of gratuitous barbarism to stoke up American anger against Muslims.

We have things like the war in Mali and Boku Haram in Nigeria. The oil producing countries in West Africa (like Nigeria or Algeria) are a likely future target for US engineered instability and more war.  

A further requirement, in order to pursue these policies, is a very heavily controlled and censored press and main media. Which is the case in all of these countries.

After all having a high oil price and lots of wars and terrorism is not in the interests of the people who live in any of these countries. If they actually realized the truth of what's going on they might get a bit upset.

 

This article appears to hit the nail on the head to explain the recent events in Syria, Iraq and the actions of ISIS. You won't see it published in the media of any of these countries.

personalfinance,Questions about vanguard investment accounts,"I've finally started to take charge of my long term financial health, but have a couple questions about the next step. 

Sadly my employer does not offer a 401k, but I have maxed out my IRA (Vanguard 2050 target) for the year. My emergency fund is intact, and my only debts are student loans of ~$6,000 @ 2.625%. I've made huge progress on my loans this year and the only remaining ones have this low interest rate. Rather than pay those off immediately, I'd like to invest some extra cash and hope for a better return. 

In looking at Vanguard investment accounts I notice that the minimum to open an account is $3,000, which must be placed in a money market before you can buy funds. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but am I okay to invest the full $3,000 as soon as it clears? Or do I have to keep a minimum balance in this account at all times?

My other question is about mutual funds vs. ETF's. I've only got the $3,000 to put towards this at the moment, so my options are a bit limited. If I went with total stock marked index fund I'd have to spend all of it to meet the minimum and be 100% in stocks. It seems given how much money I've got to play with I'd be better off going with ETF's. This way I could create a three fund portfolio. Seems like a pretty obvious choice to me. Does that sound about right? Then down the road is it worth changing to admiral shares of the index funds?

Thanks for your input.",finance,1408727219

FI Goal: 1MM by 40

* debt: 10k on a car with 0.99% financing
* monthly expenses: 2k (rent a 1-bedroom apt)
* monthly pay: 9k (gross) about 7k net

* Cash: 30k
* 401k: Fidelity 61k (maxed out yearly now Target Date) (company match 0.75 on the dollar for 6%)
* Roth IRA: Vanguard 33k (target date) (maxed out yearly now although this was the last year I could contribute to it)
* sIRA American Funds: 16k (got set up at my last job and ignored ever since- is this still tax * advantaged?)

Taxable Investments: 

* 30k (Vanguard lazy three fund admiral 33%inlt, 33% total stock, 33% bonds)
* 17k Franklin Templeton (set up at last job)
* etrade: 6.6k random ""fun"" stocks like apple and tesla (this is play money)

Current Net Worth: $210k

Questions:

1. Where do I put my bonds? I did 10k in bonds in the taxable Vanguard lazy just so I could get admiral shares. I know my 401k and Vanguard ROTH have bonds as well, so does this seem bond heavy? The rest is stocks

2. Real Estate: I really want to get into Real Estate but I am not married and I don't want to buy a house by myself. Or should I? I was thinking of putting some money (10k?) into REIT in the health sector- but I read you should do this in your tax advantaged accounts so you don't get taxed twice. Good idea? Pros/Cons?  Should I just buy a house instead? If I did I would want a duplex(350k) or triplex(450k) to create passive income. Do I throw 10k in a REIT while I look around? 
SO makes about what I make although he has much higher future earning potential. We plan to be married at ""some point"" but who the hell knows when that is. Home prices in my area are starting to recover/go up, along with interest rates. I am worried that I am letting my fear drive me to not buy a house when I know deep down I should buy now before the economy recovers here. Would it be better for me to get the duplex loan by myself anyway (lower income app on the loan)? Would that ""protect me"" if we got married and it didn't work out? Would that property always be mine? Should I dump the Franklin templeton/etrade money plus 20k cash for a dp on a place? I know I pay taxes on my earnings but I don't think the money is good sitting there with the high fees anyway

3. Future Pipeline Potential: I'm confused.  This year I threw 5.5k at Roth, and 17.5k at 401k. CAn I also put money in my simple IRA? If I move the simple to Vanguard, they would convert it to a traditional IRA. What's the difference? I read that if you contribute to both Roth and Traditional it can potentially mess up your future planes to pipeline.  IE- when you're ready to pipeline your Roth, you would open a tIRA then begin your pipeline. If I open a tIRA now it complicates things re:taxes, right?

I am excited about the future and I feel like I know just enough to be dangerous to myself, here. I need some wisdom and support, here!

Any advice?

personalfinance,Applied for a credit card with BofA in order to build credit. Got turned down. Options?,"Newbie here. Ok so long story short, when I was 17 and just entering college I opened up a student checking account and savings account at BofA. I was incredibly financially niave and the rep talked me into getting overdraft protection and a credit card attached to the account without explaining to me really how it all worked. yikes. So obviously everytime I overdrew it would borrow money from the credit card in $100 increments and I was young and not really paying much attention. Fast forward a few years and I had a $500 balance on the card and wasnt great about making payments either so it accumulated interest. Luckily, I got my shit together eventually before it got too out of control and as soon as I landed a somewhat decent job I paid off the balance in a few large payments but by then the card was frozen/cancelled by BofA so I happily went without it for a couple years. Now that I'm out of college and a bit wiser I'd like to start building my credit. But I applied for a credit card with them and was denied, I'm assuming because of my poor credit history with that card. So what do I do now? Are there some other options for a credit card that I can apply for that I will be more likely to get approved for? I'm assuming my options will be limited to those with higher interest rates but since I'm conscientious about my budget now and strictly looking to use it to build my credit, not spend frivolously, any purchases I make will be ones I can immediately pay off in full.

I have been reading through this subreddit and I see a lot about paying back student loans and whether to consolidate your debt or not and different government programs available to all. My questions are in similar aspects.

Currently I am entering my senior year of college double majoring in Sales &amp; Business Marketing and also Finance. I plan to go into Sales after college since that has been something I've always enjoyed.

Financially I will be in about 32k worth of debt. 24k in Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans and about 8k in private loans through Salie Mae. I do not know my interest rates through the government loans because I just have always filed my FASFA and accepted the needed amount. Salie Mae is a variable interest rate around ~9% I believe.

My questions are..

After college I understand I need to start paying back these loans, will I have to pay monthly to the government loans and Salie Mae at the same time or will the 32k be one monthly bill? If they are separate bills do I consolidate them?",finance,1408731936
personalfinance,Should I cash out Simple IRA from old job to pay down massive SL debt?,"Hi, long time, first time. Wife and I have TONS of SL debt. Maybe about 200k worth in total. We both work, though I make way more than my wife who foolishly went to law school but dropped out and is now left with mega student loan debt. My SL debt is from obtaining a degree which actually got me a well paying job in a very stable industry. This debt is crippling us. My goal is to get her to the point where her payments are gone as fast as possible since I will always be in a better position to land a better paying job. Her interest rates are also the worst (~8%). So I have this Simple IRA plan from 2 jobs ago which was started in 2008 and haven't made any contributions to it since I left about 3-4 years ago. It's grown, it's not a lot, maybe 13k but I was debating on taking that and throwing at my wife's SL principle to both knock down her minimum payments some and speed up this repayment process. She is currently paying way more than the minimums to help speed this up too. I'm not able to save for retirement right now anyway due to our SL debts and mortgage payments so I figure the quicker I pay off this stuff the quicker I can start hoarding cash for retirement again. I imagine there will be a penalty for early withdrawal, but whatever I just want it gone. Thoughts?  

TL;DR Have shit-tons of SL debt, can't save for retirement right now anyway, want to cash out a 13k simple IRA plan I don't contribute to in order to take a decent chunk our of outstanding SL principle.

I already looked at my credit report and fixed an account that was 2 years old. I told the company I would pay it in return for removal. How much it will affect my score is anyone's guess. Will they really request a removal? I'll know next month. My credit is hovering around 630 depending on the bureau. Yeah, I didn't know about the money I owed.

Right now I have about $1000 a month in income. I live at home. I save up for things; I'm saving for uni next year, but my non-negotiable expenses are right around $450 for the long-term. The $450 is a student loan and I'm paying more than the minimum payment each month.

Yes I get crappy pay. I have a job where I work at home for an international company.

personalfinance,advice for 23 y.o. with an investment account for retirement,"Graduate student working on a master's degree here, no debt. worked for a year before going back to school, and saved up some money.

About a year ago with the help of a trusted family friend I started two online accounts with an online brokerage. One is your run of the mill stock market account, and one is a Roth IRA. I placed the maximum contribution into the IRA, and another 10k into the other account. I also have another 5-ish k in federal savings bonds sitting in a security deposit box, that were issued 20ish years ago, and are near maturity.

One thing that I am trying to decide whether or not to do this year is cash the bonds, and add them to my IRA as my 2014 contribution.

The accounts are basically mirror images of each other as far as the portfolio is concerned, a mix of ETF's and individual stocks, that are on an aggressive growth track.

My wife is moving from full time to part time to be with our new child more. Her income before going part time was $60k/yr, after it will be about $28k/yr before taxes. She contributes a maximum of 6% to her retirement accounts, and her employer matches 3% (50% match, max 3%). The majority of her income is taken due to taxes on my income (we file jointly), and our health insurance once she works part time. Since she will be working only part time and adding on the kid, our health insurance costs skyrocket to about $800/mo through her employer. We have shopped around and found most plans through independent insurance/obamacare to be about the same cost. Her income seems to be washed out before we have a chance to touch it.

The nice part of her situation is she can ramp up her hours to full time within a month if needed if my work slows down.

personalfinance,"My school's financial aid screwed me over. Should I go to school for a full year, or take a quarter off?","I originally posted this in /r/makemychoice, and was advised to post it here. I apologize in advance for the long post. I tried to cut it down as much as I could.

Last year, I was able to go to my first year of college at UCSD with relative ease, as I had a surplus of financial aid, which I used to help me pay for expenses like off-campus rent, utilities, food, and other things.

This year though, my financial aid award was drastically reduced and now I will owe my school $2,354 after taking out a federal loan. This has left me without a source for me to pay for my other expenses, which, after looking over last year's, could add up to being around $12,000 or so for the year, assuming fixed prices and similar buying habits on my part. I could in theory make it work, as I have about $23,000 in savings right now, but it will be painful. 

I've considered not going to school in the fall to save some money. My costs to go to school this year would then go down to about $10,000 total with tuition included, since my tuition and financial aid are both cut down. If I find a job at home during fall, then the money from that would help me out when I go back in January.

Either way, I would try to find a second job down near school outside of a work-study one to help me. I've considered declining my friend's offer to rent with him because he's fixed on having his own room, which ends up costing me more. I've considered living much more frugally (avoiding eating out, buying only necessities, etc.). What I cannot do though, is ask my parents for money. They're pretty old and living from paycheck to paycheck, and couldn't bear the cost. They have no clue of how bad the numbers are for me.

So I ask, what do you think I should do? I honestly would love to go back to school sooner because I've come to enjoy it, but I have to consider money. Is there some other idea or option that you have? If you need more information, ask me. I thank you in advance.",finance,1408748783

* Current balance: $11,907.45
* Monthly payment: $220

For the past year I've been on a strict budget, but now I have a little more freedom and I'm looking to pay $400-450 a month regardless of my monthly payment. Ideally I'd like to pay my car off in 36 months now.

I recently checked my credit score on Credit Karma and it's at 700. 


So my question is, since my rate is already fairly low, and I'm planning on almost doubling my payments, is it worth it to refinance?

I'm also not sure where to look- most places are advertising in the 2.3-2.9% range. I was thinking I would check out a local credit union, PenFed, Wells Fargo and Chase.

personalfinance,Question about Personal Loans.,"Hi,

I am in the process of interviewing for a salaried position in a large city in the American Southeast. Long story short, if I get the job, I will not have the necessary funds to pay for living expenses for the first month, and only the first month, after that I'd be fine. I am without a car, at the moment, and my housing options are limited due to short notice and distance.

I have never had a credit card before, nor have I borrowed money before. I have only had a checking and savings account. I just graduated college.

Are there any lending options out there for someone like me? I understand that I would likely have a huge interest rate if I could find anything at all, but it will be very short term. I would only need to borrow $1,500-$2,000 max.

So with roughly $1,109 left over after paying my bills, the majority of that money goes towards gas, food, eating out, entertainment, and my girlfriend. I usually have around one to two hundred dollars at the end of the month that roll over into the next month and make extra payments on my credit cards whenever I can.



I try to be as frugal as possible. I eat breakfast either at home or at my girlfriend's college cafeteria. I'll either bring lunch to work, leave work early to eat at home, or go to work late and just eat brunch. Yes, sometimes I do end up buying lunch. I do eat out with friends from time to time, I try to save this to just special occasions. For example, I spent $30 this week for half the bill on a restaurant because a friend was going back to Japan.



I do have random expenses that come up. For example, I recently started going back to school. For my six units of classes, books, and other fees including parking pass was around $400 at a community college. About $100 of that I had to pay for with a credit card because I didn't have enough cash.


My goal with going back to school is to learn a new skill in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and hopefully get a new higher paying job soon and increase my credit card payments every month to get out of debt faster.


In September, I have a friend's wedding and in October, I have another wedding. I did some research about how much is appropriate to gift for a wedding depending on how well you know the person and other factors and plan to give $150 for each respective wedding from my girlfriend and I. My girlfriend will help contribute some of the amount.


I have almost $12,000 in my Roth IRA, contributing $100/month. I have no savings, I'd rather pay down my debt as soon as possible with my high interest rates.


Any tips would be greatly appreciated! My goal is simple, pay off debt by highest interest rate first while looking for a new job, then save up to move out of my parents house.

I graduated this May and have been working since June 9. I make $5,000 / month after tax, retirement fund, Health Savings Account and random benefits. 8% is going toward my 401k (4% ROTH and 4% standard; 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds. Employer doesn't match). My company has a  pre-selected mutual fund that I use. Is it smart to trust the defualt as it has been selected by a money manager who researched the accounts, or should I be looking into it myself? I have been considering opening an IRA but i'm not sure if it is necessary because I already have 8% going to my 401k. 

I currently have $17,500 in student loan debt that will begin accruing interest in December (6 months after graduation). I plan on returning to school for a masters in August 2016, with or without it being fully paid for. I can post the different interest rates for the loans if anyone is interested, but they are all federal student loans with interest rates below 6%. What do you guys think is the best course of action, to pay off the loans before December or to create a nest egg for next year when I return to school. If I enroll in school the interest will stop accruing because I will be a student. 

I also owe my dad $15,000. He helped me get on my feet after graduation. He expects to be repaid but he does not need the money back asap.

I currently have $10,000 saved. I own my car and I paid the insurance for the next 3 months. My expenses are:

gas - $100/month
 
rent (apartment) -  $750/month

utilities - $150/month

food/necessities (i'm single) - $150/month

entertainment - Maybe spend ~$50/month

I have 3 credit cards that I use to build credit. I never spend more than is in my checking account and I pay them off at the end of the month.

personalfinance,401k Rollover question (First time homebuyer penalty),"Ok so I don't even know if this is even ""possible"" but I figured i'd ask.

My 401k plan I have is honestly pretty shit, zero matching, really poor rate of return (1-2% on average from past 10 years) and basically......pretty poor choices of investments.

Im planning on rolling over my 401k plan to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). My 401k Website has an ""In service withdrawal"" with a distribution type of ""rollover funds only"" and then goes to describe how to do that. (So Im assuming im ""allowed"" to do that)

Now I've been at the job for a little over a year and a half. So what I have in there right now is like....10K, not a lot but it's only been a year or so.

That being said, I was actually considering rolling over the amount to an IRA and then using it for a downpayment on a house. I know crazy right? But right now.....im pretty financially stable. I have a 5 month emergency fund, but basically rent right now....is kinda keeping my savings down. I've cut EVERYWHERE else possible.

I still save 10%, but rent is increasing QUICKLY around my city and just outside of the city are good housing locations for MUCH cheaper. So im really trying to put a downpayment on a house (20% to avoid PMI) and if im able to rollover and pull that money out (and avoid 10% penalty since first time homebuyer) it seems like a decently smart move. I have good credit and with my estimations from average houses in the area, my ""mortage"" would drop from around 1k a month to around 700 or so. (So a decent savings at that).

I know a lot of people will say it's a terrible idea (and I respect that), but I mainly want to know if it's possible. Because paying almost 1k in rent right now is really bumming me out. (I don't want a crazy big house, just a starter home thats cheap). 

So is this possible? Im assuming I would get normal taxes taken out, but really I plan on investing new money (that would've been that extra rent money i'd be paying, since ill have a cheaper mortage) so a Traditional IRA/Roth that has better returns (which is a whole nother subject)

If this is possible what do I need to do? Are there any ""gotchas"", as in like what if SOMEHOW their 401k gets better, can I not invest in it anymore if I do a rollover? Same with the IRA? if I withdraw from it early.....will I not be able to contribute (which would be fine, I could just contribute to ANOTHER IRA/type for a few years, since I plan on having 2).

edit: I see IRA contribution limit is 5500, can I still do it with 5500?

I have no debt. (besides a really low interest rate car payment, around 220 a month)

personalfinance,A different way to pay down debt? (Avalanche and Snowball methods included as comparison),"This may be a pretty long post, so let me start with a short version at the top, and if it seems interesting enough and you want details keep reading. I checked the rules and I believe this to be a valid post, but if there are any problems please let me know!


Short Version:

I developed what I believe is a hybrid of the snowball/avalanche system that seems to be consistently equal to, or better, at paying off debt than either, if you are making relatively small overpayments (paying less than twice the minimum monthly payment total of your debts). I did this by weighting the value of the principal saved when paying off a source of debt, against the duration it would take to pay off that debt as well as the interest on the source of debt. I have developed a matlab program (source code available on request) and tested it against my own as well as other people's debts and it seems to consistently save money over either of the other two options, sometimes a marginal amount, and sometimes a considerable amount.



Long Version:



Bona Fidas:

So it is clear where my strengths (and weaknesses) are. I currently have a masters in mathematics and am getting a PhD in mathematics from a top tier school in the US. I have zero official background in economics or finance, but my father did financial programming for decades and saw to it that I was at least passably financially literate before going to college.



The Reason:

My wife and I acquired quite a significant amount of debt as we were both students together and making very little money at the time. When we got to the point where paying more than minimal payments became an option I decided to sit down and develop a method from scratch for paying off debt in a way that made sense to me mathematically. Keep in mind this is designed as a math person, so there very well could be (huge) financial holes in this reasoning, which is a main reason for me posting this.



The Idea:

So, I started with the two ways of paying debt that my father taught me, the snowball and avalanche methods. Although easy to determine, this seemed rather heavy handed for someone spending entirely too many years studying the nuance of mathematics, so I decided to forget all of that and determine from scratch how I would think to pay debt. I started by assuming that the best way to pay debt would be to make sure that every dollar I spent was worth the most at the time I spent it. The balance that I found precarious was that the higher interest rate loans (like Credit Cards) tended to have low minimum payments, thus paying that off seemed like it would be a good idea, but it actually freed up very little cash. Likewise the low principal payments also had low minimum payments, and freed up little cash to work on the next loan as well.So, my idea was to find a way to determine what the balance of interest rate to principal to minimum payments freed up the most money to actually snowball other loans the most efficiently.



The Nuts and Bolts:

The method works by using these assumptions:

1) Pay minimum payments on everything.

2) Take all remaining money and put it toward one particular payment until that debt is completely paid off.

3) Repeat as above (note that the minimum payment of previous loan is now folded into 'remaining money')


So, using these assumptions my program calculates how long it would take to pay off each of the sources of debt, and then divides how much the source of debt took to pay off (the total spent to pay off the loan) by the minimum payment of that debt... then takes the best of the results. Thus the program's goal isn't to pay off the loan with the highest interest, or the lowest principal, but with the best payoff cost to minimum payment ratio, thus maximizing cash flow (by maximizing how much you get in cash flow per dollar spent).

When it calculates how much it would take to pay off each source of debt, it does so by iterating the source of debt on a per month basis, adding in the interest rate against the debt each month at the end of the month based on that debt's APR, thus it calculates an accurate amount to pay it off, not just a simple estimate. This assumes that the APR is compounded monthly, which I realize is not necessarily the case, but to change it more would require enough effort at the time, so I could add this in if needed.



The results:

Below are a few results using anonymous data I collected from some people. I include the ""Loan File"" which is a list of debts formatted as follows: [Loan Number, Principle amount, APR, Minimum loan Payment]. Below that is a list of basic methods and their results:

LoanFile =

Loan Number | Principle amount | APR | Minimum loan Payment
-------------|-|-|-
    1 |  1956.72 | 8.5 | 34
    2 |  2359.68 |  8.5 |  39
    3 |  1985.16 |  2.99 |  181.83
    4 |  2000.13 |  14.9 |  42

    11 |  347.11 |  22.9 |  25         


Now, assuming I pay $700 a month, total, the following are the results for this loan table:


FORMATTING DESCRIPTION:

The matrices below are formatted as follows: 
The first column is the order of the loans you should pay off, 
The second column is how many months it will take to pay off that loan. 
The Last column is how much you should pay towards that loan each month.
For example if your matrix looks like this: 

 Loan# | Payoff Time(Months) | Payment
-------|---------------------|--------
3 | 5 | $266.00
1 | 10 | $2291.00
2 | 7 | $312.00

This means you should pay the third loan you listed first, and it should take 5 months at $266 a month. 
Next you should pay off the first loan you listed and it should take 10 months at $291 a month. 
Finally you should pay the second loan you listed which should take 7 months at $312 a month.

Using this method you would pay all the debt off in 47 months. 
 This method costs a total of $47013.30.

**Results**

The best method is the snowball method, beating my homebrew method by about $1000.



In general it appears my homebrew method works well if your total payments towards your debt is below twice your total minimum payment (above the total minimum payment is ~550, and my homebrew method stays better than the snowball method until about ~$950), above that the snowball method seems to work about as well, or sometimes a little better. I will include a different loan file example below as well.


So, there is my method. I'm wondering if any finance people can offer any improvement advice on the program. Currently the only problems I see are: 

There is no way to set a max life on a loan (Things like car loans that the minimum payment may not pay the loan off in time, so it needs to have more added to it before a certain time date)

The interest in compounded monthly instead of daily or weekly or any other choice (I don't even know how often interest is compounded for different sources of debt, information on that would be helpful).


Thanks!

dogecoin,More than 75% of doge Volume is trading doge with Chinese yuan,"When i joined this community several months ago most of the trading was between doge and bitcoin (over 1million dollars a day). This makes sense as doge was the most profitable coin to mine during that period so many of the miners were dumping doge for BTC and continually driving the price down. (if anyone has heard the recent problem with the hash rate it is because doge is now less profitable and the only miners left are those committed to dogecoin) Although the amount of volume between doge and BTC remains 17% because mining doge is still somewhat profitable and mining pools occasionally switch to partially mine doge along with other alt coins. This has resulted in a more stable price floor but miners will switch back to doge if the price rises past a certain point.

So why are chinese investors still buying doge? well some of the trading is on BTER and for those who dont know BTER offers interest on coins you have stored on the site, and since doge offers the second most interest (1.13%) its possible the Chinese are buying just so they can collect the high interest rate

my other theory is that they are familiar with the Shiba inu as it is native to the far east

TLDR: we have lost all the auto dumping miners and the price is now reliant on Chinese invertors

resulting in a lower hashrate but more stable price

Bitcoin,To be clear: An unfavorable ruling by the European Court of Justice regarding VAT and Bitcoin would make accepting Bitcoins for merchants in the EU around 20 % more expensive than other payment solutions.,"**Scenario: Carlos, a customer, buys a pizza from Mark, the merchant, and pays in Bitcoin.**

First of all: **The question is not, whether VAT applies to the pizza**. That will definitely be the case. If I'm buying a laptop in, let's say, Germany for 1190 EUR, then 190 EUR of that (VAT in Germany is 19 %) goes to the tax man, regardless of whether I pay with euros, bitcoins or gold.

The question is, what happens to the bitcoins afterwards. The merchant now has bitcoins and will want to get rid of them at some point. Either to exchange for euros or to buy a product or service. **So he is again selling a ""product"" (this time bitcoin, considered a commodity under current German tax law, as far as my reading of the law goes). If the product is not ruled VAT-exempt, he will have to pay another 19 % (or whatever the rate in his country is) at that point.**

That's the issue.

Another question is, whether that also applies, if the merchant uses BitPay. **In the worst case, BitPay could be considered as just an agent acting in the name of the merchant (their [terms of use](https://bitpay.com/legal) suggest something like that), thereby still putting the merchant in a position, where he - from a tax perspective - has briefly owned bitcoins and then sold them again.**

In my opinion, **this tax question is super critical and needs to be the top discussion right now**. The Bitcoin Foundation and other Bitcoin associations (Bundesverband Bitcoin e.V. in Germany) need to closely follow the case C-264/14 Skatteverket v David Hedqvist where the European Court of Justice will decide about just that. And we need to provide resources to bring about a sensible ruling.

See http://www.bitcoin.se/2014/08/21/i-need-your-help-funding-legal-costs-in-a-case-at-the-eu-court-of-justice-related-to-bitcoin-and-vat-exemption/ and consider donating!

Edit: I should have added the disclaimer, that I'm not a lawyer and this is just my personal interpretation, which very well might be wrong. I have however been following this topic for a while, talked to various parties and read some of the laws involved.

Edit 2: Alright, a little intermediate summary of the discussion below:  I'm probably mistaken about the details of case C-264/14 as /u/rtuck99 pointed out. It seems that case will only deal with the question of whether bitcoin exchange fees are VAT-exempt. In my opinion my larger point still stands though, that the ECJ will likely decide about VAT on the bitcoins themselves at some point. Compare the [UK guidelines](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/briefs/vat/brief0914.htm) on Bitcoin and VAT with [this statement by the German Federal Ministry of Finance](http://www.bundesverband-bitcoin.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/140512-Antwort-PStS-Meister.pdf) (in German, alternatively see this [press release by Bundesverband Bitcoin e.V. in English](http://www.bundesverband-bitcoin.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Press-Release-Bundesverband-Bitcoin-PM-14-002_eng.pdf)). These two guidelines are - in my opinion - incompatible with each other. Something that ultimately the ECJ will have to resolve. Maybe that will not happen as part of case C-264/14 (but it might, as it's somewhat related, so it still seems risky to me, to let David Hedqvist fight that on his own), but it will happen eventually and we need to have our side presented well then.

Edit 3: David Hedqvist [commented below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ecxky/to_be_clear_an_unfavorable_ruling_by_the_european/cjyn8sh) that the case might indeed deal with the issue in a broader sense.",cryptocurrency,1408793326
personalfinance,Looking to Move in the Right Direction…,"Hi Everyone!

I just wanted to ask a few general questions regarding my financial future and what exactly the best move is going to be moving forward in the next few years. To start, let me outline my current situation:

DEBT
Money in Life Savings: $12,000
Car Debt: $16,000 (2.09% Interest Rate)
Credit Card Debt: $0
Student Loan Debt: $0

MONTHLY BILLS
Rent: $500
Car Loan: $400 (Although I only owe $340/mo)
Phone: $100
Car Insurance: $200
Gym: $40
Gas: $150-200
Dating: $120
Groceries: $50
Fast Food/Restaurants: $120

INCOME:
9-5 Job (Full Time): $51,500 annually
Side Work (Part Time): ~$5,000 annually

I think that outlines about everything. Currently, I have 3.5 years left to pay off my car on a 5 year plan. I know it is more expensive, and not as economical, but I am 6’4’’ and need a larger car (Honda Accord), and I am also in my car 10-15 hours a week for work and life, so I needed something comfortable. 

Currently, I have no investments, so what I have listed above is my total financial situation. That being said, starting next month, my work offers a 401K plan where over a year, I put in a total of at least $5,000 and they will match $2,500. I intend to fully utilize this, but I think that means another $400 a month into that account, as opposed to in liquid savings...

The reason I am writing this post is to outline my situation and get some advice on the following potentially big life changes in the near future. My primary goal is actually that my girlfriend and I are getting more serious and are thinking that marriage is in the cards in the next 2 years. She lives long distance, and is considering moving to Virginia summer of 2015, and we would buy a house together. Due to our personal beliefs, we would not live together before we are married. Probably what will happen is that I will stay renting where I am, and I would save up and buy a house/townhouse that she could move into and rent from me (so no monthly payment on my end, just the downpayment) for a year while we finalize everything. 

All that being said, I had hoped to pay my car off quick before that, but VA housing is very expensive and I think I should be focusing on that. Basically, I am trying to figure out the best way to utilize my income and plan for the future/invest/save while still taking into account all these big life actions in the process. 

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks everyone!",finance,1408799042

Thank you for referring the complaint of Xxxxxxxxx to our office for review. We appreciate this matter being brought to our attention. Xxxxxxxxx expressed concern regarding speed issues.

Rest assured, Verizon has been and remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want. Information concerning Verizon's commitment to our broadband Internet access customers can be found at: http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment.

As noted above, our policy remains to provide every Verizon FiOS customer with full access to the legal content, applications, and services of their choice, regardless of source.

We understand that in recent months some customers have experienced occasional performance issues while accessing certain Internet content, including Netflix, over their Verizon broadband connections. While Verizon treats all Internet traffic equally on our network, many factors other than Verizon's network management practices can affect t e speed a customer experiences for a specific site, including, for example, that site's servers and the way the traffic is routed over the
Internet. This last factor in particular appears to have affected the performance of some customers’ experience in accessing Netflix, as it appears that this traffic has often been routed to our network over other providers’ who have not made arrangements with us for connections capable of handling the traffic volume associated with Netflix. To improve our mutual customers‘ Internet _experience, Verizon and Netflix recently have entered an arrangement to establish direct connections of adequate capacity for Netflix traffic destined for customers on Verizon's network. Once these connections are in p ace, this should improve the experience for consumers interested in using the Netflix service.

The events in Ferguson Missouri will no doubt produce a flurry of discussion on Capitol Hill on the advisability of militarized police forces. It will give our legislators something to bluster about.


At some point, I suppose, some diligent congressman will wonder at the scope of this give-away program. It is massive beyond belief. And its success should come as no surprise - the price is right. Just ask and pay the shipping. This is like free Amazon.


&gt;The Department of Defense Excess Property Program (1033 Program) is authorized under federal law and managed through the Defense Logistics Agency's Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) in Ft. Belvoir, Va. The 1033 Program provides surplus DoD military equipment to state and local civilian law enforcement agencies for use in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism operations, and to enhance officer safety.


The 1033 program has transferred more than $4.3 billion in equipment since 1997. In 2013 alone it gave nearly half a billion dollars worth of military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, according to the program's website.


At the other end - the military end - they're delighted. They don't care if the receiver has a legitimate use. For them this is non-stop Spring cleaning. Understand, all of this stuff has already been offered in-house and been declined. Their closet is full. They've run out of space. 

And this partly happens because a commander might actually need four widgets. But just to be safe he requests six. The manufacturer tells him it is not cost effective to produce six. He will, however, be glad to deliver twelve.


To make matters worse military procurement is a Ponzzi scheme that dwarfs anything on Wall Street. If you don't use your budget it may get reduced next time around.

personalfinance,Should I start a Roth Ira with low income and no 401k?,"I've been itching to pull the trigger on a Roth Ira but have been getting lots of differing opinions and need some help deciding. First off I'm 25 years old and make roughly $24k a year. I have $18k in student loans with about $2.5k at a high 6.5% interest rate and rest at lower rates. In my savings I have enough emergency funds to last 3-6 months with an extra $3k to either spill into my student loans and start a Roth Ira. However if I start my Roth with my low income I would only beadle to contribute $100-200 monthly. If I can't max out at $5500 yearly would it still be worth it? Is having a Roth Ira that meets all the lowest contributions still worth it in the long run? Right now going forward my plan is to pay down the $2.5k high rate student loan off and use $1k and start a Roth at Vanguard with monthly contributions at $100 for the time being. Would any other investment company be better for me? I also do not have 401k with my employer as they don't match so I decided against. Should I even be worrying about a Roth when I haven't been putting into a 401k yet? I have so many question guys, I'd love to hear advice for anyone.",finance,1408825520
personalfinance,Mortgage Refinancing - 15yr vs 30yr with investments,"As interest rates are fairly low at the moment, I've been considering refinancing my mortgage and wanted to make sure that I'm thinking things through correctly. Thanks for taking a look.

**Current:**
~29 years left on a 30 mortgage at ~4.75%, costing $2,910 per month (though I pay an even 3k). Assuming I'll be in this house for ~15 years.

**Refi Option 1 (15yr):**
15 year, at ~3% costing $3,200 per month

**Refi Option 2 (30yr):**
30 year, at ~4% costing $2,210 per month, investing most of the difference.

Now, I understand that with a direct comparison of the 15 year mortgage vs the 30 year mortgage, the 15 year saves a lot of money over the entire course of the mortgage. However, there is almost $1,000 a month to put to work with the 30yr vs the 15yr! That money could be directly invested, or we could try something a little more creative... This house has an unfinished basement that could be remodeled for ~$150,000 into a mother-in-law that could be rented out for $1k-1.2k per month. The idea is that the 150k would come from a Home Equity Loan, and then the rent would pay off that loan. The money saved on the mortgage refi would be a safety net for when there is no renter, and would be invested when we do have a renter.

What do you think? Any kind of feedback would be helpful.

computers,Asus International Warranty Nightmare,"I'm an American expat living in Mexico and I love gaming. A while back I decided that my old laptop was not good enough to play any of the new games so I purchased a new ASUS G750 from B&amp;H photo and had it sent to me here in Mexico. After a setting up most of it I discovered that the web cam on the computer was not working. After a prolonged ""assistance"" from tech support from Asus US they determined that the problems was with the unit and not the drivers. To which they said I should contact Asus Mexico since I would have to RMA with them since it's where I currently reside. 

At first I was glad that I had purchased the computer that came with an international warranty and soon after contacted Asus Mexico and sent it in to get the web cam repaired. Over a month after I sent it in, after numerous call, and email inquiring about different status I was receiving I asked to speak with a supervisor to no avail. Finally, when I received my computer back over a month I notice that part of the rubber footing on the top right of the screen was ripped off, furthermore, the left side of the lid is scoffed. I was furious that Asus Mexico clearly did not take the best care of my computer and they asked for picture of the damaged to be sent to them. Once I did and after repeated calls they said I would have to resubmit the computer for a new RMA where it might take at least a month or more with no guarantee that they would take any special care or priority despite having my computer damaged by Asus. I once again asked to speak with a supervisor, but again he avoided talking to me. 

I'm at my wits end and I don't know how to escalated this matter. I'm hoping someone here has dealt with Asus international warranty and can give me some advice on how to get this straighten out. Or should I just call it quits and be glad that at least I have a working machine? A lot of money was spent to purchase this computer and to have it shipped to me abroad. I've already reached out to B&amp;H and they were nice enough to say they would try to communicate with someone, but that hasn't worked. I've also tried to reach Asus US, but they said just to deal with Asus Mexico. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Prior to going into repayment, and while I was still in training with a combined yearly income between the two of us of about 80k, my wife applied for IBR. Sallie Mae (by their own admission) lost the IBR paperwork she submitted. When my wife resubmitted the paperwork Sallie Mae took several months to process it. In the interim, by some mysterious trick of SM financing they charged us with a late payment. This resulted in loss of the 0.5% interest rate reduction given to borrowers with no late payments. 0.5% on 84k could be quite expensive. 

We attempted to resolve this with Sallie Mae directly for about two months. We called and wrote emails. We requested documents. We submitted proof. We contacted their Office of the Customer Advocate. All to no avail. We were reminded of the treatment Sallie Mae gave to members of the military which [recently cost them $60M in a settlement with the DOJ.](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/13/sallie-mae-must-pay-service-members-60-million-for-student-loan-violations)

personalfinance,Paying off parents Credit Card Debt with Student Loan?,"This is my first time actually posting on Reddit aside from a few comments here and there, so please go easy on me.

I have been fortunate enough to earn a Bachelors degree without needing to take out any student loans. I plan on going to Pharmacy School, which should cost around 120K for the complete four years. At this point I won't have a choice but to take out a loan.

My parents are about 20k in debt, and I was wondering whether it would make sense to take out say a 150k loan, pay off my parents debt, put the money that would be going towards those bills in a separate account, and begin using that money to pay off the loan when I finish school and have gone through that 6 month grace period.
The loan will have a fixed interest rate because of the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act (if I understand it correctly) as opposed to the 16/18% loans my parents have on their credit card bills. 

I completely trust my parents, and I know they wouldn't turn their back on me. I'm the one who actually thought of doing this, so it's not as if they asked to just push their money problems off onto me.",finance,1408843555

Granted I paddled in my canoe with a former stranger turned friend turned shibe! Dragging his kayak behind us the entire way. chilling in my hammock at the moment. Jamming to classic rock from a solar powered radio. Marc is cooking beef-a-roni in a pot on a campfire we built.

 There is an owl that seems to be in desperate need of a mate - it is hooting like there was no tomorrow. That's pretty cool, but the BALD EAGLE I saw today was incredible. I am so glad that is our national bird instead of the turkey as Ben Franklin suggest. Also, the Ohio River has WHALES in it. Right as I was setting up my hammock, I saw the most grotesquely massive river creature EVER breach the water and make a splash only Queen Latifa at her largest off of a high dive in cannon ball position could have made. 

It's strange going from paddling alone to paddling with someone.  Very very different.  In all honesty I didn't mind being alone one bit - I think Marc was not as fond of the solo life as I. I told him I want him to meet many of my wicked awesome friends in Cincinnati so he always has a city he can feel home at on his travles, but we both agreed we should part ways for adventure sake after that. (And i may decide to race him in my much slower canoe and still win - haha my competitive spirit never ceases)

Erik “River Shibe” Barnum’s DOGEhio River Adventure
An adventure enthusiast and self-styled ‘business hippie,’ Erik Barnum, has embarked on a 3-month trip canoeing 1000 miles down the Ohio river, while surviving exclusively on tips in the form of 'Dogecoin.' Dogecoin is a digital currency which began as a joke but turned much more serious and has notably sponsored sportspersons ranging from NASCAR driver Josh Wise to a Jamaican Bobsled team and an Indian luger at the Winter Olympics.
Barnum says he wants to showcase the power of the Dogecoin community and is posting regular updates on Reddit's Dogecoin page. His documentation and recollection of the daily adventures appears to keep his followers entertained and every post has been raising around Ð100,000 to help him on his journey. Barnum believes that tipping is the future internet interaction and is putting his beliefs to the ultimate test by this 3-month long experiment which leaves him at the mercies of tips from the largely anonymous members of the Dogecoin community. Its members, who refer to themselves as 'Shibes,' have christened him 'River Shibe' for his journey.
Dogecoin has been in the news recently for a new system known as Dogeparty augmenting the utilisation of the Dogecoin network, and for a proposal to use Dogecoin for Microlending. Both the community and Barnum are keen on seeing their Doge being used as a regular currency. The generosity of the community, which has raised over $150,000 for charitable causes, is already setting it apart from its counterparts. With initiatives such as this from River Shibe, the community seems to have made the clear switch from joke to currency.

Any advice?,"I moved from Colorado to Massachusetts at the beginning of July. I started my job the second week of July and I got my first check on July 15th. Since I was late to open an account with Bank of America I had to get a hard copy check for my first pay period versus direct deposit. 

Since my account was so new and it was a large amount put into my account they put it on hold for 3 days (this was understandable). The following Monday I logged into my account and I found out it was closed. I called their risk department and they said they didn't want me as a customer anymore because the check came back fraudulent. This was absurd because this bank has hundreds of my employees that deposit their checks with them. After dealing with them for over a month I was finally able to get my money back from Bank of America. I decided to join a credit union so I wouldn't have to deal with the bullshit of BOA. 

I opened a checking account with Digital Federal Credit Union about 3 weeks ago. Everything was going fine and direct deposit was working correctly. About a week after opening my account I went to use my debit card to buy lunch and it came back declined. I called them up and they said I was put under a random audit. There was no notice beforehand and they didn't give me a time frame for how long the audit would last for. I went into their branch and one of the tellers didn't even know what I was talking about. We got a branch manager to help me and she said that they have a regional auditor come around to check accounts from time to time. She didn't seem confident in her answer but she said I would just have to wait until I got a call from the audit company in order to resolve my issue. 

I have waited about two and a half weeks now and there has still been no information from this audit. I have called the credit union multiple times and they said it should be any day now. I have had around $8000 in limbo since I have lived here and it is really starting to annoy me. Is there any advice I can take against this bank or do I just have to suck it up and deal with it? At this point if the credit union doesn't resolve my issue by Tuesday I will just close my account and try a third bank.

* Own two cars free and clear, no expectation to replace any time soon.
* No loans, or debt of any sort.
* 401(k) maxed every year.
* Spouse's IRA maxed every year.
* 100k HELOC, not used at all, 0 balance.  4% interest rate.
* Savings 18k, includes 10k emergency fund, and the rest is escrows for property taxes, insurance, vacation, and saving for other short-term goals.
* Retirement: His - 150k, Hers - 25k and growing
* Also Contribute $150/mo to a non-retirement mutual fund, trying to save the down payment on my ""retirement / dream house""
* All investments are in Stocks funds, not bonds.  My 401k is in mostly aggressive international funds because of my age.  Everything is managed by Vanguard.

I've really enjoyed my current rental, and have considered buying another local property for $30 or 40k using the HELOC and renting it out.  I believe I can get $700 a month based on my location and rental market values.  But an advisor told me I'm too heavily concentrated in Real Estate, especially considering the local nature. 

I really like the idea of monthly rental income and want to pursue that.  But is it wise.  Where else SHOULD I be investing?

I'm putting $1,000 a month in an emergency fund (CapitalOne Direct) which is at just under $10,000 right now.

I'm maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA. My retirement accounts (401k, IRA and pension) total around $67k.

I have another investment account through Vanguard with a current balance of around $4,000 that I'm contributing $100/month to.

If it's pertinent: I'm 30 years old and in a long term relationship (not married) with no kids. I don't own property, and have no debt other than the student loans.

So... what should I do with this extra money? My partner believes strongly that I should dump it all into the student loans because debt is bad and paying interest is a waste of money. I feel like a) I'm already paying the loans pretty aggressively and the saved interest will be negligible, and b) I'm still pretty far behind where I want to be in savings for my age/lifestage.

personalfinance,"Need some advice on how to attack debt now that my wife has a job (joint gross yrl inc ~$138,000.00) (US)","As the title indicates, my wife has finally found a job! Besides being 
ecstatic for her, I know we need to seriously attack our debt while we are both gainfully employed and dual income with no kids. 

We have about $175,000.00 in student loan debt, some small credit card debt ~$3k and my car payment. My first question is this: Although my car loan is at 0%, would it be better to pay it off after CC debt and savings account are paid off and filled, respectively, to free up cash flow to pay more on school loans, or should I not pay my car loan off early to free up the cash flow since it is a 0% interest loan, which is obviously less than inflation. 

**NOTE**: My wife only has federal loans, and the bulk of my debt is federal loans, but we both fully expect to have them forgiven on the 10 year Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, but we are both at the very beginning of that program. I'm less than 2 years into the program, and she is about to start it.

Also, currently my private school loan has a lower interest rate than my federal loans, which I hope to get for forgiven. Despite that, should I pay that loan off first since it is variable rate and the market will get better sooner rather than later or find something other productive use for that money (e.g., saving for house down payment).


I apologize if this post violates the rules. I read the rules, and I know that there is a Student Loans FAQ, but I couldn't find an answer for these specific questions.

Any advice is appreciated.",finance,1408912233
personalfinance,"401k funds good enough, or contribute to Roth IRA?","First, a little about me:

* 25 years old

* $67,000 annual salary

* $25,000 currently in 401k (I contribute up to match)

* Company match is 50% of 8%

* $25,000 currently in savings account. By my calculations this is about 10+ months of expenses, without changing my lifestyle. More if I cut back on things (which I no doubt would if I lost my job)

* No debt other than car payment ($500/mo @1.74%, $22,000 remaining) I know it may not be the wisest choice, but I love my car. KBB lists it around $29,000 for private sale, $27,400 for trade in.

I've also read through the [wiki on 401ks](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) and feel I have a somewhat basic handle on it, but could use a little guidance. Specifically, I'm looking for help pertaining to this quote:

&gt;Why contribute to an IRA? Shouldn't I go back to my 401k?

&gt;IRAs, since they are opened by individuals with a provider of your choice, are generally better than 401k plans because you have more fund choices. Low cost providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer low expense ratio index funds to invest in. However, if you have an excellent 401k plan such as the U.S. Federal government's Thrift Savings Plan or work for a large company that has negotiated institutional rates for the mutual funds in their 401k plan, you may want to do step 5a first and return to your IRA contribution afterwards.

personalfinance,Advice on defaulted private student loan debt,"Hi, I am posting this on behalf of my bf, hence the throwaway to preserve anonymity.  We live together, so financial issues are a matter of mutual concern.  In the case of this defaulted loan however, neither of us is sure how to fix the mess.  
My bf is currently in grad school, living frugally and barely making ends meet.  For comparison, I too am a grad student, and my stipend actually leaves me with significantly more income than his student aid+job.  Fortunately the vast majority of his student loans are federal, so they are in deferment until he graduates next year. 
However, he has one private loan, which his parents had cosigned for him and were making payments on for the last several years. About one year ago, the family went through severe financial hardship, and they stopped making payments. It's been a year now since the last payment has been made, and the loan is in default. 

Last month my bf received a letter from the lendor demanding payment. He was able to call and negotiate a payment plan with them that he could afford.  However, the month went by, and the lendor never withdrew the authorized payment from his account. When my bf investigated the matter, he found out that his parents have received a new letter from a different loan collections agency demanding payment of the full sum of 11k.  It seems like between July and August the debt has been sold to a new more aggressive collector.  
What options do they have now and what is the best approach on how to handle the debt?  No one has the 11k to pay this off, and it doesn't seem like the family can be relied on to handle the payments.  Is it likely to go to lawsuit of they keep ignoring this issue? I found that private loans pass beyond statute of limitations 6 years after payments stop, but it seems stupidly risky to just hope the debt goes away unnoticed. All the collections communications are going to the parents, who are not doing anything about the issue. I've been urging the bf to contact the collectors himself, but I have no idea what kind of negotiation strategy can be pursued here. Help?",finance,1408914216

Planning and investing for the future,"I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while now and wanted to see what the community might have to suggest for my situation.  We are nearly debt free (about 6mo left on payment on our car, and all school debt is paid off), own a home (with ~$220k left on our mortgage at 3.49%APR--we pay an extra $565 on principle every month), and have significant savings.  We're in our mid-thirties with two kids.  
  
I work for myself and make a fairly good income of about $10k/mo.  My SO worked in a stable job that received health insurance and 401k employer contributions.  My SO has left that stable job to focus on her own business, but has only a few paying clients right now.  Generally, I would not have encouraged anyone to leave a paying job for self-employment without having built up a paying client base, but this kind of work can be very difficult to do without focusing 100% of your effort on it.  And her network has been starting to pay off as she expects to ink a few fairly valuable contracts in the next 4 weeks.  I'm confident she'll be successful, but we are planning for a pay cut.
  
My investing thoughts have almost always been on acquiring some good stocks and owning some real estate as rental properties (we live in a California beach city, there's a big market for rentals).  Currently our only property is the one we live in.  However, we plan to upgrade to a larger home in a more desirable area within 18mos and to keep our existing home a rental income of about $600/mo after mortgage and insurance.  Buying in our desired area will require a sizable downpayment of around $150k plus reserve savings.  We currently have about $100k saved in addition to college savings for our kids and my SO's 401k.  
  
Most of this money had been sitting in a savings account until a few weeks ago.  I decided to put the cash into the market.  About $15k was already invested in some solid stocks that have done very well for me.  I took another $60k, and put $15k of it into two tech stocks that I see as good for shorter term growth, $25k divided between three index funds, and $20k divided between two bond funds--one domestic and one international.  All of our investing is with USAA since we do our banking and insurance with them.  It keeps things simple.  We also kept a $20k cash reserve fund since we have lost an income and will need a bridge until we start seeing some flow from my SO's business.
  
By percentages:  
27% Stocks  
22% Savings/Cash  
24% Index Funds  
26% Bond Funds  

So, the question is regarding the investments.  I know I haven't disclosed the specific funds or equities, but I would like some feedback on my mid-term plan and our current capital distribution.
  
Essentially, I want to put our savings to use in the market to hopefully generate some income instead of sitting in a savings account where it had been for the past years generating next to nothing.  We don't need access to it immediately and won't be harmed much if the market goes down.  But, even with the market inflated as it seems to be right now, there seems to be some steam left in it especially while interest rates remain low.  Our goal is to try and put away another $60-80k over the next 18mos that we can use in combination with the invested money toward our next home.  
  
I would really like to hear some r/personalfinance thoughts on this plan.  We have been pretty responsible so far, even with the lack of a 401k for me.  But, we've rarely consulted with anybody about our finances.  Some feedback and/or suggestions may really be helpful as we plan for our future.

First, some vitals: I’m 26, live in Austin, Tx, and pre-tax I make ~ 88k (83k base + variable bonuses) a year. I currently have a moderate emergency fund (3k, in this area if I were let go tomorrow I could live for about 3 months, maaaaybe a little more), I put 6% into my 401k (employer matched to $2500), and I just paid off the last of my credit card debt.

The only debt I have left are my student loans (~40k), and I have to start paying those back in September. The minimum payments are around $500, and my current plan is to try and pay way more than that (They're federal, so no prepayment penalty, hooray!). It seems like I have two options to deal with this debt as smartly as I can:

* Pay $1500 a month, and put $500 into a Roth.
* Pay $2000 a month, and leave the investing/saving to when I'm done.

-Job lined up after graduation with excellent benefits, $55,000/year

investing,Can investment really be a second income?,"Hello there,
Warren Buffet said once that investment should become a source of second income. So far, I agree. 

But can you really get a second income from investment? For me, a second income would at least be 2,500$ / month. 
For simplicity I just mutiply it by 12 and get 30,000$. Lets assume 5% p.a. interest rates, I would need 600,000$ sitting somewhere. That is a lot of money.

Then I ask myself, well how long would I need for this kind of money? Lets just assume I can save up a 1,000$ a month, and 5% p.a., then it would take me 25 years to save up this kind of money. 

Well, quite long. Out of curiosity how much would I have to save up for 5,000$/month second income? -&gt; 60,000$/year -&gt; 1,2 M$. With 1,000$ monthly and 5% p.a. would take me 36 years.

[10k$/month would take 48,6 years under these conditions]

But wait, I think, that doesn't seem like that much. Lets say I'm 25, then I'd be 50 for the 2,500$, and 61 for the 5,000$. [and 73 for the 10k$] Now all of a sudden, that doesn't seem that long. After all, I assume the 1,000$ are just investment money I don't need anyways. So before I retire I would net additionally 60k/year, rest of my life. 

I wonder if something like this is realistic, worth aiming at, or if you (dear reader) aim for something like a real second income, or something different entirely? Is this line of thought just unnecessary waste of my (and now: your) time, or just long term thinking?",finance,1408991789

Yeah, I've messed up pretty well here.

We have three children and rent a small place for $500 a month. My wife sporadically makes money selling Thirty-one bags, but she primarily takes care of and schools our children. I make about $2,140 every two weeks. We have no savings to speak of.

Our debt started when I was making much, *much* less money (about $21,000 per year) and we had a surprise with our first pregnancy. Being young and not knowing any better, I put the medical bills on the credit card. My wife ended up getting very sick and we just kept putting bills on the card and buying meals instead of cooking. We got used to it and, as I started making more money, we started spending more, I suppose.

Now we're sick of being in debt. We've physically destroyed the cards and I've started a budget with very little room for eating out at all and very little for non-necessities like entertainment, personal spending, etc. Currently, I've got about $1000 each month going to the credit cards, starting with the highest interest rate.

financialindependence,Lets talk asset protection strategies [US],"I haven't seen this topic discussed much around here, so I thought I would bring it up. Asset protection isn't something most people think about until they have either 1) accumulated a significant amount of wealth/assets or 2) been sued, but I think it's important to be cognizant of the issue as you progress toward FI.

It's disappointing that debt-averse finance personalities like Dave Ramsey rarely touch on this subject, because all of those people screaming ""I'm debt free!"" could easily have their assets (which they worked so hard for) taken away due to something as simple as a car accident. To be fair, I have not seen too many PF bloggers talk about this topic either.

I'm not an expert on this subject, but I know enough to be aware of some basic (and 100% legal) strategies, which I will share below. I'm not going to get into more complex strategies like trusts, offshore accounts, and forming shield corporations because I don't know how legal and legit they are. My general understanding is that if you are a listed owner of a trust or company, creditors can eventually come after those assets. It just takes longer for them to peel through the layers. And if you have been served papers for a lawsuit, or are aware of a potential pending lawsuit (for example, after a car accident), it's too late to implement asset protection tactics. A judge can undo any financial moves you make (such as transferring money from your account to your parents) in trying to protect your assets. So if you have a significant estate to protect, you should seek comprehensive advice from asset protection attorneys sooner than later.

1. Retirement accounts - IRS qualified retirement accounts like 401ks and IRAs are *almost* always protected assets. (401ks and other employer sponsored accounts are federally protected, but IRA protections vary by state, so check your local laws.) Creditors cannot go after these assets except for possibly the most recent 6 months of contributions. Another reason why maxing out your retirement contributions are always a good idea, and not cashing them out to pay off debts--especially if bankruptcy is inevitable. 

2. Homestead exemptions - Every state has a limited amount of homestead protection that cannot be seized by creditors; look it up and be aware of it. If you live in Florida or Texas, consider yourself lucky as your entire primary residence is protected. (It's also why OJ Simpson decided to buy a home and settle down in Florida.)

3. Mortgages - Not only do mortgages serve as a hedge against inflation, but they can also provide asset protection by hiding the equity in your property from third parties. Since mortgage deeds are publicly recorded documents, they can help to create the appearance that you're in debt up to your eyeballs like most ""normal"" Americans, and possibly help to stave off all but the most determined creditors. (Note: you might also be able to use a HEL or HELOC to accomplish this feat, so it isn't always necessary to take out a costly mortgage as many banks offer no fee HELOCs.)

4. Appear poor/broke - There is a reason I don't drive a BMW or Mercedes, or wear a Rolex watch or Gucci suits (other than the fact that I find these things gaudy). If I cause a fender bender in a parking lot, whomever I hit is less likely to pursue a lawsuit if they think I'm broke and poor like everyone else.

5. Umbrella insurance - Assuming you qualify (it usually requires no at-fault accidents within the prior 5 or 10 years), this is a cheap and common way to protect yourself from liabilities above and beyond what auto and home insurance policies usually cover. Once you exceed a six figure net worth beyond the protected asset classes mentioned above, it is usually worthwhile to look into obtaining this type of insurance policy to complement other catastrophic insurance instruments (disability/home/auto) in your life.

I will post some links in the comments with additional sources/info. If I've left anything out or made a mistake, feel free to add the missing information or correct any errors. There are usually exceptions to every rule, for example you probably won't be able to avoid the IRS for back taxes using any of these strategies, so be sure to do your own homework when making important estate decisions.",finance,1409011029
personalfinance,What to do with this crappy loan?,"I filed chapter 128 about two years ago, now.  It's a fairly ancient Wisconsin law which let me lock out any new interest payments on my credit cards as long as I agreed to pay the entire debt off in 36 months or less.  I am about to close in on the final year of this debt.  I still have about $12,000 remaining.  That payment is $800/mo

immediately before filing I bought a used car in OK shape so that I would have something reliable to get to work.  I commute 80 miles round trip and my daily driver had been wrecked a few weeks before.  I took out a loan and because I was already in process on this chapter 128 business I knew my credit was about to tank.  The loan amount was $9200 with a $228/mo payment over 48 mos.  I have $5700 remaining, APR is right around 8.75%.  Bummer right.  I also have $3000 against my 401k which I know is a miserable thing but this is what it took for me to start digging out, I went nuclear.  That has a much lower interest rate but I understand how it hurts me in the long run not having that money invested.

I make around $90,000 a year but my credit is in the shitter with the chapter 128, it's at 628 right now.  Do I have any options on the car loan to try and squeeze a lower rate?  I have an outstanding payment history with the current credit union, is it unheard of for them to consider a lower rate or am I effectively jammed up?  What options do I have to shop the loan elsewhere?  I could definitely afford to about double the payment rate as I have cleaned up some other smallish loans this month, freeing up about $450/mo.  Is it more sensible to attack the car loan first or the 401k loan?  The 401k debt is about half what the car is and almost no real interest, though it doesn't come without its own penalties.

The car loan has no penalty for early payment, nor I think does the 401k though I would def research that if that was the route to go.

financialindependence,401k loan for home at 10% interest?,"I know there's been a lot of discussion on this sub about whether taking a loan from your 401k for a down payment on a home is a good idea. And usually the consensus is a resounding ""no."" But what if the interest rate is really high? Say 10% for 10 years and you're taking it out today? Does a high interest rate make it a better risk?

Assume the following:

* Job security is a 9 out of 10 and you are planning on working at least until it is paid off
* There's enough in your Roth IRA to pay it off without triggering a taxable event, if absolutely necessary
* You'll continue to max out 401k contributions and your Roth while paying it off
* You can pay it off at any time with a balloon payment, no strings attached
* You are taking out enough to reach 20% down and avoid PMI, no more

My rationale for thinking this is a good idea is a textbook example of market timing... but in this case, I think it's good timing. I'm really nervous about the big gains we've had recently, and I feel like taking some of it off the table to put down roots makes sense since I can DCA back into the market. The skyrocketing housing costs in my market (Seattle) are yet another factor. I will get a 10% guaranteed return by making the regular payments, with the balloon payment option to jump all the way back in if the market totally tanks (and yes, I understand that's another instance of market timing).

Which brings me to the $80k we have in combined student loans. These have an average interest rate of about 6%, and at our current pace we will pay them off in mid-2017. My question is: should we continue to max our IRAs while we pay off our student loans, or would we be wiser to take that $11k per year and put it towards the student loans?

Thank for any advice/guidance!",finance,1409062790
personalfinance,Question regarding my credit and possible consolidation...,"A few years back, I dated a really bad dude. He was a con artist, a scammer and a drug addict, In addition, he was 6 years older than me.

None of this is very relevant, but this part of it is: He messed up his credit very early on. I turned 18 shortly after he got with me and he used my naivete to his advantage.

Telling me I needed to ""build credit"" for myself, he filed for two credit cards in my name. Given the fact that I had never had a credit card in my life, the CC companies happily handed them over. Citibank gave me a card with a $2,500 limit and Capital One with a $7,500 limit (a percentage of that being available for cash advance).

My ex then talked me into making him a card holder on the accounts, meaning I gave him permission to use these cards as well. He quickly maxed them both out. I will admit that I did some spending on them as well, but mainly on the Citibank one.

The bigger issue is that he used the Capital One card mainly for cash advances (he used every penny that was available for cash advance, probably around $3,500). For those who do not know, the interest rate on cash advances is HUGE. Now, a card with a $7,500 limit has ballooned to almost a $9,000 balance (despite making payments every month) off of interest alone.

I am really worried about all of this. I hate having debt at such a young age and more so, I am really worried about the affect this will have on my credit score when I go to buy a house or a car in my name. My parents help me with the minimum payments each month but they're not exactly wealthy.

Basically, we are making the minimum payments on the cards but not much else. Plus, with the interest rate causing the balance to grow, anything we pay off seems to be dwarfed in comparison. It's like flushing money down the toilet. I feel like I am in a tunnel with no light at the end... and I'm only 23 years old.

I have two questions regarding this issue.

1) How badly will this hurt my credit? Other than student loans and some medical bills (which are also being paid off), I have no other cards in my name. The issue is both of my cards are maxed out and I am only making the minimum payments and not much else.

2) Consolidation. I was advised to consolidate the balances to another card. The reason for this being that the balance will no longer be carrying the heavy ""cash advance interest rate"". Then, once this is done, I can begin making higher payments in getting the balances down (without my money just breaking even with interest rates). Is this a good idea? Also, what is a good company to do this with (in terms of lower interest rates)?

Sorry this is long. Any other advice is also welcome as well. Thank you!",finance,1409068073

personalfinance,"PF, halp me! Financial/Career Advise (21)","To summarize this post, I am 21 years old, I want to set up for a successful future (Duh) and I'd like people's advise on what career path I should take, my current financial situation and I'd like constructive criticism on the idea's I've came across with so far...Here goes...  

_______________________________________________________

Question 1: What to do with mah life?!
Seriously though, I just turned 21 in April, I am ambitious individual and I always strive to work hard and grow as an individual. I believe in ""hard work pays"" in all aspects of life, I've grown up in a household that lives paycheck to paycheck and while I initially accepted it, I've realized recently through personal finance that's not the lifestyle I want to choose for myself, all I need to do is work harder.  
  

Here's a quick layout of my work history:

 1 year assistant manager in Finance for Payday Loans
 (Promoted after 6 months, first job, don't use payday loans people.)
 
3 Months car salesmen with a Chevrolet/Buick/GMC dealership
 (Know your shit before you walk onto a car lot people.)

 1 Month working at a call center at a independent insurance agency
 (Tons of growth opportunities, current job.)




Things to note, I enjoyed management and sales at those points in time, though I didn't enjoy working 85 hours a week (I'm up for maybe 65 hours?) as a salesmen. Now taking that into consideration here's where I'm at...I need to become more proactive about setting up my future in regards to bringing in more income/growth opportunities for my career. I LOVE reading through Personal Finance on reddit, I would love to have a career that is similar where I learn how to manage money for myself and I advice people on spending their money, it's EXTREMELY practical. Another big concern however is having a career with growth opportunities, management, company hopping for higher salaries. My biggest concern is income, I want something that starts at maybe $40k that is achievable with an associates degree, but if I bust my ass or switch companies for salary raises, I could end up being at $100k. What are some career paths/schooling degrees that I can pursuit?  


________________________________________________________


Question 2: Plan to get out of ridiculous interest rates/Financial Advise?

Thanks to all I've read on PF, I've budgeted myself! Here's the catch, I wasn't always financially smart and at 19 with no credit, I was happy when a buy here pay here lot approved my sister's terrible credit for my current car at 25%! YAY! Now bail me out you intelligent fucks...

Income:


Lowest potential income per month:            $1574.00

General Living Expenses Section:

Car Payment: $370 Month

Gym Payment: $50 Month

Insurance Payment: $120 Month

Gas Payment: $140 Month




My living money ends up being only things I need to buy, food, cheap clothes for work when my current clothes go bad, or things to remain healthy while working out (pretty much protein/fish oil/vitamins). I generally have $100 leftover in spending money per month in all honesty. I do live with my parents so I'm in a solid place to be to handle this situation. I also would like to eventually save up for 6 months worth of auto insurance.


The Pain:

10 Day Payoff on Car: $9,700

Remaining 3 Year Payoff with interest: $15,000


I still have NO credit.

________________________________________________________


My Possible Conclusions:
Go to community college for a Business Finance associate degree, this should come with addition expenses, books, travel time, I doubt I'd have to pay much for tuition with my current household income. While doing this, I'd apply for a secure credit card and build my line of credit. After getting solid credit I'd try to approach my bank (Chase) and see if they offer any options for a $10,000 loan to payoff on the vehicle and then pay them back at a lower interest rate. Is this a thing? The car was signed under my sister's name and her credit hasn't improved at all so I need to find a way around the system. I will be very active about reviewing this forum, Reddit,  make my future!",finance,1409071105

My question is, do all these changes make it worth being a federal employee working for lower wages but ""higher benefits"" such as pension as opposed to looking for a different job with higher salary? Obviously it made sense for older employees who started earlier who only contribute 0.8% for the same benefits as new employees.

Second guy told me he fixed it and i would have no problems after putting me on hold for 10 minutes. He wouldnt tell me what he did but said it would be fixed.

My primary concern is whether or not I should contribute to 403b plan. Company offers a max of 5% of my salary.  

Looking to graduate/medical school. Think I could use money better if I had it now versus in retirement. I know I can use it for educational expenses penalty free and I would prob contribute if I know I will get interest on it. I'm assuming I'll be at my job for a max of 2-3 years which is why I think it's just better to have the money now than during retirement.
  
After the 2-3 years, I would be in school for 4 years, then get paid in residency. I think that having the money now is more valuable to me than it would be in retirement where I couldn't touch it (assuming I finish school and am getting paid an average of 45k for 2-4 years in residency).   
   
Could you guys she's some light on this? I'm keep weighing the options and am unsure of what seems best for me. Most threads/info relates to people who plan to work for the rest of their lives. If possible, google 401k gap year and it's the first link that sort of describes my scenario. 
  
Also, since I won't be contributing to it for 4 years or so, I know there may be fees with up keeping the account during that time. I'm not sure if there are fees with this and I'm sure I can move it but I'm assuming that the money made from the interest rate might cover the associated fees. 
  
Question 1: If I do contribute, it would be in vanguard trgt rtrmnt 2055. 1st year is 16.27% for average annual return, since exception is 12.10%.

personalfinance,Am I on the right track? Lifestyle/seasonal worker unsure whether to continue being a bum or get it together.,"Since I find myself in an odd life situation that often has polarizing feedback from friends and family, I figured I'd ask you guys for some advice to get more perspective.

**Here's my situation:**

I'm 27 years old. I work in an industry that I love (rock climbing, tourism) for about 2-3 months a year. Then I do what I love (same) for about 3-4 months a year, prime season, without working, with almost no expenses aside from debt payments during that time (student loans, mortgage). In some ways I'm living the dream - paying off debt, saving some money, and doing what I love. At the same time, I'm not saving much, not paying debt that fast, and obviously carry the ""bum"" stigma (I guess I don't care about that!).

Then, in the off-season, I work for 5-6 months a year, and sublet a place in the city where I work.


**Debts:**

* $11k student loan debt, averaged to 5.7% subsidized federal (just paid off about $1.5k principal. Monthly payment is $60)
* $6k no-interest state student loan debt (monthly payment is $65)
* $44k remaining on a 30-year mortgage @4.65% split with long term girlfriend, monthly payment is about $811. Expensive property tax as it's technically a second home. **The mortgage is *almost* entirely covered by seasonal renters who rent rooms.**
* $2k auto loan, 1.9%, 2001 Toyota Rav-4 with 139k miles. Runs well, will probably average $300 per year in maintenance over the next few years as I replace a few things (I'm a *little bit* handy and a friend has a garage I can use).


**Assets:**

* 401K with about $1k in it. Company automatically provides 3% of my salary.
* Roth IRA with about $8k in it.
* Emergency funds of about six months expenses. 
* **Roughly $5k in savings that I plan on allocating to debt/mortgage/roth IRA**


**Income** 

* is usually around $22-$27k per year. I suppose I'm averaging about 15-25% savings annually, mostly being put in a Roth 401k. 
* Income is about ~$15k-$20k in the offseason with the office gig.
* Income is about ~$5k-$10k in the climbing season.


**Monthly expenses** are about $1500 per month, on average, factoring in higher rent when I sublet in the off-season, and very low rent (paid to my mortgage) during the climbing season.


**I suppose my questions are:**

* where should I allocate my savings?
* am I on the right track for, at the very least, an okay retirement? (I understand the irony as I'm *semi*-retired now...)
* any advice you could give me?
* am I being stupid? I feel like I'm being at least a little stupid.
* I live pretty frugally. I've lived more frugally in the past and I'm not so into it. I've lived more lavishly as well and don't need it. I'm operating pretty cheaply, but I suppose I could always cut costs.

Now we can go about signing this transaction in two ways. One way would be to sign the transaction with both keys at the same time, which is ideal if one entity controls both private keys and it is done like this:

* *signrawtransaction '0100000001b076ce56a394fd507bf55efa32fed382ab59382d7e8948fde044f62348621bb30000000000ffffffff01cf591702000000001976a9147aa972433aa26d74c318f4291e2ae8495fba27ab88ac00000000' '[{""txid"":""b31b624823f644e0fd48897e2d3859ab82d3fe32fa5ef57b50fd94a356ce76b0"",""vout"":0,""scriptPubKey"":""a91450d9ff22c1a625a58132e34b3bf78e7291e504e387"",""redeemScript"":""524104c603c16cbfaf3ead10279f5071815435baf165a721a150c99c3836a2caebd46c7b804b11f8beb5a814694745e643d19ce5cf8e409a83b8a0bb24340b87e87daa410498f6cd258afb6e733498ad9b66559d0fb9889b0fa564cd00e20767a913852260fadb90c5cbc383e445697ecacc656c70151d42501b751e416f7491b07ea0cd9152ae""}]' '[""939AogcuH5Dt8LE54iHrG9wAwSkRrgJCvZYuroxmKJd6RVc1tA1"",""92WVTbrUWyCUvJEABK7xB6PYUdGxJzdVNFhvbukWmNA575hiWXG""]'*

This returns the following hex which is ready to be broadcast:

But what if two separate entities control each private key and they want to sign individually? Both parties would need access to the redeemScript in order to sign the transaction in their own QT consoles and they would also need the txid, the vout number and scriptPubKey of the previous output. If both parties have this information then you would go about it like this. The first party signs with their private key:

Do not let this discourage you. What this really means is that that transaction is not ready to broadcast because it's still missing the signature from the other private key. This hex will not reveal the private key from the first party that signed, so the party that controls the first private key can safely provide the party that controls the second private key with the partially signed transaction hex above so they can sign with their key like this:

I'm 27, have a secure job, rent, contribute to a defined benefit pension plan, and have about $700 left over each month after expenses. I've paid off just over $40,000 of debt in the last 2 years since graduating school (credit card debt from school, then car loan, and then federal student loan) and now have $11,000 remaining in provincial student loan debt at 3%. Should I put all of my extra money towards the loan or contribute to People's Trust's TFSA at 3% so that I have money in the bank and pay off the loan in tandem and be debt free in 1.5 years (I will be contributing 3 extra paychecks to the loan during that time)? I have been facing debt fatigue, so I think that's why I want to focus on savings for a bit and live a bit more freely since the loan won't really be earning interest during that time frame. What are your thoughts? Thanks!",finance,1409089375
personalfinance,Looking to raise my credit score by just a bit...,"Well, actually I'd be happy if I raised it a lot, but here's the deal...

Wife and I have been married for 10 years.  Credit history is clean for at least the past 7 years, no late or missed payments, collections, etc.  We have had a mortgage for the past 5 years.  We want to refinance the house to get a lower rate and a shorter term, as it looks like doing so will save us close to $100k over the next 20 years.

When I spoke with our banker they ran the credit scores to find out what the rate would be, and I was told that I just missed the cutoff for a lower rate.  They say my credit score was 717 (my wife's is 780!), and if mine had been 720 we could have had an even lower rate than she quoted us.  Knowing that it may take a month or two to get the loan together, I'm wondering if there's anything that I can do to bump me up to 720 or higher before locking in my rate.

We each have a car loan.  I am a co-signer on her auto loan (needed to do that to get approved, as I earn several times what she does).  I have a few credit cards with balances, about 60% of my available available credit on them is utilized.  Wife has a few credit cards, all with zero balances.  We have a joint card that is about 80% utilized.

Now the easy part:  I'm getting a bonus this month that will be about $13k after taxes.  We intend to use it to pay off all of my credit cards and the remainder will pay off about half of the joint card, which we expect to completely pay off a few months later.

Even though I'm not sure how they calculate the impact of joint credit into your credit score, I'm still pretty sure that her score is so much higher because of low utilization.  I suspect that paying off my individual cards will bump the score by some undetermined amount, but I've also heard that having too much unused credit available will negatively impact your credit score as well.

So questions are:

1. Will paying off my credit cards give me the three points that I want within the next 30-60 days?
2. Assuming that interest rates stay the same, are we better off waiting until all of the credit cards are paid off before refinancing?
3. Will waiting to close some individual cards until after the refinancing is approved help keep my score from going down?
4. Will paying off too much of my debt all at once lower my score?
5. Is there some optimum strategy for paying this down that will boost my credit score the most?

financialindependence,One loan to rule them all?,"I'm 32 years old, married and have only just begun to be able to save up for retirement. I'm bogged down with student loans at various interest rates. Within the past 2 years my wife and I were able to increase our incomes to a higher tax bracket. This is a gift and a curse as the interest in our student loans can't be written off during tax season for nearly as much as they used to be able to.

We wonder if a sizable private loan encompassing all our college debt at a set interest rate would be a good idea. On the plus side, it would be one bill a month instead of the 8 or so checks we need to write. On the negative side, we don't know what this would do to our credit score.

One small caveat is that some of my wife's loans are currently under Chapter 11 bankruptcy status and can't be accessed for a few years.  Her father, who co-signed her loans, had to file for divorce which left his financial situation in shambles, causing him to file Chapter 11 and for some reason, even though my wife was the main recipient of the loans, they locked them away.

Any advice? Thanks in advance.",finance,1409092422
investing,Whole life vs direct investing,"/r/Investing, I need some assistance evaluating the merits of some statements made regarding whole life insurance vs term+direct investing. Specifically, I was involved in [this discussion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ej5nj/is_whole_life_right_for_me/ck0n82w?context=3) in /r/personalfinance, and I'm not enough of an expert on whole life to determine whether the following statements are complete BS or contain some shred of credibility.

http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ej5nj/is_whole_life_right_for_me/ck15wq2

&gt; The most efficient use of a life insurance policy is not for the cash value, it's the death benefit. Comparing the cash value accumulation in a policy to an index fund is a poor comparison. The cash value is nice: a feature on your plan you can use if you need immediate cash funds tax free. The real purpose is for the death benefit, which yields a higher rate of return.

http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ej5nj/is_whole_life_right_for_me/ck15rg6

&gt; The face value of the life insurance policy is the death benefit guarantee. If you buy a $100,000 death benefit, you are guaranteed to get that amount when you die. However, mutual insurance companies pay dividends, and the death benefit grows as the company pays dividends. The IRR on a policy, based on the 2014 dividend scale, will be around 5% at life expectancy for a 30 year old male. That's net of all fees and taxes. So, unless the insurance company never pays dividends, the insured's beneficiary will receive way more than $100,000.

&gt; That's really close in terms of IRR to what the Vanguard Total Market index fund returned over the past 15 years, but with zero market risk and no taxes, computed while risk assets are close to their peak.
Also, don't forget that risk assets, particularly equities, have been poor investments for long stretches of time. Whole life in the 80's outperformed risk assets by a wide margin, because it was a high interest rate environment. There is a very real possibility that as interest rates rise the indexes will not perform as they have in the past 30 years. This doesn't mean that you don't buy mutual funds, but it does mean that you should probably hedge this assets with less risk.

personalfinance,"How do I figure out how much money I should be using toward student loans, a savings account, and a vangard account?","I recently found out I have a large student loan in my name. Several months ago my parents offered to consume my student loan debt as a huge and amazing present to me. I was extremely thankful and gave them all the information to have the loans transferred to their names. They did consume one of the loans, but I was recently contacted by the other loan asking why I haven't made payments. Turns out this loan has gone unpaid the majority of this year, and that my parents can't afford to consume that loan, so it is still in my name and has so far been ruining my credit. Oh boy.

---

Here is all the info you might need:

* I am 23 years old and dropped out of college halfway through my expensive private education.

* Currently making wildly different amounts of money every month. I work an hourly part-time job and do a bunch of random stuff on the side. Let's just say **I currently make about $1800/month.**

* I am hoping to go full-time at my job and get a raise with it. I am expecting to be making about $3000/month soon (but hoping for more!). I don't know when this will start. It could be a few months.

* The loan is a direct stafford loan for $8,179.89 with a fixed interest rate of 6.55%. 

* Rent and bills comes out to **$500/month.**

* I am pretty frugal in my lifestyle. I rarely go out drinking, but I do like to go out to eat about once or twice a week (probably $100/month). I don't know what I spend on groceries (maybe $200-300/month?). I don't spend money on hair, makeup, or razors, so the cost of being female is negligible. I only buy used clothes and items, but probably end up spending around $50-$100/month on shopping at thrift stores. I also have three pets -- a dog, a cat, and a snake. I honestly don't know how much I spend on them a month. Probably around $100 on all their food combined. Plus I pay $10/month to a nonprofit, $10/month to Spotify, and $130/month on car insurance, and probably $150/month on gas. I bought my car with cash so I don't have any additional payments on that. So if I round all that up, I spend about **$900/month on lifestyle.**

* I have a vanguard account with about $1500 sitting in it, but I haven't added anything to it in a long time.

* I recently opened a savings account that probably has a few hundred dollars in it. I just add to it when I am feeling generous to myself, but it is hidden from my view so that I act like it doesn't exist. I don't have any particular use for this in my mind, so let's just say this is the beginning of my emergency fund.

* After I pay rent on the 1st, I'll probably have around $1500 in my checking account. 

* I have fucking terrible credit. I don't remember my credit score, and I'm too scared to look. All I know is this loan went unpaid for a very long time. I had a maxed out credit card when I was 18 that went unpaid for like 5 months, which I then paid off in full and closed. Also from when I was 18, I had a pretty expensive emergency room visit that I never paid. I now have a secured line of credit through my credit union that I pay $28/month on as an effort to build some of this credit back up. 

* Even though I'm young and love to travel, I don't have a travel fund. I rent out my house once or twice a year and use that money to travel.

**To summarize, I have about $300/month extra if I am rounding up and don't cut costs any more. Should I be paying $300/month on my student loans? Should I be paying less? Should I try to pay more? What about my savings account? What about my vangard account? And how about when I start making $3000/month?**

*Edit* - Currently I'm paying $95/month on my student loan. I'm not sure what the minimum is. I would like my student loan payments to be automated, so hopefully I can figure out a number to stick with long term, rather than give various amounts each month.

*Edit 2* - Also, with the new federal loan laws, could I just pay the minimum (which would likely stretch the loan out over longer than 10 years), and therefore not have to pay as much in the end?",finance,1409099790

I still had fun with friends, rode my bike, and did all the fun things kids enjoy but had some financial ambition was all. It didn't get nurtured and I ended up badly in debt in my early 20's. I'm doing well now, but it took so many more years to climb out of some bad choices than it took to get into them. Influence from others was a HUGE factor.

news,Car Loan Calculator - Best solution for calculating loan,"Car Loan Calculator was necessary for the most at the time of financing the automobile during the loan. The vehicle advance calculator is required to calculate the total amount value to be repaid every month along with the noticeable rate. The interest charge and the amount of the interest are calculated with the help of the advance calculator. The amount during financing must be calculated correct or it may rotate into loss to either of the social gathering. The loan hunter before making an agreement must calculate the installment to be paid every month and the interest rate on the amount of loan. The calculation has to be correct to assure a good deal.
Countless lenders offer people finance to permit them to purchase a new or a used vehicle. The lenders are on an equal playing field and present potential customers competitive loans. Some main factors to be thought about when taking a car loan is the interest rate because it is a major contributor to how much you will have to repay each month. There are other factors that determine the overall cost of your loan that you will have to take into consideration in finding the best cheap auto loan.

Using Car Loan Calculator
Using a vehicle finance calculator is really easy. You just need to enter the rate of interest being offered to you by the lender, the term of the loan in months, the total cost of the automobile being bought, and down payment (if any). The calculator will display an estimated monthly payment that you will have to pay for the offer under consideration. Comparing numerous loan offers without a van credit calculator can be really difficult and time consuming, especially if you are not good at mathematics.
One can only think of the advantages of a vehicle loan calculator, above all, for persons not sure as to how greatly a vehicle lend will essentially cost them. In the most recent few years, travel has persisted to intensify on our roads and one of the main reasons is the lending role that van loan companies have played.

Here are some general kinds of automobile mortgage calculators and see which works best for your car finance needs. New Car Loan Calculator helps  you work out your ideal monthly payments. A lot of new car finance calculators can be used for a variety of uses like used auto loans. With this calculator, you can usually enter your own interest rate for your loan.

She is currently going back to school part time to get a bachelor's degree in business. After lengthy chats with her, I uncovered the extent of her debt. Below is a breakout:

&gt;Student Loans: $65,000 (she'll be graduating in another 2 years and this is the expected combo of federal and private loans)

&gt;Credit Card: $8,000

&gt;Medical: $4,000


Right now she doesnt have much income and is focusing on her credit card bills with the highest interest rates. Unfortunately, since she took our private loans for school nearly a decade ago when she started her degree, she now has to make monthly payments to Sallie Mae. She wants to plan a wedding now, but I think that is an unwise financial move, given the weight of her financials.

I was just reading through the old posts and there was so much content that I ran out of time before finding what I was looking for - so sorry if this is a repost. 

At the start of the year I had about $10k in credit card debt at a 13.99% interest rate.  I got a new card with 1 year at 0% and paid off all my debt (Whoo!).  I'm in real estate and have about $800/mo in revolving expenditures that are pretty unavoidable (gas, advertising, office fees, etc).  I'm paying it off automatically every month so I'd like to find a card that works for me.  I was thinking one of these items:

1.) Cash back on certain items - I spend about $150-200/mo on gas and probably $100-150 on groceries, so I could potentially benefit more than most from this. 
2.) A southwest card that gives me points for spending money.  I like to keep all my work expenses on a credit card so it's easy to track and use for taxes. I also want to travel more now that I'm out of debt but don't have kids yet.
3.) Something else...dunno. 

I don't know what cards to be looking at for cash back.  And are airline points even worth it?  I think I would travel more if I had points v. having extra money in savings. 

Also, I have a few old credit cards lying around (my old 13.99% one, a gap one, a belk's one).  Is it okay to leave them open or should I be working to close all of them?  It's not really a credit issue with me but more of a safety issue in my mind.

personalfinance,Outside of the FHA 203K loan - what are my options for buying a house and immediately doing renovations?,"It seems the standard is the FHA 203K loan if I want to buy a home and immediately do some renovations to it however I also know that it's a longer process then a traditional mortgage, lots of red tape, and interest rates can be quite high. I'm also trying to avoid doing an immediate home equity loan as these repairs are cosmetic and not structural.

Essentially my price range is between 250-300, however these homes are generally larger then what I need although they do have the land that I'm looking for. I have found numerous smaller homes that are more towards the size we want/need and I get more land utilization which is important to me - the only problem is, these homes haven't been updated and are quite outdated (think the baby blue tiled bathroom, 1980s kitchens, etc.) where as the higher priced homes are updated. 

My immediate thought is to take one of the cheaper homes and immediately higher a contractor to update some portions of the house that require it before moving in , then start updating the other areas as needed as my time/skill allows after we move in. However, I'm having a hard time figuring out how I would do this as the home equity loan and FHA 203K loan are the two options I've found.

Does anyone have any experience with doing this, or other loan options available? Any other advice from past experience doing this would also be appreciated.",finance,1409150233

(US)","So in 2011 my car died, and I had to get a car, no option &amp; this dealership took advantage of a young kid that didn't know much about cars and the financial world of loans. ... yes, I do blame myself for this, but at the same time, I needed a car right then and there and only had a monetary amount of money to put down.  Also noting that I had just moved cross country solo for work with no friend/family.  So there was that added pressure.

Long story short, I bought a Kia Optima 2009, payments are $327/mth, with an interest rate of ... hold your breath, 25.99%.  With a loan amount of $11,767.86.  My balance is only showing $10,114.64... and it's been 3yrs!  This all due to that damn interest.  It was on a 72mth loan term, but due to a lovely sexual harassment issue in CA.  And my company, sweeping it under the floor and ""letting me go"" with... the very nominal relocation package to go back cross country... and search for a new job.  I had to push back the loan term to 75mths.

I'm making less now, and working 2 jobs &amp; still unable to cover the $327 monthly payments with all the other bills I have accruing.  And by bills I mean bare minimum, rent, electric, car insurance, gas for car, and minimal food (ramen and pb/j).  No cable or internet (phone is lucky covered by wrk.

So with a High Interest Rate, and I am owing 3 months behind in payments, bad credit.  What are some suggestions for refinancing.

I checked Kelly Blue Book - the car seems to be valued somewhere around $7,500-$8,000 ... so it's worth less than I owe at this point.  So I don't think trying to get rid of it is an option.

Please help, if the payments were at what they were when my lender gave me an adjusted or assisted rate (i.e. - $127 for a 6mth only, 1 time per the length of the loan... though that is not what the rep. told me over the phone... he stated I could reapply, the month after it expired.  Now I find out Santander, destroyed the audio recording supposedly 30days after I agreed verbally to that contract.  Additionally, that signed contract to those same terms, says nothing of this supposed 1x per lifetime of the loan amount.  ...but what can I do.  I supposed it is at this point hearsay, and that is how 'they' get you.  The corporation gets you, as I have been screwed over many times by 'the man'... I suppose I am just getting you to it.  It is just the damn way of the world now, and we all just roll over to it now.

The salesman came to her with the price on 2 different cars she looked at.  He said he could do $14,000 for both of them.  She said ""ok, I'll take both""  He reiterated, the price $14,000 each so that would be $28,000.  And she said, ""yeah, cause I'm gonna take the one, and give the other to my daughter""

... It wasn't so much that she said it, it was her tone... it was so lazy... so laxed &amp; nonchalant.  And, no... even if I had money available... the sort of person that just wafts there funds around so casually like they are only spending a quarter on a car, I would still react the same.  Cars cost money... REAL money, if I had a HUGE Surplus of funds, I would not speak in this tone.  I would not lower the value of a dollar just because I had more of them.

Groceries/Eating out: $275

Netflix: $8

Washer &amp; Dryer/Pets/Acne Meds: $60

Savings: $75 (I have $10,000 in my e-fund, which is why I have started paying more to my car loan. I also have $2,000 in savings in case I have an immediate need for cash)

Everything Else: $400 (I have a budget for ""everything else"" in Mint that includes things like gifts, car repair/service, hair cuts, random things)

Total Expenses: $3,216
Total Income: $3,600
Difference: $384

Now, I don't always make my budget. I get within +- $300 most months. I really struggle with the food budget and the shopping budget, as I am trying to build my wardrobe with quality pieces, instead of shopping at crappy mall stores. I also buy a lot of things for the gym - protein powder, supplements, a new weightlifting belt, etc. But let's pretend that I make my $200 budget every month, and I am working to bring it down.

I feel like I spend WAY too much money. I hate having a car payment, but I like having a reliable car with good gas mileage. I could sell it for maybe $10,000, but then I'm in the hole for 2 grand and I still have to buy another car. 

I only have Comcast in my area, and this is the cheapest plan they will give me. It does include HBO, which is cool, but unnecessary. Even without HBO, it's the same price.

I guess my issue is the ""everything else"" category. I don't know how to save for these random/semi-annual expenses. Sure, Mint has a handy little suggestion box ""You spend about $6/month on hair cuts"" but I don't find it's useful, since I might service my car once a year for $300. 

I have $7,500 in an IRA, which I rolled over from an old 401k. In my new 401k, I have about $400. I am planning to leave my current job in the next 4 weeks, and don't know how long it will be before I can contribute to my next 401k. Assuming it takes 2 weeks to increase my 401k contribution, I will MAYBE get one paycheck in before I leave.

So my questions are:

1) Should I bother putting $100/month in my IRA, ON TOP OF what I put in my 401k? 

2) How do I budget for the ""everything else"" expenses? I've been using Mint for 2 years, I've tried having 2401 budgets for every individual category, but it's a pain and not helpful.

investing,Guidance for 24 year old on the path to financial freedom,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to borrow some guidance for what path to take to achieve my goals of eventually owning a home and eventual financial freedom. 

- 24 y.o. in DC Metro Area making $65,000 annually 

- Taking advantage of 401K up to 6% employer match. Current balance is $10K

- $25K in savings, $8K in investments (will break these down below)

- $17K left in car payments, 1.99% interest rate (paying extra towards principal every month)

- Roughly $5K in student loans will begin to need payment in about 1 year (after graduation)

- Moving out from home in a week. Rent will be roughly $900 for my portion per month 

$8K in investments breakdown (rounded figures below):

- $4K in Vanguard 2050 Target Fund (not using for retirement, but rather as an easy diversified option for stocks/bonds)

- $1,100 in AAPL

- $700 in BBRY

- $900 in F

- $500 in FNMA 

- $900 in SGLB (my hail Mary stock pick)

- $100 in UNG

I've struggled with my stock choices and have not been able to make good gains consistently. I think I'd like to invest more in funds such as Vanguards. But, which ones?

I don't need $25K in cash sitting around. I think the best choice would be to invest most of it. But again, in which funds or where? I will own a home, but not for at least a few years so I can avoid PMI and also to stay mobile for the early stages of my career. 

Any advice out there? Thanks for reading.",finance,1409164111
personalfinance,"Given $10,000 today. No idea what to do with it.","Hello /r/personalfinance, in celebration of my newest child I was given $10,000 from a wealthy family member. I admit that I am terrible with financial things as I prefer not to think about it. My wife normally handles things but as she is a redditard I'm doing the research.


**The Background**

* My wife and I are 26 years old
* I am an E4 in the U.S. Army, she is unemployed
* I have a newborn son and a two year old daughter
* I plan to stay in the Army and retire *or* get out after finding a good job with a degree I am working on now
* I am using tuition assistance to get a bachelors degree (free if I do well), I plan on transferring my GI Bill to my wife if that pans out

**The Goals**

* I'd like to have a college fund for my two children if they plan to attend
* Pay off debt
* Have some sort of retirement fund. I'm not familiar with the Army options
* Decent savings and emergency fund

*I understand these goals are not immediately attainable or feasible in the near future with this amount of money*


**The Black**

* Approx $3,000 in savings
* Approx $1,000 in checking
* $10,000 check

**The Red**

* Approx $1,000 in credit card debt
* Approx $9,000 in student loans (have been doing minimum payment forever, interest rate of 6.55%)
* The usual recurring bills including a 3 year car lease (payment is $356 a month with about a year and a half left on the lease)

*I do not pay rent per se or have a utility bill as I live on an Army post*

I have financial resources available to me through various Army programs (which I will pursue) but I literally just received the check and wanted to see what you lovely folk have to say. Sorry for the big post.",finance,1409168612
personalfinance,"So, what's next?","Wondering what I should do next in personal finance or if someone can recommend some good literature for people who don't need the ""get out of debt"", ""raise your credit score"", and ""learn to budget"" lessons anymore.


Here's my situation:

I have a sizable 401k, ROTH IRA, and taxable brokerage account.  I contribute the max federally allowed to my ROTH and 401k every year.  I have 6 months worth of 'bill' savings which includes my average discretionary.  I have school loans and a house loan, but the rates are so low on the school loan that I'm actually making more money from the taxable account by not paying off the loans.  I have no car payment and my car is in good condition.  My house payment is not self sustaining like my school loan, but I like having liquidity and don't want to pay off my house.

My question again:

What else should I be doing?  Just wait?  Are there other financial things I could do with my excess cash other than just stuff it in a savings account?  Every other option (CDs, Savings, Bonds) just seem to pale in comparison to the money I'm making in my taxable brokerage account... but that can't be all there is, is there?",finance,1409170323

I am looking to purchase a home in Brampton, Ontario - My Wife and I found one we like. We have listed our current home and expect to make between 100K (On the absolute Low end). The new home we were looking at will cost us between 860-950k (Depending on the Lot we select). The build time is approix 2 years, which provides me some time to save up another 100-150K (will be living with my parents during this time)

My Salary is approix 140K (Contract)
Wife Salary is about 70K (FT)
My only major expense at the moment besides life insurance $300/month, is my car $420/month
Wife's only Major Expense would be her car payments $720/month

Questions:
1) Is buying a NEW Construction home a good investment if I live there for 10-15 years? (Brampton Area, near Mississauga Road and Sandlewood or Creditview Road and Williams Parkway
2) Is this the right time to buy? Prices of home seem to be quite high right now, and I am a bit worried that prices of homes will decrease as interest rates start going back up. With interest rates gradually rising, should I expect there to be more homes on the market. (I can imagine a lot of individuals bought homes when interest rates were low, and as they start rising up in the next few years they may no longer be able to afford their homes. Which would create a buyers market, and likely causing prices of homes to decrease.",finance,1409181097

Bitcoin,"Will Bitcoin reach $1,000,000 some day? (financial models)","So, I ran some finance calculations, and:

If bitcoin value goes to $10,000 and stays there forever, but USD keeps inflating at 3% every year, Bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000 in 150 years (but $1mil will only buy what $10k buys today)

If Bitcoin value goes up and stays at $10,000, but USD keeps inflating at the rate it has over the last few years, bitcoin will be worth $1mil in just 67 years.

Keep in mind that I picked the $10,000 figure as a conservative estimate of BTC capturing only 0.5% of the world's cash amount.

Now let's say inflation is at a slightly higher rate that the target, at 4% a year, which is I think reasonable with the increased spending, debt obligations, and possibly continuing troubles in the global economy (it's just 1% higher than the Fed's 3% target), and Bitcoin grows at an average rate of stock at 10% a year. Meaning instead of growing to $10,000 (or 0.5% of use) and staying there, it actually continues to grow, with 10% more people adopting it every year. In this case, Bitcoin will be worth $1mil in 56 years, at which point it will be worth about $100,000 in today's dollars, having a market cap of about $1.7 trillion dollars. I don't know what percentage of the total world wealth that will be, since we don't know how much the world economy will expand by then.

If inflation is the same 4%, but bitcoin grows at the same average rate it has over the last few years, about 2x to 3x, or, say, 250%, it will reach $1mil in just 5.9 years, where its worth will be $810,000 per coin. HOWEVER, if that happens, it will have a market cap of about $11 trillion dollars, which tells me that it's pretty much not possible for bitcoin to consistently double or triple every year for the next 6 years. (Sorry latecomers, you may still have a massive return, but that are not many of those left)

So, where about is a reasonable number? No one knows, especially since bitcoins growth is expected to be rapid over the next few years, then level off to something more sustainable years from now, and dollars will continue to decline. While I can set up such a model, the extra detail provided by the variables will not counter the fact that all these numbers are coming out of my ass.

Using 3.5% inflation, and 40% annual bitcoin growth (very reasonable, considering Small Cap stocks give 16%, and we're talking global adoption for currency, transactions, and investments here), gives us a $1million Bitcoin in 21 years, with bitcoin market cap of $8 trillion dollars, which right now is maybe half of all the world's wealth, but 20 years from now may be a fairly small (reasonably believable) part of it.

So there you have it folks. About 20 years for bitcoin to hit $1,000,000, if bitcoin continues being adopted and doesn't fail or get replaced along the way (with an error rate of +\- 10 years).

I am about 6 months away from graduating from college (Bachelor's). I'm 22. I've held quite a few part time jobs during college, so I have decently sized chunk of money that is sitting in my savings account gathering dust and doing no work for me.

I am not worried about student loan debt, as they are not high interest loans, and I plan on paying them off over 5-7 years.

My question is: how can I start making my money work for me? I'd like to start investing my money so that I can get a decent rate of return, but I'm not sure exactly how to go about this. I'm looking for something that will not require much research over time on my part (so no investing in individual stocks). Would this mean looking into ETFs or MFs? Should I use investment tools offered by my bank or seek other alternatives? I've written bonds off for now because interest rates only have one way to go right now (up), which would mean buying bonds at the moment would not be a good idea.

As for retirement, I'm thinking of opening up a traditional IRA account. However, I will most likely be employed full time within the year after college, so should I just wait for the 401(k) option? Is it okay to have both an IRA and 401(k)? How do the transfers work between IRA and 401(k)?

And I mean from her personal savings, not a parent PLUS loan or something like that.

So I'm aware of some implications of having a student loan, such as certain tax deductions, and I'm wondering whether this changes anything.  If we treat it like a federal student loan such that I only borrow up to the school's official Cost of Attendance and I only spend it on the allowed expenses (tuition, fees, housing, etc.), can I claim it on my taxes like any other student loan?  Are the above limitations necessary?

And are there any other implications I'm not seeing here?

**Utilities:** $100 (I don't know how much this should be)


**Student loans:** $150 (that's the lowest I want to pay. If I can afford to pay it off quicker I will)


**Car loan:** $200 (I have this through a credit union which takes out $500 from my regular account, applies $200 to the loan and the rest is saved. That money is my ""pretend it's not there"" money. I like that it's in a different account than my checking and saving)


**Health insurance:** free (dad says I can stay on his insurance because it doesn't cost him anything with me staying or not. I'm 22)


**Car insurance:** $75 (on my dad's plan but I might have to get my own eventually)


**Gas and repairs:** $230 (I have a used hybrid so gas isn't much. I plan on getting an apartment within 15 min drive to work. The rest will be saved for future repairs) 


**Food:** $300


**Clothing and other odds and ends:** $100 


**Entertainment:** $200 (including gym and other activities) 



Naturally I will save as much as I can from these categories. I would like to know if this is reasonable and where I can cut down the most.

news,COULD A FERGUSON HAPPEN IN LOUISIANA?,"Thursday, August 28th, 2014
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

                 COULD A FERGUSON HAPPEN IN LOUISIANA?

Is the Ferguson, Missouri community unique in its inability to deal with a troubling death with still unanswered questions?  Of course not. Ferguson is any town when reason disintegrates into the chaos of aggressive confrontation. 

Ferguson is not a community in decay or a broken ghetto as some news outlets have portrayed it.  It will surprise many of my Louisiana readers to learn that I attended high school in Ladue, a small community right next to Ferguson, and to know that I regularly made the fifteen-minute drive there for weekend dates.  The racial demographics have changed, but the town is still made up of working class neighborhoods that continue to sprawl throughout St. Louis County.


That’s not to say that Ferguson is the safest place to be roaming about.  The Wall Street Journal reports, “the city has 190 crimes per square mile, compared with a national median of 39.3.  If you live in Ferguson, you are twice as likely to have your car stolen or get mugged, or have your house broken into than if you live in Averageville, U.S.A.”  Kind of makes you feel right at home if you happen to live in New Orleans.

Louisiana communities, by comparison, have been relatively peaceful.  Racial confrontations in Jena back in 2007, and in New Orleans following Katrina come to mind.  Although the Bayou State has a proliferation of crime significantly above the national average, racial calm has generally prevailed.  And give the devils their due.  Politicians, particularly out of the state capitol, may be incapable of balancing the state budget, and solving a long list of quality of life problems.  But racial strife has been minimized by active mayors and other officials both black and white, who have been fairly successful at defusing potential racial confrontations.


In the Ferguson crisis, no one comes out in a positive light.  No one.  Guilt and innocence is determined on television, as one rumor after the other is reported as fact.  Typical was MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, who tweeted out: “I think the security problem in Ferguson is not solvable through policing. Until charges are brought against Wilson, this will go on.”  Wilson was the police officer who fired the shots that killed Brown.  So much for any fair investigation taking place.

Democratic Governor Jay Nixon jumped to pre judge by calling for the “vigorous prosecution” of Wilson.  Attorney General Eric Holder had no problem immediately jumping into this local dispute by sending in 40 FBI agents, and demanding a third autopsy on Brown.   He traveled to Ferguson to lament about his personal experiences in not believing the police.  The New York Times quoted Holder as telling locals in Ferguson that “he could understand mistrust that many young blacks felt towards the police.”  More pre judgment. As for the President?  He has just stayed put on the golf course.

The Mayor and county officials loaded up with military weapons and armored vehicles to create an atmosphere of a war zone.  Far from defusing the crisis, their actions just poured more fuel on the escalating fire.

Ferguson is 67% black, but the Mayor, the chief of police, and 5 of the 6 council members are white, and local African Americans claim an unfair radical balance.  But these white officials were elected by this majority black city.  Elections have consequences, and voting results show a lack of black participation.  If you don’t go to the polls, you have only your self to blame.

Michael Brown told his family a few weeks before his death that he saw the face of God and “now I believe.”  Then he went ahead and robbed a convenience store of cigars and ruffed up the clerk.  Let’s just say he was no angel.

And we have not heard a peep from the shooter, Officer Darren Wilson.  The failure of the Ferguson police department to give out Wilson’s side on just what happened is troubling to those who want to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Like so many of these racial confrontations including Watts, Jena, Rodney King, O.J., Travon Martin and many others, this too shall pass. There is a leadership quotient that is missing in Ferguson.  Chaos and confusion has to be addressed by community leadership way before confrontation happens.  

Every city and state can make mistakes.  But Louisiana seems to have gotten it right far more often than other parts of the country. Ferguson, as it goes forward, could well learn a lesson.

personalfinance,"I'm about to make my first mortgage payment. Should I overpay vigorously, or put the extra money in index funds?","I have a 15 year mortgage to the tune of $110K. The interest rate is 3.5%. I'm not really planning on staying at this place for a full 15 years.

I also have about $20K in index funds and an IRA. So far, my rate of return is about 5%.

My question is if it's better to overpay the mortgage, taking into account that I'll probably only be here ~3 years (and thus wouldn't reap the full savings of paying the mortgage off earlier), AND the opportunity cost of not investing as much in index funds.

After ~3 years, I suppose I would have more equity in the property. But It probably won't grow in value as much as the index funds, at least I don't expect it to.

My intuition is that overpayment is better, but I'm unsure.",finance,1409261959
personalfinance,Is this idea for paying my student loans?,"I received this idea from a friend and want other opinions on it before I make a decision on what to do.

BACKSTORY: My wife and I currently make roughly $160K a year pretax, that's the total for both of us. We owe about about $90K in student loans (PRIVATE SCHOOL WHY WHY WHY?!?!?!). We have consolidated our loans to lower the interest rate to between 4.5% - 6.5% and are only paying the minimum. This means we will have some loans for 10-15 more years!!! Yikes :o After taxes each month we bring about 8K in a month and about we spend about $4200 (rent, 2 car payments, food, utilities, gas, etc...) each month. Then an extra $900 towards student loans. So in all $5100 of our $8000 is a must spend. Yes, I know we could spend less, but that's not my question and I am happy knowing at any moment I can easily put back around $3k in the bank on any given month. With that being said please inform me if you think the idea below is wise or not.

Thanks for any help you may give!!!

Below is the idea from my friend:


The way a 401(k) is set up, when you normally withdraw from it before you turn 59 ½, you have to pay income taxes on the amount you withdraw, plus an additional 10% early withdrawal tax. However, you can take out a loan from your 401(k) instead, assuming you already haven’t, and the penalty and income taxes don’t apply. It works just like any other loan, except when you leave your employer, the entire loan, plus interest, is due immediately, and you pay income and penalty taxes.

With that in mind, the plan is simple:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions (right now it’s $17,500/yr) until you have enough saved up to pay your loan in one go.

2. Take out a 401(k) loan and use it to pay off your loans.

3. Continue life as normal, paying your 401(k) (i.e., future Chris), instead of Nelnet/Sallie Mae/literally Hitler.

4. ???

5. Profit

In a nutshell, you’re borrowing money from yourself in the future, to buy back your debt today. Then you get to pay yourself back, and that feels way more satisfying.

But that’s just icing on the cake – here are the main benefits:

* The initial payments (but not loan repayments) into your 401(k) are taken before taxes, so you’ll drop into a lower income bracket, which will save money.

* Your loan repayments don’t count towards the 401(k) annual contribution limit, so you can contribute more than otherwise possible.

* The money in your 401(k), if invested well, will grow with the market, so you can build up the initial funds faster than a savings account, saving you student loan interest.

I should point out that potential interest is lost when you take out the loan, since it’s not in the market anymore. This is offset by your savings on student loan interest, and can be mitigated by maxing your annual contribution and paying the loan back quickly. The faster you get your principal and its interest back into the market, the faster it starts making money for you again. That’s the ins-and-outs of it, for the most part. The key takeaway is that it’s high-risk, medium-reward, and gratification is very delayed.",finance,1409262048
personalfinance,15 year mortgage vs 30 year mortgage paid early,"Ok, so I know that if I get a 30 year mortgage, I am paying a ton of interest over the lifetime of it. I have often heard of people making extra payments towards the principal in order to pay it off sooner and to avoid paying some of the interest.
However, the lower monthly payments of the 30 year mortgage are appealing, because you never know if you might fall on hard times in the future.

Basically I am just wondering whats the difference between getting a 15 year mortgage, and getting a 30 year mortgage that I pay off in 15 years, assuming a $150,000 loan at current interest rates.

 B.) transfers to a department that has nothing to deal with my internet issue (they sent me to wireless a few times).


I eventually got fed up and just started calling Corporate and harassing them on Twitter. At least I can understand them there. I was scheduled for this past Saturday, awesome!

Questions include: 


The definition of application does not include loan term or product type.  What if a consumer submits the six elements listed in the rule, but does not specify the type of product or term?


What if the consumer starts filing out an online application and saves it with the six pieces of information entered, but has not yet submitted it to the creditor?


May an online application system reject applications submitted by a consumer that contain the six elements of an application because other preferred information is not included?


Do the new disclosure requirements apply to assumptions?


For seller Closing Disclosures that are provided on a separate document by the settlement agent pursuant to § 1026.38(t)(5) and § 1026.19(f)(4), are creditors required to collect and retain documents related to the seller that were provided only to the settlement agent?


Is owner’s title insurance not required by the creditor subject to the 10% cumulative tolerance?


Does the 7-day waiting period before consummation that applies to Loan Estimates apply to revised disclosures?


Are creditors required to provide revised Loan Estimates on the same business day that a consumer or loan officer requests a rate lock?  § 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D).

Monthly Principal and Interest at $342.84  
Total Monthly Payment - $440.49

Currently I've been renting it out at $550 with no issues, it is a location that I feel confident will continue to be easy to rent out, etc.

My question is on the mortgage amortization debate: I've been paying down the principal by $100 for a few months, because from what I understand that's best practice. However, I'm curious what your thoughts are on theory. 

Here's what I've calculated:  
$1200/year towards principal  
Reduces term by 9.7 years resulting in a savings of $19,910 in interest  
However, that is 16.2 years of paying $1200 a year, which is $19,200ish.

I realize that paying it down early also means 9.7 years of no payment, resulting in ~$47,520 in saved monthly payments.

I know you're thinking 'well yeah, pay it off is way better' - but I'm curious in terms of taking that $1200 and putting it towards my IRA, over the long term if I do that will I earn more than the 50k+ I'll pay in the traditional mortgage during the next 27 years?

I'm also wondering about general depreciation/inflation. In say, 20 years, will $440 still be $440? Unlikely. So, with that in mind as well I'm just curious what you guys have to say!

I realize I could just be going in circles and that paying down principal is always the right move, I'm just curious like at which point does it stop being worth it? Do I pay more, less, etc.? I can pay much more right now towards the principal, but that's equity in a home and it gets tied up and while I'm confident I can keep renting, I'm not as confident I would be able to sell it when the time comes.

I'll stop going around and around and see what yall have to say =) Thanks!",finance,1409284984
personalfinance,Reddit I need financial help!,"I probably have around 400-500 dollars in collection. Its been there for over a year. My credit score is horrible at this point. I am going to pay it off this month. I want too immediately start working on increasing it. As I plan on buying a new car in 20 months. (Yes I know its a long ways ahead but the time will fly by) 

  Anyways on to my questions now! Will 20 months be enough time to bring up my credit score?  Will it bring it up enough to the point that I will not pay some monstrous interest rate? Will I even be able get it up enough to even be approved for a loan? Sorry for not being able to provide my actual score. I do not know it. 

  I also plan on getting a credit card. I keep seeing people say that a secured credit card is the way to go if you have bad credit.
However my question is will they approve me no matter what? I don't want to bump my score down more just to apply and get denied. I need a credit card that will guarantee approval. If that is possible?

personalfinance,Joint Loan Question (Auto Loan),"So me and my fiancee are getting married in about a month. Her credit score is very good from some mistakes when she was younger (she didn't really have anyone to teach her finances), she's gotten rid of all of her debt. Still her credit score has kinda remained a good bit scarred.

So when she got her auto loan the interest rate wasn't great. So were getting married and mine is 720 ish.

That being said what are my options. Right now we do the split finance thing, so we both contribute to a joint account for all of our bills (besides cars that we pay out of our own personal accounts).

Is there a good way for her to refinance in both of our names (If so will it use the highest credit score? or would it absolutely need to be in my name?)

If we did that, could I then remove myself from it? (in case god forbid we got divorced or something)

What are my options? The car itself maybe has like 7-8k left on it (it was a used car for about 10k). But she would still be responsible for the payments, but I figured they would be much less if she had a better interest rate.

personalfinance,Considering a loan from my 401k,"I'm 32 years old and I've made some mistakes in the last few years that have gotten me pretty deep in credit card debt - about $10,000.  I have a good job and have been able to continue contributing to my 401k (maxing out my employer's matching) and I think I am getting myself into pretty good shape.  My 401k plan allows for a loan to be withdrawn at a pretty low interest rate (4.25 vs ~18-20 on my credit cards).  The loan re-payments get pulled directly from your paycheck and the interest actually is paid to me (it goes directly into my 401k).  I've also confirmed that I can continue to make my usual contributions and get my employer matching while my loan is being paid back.  I'm estimating that if I borrowed $10000 that I could manage getting it paid back within 2 years and my 401k would continue to grow during that time since I am still able make my usual contributions.  The only bad thing I can see is that $10000 won't be making any money during that two years (aside from the interest that I am paying) but I'd still have 80% of my annual salary left in there, and like I said - I can continue to make contributions.

personalfinance,Ambitious College Student Seeking to Start a Business w/ Debt. Lots of Debt.,"Alright Personal Finance, please allow me a fair amount of leeway, as I am rising from the shadows to finally post here in PF.

Overview: I'm a soon-to-be graduate and want to start up a business I feel appeals to current trends in a broad sense as well as localized wants. However, I am looking to graduate with $60,995 in student debt (which I can break down upon request). I'm looking for advise on what to do when coming out of the gates of graduation and prioritizing of this project/career in regards to my personal finance needs.

First, I have kept up with and began implementing budget monitoring techniques that will help alleviate the stress of my financial student debt. As stated, the amount of financial burden is $61,000. One-third of this debt comes from federal loans (all Stafford Loans) whereas the rest comes from (private) state loans (6.8% interest). I have planned to live at home for a year and a half while attempting to land a $28,000+ entry level salary (South Carolina cost of living). This will allow me to heavily focus on paying my state loan principle off before accumulating costs of independent needs. Although I am focusing on the latter portion of the situation, I am still open to discussion on the most effective means of paying off my student debt (i.e. taking into account my studies, potential geographic-specific jobs, setting initial employment goals, etc.).

The meat of the matter comes with the need for capitol in order to start of the business of mine. I have a terribly vague idea of what the start-up costs may be, as I have almost entirely given up on the idea due to imminent monetary stress. That's why I'm here now. I want to know if starting a business while having student loans is still a viable option without risking major stake in the future of my business because of initial inability to access capitol. 

I am open to PM about the specific business and attempt to draft a formal start-up budget, however, I would prefer to leave specifics out in the comments should it be at all possible. That being said, the business entails:

Property Acquisition
Initial Landscaping
Legal Protection of Clients
Advertising
Product/Company Partnerships

Again, as a new poster I'm not sure what all to include without a direct prompt. I will attempt to swiftly reply with a thoroughly detailed answer to any and all questions and appreciate any insight on the matter, as I truly see a successful business idea going to waste otherwise.

personalfinance,Large student loan in parent's name,"First off I was lucky enough to have parents that took a bet on my career by taking out a Parent PLUS loan in my mother's name. It is a big stinker of a loan at $64,000 (it was consolidated from several smaller ones around graduation). The interest rate is 4.25% with a monthly minimum of $400. I don't have any problem paying this and have been paying it for the entirety of the loan repayment thus far ~ 9 yrs. 

Due to the nature of the loan, I can't transfer it to myself. This is good because it doesn't show up as a big stinker of debt on credit but is bad because I'm not building credit from paying it. 

Is it worth paying off quicker or should I use the extra money on savings, house fund, retirement?  Does it make sense to get a large loan in my name to pay it off? I know you lose some loan forgiveness options but I don't think the Parent loan qualifies for most of that.

Up front, let me say that we've got a 6+ month emergency fund.  We have been fully funding 2 Roth IRAs and I contribute to my 401k.  We're in pretty good financial shape and have weathered some unexpected disasters (house/car repairs) without dipping into the emergency fund.

We've been in the same home for several years.  We bought shortly after the housing bubble burst, but apparently didn't wait long enough.  We refinanced in 2010 to get a lower interest rate, get rid of PMI and switch into a 15 year loan.  Our current details are:

* Paid: $185,000
* Home value: $130,000-140,000
* Loan amount remaining: $102,000
* Payment (including taxes and all that): $1,300
* Scheduled payoff date: 2025
* Budget for desired house: ~$300,000
* Credit score: 800

We've been never been entirely happy with the house, but it's not terrible.  Stuff breaks and we fix it.  The neighborhood is not terrible, but has issues with trash, domestic disputes, police helicopters overhead, and the occasional robbery.  We would discuss our overall happiness every few months and decide to stay and continue to invest our retirements.  The goal was always to stay and pay off the house.

We recently got a dog, so we've been spending way more time outside which has really brought the issues to the boiling point.  First and foremost is the trash.  If you've ever walked a dog on a sidewalk littered with chicken bones, you'd understand.  So we really want to move.  I admit, it's a very emotional decision.

We've been prepping the house to sell (fixing, painting, emptying it out into a storage unit).  People have brought up the option of renting it out and scraping together money for another mortgage, then using the profits from the rental to make up the down payment shortfall (PMI, etc).

The options as I see it are:

1) Sell now, as quickly as possible.  Hopefully get $30k in profit in my pocket to put a down payment on a $300,000 house.  Not a financially ideal decision, but it gets us into a happier place.

2) Refinance into a 30 year mortgage, which would drop the payments to around $650/month.  Stay some amount of time (up to 12 months) to avoid getting accused of mortgage fraud.  Scrape together whatever money we can to buy the new house, and rent out the current house.  

3) Stay.  Suck it up that the neighborhood is not the worst place in the world to live.  Wait the market out until the house is worth more and/or we owe less.  Sell/Rent and buy a new place when we're in a much better financial spot.

My husband has worked for a long time to fix his credit. He recently checked the score (March, I think) and it was a 740! We were over the moon; talking houses and kids. However, in June a background check revealed a tax lien has been applied to my husband's credit in April. It said it was income tax from 2008, which made no sense because his taxes were filed and paid. He never received a notice that something was owed or incorrect. He tried to investigate, but was sent from office to office to office with no solid results. It should be noted that we live in another state now, so it's difficult to go demand attention.

So, finally, we get an actual bill for the amount we owe! Like, $700. It's not an astronomical amount or anything. We call the number on the bill to get more details and we find out this:

His taxes were indeed properly filed and paid on time that year.

In 2011, 3 years later, the county revisited and altered 2008's taxes. The tax office sent a notice to the address listed on his 2008 taxes with the option to dispute the charger, but he didn't live there anymore. No other attempts were made to contact him. When he didn't dispute the charge, they went forward with charging him and eventually, in April 2014, settled in court that he owed $700 and applied the lien. The guy we talked to said that since they weren't specifically notified of an address change, we can get stuffed and they're not required to put forth an effort to find him, essentially.

Honestly, paying the money isn't an issue. I'm not sure that it's legit to go back and alter taxes 3 years later, but maybe it is! The attempts made to contact him were pitiful. One letter? It's not like we never filed taxes again. Then the lien! That's the problem. He's been working on fixing his credit since he was 19 and realized that his mom had opened credit lines with his info when he was 12. We had plans to buy a house. He's freaking out because he thinks that we'll have to wait 7 years for the lien to fall away. It would be awesome if we could pay the $700 and it would disappear, but that's just not how it works.

So, has anyone else experienced this? Are we screwed? I'm just so pissed off about this mess! It seems like the county in question just has us over a barrel.",finance,1409357376

personalfinance,SO just inherited 200k and is freaking out. What do we do?,"Hello!

So my SO just inherited ~200k from a family member and it's causing her a lot of anxiety. She had planned for about 5k, and well...got a bit more. 

While this is probably a good problem to have, we both grew up relatively poor (I don't think anyone in my family has even heard the words 200k before), so we both don't have much to stand on. Also, I make about 50k in my job, she's somewhere around 35-40k. 

Here's what we briefly talked about with doing with the smaller sum, and I figured we'd stick to that:

We both have some student loan debt with high interest rates (10% for me, 7.8% for her), they're both small at this point (&lt;5000), but we both figure it'll help us in the long run. Paying these off seems the most intelligent and likely outcome. (We both do have more loans outside of that, but we're both up for public service loan forgiveness due to our field)

She bought a new car, as mine is getting beyond old, and we both walked through the process of finding a car that will serve us well for the new 10 years. Paying this off doesn't seem too much of an issue. 

She has a small amount of credit card debt, so that'll probably be the first to go. 

Outside of that, we don't have a house payment (due to our field), and I'm debt free (Once again, outside of student loans). We don't see ourselves buying a house in the next 5 years, although we do see a wedding on the horizon. 

Thoughts? Even if we spent all of this money on our loans/the car, we'd still at least have 50+k left, and that's being incredibly conservative. 

We've talked about stocks, we've talked about savings accounts, we spoke briefly about a financial planner....but we could really use advice.

personalfinance,"I've radically changed my relationship with money, but could use some advice...","Greetings all!

I have been lurking this subreddit for a few months now, and I’ve been really trying to turn my financial life around for the past year or so from brazen disregard and instant-gratification consumerism to a more frugal and long-term plan. I’m going to break down my past and current situations and would appreciate some feedback on my plans for the future.

**My Past**

I spent my 20’s having a lot of fun, at least I can say that. I am a web developer, and was a long-time freelancer, but the type of freelancer whose priority was working as little as possible to cover my expenses and not an hour more. I lived completely hand-to-mouth for almost ten years, which seems insane to me now. My biggest mistake though, during this period, was that I set nothing aside for retirement and built up some debt instead.

**My Present**

I’m now in my early 30’s. I am in ~$23,000 of debt, at an effective interest rate of 3.045% annually. I took a salaried position a few months ago at $85k plus benefits. My monthly take-home is ~$4800, and my base budgeted expenses are currently ~$2200, so I am able to save / pay off debt with the majority of my income, ~$2600 per month. I have no credit card debt, a credit score of 800+, own my car outright (recent year Tacoma in good shape, so no need for another any time soon), and no mortgage (still renting). But my savings is very low (1-month emergency fund currently), and I have zero put away for retirement.

**My Future**

I am on a five-year payment plan to get clear of the money I owe. Part of me really wants to pay that down as quickly as possible just to be done with it (I could feasibly have it paid off before the end of 2015), but another part of me thinks that because the interest rate on it is relatively low I should let it ride for longer while I get other financial priorities in order. I am building my emergency fund which I’m aiming for 3-months of bare minimum expenses. I am also actively working on lowering my expenses.

When I hit the 1-year mark at my current company, I will become eligible for a 3% matching retirement plan, which I fully intend on maxing out. Should I be maxing out an IRA in the mean time?

What do you think about paying off my debt as quickly as possible versus other possibilities, like investing the money or putting it in a retirement fund? I am also interested in buying a home in the next few years, especially since rent is my biggest expense, but building savings for a good down payment would come at the cost of either paying off other debt or making investments.

I have read the FAQ and am actively researching these topics, but I am still struggling some with how to prioritize. Any advice or guidance would be appreciated.",finance,1409415366

personalfinance,Opinion on paying off student debt with CC,"I recently got approved for a $7K limit Discover card with 1% cashback and 15 months no interest.  One of my student loans is currently $1,655.04 with a 6.55% interest rate that I'm paying the minimum of $50 a month.

I've figured I'd be paying $364.40 in interest to my student loan servicer if I continue to pay the minimum over its life.

I have 3 scenarios:
A) Pay it off in full with some of my emergency fund (I have pretty liquid assets elsewhere I can leverage if SHTF and I have great job security)
B) Transfer the balance to my Discover and setup automatic payments to have it paid off before interest kicks in.
C) Accelerate my payments with the loan servicer so I don't have to pay as much in interest.

What are y'all opinions?  Will turning student debt to revolving debt be bad?  I'll still have less than 10% debt/credit ratio.  Will this affect my score at all?

BTW, my loan servicer also has 2 additional loans:
$2084 @ 5.25%
$3211 @ 6.3%

No other debts to my name.

personalfinance,"I think it's about time I started being better with my money, where to start? (UK)","First part is going to be a little back story, maybe a paragraph or two, then onto current situation.

Okay so growing up we never really had that much money, don't get me wrong, my parents gave me a lot which I am very grateful for, but since I've started earning my own money I have been very wasteful with it. I've been able to go out and get what I couldn't have before. But I need to change this habit as it's not realistic.

So my credit rating should be pretty good. I've had numerous phone contracts, subscription services, direct debits, etc that have all been paid no problem. I have had 3 Apple finance loans which were all paid off early, which I was told would not effect me by paying off early. And I have got a credit card which is paid off in full each month. I currently have no outstanding debt, as I did not go to University.

I do however have an order on a car, which is on finance. Will be just under £200 a month for 3 years (do not own after). Other than that my monthly outs are my phone contract, Sky TV, Adobe CC, and BT Sport. I also pay my parents rent for living at home, but it isn't much in comparison to what actual rent would be.

So that is a little back story and current out goings. I would say that I am in a comfortable place by not being in debt or having to worry too much about where I live. But that is not always going to be the case and I need to make a change sooner rather than later.

I have an okay job, it's about £16k a year (that's before tax). I'm 22, I don't have a pension plan in place, I have a savings account but the interest rate on it is pointless. But I just spend my money each month and I'm not saving anything at the moment.

So far this month I have not put anything on the credit card, which I am happy with, so that's a start. But I need to start thinking more about my future. I have little respect for money, I actually hate what it represents. But if you want to live in this world, you need to learn how to use it properly. I don't want to be in debt, I want to be debt free.

From what I've read, federal student loans don't have prepayment penalties (I realize I'll need to read the fine print), so I felt this was a good way of minimizing total interest paid on the loans and still having the additional flexibility of a lower monthly payment in the event I lose my job or have a tough month.",finance,1409441272

This “Appropriations, outlays, and Balances” report included the expense accounts and left over ongoing fund balances that are appropriated to the Senate, the House of Congress, the Library of Congress, the Architect of the Capital, the Botanical Garden, the Capital Police, an on and on…

And, while some of these “appropriations” were funny, some were not.

For instance, let’s look at the Senate…

Did you know that each year the Treasury allots a certain amount of taxpayer money to go to the “Senate Hair Care Revolving Fund”?

Yep… The Federal Government has a fund that was created specifically for the hair care of its Senators! For fiscal year 2010, $33,387 was used to outlay this expense. The word outlay simply means “to spend, an amount expended, paid expenditures”.

There are only 100 Senators – 2 representing each of the 50 states.

This means that on each senator $333.87 in taxpayer money was spent to keep them looking sharp for the cameras, hairpieces and all!

But then, I guess that’s about what you’d expect from a fake Hollywood production like this.

But even more importantly, this “revolving fund” has a balance, which is appropriated solely for this Senatorial hair care. That fund balance, which is invested and gains each year, is $261,117.19. That represents a gain for this fund over fiscal year 2009 of about $36,000.

So we have a quarter of a million dollars designated for Senatorial hair care while many U.S. citizens live in destitute tent cities. It’s kinda funny… and kinda not.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Farther down the list we have the “Senate Restaurant Fund”, listed as a “Public Enterprise Fund”.

The Senators tapped this fund for $72,370.12 for fiscal year 2010. This left a remaining balance in the “Senate Restaurant Fund” of $49,859.53.

That adds up to about $723.70 per Senator.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The taxpayers also paid $123,856.74 towards the “Senate Health And Fitness Facility, Architect Of The Capitol”. This left an account balance of $256,380.37.

So taxpayer funded Senatorial gym memberships apparently cost $1,238.56 for each member of the Senate.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The “Official Mail Costs, Senate” column states that the Federal Government appropriated $300,000 to this cost, adding to the existing balance already appropriated for Senate mailing services of $345,430.58. And after $115,546.71 of this money was actually used for mail, $161,082.59 was “withdrawn or used for other transactions”, the fund balance was left for fiscal year 2010 at $368,801.28 – a gain of a bit more than $22,000.

This represents $2,766.29 per senator for 2010.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

How about the “Senate Gift Shop Revolving Fund, Senate”?

Well, this fund has $2,939,413.53 within it. What this taxpayer money is used for is unclear, but these guys managed to spend $166,673.26 over fiscal year 2010.

This represents $1,666.73 per Senator.

The “Senate Recording Studio Revolving Fund, Senate” spent $22,722.52, leaving a fund balance of $1,945,771.10.

“Salaries And Expenses, Office Of The Legislative Counsel Of The Senate, Senate” - We see that $7,154,000 was appropriated by the Senate itself for the Senator and staff Salaries. Of that amount, $6,394,041.59 was actually paid out (outlay) to the Senators and staff.

That left a balance in this account of $939,136.37.

That represents $63,940.41 per Senator.

“Salaries, Officers And Employees, Senate” -

$168,217,500.00 – Amount appropriated in 2010.

$150,017,546.99 – Amount paid (outlay) to officers and employees in 2010.

$27,053,492.09 – Account balance end of 2010 fiscal year, an increase of about 5.1 million over 2009.

$1740.00 - Average amount paid divided by 100 Senators.

So what does all of this mean?

Well, what is your definition of wasteful spending?

In order for each state to have two representatives, a total for the country of 100 Federal Employees for which we call “Senators”, and with the understanding that this in no way represents all monies spent on the Senate or the money that each state pays separately for each Senator (employees, office leases, supplies, legal council, etc.), the taxpayers paid at least the following for 2010:

$8,162,563.35 per Senator (in blue above)

$815,257,003.33 spent/outlay (in purple above)

Of course, the actual amount appropriated for these things is always much higher than the actual costs by thousands or millions of dollars. Sadly, this is purposeful. And, the account and fund balances that have accumulated over the years from over-appropriation (assigning too much money) to these funds for 2010 stand at at least a total of:

$297,905,741.83 excess account and fund balances (in red above).

All of this (plus much much more that is not listed here) just to have 100 men and women pretend to represent us. Remember, these are the people who don’t even read the bills presented to them by their corporate lobbyists before they sign them!

That treason costs the taxpayers of America over $815 million dollars, and well over $1 billion if all related expenses were taken into account.",finance,1409455326
personalfinance,[CANADA]How to lower federal tax to lowest possible level on ~100k income,"Hello All

I just started my first job this year that isn't fixed hourly with no benefits. I make between $100-120k before tax. I am salaried at 56k, plus 20k hardship, 17k guaranteed OT and a variable amount of OT that usually bumps my biweekly over 4k gross. 

My only fixed expenses are 1.2k/month paid to my company for a house + utilites (wayyy below market price, utilities alone are around 3k/month) and 130/month for a car that my brother uses. We are given vehicles here to use. We are not permitted to contribute to the company pension, only the company puts money in.

I live in the NWT. My wife does not work and I include her on my taxes. She does NOT have a SIN. The feds don't deduct the ~25/day northern allowance from my taxes, so i expect to be refunded that. Is there any way to reduce the taxes, or opt out of CPP/EI?

I was directed here from /r/cars because ever since I was a kid I've wanted a G35 coupe. I know spending 9k on that car from my incoming 17k isn't smart, and I don't plan on doing that. Some background:

My schooling is paid for via FAFSA and Scholarships. My car is paid for. I bought my own car at the age of 16; it's a 2003 Nissan Altima that doesn't really give me any problems. I have no debt, my family does, and I'd love to help them. Of course, I'm only coming along 17k which I've learned isn't as much as I thought at once.

I do plan on investing the vast majority of this money, in a diversifying manner. I'd like to invest in stocks, I'd like to buy and sell on Craigslist, and see what other options are open as well. I'd love to hear your take on this situation, along with the bonus question I initially asked /r/cars... How much money should I have in total, before dropping $10,000 on a G35?

I appreciate if you read this and appreciate it more if you give me some advice. I'd love to know what kinds of steps I can take to ensure I take full advantage of this once-or-never in a lifetime opportunity of getting a bulk of cash all at once. How do I make it grow? How can I diversify my investments?

personalfinance,"To consolidate, or not to consolidate...(x-post r/StudentLoans)","I posted this in r/StudentLoans but thought I'd seek some PF insight as well. 

I have approximately 15 Federal Student loans totaling ~$155,000 at this point. (Undergrad and Grad. I know.)
I want to do PSLF as I am working in the public sector and plan on doing so for a while. Four of the above loans are Stafford, which do not qualify for PSLF. However, they are the least amount and are all under $5000 each.
I am currently in the application process of consolidating as I wanted to include those so they could be forgiven. But now that I'm looking at it, I can probably just pay those ones down eventually as I have IBR on them anyways and once the other loans are paid off/forgiven I can just tackle those down.
The benefit of not consolidating is that if I wind up getting out of the public field and no longer qualify for PSLF, I can tackle the individual loans...
I also have three Perkins loans totaling ~ $2500 which i put in the consolidation application. I haven't been billed for this yet, but I believe its a two year repayment period. Should be getting a bill this month...
Anyways, my question is - should I go ahead with the consolidation or should I just work on paying off the Stafford/Perkins loans and anticipate the rest will be forgiven under PSLF?
I've only been in repayment for a few months, but that's about 4/120 of the payments towards PSLF that would disappear if I consolidate...

I've been reading this sub for awhile now, but finally I decided to post something myself. I live in Sweden but I hope you can help me out with some general advice about managing my finances and paying my mortgage. All prices and values are converted to usd. Also, please excuse my poor english!

So recently, I bought an apartment for about 250k, paid 15% cash and 85% in loan. My interest rate is about 2.4%. Per month, the interest rate plus other apartment bills (heating, electricity, so on) will cost me about 1k. I make about 2800 (after tax). 

I usually don't need more than 800 for food and other costs, so I can put aside about 1k per month. 

My question is, should I pay back each month as much as I can? Some people advice me to save that money and pay more at once (for example, save for one year and then pay back more). 

My plan was to pay back as much as I can and as soon as possible but now I'm having doubts about it.

Also, I still have about 5k in an emergency fund.",finance,1409495321

personalfinance,"Looking into high yield online savings account, anyone have experience with GE or Ally? Or another?","Per someone's suggestion on Reddit, I bought the book (used, of course ;D) ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi to read along with the Dave Ramsey books I love to death. Silly title aside, the book has been great so far! He mentions high yield online saving accounts and gives his own personal favorites, but since the book is from 2009, I'm shopping around. 



I currently have a checking account, a savings account for my emergency fund, and a savings account for my money challenges (for student loans) at my local bank, Rockland Trust. I really like having them all in one bank and one online place, but I've read a lot about these online savings accounts and it seems to be worth doing since my money is just sitting there making like .3% interest (pretty much nothing, I got $0.01 the other day). 



I was thinking of moving my emergency fund to one of these, or starting a new savings all together simply for student loans (while I work on the debt snowball - I have $100k in student loans). 



GE Capital Bank looks like it has the highest interest rate and Ally Bank looks good too. I like the option of depositing checks from my mobile phone into one of these accounts, as I pet sit on the side and I'm usually paid in the form of a check - all the money I get from pet sitting goes to all of my savings accounts. I also looked at Capital One 360 and really liked the option to have subcategories for your money, so that's a plus. None of these seem to have any fees, unless I'm not understanding correctly.



So I would just like to get some opinions from anyone here who may have had experience with any of these accounts. Good, bad, whatever you can tell me would be much appreciated to help me make a decision. If there is anything I should know about these online accounts, like it not really being worth it, that would be great to know too.

personalfinance,"Question about a student loan hack I may have found, looking for someone to poke a hole in it!","I recently graduated with a masters degree in accounting. With that and my undergraduate degree came about $45,000 in student loans, about $25,000 of which are subsidized.

When I was deciding to take out additional loans for grad school, I knew how much I would be earning and I knew I could afford to pay about $1,000 a month towards my student loans so I figured it would take me about 4 years to pay off my loans. What I didn't factor in was COMPOUNDING INTEREST (boo!).

After graduating I sat myself down and decided to learn everything I could about student loans and my personal situation. After running some different calculations in Excel I decided that I would really like to pay off the higher interest rate loans first and then pay the lower interest rate loans. I also decided that I really hated compound interest. 

The conclusion that I came to was that, for me, the ideal option is to enroll in a community college part time. I found the cheapest college that offered online classes and enrolled. I am currently attending Eastern Arizona College and pay $190 for 6 credit hours. This allows me to place my loans in deferment, meaning that I now have no student loan payments and no interest accruing on my subsidized loans for 6 months. 

So I paid $190 in tuition, but I will get to claim the lifetime learning credit on my tax return so that will reduce my net cost to 152. I made sure to enroll in courses that didn't require textbooks, because that could have messed things up for me. I also enrolled in one class I was actually interested in and one very easy class. 

My $25,000 in subsidized student loans will now not be accruing interest for 6 months saving me about $600 in interest and I will be able to strategically pay all $1,000 per month towards my higher interest rate loans. 

**tl;dr** So, net cost of tuition $152 interest charges saved $600 net savings of $448. Any issue here?

**edit** It's not that I didn't understand compound interest or I didn't think it applied to me, I just ballparked badly. Yes, that was dumb of me.  

**edit 2** For me, I really enjoy school, so the time I spend on the classes I really don't consider a sacrifice or a drawback and one of the classes I'm taking is very interesting! 

**Final edit** I honestly didn't think my wording would be so picked apart in /r/personalfinance, I was really just posting this to see if there was something I was missing and maybe to help someone out that was in a similar situation.

I've gotten enough contracts my way that the only way to fulfill my obligations is by quitting my day job and focusing on my work, clients, and exposure. The work isn't much different than a DJ and my primary income is cash.

The whole art, sales, and finding contracts part I am pretty decent with. However I have never been the best with finances. I am stable on my feet now with enough money to pay my bills through the year and live comfortably. I've formed an LLC, made a small business bank account with my credit union, and deposited the majority of the money from my business over this summer.

Being a cash business I've kept a spreadsheet documentation of the dates of shows I did, venues and promoters who have paid. I've also made sure to keep track of any miles I drove for work, also any business type dinners, and business equipment expenditures. I want to keep on top of everything the best I can and maximize my ability to write-off stuff for taxes.

I've never filed quarterly taxes and I am getting ready to for the first time in my life. I've got a good track of my gross income from my VJ work. I know the best thing for me now would probably to find a good accountant and a tax professional to work with. I've been learning GNUcash to keep better track of my finances.

I am local to Virginia. I know I will need to pay both federal and state income tax, federal self employment tax. Will have to pay to keep my LLC renewed yearly. Also local business license.

I know the best thing for me to do will be to hire an accountant and a tax professional.
