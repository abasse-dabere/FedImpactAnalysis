personalfinance,Any reason not to put all my investment in a 3X leveraged (bull) S&amp;P 500 ETF?,"This question in the title is being posed from a general standpoint--I think it is meaningful to discuss regardless of my situation...

However, it might be helpful to have some background on my specific situation... 

* I'm a 3rd year law student, with employment lined up after graduation.
* After sizing up my reasonable liquidity needs over the next 13 months, I have about $10K laying around.
* I have about $150K in debt with a maximum interest rate under 7%.

Contentions:

1) Given that I don't ""need"" the money--i.e. my retirement plans are not dependent on it--I should simply be seeking the maximum average annual return possible--without regard for volatility.

2) Assuming (1) is true, there is no better  investment vehicle that would not require either ""a magical knack,"" ""inside information,"" or an enormous dedication of time and energy.

3) Now or upon graduation it would be rational to make only minimum payments on my student loans--and instead invest as much as possible in this vehicle. Or is there some good reason to pay down/prefer a non-leveraged ETF?",finance,1409530354

personalfinance,How can I get started in foreign microfinancing for development?,"This is only tangentially a personal finance question, but hopefully someone can help me (or point me to who will know).

I've been considering trying to help do some microfinance-type loans to people I know in the Dominican Republic (I live in the US). Essentially I'd like to provide capital (in the 5-10k range probably) to start small businesses. I would most likely help mentor them in entrepreneurship and have a somewhat active role in advising the businesses. I would prefer to treat these as real businesses and not charities (something like a social enterprise) so I would want to earn a real rate of return on the invested capital (10%+ to account for the risk).

[**Edit**: clarification - I already know qualified borrowers, and there are a number of ideas for what businesses they could start with the capital. The main issue as I outline below is how to legally structure the situation and deal with tax issues]

My questions are mostly:

* How can I structure the loans/ownership so the situation is legal and I can pay appropriate taxes on the returns? I'm care less about having any legal recourse to deal with defaults (I realize that I'm taking on substantial risk).
* If I wanted to maintain an ownership stake in the enterprises they started, would I want to form a US incorporation (I live in WA state)? Would I want to try to incorporate in the DR (however that would work) and be an owner of a foreign business? How would I report profits on my taxes?
* Could I simply make a personal loan and have a contract stipulate either a fixed interest rate, or a portion of the income from their operations? If this would work I would think I can just report any income as additional personal income.

I could try to find a lawyer to deal with this, but I worry that at the level of investments I'm looking at, the cost of that would easily ruin any returns. My personal preference would lean towards incorporating it as a separate enterprise so I could keep the returns in the corporation and reinvest them.

personalfinance,$20K in Vanguard index funds VS ETFs (...and a few questions about taxes),"Hi all! Thanks to some of the kind people and their advice on this subreddit, I've been gaining a far better understanding of my personal finances than before. As such, I had another set of questions I was hoping you great folks could answer.

Some quick background:

* 26 years old
* 90K salary 
* 52K in savings, 3K in checking
* Maxed out Roth IRA and on track to max out TSP/401K for this year
* Long term partner is finishing fellowship and will be a practicing surgeon in less than a year. The stats provided above are my finances only, as my partner and I are not planning on joint accounts until we buy a home together. As such, I'd like to plan as if I'm going into everything alone for now.

As a whole, I know how to budget my money, and I've got more than enough as an emergency fund, regardless of whether or not my partner's income/savings is taken into account. So basically, of the $52K in my savings account, I've set aside approximately $32K as my future down-payment/emergency funds. With the 20K leftover, I've decided to open a taxable account because (1) my savings account interest rate isn't doing anything for me, and (2) I'd like to get some practice investing in different index funds/ETFs and rebalancing (eventually).  I'll probably do a 30/70 split between stocks/bonds (it's more conservative just in case I really feel the need for a bigger down payment on a house or something). But before I move forward, I've got a few questions:

1) I'd like to start a simple 3-fund portfolio in either Vanguard's index funds or Vanguard's ETFs. Reading through the various blogs/posts/info, there doesn't seem to be a huge difference between the two specific to Vanguard, because Vanguard doesn't charge commission/trade fees on their ETFs as long as you stay within the Vanguard family (I'm pretty sure I've read all this correctly, so feel free to correct me if so). So, could someone provide any advice on what might be the better option between the index funds and ETFs? A few more caveats:

* I don't plan on doing crazy amounts of active trading or anything like that; I don't want to try and time the market. The only time when I'm looking to buy/sell if when I need to re-balance my portfolio. So, I don't really see the advantage of being able to sell ETFs at any time during the day.
* One primary benefit of ETFs is that they tend to have lower expense ratios than Vanguard's index funds. Since I'm only starting out with $20K split between 3 funds, I'd probably only be able to qualify for Admiral Shares (and thus, lower expense ratios) on the bond index fund I choose; everything else would be normal investor class.
* Apparently, ETFs are also even more tax efficient than index funds. I'm not really sure how this actually plays out, but I'm not really quite sure I understand where this occurs (I've read a lot about this, but since I've had no prior experience with a taxable account, some of it goes over my head). Is there any difference in how capital gains are taxed between index funds and ETFs at the year's end? And, can anyone provide so layman's explanation of when these tax efficiencies are important for a passive investor?
* I do plan on adding probably about $500-700 a month to my portfolio. Figured it's better than growing my savings accounts too large. Will this make a difference, especially if Vanguard doesn't charge the whole brevy of typical ETF fees?
* What's the difference in reinvesting dividends between normal index funds and ETFs? I've read that index fund dividends reinvest automatically, while ETFs may not (so...you manually allocate them later on? If so, how does this process work? The dividends are sent to you in a check and you just reinvest them?). Sorry if this (or any other question) is kind of moronic; I'm really just trying to get a better grasp on this stuff.

2) And the second question is just a general question about the tax process and index funds/ETFs. Basically, I know about the capital gains tax for both the short term (typically ordinary tax rate) and long term (typically a lower tax rate). As I understand it, you incur the capital gains tax regardless of whether the dividends were reinvested (the fund manager just reinvested it automatically) or you sold a share for a gain. Is that correct?  For example: I invested $100 in a share of an index fund. The share price goes up to $110 after more than a year. When tax time comes, the same capital gains tax rate is applied to the $10 gain, regardless of whether it was automatically reinvested into the index fund or if I just took the $10 in a check.

3) Tax-loss harvesting. I've read a bunch of general posts about it (thanks bogleheads site!), but I still would like a bit more of a layman's explanation. Basically, as I understand it, if the value of one fund's shares drop, I can use that to offset the gains from another fund during tax season. And, if the loss is greater than the gain, I can use that loss the reduce my taxable income. Is that correct? Also, can tax-loss harvesting only be used if the shares are sold? Like, when tax time comes, let's say one fund increases by $5 and the other fund increases by $10. If I don't actually sell the funds, I can't actually claim a $5 loss (?).

Also, if there any other general tax tips/info you can share regarding index funds/ETFs, please feel free to share. I've never had to do anything in regards to taxes and a taxable investment/brokerage account before. It's pretty scary because taxes have always been a quick and easy 10-minute process for me.

personalfinance,Help with student loans,"Ok, here's the deal: before I met my wife she took out several thousands in student loans, switched schools after first year (program didn't suit her. It happens... ) Then had to take out new student loans for new school. Health problems cropped up, along with money problems (prevented her from getting part time work to support herself). We were LDR at the time (myself in Canada her in the US) when she made the decision to drop out due to health. We decided to get married during her ""sabbatical"" then she moved to Canada to be with me so I could take care of her. Her intent was always to go back when her health improved. She had been up here a year, when out of the blue, her school shuts down. Now there's no other options for schooling she has no degree to show for it and we owe approximately 120k in student loans. Now, her parents - who still reside in the US and aren't doing well, financially speaking - co-signed the loans. There still making house payments on a $100k+ mortgage, but that's another story. 

  Now where we stand is, we're currently dealing with $1200 a month in student loan payments (not smart - not a good situation, I know, and I knew going into the marriage but I love her I wasn't going to let money stop us from being together) which is more than $1300 CDN with currency conversion variously the loan companies are bank of ND, Sallie Mae, Discover and Wells Fargo (also federal loans - I'm Canadian so I don't know how it works down there) now I have no problem making payments. It's money owed it has to be paid. I'm not looking for any way to cheat the system or to get out of paying, but not knowing anything about this sort of stuff (no post-secondary education for me) I was hoping there was a way to get payments reduced. Even halving that amount would allow us to survive, because as it is, to afford to make these payments we've been staying with my parents here in Canada who have generously let us stay rent-free (though I help out where I can). Rent where we live is pretty bad and I've been trying to find extra work, cutting expenses but that only goes so far. We've already been staying here for 2 years and we need to be on our own as a married couple. I do also intend to go on to get some fancy education (business administration, maybe) but having to make these loan payments plus having something to live on right now is impossible and currently it'll take a decade or more to pay these down. 

  Again, I have no problem with the idea of paying what is owed, and we both know mistakes were made taking out such huge loans, but right now we just wanted to know if there's any way to at least reduce payments for now. Btw, her deferrment was used up during her earlier ""sabbatical"". 

  Anyway, thanks for any help you can offer /r/personalfinance. Even if it's just to call us idiots.  :)

personalfinance,"Which is smarter: Selling current stock portfolio to pay down student loans, or juggle both for future returns on stocks?","I'm just getting into all this ""responsible"" personal finance realm, and am at a crossroads that I'm looking for input on. 

Short version: I have about $10K in student loans (~4.25% averaged across the three loans) and about $6K in a single company for stocks (BBY- ESPP). I'm trying to decide whether to dump all my stocks come peak in Nov-ish to pay off my student loans, or just ride them both out and keep the stocks for future stuffs. 

I pay about $140/mo in student loans currently, which is about all I can afford. My Fidelity account (still a noob at analyzing all this) indicates that my stocks have increase ~53% since 2010. Which would be roughly 13% a year return (am I doing that right?). 

I know, now, that having all stocks in one company is a poor plan. I started the ESPP as a part timer years back with the intent of dumping all of it to pay off my student loans. Now, being a bit older and not too much wiser, I'm not sure if that's a good idea in a long run.

I also recently got a $3k personal line of credit from my bank at 11% interest that I haven't touched yet. The intent for that was for emergency stuff, but thought about using it to consolidate my credit cards (only about $1200). Being higher interest rate than the student loans, that doesn't help me much, just thought I'd mention it. 

Just looking for some thoughts/input. I have started trying to educate myself on other stocks and what to invest in. I purchased Tesla stock recently as a learning experience (and I just wanted to own some), and it was an eye opener. I'd love to look into bonds and options, but that's a different discussion. 

Any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: Just wanted to clarify the only reason I have the stocks in one company is cause it was an easy hands free way to put money away through the employee stock purchase program and payroll deduction, plus the discount and instant return.

Is it possible to figure out how much will I owe the IRS in taxes this 2014?

My understanding is this example. You work in a specific tax bracket. If all you owe is 100 dollars in taxes from your job but you happen to give the gov't more money such as 300 at the end of the year. You get a Tax refund of 200 because 100 was all that was owe to the IRS from you that year.

If this example is determined to be true. I wanted to know how much I will owe the IRS at the end of year. 

I ask of this because I changed my w-4 to have x amount of money withdrawn from my paycheck to go to my federal taxes. Hoping that I earn a bigger tax refund next year.

 I do understand I could just use that extra money to pay off debts, expenses, etc. and get a tax refund as close to 0 dollars. I know that by doing that my money being held by the gov't is not getting any interest but I, like many others enjoy having a good amount of change back for our reasons. However, I use my tax refunds to either save or pay off debts more effectively.

personalfinance,"Pay to fix the ""beater"" or upgrade to a newer car?","I have owned older cars (15+ years or older) all my life and have had no problem making the minor $200 or $500 repair here and there. Finally, it has happened where my 1998 civic needs repairs totaling more than than it's worth (clutch, engine mounts, a few leaks, new  axles, etc). The engine runs very smooth with 250,000 miles on it (the thing doesn't even burn oil between changes) and the body/interior is in very good condition.

So, yeah, the ultimate question. Spend $2000 to fix up my $1,500 car or upgrade to something new? I've been looking at 2010-ish cars in the $15k-$20k range. The thought of spending more than my repairs on a down payment plus having a $300/mo loan doesn't sit well with me at all. But throwing good money at an old car also seems like a bad idea.

I have a take-home income of $3,400/mo so a payment won't break me financially, I'm just terrified of going into debt for a depreciating asset. I'd rather throw that payment at my savings/IRA/mortgage than a car.

Spend more than my car is worth to fix her up and be on my way? Throw her to the curb and get a 2010-ish newer car with 200k less miles and enjoy 4 years of monthly car payments?

personalfinance,Pay back student loan or use it so start a business?,"Hello everyone,

after I have finished school, I worked for about two years now. I am planning to start my own business and don't know yet what to do with my outstanding loan-repayments.

As I didn't do any repayments on my student loans yet and considering the low interest rates, my plan is to keep the debt as high as possible to use the money I saved during the time as an employee as kind of a leverage for my new business. However, I don't want to particularly invest the money I saved, I'd rather use it a as a 'safety cushion'  in case I need it.

During my studies I received a loan in form of a monthly payment from a government bank (in Germany). In addition, I received 'one time'-payments from another loan to finance grad school.

So, in total I have two loans from one bank:

* Student loan 1 - $ 25 K - interest rate of currently 3.01 % / yr
* Student loan 2 - $ 10 K - interest rate of currently 1.45 % / yr
 
Until now, I just pay the monthly interest payments of about $ 60. For loan 1, I was offered to a fixed interest rate for ten years, for about 4.54 %, by paying back an annuity of $ 150 a month. I can also pay more or less a month, I just have to pay back the loan in 25 years. Instead of the fixed interest plan, I am able to stick to the flexible rate (currently 3.01 %), which might change / is linked to the EURIBOR-6 months interest rate (comparable to the Feds funds rate). 

Student loan 2, I am able to repay from September 2015 on with a rate of about $ 160 per month or alternatively, I can by it off all at once, anytime. 

As I have worked for almost two years now, I was able to save a little over $ 10 K, for which I'll get interest of about 1.3 %. So, I would only use these savings as kind of a 'safety cushion' as I plan to use my monthly income to pay my bills. For my business, I am planning to raise external money from investors or finance it through ""bootstrapping"".

So, would it be a good decision to keep the repayment for the student loans as low as possible, using my money rather as a ""cushion"", or to rather pay back most of my debt as soon as possible, due to higher interest I pay, than I get? 
In case I was to pay pack the ""low"" annuity of about $ 150 a month, would it be good, to stick to the fixed interest rate plan or should I hope the flexible rate (currently 3.01 %) will remain low in the near future. (My plan is to, once I have all the money, pay back all the debt at once.. so this might hopefully be in 2-3 years, depending on how well I perform with my business :-).

**My overall goal here is to up the rating to lower the interest rate on the mortgage that I will be getting soon.**

After going through the first of 3 reports, I have a couple questions:

* 1) I see for one of my credit cards, high balance every month. I do max this thing out every single month (but pay it all off every month too). The high balance it says is the same for like 7 months in a row. That sounds likely to be an error to me. 

* 2) It says my score is 737 but gives me a 'C'--I thought 737 was a good score? 

* 3) I am considering upping the credit limit for the card I was referring to in bullet point 1. However, I just did that for a different credit card. I currently have 3 official checks on my credit score, and will be having a 4th soon when I start a mortgage. (My overall goal here is to up the rating to lower the interest rate on the mortgage).   So which would be more beneficial for the credit score? Having a higher credit card interest rate or *not* having the extra credit check?

* 4) How high should I ask for the new credit limit to be? When I did my other card the other day, I asked for $5000 (it was a $900 limit) and was approved. I probably could have asked for more, yeah?

* 5) The annualcreditreport.com website logged me out before I could finish reviewing. I cannot see any way to log back in. If I fill out the form again to re-request my reports/scores...will that hurt my credit? I see no support number on their website. The contact form does not even have a place for my email/phone for them to call me back....

personalfinance,Need some advice on where to put my money,"So here is my situation. I am 27 years old. I recently got a decently paid consultant job (making $60K a year).. but with no 401K at all (I hope to have one soon, we have yearly negotiations) So what I did late last year was threw $500 into a ROTH IRA and put it into a mutual fund. I also give it $50 a month.

Here is my situation. I have paid off all of my college debts. The only major loan I still have is my car loan (around $15K left, I bought it last year).. I get a decent interest rate on it (.284). My other expenses are relatively cheap ($500 a month in a shared apartment, other random expenses (internet, cell phone, etc etc). 

My question is, what would be your recommendation? Should I start throwing money into a savings account? Should I keep adding to the Roth IRA? Should I completely pay off the auto loan?

personalfinance,To loan or not to loan? Education reimbursement in conjunction with an unsubsidized Stafford Loan situation.,"Hi PF. I had a question about whether I should take a loan or not. Below are some details about my life/income/cost to help the discussion get started!

A little bit about me:

- Currently working full-time
 - $3k month income after taxes, insurance, retirement contribution
 - $750 disposable income out of the $3k (the rest used in rent, short term savings, etc.)
- Currently pretty stable financially
 - Own a home that's being rented out for mortgage for the next two years
 - No outstanding loans (other than mortgage)
 - Currently have around $4k in savings account, $8k in relatively liquid brokerage account


A little bit about my situation:

- Taking night classes toward a master's degree
 - Costs roughly $6k / semester
 - Will definitely take $6k worth of classes for Fall and Spring semester
 - May be taking $6k worth of classes during summer semester (making total per year roughly $18k)
- Firm is willing to pay for education
 - Up to $15k / year, but paid out after I successfully pass the classes (meaning, I have to pay upfront, and then wait until the end of the semester to receive the check from my firm and then refill my bank account)
 - Only after 6 months of being employed (which means, the first semester I'm paying out of pocket)
 - Since I will receive more than $5.2k in education reimbursement, it will be considered taxable income.
- Got approved for student loan
 - Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
 - up to $20k per year (more than enough)
 - annual interest rate of %6.21 that start accruing as soon as I take out the loan (since it is unsubsidized)

Questions:

- Should I take the loan?
- What are the tax implications if I take out a loan and pay it back?
 - I know the interest on student loans are tax deductible
 - 6% seems very steep
- Anything I'm missing?

I’m hoping to find some advice in this sub to a question for which I have received several various answers.

A few years ago, my grandmother gifted to me a mutual fund that she initially invested about $12,500 into. I kept it for about a year and it increased to $13,600. Earlier this year, I sold the mutual fund and deposited it into my bank account at one time. My  grandmother is alive, so I don’t think this would be classified as an “inheritance,” but rather a “gift.” What do you think? My concern is that on this upcoming tax year I’m going to owe thousands of dollars on this money. It is my understand that I would only have to pay on the gains (on the $1100 that it increased). Do I not have to pay taxes on the original amount of $12,500?

I live in Virginia, make about $27,000 a year, and only take one federal deduction. I’m anxious about whether or not a large chunk of this gift will be taken by the government.

Context

I worked on cruise ships for several years, until finally I got fed up with it and quit.  I landed in January 2013 with about $8k in savings, an undergraduate degree, and no debt.

I've been freelancing since then, but financially it's been “death by a thousand cuts.”  I've learned the hard way that freelancing in a field that you really don't like is probably not the best of ideas . . . but that's a story for another time.  My living expenses usually run ~$1,500/month, while my income is ~ $1,300/month (it always looks like it's going to be more, and then clients don't pay, checks bounce, projects get delayed with endless rounds of revisions . . . I always think I'm going to come out ahead when I'm actually behind).

I have no intention of buying a house or starting a family in the next 5 years.  I don't own a car and have no intention of buying one (carbon footprint and all that).  I live in a fairly expensive mid-size city, near my girlfriend and family.  My expenses are usually:

$655 Rent

$100 Phone

$80 Internet

$30 Electricity

$175 Groceries

$250 Entertainment/Eating Out/Caffeine

~$150 Other miscellaneous stuff

I have ~$1k in credit card debt, ~$75 in checking and $5.01 in savings . . . which is pretty embarrassing.   My moving expenses are covered, luckily.


The New Job

A few weeks ago, I landed a job in Austin, TX.  It's in a new field for me and I'm very excited about it.  I'm moving across the country in two weeks and I start on the 29th.  The job pays $40k/year, or $3,333/month (which is ~$2,800/month after taxes I think?  Please correct me if I'm wrong, I've never calculated that before).  I'll also have health benefits, which is a first for me.

I'm excited about the new job . . . but I'm also nervous.  I haven't been particularly successful at managing my money over the past 18 months and I don't want that cycle to continue.  I want to travel abroad, and I want to start investing, but right now I'm not even keeping my head above water.

The Question

There's story after story out there about people who have money problems, find higher-paying jobs to solve them . . . and then find out that they're no better off than they were before.  This is exactly what I want to avoid!

But considering the past 18 months, I'm not very confident in my ability to manage my money.

This is a great opportunity . . . how do I keep from mucking it up?

investing,Darden Restaurants Analysis,"Note: This analysis is by no means exhaustive, but rather an introductory view and valuation to provide a quick overview of some different methods and psychological approaches an investor may take. 

Overview

In 1934, Benjamin Graham coined a now common saying among value investors, most notably Warren Buffett, who states it thus, “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor economics, it is usually the reputation of the business that stays intact.” Darden competes in a very difficult environment, but it is managed by some of the best restaurant operators in the industry. While the economics of the business are not necessarily poor, Darden would likely struggle to post acceptable returns on capital without the aid of such an adept management team. As it stands, the company has managed to return an average 22.9% on equity over the last ten years with a standard deviation of only 3%, an outstanding showing for a business model that includes owning and operating all but 5 of its 2,138 restaurants rather than a model based on the much less capital-intensive franchising approach. Sadly, their skills in capital allocation do not match their operating prowess. 

The company sports industry leading annual unit sales of almost $4 million among its 2,132 units, for total sales of $8.55 billion. Darden’s two biggest brands, Olive Garden and Red Lobster ranked 2nd and 4th in average unit sales among casual dining restaurants, respectively, as well as 3rd and 4th in total sales. Longhorn represents the third of Darden’s four wheels, with total sales of $1.2 billion and average unit sales of $3 million. Olive Garden and Red Lobster are the most mature of Darden’s brands, with established brands and unit counts. This allows the two to produce large quantities of free cash flow after investing for growth, providing the holding company with $650 million in excess cash. Longhorn will soon catch up with its older brothers, and currently earns enough to finance its own substantial growth, as well as the increased marketing investment needed to support its almost 40 annual net new store openings. 

To supplement its more mature restaurant brands, Darden has used their excess cash production in recent years to build a substantial collection of growth-oriented brands, collectively called the Specialty Restaurant Group. This segment contains five brands with aggregate revenues that should surpass the $1 billion milestone in fiscal 2014: Yard House, The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, and Eddie V’s. Total revenue for the group increased 58% in fiscal 2013 as a result of strong growth in the existing brands, as well as the acquisition of Yard House. 

Darden’s primary issue coming out of the Great Recession is the divergence of its customer base to the extremes of the restaurant spectrum. Rising asset prices have pushed affluent customers into the arms of more elite restaurants, and high unemployment dragged its middle class customers to the more value-oriented fast food chains. This has essentially created a vacuum in the middle for the casual dining industry, resulting in significant pressure on same store sales. As a result, revenue growth has had to come from increasing store counts, requiring relatively larger capital expenditures and hampering margins. 

Red Lobster Sale

On May 16, 2014 Darden announced the sale of Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital for $2.1 billion. At the time, we felt that the transaction significantly undervalued either the Red Lobster 705 restaurant real estate portfolio or the operating restaurant itself, the combined value of which we estimated to be $2.6 billion at a minimum. Indeed, our fears were confirmed when Golden Gate Capital then turned over 500 properties to American Capital Realty for $1.5 billion in a triple-net sale leaseback transaction, implying a $2.1 billion valuation for the full 705 restaurants. This means that Golden Gate essentially got the brand name and restaurant operation cash flow for free.

As excellent restaurant operators, Darden could have negotiated a similar transaction with American Capital Realty while retaining the operating rights, or alternatively, retained the real estate while selling the restaurant operations to Golden Gate. Either of these would have provided greater value for Darden shareholders in the absence of a sale price north of $2.5 billion for the entire business. Instead, Golden Gate ended up with 205 Red Lobster restaurants and the rights to operate the full 705 locations for a net price of $600 million, and ACRP is receiving an 8% cash cap rate on $1.5 billion of property with an initial lease term of 24.5 years and 2% annual rent increases. 

Darden’s allocation of the $1.6 billion in after-tax proceeds is also lackluster. Of the total, $1 billion is being used to retire a portion of the total $2.5 billion in long-term debt. This is an entirely inefficient use of cash now that we can reasonably estimate the value of Darden’s remaining real estate portfolio at $4 billion+, implying a very reasonable loan to value ratio of about 60%. Additionally, there is already room for Darden to decrease interest expense by instead refinancing the $100 million of 7.125% debentures due in February 2016 at the prevailing market rate of 1.6% and the $500 million of 6.2% senior notes due October 2017 at 1.8%. The full $1.6 billion could then be used to continue the growth of the Specialty Restaurant Group either organically or through further acquisitions, with the excess being distributed directly to shareholders via additional dividends or share buybacks. All of the above points to Darden’s need for stronger financial skill on the Board of Directors to supplement their skills in restaurant operations. 

Balance Sheet

The Darden Balance Sheet is of a very high quality. Its investment grade debt is primarily fixed rate, laddered well in stages with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2037, and structured with a long weighted average duration. The fixed rate for extended duration is a key feature given the generationally low interest rate environment. The $2.5 billion in long-term debt is quite reasonable against the backdrop of Darden’s extensive, high quality real estate portfolio, discussed in detail during the Red Lobster sale commentary. 

Assuming Darden’s stated post-sale capital allocation, the company will carry $233.6 million in cash and receivables, along with an estimated $248 million in inventory. The remaining current assets will be comprised of $163 million in prepaid or deferred expenses and taxes, for a total of $644.6 million. The long-term assets will require adjustments to reflect the estimated value above carrying value. The carrying value for the real estate will approximate $2.943 billion after adjusting for the absence of Red Lobster properties, but given the prevailing private market value implied by the American Capital Realty transaction, we can apply a $4.3 billion market value to the 1433 remaining restaurants owned by Darden. Intangible and other assets will total $1.238 billion, bringing total adjusted assets to $6.183 billion.

On the liabilities side, $235 million of the sale proceeds will likely be used to payoff short-term liabilities relating to Red Lobster, with a further $177 million being transferred to Golden Gate. This leaves $1.004 billion in short-term liabilities. Long-term debt is carried at cost, but the remaining $765 million that Darden plans to use retiring debt will have to be deployed at prevailing market prices. Assuming Darden targets its debt with the highest coupon rates, it will require $109 million to retire the 2016 debentures carried at $100 million and $570 million to retire the 2017 senior notes carried at $500 million. This leaves the final carrying value for long-term debt at $1.896 billion. Adjusted deferred taxes and rent will total $478.2 million, capital leases $52.5 million, and $325.4 million other liabilities. Summing the adjusted liabilities side, we arrive at a total of $3.756 billion. 

Subtracting total adjusted liabilities from adjusted assets, the resulting figure is $2.427 billion. Assuming Darden completes its newly planned $700 million share repurchase resulting from the Red Lobster sale, the company would manage to buy 14 million shares at the daily average 2014 price per share of $49.96, bringing total shares down to 117.6 million. Dividing this into our adjusted book value of $2.427 billion, we arrive at a final per share net asset value of $20.63. 

Income Statement

The income statement adjustments are a bit more straightforward. Red Lobster accounted for about 30.5% of both sales and profits, so we can just back it out of the revenue and certain expense accounts. We will first analyze the income statement assuming a no-growth scenario. First, last year’s revenue of $8.552 billion minus the contribution from Red Lobster is $5.952 billion. The 10 year average for Cost of Goods Sold as a percentage of revenue is 77.3% with minimal deviation, while the 5 year average is 77.22%. Averaging these figures together and applying it to our revenue estimate, we arrive at total COGS of $4.599 billion, producing a net gross profit of $1.353 billion. Using the same method to estimate SG&amp;A and Depreciation expenses projects $570 million and $275 million, respectively. The new figure for net interest expense of $89 million results from our balance sheet adjustments and the projected debt retirement resulting from the Red Lobster Sale. Taken together, the resulting pre-tax income estimate is $422 million. Applying a tax rate of 26.3% based on historical figures reduces this $422 million to a final net income figure of $311 million. 

To convert this earnings estimate into a valuation, we need first to apply a required rate of return. The historical on the S&amp;P 500 including dividends is approximately 9.5%, so it seems reasonable to consider this the opportunity cost at which to discount future cash flows. $311 million divided by this 9.5% discount rate produces a total value of  $3.274 billion. Dividing this by the diluted share count of 117.6 million calculated in the balance sheet section gives us estimated average EPS for continuing operations of $27.84. Note that this exceeds the previously estimated post-sale Net Asset Value of $20.63, reflecting Darden’s competitive advantage in restaurant operations. There is a problem however, the current market price for Darden stock is $49.72, far above either of our value figures. Using our trusty discounted cash flows formula, we find that the market price implies perpetual growth of 4.2%. From 1790 to 2013, real GDP growth in the United States was 3.74% annualized. In our view, it would be very difficult (read, mathematically impossible) for Darden to grow earnings faster than the U.S. economy forever. This is particularly problematic given Darden’s performance over the past decade. Even against the backdrop of fairly consistent revenue growth, earnings have had trouble producing an equivalent performance, with a tendency to fluctuate around an average in a linear, rather than exponential, fashion. The combination of this inconsistency and the mathematically unrealistic growth expectations implied by the market price lead us to doubt the wisdom of a long-term investment in Darden at such prices. Note that the Red Lobster sale, including Darden’s added allocation to share repurchases, reduced per share earnings from $3.13 to a projected $2.64. If future growth is not changed a result, that transaction is a 15.6% destruction of shareholder value. In order to justify the sale, Darden’s growth will have to increase by at least 1% annually from what it would have been prior to the sale, and this is in addition to the 4.2% already required to justify the current market price.",finance,1409689295
personalfinance,credit cards finally paid off - do I tackle the autoloan next or save the cash?,"So within this past month I will have paid off my only 2 credit cards.  At one point the total between both in the last 18 months was up to ~$10k.  After this month, they will be zero balanced.  

While paying these off over the last several months I had also set up an automatic savings account with CapitolOne360 - designed to put $700 into savings each month.  This was after I read an article that outlined the 50-30-20 method of money management, I determined that I should have been saving ~700 each month and wasn't doing so.  

My remaining debts are Car and School.  
- 13k owed on my car, loan through my Credit Union with 2.4% APR
- 18.5k owed to Sallie Mae with a 6.5% interest rate
Respectively I am paying $255 and $275 each month towards the two.  

The debate I am having with myself is: do I use the money that is now freed up from the credit cards and put it towards either (or both) of these debts?  OR do I work on building up my savings account?  Which is more important\beneficial in the long run?  A larger savings account would make me feel a little safer and more secure but I feel like the logical thing would be to chip away at those debts but it would be years before they are paid off and I'm nervous to put my savings account on hold until then..

personalfinance,How do I even begin to get my shit together?,"Hi there.

I've been in a bad spot for years. I have some issues with depression, and I've let a lot of things go longer than I should have. I've lost track of debts, etc. I kind of hit a wall the other day - I may need to replace my car (I'll have an insurance payout), and if I do, my credit is so bad that I'm not sure I can even get the shadiest of auto financing. I know I can't turn my credit around quickly enough to address this issue, but it's kind of the last straw for me. I've had to have friends co-sign on apartment leases and so on for too long. 

I need to get to a point where I am not a complete mess. I don't have the kind of income where I can do much to help myself, but there must be some step I can take in the right direction, right?

Also, I am aware that I have been incredibly financially irresponsible. I was only making about 14-15k a year and barely scraping by for so long that ignoring bills I couldn't do anything about became my M.O. I want to change.


Basically, where I'm at now is:

Credit score is around 470, last I checked.
$2000/month income before taxes, which they haven't been taking out because I'm an independent contractor.

$550 month/rent

$100/month car ins

$100/month health ins

Around $50 in utilities.

The debt:

~$30k in fed loans (for which I have a forbearance, and can probably continue to get a forbearance so long as my income is this low)

$3k + interest private loan which I am fairly certain I have defaulted on? 

~$2500 credit card debt that I simply stopped paying at some point. My loans just never came one semester, and I put it on a card. Is there some way to work out a payment plan with collectors? Is there a way to do it without having to speak with them? The last time I tried to speak to one directly they outright lied to me and then yelled at me. As someone with anxiety, I try to avoid confrontations like this.

I have another ~$300 balance on a credit card designed specifically for people with bad credit - I pay a little over minimum on that one regularly.",finance,1409692214
personalfinance,Paying off student loans while still in school.,"I am in my final year of getting my BA and have had to take out loans through FAFSA. Some loans have higher interest rates (6.8%) and have not gotten up too far as of yet (about $800). I do also plan on going to graduate school once I graduate May 2015.

PS I will also have to take loans out to go to graduate school. And I do currently have a budget, I currently live on about $1,100/month (rent, car payment, utilities, etc.) so I could swing maybe $100 or so per month if I pinch my pennies.",finance,1409695170

personalfinance,"29 y/o M, graduating college in June 2015. Some personal finance questions and help would be appreciated","So I graduate in June with a degree in Environmental Sciences (job placement is relatively high), and I will have around 30k-35k in student loans to pay back. All Federal Loans, none are through private lenders.

Im single, and no kids. But, my credit is tanked from two bad credit cards (5,000 limit and 3,500 limit) when I was 18/19 years old. My current score is 623, and has recently gone down from 635 due to some activity on my credit report.

I got a Best Buy Card back in April to buy myself a TV and playstation at 0% interest. ($1,000 Limit) - Current balance is about $800.

Since then I have gotten an Amazon Visa Card ($500 limit), and an L.L. Bean Visa ($500 limit).

I used the Amazon card a decent amount (~$400)  in late July and throughout August for school supplies and books, but paid the entire balance before the due date in late August.
I just bought another txt-book for school for $100 with the amazon card, but I can pay that right off tomorrow.

I have not touched the L.L Bean card other than activating it since I got it a couple months ago.

So, here is my question(s): How can I safely, and effectively, increase my credit score? I have a friend who works for a Ford dealership (I want to buy my first car when I graduate, of course once I get a job) and he told me they approve for no co-signers at credit scores around 680, but he assured me I should be okay even though my credit score is much lower than that. I DONT want to get ""reamed"" on interest rates, so what can I do between now and then to try and brighten up my credit score and recent credit history? A co-signer is not an option for me, so I really need to do what I can to get the car on my own, but also not get killed on interest as I will have bills immediately, and loan payments to start paying 6 months after I graduate.

Any and all advice, as well as knowledge, is encouraged and welcomed. Thanks so much!

The lack of a retirement account bugs me, but my lack of an emergency fund bugs me even more.

I'll post a huge payment to a credit card, but then I can't pay for necessities and I end up using the card to make it to the next month. This way at least my payments are lower than I've been making, but they give me plenty of room to go out with friends in moderation and enjoy nice meals at home without feeling like I'm punishing myself constantly for life happening to me, plus the addition of 2 more very part time jobs that I don't depend on to make ends meet will help me get a safety net back.

finance,Conceptual Question Regarding Commercial Credit,"Setting up for the interview process at a middle-market credit analyst role and attempting to grasp a concept. So far I am able to divide the concept of an entity providing lending services to a business as follows:  

1. A bank underwrites a loan to a business with negotiated details including a fixed rate or a variable one tied to another interest rate such as inflation or LIBOR.  

2. In this scenario, the bank effectively bought a bond from the business, expecting a coupon payment every time a certain time period elapses as well as the principal at expiration.  

If my suppositions are correct, since we are entering a rising interest rate environment wouldn't a bank want to issue more loans for increased revenue? Would a variable-rate middle-market loan rate also increase? Do these type of ""bonds"" fluctuate with demand and supply? And in general, does the entity underwriting the loan have the ability to package the revenue stream into a security and place it into a portfolio?

Please correct me if I am wrong in any of the above assumptions, I would love to get a firm grasp of middle-market loan origination going into the interview process.

personalfinance,Savings Bonds for Loan Payoff,"I found a bunch of savings bonds I have from when I was young (1989-92 with a few others in the late 90s and one in 2004) totaling just under $8000. None of these have matured and most carry a 4% interest rate while some newer ones are only making 1.12-1.40% interest. From what I have read, correct me if I am wrong, but it would be in my best interest to cash these out and put it towards debt.

A little background, I make about 2k a month after taxes while brining some extra money in from mturk and other sources. I have about 3.3k in a savings account, plus my checking account which doesn't have much. About 6.5k total. Each month I pay $500 a month in multiple student loans with the highest interest rate being 6.55% on a few of them. I pay $350 each month for my car (a mistake I know, but I needed a reliable car to get me cross country and to and from work). EDIT - I currently have $9000 left on my car loan with a 3.99% interest rate. 

What are you suggestions for what to do with the savings bonds? I'd also like to add some point in the very near future I would like to open a Roth IRA. My current thought is to wait til January to cash in the bonds (I am a bit worried about the taxes) and use that money to pay off the car loan. This will give me an extra $350 a month, maybe putting $200 towards loans and the rest in to the IRA or savings.",finance,1409727669

personalfinance,Personal loan to pay off loan with HIGH interest rate?,"So to me this sounds like a no brainer, but I also don't want to rush into anything without backup for my plan, I was hoping you guys and gals could possibly help out.

Currently I am financing a car that has an amazingly high interest rate, because of some poor judgement on my part(I cosigned for someone) my credit took a big hit and I am currently in the process of rebuilding it.

About the loan, I still have $6,700 left to pay off over the next two years, today's payoff is $6,800, my interest rate is 15.860% and my monthly payments are $370.10.

If I took a personal loan through wells Fargo for $7,000 (a little over what I need I realize) and I got a half ass decent rate it would lower my monthly payments by up to $50 a month while maintaining (roughly) the same payoff date. This is all based off the numbers on wellsfargo.com which give an example of %9.8 interest, I realize my interest rate could vary.

Right now my credit score sits around 660, my credit card monitors it and says it's at 663 right now, though I'm not sure how reliable (I hope very) it is.

So...

1. Should I do this?
2. Do you think I would be approved for a personal loan through wells Fargo for $7,000?
3. Are the credit scores provided by a credit card company reliable?

personalfinance,Staying at home with the baby vs. Going back to work. Can you help me see the financial impact of either and/or both?,"What information do you need from me to help me sort through this? 

To start, I earn $2500 per month, take-home, and daycare for one child in our area is about $1700 per month for the first six months, and $1350 per after that (it changes based on the age of the child). 

My company is not likely to let me take an unpaid hiatus for the first six months, but I am going to ask. 

My insurance will increase by about $40 per month, and my gas will increase by about $150 per month. I believe my additional food purchases due to time constraints at home and customer meetings at work will add (conservatively) $200 per month. 

I live in an area with year-long paid maternity leave, and we would like to have a second child. If I don't go back to work, I obviously won't qualify for the payment for the second child, which is about $1500 per month after taxes.

My husband makes enough that we would get by without being paycheque to paycheque, but we would be saving a little less each year. We aren't really big on paying for trips and holidays, so that's not an issue. 

I feel like there are other financial factors I'm not thinking about; please enlighten me? 

The nonpecuniary major issue of note is, of course, time. We will be out of the house from 7:30 until 6:00 every day, on good days. We will have very little time with our baby, only an hour in the morning and an hour at night before bed (on weeknights). These two hours will be spent getting the baby ready for the day in the morning, and getting the baby fed, bathed, and to bed at night. We will only have ""quality time"" on the weekends, but due to the scheduling we'll have a good few chores to do on weekends. This is the tipping factor for me, if the financial side is nondeterminant. 

Please note I am not interested in cheaper daycare because it would be in the form of unlicensed home daycare and I am not willing to take that kind of risk with my child. We have no family nearby to help. 

I also would go back to work once our child is in preschool, and if we have a second child, once that child is old enough for preschool, so I anticipate no more than 5 years out of the workforce. I am a licensed professional and don't anticipate having difficulty finding a job later because there is high turnover in the industry, and there are often job openings. Furthermore, I would basically be guaranteed to get my current position back with my company if one were available, which is a bit of an if, but my specific position comes available a couple times per year, currently. 

What do you think?

It's too much, I don't know where to start! 

If I could just tell all my debt collectors to pause and I could pay them back one at a time, that would be great. But I can't afford to pay everyone, especially not the whole monthly payment! 

Advice!! Please!!

**update**
First: thank you guys, SO MUCH for all the advice, I really appreciate it more than you know! Just knowing I'm not alone in this makes the world of difference. 

Second: 
Here's my budget: 
Income: I work a full time job, I make $13/hr as a line cook at a local upscale restaurant. My paychecks vary between $750-850 every 2 weeks. 
My bills/debts: 
Monthly: 
rent-$454
car insurance-$205
car payment-$126
phone bill-$107
gas-est. $70/mo.
credit card-min. balance est. $50/mo but I try to pay more (currently owe $5300, while the max is $5000...sooo...little overmaxed out...)
groceries-this varies. My fiance has a 7 yr. old son, so as much as I could live on rice and chx breast, the child (and quite honestly, the fiance) want/need more. :/ I could live off &lt;$100/mo. (working in a restaurant helps! free food!) but that's not reality. We probably spend $300/mo. 
Student loans: 
loan 1: $50/mo (income based repayment plan)
loan 2: $85/mo (has been deferred many times, but I keep doing it!)
loan 3: recently I was contacted by a collection agency saying they were collecting for a loan, when I asked for them to send me the paperwork regarding the loan, they said they couldn't b/c my mom was the one who originally took out the loan for me so they could only send it to her, but she lives quite far away. I thought it was pretty sketchy but I didn't know how to approach it. They continued to blow up my phone, calling several times a day and now have recently stopped...which relieves me, and scares me...
Vet bill: this is from a previous pet which is no longer with us, but I owe around $200
IRS: State: $200 Federal: $500 :( 

AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING my car started acting up last week and I have to take it in and get it looked at!! 

Luxuries: 
smoking: est. $50/mo
drinks after work: est. $40/mo. 

My fiance makes about $18/hr, so he usually pays for our excel energy bill, our comcast bill, he'll buy beer and groceries and take care of things because he knows I can't afford it. He pays his bills, we share some, and I pay mine, which I think is fair. I hate asking him for money, but as of late, I've really had no choice.

financialindependence,"Massive debts, no clear way out","The last 2 years hammered me, I lost a very well paying job and went from a upper-class pay level to unemployed and then stayed there off and on for more than a year total over the next 26 months. I managed to get a couple of gigs but they were short term contracts that lasted just long enough to get my head above water before the rug got yanked out from under me. A major problem I had was that at a mid-career level, I was finding that I was competing with people far more senior than myself for positions. A real crappy situation to be in with a family of 6 to provide for.

The bitch about the whole thing is that 2 days before my first lay-off, my wife and I were in the new home show room picking out the cabinets, flooring and other options for the new construction home we were under contract for. Had I been able to actually get in that house, my total monthly bills would have dropped by a good $500 a month in both housing and utilities costs. 

Thankfully I had a solid 6 to 7 months of assets that helped keep me afloat the first time. By the third bout of unemployment, the unemployment payments were gone and I was no longer eligible... My family was living off the goodwill and retirement accounts of relatives and food stamps. Not a situation I ever thought I would have to be in.

The other kicker is that I had to stop working towards my Masters degree and I am only 3 classes shy of finishing it. Really just one left credit wise, but to graduate I have to get my GPA up a tad so I have to retake 2 classes I got C-'s in.

It seems that has turned around a bit now and my current job has solidified me into a decent career where even if this position ends, I should be able to get into another one without too much down time.

So, my immediate financial needs have now been met for the time being, now it is time to fix the damage.

The good thing is I managed to keep my car payment and a small unsecured credit card paid mostly on time during the ordeal.

First, I have a few delinquent credit items from a couple of revolving credit accounts that I could not keep up with... They are a fairly small amount but are now almost a year old and some show charged off on my credit report.

Secondly, I have a sizable amount of student loan debt. My totals listed on studentloans.gov exceed $150k and I have private student loans that are larger than that, I believe those totals are nearly $200k. The totals are large enough that the interest alone is more than I could pay in a month. All of the loans are long past the point of being able to be deferred and the private loan companies are unwilling to do anything except call me and demand payment. The federal loans are currently set aside due to my income based repayment based on my income of $0 that ended last month.

Finally, my wife has some defaulted federal student loans from long before her and I got married. They are not anywhere near as large as mine but the IRS will seize my tax return every year if I do not fill out an Injured Spouse form.

I am at a point where I really do not see a way out short of either 1) hitting the lottery or 2) landing a job that gets me a 150 to 200% salary increase.

I have been thinking that I probably need to work with someone who is both a financial planner and a credit pitbull... Someone that can both help me ensure stability in case of another bout of unemployment and that can look at my credit situation and tell me which items to ignore, which ones to pay off, which ones to dispute and which ones to sue...

She has (by herself) paid off all of her old debt/etc....

So with that out of the way, she got a good used car, with a poor interest rate. Her credit is honestly pretty poor (but it's getting better with time). My credit rating is ""decent"" (730) so my auto loan is around 2.5%, her's in 13% (yeah I know, but she got the car a while back). It was a 10k car, but her payments are so high due to the interest im guessing.

That being said, could I refinance the loan in both of our names (me as a co-signer I guess?) Would it use the higher person's credit? 

While we are married, we both handle certain things seperately (IE our cars/personal items, we pay for ourselves, joint things we pay for together, even if we paid for them together....lowering the car interest would help both of us)

I realize if she decided not to pay it would be my responsibility. But I guess that being said....what would be the best way to go about this. I completely trust me wife, and she's not a spend freak or anything, she is actually quite frugal in the past 4-5 years as she has learned from her mistakes.

Like lets pretend worse case scenario, I would need to be able to ditch the car and sell it, and put that towards whats left on the loan (6k or so).

My mother had a few surgeries in June due to complications from gallstones, which included gallstone and gall bladder removal. She had just signed up for a new insurance plan through the ""federal healthcare exchange"", which took effect in January. She just received a claims summary from her insurance company that states that the insurance company, essentially won't pay for any of the charges; only one procedure was a part of an exclusion (gallbladder removal), the rest of the charges are grouped under this exclusion, regardless of the fact that many of the other charges are not due to the exclusion for gall bladder removal. The total bill is about $83,000 of patient responsibility for four days on hospitalization, two surgeries and one hospital transfer. 

We have submitted an appeal to the insurance claims department and my mom has filed a complaint with our state insurance commission, due to the fact that when she called to discuss the matter, she was informed that her particular insurance provider was not even licensed to sell policies in our state. She also contacted both hospitals to see if she can qualify for financial/patient assistance, however, she was told that her income is too high, despite showing all of her expenses vs. income, not to mention her income is significantly below the median income for our state. The hospital stated that she would not be able to receive any financial assistance, but that she would have to make a $15K down payment as ""good faith"". 


While we are waiting to see how it will work out with our various attempts at appeals and financial assistance, my mother is very concerned about losing her home and other land assets.

**Her debt**

* *Student Loans: ~$58,000 at 8-9% interest*

    She still has a couple years of grad school remaining so I expect that number will grow a bit.

* *Personal Loan: ~$50,000 at 3.75%*

    This was a loan from her father that was used as a down-payment for a house. It is to be paid out over 25 years (23 years remaining).

* *Mortgage: ~$200,000 5/1 ARM* 

    I don't know the current interest rate but I know the introductory rate expires in 2017. If she moves out, her plan is to keep the house as a rental property for the foreseeable future.


**Her Assets**

* *Inherited Retirement Account: ~$178,000*

    I don't know all the specifics on this account but she said she is taxed 20% when she makes withdrawals from it. I know the account is being invested but I have no idea what kind of returns it typically sees.


**My Suggestion**

She draws on the inherited retirement account to erase her debt in the following order of priority: 

1) the student loans,

2) pay back her personal loan with her father, 

3) and possibly refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage.

After taxes I think this would still leave a cushion of around $40,000 in the inherited retirement account. This could be transferred to her own IRA.


Talking about money with her has been a sticky subject. She inherited the retirement fund after her mother passed. I think this means she has a very emotional connection to the money and is very careful as to what she spends it on. From my perspective, using the windfall to erase her large debts is perfectly practical. Am I missing something? Would there be a better way for her to approach this?

I have been lurking around for several weeks now, trying to work up the gumption to lay my financials down for scrutiny. Well, here I am, ready for my reckoning. I'd apologize for this being so long, but I have no regrets about it.

**Some background**

My ex-fiance cancelled our wedding 2 weeks before the date. All of our deposits were obviously lost, plus whatever we had spent on physical items. For ease (at the time), all of the expenses went on my credit cards. Yes, yes, we should have had savings already to cover things. But we (I) didn't, and now I'm saddled with the debt. My ex has agreed to split the costs 50/50 and is making monthly payments to me for the next several months.

In addition, I stopped contributing to my 401(k) about a year ago for what I thought was a short-term situation of being strapped for cash. I have regretfully not resumed these contributions since, and while I'm only 28, I know how time and interest work in conjunction. I am anxious to resume those payments plus contribute a bit extra to make up a bit for what has been lost.

I work a solid job and make a very healthy income. My ex was very spendy and liked eating out a lot, etc, and I think that greatly contributed to my current financial situation, because his income far exceeded mine and I didn't want to seem like a leech. 

I am honestly looking forward to a simpler life - becoming a better cook and spending more evenings at home with Netflix and Minecraft.

I have a plan that I'd love feedback on, as well as a couple of specific questions.

**Step 1: Sell off car, wedding dress, and engagement ring**

The car currently costs me $575/mo for the loan and insurance. I can sell it to a dealer for $1,500 less than the loan payoff amount. I have 3 options:

1. Eat the $1,500 and just get the damned thing out of my life
2. Try to take out a personal loan to buy out the title and sell it myself (Probably could turn a small profit)
3. Keep making payments for a few months until the offer and the amount on the loan are closer together.

The dress and ring would hopefully bring back about $4,000 to offset the wedding expenses. We haven't made a lot of progress in selling them, it's kind of hard to think about them. If anyone has any suggestions for how/where to sell them, that would be awesome.

**Step 2: Pay off credit cards - $2000/mo until sale of car, then $2500/mo**

This part is fairly straightforward and is pretty aggressive on my accounts. It does not allow for 401(k) contributions or putting away any extra money in savings. But even if I can't get any money for the dress and ring, it would finish paying everything off by April 2015.

My only question is: Is it worth consolidating this debt with a personal loan for a lower interest rate? How does a personal loan even work and where is the best place to look for one?

**Step 3: Restart contributions to 401(k) and begin aggressively paying off student loans/contributing to savings**

I will be so, so happy to get to Step 3, when I feel like I'll be done backpedaling and can start moving forward again. My only question is if there's any drawback to waiting to restart the 401(k) contributions. If I compare interest rates on my cards to my average rate of return, it makes sense to stockpile money toward the debt instead of putting anything toward retirement. I plan to contribute at least 10% (company match is 50% up to 6%) at this point.

**Step 4: Ride into the sunset while saving up for a home**

If my calculations are correct, I could be doing this by January 2016. Woohoo!

Federal Agencies Are Flooded by Comments on New Rules

WASHINGTON—The State Department received more than 2.5 million comments on whether to permit construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. More than 1.26 million people have weighed in this summer on Federal Communications Commission rules on how broadband providers treat traffic on their networks. At the Environmental Protection Agency, officials are sorting through hundreds of thousands of comments on new emissions rules for power plants.

Record numbers of online comments are flooding agencies at a time when Congress is stuck in gridlock and the Obama administration has turned to executive actions to achieve its policy objectives. The millions of public comments, many of them posted to government websites, come from groups with a stake in the outcome, organizations that rally similar-minded people to their cause and individuals who simply want to weigh in.

""The public has woken up to the potential of agency rule-making,"" said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates on privacy and Internet matters. ""The public has flocked to the agency rule-making process in the absence of real or anticipated action in Congress.""

Federal agencies have accepted online comments on proposed rules and other government proceedings for several years, but they say the past 12 months have brought unprecedented responses—numbers that in some cases have given them pause as they write final rules.

**FCC officials say privately that the 1.26 million comments received so far on their net-neutrality rules could well cause the commission to tweak its proposal.** The Sunlight Foundation studied the comments and found that two-thirds are opposed to the plan, which would allow broadband providers to charge some content providers for a faster lane to customers.

At the Internal Revenue Service, meanwhile, Commissioner John Koskinen has said the agency in all likelihood would revise its proposed rule to restrict politicking by nonprofit groups after a record number of people weighed in. Treasury officials have said the new rules won't be in effect until after the 2014 election cycle.

The comments include legal-brief type treatises from affected businesses and interest groups, form-submitted comments written and sometimes bundled by interest groups, and letters from interested Americans, ranging from thoughtful to flippant. Some of the submissions are just plain wacky. One person posted the entire text of Leo Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" on the FCC's Internet proposal.

The level of engagement suggests a broader shift in how the public attempts to influence policy. Experts point out it is easier than ever to submit comments online, and that the issues at hand are particularly controversial and ripe for online debate. In addition, ""clicktivism"" has become their primary outlet for political action, a trend that is reflected in advocacy groups that focus almost all of their efforts on spurring action via social media and e-mail.

""List-building as an outreach strategy has become a big deal, especially post 2008. Lots of these organizations are built around giant mailing lists,"" said Andrew Pendleton of the Sunlight Foundation, who has studied comments across a variety of agencies. ""It has become pretty easy for organizations to tap into these giant pools of constituents, send out a blast email, and tell everyone to go comment on this [rule-making].""",technology,1409792775
personalfinance,Advice about student loans please?,"I could use your advice about my future husband and my student loan situation. I graduated from law school in 2013. I went to a top law school but had a hard time finding a job, and went a year without steady, full-time work. I finally found a job (at the end of July) that I love with a non-profit and am making $60,000 per year. I am getting married in 3 weeks. My fiance graduated and found a job last year making $49,000.

Our student loan debts are outrageous.

I owe $223,000 at 7.4% interest from law school and nothing from undergrad. These are all federal loans. I am waiting for my consolidation to finalize now. I haven't started payments yet, but have requested the pay-as-you-earn repayment plan.

He owes $60,000 at 5.9% to the federal government and $20,000 at 9.5% to private lenders. 

We've spent the last 6 weeks paying off credit cards that we used while I was under-employed. Now, we plan on saving up a reasonable emergency savings account. We then plan on paying off his private loans. After paying our bills, mortgage, food, matching 401k contributions, and minimum payments on student loans, we will have about $3,500 per month left. Normally, I would think we should try to pay off our loans rapidly. However, at our level of income, we will never be able to pay off my loans. Because I'm working for a nonprofit (and plan to indefinitely), I qualify for loan forgiveness after 10 years. 

This brings me to my question: How do I balance the desire to pay off  my husband's loans while maximizing my forgiveness. Presumably, after 10 years my loans will be forgiven, but his will not. If we work to pay off his loans quickly (we probably could in 2 or 3 years), the minimum payments on my loans will increase. On the other hand, ten years of interest accruing on his loans doesn't sound like a winning game plan either. Should we save aggressively and then pay his off when mine are forgiven? I'm really not sure how we should best go about starting our lives together under this mountain of debt. Your advice is greatly appreciated!",finance,1409793779
personalfinance,Credit went from 770 to 580 in 3 months. 65k student loans 15k credit cards. I need help.,"I got myself into a bit of a mess. Graduated with a worthless degree (biology) at a horrible time (semester after economy crashed) and worked in retail for a while until my loans came up which I couldn't afford. Went back to school, got more loans, got another degree. Less loans meant I had to put more on my credit cards for the second degree.

Now my grace period is up and I can't even keep up with the monthly payments for my credit cards. I'm finding myself using my credit cards to pay for my health insurance. The cards are staying maxed out...

I am sitting at 65k student loan debt (both fed and private) and 15k credit card debt (with APRs all above 25%).

The kicker is I had amazing credit for a person in my situation - it was nearing 800. Then the credit cards got maxed out while I was looking for a job. In a matter months my credit score has dropped below 600 even though everything on my record is perfect aside from high credit utilization. I tried to get help twice but both times they said they could not due to my low score. And those two hard checks hurt my score even more. Which makes it even less likely I'll receive help. It all seems extremely asinine...

I have a decent paying job from my second degree and I'm not really a big spender. All I really need is to consolidate both my student loans and credit cards into a manageable monthly payment without getting fucked in interest due to very recent bad credit. I work as an IT contractor and it's very likely within the next 5 years I'll be making enough to easily pay off all debts. My issue is getting to 5 years, right now I don't even think I can pay next months rent...

Can anyone offer some guidance? I've read all the articles and blogs etc but they all say the same thing ""you're problem is spending"". Yea because I didn't have a job and shit's not free. It seems prosaic but now my past debt is the problem.",finance,1409794172

personalfinance,A historical spreadsheet of Mortgage Rates vs. S&amp;P 500 returns I just put together,"Let me know what you guys think. It's very simple and obviously will not come close to including all the variables. I keep hearing that it is better to invest your money and not pay off your mortgage but from what I saw in historical interest rates and returns, that is usually never the case.

Mortgage write offs are a fraction of a percent off your rates and you need to beat your standard deduction which will not happen in many instances. Even if you do, the only difference you would be calculating is your standard deduction minus the difference that you beat it by since the original amount would have been deducted anyway. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/IPSaTIN.png) it is. The return on investment column is 30 years from the date you took out the Mortgage. If it hasn't been 30 years yet, it's just calculated up until 2014.",finance,1409802552
personalfinance,I've historically been pretty good with budgeting but 1.5 years of freelancing has blown out my debt and now I need some help,"NB: even though I list expenses/income from two countries, I've converted all amounts to USD for consistency's sake.  

**Background:**   
Up until March 2013 I was working steadily. Spent 1.5 years in 2010-2011 as a student / unemployed, but managed not to increase my debt thanks to savings from previous years. Started a decently paid job and worked on the side as a freelancer 2011-2013 and managed to pay down credit card debt a decent amount. I was on top of my budget and I kept to it. In 2013 I decided to freelance full time and move from my home country to the USA. I knew this would put pressure on my budget and it did. I'm single with no kids, so I felt like I could take the risk.  
 
**Current situation:**   
Get freelance work in both countries (NZ and USA, currently based in the USA). I've been earning around US$35k across all my clients in both countries. However that gets drip fed and I often have long periods of time with little income and it's then that I use my credit card for things like groceries or gas, car insurance etc when I need to. There may have been some entertainment as well. I've started a fairly (hopefully) lucrative consulting gig and I'd like some idea of how to approach paying down my debt while I still continue to earn wildly varying amounts of money. 
 

**Income**   
Consulting contract: 10-25 hours a week for the foreseeable future. US$60/hr for the first 10 hours and $45 for anything over that. It's too early yet to know how many hours I'll be averaging, but let's go with 15 hours a week or $825/wk gross. 
 
Freelancing: I've been billing about $3500/month gross (US) but averaging about $2500/month in incoming payments thanks to the huge lags in time between invoicing and payment, which I can't do much about. This will likely decrease as I commit more time to the consulting gig.  
 
**outgoing**   
Rent:   $817/month  
car insurance: $74.32/month  
utilities: ~$50/month  
cell phone: $60/month  
gym: $60/month  
  
Student loan - federal US: $135/month  (total balance somewhere around ~$25k @ 3%)  
Student loan - NZ: ~$65/month   (total balance ~$4,000 @ ~5%)  
Student loan - NZ: $350/month  (total balance ~$30k @ ~5%. I can change the amount of payments and lock in interest rates for as little as 6 months, otherwise the interest rate floats)  
  
Credit card NZ @ 24% - balance ~$1,600  
Credit card US @ 7.99% - balance ~$7,000  
  
I contribute 6% of my net NZ earnings to a govt run retirement plan called Kiwisaver, it is a mutual fund. Current balance around $10k. That ensures I get a maximum contribution from the govt at the end of the year. Because I'm self employed there's no employer match. I do not contribute to a US-based retirement fund, though I'm eligible for Social Security when I'm older (lol). I would consider investing in a 401k, but just seem to trust the NZ plan more than the US. 
   
I also put away 10% of gross in savings - though recently had to gut this when I had a particularly long stretch of time between payments from clients. I'm starting to build up again.

no renters insurance  
no health insurance

personalfinance,"A few questions, also just wanted to know what you guys think about my financial situation.","I'm pretty much on a fixed income, due to me being in the military.

Got a 4.24% interest rate (at the age of 20). Much better than most of the people I knew. I am currently paid off until next April ( I believe) on my car loan. The car now has 75k miles on it. (I drive a lot, to home and to see my fiance about 900 miles one way home, and 1400 miles one way to see my fiance). 

EDIT: $264 a month is my minimum payment for the car, or would be if I wasn't ahead.

My car insurance is high, $220 a month, because of three accidents on record (used to work long long hours when I was 16/17 during the summer) They were all small fender benders. I have my car insurance money for the next 7 or so months put into a savings account just for that. It's never touched.

I also have about $2000-3000 in savings in a separate bank account that is never touched, and actually never really looked at. I'm put $150 a month into that I never see due to direct deposit.

finance,I don't understand how Exeter et al. make any money,"More specifically, I don't understand the way that losses are analyzed to come up with the right intuitive understanding of ""net yield"".

personalfinance,Paying off a part of student debt with LOC?,"I tried searching but I'm having trouble finding the advice I'm looking for in my situation so I was hoping someone could help.

BACKGROUND: 

1. PRESENT/EXPECTED INCOME: 

I'm currently late 20s, single and presumably so for the immediate future, recently graduated from professional school and about to start at a job with starting salary of 85k in Texas (no state income tax, though the benefit is probably outweighed by property/sales), which provides benefits of full health insurance, bonus option (though I only think about 5k is guaranteed), 401k (matching), and guaranteed salary increase every year for 5 years at minimum of 3k with, as far as I can tell, relatively secure job prospects with the employer and for future transitions to other employers. After taxes, I will be making about 5k a month.  

2. DEBT: 

However, I have outstanding student loan of total 100k. 20k from my undergrad and 80k from grad school. Because I attended undergrad in 2005-2009, my interest on those are not too bad. I can deal with that. But, my graduate loans are another question. I took out 3 types of loans: stafford subsidized, stafford unsubsidized (they got rid of the subsidized while I was in school), and, due to my lack of foresight and a pressing need, grad plus loan, which bears an interest rate, at least at one point, of 7.9%. Contrast that to my other loans which are, I believe, at 6.3 or 6.8% at its highest. I took out a principle of 15k in grad plus loan and interest has accumulated on those while I was in school to the present rate of, about, 3-4k, I believe. 

3. PRESENT PLAN: 
with respect to my graduate loans, I was intending on making it a 25 year plan with a minimum payment of 560, and paying additional 400-500 a month by targeting the grad plus loan. (basically, I was going to pay off the same monthly cash amount to pay off loans as if it was a 10 year- this may be a dumb ass idea and I'm just completely missing a point as to the downside of this, but I was hoping to get rid of the grad plus loan and the switching out to the 10 year plan). 

ISSUE:
 
I was talking to my mother about my present plan. Instead, she suggested that she could help me out by taking an LOC on her home equity to help target my Grad Plus Loan. As far I can tell, based on numbers alone, this would be beneficial to me and I'm having a hard time, logically, saying no. Obviously, it would take me quite a bit to attack the principal of that loan while the other loans increase. I was thinking that if we did this, then if she just provided 10k or so, I'd be able to pay off most of the grad plus loan in one payment, and then from there, just pay off the remaining principle within a year while I paid her a monthly basis for the LOC payments. 

-&gt; Would this be a good idea or is it completely stupid? 

Admittedly, I've been kind of proud that I went to grad school and part of college on my own debt (... though I would have preferred not to have done this but here we are!) so I'm kind of hesitant about taking an LOC from my mom. But at the same time, it's really hard for me to say no to this. Even just 10k would provide me with a nice cushion and I'd much rather trade the 2-3% interest for the 6.8-7.8%. This is especially so when I already ran my monthly budgets last weekend and even if I were to pay off my student debt with 1k a month (10 year plan amount) and my other living expenses, I'd still have about 2.5-3k leftover each month, so I'm not struggling to make it day by day. Obviously, there's the risk that I may not be able to make payments and that unlike federal loans, LOC are not going to be as flexible with repayment schedules. Plus, prior to entering grad school, I kind of realized the reality of the job market and that I'd have to take debt, so I feel like I should just suck it up and continue on with my original plan. 

But, even if this sounds like a good idea, how should we proceed with this? Should it go as a gift since it falls under 14k gift exclusion, or should we set up a formal contract whereby she lends me the amount and she can claim the tax benefit and she pays directly into my loan from her account (allegedly, based on cursory internet research, she'd get a tax benefit but I'm not quite sure I understand it).  

Thanks and once again, sorry for the wall of texts... It's just that I'm trying to set up my finances properly and I sometimes go from ""THIS IS HORRIBLE! I'm going to die in debt!"" to ""eh, it's not bad for a start and proper planing."" Any other related advice would also be much appreciated!",finance,1409805098

(Note: amounts alternate between **€** and **$**)

I'm American but I've been living in Spain for about 3 years (dual citizenship, here legally, no issues). Upon arriving here in 2011, I had to work odd-ball jobs like teaching English in Spain and running an English summer camp for several weeks in the UK, all non-taxed income.  I was barely getting by on these incomes but never over drafted, always made all my payments, never starved, etc but I was not saving much.  I was always able to give steady/reliable private English classes for €15/hour to earn extra cash (very common in Spain for native English speakers), though because of my work hours now I can't give private classes unless I want to arrive home at 8:30-9:00pm and be completely mentally and physically exhausted.

In January 2014, I started working a job full-time job but switched jobs in mid-July for better prospects and more income.  I'm working at my current employer full-time; however, **I'm still in my probationary period until December/January and then they can hire me on permanently or not hire me at all (very important).  Until then it’s possible they can fire me at any point, also (very important).**  The previous person only lasted 2 months in the position but I feel like I fit in very well, I get along with my boss very well, I have the experience they need (I used to work as an executive assistant in the US), I speak English natively which is what this company needs, and I haven't fucked up like the previous assistant did.  I'm not eligible for Spain unemployment **yet** as I have not accumulated a least 1 years' worth of employment.

My only debt is 2 credit cards (info below) in the US, I have no income in the US, no debt in Spain, and I recently started using YNAB for my Spanish and American budgets.  I'm saving as much as I can, I've definitely tightened my belt, and I recently broke up with my boyfriend so no more frivolous spending with the boyfriend (tapas and drinks).

(Note: amounts alternate between **€** and **$**)

&amp;nbsp;

I'm American but I've been living in Spain for about 3 years (dual citizenship, here legally, no issues). Upon arriving here in 2011, I had to work odd-ball jobs like teaching English in Spain and running an English summer camp for several weeks in the UK, all non-taxed income.  I was barely getting by on these incomes but never over drafted, always made all my payments, never starved, etc but I was not saving much.  I was always able to give steady/reliable private English classes for €15/hour to earn extra cash (very common in Spain for native English speakers), though because of my work hours now I can't give private classes unless I want to arrive home at 8:30-9:00pm and be completely mentally and physically exhausted.    

&amp;nbsp;


In January 2014, I started working a job full-time job but switched jobs in mid-July for better prospects and more income.  I'm working at my current employer full-time; however, **I'm still in my probationary period until December/January and then they can hire me on permanently or not hire me at all (very important).  Until then it’s possible they can fire me at any point, also (very important).**  The previous person only lasted 2 months in the position but I feel like I fit in very well, I get along with my boss very well, I have the experience they need (I used to work as an executive assistant in the US), I speak English natively which is what this company needs, and I haven't fucked up like the previous assistant did.  I'm not eligible for Spain unemployment **yet** as I have not accumulated a least 1 years' worth of employment.


&amp;nbsp;


My only debt is 2 credit cards (info below) in the US, I have no income in the US, no debt in Spain, and I recently started using YNAB for my Spanish and American budgets.  I'm saving as much as I can, I've definitely tightened my belt, and I recently broke up with my boyfriend so no more frivolous spending with the boyfriend (tapas and drinks).  

&amp;nbsp;



###**USA debt:**
The debt is all old debt from many years ago and nothing new.  I do not go on charging sprees nor use it for incidental purchases anymore. 


&amp;nbsp;


##**GE Capital Retail Bank (now called Synchrony Bank)**
* *Balance:*	    	$2,673
* *Min payment:*	$84
* *Limit:*		$7,500
* *Interest:*		$2,301 at 26.99% and $372 at 23.99%



Before understanding avalanche/snowball, I was paying $150/month.




I was gifted some money recently and I'm putting that money directly towards this card.  A billpay of $1,584 ($1,634 gift money + $220 avalanche payment) is being sent on September 11.   I'm debating to bite the bullet to pay the remaining balance of $1,089 on September 11 also from a savings account I forgot I had in the USA.  These interest rates are the higher of my 2 cards, it’s outrageous, and I'm fed up with seeing this card and balance.  I'm willing to take out from savings just to never see this balance again.  I would keep this card open but with no intentions of using it.

&amp;nbsp;



##**Capital One**
* *Balance:*		$3,195
* *Min payment:*	$82
* *Limit:*		$4,800
* *Interest:*		17.9%


Before understanding avalanche/snowball, I was paying $150/month.  This month, I have a billpay for $82 avalanche pending to be sent.


Obviously, if I pay off the GE Capital card above, future payments for this card will be $300 (my monthly budget for CC debt).    I would keep this card open but with no intentions of using it.

I've looked into doing a balance transfer but because I don’t have a US income they don't even consider it.  Basically, it looks like I'm unemployed in the US. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###**Spain income:**


* *Gross:*	€32,000 annual
* *Net:*	€1,702 monthly


We get paid 14 times a year—once a month and then a second paycheck in November and June.  The November payment includes the amount for December also, they just pay it in November.  Obviously, I started working here in mid-July so I'll receive 2 checks in November.  This “extra” November check I'm calculating should be around ~€1600 net.  I'm also debating on whether to put this ~€1600 into savings/emergency fund or against the CC debt.

personalfinance,401k loan to remove huge credit card debt,"hey all,
  long story short: after a divorce i am left with about $20k in credit card debt. i have about 90k in my 401k, and i can take a 20k loan on my 401k to pay off my credit card debt. but im worried if it's worth it.


current credit card information:

Interest rate: 5.15%

Current principal balance: $20,000

minimum payment is $300

new charges: each month, there is $300 charge for some equipment purchased

for the past year or so, i've just been paying $500 each month. 


my monthly income is around $5100. a total of all montly bills(includes the $500 credit card payment) is about $3500.


the 401k loan is at 4.25% right now. i can 'model' a loan for $20,000 for 12 months(adjustable to 60) and the Repayment Amount is $786.33 for each Biweekly paycheck. i get paid biweekly, so i believe this means they will deduct $786 from EACH of my month paychecks. Losing $1600/month might be too difficult for me to sustain. while i do pay interest on a 401k loan, the interest is paid back to your own account [essentially paying myself the interest], vs. paying interest to a bank.

Banking,Types Of Bank Accounts | Trende News,"Having a bank account nowadays is more of a necessity than a matter of convenience and there are many different types of bank accounts to choose from.

Although different banks might have slight variations in terms of the services they offer, there are still four broad types of bank accounts that every bank account falls under.

CHECKING ACCOUNTS

The basic purpose of this type of bank account is to allow you to make transactions. You can write checks, make deposits and withdrawals and may also be provided with a debit card, which will allow you to perform some basic functions such as making payments and paying bills while you can be charged for excessive activity and transactions. Usually no interest is paid on deposits in checking accounts.

SAVINGS ACCOUNT

A saving account offers interest rates on your money and also allows you to make withdrawals and deposits but without the facility of writing checks. However there are a limited number of transactions and transfers that you can make each month. Additionally interest rates may also vary from bank to bank and can be compounded weekly, monthly or yearly.

CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSITS (CDS)

In case of a CD you commit with the bank to keep your money in your account for a specified period of time, while you are paid interest on your money. Because you cannot withdraw your money for a specified period of time the compensation in the form of interest rates is usually higher than interest rates in other types of bank accounts. Again the agreed period of time in which you cannot make withdrawals and the interest rates offered may vary from bank to bank but almost all CDs would work in the same way as specified above.

MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT (MMA)

A money market account offers you interest rates as well as the facility of writing checks. Banks usually require a minimum amount of balance in order to open and operate a money market account. Interest rates offered are usually higher than savings account and unlike other types of bank accounts where interest rates are fixed; interest rates fluctuate along with market interest rates. Also transactions allowed are limited with usually no more than 2 to 3 checks and 6 transfers per month.

The following table summarizes all the major features and characteristics for all the types of bank accounts mentioned above.

As we can see each type of bank account is designed for a specific purpose. That is the sole reason why some things provided in one sort of bank account is not provided in another. If earning a positive and secure return on your savings is your main aim then Certificate of Deposits is a suitable option but if only paying bills and making payments is what you want to do then checking accounts is what should suite you.

Finally we would recommend you to do some market research before you choose a specific bank. As mentioned before, almost all banks will be providing you with the all the features and services of a particular form of bank account in the same way as explained above. However the details are what makes the difference. The interest rates offered might be different for different banks, similarly the transactions allowed or the minimum requirements for a bank account will differ from bank to bank. Therefore you would want to make sure that the bank you select offers you the best deal and that you do not miss on the higher interest rate, or the flexibility offered in terms of account requirements that might just be available from the bank you did not considered.",finance,1409842795

personalfinance,"Being sued for $15k on an 12 year old debt that was originally $1,500. Need some advice.","Almost 15 years ago I purchased an special system for my house for $1500. The salesperson included a bunch of extras as part of the contract, and I she said I'd make x payments of $y to the company to pay it off. The system was installed, but it turned out most of the extras were nothing like what was represented by the salesperson. I made the payments, but it turned out that they didn't go to the company but to one of those revolving credit companies at a high interest rate, and so at the ""end"" of the term, I still owed the original amount according to the finance company. It also turned out that the company that sold me the device were not licensed to, and the 25year warranty that came with it was worthless because there sales  license had been revoked by their supplier before they sold me the device. The company that sold me the device were in the news for fraud and apparently had been prosecuted and lost, but I did not personally receive any info from them.

The finance company secured a mechanics lien against me at 7% interest years ago, which I was unaware of for some time. To the best of my recollection, I'd never directly signed a loan/finance contract with them (I suspect the sales lady forged the documents), but I did make payments to them. The finance company reported to the credit bureaus for years saying that I was making monthly payments of $100, but that I was in default--this was five or more years after I'd had any contact with them. It seems to me they were just ""refreshing the debt""? In any case, it eventually fell off my credit report but it did cost me years of bad credit and high interest rates, etc.

Now they are saying the interest has accrued to about $15k, and they say the have filed a ""complaint"" and are suing for that amount.

What can I do? I feel I need to get a lawyer, but I don't know what kind or how to find one?

personalfinance,Had a student loan sneak up on me - how much is this going to hurt?,"I'm not sure where else to put this, so let me know if it needs to go somewhere else.

This is a long story, so here's the short version:

I woke up today to find that my wages had been garnished for a student loan. It turns out that a collector had attempted to contact me (at my old address, so I didn't get the paperwork), and then set things up with my employer so that the garnishment began with this paycheck. What was weird was that I had never heard of this company before - I have an account with creditkarma.com, and not only had the name never shown up on my credit report before, but all of my student loan accounts are closed!

After making some calls, I was able to get ahold of somebody and found out that it was a debt that I had actually incurred - a $23k debt to the place I went to university. That had somehow never been brought to my attention or reflected on my credit score since 2008. Not sure what was up with that, but I did move around a lot for a while, so I could see it.

I have set myself up with the Federal Family Rehabilitation Act - unfortunately I'll be paying the garnishments on top of the monthly payments for five months - and everything looks like it'll be all right, though rather uncomfortable for a while. The FFRA means that I pay a small percentage of my last year's adjusted gross income for ten months, and when that is complete the loan is considered caught up, moved out of default and sent to a proper lender who will take up the debt from there. It'll also remove the mark on my credit from this incident.

So, I have two questions:

1. Does anyone know of some kind of law that I can use to ease this up beyond what I've already done, or do I just need to tighten my belt for a while?

2. I'm looking to get into the computer security field. Is this going to affect my chances of getting a job? I'm not sure, I was speaking with someone I trust at work and they said that, as far as our company is concerned, garnishment is a personal matter, but I understand that not all companies are so forgiving. Does it show up on a background check, or is it just reflected in my credit score?

Thank you all.",finance,1409853516

I have been using a high interest checking account for a few years, and was surprised how little discussion there was on this subject. I personally use Consumers Credit Union for my high interest checking account. Now granted there is a 10k cap and certain requirements to meet the 5.09% interest rate, and I'm sure some of you have such large amount of money that its not worth the time but I find that I am able to meet the 3.09% without breaking a sweat.

financialindependence,On track to retire at 40? Or am I dreaming?,"I’d like to present my spending and savings, and see if my goal of FI at age 40 is a reality or just a dream.  I’m currently 25 and make $60k per year.  I live in southern Indiana so living expenses are reasonable.

**Income, Savings, and Equity:**

Income: $60,000 per year

Current FI Savings: $2000 (Hey, I’m just starting out)

Current 401K Savings: $10,000

Home equity: ~$30k

After tax and deductions income per month: $3228

Expected Combined State and Federal Tax Return: $1732 (I’m particularly interested in if this is correct.  I am assuming $6100 standard deduction for a person filing single, and that this is coming from the 25% tax bracket.  Indiana has a flat income tax of 3.4%.)

Savings per month for FI to be invested in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund: $1150

401K savings per month: $525 (employer matches 50%.  This is already included)

**Spending per Month:**

Fast food: $70

Gas: $200

Grocery: $150

Restaurants: $100

Electricity and Natural Gas Combined Typical: $150

Cell Phone: $30

Internet: $40

Water: $30

Sewage: $45

Mortgage: $1015 (15 year mortgage)

**Yearly Expected Expenses:**

Car Insurance: $918

Home insurance: (included in mortgage payment)

Car Registration: $100

Car Maintenance: $570

Clothes and Shoes: $300

Yearly expected expenses converted into monthly allowance: $157

Fun money per month after all expenses: $237

What expenses am I missing?  Am I making any incorrect assumptions?  Is the government really going to give me back $1700 each year?

My current answer to this question is yes expecting 7% interest on my FI and 401K savings and 3% inflation, and for my house to be payed off when I retire at 40 (I’m on track for this).

This is what I hope for my annual budget at age 40, with all values in 2014 dollar purchasing power (if you want non-adjusted for inflation let me know, but I found this to be the best way to look at the values.):

**Age 40 Budget**

FI Savings: $281,854

401K Savings: $144,955

4% safe draw rule from FI: $11,274 annually

Required yearly income post mortgage: $11,636 ($400 annual difference.  I think there’s enough variability to account for this.)

And when I start drawing from my 401K at 60, I can expect this to be my annual budget:

**Age 60 Budget**

FI Savings: $281,854

401K Savings: $324,420

4% safe draw rule from FI: $11,274

4% safe draw rule from 401K: $12,976

Required yearly income post mortgage: $11,636

Total annual income: $24,250

What I know I haven’t accounted for is a wife, kids, increase in income from my job (I’m an engineer so I expect this to happen), new car purchases, and medical insurance once I’m retired at 40.

So is this a good plan?

**TLDR:**

Monthly Budget:

Income after taxes and deductions: $3228

Required Expenses: $1690

Fun Money: $237

FI Savings into Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund: $1150

401K Savings: $525

investing,Best sources of small business funding,"What are some good options for borrowing in the $90K-$100K range on a 5 year loan for business acquisition and expansion? I'd like to keep the interest under 10%, and I do have material assets besides the business (real estate) to use as partial collateral.

The back story: I currently own a business and I'm acquiring a second business in a market that is in the same industry as my current one, but not the same service (two different transportation businesses). I need to find capital, both to acquire the second business and to expand and integrate it once the sale is final. 

I've looked at LendingClub and Prosper. Prosper doesn't offer amounts that high, and LendingClub only offers high interest rates for that amount on a 3-year period. That would make the payments too high for me, because my business is steady but low margin. I've talked to my local banks, who referred me to the SBA. While I'm willing to work with the SBA, they're making me jump through what seems like an inordinate amount of hoops, and we've been providing them with documentation (both buyer and seller) for almost 6 months now. I have excellent credit and my business is in great shape. My main concern is that there are other buyers on the horizon and the seller is getting impatient. If I can't secure SBA financing soon, I will lose this purchase. We signed a purchase agreement, but the terms run out soon and they have the first right of refusal to not sign an extension if they have another buyer.

Any and all advice is appreciated.",finance,1409872261

personalfinance,Should I refinance my vehicle? If so...when?,"So, before I get into the question I will explain my situation in as much detail as necessary. This past March of 2014 I was hanging out with a few of my buddies and we were in our typical discussion of vehicles. At the time I was driving a 2011 Chevy Malibu. I chose the car because of the gas mileage it got and the fact I was driving to/from school 5 days a week on given semesters as well as working part/full time. I live at home (thanks mother) and because I was graduating that May I figured I would look into something that I wanted, a truck. 

Always have been a fan of trucks over cars and figured I would get myself a little graduation present. So, in just a couple of days I did some looking day and night and found the vehicle I wanted. Which one? 2012 F150 XLT SuperCrew. Love it. 22xxx miles on it. Price tag around $26,000.

On my car at the time I was into my 3rd year of payments, had about $12k left and was paying $331 a month on my car. I was making payments pretty easily even working part time. My part-time and now my full-time work is an hourly rate at $12 an hour. Sometimes that goes to $32 whenever we do certain jobs for the state. Occupation? Communications Contractor. 

At this point you're probably falling asleep so I'll speed it up. Went to go look at the truck. Trade in was about $1-2k less of what I owed, put 1K down and so the initial price of the truck came to be: $27,3327.29. Had to have mother cosign on the loan (only making $25k a year) and I had at the time some debt on two credit cards so my payment ended up being.....*drum roll.....$471.10! Ouch.

The salesman said in about 6 months I could definitely refinance and can get myself a better interest rate. After putting some thought I figured I should maybe wait a year and see what I can do there but I want to do it as soon as possible seeing that next payment would be my 6th month of payment on the vehicle. 

Interest rate was almost 7%....another yikes. I should also add that a few weeks prior to me getting my truck my mother just acquired herself a newer truck too. So her credit took a pretty good hit and her credit wasn't the greatest whenever she was my cosigner. In all I probably should not have gotten the vehicle but I just wanted a truck so bad I couldn't help myself...

OKAY! So now I've gotten into detail on some things I wanted to get someone else's opinion on the matter. So my question is when should I refinance my truck? I want to and I know I can get myself a way better interest rate but I'm just afraid I'll get turned down immediately and be stuck with this high payment for the next 72 months (now 66).

I have attached a cutout of my payment history (loan is through Chase) so you guys can see what I'm paying as far as how much is going to principle and how much is going to interest. Thanks you guys!

P.S. Not sure if it matters but I'm not entirely sure of what my credit score is (if that matters). Through my 4 years of owning credit cards (I'm 22) I've always been on time and have either paid them off immediately or at a pace that was comfortable for me, which is making payments above minimum. Anyhow, I'm rambling. Thanks you guys.

personalfinance,When would it best for me to cancel my secured card?,"**Hi, PF, long-time lurker, first time poster. Just so we're clear, I DID do a search on this and none of the results I pulled up were satisfactory, so here goes:**

A little over a year ago -- just a touch more than 16 months actually -- I got my first credit card from Capital One. You know the one by now, I'm sure. [Secured MasterCard](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capitalone.com%2Fcredit-cards%2Fsecured-mastercard%2F&amp;ei=Of4IVInaMoLOiwLo9oHQDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK5rKbwHR93uOikwhtD8umPkyhZQ&amp;bvm=bv.74649129,d.cGE). 

I have (so far [anti-jinx]) never missed a payment, kept my credit utilization down, and just used it like I would a debit card pretty much and it paid off. From ""no credit -- thin file"", I shot up into the 700 range after about half a year and regular card offers started pouring in.

After waiting a while longer, I finally applied for the Amex Blue Everyday about a month and a half ago and received my card the next week. Of course, I've used it pretty much non-stop since then in lieu of my secured card, which isn't necessary anymore.

Now, I know as a general rule, you should never keep a secured card any longer than you have to, due to the deposit, annual fees and high interest rates that make them pretty undesirable. BUT being as I already paid my annual fee about a month ago, I should be good for another year. 

So my question is: ***should I cancel it now or 6-11 months down the line***, when it might possibly help increase my average age of accounts and reduce the time for my score to rebound?

I feel like no matter when I cancel it, my score will invariably take the same hit for it, but I guess what I'm looking for is confirmation if that's true.

If the impact to my score will be the same now as it would be in 6-11 months, then obviously it'd be best just to cancel it now, right? 

Or is that thinking wrong?

I'm probably making this more difficult than it needs to be lol. But any advice is appreciated.",finance,1409876178

My one credit card from navy fed now has a balance of 1000 (5500 available) after about 8 month of slowly paying it down from ~4400. In that time i have applied for and recieved a 12500 NavyFed checking line of creddit, got my NavyFed car loan down to ~12500 from ~18000, and seen my credit score climb into the mid 700s.  Ive always had the goal of getting my balance down to 0 in the back of my mind, but now im not sure how much id really benefit from it.  If i can get approved for a couple new cards and maybe get some luv for NavyFed on my exsisting card then my overall available credit increase should help my score no?
 
my anxiousness has only been increased by my desire to propose to my girlfriend sometime before the end of this year.  As some of you may have seen in my last post in the relationship boards i am in the market for a ring.  I dont have the money to buy it outright, so a personal loan or a new card with a 0% APR period would be awesome.  Some of you may judge and say applying for/recieving/and instally maxing out a card isnt responsible whatsoever, and i would be inclined to agree.  But im in the military, and getting married would give me a signifigant pay bumb, that when paired with my current rent free living condition should allow me to pay off the balance extremely quickly.  I dont plan on making the military a life long career so some extra income over the next year and a half to help my GF pay off some of her student loans and my car loan would be awsome.

personalfinance,Proposition from my mother: manage-to-own her property or take 1/4 when she sells,"I have almost zero investment knowledge, so I would like assistance in a decision that has been presented to me. 

When I went off to college, my parents decided to purchase a home for me rather than pay for an apartment. It was a run down college town, so the house the purchased was cheap (3 year mortgage of about $40,000). They renovated the interior and I lived in it until graduation, renting out the extra room to friends by the semester. She continued to rent the house out after I moved to a few acquaintances of my then-boyfriend (who did not take care of the property).  

By the time they moved out, the home was completely paid off. My mother spoke to the title company and they said since the house had been purchased jointly between she and my father, if she were to sell she would only be entitled to half the money. My sister and I, heirs of my father, would be entitled to the remaining half. We discussed and she told me she would keep the house and allow me to purchase it from her as a private sale so I could rent it out/manage it, or she would sell it and give me my portion. 

The house has been empty for almost a year now, and in that time she has paid to have it to be re-roofed, the exterior be cosmetically repaired and re-painted, the interior to be repainted, and the tile in the kitchen to be redone. The property is 45 minutes away where I currently live. 

About me: I am 26, have a full time job making $66,000/yr, rent a home currently from my mother for $500/mo (she loves me, I know it's insanely cheap), am paying off my car (~$25,000 left), and have around $2,500 in credit card debt. If she were to sell, I estimate I would receive ~$8,000 (possibly more due to the upgrades). If I purchase it from her, I estimate I would bring in ~$200/mo for the length of the agreement, then be free to sell or continue renting. 

Please let me know if you need more information, any advice is welcome. She's asking for a decision here in the next month, so I'd really like to be wise.",finance,1409887430
personalfinance,Refinancing my student and auto loan?,"I have an investment portfolio that receives 6.99% return.
An auto loan that receives 6.69% interest.

I've only been paying since November of last year, but I want to refinance and increase the term to lower the payment. What about consolidating my student loan into one and reducing the monthly payments by extending the term?

The general concept I'm going for is that if I can reduce my payment per month and maybe get a better rate on my auto loan, then the money I would be normally using to pay those loans down could be used in an investment portfolio and receive a return higher than the interest rates I'm incurring therefore netting me a gain on a per dollar basis. Just trying to make my $ be all it can be.

personalfinance,15yr or 30yr mortgage refi?,"Hello.  First time poster here. I have recently found this site and enjoyed learning about the philosophies and ideas talked about here.  I would like some opinions on a refi loan i'm thinking of doing. I've been trying to calculate this so long, I can no longer see the the forrest for the trees!  First off, my situation:  I'm 45 years old and working a good municipal govt job that pays about 100k/yr.  I'm divorced with no children and no financial obligations to the ex. I have saved an emergency fund, have a decent pension waiting from me when I have to retire in about ten years and am even contributing to a 457b deffered comp plan, although I have not contributed as much as I would have liked because of past debts and living expensives.  I have reduced my monthly spending and lowered my debt to just my mortgage and a small credit card balance which I pay off every month. 

My question is this.  I've decided to refinance my house before interest rates go up.  I have 19 yrs left on a $141k loan with a 30 year mortgage @ 5.00%.  After 11 years, I still owe $111,000 principal plus about 61k in interest.  My original goal was to try to pay off my mortgage quicker so I can shave off some of the total interest paid and shorten the amount of time I have to pay for the house after I retire in 10 years since my income will be reduced. My current lender is offering my a refi deal of 15 yrs @ 3.625% with 4k closing costs rolled into the loan.  I would save about $34k in interest.  This would have me own my house by the time I am 60 and ensure I stay in this house for a long time.  I'm not sure how I feel about that honestly.      

Well now I learned about another option.  I could refi into another 30yr loan with a 4.5% rate.  It would lower my payments which I could use to invest and double my 407b contributions, which is tax deferred. I could also opt for a cash out refi which would pull my equity out of the house.  I would probably use it to put back into the house for much needed maintenance and invest the rest.  This would be essentially a cheap loan if rates go up. I would just sell the house when I retire and move somewhere cheaper so I don't pay another 20yrs of interest.  This is more risky but would give me more freedom to move around If i want to in ten years and have more money now instead of when I'm 60ish. 

I've gone back and forth with this but would like to hear someone else's take if for any other reason just to get an outside perspective.  Thanks.",finance,1409899171

First off, thanks for all your help. I'm a frequent reader on this sub but now I need some advice of my own.

I'm 23 and I've been working full-time since Jan. I pay rent, I live decently, and I've been setting aside $500 a month into a savings account hoping to grow a nest egg. My savings account has a .97% interest rate (Ally bank) which is pretty much nothing but is somehow leaps and bounds better than many others. I just took a look at the account and I see that I've made ALMOST $1 in interest in the last few months. I'm now wondering whether such a low interest rate is worth not having the cash at hand since I'm pretty disciplined anyway.

Bitcoin,"How Bitcoin ""Smart Contracts"" Would Have Saved Harvard University over $1 Billion - and why they should adopt them now!","In the 2008 to 2013 period, Harvard suffered huge losses due to their exposure to interest rate swaps which were used to swap floating for fixed interest rates. Things went downhill when the rates started to collapse and Harvard got a massive margin call on the swaps.
To limit its exposure to the interest rate swaps, Harvard took offsetting swaps, paying a huge premium to the other party. Harvard’s total losses look something like this…
Loss to Harvard = Loss of value of extant interest rate swaps + Premium of Offsetting Swaps + Penalty / charges payable to the swap issuing entities (JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley)...

Although loss of value of swaps due to adverse movements in interest rates couldn’t have been avoided, Harvard could have certainly avoided the huge (and we do mean… HUGE) premium that JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley charged them for offsetting the first swap. It could have also avoided the penalties and other charges it paid on the first swap.

* Used state-sponsored first mortgage program (Minnesota)  
* Home is in a historic brick converted condo building  
* Current total payment is $1180/month, including $81 PMI, escrow, etc.

* $130k in retirement accounts  
* $25k in brokerage  
* $45k in checking/savings  
* No other debt besides mortgage  

Other considerations: 
 
* May need to buy a new car in the next couple years  
* Would like to move to a single family home in the next year or two  
* Really do enjoy living here, but I know I could be paying much less with the right loan  
* Very comfortable financially overall.  I like to have the flexibility of liquid assets, and put a premium on that, over things like real estate.  

As far as I know, HARP cannot help because the mortgage is not government backed, and my only options are to refinance by paying down to 70% or 80% LTV (requiring $40k-$50k payment to do that).  That would put me at a very good interest rate on a new 15 or 30 yr fixed loan.

My options (I think?):  

* Do nothing, and either continue paying the mortgage and/or buy another place and rent it out until value increases or HARP 3.0 passes  
* Pay down $40k or $50k so I can refinance, but then I'm out all that cash that could be used for other things.

 In the US. I can get 0.5% for regular savings through my credit union and 1% with a money market account.

personalfinance,Marriage for the sake of tax benefits?,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I want to bring up a topic that I haven't really found to be discussed at all on this subreddit but is still nonetheless just as relevant (if not moreso) as far as saving money and budgeting are concerned: tax minimization.

My personal situation: I am a 23 year old fresh out of graduate school working in the semiconductor industry, and I am in a salary bracket where a full 35% of my income is being withheld and subject to stringent federal and state (Massachusetts) income tax. As someone who is just beginning to build savings and assets, I feel as though minimizing my tax contributions should probably be an effective way of increasing my total take-home salary. Given my current status, I get hit by basically every tax penalty I am aware of: I'm not married, I have 0 dependents, I don't drive a hybrid, I don't have business expenses, and so forth.

I have a few friends that I have discussed this with (libertarian nutjobs/""enthusiasts"" from New Hampshire who like to conceive of any way possible to avoid paying taxes), and most of the suggestions I have received regarding tax minimization involve starting a small business on the side wherein I would open myself up to certain tax writeoffs. This seems like a rather complex endeavor that would take up more time and effort, and I am seeing that most of the tax deductions tied to running a small business are expense related--mileage and so forth--I am discarding this idea for the moment. I certainly don't want to do anything of dubious legality, so I don't know that this would be the best option for me. That being said: if you have any advice or feedback on this topic, I would certainly like to hear it, but it is certainly not the point of this post. So I need to explore other ways of minimizing salary loss due to taxes.

For the sake of completeness, I know people are going to mention 401k as a means of circumventing taxes. I am aware that another means of minimizing (or deferring, more relevantly) tax contributions is through dumping salary into a 401k or Roth IRA. I am aware of this and am already contributing in an amount such that I get the maximum contribution from my employer. No, I am not at the Federal cap, but I have my own personal reservations on storing assets in a retirement fund since I find more value in raising my present standard of living, investing in a house, and so forth. I have a very high stress and unhealthy lifestyle, so I don't expect to reap retirement benefits, but I will definitely have a sizable 401k just in case I don't croak early enough. But let's not talk about 401k and retirement tax deferral options here, please.

Just looking at what you indicate on your W2 or when you file your taxes, it appears that the #2 component (after actual earnings) is relationship status/whether you are filing singly or jointly. What if I could put myself in a more favorable tax bracket by getting married and filing my taxes jointly with some other individual?

Question 1: Is there a strict tax advantage to filing jointly versus filing individually? What are the conditions that determine whether the answer is yes or no?

Question 2: I have read about a ""marriage bonus"" which applies in the case of two individuals with very disparate incomes. Does anyone have any insight regarding quantifiably how much this is?

Question 3: This is a marriage that would exist solely for the sake of tax benefits. I would find someone with optimal economic status for me to maximize my gains (once I have all the details sorted out), and we would only meet once a year to file taxes jointly. Is there anything illegal about this sort of endeavor? I know that people abusing marriage for immigration is illegal given that it is more common, but this is a sort of thing where I only collect benefits as long as the institution lasts, so I would have no qualms about keeping the marriage going for as long as possible. Just like any typical unhappy marriage, right? :)
 
Question 4: What sort of liabilities do I open myself up to by doing this? With regards to existing finances I feel as though I would be somewhat safe because I don't think that a spouse gains access to my bank accounts, credit lines, property, and so forth. But do they gain some sort of legal jurisdiction that could come back to bite me in the ass? If they acquire debt do I become responsible for it? I know there's the risk with the whole divorce splitting assets sort of thing--could that be remedied with a prenup or some other sort of contractual obligation which maintains that our finances remain separate?

Thanks guys. I know that this question might appear ridiculous or far-fetched, but I am genuinely curious what sort of ideas are out here on this matter. Reading over my post I realized that perhaps the scope of this question is more legal than financial--in which case I will gladly take my question to a more appropriate subreddit as per your recommendations--but I do think that this issue is most relevant to personal budget since you guys are the ones who probably have the most experience as far as observing tax changes due to your own marriages, etc. I'm looking forward to hearing what you have to say.

personalfinance,Finally caught a huge break - how to tackle 4.5k CC debt?,"Hey guys,

I'm using a different account for this, as a lot of people know my username and I do not want them to see this :).

I am a college student from Germany and due to an accident I could not finish my bachelors degree on time. I had to put in one extra year and lost my scholarship and the federal support (depending on your parent's income, the German state gives substantial amounts of money to every student enrolled in a university). That year was hard as f***. I lived on 580$ per month that I earned at a part time job. Rent alone is 500$, so yeah - not cool.

What I did was maxing out my credit card (basically for food and things I had to buy, like a pair of boots for the winter season etc.) while working my butt of to get into a good masters programme, which worked! The Gov will found me with 580$/month. Today I learned that I qualified for another scholarship, which will pay 580$ per month for 2 years. I will continue to work 50 hours per month, which will yield another 580$. The master starts in October. The money will come in at September 30.


My fixed costs are about 580$/month. Add to that food costs at 350$. My income is 1750$ per month. My Credit Card debt amounts to 4400$.  


I think it's clear that I need to get rid of the debt as soon and as fast as possible - however, I desperately need a few things. I want to repair my mobile phone (display is broken and I can barely use it anymore, can't answer calls, can't type certain letters), I could really use some new shirts, shoes and I will need a laptop for university. The luxury of a new pair of headphones would be nice, but as I'm typing I realize that this last one will remain a wish until the debt is paid back entirely ;).


Do you have any idea on how I could efficiently work the debt while introducing at least some decency back into my life? Or would you say, screw it, it's just a few more months of frugality and then you're off the hook?


Btw, yes, I know, my problems are probably cute when compared to others. However, I'm not living somebody else's life, I have to deal with my problems - and I'd really like your help if you can and want to offer me some! Even though a lot of people here have to deal with far worse situations.

Thank you!",finance,1409953977

personalfinance,Changing my claims on my W4 - Did I do it wrong?,"So after lurking a long time on /r/personalfinance and reading more about how much is overpaid in returns and such I decided it was time to change my W4 allowances.

I'm not a bad saver so I don't feel like I need to worry about having the tax refund be my ""savings account.""

personalfinance,Savings vs hassle with credit card,"This is probably a trivial question for this sub, but I appreciate the focused outlook around these parts and would still be interested in /personalfinance 's take.

I'm considering applying for a Walmart credit card because they tend to give 15 cents/gal discounts during large span of the year and I go through a good bit of gas, so this could easily add up.

On the other hand, I already have a good credit card and have no pressing need of another except for this discount. Also, this promotion is also valid with gift cards at a rate of 10 cents/gal instead of 15 cents/gal. The Walmart card  would give me $5 back every $500, but it also has a substantially higher interest rate than the card I already have. However, I don't see this as terribly relevant as I have never *not* paid my balance in full each statement.

So, I could definitely save some money with it. Do you think the hassle of the extra card is worth the savings, or would it be better to go with a gift card?

personalfinance,How much money should I have in the bank before purchasing my first house?,"Hello Reddit,

I'm about 4 months away from finishing my undergraduate degree and am hoping to purchase my first home within the next year. I currently have about 30% of the purchase price of a decent starter home in my area in the bank (due to an inheritance)...about 50% of a condo if I decide to go that route. Interest rates are at a historical low at the moment so my parents are urging me to purchase instead of rent after I graduate. If I buy a small house, I'd be looking for 1-2 tenants to help offset the costs. I live in a university town and would probably be able to find renters relatively easily. Also, this would give me the option of having an income property down the road. I have a boyfriend as well who would potentially move in with me and pay me rent, but I know not to depend on that. 

Basically, my question is, how much money should I have in the bank before I embark on this journey? I'm lucky enough to say that I have 100% paid for my university education and bills (no debt), but a) don't have very much money in the bank right now (except my inheritance) and b) won't necessarily fall into a career job right after I graduate. Grad school is another option in fall 2015. Between my two part time jobs, I currently make about $1000 a month. I can get pretty close to full time hours at these jobs after I graduate, but I'll only be making about $12-$13/hour. I'll hopefully have about $2000 saved by January after paying the rest of my outstanding bills for the semester.

I got an internship at some known web search company this past summer, which came with a relocation bonus (almost equal to my gross wages for the summer) that was withheld for federal income taxes at 25% despite my best efforts. NY(C) income taxes were also withheld, but I'm a FL tax resident and will file a non-resident NY return, so I expect to reclaim (most? all?) of the NY(C) taxes.

I expect to get a refund of about 3-5k depending upon how much of the NY(C) taxes I get back, but I have enough spending money for now, so this would all go to a 529 I'm thinking of opening for myself. However, I have to put money into the 529 to get a bigger refund so I have more money to put into the 529...

personalfinance,Wife just completed medical school.....to forbearance or not to forbearance?,"So, a bit of a quandary here and not sure what to do.  So, my wife recently graduated medical school.....almost all of it on student loans.  She is currently in residency making around 53k a year.  We file our taxes separately to avoid jacking up her income based repayments (I make more than her and filing jointly would raise our IBR something like 1100 a month up from 400). 

We are considering forbearance for her medical loans as we have other, more high interest revolving accounts to payoff.  The one thing holding us back is that she is currently doing her residency at a 501c3 (non profit).  When she is done, she will have 5 of the 10 years of required for Federal Debt forgiveness.  So, if out of residency, she goes to work for a 501c3, we could in theory be out of debt by just making min. payments for 5 years more.  

The problem is that there is no guarantee we will go to a 501c3 after graduation.  Sure it'd be nice, but we are looking for location first, quality of life, good pay.  If, for example, if she had two job offers roughly equal, but one was a 501c3 and one wasn't, we'd take the 501c3.  But, we won't be actively seeking it out.  

My guestimate is over the next 3 years and change, we'd be making around 400 a month in payments, roughly 18000.  Is that worth paying for the ""chance"" that we will find a 501c3 in an area that we want to live  in and pays competitively with other hospitals?  The loan(s) are just under 500k at the moment.  My non financial mind says that, if there is  just a 5% chance we find a 501c3, that we should forgo forbearance and keep the payments up.  However, ASSUMING my wife will be making booming attending money, we will be making the actual student loan payment, not the IBR....so the loan won't be 500k by then,  it will be much smaller when its actually ""Forgiven""",finance,1409971449

Bitcoin,The general advice has been to only invest a little...,"""what you're willing to lose"". It's true, this is an experiment... as the holder's of our personal private keys to wealth (even in this arbitrary manner through the use of a digital token), wouldn't it make sense to make these keys as valuable as possible. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate what the legacy banking system has done for us so far, in terms of laying the basic groundwork for ""global commerce"", but this technology is leaps and bounds better. Here's everyone's concern, they want to make sure they ""cash in"" on the next ""bubble"". If we want mass adoption (and we as a community really really do), we have to convince the masses that if they use Bitcoin, not only will they be empowering themselves (by being directly responsible for the keys to their own wealth), but that that same wealth won't erode, but grow over time. For some people, it truly will take an(nother) ""economic collapse"", to wake up to the massive spell the banks have cast, and when it happens, we can be there with open arms. Let's make this experiment successful, and let's not limit that definition to the price of bitcoin. Rumor has it that here in America the Federal Reserve (our central bank) will begin to ease off of Quantitative Easing (3), and begin to raise the interest rates for borrowers. It's been speculated that, because most of that money never truly ""trickled down"" into the ""real economy"", we the common citizens will never truly benefit from the Feds program. I'd like to make a suggestion to the Bitcoin community as a whole, and that would be to purchase as much Bitcoin as you can, up through, and beyond any impending (weeks away) ""economic collapse"". The banks may collapse, but Bitcoin will continue to survive, not only survive, but thrive. When the people of the future look back at this time, let's give them a good story. We didn't let banks ruin our livelihood, we as a global community thrived, despite all the greed around the world. Let the banksters have their Monopoly™ money.

I've made a total of 5 payments on my student loans, all on time, and my credit rating, I believe, is 680.

My original purchase price of the home was $335,000, but refinancing the loan will bring my new loan amount to $336,000+.  I've already been here a year and I feel like I would be erasing the last year of payments.

He said I was getting a 2 point discount and the apr would be somewhere around 2.35%.  All the above chart shows me is over 3 years and I'm curious if anyone else has had a hybrid ARM before that could let me know how their mortgage changed after 3 years as a result.  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/scmwBIz.png) is the included info from the Docusign packet he sent me that talks about a Hybrid ARM.

The interest rate is tied to the 1 year treasury bond which is currently at 0.11 and is 2 points lower from a year ago.  How exactly does this work?  What should I be looking at in the futures market for this bond value?

* The closing cost of 8,191 put my borrowed amount over the original purchase price.

* I have a low fixed rate currently, but this loan could fluctuate at most to 6.75% within 8 years.

My SO recently decided to go to grad school to get a masters in SO's field of study.  It's the right choice (opens doors, increased salary, etc.).  However, we've run into a small snag.  SO's plan is to work full time and take one class per semester as a part time student.  Each class costs about $3,800.

SO originally was told that employer would pay for up to $4k in tuition/training per year (resets every Jan.), so we figured that this semester's tuition would be covered.  Turns out that getting anything over $3k approved takes weeks/months (wasn't told this), and tuition is due on Mon. or Tues this week (can't remember which).  Result, we're about $900 short on tuition.

Because SO is part time, doesn't qualify for any federal loans.  So the way I see it, we have two options: (1) private loans at around 8-10%, or (2) pay the $900 from our emergency fund.

I'm leaning towards option 2 only because of the simplicity of it.  I know it's not a true ""emergency"" but I would prefer not taking out a loan for $900 at let's just say 10% interest.  However, an added wrinkle is that SO's employer has a tuition repayment plan which we might be able to apply for in April to get the $900 in loans repaid (we aren't sure of all the details despite trying to find out more b/c apparently we first need a loan).

politics,The Slow Death Of Unions - Or Is It Suicide?,"I guess it's no use directing this to those who put no store in the 8 hour day, 40 hour work week, workplace safety, child labor laws, equal pay for equal work, paid sick leave, paid vacation, and pension plans. If not for collective bargaining, however, none of these would exist for the vast majority of all employees - Union members or not.


But despite all of those shared benefits, you are convinced that when a Union man gets a dollar raise it comes out of your pocket. I know I can't convince you to the contrary.


It may not bother you that negotiated benefit packages are being cast aside in courts despite only one side having failed to uphold its end, or that corporations are writing laws restricting the forming or joining a Union. I know my breath is wasted.


To the rest I'll confirm what you already know - as Union participation has decreased so has compensation for all workers. The middle class is disapearing while upper-level pay packages and corporate profits have soared. When an employee does get a raise it bears no resemblance to his increased productivity.


US Unions, with a brilliant history of raising standards for all workers, their families, and their children, are in decline. What's going on? In 2013 there were 14.5 million union members in the U.S., compared with 17.7 million in 1983. In 2013, the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States was 11.3%, compared to 20.1% in 1983.


To get a broader perspective one would have to go all the way back to 1947 and the passage, over the veto of then president Harry Truman, of the Taft-Hartley Act. Workers, as would be assumed, had been very supportive of the war (WWII) effort. Post war, though, brought the expectation of demands deferred and a flood of former soldiers back into the labor market. Taft–Hartley was a means of controling labor by imposing limits on its ability to strike and keeping any communist influence out of leadership positions.


Fast-forward to president Ronald Reagan's scorched-earth handling of the Air Traffic Controllers (who had backed him for office) strike in 1981. Reagan not only broke the strike but the Union was forced into bankruptcy, many of the strikers were jailed, and all were banned for life from their livelyhood. In 2003, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, said of Reagan's actions, ""... gave weight to the legal right of private employers, previously not fully exercised, to use their own discretion to both hire and discharge workers.""


And today, if you are employed in one of the 24 states that has passed a Right to Work law, you cannot be required to join or pay dues or fees to a union. That sounds reasonable until one realizes that if you resign from union membership and stop paying dues, you are still fully covered by the collective bargaining agreement that was negotiated between your employer and the union, and the union remains obligated to represent you. Any benefits that are provided to you by your employer pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (e.g., wages, seniority, vacations, pension, health insurance) will not be affected by your resignation.


You read correctly, the Right to Work law actually offers a free ride on the gravy train.


In fairness, it's worth mentioning, 26 states do require public-sector workers such as firefighters, police officers and teachers to pay partial dues, often known as “agency fees,” to the unions that negotiate their contracts and represent them in grievances. But the Supreme Court has indicated a willingness to nibble away at those exceptions, notably in its June 30 decision on Harris vs. Quinn.


Even without going further into its history we cannot be surprised if Unions suffer a bit of Stockholm Syndrome. Unions have few friends among corporate-dependant congressmen. And it's a fact, Unions haven't had a real friend in the White House since Harry Truman.

I'm not going to let Unions off the hook, though, simply because they've been used and abused. They have neglected, perhaps rejected, their core message - ""in unity there is strength"". Their stick has been whittled to a twig, but I'm not seeing much carrot in its place. Yes, Taft-Hartley prohibits sympathy strikes and boycotts, but it cannot deny displays of solidarity. There are 101 unions in the US, some independent, most in affiliation with the AFL-CIO or the Change to Win Federation. What, we may ask, might be the impact if those 101 Unions acted in conjunction?


- On July 18 the union, National Nurses United, coordinated a demonstration in Detroit to get water service restored to thousands of city residents. They were joined by labor, environmental, and community activists. 3,000 people participated.


How many more might there have been if the Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Federation of Teachers had shown up?


- On Sept. 4 the Service Employees International Union sponsored sit-ins and protests in over 100 cities calling for $15 hourly wages for fast-food restaurant workers.


How many more cities might have been represented if the United Farm Workers, the Sheet Metal Workers International, and the Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees had been involved?


You get my point. Unions and union members should be the first to recognize the critical importance of actively working together. I'm not at all suggesting individual unions and their membership should back campaigns they disagree with. I am emphatically saying they should be backing campaigns outside of their immediate focus. It's not as though there is dirth of potential targets.


Voter Suppression and fair elections


Net Neutrality and community broadband


Money=Speech and Corporations=People


Global climate change


Wealth inequality


These are just a few important issues which impact the lives of us all, and the vast majority of us are in agreement how we feel about them. Unfortunately that majority is being ignored, subjugated and intimidated.

Where to go, what to do?


Forget the politicians and forget the courts, forget the uber-rich and forget the mega-corporations. Forget them why? Because we need more bulk to face the Goliaths. It is the apathetic and the willfully ignorant who are currently the greatest stumbling blocks to positive action on these concerns. We need a public education blitz like this nation has never seen. We need people in the street, teachers on the campus, talking heads on tv, chalk on the sidewalk. We need creativity to rival Eden.


And who is better equipped to promote and coordinate that challenge? Who should best be motivated to get the ball rolling and to stick with it 'til it roils like a mighty wave? Who can say with authority, ""You come out for us, we'll come out for you? I'm not saying spend big bucks, but rather expend big energy. If unions aren't professionals at organizing and energizing I really don't know where to turn. We, the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed just need a beacon.

Well, after some extensive research we're planning to move our checking to Charles Schwab, savings to Barclays, and will be applying for Sallie Mae, BCP, and Barclay's Arrival cards.  All of these will be joint accounts.  My question is, does it matter who applies for the accounts if we plan to make them joint accounts anyway?  (Btw, we plan to do all this within a 2 week period so as to protect our credit against too many inquiries.)

We both have excellent credit.  I'm now managing the finances since he's apparently allergic to paperwork, bureaucracy, etc.  All credit cards are joint and paid off as of last month (YAY!!).  Mortgage for ~200k in his name, but both names on title.  I have $2,500 left in student loans.  He makes $80k in wages; I manage our ~$50k of rental income (but deduct the shit out of it come tax season).  Joint tax filing as of last year.

Does any of the above matter when it comes to who applies for these accounts?  For the credit cards, I want the best interest rates/limits possible, of course.  I also know that he'd rather not deal with customer service (like if they ask to speak to the primary account holder.)

personalfinance,How best to pay SO's grad school tuition?,"Trying to figure out what is the best course of action in this situation and could use some help from /pf.

My SO recently decided to go to grad school to get a masters in SO's field of study. It's the right choice (opens doors, increased salary, etc.). However, we've run into a small snag. SO's plan is to work full time and take one class per semester as a part time student. Each class costs about $3,800.

SO originally was told that employer would pay for up to $4k in tuition/training per year (resets every Jan.), so we figured that this semester's tuition would be covered. Turns out that getting anything over $3k approved takes weeks/months (wasn't told this), and tuition is due on Mon. or Tues this week (can't remember which). Result, we're about $900 short on tuition.
Because SO is part time, doesn't qualify for any federal loans. So the way I see it, we have two options: (1) private loans at around 8-10%, or (2) pay the $900 from our emergency fund.

I'm leaning towards option 2 only because of the simplicity of it. I know it's not a true ""emergency"" but I would prefer not taking out a loan for $900 at let's just say 10% interest. However, an added wrinkle is that SO's employer has a tuition repayment plan which we might be able to apply for in April to get the $900 in loans repaid (we aren't sure of all the details despite trying to find out more b/c apparently we first need a loan).

Thoughts?

Bitcoin,Charlie Shrem- Martyr or Villain?,"Charlie Shrem, past CEO of BitInstant and Vice Chair of the Bitcoin Foundation, is the newest casualty of the Silk Road fiasco. 

Shrem, 24, is up for trial this coming January after having pleaded guilty to aiding “co-Conspirator” Faiella in obtaining bitcoin (which would eventually make its way to the Silk Road.) 

The case against Shrem is not nearly as strong as the case against Faiella- Faiella, after all, did actually have a hand int he cookie jar when it came to funneling bitcoin through to the Silk Road. 

Shrem, it seems, is being made into a martyr in the payments and financial innovation industry. 

What the government is ignoring: the Silk Road is a black market. Black markets exist everywhere. And oftentimes it is USD that is used in transactions! Why? Because USD does not have a “paper trail,” to be perfectly blunt. USD dollars can disappear into someone’s pocket and re-emerge years later to purchase a lollipop, but the time it spent folded up under a seat cushion or in that back pocket it was “off the grid,” unseen and seemingly unmissed while still being counted as part of the economy’s financial market. Back to the point: black markets exist, whether we want them to or not. 

So what makes the Silk Road the focal point of the federal government? For one, it’s the single best “anti-bitcoin” case out there. Want to scare people away from something, keep them from adopting a new technology? You make them fear it! You make them hate it. You string up the leaders like poppets and make them into the boo-ed villains of villages bygone. You certainly make sure that no one understands it. So governments send out a flurry of messy information, stats, and propaganda- then string up some “faces” of a revolution and demonize them. Successful deflection. 

What makes this martyrdom especially disgusting? At least when Christians were being thrown into the ring with lions and gladiators, they were truly “guilty” of being Christian. Excuse my religious reference, but Christian martyrs are an excellent example of what…. a martyr…. is! Charlie Shrem happened to be operating a business (much like many others in the space) that allowed people to get hold of bitcoin. What those people did WITH the bitcoin… is another story, and anyone who has studied economics in WHATEVER school knows that consumers either behave rationally or irrationally, but regardless, they have agency in their own spending/use of assets (unless we are talking about taxation and programs like such denoted by social contract theories.) 

By the rationale the government is using, the Lehman Brothers should have gone out of business long ago, brick and mortar banks shouldn’t be operating and their CEOs should be behind bars, and all investing activities should be stopped because by GOLLY I think everyone in the financial market in question has come into contact with at least $1 that has come through/gone through/heading to a black market of some sort. 

What do you think, is Charlie Shrem a victim or villain?

I just changed jobs and was in the process of rolling over my old 401k to my new company's 401k plan. However, I was wondering if it would be more worthwhile to take the tax hit and get a distribution of the money to pay off my higher interest rate student loans.

As it stands, I have roughly 75k in student loan debt and I can get back about 10k once the 20% has been withheld for taxes. My two highest rate loans are 8.5% and 7.75% - the 10k I'd get back would be enough to pay them both off and would lower my monthly student loan payments by 100 bucks (which I can use to pay off other loans).

My main question is, if I were to do this, would there be other taxes that I'd have to be aware of? I plan on contributing to my new 401k plan immediately (at a higher rate than I was before). Given that I'm 26 (and quite a ways off from retirement) and have money in an IRA at the moment, I feel like I'd be better served paying down my debt now.

personalfinance,[Canada] Borrowing against primary home to buy a rental,"So I re-mortgaged my house with a different lender a couple months ago to take advantage of the really low interest rates offered right now.


The bank had to get a 3rd party to appraise the house and turns out it is worth roughy $60K more than what I owe on it.  I am in the process of saving for a downpayment for my next house and either turn this one into a rental ( on the fence because I think it may be harder to rent this 3 bedroom house in a small town), or sell it and use the money towards buying a couple smaller rentals.


I am at least another full year off from saving enough money to move from this house into my next house, so I was wondering if it would be a better idea to just borrow against this house to purchase a rental now while rates are still low, and then next year sell this house ( if i decide this house is too difficult to rent out due to it's size) and take the money and use towards a second rental.


My original idea was wait until I have enough money to purchase my next house, either rent or sell ( and purchase 1 or 2 rentals with the money I made on this house).

personalfinance,I'm 21 with a little over 10k in debt. Please help!,"Forgot my password so had to make a new account. Bummer.

A little background... last year I had surgery, was out for two weeks,  putting me behind in school. I eventually dropped my classes and am now stuck with two student loans. On top of the medical bills and student loans I have about 3k in IRS debt. My employer wasn't taking out federal withholding and since I was young and didn't know what that meant...well I got screwed over.

At this point  I have $10,200 in overall debt. My fiancé and I have a apartment with our lease up in a few months want to work toward getting a house. With my current job it would take me over 27 months to pay it all off, and that's making the minimum payment for each item. 

I feel overwhelmed, stressed, want to pull my hair out! Should I get a loan to pay it off or should I break it down one item at a time?",finance,1410138177

I took some pictures so you guys can reference it. I went to nursing school at a private school and has some loans. I know I can pay off the loans, I just need to know the best way about doing it. 

- I just recently obtained a job with a salary of $50k a year. 

- It is estimated to go up in 6 months to ~$70k. 

- I am also trying to save for a wedding and I need to relocate to another city soon, so I have to budget for that as well. 

- I was thinking of allocating $500 per month towards my loan. Just not sure which group. 

- There are [5 groups](http://imgur.com/Dg22K5W) within my loan. I'm thinking of paying off group C first since the 10 days interest is really high. 

- However, looking at the [interest rates](http://imgur.com/KUqVKZK), I realized that group C has a low interest rate, and that group A, D, and B has high interest rates. 


So how would you recommend me to allocate my $500? Should I put them all towards one loan? Or spread it out over multiple groups? Sorry if this has all be explained before. I'm just really confused and would appreciate any tips or advice. Thank you",finance,1410149761

So basically I want to get rid of the interest rates I pay every month. I’ll start with the highest balance cards.
 
Please don’t judge, I'm almost graduating college so I will eventually pay everything off.
 
Which card or cards should I pay off first? I’m thinking Chase #1 and Wells Fargo #1 because I pay such high interest fees per month due to an old balance but I just want other peoples opinions.
 
 
Chase #1
APR 18.99%
Balance 2,402 out of 2,500
Interest $39 fee every month and we usually pay $65 minimum payment (old balance, that’s why it’s high)
 
Wells Fargo  #1
APR 17.15%
Balance 2340 out of 2400
Interest $34 fee every month with a $50 minimum payment
 
Chase #2
APR 22.24%
Balance 1,136 out of 1,300
Interest $14.21 fee every month with a $45 minimum payment
 
Wells Fargo #2
APR 17.85%

Interest $4 fee and $15 minimum payment

Does it hurt my credit that now I've gotten approval through my credit union twice in the last 18 months but I haven't taken the car loan?

My current plan was to go to my CU and see if I can change the loan to a new car loan or get a new car loan. I plan on taking this to the dealerships to try and get a lower interest. I've heard the dealers are offering pretty good credit right now.

The car I was looking for was a 2012-newer mid size sedan (Altima, Accord, Camry) but the prices just seem outlandish to me for a used model in decent shape. I wanted to spend $12,500 or so on one of these used cars. I'm looking into spending $22,000 on a new car if I can get a 1% or less interest rate (Accord, Altima, Camry, Fusion).

personalfinance,Did I goof this up? I got whole life insurance for the kids as a way to save up for college. More details inside.,"I'm going to try and make this short, but my brother-in-law works in insurance.  He suggested I get whole life insurance for the kids as a way of saving for college.  I ran all the numbers on his computer and it seemed to check out.  I put in $100 a month in the insurance policy, and when they turn 18 years they can pull out a certain amount every year tax free to pay for school.  After they graduate the kids will ""take over"" the premiums into their own life insurance.  When they retire they can then cash out the life insurance tax free.  It seems great, since it takes care of college, is a way for my kids to start saving and compounding early, some advantages over Roth.

It sounded pretty good.  But I think I goofed.  I think I should have just put the money in a Roth.  The fees they take for the insurance is astronomical.  And when I question my brother-in-law he says that's normal, and just be patient.

personalfinance,"Need help with my specific student loans situation, mom is very uncomfortable (full details provided)","Background:

I'm an incoming freshmen at Drexel University. I'm doing a 5 year co-op program in computer science. During years 2,3, and 4 you attend school for two quarters (six months) and work full time at a job related to your degree for the other six months so when you graduate you have 1.5 years of work experience already to help you find a job. They have many partners in the city and Comp Sci is in high demand with last year being 3.25 co op job requests from companies for every 1 comp sci student and they made an average of $815 a week at these co op jobs. 


You only pay for quarters you are in school so year 1 and year 5 you pay for 3 quarters and the other years you only pay for 2 quarters tuition. I'm receiving $37,691 a year in scholarships and grants. And the maximum 5,500 in federal direct loans for a total of 43,191 a year. My first year will be more expensive than the next 3 since I have to pay for 3 quarters so the tuition and fees are 15407 a quarter for 3 quarters totaling 46221. Then room and board I have to be on campus the first year and I have to purchase their overpriced meal plan but after that I plan on finding off campus housing since it is much cheaper but for this year room and board and meal plan adds 4910 a quarter for 3 quarters. Making my total fees for the year $60,951. That leaves 17,760 to be covered in outside loans other than federal direct. 


However, you have to take the whole picture into account. For the next 3 years my tuition will only be 15407 X 2 = 30814. When I'll be receiving 37,691 in scholarships and grants! Off campus housing down there I often see go for 500$ a month instead of the ludicrous room and board on campus. PLUS I'll be working full time for 6 months hopefully making somewhere around that average weekly pay of my peers. And this goes on for 3 years until my last year which becomes 3 quarters expensive again. But I'll undoubtedly have extra income to pay off some of the loans from my first year right? 


Drexel's a highly respected school in Philadelphia and Computer Science is booming so I think I'll be able to do very well after I graduate. Many of the co ops hire you if they like you after you graduate too. 


I think I'm lucky to be receiving this amount of aid for such a good school. I got many of it in scholarships for high grades and ap classes, but also because I live in a single parent household with an income around 40k and no child support (my father passed away). My mom is very worried because I want to cover the rest with Parent Plus loans but she already has a lot of debt from credit cards, house, and car and lives paycheck to paycheck so there is no room at all if she had to make any payments at any time. She thinks this is way too much for my first year and that I'll have to end up taking more out each year too and when I graduate I won't be able to live on my own and have to live with my mom because I'll have racked up so much debt my payments could be $600-800 a month or something. 


Maybe someone here can help me with the math and see how much debt I could be graduating with and how much needs to be in Parent Plus loans and how much I could be paying off while in school on the co ops and whether all of this is reasonable or not and how to make my mother more comfortable with the situation or what else I should do and whats the best course of action because I don't want to screw over my mom with these loans. But also I have to take care of this asap because tuition's due soon. Thank you!

A little bit about me:

    Currently working full-time
        $3k month income after taxes, insurance, retirement contribution
        $750 disposable income out of the $3k (the rest used in rent, short term savings, etc.)
    Currently pretty stable financially
        Own a home that's being rented out for mortgage for the next two years
        No outstanding loans (other than mortgage)
        Currently have around $4k in savings account, $8k in relatively liquid brokerage account

A little bit about my situation:

    Taking night classes toward a master's degree
        Costs roughly $6k / semester
        Will definitely take $6k worth of classes for Fall and Spring semester
        May be taking $6k worth of classes during summer semester (making total per year roughly $18k)
    Firm is willing to pay for education
        Up to $15k / year, but paid out after I successfully pass the classes (meaning, I have to pay upfront, and then wait until the end of the semester to receive the check from my firm and then refill my bank account)
        Only after 6 months of being employed (which means, the first semester I'm paying out of pocket)
        Since I will receive more than $5.2k in education reimbursement, it will be considered taxable income.
    Got approved for student loan
        Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
        up to $20k per year (more than enough)
        annual interest rate of %6.21 that start accruing as soon as I take out the loan (since it is unsubsidized)

Questions:

    Should I take the loan?
    What are the tax implications if I take out a loan and pay it back?
        I know the interest on student loans are tax deductible
        6% seems very steep

The school is in Portland Oregon and the overall amount for the classes and equipment total around $12,000. I currently make around $31,200 a year and have a fairly good credit score.

personalfinance,Just got really pissed at my bank. Looking for options.,"Ok, here's the back story.... I've f-ed up my credit but I'm recovering. I have no accounts in collections, but I'm at 75% utilization of my credit ratio. I'm becoming much more responsible and have a plan to eliminate all my credit card debt in under 2 years, and have my truck paid a few months after that. If I continued with that trend, I'd have my house paid off in 5 years from now. My recent promotion an pay raise helped.

I recently got two low balance ($500) rewards cards. One under my wife who has a bankruptcy from 2007 and one under myself. We are looking at using these cards for everyday expenses in order to reap the rewards so to speak. One way we figured that we can learn to keep these under control and train ourselves is to open a second checking account and do several transfers a week from our main account to the credit card account in order to remove the money that has been spent on the cards so we can pay in full every statement month.

The secondary account I was looking at was Ally. No fees, no minimum balance, everything looked golden. Asked about the ACH transfer (bank to bank) and found that they have a limit of 6 transactions per month. I'm looking to do at the VERY least 8 transfers a month at the beginning (don't judge, I know my habits and know what I need to do to break them). Ok.. No big deal... Ally supports Popmoney with no fees and no monthly transfer count limit count.

Here's where the rage comes in. My current bank charges $0.50 per Popmoney transfer.... Ok, my bank also allows ACH transfers between banks. Go to the online banking website... Transfer limits and fees may apply, click here for more info. Click there, contact customer service for fee and limit schedule. Contact customer service... after several minutes of NO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT POPMONEY... ""Oh... we actually do allow for transfers to other financial institutions. There are fees and limits associated with that, but I can't tell you what those are until you actually schedule a transaction. They're dependent on the transaction itself and we don't have a standard fee schedule.""

WTFBBQ I want some ribs!!!

That's enough to make me say goodbye to a bank I've had and respected for 8+ years.

The problem is I have my mortgage ($78k), my original debt consolidation loan (~$7k), and my auto loan (~$9k) all with the bank, all with interest breaks for auto debit.

Like I said earlier, my credit is a mess. My credit karma score is 663. My wife's is higher than that in the 670 range.

Am I being too upset at my current bank for not being able to tell me the fee and limit schedule until I have a transaction scheduled?

personalfinance,When to Consolidate Loans?,"The situation I am in is like this:

9 loans, varying interest rates. 





Amount | Interest Rate
------|-------------
$22,250.00 | 6.55%
$5,588.31 | 6.55%
$400.00 | 4.00%
$2,000.00 | 3.86%
$7,500.00 | 6.80%
$3,751.00 | 4.50%
$3,500.00 | 5.60%
$5,500.00 | 3.40%
$5,500.00 | 3.86%
$2,000.00 | 6.80%

The two loans at the top are mine, the rest are my Fiance's.

I'm figuring it would be a smart move to try and consolidate my two loans and her 7 loans from a cash flow perspective. That way instead of 9 payments each month we only have 2. However, I am very new at this whole game and don't really have any idea if this is a smart move at all.

If I don't consolidate, I have a plan of attack for which loans to pay first (highest interest rate, followed by lowest amount) but the minimum payments would be killing us here. Especially on stuff like the 3.86% on 5.5K. I'd love to leave that loan for last so I could get after the 7.5K with 6.80% interest, but minimum payments won't allow me to do that.

So I suppose my question is this: Would it be worth consolidating these? Is there any penalty I should be watching out for when consolidating? What disadvantages does this offer over just making 9 separate payments on these?

Interest rates of various loans range from 12% to 6%

Income based repayment monthly amount around $400.


It is my understanding that I can apply my monthly payments to the principal of whichever specific loan I choose. My plan is to apply the full amount of each monthly payment to the principal of the loan with the highest interest rate first, and then work my way down to the lower ones. Apparently if I just make a payment without specifying how to apply it, it just goes towards interest. Does this make sense as a strategy?

I am a 24 year old who recently was lucky enough to find a job, which means I am faced with paying down my student loans. I am completely at a loss as to how to pay off my debt in the most efficient manner possible. Here's a little bit of history of how I got to where I am now.

I went to University for five years (4 years Bachelor's, 1 Year Master's) and racked up $32,000 in federal and provincial loans. I come from a single parent home and my parent has a disability, so I had to do everything on my own. I also have long term medical problems, so this prevented me from being able to work while going to school. 

Once I graduated it took me a couple of years to get on my feet. I worked as a freelancer in the film industry and invested a significant amount of money into equipment ($15,000). I also recently went through a divorce and my ex occasionally helped me out with rent, so it has taken me a few months to get back on my feet and adjust to my new expenses. 

After these months of struggling I was lucky enough to find myself a full time job. Now that I am in the position to support myself, I am looking to pay off my debt. My parent has always been absolutely terrible with money, so I am seeking your help because I have no idea what to do.

Here are my ""specs""
-$32,000 in student debt (5% interest)
-$19,000 in personal debt from a line of credit (4% interest)
-$0 credit card debt (yay!)

personalfinance,I barely make enough to live on (still under the Fed. poverty line) and I'm being hit with wage garnishment for student loans. What are my options?,"First some background:  I graduated college with a BA in History and ~$40,000 of debt in federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans in 2011.  From then until last November I was only employed for 8 months and only made minimum wage during that time.  

I was able to make payments at first with my parents helping, but it was unsustainable and the amounts they were asking were more than I was taking home every month.  I applied for forbearance several times, but after a while they got more and more aggressive saying that the forbearences were applying retroactively and only bringing me current and that I must pay the full amounts due from there on.  It was totally impossible as I was unemployed, going without food, and struggling to keep a roof over my head.  The whole situation was overwhelming and coincided with a couple of deaths in my family.  Taken together I became very depressed and just gave up on trying to talk with them and hunting for work became even more difficult.  

So now I've been trying to get my act together.  I've been a Loader at UPS since November of last year.  It only pays $10/hr, but I take every hour and minute of work I can get.  So far this year I've made $9,784.72 and payed $1,090.69 in taxes and $700+ in union initiation fees and dues.  It had just gotten to the point where I could reliably cover my rent, food, car insurance, and gas.  Although they have cut everyone's hours recently.  

On my last paycheck of $320 (which was a good one, now with my hours cut I'll be seeing more like $220/wk) I saw another deduction ""Wage ATT 2 $48.40"".  Firstly, How can they do this to me?  I'm below the Federal poverty line.  Is there anyway to make it stop?  I'm not trying to squirm out of paying them, I borrowed the money and its not their fault the degree didn't pay.  I just can't afford to survive with this sort of bite out of my weekly check.  I wasn't expecting it at all last week and barely made rent and didn't have enough left for food or gas.  

Secondly, I realize that I let this get out of hand by ignoring it, but at the time I was too weak to fight them on the pay the full amount point.  There has to be a way I can make them recognize the financial reality of my situation.  Is there something I can do or ask for that would make them accept a smaller monthly amount or even postpone further payments until I'm at least making enough to live?  

If nothing like that can be done what are my options?  If I can't do something about this I can't see how I can continue living and working as I'm as low as I can go and don't have anything or anyone to fall back on.",finance,1410297645
personalfinance,How Aggressively Should I Save for a Down Payment in a Very Expensive Area?,"I am an attorney with a relatively high income, but I live and work in a very expensive area.  I am frustrated that despite having earned a substantial salary for quite some time,  I do not yet own my home.  If it were not for my failed first marriage—which I ended in part because of my ex-wife’s profligacy—I believe I would be in a much better financial shape.  

I am now remarried and expecting my first child in a few weeks.  I recently finished paying alimony to my first wife, and have paid off approximately $120k of my student loans, leaving $30k at a variable 3.5% interest rate.  Other than my student loans, my new wife and I have no debt, $200k in retirement accounts, and $70k across various non-retirement savings/investment accounts.  On months when I do not have significant non-recurring expenses / emergencies, I am able to save about $4-5k per month.   I anticipate that I will receive a bonus of $100k at year-end. 
 
Because I work very long hours (often 70+ hours per week), I want to live within a 45 minute commute of my office or I will never see my family.  As a result, the housing options available to me are very limited (read:  expensive).  A 2-bedroom apartment will cost approximately $700-$900k.  A 3 bedroom apartment or house will run about $900k - $1.3m.  Conservatively, I can afford a monthly payment of $6-7k.

I have enough cash to pay off my student loans in full, but am inclined not to do so unless and until interest rates begin to rise.  Although they are variable rate, the rate is based on 3-month LIBOR and resets quarterly.  So I would have lead-time to just pay them off if rates spiked.  Thus, my plan is to keep paying a set amount ($500/month) that will pay them off in about 7 years and devote the remainder of my excess income to saving for a down payment.  

1.	It seems to go against prevailing wisdom to save for a down payment rather than pay off the remainder of my student debt.  Does my plan make any sense?  

2.	It looks like I could get a mortgage on a $900k house with about 15% down, which should be attainable within a year.  But I could get a better rate (about 1% lower) if I came up with 20% down.  To do so in next year, however, would require taking a loan of $30-50k from my 401(k).  That strikes me as a bad idea, but would be interested in the crowd’s wisdom. 

3.	Student loans aside, it seems like I may want to wait on purchasing a house until prices rise:  the higher mortgage rates go, the lower prices will go.  And it is the down payment, not the monthly mortgage payments, that are the limiting factor in how much house I can afford.  Does that seem right?",finance,1410303635

Hoping someone can help me check this number crunching exercise below (based on round figures, and only for the tax-offsetting for now).  Please assume the tax brackets below are correct (filing jointly).

Net Income Under W2
------------------------
W2 Salary: 70,000

FICA (7.65%): -5355 

State Old (0%): -0

Federal (eff. 18%): -12607

Net (W2): 52038


In order to arrive at the same net --


Net Income Under 1099
------------------------
1099 Salary: 85000

FICA (92.35% * 15.3%): -12010.12

State New (5.64%): -4800.135 

Federal (18.79%): -15971.5

Net (1099): 52218.25


The above isn't accurate, since FICA and State are deductible from Federal, but that math is beyond my scope (I suck at math).  There are also business deductions, and S-Corp advantages, but I don't know how much of that I can count on.  For now let's assume I am going to be a sole proprietor.

Also, I still need to tack on lost benefits to that figure, including health &amp; dental (any idea on average cost to company?), or what other cost savings to the company I should factor in (worker's comp, unemployment taxes)?

Thanks in advance.  I don't want to be taken for a ride, but I also want to confidently go forward with a fair and accurate number.

/Confused Employee/

*UPDATED figures above for effective tax rates, so for tax-purposes only I need to make ~1.21x more for an equivalent figure.  Thanks for clearing up how tax brackets actually work :)  To make it more ""fair"", I'll need to add additional lost benefits + cost of living figures to that rate.",finance,1410308808

personalfinance,Quickest way to pay off $15k?,"Ok, so here is my situation:

 This spring I finished my first year at a top 20 university. My parents helped pay for the first semester but were unable to help pay for the second semester (sister was in hospital and my parents dished out a significant amount of money). Unfortunately, since I was attending a private university, I was having to pay roughly $17k a semester.


 I worked as much as I could over the summer but was only able to earn $3k. Since I needed to pay off the remainder of the previous semester before I could return in the fall, my parents agreed to cosign a loan for me. However, just before they sent in the loan application, my father unexpectedly passed away. With my father now gone, my mom told me that she was no longer going to be able to cosign for my loan.Since nobody would cosign my loan, I had to take a leave of absence from the school. 



 Now here is where the real predicament comes in to play. I want to transfer schools in order to be closer to my mom but I will not be able to. The University will not release my transcript to any other schools until I pay what I owe. I have talked with both universities ( the university from which I am transferring and the university to which I am transferring) and they both have told me that I must pay off my debts before I can get the transcript. 



 So here are a few of my questions: What would be the quickest way I could pay off that debt? Is there any sort of unique college ""loophole"" that would allow me to go to school without a transcript? Is there a way I can get a loan (without a cosigner or RIDICULOUS interest rates) of that amount?

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Confusion! What should I do?,"Hi Reddit! I'm going to be a college freshman this year, and my parents are making me take a Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan (rate 4.66%) that they will be paying off after I graduate. Of course, this loan is under my name, and I know it will be my responsibility if they fail this. I am taking $1833 a quarter for three quarters each year (my college runs on a quarter system) with monthly compound interest (unless either I or my parents choose to pay off the interest monthly).

Anyway, after 4 years it totals to $22,000 in loans. I'm very worried because I filled out the student loan government website's calculator estimator, and it said I would owe $44,000 after 4 years. Is it true that the debt will double after 4 years? I've called both my college and the Federal Student Aid Center, and neither could tell me (I was told by the Federal Student Aid Center that they can't see anything until after the first payment is dispersed).

Is this 4.66% interest annual or monthly? As I understand it, I owe 4.66% monthly on the amount dispersed so far. So, the first month I pay 4.66% of $1833, then the second month I pay interest on the $1833 and the compounded interest, etc. until the fourth month when I owe $1833 x 2 = $3666 plus all compounded interest. Would the cycle continue like this until I reach $22,000, making me owe $44,000?

This seems like a ridiculous amount and I'm guessing and hoping I am wrong.

Also, I will hopefully be taking 5 years for a Masters program so it might turn out to be even more loans later.

personalfinance,Process to take over my mother's auto loan?,"Hello PF,

Last month, my mother purchased a car for my sister with an crazy interest rate of 10.95%. I suggested that she refinance but because the vehicle was purchased very recently, chances are that she will not find a lender with her credit score.

However, 2 years ago she had also bought me a car at 4.79%. I have been making payments from my checking account for the past year now while the loan has been under her name.

I was thinking of taking over my car's loan which would most likely benefiting me because that will add a new type of credit line. This would reduce my mother's debt, decrease her utilization ratio, and possibly open up the possibility of finding another lender to refinance my sister's car.

How do I go about assuming the auto loan that I'm paying? I was told that I need to find another lender and get approved so that they will pay my mother's lender.

I did a quick application for BoA's auto loan and they list ""Dealer Purchase"" and ""Private Party Purchase"". Which one would apply for my situation? I ask because other banks/lenders have also listed ""Purchase from a Dealer"" but not ""Private Purchase"". Does this count as her selling the car to me? Would any additional paperwork need to be processed?

I'm just looking for some guidance/advice.

Thank you.",finance,1410350194

personalfinance,A few questions from someone from a 'third world' country.,"Hello everyone. I have a few questions. I went over the FAQ and other resources but still couldn't find anything that'd help me, so I am sorry if something like this has been posted before.

So, right now, I already have an emergency fund in place. I have a budget and a good portion of my income goes towards savings. I'd be interested in maximizing my saving potential. However, I live in a small latin american country (El Salvador, to be precise). Here, as far as I know, we don't have many of the financial instruments that go around here, there is no such thing as a Roth IRA. I can't use Vanguard either because I don't have a social security number and with similar services I find the same problems.

There exist some brokerage houses here, that allow me to invest in stocks. However, the ones that I have researched show limited options in the stocks you can buy. You can buy some ETFs (which, for now, would probably be what I'd be more interested in) but even then they only have some options (XLF, XLE, XLI, XLV, XLB, XLP, XLY). In common stocks there are also only some options that they offer. Even more daunting are the commissions of these brokerage houses: 20% of gains with a $50 minimum. Is it worth it?

One of the good things of living here is that the interest rates you can get in CDs is (I believe) better than what is available in the US. Interest rates here for CDs can go from 3%-5% in the main banks and higher in credit unions (5%-6.5%). I could (and probably will) keep some of my savings in CDs.

My medium term goals are to save enough for either a down payment for a house or as seed capital for other business ventures.

So, is the brokerage house here my only option? Is it worth it? Are there any other options available for me? Should I just stick with CDs and be extra patient/increase my savings.

Thank you, and like I said, I'm sorry if answers for these are already available, I couldn't find any.",finance,1410361040

Bitcoin,Are Bitcoins real Capital? or just money,"Capital is supposed to be the portion of the economy that has been earned, created, in excess.  This capital would be the savings accounts of the world.  In an honest system the only way to build a huge building would be for people to save up real capital, put it in a bank, and have the bank make an honest loan to a developer for building the building.  if it was a 1 million dollar building it could not be built without 1 million dollars of real money having been worked for and saved by people, who put it in a ""savings account"" that draws intrest as their return on the project that the banks has chosen to back.  If the project fails so does the bank, and so do the people who put their money in the bank.  It's true risk reward.  

Currently our system is far far away from this honest form of capital creation.  Due to fractional reserve you put 1,000 dollars into the bank, they can create another 9,000 bucks.  If you spend that on a car and the seller of the car puts that 10,000 in the bank, they can then create 100,000 more, and so on.  A sinlge savings account of 1,000 dollars can create several hundred times that original amount of ""money"".  They call it capital, but it's not ""earned"" money, it's just created and it dilutes the value of the real capital that is worked for, saved and invested. 

This dishonest system of capital creation is part of a multi-level system designed to debase our efforts to work and save, and it leaves us with a very few options, mostly to borrow money, spend it fast, and work hard to pay the interest.  

so is a 100 dollar bill ""capital""........... not really.  most of our money is ""fractional reserve"" creation, not a money that represents hard work and sacrifice. 

what about bitcoin..........is it capital??? 

is it the embodiment of hard work and effort?  you could say that miners put effort into bitcoin, and this it represents that effort and expense, and is therefore a reward for that hard work.  The bitcoin is sold into a free market of bid and ask, and only upon agreement of value of that ""stored effort"" is a trade made.  A miner gets to keep what he can in his/her operation to save and invest, but the expense part of the operation has to be sold to cover expenses.  These sold bitcoins represent the effort of the miner, and now after he sells them for dollars it represents the effort the purchaser put into earning the dollars.   

So I wonder about this...............wouldn't you say Bitcoin is real capital, real hard work embodied in our medium of exchange compared to the dollar that is just like extra shares of stock printed against the float, diluting the value of all other outstanding shares...... 

The dollar is a watered down capital where the FED gets to dilute it and compel us to spend now or suffer inflation risk, borrow now to gain from inflation, invest and work to pay interest and those who borrow big employ people who get sucked into the game at the bottom of the pyramid.  

If bitcoin can be proved to be honest ""capital"" then how on earth can you expect bitcoin to not go way way way up in value.  It would be like starting to mint solid gold .25 cent pieces and wonder if people would prefer that over the junk coins we have now.  The gold coins would instantly be prefered and traded at a higher value than a regular quarter.  

Bitcoin is honest capital with no fractional reserve currency or ""capital creation"".  

For this reason alone, forget the other advantages of bitcoin, but for this reason alone bitcoin is way undervalued when compared to what the economy is trading now as money.  

When people realize that bitcoin is honest capital that can't be ""created"" by banks the preference for honest capital will sky rocket compared to what in comparison is clearly dishonest money.  

If you asked me if I knew this a year ago I would have said yes,  but I didn't really see it like I do now.    I had the peices but didn't put them together into the larger picture.  

an economy can't grow without capital,  saved effort, the exces production produced from blood sweat and tears.   By the FED diluting our capital they dilute our efforts.  

so if you want your efforts to stand, if you want to work and have that effort be there for you when your old, you would simply be crazy to try and work for and earn dollars to save and invest into a system proven to dilute and steal your efforts.",cryptocurrency,1410366494

I am a third year medical student on the East Coast of the US with just over 220K in student debt. I was looking at my Sallie Mae account just yesterday to keep track of interest and I am following r/personalfinance's guidelines of attacking the highest interest rates first. I'll be able to do that after December when I finish paying off a 17% interest credit card balance of 4K. That highest balance loan is an almost 25K loan from my first year at 7.9%. Most of the others are lower at 6.4 or 5.4%.

I will likely have another 40K added for the Spring Semester, and another 80K for my fourth and final year. That's a total debt of at least 340K. The payment plan SM listed out for the highest interest loan I mentioned has a 126 month plan, of which 110 months are at $930/month. Residency for 3 years will likely be paying around 40K a year after taxes. If I pursue fellowship training after in order to boost my earning potential with a specialty of my choice, that's likely another 3-4 years at a max salary of maybe 55K. 

All told, when I graduate at 26, I am looking at at least 3 years of 40K-55K/year salary, in all likelihood 6-7 years. During that time, interest just keeps piling up. A year from now, the NEW interest on my loans will be just over 14K, and I won't even be halfway through my 4th year.

I've heard of people just paying down interest during residency, but that amounts to more than third of take-home pay, given my calculation earlier. Others have gone further, recommending making minimum payments during residency because it isn't worth an absolutely horrible life on a shoestring budget during residency just to stave off interest payments that amount to maybe 2-3 months max worth of salary as a full-fledged attending physician after training is all done. Assuming I go into a specialty of around 250K-300K a year, that's a biweekly paycheck of 9.5K-11.5K, so I think the math checks out here.

personalfinance,Math of interest and cash back,"My wife and I have a car loan with a balance of $6000 at 4.5% APR compounded monthly. I am trying to figure out what the effective rate is when you factor in 2% cash back rewards paying down the loan.

If I put $350 (in addition to the $354 autopayed from bank account) per month towards the loan at 2% cash back.

If I choose to pay it off over a long period of time using credit card rewards. What kind of rate would that be? This is very complicated for me to figure out, I wonder if you guys have any advice?

$250 (-$5 cash back) + $354 = $599 towards debt at 4.5% every month.

Right now we pay $22/month interest and get $5 back from cash back rewards.

I am trying to justify paying the loan down over time with $350 at 2% cash back from a credit card while putting the majority of my extra money into 401k. Trying to figure out what the effective %APR for the loan would be if I did this.

My theory is since we get $5 cash back/month and the interest is $22/month then 5/22 is 0.2272 . So the cash back makes the interest 22.72% cheaper. So 1 - 0.2272 = 0.7728. This means 4.5% * 0.7728 = 3.4776% is the effective interest rate of the loan. This APR should get even lower over time as the interest per month drops and the cash back stays the same.

The reason I can only get $250 every month from cash back with no fees is because I use American Express Serve. There are only $750 in bills that have credit card fees each month, so I have $250 to put towards bills or debt that negate credit card fees.

If i were to invest in stocks I would go pick Vanguards VTSAX/VFINX, VGTSX ; 
bonds: VTIBX, VBTLX

TL;DR Smartest way to invest for 5 to 7 years for a house?

personalfinance,"Just graduated and got my first job, but where should I put my money first?","To start with, I'm 24 years old and I know jack squat about personal finance. The only thing my parents said about money is ""We can't keep bleeding money like this!"" and ""Your dad maxed out the credit card again"". How much we could spend depended on my mom's mood that day.

I just graduated with an AS degree in computer networking. Nothing too special, but because I moved out of state to be closer to my long distance boyfriend, I had to pay out of state tuition. I also dropped out of a fancy (expensive..) cosmetology school when I realized my social anxiety wouldn't let me continue. Had to pay full tuition anyway. My parents are taking care of some of my debt, but I still have $23,868 on my end to pay for. If it helps, it's unsubsidized with 6.8% interest rate.

I also just got my first job making $17.53/hour and 40 hours a week. My boyfriend is unemployed and taking off from school due to health reasons. He was pursuing a music composition degree. He may start teaching piano lessons soon to try and help. We're also currently living with his mom, who only charges us the difference we created in the utilities and cable bill, so around $175/month. Great deal, and she's awesome.

Originally, I was planning on saving up for a car with nice gas mileage so we could save more on gas and so I could finally learn to drive. My boyfriend has a '99 4Runner and I'm too short to comfortably drive it, especially while still learning. We also want to move out of his mom's place sooner rather than later. Right now, I live 30 to 40 minutes from work and it's really adding up in gas.

**So my main question is:** Where should I be putting my money in order to get us on our feet the fastest? I started a savings account and started shoving in $400 every two weeks (every paycheck), with the idea of putting it towards a car, and then I pay only $25 over the minimum loan payment. Should I instead be putting everything I can towards my loans and just forget about the car for a bit?


**Important Points:**

* Income: $17.53/hour and 40 hrs/week
* Student Loan Debt: $23,868, 6.8% interest rate, currently paying $25 over minimum monthly payment of $275.14
* Current savings: $1,250, I put in $400 every two weeks plus any gift money I get
* I only pay $175 for where I'm living (no rent, just portion of utilities and comcast)
* Boyfriend's car is a gas hog and the drive to work is 30-40 minutes, want to get a car with better mileage and easier for a short person to learn to drive in
* Boyfriend has severe chronic pain condition that would make it difficult for him to work or go to school, but he's too embarrassed to consider things like disability or government aid
* Don't want to live with my boyfriend's mom forever and kind of want to have my first kid before I'm 30, but only if we're financially able of course",finance,1410395717

personalfinance,Student Loan Default and Private Loans?,"Hey /r/personalfinance , I've been a lurker for a while since I decided to get my finances in better order and now I'd like to ask you all a question/your opinions on my situation. 

I'm in my mid 20s and back in school looking to get a nursing degree. I went to school at 18 and had a federal loan for about $5,000. I didn't know what I wanted to do at 18, so I dropped out after a year. Of course, and I know I'm an idiot, I didn't have the money to repay that loan so it went into default. After about 6 months of default, I realized what an idiot I was being and started paying it back (payments at $50/month). It's worth noting that they never really came after me or tried to garnish my wages or anything like that.

I've been back in school now for about two years and I'm working towards a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, so my loan is deferred and I've added a couple of Direct Subsidized Loans ($1,750 per semester for four semesters). 

Now, my loan debt is at about $9,500. All Federal loans and all subsidized. I have one more semester before I can apply to nursing schools. The school I'm looking at right now (and most likely to get into) will cost me about $50,000 over two years and I'll end up with a Bachelor's. There are two other (cheaper) programs I can apply to where I will come out with about $20,000 in loans after the two years, but I will only have an Associate's (side note: it is **very** difficult to get a good nursing job with an associate's in Colorado) and frankly, they are much more competitive programs because they are state schools and much cheaper so = more competition (I'm not very confident that I will get into the less expensive option either). 

Now I know that $50,000 is loans is definitely a lot. I would be able to get a certain amount from the government in federal loans, but of course it won't cover that entire amount, so I would certainly need to take out some private loans. However, I'm not entirely confident that I would be able to get something like a private loan from Sallie Mae since I have the loan default on my record, even though it is now deferred. I do have a solid cosigner, but I'm really not sure if it's even possible that way.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I really want to do this the right way, but at the same I'm looking to get through school as quickly as I can so I can start contributing financially. (PS I'm in school full time with no job; my spouse has been gracious enough to help me while I'm in school)

Is there a loan option I don't know about besides Sallie Mae? Does anyone have any advice for me? I'm ready and willing to accept anything you say. I will definitely answer any questions in the comments if I missed something. Thank you so much for reading!",finance,1410395947

I have an extra $1500 a month to play around with after credit card payments, retirement accounts, bills etc.  

Should I try to get 20% equity in my current rental to free up the VA loan?  Should I save $1500x 24 = $36,000, which would probably only be a 10% down payment?  How are the interest rates between a new rental loan and a new home loan?",finance,1410400637
personalfinance,Won a lawsuit! ....and uhh....shit now what (hopefully doing things right as of now?),"So I won a lawsuit and will be netting about 36k.  I already have a Vanguard Roth-IRA targeted fund (2050) that is set to max out each year (currently at 10.2k).  I have about 27.5k in a high yield savings account (.85% whoopee!) which I was building up as an emergency fund but have since secured a job and felt confident enough to start doing stuff with it, this is prior to winning my lawsuit.  I have a rollover IRA with about $2200 in it that is more or less irrelevant and from a past job.   What I've started doing with my savings is investing in another index fund of Vanguards recommended to me, which is the Wellesley Income Fund (currently 4k invested in it and set to invest 500 weekly out of my savings account).   It should pay dividends on my money and should I need my money it seemed relatively safe but at least my money would be working for me.   Originally, I was just going to put the 27.5k in it but I've been told that I should probably just put about 10k into it but that leaves me with some extra cash and no idea what to do with it.

I know a home is an often suggested option but I am not in a position to buy right now (this area is stupid expensive).  I owe about 14k (300/month payments) on my car but my interest rate is only 2.25% so there’s little reason in my mind to invest my money in that.  I have about 11k in student loans, but they are all subsidized at a low 3.25% and I am still a student and will be for at least another year and a half (part time finishing bachelors) so no real reason in my mind to spend money on that when it isn’t costing me anything to have and my money can do more for me.  

I read about people here doing 3 way investments and I also am aware of admiral funds for vanguard but not sure it’s worth it to dump the majority of what I have into any given 1 fund for that small break.   I could really use your guys help and suggestions for how to handle this as I have tried to research and apply sound decisions but am a bit past my knowledge at this point.  Also forgot to mention I am currently 31 years old and work in IT.  I make about 47.5k and my current employer offers no retirement benefits what-so-ever so I am on my own, otherwise I know to at the very least do my 401k match. Lastly no credit card debt to speak of as I pay it off monthly. 

TL: DR – Won 36k and already had 27.5k to invest.  Current financial commitments are all very low interest.  Need guidance!

personalfinance,How to best allocate extra income?,"My wife and I have about $2,000/mo of extra income we'd like to use to help ourselves long term financially with.

There's a few areas I can see spending the money on. What do you think is the best route to take?

* We recently purchased a home with 5% down. The mortgage is 30-year fixed rate for $163k at 4.25%. We pay PMI, which accounts for $84 of the $1244/mo payment.
* My wife has $35k of student loans at 6.8%. The min payment is ~$500/mo.
* I have $50k of student loans at various rates averaging 5%. The min payment is also ~$500/mo.
* We have an emergency fund of $15k sitting in a savings account which we do not touch to pay regular bills.
* Credit cards are paid off in full each month.

So beyond the minimum payments, we have about $2k/mo extra we'd like to use to pay down some debt or perhaps invest if it makes more sense long term.

I was thinking of putting the full amount toward my wife's student loans first, since they have the highest interest rate, and once they are paid off, switch over to paying mine down.

However I had another idea to pay hers student loans down, and then work towards a 20% equity on the house, and then refi to a 15 year fixed loan, leaving us with no PMI and a much better interest rate. Even without the refi, getting rid of PMI would be nice.

Which scenario makes more financial sense? Or would it be even better to do some other plan?

technology,Representative Michael Burgess (R-TX) on Net Neutrality,"&gt; Thank you for contacting me regarding the Federal Communications Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the Internet. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.
 
&gt; As you may know, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was formed to regulate interstate and international communication by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in the United States. Recently, the FCC announced that they are seeking comments on a proposed rule attempting to constrain the internet and allow companies to pay more for faster internet.
 
&gt; The Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) would seek to reclassify internet broadband service as an **old-fashioned** ""Title II"" common carrier services. As such, the FCC would be able to regulate the internet as they would and telecommunications services rather than an information service, as it is right now. **The fact of the matter remains that the Internet has thrived for years because the government has not exercised strong regulatory control over it.** Broadband providers have been able to innovate and invest in new networks and services, improving the customer experience. **Imposing new *burdensome regulation* on these providers, there is less ability and less incentive to innovate, ultimately harming consumers. The *free market* and existing competition laws protect consumers better than the unnecessary rules made by the FCC.**
 
&gt; Currently, the only way for broadband providers to recoup their costs of building and maintaining these very expensive networks is to charge consumers. **These net neutrality rules will prevent the broadband consumers from being able to spread the cost around by also charging ""edge providers.""** These certain providers are using and benefiting and often profiting from the broadband networks.

personalfinance,"4 months after purchasing a car, I see another 2k added to current car balance.","I apologize if this has a better subreddit for car loans/credit unions, please feel free to redirect if needed.

**Background:** I bought a car from my dad a few months back. I sold my old car for 5k cash, paid 3k of it to pay off the old car, and put the rest as a down payment on the new car. I went through a credit union and got 2.74% interest rate over 5 years at $201.00 per month on an ~11k loan. I've been paying $250 a month to get it paid off a year early - four years instead of five. Today, I logged into my Credit Union account and noticed an addition 2k withdrawl added to my overall balance - 3 months after I made the purchase. I was never told anything like this when I took out the loan. I also have new full-coverage insurance that reflects this new vehicle.

 It's a **""Charge Assessment SNC CPI ADD 05/31/14-05/31/15""** if that helps.

Can anyone clarify what this charge might be? I'm going to stop into my bank regardless, but I'd like some knowledge on why I might be charged first before I walk in completely clueless.

Update 1: Thanks /r/personalfinance. I think all I need to do is provide my insurance to the lender. I'll leave the post up if anyone wants to reference it in the future.

Update 2: From my insurance company:

Bitcoin,"A good economy is like an orgasm, it's pretty hard to have one with a gun pointed at your head.","Deflation in our dollar happens when people who earn money by producing goods or services have no better place to put their ""capital"" (the profit from their enterprise) but into the repayment of debit rather than any other investment. 

Our fractional reserve system is set up so that a very small input, say a 1,000 dollar savings account, can ""create"" hundreds of thousands of dollars of ""capital"".  

The opposite happens when you pay off a debit.  When you borrow 1,000 dollars and buy a new computer for your office that money ends up in a bank, and that bank can then loan out 10,000 dollars due to the deposit.  But when you earn 1,000 dollars and instead of expanding and buying another computer, you instead pay off that debit you destroy capital.  The bank has to un-create that 10,000 dollars when you destroy the debit.   The impact is huge,  your not just taking 1,000 dollars out of the economy,  your taking out the foundation of perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars of loans.    

If your a bank, especially the central bank, and you have to unwind all that layered debit it gets real tricky real fast. 

So we know that deflation is a risk, I own a company and right now I pay more debit with profit than I do borrow more money, so I personally am creating some deflation.   I assume others are in the same boat.  Credit is hard to get, and the risk of taking capital to buy equipment that the economy may or may not support in it's use it a huge risk.  I would rather pay debit than buy equipment and hire people.    This is deflationary.  

I'm tiny, but if the world in general is presented with a situation where the most profitable thing it can do is shore up it's foundation by paying back debits rather than borrowing to expand you will see huge numbers in debit repayment, and those numbers are exponentially expanded in the fractional reserve system,  so paying back 1 million in debit could send a ripple of a billion through the banking sector.   

so if inflation makes Bitcoin look good, wouldn't deflation make Bitcoin prices sink,  and if so, would you consider the switch from 1200 dollar Bitcoin to 500 dollar Bitcoin a signal of deflationary pressure??????  (on the dollar, not bitcoin) 

Bitcoin was doing well through the inflationary periods of QE1, QE2, and QEinfinity.   Now that the monetary injection is in the system rather than expand we are paying debit,  The FED gave us some bullets, and we are shooting them right back at them.  

They want, or should I more clearly say ""they NEED"" us to expand our credit because our debit is the foundation of the whole system.   If we are in fact seeing some deflation then you should see some major moves by the powers that be in an effort to expand our debit.  Or have we already seen this and they are running out of control on that as well????   They tried to pump back up the housing market to get people to buy homes,  and now it's falling flat.   I think they have been fighting deflation the whole time, and that they are running out of controls and running out of ways to push the markets. 

The funny thing is that what they are running low on is the one thing that makes money money...........Faith.  

The FED is running low on faith, hence deflation.  

The more they panic the more we see them panic the more faith they loose.  

It's easy to double down when you have new inventions like the internet that promise a new world and Greenspan saying hes got it under control.  Those were the good old days when the FED had unlimited faith.   I doubled down on MSFT and won every time...............(all except that last one).   I bought a car, bought a bed, Bought a TV, maxed out my credit cards, but managed to buy a home, it doubled in value and I got a line of credit to pay off all my credit cards and maxed them out again.........................that was it man, the peak of FED faith.  

What we have now is the opposite............so is it Deflation??

The only weapons the FED has is interest rates, (those bullets are long gone) and money supply,  (firing full auto) 

other than that the fed has to use major capital controls,They will have to invent rules and regulations to try and force a good economy...........

but a good economy is like an orgasm......it's pretty tough to have one with a gun pointed at your head.",cryptocurrency,1410446801
personalfinance,Avalanche vs. Snowball for NewlyWed Couple?,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

So my wife and I got married a year ago and have been busily adjusting to dealing with having different outlooks on finances. I'm the saver and she's the spender. I work for a local law firm pulling in $40,000/year and she works for a Plasma Donation center at approx. $12/hour. Between the two of us were bringing in about $3600/month. Unfortunately we live in a large Midwest city where the cost of living is just terrible, which has made it difficult to put as much money away as we'd like.

We've been trying really hard though, cutting down on eating out, going to the bar, buying things we don't need etc, and it's starting to pay off. We've managed to put away almost $2000 in the last few months, with good reason to believe that'll be boosted up even further in a couple weeks.

So we want to work on putting extra money toward our outstanding debts, which are as follows:

$20,000 Student Loans. All accruing interest at 3-6% due to differences in Subsidized vs UnSubsidized.
$5,000 Credit Card Debt with Chase.
$1,300 Credit Card? Debt paying off furniture.

Technically I'm in the hole with my parents as well from college, but they're being generous and we're paying it back ""as best we can, when we can."" So the trick is with interest and minimum payments. Student Loans are at of course 3-6%, but the Chase card is interest free for approx. another year. Likewise the furniture amount is interest free as long as I have it paid off in a year.

So the avalanche approach suggests pushing money toward the Student Loans because they have the highest current interest rate. But if I do that, I'll end up eating much higher interest on the other debts when their promotional periods expire.

So my gut says to knock the furniture deal out completely and roll that payment ($130/month) into the Chase card. If we come up with the money to pay that card off in the next year or two, we can roll both payments into the student debt, basically doubling what we're paying now and avoiding as much interest as possible.

Obviously I've thought about this a lot, but I'd of course love to have input from the community if you guys think there's a better way to manage things. Thoughts?",finance,1410446816

personalfinance,Looking for a good rewards card for my small business,"I have a small business. I run about $5-6k per month on a credit card. It's paid off for six months out of the year and carries a balance for about six months, depending on cash flow. I presently have an American Airlines card. The upside is that it does not appear on my personal credit report. The downside is that I'm limited to miles with one carrier.

I'm thinking about getting a new card, perhaps with cash back. I'd prefer an interest rate &gt;10%, if possible, and no caps on rewards. (Some months can see charges in the $10k range). Purchases are for business expenses (travel, gas, office supplies and medical).

I also need something that plays well with Quickbooks.

* ~ 14K in federal subsidized and unsubsidized ( 3% - 6 % I believe )

* ~ 50K I will owe my mother who took out an home equity line of credit to help me ( I think a 6% IR).

* Consulting with a smaller but quickly growing firm in Bimingham: 55K salary

I haven't decided between the jobs/cities yet, though I know that I would be able to live at home for a few years and pay almost nothing for rent/utilities if I take the lesser paying job. (also gas expenses will be significantly lessened because fuck atlanta driving).  I am seriously leaning towards this job, despite making 7k less a year.  I believe it will advance my career faster (This is almost inevitably the case), and I believe it is also the best plan for knocking these loans out before I'm too old (but tell me if I'm wrong!!!!).

I was a wild dude when I was younger, and very irresponsible. I recently have decided to go to school, and get a degree in finance. I am a little over a year into it. I basically have dug myself a bad place as far as credit is concerned, and I want to build capital. I am going to take a loan out for 10,000 dollars at a 4.99% interest rate 5 year loan (have not negotiated yet, it could go lower, and I will have a cosigner), and put the money in PSEC; a mid risk fund. this offers a 12.87% return on dividends (monthly) and would use this payout to hedge the cost of repayment. (I understand the risk). I will then offer 1 or 2 other family members an investment opportunity to get me either $5000 or $10000 to hedge payments even further, and offer them a compound interest of 8% at the investments end. Here is where I need the advice, do I take the $10000 and make the $20,000 investment in PSEC, or do I cut the payments down by paying off the loan with $5000, in each scenario the loan gets paid down with the dividends, however the higher risk scenario covers taxes as well, and gets a higer rate of return for both parties. 

my payments will be $188 with the $10,000, and $20,000 will make me $214 a month towards it

My net would be anywhere from 0 to $8000

with the $5000 idea, my payments will be $95, while the $10000 investment will make $107 payments towards it. 

0 dollars net after 5 years would be okay because it would build my credit, and if I end up owing, it won't destroy me.

Why were FBI investigations prior to 9/11 called off?

How could anyone NOT step up airport security in the face of so many warnings and SO MUCH intel?

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html 

And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed. Operatives connected to Bin Laden, one reported on June 29, expected the planned near-term attacks to have “dramatic consequences,” including major casualties. On July 1, the brief stated that the operation had been delayed, but “will occur soon.” Some of the briefs again reminded Mr. Bush that the attack timing was flexible, and that, despite any perceived delay, the planned assault was on track. 

Yet, the White House failed to take significant action. Officials at the Counterterrorism Center of the C.I.A. grew apoplectic. On July 9, at a meeting of the counterterrorism group, one official suggested that the staff put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place, two people who were there told me in interviews. The suggestion was batted down, they said, because there would be no time to train anyone else. 

2. Buildings do not collapse at free fall speed of their own accord 

The twin towers collapsed at free fall speed (as near as makes no difference).
This is evidenced by detailed video footage and seismic data.
Buildings cannot collapse at free fall speed without some kind of controlled demolition.

Why was the fact that the buildings collapsed at free fall speed excluded from the contents of the 9/11 commission report?

How were the controlled demolition charges placed on the steel beams in the twin towers?
We know there was ""maintenance"" work in the weeks prior to 9/11 which allowed access to the steel beams.

Who set off the charges for the controlled demolition?

Building 7 was ordered to be pulled down by Rudy Giuliani.
This building also fell at free fall speed from a controlled demolition.
The controlled demolition charges were in place before 9/11 (there was not enough time to place them in the building on 9/11 itself).

The BBC reported on Live TV, that Building 7 had collapsed while the building was still standing (you can see building 7 still standing behind the reporter).
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s
How did the BBC know that building 7 was going to be pulled before it happened?

We know that there were explosions immediately prior to the buildings collapse; and several injuries from those explosions; in the basements of the twin towers.
Why was this evidence not included in the 9/11 commission report?
Why were the eye witnesses to these explosions not called to testify?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhGcBxONSvc

3. Why were the steel beams from the twin towers smuggled out of the country within 2 weeks of 911? 

Never before in history has a skyscraper collapsed just from fire.
The buildings were designed to withstand the impact from up to 6 aircraft simultaneously, only 1 aircraft hit each tower.
Jet fuel only burns at about 700 degrees C.
Temperatures of 1200 degrees C are required to weaken steel.

You would of thought that the American government would be anxious to know why the buildings collapsed when they had been designed to withstand the impact from multiple aircraft.
Why were samples of the steel beams not sent to every major research facility, of major universities, in the US to understand what had gone wrong and to prevent such a disaster from ever happening again?

Why were the steel beams smuggled out of the country very quickly to prevent this from being done?

4. 7 out of 10 of the 9/11 commissioners now disagree with the contents of the official 9/11 report. 

The report's author is particularly scathing

The Attorney General (John Farmer) who drafted the 9/11 report for the 9/11 commission now says that the report is based on government lies and is almost entirely untrue.


(CINCINNATI, Ohio) - In John Farmer’s book: “The Ground Truth: The Story Behind America’s Defense on 9/11″, the author builds the inescapably convincing case that the official version... is almost entirely untrue...
The 9/11 Commission now tells us that the official version of 9/11 was based on false testimony and documents and is almost entirely untrue. The details of this massive cover-up are carefully outlined in a book by John Farmer, who was the Senior Counsel for the 9/11 Commission.
Farmer, Dean of Rutger Universities' School of Law and former Attorney General of New Jersey, was responsible for drafting the original flawed 9/11 report.
Does Farmer have cooperation and agreement from other members of the Commission? Yes. Did they say Bush ordered 9/11? No. Do they say that the 9/11 Commission was lied to by the FBI, CIA, Whitehouse and NORAD? Yes. Is there full documentary proof of this? Yes.
Farmer states...“at some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened... I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The [Norad air defense] tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years. This is not spin.”

5. The 270 degree turn and rapid descent of the aircraft that hit the Pentagon. 

Experienced pilots have testified that they could not of made such a manoevre.
How could a very inexperienced pilot with only very limited flight training have accomplished it?

The official account of the attack on the Pentagon has many flaws, the above is just one of them.
The attack on the Pentagon needs to be re-investigated.

6. Condoleezza Rice's statement that no one could of expected terrorists to hijack aircraft and use them as weapons is an obvious and blatant lie 

See 1 above of the numerous foreign intelligence and diplomatic warnings that this was exactly what was being planned and the American government knew it, prior to 9/11.

The debris from Flight 93 indicates a mid air explosion - not a crash landing.
The debris is scattered over too wide an area for a crash landing.

Flight 93 was the plane where the passengers attempted to over power the hijackers.
Was Flight 93 intercepted and shot down?
Flight 93 was in the air after the other planes had crashed.

Flight 93 needs further investigation.

8. Saudi Royal Family and Saudi government involvement in 9/11

Inside the Saudi 9/11 coverup

After the 9/11 attacks, the public was told al Qaeda acted alone, with no state sponsors.
But the White House never let it see an entire section of Congress’ investigative report on 9/11 dealing with “specific sources of foreign support” for the 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi nationals.
It was kept secret and remains so today.
President Bush inexplicably censored 28 full pages of the 800-page report. Text isn’t just blacked-out here and there in this critical-yet-missing middle section. The pages are completely blank, except for dotted lines where an estimated 7,200 words once stood (this story by comparison is about 1,000 words).
A pair of lawmakers who recently read the redacted portion say they are “absolutely shocked” at the level of foreign state involvement in the attacks.
Reps. Walter Jones (R-NC) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) can’t reveal the nation identified by it without violating federal law. So they’ve proposed Congress pass a resolution asking President Obama to declassify the entire 2002 report, “Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.”

Saudi-Sized Cracks in the 9/11 Wall of Silence

Two Congressmen, a Democrat and a Republican, are asking Obama to declassify the congressional report on 9/11, which the Bush administration heavily redacted.
The two members of the House of Representatives have read the blacked-out portions, including 28 totally blank pages that deal largely with Saudi government ties to the alleged 9/11 hijackers.
This is apparently major connect-the-dots stuff—much more significant than what one may remember from Michael Moore’s film Fahrenheit 911, about Saudi royals and other Saudis studying and living in the US, who were allowed to go home without being interviewed in the aftermath of the attacks. This is about actual financial and logistical support of terrorism against the United States—by its ally, the Saudi government.
As a Hoover Institution media scholar wrote in the New York Post (normally no bastion of deep investigative inquiry):
The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found “incontrovertible evidence” that Saudi government officials — not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers employed by the kingdom — helped the hijackers both financially and logistically. The intelligence files cited in the report directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war.
Congressmen “absolutely shocked”
The two outspoken Representatives, Walter Jones (R-NC) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass) would be violating federal law if they offered any specifics about what they know, or even named any countries mentioned—but did say they were  “absolutely shocked” by revelations of foreign state involvement in the attacks. Now, they want a resolution requesting Obama declassify the entire document.
If the media were to do its job and create the kind of wall-to-wall coverage it bestows upon, say, inter-spousal murder trials, Obama might feel he had to release the full 9/11 report. He’d have to concede there is a public right to know, or at least explain in detail why he doesn’t think so. Either way, there would be major fireworks. But we’re not betting on either the president or the media doing the right thing.

solar,"Solar Tax Credits, NY State","There is a government incentive program from NYSERDA, a New York organization, that gives contractors a rebate that they are supposed to fully apply to their cost of setting up your system. Of course, that just means you cannot do it yourself and the contractors just raise their installation cost to make it look good. Currently, around $3.55 per watt.

There is also a Federal Tax credit. Now, this only seems to work if you have a Federal Tax Liability, which for the 42% of us that Romey calls suckers it doesn't seem that it can apply. Right now, I'm in entrepreneurial mode, and that reads, I'm spending my savings investing in my gig. My questions are:

Can I carry over get the Federal Tax Credit over onto the following years, or does it disappear like my deductions for my self-employed health insurance? (i.e. deducting it from zero is zero).

Can I get the Fed Tax Credit if I install the damn thing myself? Of course, I need a licensed electrician to pull the permit. But I can buy these things cheaper and do the work myself.

On a related note, there is a ""Solarize ....."" program in town that has selected a single installer and they say they are lowering costs by making it a bulk purchase. So they say they've brought the cost down from $3.55/Watt to $3.22/Watt. However, I have a friend in CO who says, it should cost about $2.25/Watt.

personalfinance,"Starting a new job Monday in 4 years, want some advice","So, I've been looking for a job for almost 4 years now (October would've been that mark), but landed one this month and I start Monday.  I'm excited.

After about 3 months I get to do a 401k (first time ever having that option).

Now, my past is pretty bad.  I was essentially living paycheck-by-paycheck even though I was making sustainable money.  It was just that I made poor financial decisions like getting an apartment after the 1rst month of employment.

Over the past year I've started rebuilding my credit, and now that I have this job I'm wanting to make better decisions.  One of these is going to be doing the 401k so I don't have to (hopefully) work til I'm dead.

I have 3 debt collections and a student loan, and I'm going to be paying off the debts right away (some are 1-2 paychecks doable).

My goal for 5 years is to:

* Own a house (looking in the $70-100k range which is doable for where I'm looking)
* Own a better car (preferably buy outright unless I can get my credit better to lease/finance)

From there everything pretty much falls into its own place.  I do plan on doing that car thing though sooner (after my 3-month period or little sooner).

Basically why I'm posting here though is I would like advice on how to make this happen.  I've signed up for Mint and don't have a lot of expenses to worry about (my wife works too so she's helped a lot).  I've got 2 savings accounts (1 joint &amp; 1 personal) along with a checking account.  Due to poor habits in the past I've heavily decided to claim 0 for dependents on my W-4, but not sure if I should or not (debating 0 or 1, haven't filled that in yet).

I plan on saving ~30% of each check as a rainy day fund so to speak, as about 50% of it is going towards bills, gas, food and the other 20% for leasure activities.

I've gandered through the FAQ but this is kind of everywhere at the moment.  I haven't started the job yet so I don't know how I can really budget with an unknown amount of $ on checks (I can only guesstimate so I factored 20% total out for state &amp; federal taxes).  I've got some safeguards in place (Mint), but...  I'd like to know more on what I can do.",finance,1410478888

The government ended up garnishing my wages, and as far as I know that satisfied the debt back in 2007.

Now, I'm in the process of buying a first property for my family via an FHA-insured mortgage. Even though I paid off that loan in 2007, I went ahead and checked the federal student loan database anyway, just to make sure I'm all clear. Lo and behold, there's an old Perkins loan listed as in still in default that I suppose was not taken care of by the garnishment. 

I checked with the DOE, but I was told because it's a Perkins loan to contact the university, who then told me it's in collections and which agency to contact. I contacted that collections agency, and they told me the account was closed in 2009, but they would check back with my old college. They have not gotten back to me. I have no idea if the debt is actually paid (doubtful) or still out there (probable).

FHA loans cannot go through with any defaulted federal debt, and I'm 99% sure this will show up in CAIVRS since it's on the government's student loan website. I don't want to lose my chance at this property, but I also don't have enough money for the property and paying off the defaulted loan. At this point, I think the best option is take out a personal loan, pay off the debt (it's about $8,000 now) so it's not longer in default, and hope for the best when it comes to qualifying for the mortgage. Anyone have any insight or gone through something similar? And thanks for your time.

personalfinance,Need advice re: student loan consolidation,"Hello personalfinance!

I'm looking for a little advice about where to go next. I've graduated school with a ton of debt. Both federal and private loans. I'm on income based repayment for my federal loans, which monthly payment is zero right now due to income. My private loans are from various companies, 3 from Salle Mae, one from Wells Fargo and one at American Education Services (it was sold to them). 

I am currently in repayment on all of them, and my monthly payments with my monthly paycheck are leaving me with nothing to save. I am truly living paycheck to paycheck and if there is an emergency I would be out of luck. I have about 1,000 in savings right now.

I was hoping to consolidate my private loans together, as the Salle Mae ones have 7-10% interest rates (depending on the loan), and get a smaller monthly payment. I know I will likely be paying loans back for the rest of my life, so extending the repayment time isn't really an issue for me. 

I applied for a consolidation loan through Wells Fargo and was told I would need a cosigner. This effectively denied me as I have literally no one I could ask to cosign with me. 

I'm wondering, are there other options for consolidation of private loans? I was thinking of going to a credit counseling agency to see if they may be able to better convince a bank to consolidate? I am trying to be proactive, I have never defaulted on a loan, and I don't want to now. My credit score is high, but, as you can imagine, my debt to income ratio is through the roof. I can't get any sort of credit card, which is fine. I have one for emergencies I got before my loans. But no one will finance me in anything, not even a consolidation loan. I was hoping consolidation would help me actually improve the debt to income ratio, at least make the difference between my initial principal and the amount I owe look better (another reason the bank said they wouldn't consolidate).

Bitcoin,Net Neutrality- A Short (American) History,"What, exactly, is net neutrality? ….”the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.”

The Federal Communications Commission has been acting on net neutrality for quite some time now. In 2010, the FCC issued its Open Internet Order, where Internet service providers were now prohibited from blocking content and prioritizing certain kinds of traffic. Ont he consumer side, these rules looked like they were too weak (they did not cover mobile web providers), but on the telecommunications established companies side it looked like the Open Internet Orders new regulations were too strong (they would have preferred more wiggle room.) 

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are classified as “Information Services. Law states that no discrimination/price regulations are necessary for “consumer protection.” Essentially, what this means is that the FCC hasn’t the authority to regulate ISPs. On the flip side, however, the FCC does have the authority to regulate inter-state and international communications. 

After a considerable amount of back-and forth between Verizon, the FCC and the DC Court of Appeals, the judicial system agreed with Verizon- the Commission did not, in fact, have the authority to implement regulations that would limit ISPs (like Verizon) in their ability to block/discriminate against websites. Reason: unless the Internet is reclassified as a public utility, the FCC has no jurisdiction. 

However, the DC Court of Appeals did say that the FCC has some ounce of authority to establish net neutrality rules as long as it promotes broadband deployment all across the nation. 

That tiny bit of leeway was all the FCC needed to bring forth this new proposal. It’s open for comment to the public, until Tuesday September 15th, 2014. 

This blog entry is the first on a short series on net neutrality and how it affects businesses, consumers and society at all levels. It will be an impartial series, stating fact and not bringing opinions to the table. As a blogger for a company, I will remain objective and leave the debates up to the audience!

Note that my wife and I are in a strange situation right now as I am in the middle of an expat assignment in Montreal so my company is paying for our rent until June 2015. Also my wife is a teacher, but because she doesn’t speak French and her credentials did not transfer, she is currently unable to work.

 Here’s where my wife and I are at right now:  
**Status**  

* 25M and 26F  

* Emergency Fund- $15k ~ 6 months of expenses  

* Student Loan Debt - $0 (paid off last month)  

* Car Loan - $11,392.55 @ 2.45% --&gt; 48 months left --&gt; min payment $248/month  

* CC Debt - $0 (paid in full every month)  

* 401K - $17,143.29 --&gt;12% monthly contribution from me + 4% employer match  --&gt; Fidelity Target 2055 ER @ 0.09%  

* Other Savings - $3,105.92  
  
* Operating Income (Checking Account) - $2,428.38 (I get paid Monday we re-balance this to $3K at the end of each month, but took a big hit last month due to paying off student loans.)   


**Expenses (some in CAD some in USD. Not a huge difference but…)**  

* Car Payment - $250/month USD  

* Phone ~ $70/month USD  

* Groceries - $460/ month CAD (we like fresh produce and everything is expensive here.)    

* Restaurants- $200/ month CAD (that's eating out once a week here)  

* Entertainment - $200/ month CAD (we have yet to spend this much, but we allow ourselves each $100/ month if we want to buy things like – a new hair dryer, a new Safety Razor, a video game, books, a new album--&gt; anything that would be considered a personal purchase).    

* Alcohol - $100/ month CAD (alcohol is extremely expensive here. A bottle of wine that cost us less than $10 in California can easily be over $20 here. We like wine, so we indulge ourselves with a bottle of some sort of alcohol once a week on the weekends.)    

* Gas - $240/ month CAD  

* Car Insurance - $100/month USD (We have our cars on a storage plan in the states. We will get reimbursed 70% of this money once we return to the states).  

* Renter's Insurance - $50/month CAD (don't have a policy yet, but conservative estimate).     

* Netflix/Hulu - $20/ month USD  

 **Total- $1690/ month (mixed USD &amp; CAD)**  

**Income (all USD)**    

* Base Salary Gross- $5,125/ month  
* Net (after 12% to 401K + Tax + Medical) - $3,359/ month  
* Quarterly Bonus ~ 11.5% approx Net $4,777/ year

At this point many of you will notice the gap between income and spending. This is a good problem to have, but we don’t know what to do with it! This is where I need help. Maybe I read the “I have $[X]” post incorrectly, but it seems on that post it recommends “ SAVING AS MUCH AS YOUR BUDGET ALOWS” for retirement before contributing to any non-retirement goal. This is where I get myself all confused. Steps 4- 5b seem subjective and I need help sorting them out.   

So the bottom line is that I’ve calculated we can bank approximately $18,000 from now until June 2015. This is an estimate based on the fact that I know we will need to buy some things to survive winter here, and I know we want to explore this country while we live here. Given the above information do we use that money to:   

[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  


A)Pay off the car loan and save some for a future down payment on a house. (Even though the car loan is at a low interest rate)  

B)Save all of it for a future down payment on a house and buy a house sooner. 

C)Something else involving retirement contributions.  


[](/spacer)  
[](/spacer)  


I really would prefer A or B. I am still contributing 16% (total) to my 401K during this time period. That will not change. In the meantime, I’d like to be able to focus on some short-to-mid-term goals. Like buying a house, starting a family, getting completely debt free, saving up to pay for a future family car in cash.  I feel like I can do some of these with $18K, but obviously not all of them.   
Is this a stupid time to be thinking about short-to-mid-term goals? I just feel like this expat assignment has given us a good opportunity and I do not want to squander it.

**Option D) An interesting proposition**  
Another thing to consider is that my in-laws have recently offered to buy my wife’s car from us for more than we’d get selling to a private party. They’d be giving it to my BIL who just started college. It is a 2007 Honda Accord. It’s decent condition, but it has nearly 200K miles on it, and we are planning to start a family in the near future. I want to have a car that is safe enough and large enough to accommodate a family. The Accord is worth about $6k. I think my in-laws may give us slightly more than that. We could sell the car and save the $18K + $6k to try and get something like a new-ish (1-3 year old) Honda CR-V. I think they go for around $18k-$20k depending on the miles and whatnot. The problem is we’d still owe some on my car, and we’d have nothing saved for a down payment on a house, but we’d have two new safe (almost fully paid off) cars to start a family. We could be debt free within 18 months (from now) and THEN start hardcore saving for a house. I’m just not sure what to do… I go back and forth between thinking option A, B, and D are the answer. Maybe none of them are. I honestly don’t know. That’s why I need your help.

 **Bonus Retirement Allocation Question**  

Given that the Fidelity Target Fund offered through my company has such a low Expense Ratio my current plan is to continue to increase the % contribution until I max out my 401K and THEN start contributing to a Roth IRA. Other than tax diversification I see no reason to start contributing to a Roth IRA yet, but I am not fully knowledgeable so what do you guys think? Is that a solid plan, or should I cut back my 401K contribution and start trying to max out a Roth IRA?

Retirement, Mid-Term Goals, getting debt free, or sell wife’s car to in-laws for more than we’d get private sell and buy a new family car outright? 2) Max out 401K with low ER or cut back 401K contributions and start Roth IRA?**",finance,1410533495

personalfinance,First year medical student completely lost in the world of finances.,"Hey guys and gals. I'm going to be real honest here: I've never really had a financial plan before, and I'm having a hard time trying to create one now; I feel a little ignorant about long term budgeting.
So my situation: I'm a first year medical student, and i'm 23 years old. Tuition is about 40k a year (craziness, right!?) I took out an extra 10k for living expenses this. So I'm taking out 40k a year at a 6.2% interest rate, and the 10k is at 7.2% (both are federal loans); the interest compounds on a yearly basis. Hopefully tuition won't increase too much over the next four years.

I've signed on with the national guard. They pay me a stipend of 2.2k a month with and additional ~500 bucks a month from drill. Once i graduate they'll pay up to 240k in loan repayment, but it's in 40k a year increments and it'll get taxed as it counts as income. I currently have about 14k in my checkings account and a little 100 dollars savings account that was mandatory for the student account..


Bills:

* Rent: 450
* Power: 70
* Internet: 60
* Car: 150 (I owe 7k at a 2% interest rate on a 2012 mazda 6)
* Car Insurance: 80
* Cell phone: 80

* Undergrad debt: 40 bucks a month; (incoming tangent) this is from a miscommunication between financial aid and the business office which led the business office into thinking they owed me 4k, but ended up telling me when i went to get the check that I owe them 4k instead-- not cool. I told them there was no way I could pay for that upfront-- i mean, they did just change my summer budget by 8k-- and told them i'd pay them 40 bucks a month for the next 100 months. 

So, here's what I'm trying to figure out: I have nothing like an ira or investments, well actually i have a few bitcoins that i bought for giggles a while back. I don't know whether I should start paying on my loans with my stipend each month, or put a portion towards a roth-IRA. I don't want to waste any of 240k loan repayment, but it's hard to figure out what tax bracket i'll be at during residency/first few years practicing. I will continue to receive my stipend throughout residency, so I should be a decent financial position after I graduate medical school. I'm not sure what i'd like to specialize in, but I'm strongly leaning towards emergency medicine or surgery. The ~160 grand worth of loans is pretty intimidating, and I'm just kind of at a loss at what I should be doing. Any advice/insight would be extremely appreciated.

Thanks!",finance,1410534520

personalfinance,Would like Mastercard or Visa credit card recommendation for a simple second card that will be used sparingly.,"I opened my Discover card 8 years ago and absolutely love it. No complaints. I would like to open another to help my credit and to use in the rare occurrences where a merchant doesn't accept Discover.  
  
I'm looking for a card that:  
* is Mastercard or Visa  
* has automatic bill pay so that each month it will pay off the full balance so that all I need to do is use it to pay for things and forget about the rest  
* has an easy to navigate website (preferably with live chat/instant messaging)  
* SIMPLE. I like my Discover card, because Discover is/was pretty much just a credit card company not linked to any other financial institution. When I log into my Discover card account, I only see information regarding and relevant to my Discover credit card. No complicated rewards program (points, miles, hotel stays) that I don't care about, just a simple cash back program with a few caveats.  
  
What I want to avoid is what happened two years ago when I wanted to do the same thing. I signed up for the PayPal Mastercard and it has been nothing but a pain. PayPal was a simple intuitive well polished service so I thought I'd get their credit card and get the benefits associated with PayPal. It sort of integrated my PayPal account with the credit card making the whole thing a bit convoluted, with the credit card integration their website was/is difficult to navigate or find answers to basic questions, shortly after you get your bearing on the website they completely revamp it, lacking customer service for their credit card, and worst of all NO AUTO PAY. I use it rarely, so if I make one $5 purchase and I forget to log on to manually pay the bill I get slapped with a big ol' late fee. Overall it seemed like they conducted PayPal very well and their credit card was less than an after thought that they just decided to pursue because it would make them additional money, but didn't put any effort into making the service any good.  
  
Interest rates, balance transfers, rewards, ect don't really matter for the new card I'd like to open. I just want a card that I can open and use sparingly for years and years. Not complicated and doesn't really require my involvement. If anyone knows of a card that meets this criteria I'd really appreciate the help. Thanks everyone! I love this sub.",finance,1410535790

personalfinance,I just found out I'm being audited. The state where I lived for a few months 5 years ago wants to charge me taxes against money I made months after moving. Does that seem right?,"I looked for tax subs and couldn't find anything with more than 2 or 3 people logged in. Please feel free to redirect and/or flame if this isn't the right spot, but I see a lot of tax questions come up on here, and you guys all seem really smart on this stuff.

So, I lived in State A for 4 months in 2009 on a temporary basis (internship) and only earned $1k while there. I moved back home to State B, waited 6 months for my job to start in State C, then moved and started earning decent money.

When I filed my state return (filed as non-resident/part year resident), it kept showing I owed taxes against the State C earnings. I spent hours and hours researching the tax laws of the state and even contacted the office. Everything suggested that I should not have to pay taxes on income earned after moving. Still, I couldn't get the tax form to agree.

The calculations went like this: Federal AGI * State A tax rate * (State A income / State C income) = tax liability.

It sounds fair, but it still means that I'm being taxed more than if I hadn't earned in State C. Example: AGI of $100k * state rate of 10% * ($1k state A / $99k state C) = $100. However, if I fill out the State A form with only my $1k State A income, I come out with a nice refund.

Finally, I found a line on the form called something like ""fair adjustment."" I looked up the statutes on this item, and it said it was to prevent anyone from being taxed twice on the same income. I thought ""well, State A and State C are both taxing me on this, this must be the answer."" I entered the amount I was being taxed, and it canceled out to equal zero. No refund, as it would if I had filed with only my State A income listed, but better than paying something.

Well, now I get a letter saying I'm being audited because the fair adjustment line can't be used for this. I contacted the auditor, and they said ""even though State C income is increasing your State A taxes, you're still not being taxed against State C income. You owe us money.""

Does this make sense?",finance,1410536317

1. I currently contributing about 6% of my pay to TSP (1% more than what my employer matches) Should I contribute less to use for paying of debt faster?

2. Any extra cash we get from holiday or differential pay should that still go to the lowest debt or should I pay off a larger one first (like my lower auto) to have more money to snowball into payments quicker. If I pay off all our lower bills first it only gives us just over a $100 but if I pay off my car it gives us $338 extra a month.

3. I have over 20 years left till retirement should I be in the roth or traditional tsp?

personalfinance,What would you do in this situation?,"Lets hypothetically say someone has an income (after taxes) of $70 000 yearly, student loan of $7000 whichs interest rate is 2% or something that small. No other debts.

A car worth $21 000. Outgoing flows of cash, for rent, food, transportation, hobbies, entertainment, averages around $15 000 for past 3 years.

So around 55k can go to savings per year easily. 

The real estate prices in this country are in my opinion in a bubble, it would cost upwards of $320 000 to buy a house far away from center or flat in center. The interest rate on a mortgage would be around 3-5%.

What would you do to minimize the time spent in the work-force, and become financially independent? To retire as soon as possible, with some sort of low income (its enough with 1k per month) from some form of savings.

What would be a good investment to achieve independence when you can save 55k, and are comfortable on around 1k per month?",finance,1410546726

personalfinance,First-year college student questions,"I just started college about a month ago, and originally my plan was to take out $3500 in Federal Subsidized Loans, and take out no other loans at all.  I had about a $2000 difference that I expected my father would be able to pay out of pocket, but a couple weeks into school he calls and tells me that he can't support me at all in terms of actually paying directly for school, so I had to take out $2000 in Federal Unsubsidized Loans.  So theoretically now I will be taking out $5500 dollars per year of school, plus if my understanding of how the unsubsidized loan works, this loan is already building up interest.  Taking out this amount of loans is really uncomfortable for me, as I plan on doing something in the public teaching field (though I am not completely sure of this), and don't expect to make a very high salary.  I've looked at what I'm paying for through my school trying to figure out ways to cut back my expenses.  I am paying nearly $5000 dollars a year for my room, and a little over $3000 for my meal plan.  With the workload I have I don't think that I have the ability to have a job while going to school full time.

personalfinance,"Can't afford college for my kids, even after saving for over 10 years. WTF","We tried to save some money for our two kids for school.  Now that it's time to actually start paying, I am fuming.  I am posting my story so that other parents can learn from it.

Here's our story: When our kids were 3 and 5 years old we started putting away $100/month per kid into accounts for each of them.  This was the first time we got our head above water financially and had the money to spare.  3 years ago we realized how close college was coming so we bumped it up to $200 each per kid.  My wife and I both work but combined we make about 95k before tax.  We are solidly middle class but we still budget and after saving for retirement there just isn't much left for anything extravagant.  

My kid did well in school (3.7 GPA), but did not qualify for any scholarships.  And guess what, because we earn ""so much"" our kid gets no fucking aid except for unsubsidized loans that will end up having terrible interest rates.

So how did this whole ""saving"" plan work out for us?  Well, the oldest only has $23k total saved.  They are going to a public university but the cost is still about $22k a year.  IF the fucking price stays the same then we are short $65k - even though we started saving relatively early.  So the choice was do we pay about $1350/month for the oldest kid to go to school or take on loans?  The loans won and now when my kid, who we worked hard for, and who worked hard to get into school will end up with $65k in debt when he graduates.  And we had to cosign so that debt might end up back with us.

I honestly feel like the amount of money we saved (which was a hardship for us some months) was just a drop in the bucket.  To have my son start his adult life with that much debt in this economy makes me wonder what the hell happened.",finance,1410565513

His work is offering a program where they work in conjunction with Sofi (a student loan company). His work will give $500 dollars in cash if you switch your student loan over to them. The interest rate will be a fixed  4.5 percent for 10 years.

Our question is this: Should we switch over to them? The interest rate is better, but we'd be starting a 10 year cycle again but we'd also get some cash that we could put toward the loans. Also, should we consolidate our loans? We are paying things just fine but I wouldn't mind saving money and putting it toward a rainy day fund or investing it. I'd like to pay the least amount in interest.",finance,1410589830

Current situation is: 

1. Make 40-45k

2. 23 years old


3. Parents have been taking care of loan payments for school. Started at 30k and is now down to 16-18k last I looked. However they have sent $1000 payments each time and they apply it pro-rata across the loans with varying rates of interest (not good for me). 


I reached out to FedLoan Services and they said if I paid my monthly requirements, I can then distribute extra payments towards certain loans (to knock off the ones with higher interest) provided I do it online. 

My question is, I don't make much at the moment, probably 40-45k. Company does 5% matching but I've been liberally dumping my paycheck into it because LOLnoexpenses (get a net of $120 after 60% Roth deferral and standard withholdings). I'm going to wind that back so I end up getting a net of $1500 with 30% deferral so I get cash flow and liquidity. 

My whole logic was paying off debt between 3.4-6.8% interest will most likely beat out mutual funds that I have invested (401k or Vanguard IRA) at best 3-6% (in the boring S&amp;P 500, VTSAX and VTIAX. I am aware these indexes over a more prolonged period of time yield something more like 7-8%). 

I was telling a friend of mine (really financially well off...maybe he's thinking outside the box or just has these high quality problems himself) my situation and he actually gave me a pretty unique insight. He said if my parents don't mind paying for my expenses that I should just put more money into retirement accounts, potentially taxable if available and build a large base so many can compound more meaningfully. The thing that was more important is that I would side step inheritance tax (parents' net worth not high to an extent if they were to take care of my debt obligations.


**TLDR**

-Parents don't mind paying off my student debt loans as well as my expenses in general

-Should I sidestep inheritance tax and just have them pay while I accrue a decent base for my retirement accounts? Or would paying off this debt with guaranteed interest accruals be better?",finance,1410593120

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 248 - Rebuilding the Revolution,"Hey all! GoodShibe here!

It's a fun thing to see the positivity growing around the sub, to watch our valuation grow as the future for Dogecoin begins to look much, much brighter.  The confidence in our coin is also growing and, I suspect, this is the start of a fantastic second wind for DOGE.

Those of us who bought in large at 22 Satoshis, when we were near our bottom, are being heavily rewarded right now as we've already more than doubled our investment.  Those buying in at around the 50 mark, well, let's just say that I remember the last time this happened, where folks grudgingly bought in at 50 and were more than happy when people were complaining about buying in at 90.

I'm definitely not saying that you should throw your life savings into DOGE, again, as always, never invest more than you're willing to lose.  Cryptocurrencies are stupidly volatile at times and no one has enough real data to start building solid trends.  (Though I still stand by my crypto-winter analysis and think that this winter is going to be the equivalent of crypto-summer... guess we'll find out soon enough).

The great thing about all of this is that because we never gave up on DOGE, kept irons in the fire, kept building, kept on trying to make this place *fun* if nothing else... I feel like we've actually put ourselves into a great position for long term growth.

Because, though it may not seem like it, we're adding something to the world here.

You, me, all of us, our positivity, our kindness, our camaraderie -- our flat-out refusal to be silenced, to go quietly into the night.

That has value.  

Dogecoin matters, is relevant, is in demand... because you never quit. Despite the trolls and the naysayers and those who worked hard to spread Fear and Uncertainty and Doubt.  

You held on.  *You made us matter*.

I don't know where the ceiling is for us at the moment, but I suspect it's much, much higher than right now.  And I suspect that there are going to be a lot of people kicking themselves for selling their holdings when it was low.

Are we back up to 200-300 satoshis?  Are we worth a penny each?  No.  

But the key thing is: Now we can take our time and get there properly.  

To do the work, build the foundation required to EARN it and keep it.

The clock is off the wall and we, all of us, can focus on rebuilding.  On making Dogecoin not just a monetary revolution, but a social one.  

We can bring the oh-so-Human warmth of empathy and compassion and appreciation to the table and show just how out-dated the current, slow, stone-cold monetary system really is.

A few posts back, I wondered aloud [what our 'why' was](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2g046y/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_245_a_fundamental/).  Why use Dogecoin? What does it hold for those who don't have a reason to care about the Community or anything else?

Last night I came to realize the answer and it was so simple that I couldn't help but laugh:

Dogecoin IS ITSELF the 'Why'.  

We give DOGE to show thanks.  To show that we care.  Because you made us laugh or cry or... feel something *real*.  

Dogecoin isn't just 'money', in fact the 'money' is the least revolutionary thing about us.

Dogecoin allows us to reach out and appreciate someone in a way that matters, that has an impact, **that empowers**.

Dogecoin represents *Connection*.  The exclamation mark at the end of the sentence.  A way to share that goodness inherent inside us, no matter the distance between us.

Remember your first DOGEs?  That first tip?  That feeling of being a part of something?

THAT is Dogecoin.  That's who we are.  That's what you've built here.

A whole lot of people are working hard to take the soul of DOGE and apply it to Cash payments... but I don't think it's going to work in the same way.  There's too much baggage, too many other things come to mind when that money is sitting in your hand.

But the problem has never been the money.

It's the will.  Your will.  Your desire.

And the messed up part is that it's always been there.  That yearning to help.  To connect.

But for a long time, too long, that desire has been snuffed out or lost due to a system of lines and roadblocks and people flat-out telling you 'No'.  

That we do not get to touch the world unless we use their tunnels.  Their railways.

Dogecoin offers you a freedom of a whole other kind.  The freedom to love, to share, to give, to empower as *you* see fit.

Together we've created something that is [putting the 'Human' back into the system](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x2yfx/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_29_the_moon_in_all_its/).  That's [bridging the divide](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1x6h71/of_wolves_and_weasels_day_30_the_gift_of_giving/) in a way that most of us never even realized we were missing.

The ability to help, ourselves.  

To be an active participant in making our own world a better place by personally empowering those whom we believe *make it a better place*.  

Instantly.

That's the Revolution, my friends.

And we're standing at Ground Zero.

It's 9:51AM EST and we've found 92.03% of the initial 100 billion DOGEs - only 7.97% remains until we reach our soft cap! Our global hashrate is down from ~494 to ~450 gigahashes per second and our difficulty is WAY down from ~8639 to ~3969.

As always, I appreciate your support!

personalfinance,"Just got my first job, and am totally lost on how to budget","I just got my first real job out of school, and I have no idea how to create a proper budget. During school, all my budgeting was centred on the idea of minimizing expenses, rather than create something realistic that was in line with my income.


Right now my main concern is finding a new place to live (I'm moving from Toronto, Canada to Portland, OR for work), but I don't know how much to spend on rent. I did the whole 30% of your take home pay, which put me at around $800, which is less than what I am paying now for my student ghetto apartment! That can't be right, can it?


Is it okay to spend more than 30% of my take home on housing if I make cuts in other areas? Specifically, I don't have a car, don't have an debits to pay off, and don't eat out very frequently. Would it be okay to spend 40-45% of my take home on rent?


Also, I don't even know if I calculated the take home pay correct. I did my federal withholding based on [this IRS calculator](http://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/), and then my income tax based on the [federal tax rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Marginal_tax_rates_for_2013), and [Oregon state tax rates](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/state-taxes-oregon.aspx). Basically I just multiplied my income between the different tax brackets by each rate, to find out my total taxes. The taxes plus the withholding come out to ~30% of my gross income. Does that sound right?

---------------------------
  
I'd also like to address some of the common concerns when I try to encourage people to vote:

 * ""They're all the same anyway.""
   * This is demonstrably not true.  Currently our political parties are more polarized than they have been in more than a century.  If we look at [party-line votes in the Senate](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/senate/members/) and [the House of Representatives](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/house/members/) the distance between the parties are obvious.  For the average Redditor the differences between the haven't been as stark in our lifetimes. (These visulizations may be easier to read: [Senate Polarization](http://voteview.com/blog/?p=892) | [House Polarization](http://voteview.com/blog/?p=887))  
 * ""Not voting is the same as a vote of no confidence.""
   * We have tried not voting before.  In fact we have tried not voting sixteen times in the last seventy years.  Less than half of eligible voters turned out for midterm elections in [1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010](http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/voter-turnout/) which means that in 100% of midterm elections since 1950 a *minority* of Americans were allowed to pick a new House of Representatives.
   * Not voting is tantamount to saying ""Things are good enough in my life that I'm going to let you keep your job"" because why would an elected official change anything if they're reelected?  They don't care if they win with 100% turnout or if they win with 10% turnout just as long as they win.
   * Not voting just gives more power to the people who *do* show up.  
 * ""Voting doesn't change anything anyway.""
   * Nothing changes all at once but our history is riddled with slow but steady progress.  We have seen since 2010 the damage that can be caused by a single election, how one bad election can slow progress to a crawl and even drag us backwards.  Voting *can* and *does* make a difference, but first you need to vote.   
 * ""My vote doesn't count.""  
   * No, your vote alone won't win the election.  Vote anyway.  You; by yourself, won't win a tug-of-war, that's why we all work together and we need *you* to pull your weight, especially now.
 * ""My district is [gerrymandered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) too much for the opposition to stand a chance.""
   * Gerrymandering has no effect on state-wide elections, so if you don't vote because of gerrymandering you're missing out on the opportunity to vote for Governor, Senator and any of a number of ballot initiatives.  
 * ""There's no one on the ballot that represents me, or represents my views.""
   * Then you need to represent your views for yourself.  Go to the polling place and write in ""NO CONFIDENCE"" for any; or all, of the eligible seats.  Not voting says nothing but ""Everything is fine, my life is good, I don't want anything to change"" so go and vote ""NO CONFIDENCE"" and make your voice heard.
 * ""If voting changed anything it would be illegal.""
   * For the vast majority of human history voting was functionally illegal, as leaders were picked through birth or war or appointment or God.  The very thought of letting the people vote was considered dangerous and absurd.  
   * When our country was founded it was illegal for anyone except white, land owning males to vote.
   * It was illegal for African Americans to vote until 1870.
   * It was *practically* illegal for African Americans to vote until 1965.
   * It was illegal for women to vote until 1920.
   * It was illegal for 18 year-olds to vote until 1971.  
 * ""Why should I have to choose between a Douche Sandwich and a Giant Turd?""
   * I guess you should have voted in the primaries so that D. Sandwich and G. Turd would never have gotten to the general election... 
   * Also: No human is so black or white, no policy is so clearly right or wrong, no political party is so good or evil.  The Sandwich analogy is a painful oversimplification of both voting and of political candidates.
   
A few good reasons not to vote:

 * You are confident in your neighbors ability to choose who represents you in Congress.
 * You're happy with the way things are and you're worried your vote might change things.
 * ...those two are the only ones that I can think of.
   
There are those who will try to tell you that they're too weak, that they're actions and votes are worthless, that it is better to sit in silence than to stand up and be counted; these people have become so convinced of their powerless impotence that they will try to convince others of the same thing.  Just like an alcoholic will try to force you to drink, the timid will try to force you to stay silent.  Smile and nod and vote anyway, because you are not weak, you are not powerless, you are not impotent unless you let yourself be.

Think of them like the fat friend that's always trying to convince you to eat cake.

The biggest point I would like to make here is that yes, your vote does count.  The person who convinces you not to vote, votes twice.

Income: $800

Rent/utilities: -$330

Internet: -$70

Food/misc supplies: -$200 (Average $50/week)

_____

Net income: +$200

I have about $550 in liquid, as-yet unallocated cash in my bank account. On top of this, I have $1500 in refunded student loan money in my savings. I expect to receive an additional $1500 in January. I plan on using this money as reserves to pay for my living expenses between when I graduate and when I find my first ""real"" job. If all goes according to plan, I will have $5500 (five thousand five hundred, not a typo) in Federal Student loans to pay of when i graduate.

However, it is very tempting for me to delve into my loan reserves to purchase a cheap, private-party used car off of Craigslist. I previously had a car until June of this year, when repairs became too expensive and I had to sell it. I have a cheap bicycle, and public transit is adequate in the area where I live, but I really miss driving. How bad of an idea is it to buy a car now?

personalfinance,Bank closed my credit card account due to postal error. Is it worth it to re-open it?,"I've had a credit card through my bank for about 5 years now. It's a fairly low limit card ($500) because when I got it my credit was crap and I never wanted to get the limit raised. I mainly only use the credit card for emergencies, so often it sits in my wallet collecting dust for awhile. I pay it every month and I've been really good about keeping up on it, which has in turn increased my credit score. (It used to be somewhere in the 500s, and I believe I recently or am getting close to hitting 700.) 

Well I found out that my card expired in June. I never noticed because I haven't used it since then, I've just been paying down some expenses that cropped up earlier in the year. I never  got a replacement, so I called my bank (US Bank) to get it replaced and they said that my mail has been getting returned to them, so they closed my account. I never got any sort of notification on this, so I'm a little upset. The address wasn't wrong, and it's the same address for my savings and my checking accounts, both which I get mail for regularly. 

They said that in order to re-open it, I need to write them a letter with a ton of information (Income, credit card number, address, things like that) and have it faxed in in order to get the credit line re-opened. 

Clearly I'm a little miffed, and part of me doesn't even want to re-open it due to this hassle. But it's through my bank so it's convenient, and the interest rate is low. It's also a line I've had for a little while and I know that reflects well on a credit report. 

**My question is; does the bank closing my account due to a postal error affect my credit score negatively? Will re-opening it reverse that damage? Is it worth it to re-open, or should I just call it a wash?**

personalfinance,How to design a budget with big life changes coming soon?,"In the next 1-2 years, I will be getting married, and I will be fully supporting my wife for at least the first couple of years. She currently lives abroad, so that makes it difficult for me to estimate what our expenses would be living together. One of my biggest expenses is food, so I think adding another person could have a significant impact on that part of my budget.  Should I expect my food budget to double? Increase by about 50%? What are some other big changes I might need to expect?

In addition, I am really wanting to build a home soon. The payment I can afford will of course be highly dependent on how much money I have left after my other expenses. Would it simply be a bad idea to build a house at this point, and just wait until after having been married for a year, so I can get a better idea of what my expenses are? The only thing, is I am very worried about interest rates shooting up with the longer I wait.",finance,1410631436
personalfinance,"Paying off debt, building a contingency fund, and savings in various forms. Advice on the order to do things.","Sorry if this is not the right place for this, please let me know if I should just go to an accountant or some other subreddit.  I have managed to accrue 20,000 in credit card debt, and with my habits it keeps getting worse.  I take home 3800 a month but essentially live paycheck to paycheck.  

My first check goes to mortgage (950) car+insurance (450) and leaves 400 left over.  I pay the minimums on my credit cards (about $200 across 5 accounts, most of the debt is 0% interest until next year) and then get groceries, gas, etc until that cash is gone leading up to the middle of the month.  

My second check I pay my utilities (100 electric, 100 internet/cable, 100 cell phone) and a few other subscriptions, like amazon prime, netflix and some charities (50-100/mo) leaving around $1500.  Depending on how responsible I am being at that time, I'll either splurge with my girlfriend or put a big chunk into my credit cards.  I usually put 500-1000 a month toward the debt.. but then when I run out of money.

My problem has been cyclical, like an addiction.  I used to accrue a few thousand in debt, tighten the belt and pay it off then start over on a new card.  It got out of control when I lost my job for a while, and was trying to stay in a relationship that was unhealthy for both of us.. Long story short, I lived beyond my means for several years mostly on 0% cards and transferred the balances around to make the mess I am in.

I know I need to build a fund of around 3000-4500 for the bare minimum in case of emergency.  I have that in stocks that are fairly liquid that my company matches.  I can take it out once or twice a year, so I use it as kind of a savings account.  Very worst case scenario I could take a loan against my 401k also, to avoid losing the house for example.

I've stopped going out as much, returned some of the toys, and am resolving to be more responsible paying down the debt while not getting any more.  I only use one card now, and that is just for gas to get points, which I pay back immediately.

So finally my question, I bought my house in foreclosure, fixed it up, and I have about 80k of equity in it right now.   Would it make sense to take a low interest equity loan to finish fixing up the house and pay off the credit card debt, then cut all the cards up once and for all?  Transferring the balances around, I pay fees that basically amount to 10-15% APR on the money.  The 0% is going to run out eventually, and I don't think I'll be able to pay it down before that, at which point the debt will be 8-23% across the various cards.  If I have to pay a higher mortgage payment, I won't really notice it.  I am mature enough now that I think if I can finally get out from under this debt and the treadmill of interest, and having that 25-100$ a month back that I'm paying depending on what the interest rates are at the time will help compensate..

Thanks for reading if you did, this is not an easy topic for me to be honest about.

personalfinance,Help selecting a small loan for a medical student,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I'm a 23 year old MD/PhD student attempting to live financially independent on a government stipend. Despite my best budgeting efforts, I've found myself in spot where I could likely use ~$4000-$5000 more a year. 

I've currently got ~$130,000 in debt, but I don't pay tuition anymore. I originally expected to be in over $300,000 in debt by the end of school, so another $25,000 isn't too much of an issue with the salary that I hope to be drawing in about 10 years. 

My question is- where should I look for a loan that I can defer payment for until I graduate, with a fixed low interest rate (besides my dreams). 

Also- my parents are separated and have each gone bankrupt in recent enough history that I'm pretty sure they aren't allowed to co-sign anything for me and I'd rather not have their credit history play a role in the loan agency's decision.

personalfinance,Which should I do next: refinance auto-loan or apply for another CC?,"Hello Personal Finance,

I'm a recent college grad that took out a buttload ($60k) of student loans, let a bunch (4) of miniscule (all less than $150) medical bills go to collections, and bought a new car (I sell real estate and keeping the car I'd had since high school wasn't an option (old, ugly, dented, smelled like cigarettes).

Since graduating, I've been living below my means, have emergency fund, and am throwing excess funds at auto-loan.

Where I'm at right now is:

* I got the BOA Cash Rewards Platinum Plus Visa in Dec. 2013. I put a $100 deposit and they gave me $500 limit. I've paid in full every month since then and haven't paid a cent of interest. I'll get my deposit back this Dec. and hopefully get a CLI.

* I had 4 accounts in collections that were all medical bills. Lots of them were about to fall off because they were reaching 7 year mark. I disputed with Transunion and Transunion deleted all of them. I know there's a risk that they might come back if the CA gets more details about the accounts.

* After disputing accounts with Transunion and Transunion deleting them from credit report, my credit score went up ~50 points, to 650.

* Since I didn't have good credit, or a lengthy credit history, or long time at current job, I didn't get a good interest rate on auto loan. It's currently at 10%. I just made the 6th payment (out of 60) this past month.

* Credit Karma's affiliate lenders/credit card companies are quoting me much lower rates on refinance loans for my car...like 3% - 4%. Credit Karma's also saying I have very good chances of getting one or two credit cards.

Obviously, I need to refinance the auto-loan (current balance is $14,000) as soon as possible. But I also need more CC accounts earlier (so average age of accounts gets older faster).

I know that since it's likely that some or all of the accounts in collections that were deleted may reappear, I should probably refinance my car and apply for new credit cards prior to that happening.

My question: which do I do first? Obviously, I want to refinance my car asap and I want more credit asap. But which should I do first? I don't want to apply for the card, and have the inquiry cause my score to drop to where I get a shittier rate on the refi, but then I also don't want to apply for the refi, then have that screw my chances of applying for a new credit card.

I'm going to apply for the refi through my credit union. They offer really good rates (as low as 1.65%).",finance,1410660603

In that time I made only $2175. But of course, being a contractor a) this income was not taxed and b) I have to file quarterly. It's 1:42 AM in this part of the world, which means taxes are due tomorrow. Shit. BUT I'm not sure if I owe anything. From [this page](http://tax.yale.edu/federal-quarterly-estimated-tax-payments) I found:

&gt; The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires you to make quarterly estimated tax payments for calendar year 2014 if both of the following apply:

&gt; * you expect to owe at least $1,000 in federal tax for 2014, after subtracting federal tax withholding and credits, **and**

&gt; * you expect federal withholding and credits to be less than the smaller of:
        90% of the tax to be shown on your 2014 federal tax return, or
        100% of the tax shown on your 2013 federal tax return (only applies if your 2013 tax return covered 12 months - otherwise refer to 90% rule above only).

Not sure about the second one, but I don't think the first applies. I don't think half my earnings would be paid in taxes, would they? I do have another job now, so I will be making more money this year, but this employer deducts my taxes for me so I don't think that's relevant.

This is my first time filing taxes, so thanks for getting me straightened out!

EDIT: I WAS TAXED LAST YEAR. By the above statement, I just meant *I* wasn't the one who filed them. This is my first year *personally* filing them, so all I meant is *I have no clue what I'm doing, and this is daunting.* Sorry for the confusion.",finance,1410673769

personalfinance,Best way to become financially stable while in grad school?,"Sorry in advance about the long post but thank you to anyone who can offer advice.  I finished undergrad this past May and started working full time towards my PhD. I'd like some advice on the best way to become financially stable while still in school. Here is my relevant info:


- ~$16,500 in student loans although I'm not required to make payments until I finish my degree. $3,500 is an unsubsidized loan at 6.8% interest and the rest is are subsidized loans at 3.4% interest (although effectively 0% until I graduate.)

- $18,000 per year stipend plus full tuition as part of my assistantship package.

- ~$750 in expenses (Rent, Utilities, Food, Spending Money), so ~$750 leftover each month.

- I don't currently have any kind of emergency fund as most of my savings went to various school related expenses (new computer, textbooks, apartment security deposit, etc.)

- Aside from my loans I don't have much of a credit history, but I recently was approved for a credit card through my bank with a $1,000 limit that I plan to use for all my everyday expenses like groceries.


I've read the FAQ and some other posts and know that it is generally recommended to pay off debt before investing but since my loans have such a low interest rate would it be more helpful to invest since I don't have to pay them yet?


 My original plan was to pay off the unsubsidized loan as quickly as possible (probably in 5-6 months) and then not pay the rest until I graduate since they're not generating any interest. Is this a good idea or should I just go ahead and pay them down over the next 2-3 years while in school? 


If investing is a better idea what is the best way to start that? I should have enough left over after paying off the unsubsidized loan to make the maximum contribution to an IRA for this year. Since I'm only 20 that should give me the best bang for my buck with compound interest over the next 45 years, correct? What about next year when I'd have more available to invest than I'd be able to contribute?


Finally, besides paying down the loans and making sure to pay off the credit card in full each month is there anything else I can proactively due to build my credit before having to buy a car/house in the next few years after graduating?",finance,1410677900

Koch Bros Are Back With More Net Neutrality Opposition 

http://stopthecap.com/2010/05/11/americans-for-prosperity-backed-by-big-telecom-is-back-with-more-net-neutrality-opposition/ 

Americans for Prosperity, the group that harassed residents of Salisbury, North Carolina last year with push polls and recorded phone messages opposing municipal broadband, is renewing its effort to sign up the tea party crowd to oppose Net Neutrality reforms. 

Ostensibly representing those favoring “less government,” AFP is actually ﻿﻿a corporate front group founded by oil billionaire David Koch but also backed by telecom interests. The group shills for large phone and cable companies to keep them deregulated, and opposes consumer reforms. The group’s spokesman on Net Neutrality is Phil Kerpen — a regular on Fox News — appearing on Glenn Beck’s program to nod in agreement to wild claims that Net Neutrality is Maoist. 

Now the group has unveiled a new advertisement opposing Net Neutrality and is spending $1.4 million dollars in its first ad buy. The 30-second ad targets legislators with wild claims about Net Neutrality that don’t pass even the most rudimentary truth tests. 

Comparing Net Neutrality with Washington-directed bailouts of banks and the auto industry, the group claims Washington wants to “spend billions to take over the Internet.” Apparently the Internet is available for purchase on eBay. 

In reality, the only group with the deep pockets is this debate is America’s telecommunications companies, who are among the biggest spenders for lobbyists, astroturf campaigns that claim to represent consumer interests, and writing big campaign contribution checks to state and federal elected legislators. 

Establishing Net Neutrality protections doesn’t cost billions. Fighting against establishing Net Neutrality might. 

In fact, the biggest expense the Federal Communications Commission faces in its efforts to adopt Net Neutrality reforms will come from legal expenses brought about by continuous provider lawsuits.",technology,1410697166

Anyway I've decided to save aggressively towards a home purchase in slightly over 2 years time. I have started putting $1,500 away a month (about 1/3 of my salary) with a target of $40,000. 

I live in Singapore where bank interest rates are generally very poor. Because it's progressive savings and a relatively short time period should I stick the money in a fixed deposit account? Is there a point putting the money in an ETF?

personalfinance,Should I sell my car to finance my education?,"Hi PF!

   After a family crisis, I'm finally back in college and set to graduate next spring (2016). I'm currently funded by state and federal grants.

However, I have determined that my financial aid will be pulled before I graduate due to how many course credits I've accrued. Curse my younger self for wasting opprotunity.

Anyway, I've determined that, with good planning, I will only need to finance one semester all by myself. I estimate this to be around ~$5,000, taking into account increasing tuition costs, books, etc.

   I'm already $20,000 in student loan debts and I'd like to avoid increasing them if possible. But its obviously more worth it to finish the degree.

   I just looked up the bluebook value of my car and found it to be ~$5,500. I bike to school and have access to another car most of the time, so I'm not really going to need my own guaranteed transport until I graduate.

Selling the car would also save me on car insurance. More than Geico can.

Other Options:
   I am qualified for Subsidized Stafford Loans. They don't accrue interest while I am enrolled in college, so would it be worth it for me to take out more loans and let them accrue in a savings account or investment account until I need the money? 


TL;DR was stupid, made mistakes, need $5000 a year from now. Should I sell $5,500 car or take subsidized loans?",finance,1410714001

The banks I'm looking at are Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Halifax, Natwest and Metro.

personalfinance,Wife and I need some advice on planning for our future together,"Hey guys,

So my wife and I are in over our heads in determining how to save for our future. We're in our early 20s, and very recently married. We've read over the FAQs and a lot of threads in here, but we would really appreciate some specific advice on how to allocate our money for savings/debt payment.  

Right now, we make a total of roughly $63,000 after taxes year. That leaves us with $5,250 per month that we have budgeted in the following way:  

* $315/month for gas/car insurance
* $1358 for rent/utilities
* $220/month cell phones &amp; internet
* $300/month entertainment
* $800/month food/general household items
* $300/month towards random misc. expenses (gifts, maintenance, medical, etc.)
* $100/month personal loan w/ 0% interest
* $173/month student loan min payment  

We're wondering how to best allocate the additional ~$1700 every month that we have left over.  


We also have around $20k in savings and checking that we're trying to determine how best to distribute between the following:  


- emergency fund
- car down payment
- house down payment
- roth ira for both of us (neither employer has a 401k match)
- ~16k student loans
	- $11k w/ 3.15% interest rate
	- $5k w/ 4.25% interest rate  

We'd like to buy a car within the next year, so we'd like to have ~6-7k saved for that. We're unsure whether Roth IRAs or student loans should come first given the interest rates, and where saving for a home fits into all of this.",finance,1410721357

personalfinance,Overpaying a SoFi consolidation loan?,"Hey folks - 

Wondering if anyone else has consolidated their student loans into a SoFi loan? If so, have you seen any terms that prevent you from overpaying your monthly payment? 

I'm looking at refinancing into a single loan from SoFi instead of my 3 distinct accounts with multiple loans on each. Kicker is that my blended interest rate should drop from ~7.5% (depends on my one big variable rate loan, currently at 3.25%) down to somewhere in the 3-4% range depending on what is offered to me by Sofi. 

Ultimately, though, my repayment range will extend with this option (go from 7.5 years remaining on my loans up to a 15 year Sofi loan)! So I want to make sure there's no penalties for overpaying this new loan, and I haven't seen a full promissory note from SoFi yet, so I do not have their full terms. 

Any insight from other SoFi customers is much appreciated!",finance,1410726710

personalfinance,Building a new house - rent or buy a rental while building?,"I never post anything on reddit, but this seems like a fairly well rounded set of people answering questions, so here goes:
1. Planning on building new house in the spring. We already own the land.
2. Before we can start construction, we want to sell our existing residence. Primarily because we need the equity to put down on the other house, but also for peace of mind. 
3. We have looked into the rental market, and anything suitable for us would be between $1500 and $2000/mo. Also of note- it is difficult to find anyone who will do less than a one year lease. We would need to rent for 7-8 months. 
4. We could buy a rent house (we own one currently), live in it for the period of time we would otherwise be renting. Suitable house or duplex would be between 110k and 200k. 

Here is the dilemma- other than our emergency fund, we have limited cash for the down payment on the rent house because we poured all of it into the land for the new house. 

Options We've considered:
1. Borrowing from 401k - since the rental would be a ""primary residence"" initially, we could finance what we borrow for up to 20 yrs. if we did this, obviously I'm paying that back to myself over however long the financing period is. The interest rate is 4.45%, so there are some opportunity costs associated with this approach, even though the market is very high right now. 
2. Refinance our other rental to pull the down payment on the new rental out of it. I'm cash flowing about $400/mo on it, so conceivably, I could still cover 10% expense margin and cash flow a little on the existing rental.
3. Do nothing and rent. It just kills me to throw away $10 to $15k and have nothing in return. 
Interested in your thoughts or other ideas.
Thanks.",finance,1410729186

personalfinance,(CAN) Help for a young adult just beginning to save,"Long story short, I want to start saving and being financially smart (because I was a dumb kid who spent all her money already...damn). EDIT: I have a part-time job that pays bi-weekly. I make around 300$ in the 2 weeks.

I've read the FAQs and looked around and here's what I'm thinking of. I have 170 dollars. I want to open up 4 accounts, a spending and payment account, a savings account, a student account, and a emergency funds account.

My percentage for each account is, emergency funds 25%, savings 30%, spending and payment 15%, and student loans 30%.

The bank account for spending and payment is an e-savings account that gives 1.05% interest rate, for savings it's (0 - 999$) 0.025% and goes up from there (highest % is 0.150 for $5000+), for emergency funds it's (0 - 999$) 0% and goes up from there (highest % is 0.350 for $250,000+), and student account is 0% interest. 

I'm thinking of switching the bank type of the savings account to the emergency account and vice versa. Or should I open up two of the same bank account types for my savings and emergency account?

I have some questions and all help is most appreciated. Should I use a bank account with an interest rate for my student account? Should I switch the bank types of my savings account to emergency account and vice versa? Is my % division for each account (ie. 30% to savings) alright?

I am also working on a masters degree in IT, with hopes that it will lead to more diverse career opportunities than my current technical support work experience and English degree currently offer. I want to eventually work in Information Security, most likely focusing on application security and web development projects.  I don't have to stay in graduate school full-time as I'm going right now. Through my job, since I work for the school I'm attending, I get a tuition waiver for 3 classes a year. This ends up covering a lot of the COA. 
   
**Particulars to consider...** 

* I have around 100K in student loan debt from last 10 years.  A bulk of this is in federal loans. I have two private loans, one with Sallie Mae and is my lowest interest loan due to my mom co-signing when I was younger, and the other is my highest interest loan with Discover which I hope to have paid off in the next 12 months.  
* I have a bit of credit card debt from a recent computer purchase, but that could be paid off in a couple of months.  Probably about 2K total.  
 
* My credit is good rating.  

I know that I look less than dreamy on paper right now, but I am curious about the potential to buy instead of continuing to rent. I make around 42K per year before taxes/deductions. Benefits I could see buying this house would be: equity, tax deductions (maybe?), land to plant a garden (I'm vegan, so I could possibly save a lot on veg this way), and being close proximity to work in a safe neighborhood on the school bus-line, I could take public transport to work and home most days (or bike). 
  
I realize that with home ownership comes extra finances, such as maintenance, insuranace, the mortgage, taxes... but whose not to say I might not spend around the same amount on rent each month as it is? There is a house that has been on the market for at least a year now for 158K. I might have some power to talk it down given its time on market. It needs some updates, but there's a lot of character to the property and the house and it's in a trendy and pretty safe neighborhood near good schools and a large public park. The house is in live-in condition, just outdated in some ways. There is even a wired workshop, so with my desire to learn some carpentry skills, I could easily start on that journey toward updating on my own (cabinets, for example).

solar,"Sold my home with solar panels, looking into options on the new home.","I had solar panels on my old home, had them installed in 2009 I believe, it worked out very well.  I owned them, and the deal we worked out with the company was essentially about $25K after rebates, I got about $13K back from federal and state tax credits, plus the company paid for a new roof, so I got a 6 KW system plus roof for approx. $12K.  I was saving about $1200/year before I sold the house, and got a lot more than the comps in the area and the buyers said it was because of the panels.

So I was definitely interested in getting them on the new house as well, except after renovations there's no cash left to lay down on a new system.  I've been looking into leasing possibilities, just to save on my electric bills, but with the slope of the roof the panels will be very obvious and my wife isn't thrilled with the asthetics.  

I got some stuff recently in the mail from a company I hadn't heard of before called Plant (myplant.com) that seems to be partnered with Dow, offering solar shingles at no upfront cost - WITH a free roof.  My current roof is shit and needs to be replaced, I've gotten offers from roofers ranging from $14K - 19K which is out of my range right now.  I've heard that the shingles are not as efficient as the regular panels, but I'm not sure if the savings on getting a free roof will offset that enough.  I happen to live two doors down from a Solar City rep and I've heard great things about them (and I'm a big fan of Elon Musk) but I don't think they do shingles.

Anyone ever do business with this company, or use solar shingles yourself?  Any advice, thoughts will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

EDIT: My rationale is that the $200/month goes toward literally nothing. Doesn't pay down the loan and isn't tax deductible (or is it?). On a normal payment plan, I'd be paying PMI for 8 years, which is $9,600. Even taking an 84-month personal loan for $30,000 at 8%, I would pay $9,277.26 in interest, so It's basically a wash since both don't build equity.  Even though the cost is a wash, I'd trim $30,000 off of my mortgage while doing so which has big savings (pay off mortgage 7 years earlier and save $65,000 in interest).",finance,1410794928

My apologies if I'm not supposed to ask for tax advice here, I spent some time looking for the best place to ask on Reddit and this seems to be it.

I'm a US citizen that started working for a foreign company at the end of July.  I work over the internet, so I'm in the US.  Independent contractors are required to pay both quarterly taxes and file a tax return on April 15th.  

According to the first page of the 1040-ES, if you weren't obligated to pay taxes in 2013 and didn't file a return, you don't have to pay taxes for the current year.  This should apply to me.  I think that means I start on April 15th like everyone else, and that's also when I start my quarterly payments.

However, I was wondering if this exception includes not only the federal tax, but also the self-employment tax and the Medicaid tax as well.  For those unaware, the self-employment tax is essentially FICA.

I tried asking the IRS but they don't offer live, over-the-phone advice.

I greatly appreciate any helpful answers.

Bitcoin,How to sound like a genius as a Bitcoin newb.,"It’s time for more bitcoin conference porn!  The fall schedule (glut) kicks off today in London with an Inside Bitcoins conference.  Unfortunately, I’ll miss it.  Instead, I’ll be at MIT giving a presentation on how students there can scale from “Zero to One” in Bitcoin.

My favorite slide of the short overview, which is also relevant to #bitcoinconf attendees is without a doubt how to simply “sound smart” as a newcomer to Bitcoin.  That’s really half of the battle; I’ve learned from personal experience.  Leaders in this industry who are exponentially smarter than me were willing to talk to me as a peer mere weeks after I first learned about bitcoin last November, mostly because I faked it ‘til I made it.*  

So I feel a moral responsibility to share ten things that can make any newb sound like a seasoned vet.  Much like a pick-up artist**, you’ll have to craft your own style and will look silly occasionally, but at least you can sleep easy knowing that you will fool 99% of onlookers with this framework.  

Here are my top ten tips for sounding smarter than you really are when it comes to Bitcoin…

1) Know simple BTC grammar.  Discredit anyone who misspells bitcoin as BitCoin or bit coin, and gently correct those who conflate Bitcoin the protocol (capitalized) with bitcoin the currency (lower-case).  This is a slam dunk, I’ve-been-here-a-while, pro tip.  Don’t be a jerk about it, but politely help this other newcomer scale to your level of intelligence.

Congrats, you’re already ahead of the curve.

2) Acknowledge that bitcoin is a crappy currency, but a high-potential commodity.  Bitcoin is volatile and will be for a very long time.  It’s designed to appreciate in value or to fail — without much middle ground.  As a unit of account or store of value, it’s terrible, but it is also a very high-potential commodity.  Holding the “currency” means (among other things) that you are betting bitcoin displaces gold as a long-term reserve — that one inherently worthless commodity (gold) will be replaced by another (bitcoin), because bitcoin will at least be tied to a very valuable network.  You also believe that as the critical exchange, investment, and derivative infrastructure is built out, mainstream people will use what are essentially fiat-denominated bitcoins anyway (thanks to hedging wizardry).  Oh, and on that last point, you’ll stop referring “dollars” and instead reference “fiat.”

3) Point out that all currencies fluctuate in relative value, but at least BTC appreciates. This is in some ways a close corollary to #2.  People like to criticize bitcoin’s “extreme” volatility, but the truth is that the currency’s volatility is falling and will continue to fall steadily as it grows larger.  Moreover, it will look less volatile relative to the currencies of many smaller, developing economies, especially those with high inflation like Argentina or Nigeria.  (BTC is the 90th most popular global currency by M1.)  At least with bitcoin, you have a ~50% chance on any given day that you’ll enjoy upside volatility, instead of slow and steady devaluation.  Many people outside of the US and Europe are going to play those odds.

4) Understand that Bitcoin is not decentralized, it is distributed.  There are basically 10 people in the world who ultimately control Bitcoin right now, so it’s not decentralized.  You’ve got 5-10 Bitcoin core developers who contribute updates to the code base only if they are accepted by the 5-10 mining behemoths that call the shots.  In theory, anyone can “fork” the Bitcoin core if they don’t like the miners’ rules, but most people will agree that this is infeasible at best.  It doesn’t help that no one knows who controls most of the global mining power or even who invented Bitcoin.  Sounds shady, and in truth, it is more of a black box than most will admit.  The good news is that the block chain is universally distributed, so at least people can see the global ledger of transactions, even if they don’t appreciate that a group smaller than the Fed actually controls Bitcoin.   

Brownie points if you know who Gavin Andresen is, because many newbs don’t!  I’ll put it to you this way: Gavin is bitcoin’s Mark Zuckerberg to Satoshi’s Winklevii — if only the Winkevoss twins had come up with a clever seigniorage model for social networking and faded to the background gracefully once they had Zuck on board.  Gavin and the other core developers aren’t household names by pure chance — the media is simply too obsessed with the mysterious Satoshi. 

5) Admit that Bitcoin is not cheaper than credit cards.  A common pitch is that bitcoin is much cheaper than credit cards, but this simply is not true in most real-world use cases.  Bitcoin merely appears less expensive for most retail transactions because those charging the transaction fees - the miners - care more about the large 25 BTC / block mining reward subsidies than they do the variable transaction fees.  For now.  As mining gets more expensive and the mining reward shrinks over the next decade, bitcoin’s transaction fees will start looking a heck of a lot more like interchange rates.  In addition, if you go up one level to the payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase, either the merchant or the consumer (or a combination) is paying 100-150 basis points to cover bitcoin transaction costs - not a tremendous price difference from card networks.  

Bitcoin has many advantages over credit cards — security, interoperability, universality, etc. — but cost generally isn’t one of them.

6) Remittances aren’t a near-term killer app; cross-border transactions are.  As much as bitcoiners like to bash Western Union and Money Gram, and as despicable as some of these remittance platforms can be, they still exist for a reason.  Doing safe, secure and legal remittance is more expensive than it seems at first glance.  And while it’s nice to think that crypto could flow freely to those already familiar with mobile money, this theory has one big flaw: the infrastructure and awareness for bitcoin isn’t even close to there yet in developing economies.  Sure, a migrant worker could send bitcoin to a relative’s mobile phone in Zimbabwe, but good luck safely exchanging that for usable day-to-day currency - especially at a cheaper rate than the evil remittance empires.  

Business to business cross-border transactions, on the other hand, are infinitely more likely to succeed on a faster timeline.  More sophisticated parties, with better access to bitcoin exchanges and financial services, solving a more straightforward and nominally larger problem.

7) Pick at least one bitcoin company to hate, and know why you hate them so much.  I honestly don’t think I’ve met a single person in this industry who hasn’t completely crapped all over at least one leading bitcoin company behind closed doors.  In fairness, even when I’m not playing devil’s advocate, I have still been legitimately guilty of giving the business to all of these companies myself.  But for most non-bully-pulpiteers, it’s simply easier and less abrasive to whisper criticisms.  It doesn’t matter whether you pick Circle (“Wall Street sell-outs”), Coinbase (“young, naive and overextended”), Xapo (“shady insurance dealings”), Blockchain (“short-sighted ideologues”), or BitPay (“first, but not best”).  All that matters is that you hate at least one of them.  

8) Tell everyone how much you love Andreas, but that he’s too political for your liking. First you have to watch an Andreas Antonopoulos presentation and learn how to spell Antonopoulos.  He speaks beautifully and sincerely and intelligently, and if Aaron Sorkin ever wrote a show about bitcoin, Andreas would be the protagonist, a la President Bartlet (West Wing) or Will McAvoy (Newsroom).  He’s a perfect embodiment of what bitcoin should be — indeed, it’s fun to believe in his type of future — but the realist in you knows to just eat popcorn while watching this artist at work.  You don’t actually need to believe what he says for bitcoin to go mainstream.  In fact, if you are easily influenced, you probably shouldn’t because many of his most strongly held beliefs simply aren’t practical.

9) Learn the defensive pitch for the Bitcoin Foundation.  It goes something like this: “You know, it’s not that easy to herd cats in this industry and these guys have been very valuable in serving as a voice for such a diverse community.  At the end of the day, none of the leading entrepreneurs have time to do much advocacy work outside of their own companies, and the Bitcoin Foundation is crucial in promoting investment in the Bitcoin core technology.  It’s easy to criticize them — and look, they’ve definitely made some mistakes — but like most non-profits, these guys are underpaid, overworked and only get criticism, never praise.”  The more you say this, the truer it sounds.  (See TBI, March 2014, for why this is ironic.) 

10) Rehearse this phrase or some close iteration of it.

""Ethereum is really interesting, but it just seems like they will have an uphill battle to beat out Bitcoin innovations like side chains and tree chains given Bitcoin’s network effects.""***  

If you want to immediately be deified like a core developer, state this with confidence and maintain eye contact with your listener during cocktail hour, then just shake hands and walk away.  This is a newb trump card, and it sounds smart on so many levels that you will leave your audience with no choice but to admire your crypto fluency.  Uttering this phrase without stammering usually comes with an admission ticket to any conference VIP after-party you’d like.  (I usually just use one of my several aliases, until one of them is on the list.) 

Good luck!


*Still trying to make it.

**There are actually a surprising number of former and current pick-up artists in bitcoin.  No joke.  (I’m not one of them.)

***Full disclosure: I have said this verbatim and still don’t know what it means.  But it sounds smart.

My question is this: What I would specifically like to know is how to approach the renewal issue. With the 5 year, I will have an additional year locked in at a low rate. Assuming rates will go up in a few years time would it make sense to hedge my bets on a 5 year fixed or should I go with a 4 year and make more payments? how should I approach this issues to gain a clear idea of what my long-term view should be?

personalfinance,Debt consolidation loan?,"Hey all, pretty new to this sub so I'm not sure if this has been covered.  My fiancee and I just came out of college and between us, we've got about $6,000 in credit card debt.  We're not struggling on any of them, but we've also got other finances (car loan/insurance, rent, the usual stuff) that make me worry that we won't be able to pay these off for a year or two at least.  About $2,000 of it is still interest-free for another year, but interest on the rest is between 15% and 20%.

I've seen some commercials for these kinds of loans, but they seem to have some very negative connotations.  I guess I'm wondering if I go to a credit union or the like, will I be able to get much better of an interest rate and/or a lower monthly payment? Does anyone have any positive experience with them?

(And if I get one, I do feel comfortable that I won't go right back out and max the credit cards back out, though any warnings or words of wisdom are still welcome)",finance,1410808012
personalfinance,Credit debt is out of control yet I have a reasonable salary and need advice on balance transfer/interest rate management (UAE) Help!,"hello everyone,

first of all thank you to everyone in this sub. i read it quite a bit and am inspired by how much the community helps ones another out and have learned a lot.

for the sake of clarity i'll say that i'm currently residing in the UAE where the currency is dirhams (AED) and the exchange rate to dollars is $3.65 to USD (3.65 AED = $1)

my current salary is AED AED 10,500 or $2,876. upon moving here i got a credit card with low interest rate and due to a lot of factors including my own irresponsibility (but also very high rent, unexpected expenses and lots of travel) i racked up AED 27,000 in debt ($7,397).

this card was 0% interest for a while and i foolishly let it get out of control. i also foolishly thought that paying the minimum payment would mean that i would not get hit with the 'deferred payment charge' which is the 3.09% interest on the overall balance. now i am completely focused on reducing this to a manageable figure in the next 3-4 months so that the interest rate doesn't keep fucking me. last month the charge was about AED 650 ($178).

i did some research and found that i can transfer the balance to another card over 36 payments (months) for 0.79% or fewer months at a higher rate (don't have that info yet). if i make a lump-some payment and break the contract the penalty is 1% of the remaining balance. 

**do you folks have any advice on balance transfers in general to avoid higher interest rates?** *my understanding is that this sub should generate discussion that involves the whole community so that is my main question. i will however post my general expenses so that those of you who are feeling generous can give me any feedback on general strategies on how to tackle this.*

**monthly expenses:** 

salary: **10500** ($2876)

rent: **3325** ($910) *unfortunately this is the cheapest place i can find. rent here is insane. also i have no car*

utilities/internet: approx **675** ($185)

transportation/phone: approx **900** ($250)

groceries: **1400** ($385)

gym: **250** ($70)

medical insurance: **350** ($100)

credit card payment **2000** ($550)

**TOTAL: AED 8,900 or $2,438**


upon finding out about this troublesome charge i decided that i will increase my monthly payments for the next few months and cut down on expenses as much as possible. now it feels like no matter how much i pay i am taking one step forward and half a step back. while i am quite frugal (as seen by my modest expenditure above) i have a long distance relationship and live in a city where i know no one. every few months i travel and my credit card debt jumps back up. she should be moving here in the next 2-3 months so hopefully that won't be an issue anymore. that and i have to act more responsibly :/

personalfinance,"How do I improve my credit score, if my only apparent problem is late payments?","So, graduated law school, had no money, ran out of deferment time. Long story short, my loans went unpaid for about 12 months, and I have 46 late payments on my credit report. The only other black mark is a credit card that defaulted 4 years ago, which I settled with a debt collector. My credit score is 576 according to Mint, which goes through Experian.

Anyway. According to Mint, I'm in the red/poor category with payment history as a result (92% on time), with ""not bad"" starting at 98%. Every other category, I'm in the ""excellent"" range. So, presuming I make every payment on time, I would have to get to 2,300 payments for the 46 lates to be just 2% of my total payments made. That's a long ways off.

So, a few questions with that in mind.

1. Is Mint being accurate with this, roughly?

2. Is there an easy way to increase my score? I know normally paying down credit card debt is the recommended method, but I obviously can't do that.  
On a related note: 2(a). My fiancee has had a credit card for about 7 years with a spotless payment record. Would getting added as a full debtor on that card help my credit at all?

3. I make payments on 17 loans a month (wooooo law school and bad consolidation offers). However, they're billed in 3 chunks: private lender, Department of Ed, and Federal. Does this mean that I am getting 3 on-time payments credited every month, or 17? Just because if the answers to 2 are what I expect, that'd cut the time to get to 2,300 significantly.

4. Should I just get a secured card and start making payments there?",finance,1410809812

personalfinance,Question about refinancing my student loans.,"I'll try and keep this concise, but my question is, should I look into refinancing my student loans?

I have been paying them for a little over a year now. Total I owe about $12,700 in subsidized loans. The loans are broken down into 4 groups within the same lender with varying interest rates. The lowest is 3.4% and the highest is 6.0%

I have exceeded my monthly payments which began around $150 a month to the point where my minimum payment each month is around $50-$60. I continue to pay between $150-180 a month as to not get hit quite as hard by the interest, and so far I have never missed a payment. I use CreditKarma and have been offered some refinancing options that have lower interest rates over longer periods of time.

* Is refinancing a loan going to negatively impact my credit score purely because I refinanced?

* If I get a lower interest, longer period loan, could I continue to pay the same amount each month but end up paying less interest in the end?

My current plan has been to pay as much as I can afford until the loan is down to just a few hundred dollars, at which point I would pay much less each month so that I can continue to build my credit off of the loan without letting the interest erode my bank account. 

So what does /r/personalfinance think about the possibility of refinancing as well as my current plan?",finance,1410817871

I've already tightened the belt a little and I'm managing to spend about a thousand less per month but I'm still worried about being able to make all my payments. 

I have a pension fund with a cashout value of about 35k (before taxes in Iowa) that I can roll over into a 401k when I find a new job or an IRA. But I'm also buried under about 28k of high interest credit card debt. I'm not sure what I'd be left with after taxes after cashing out the pension, but the monthly credit card payments leave me with very little left for savings or unexpected expenses. Of course, I've also got student loans, 2 car payments, and a mortgage but the interest rates and payments on those are all pretty low. I don't know that I'll have the same earning potential just starting out in a new career so all those monthly payments might end up being more than I can handle.

Does anyone have any opinions either way? Getting out of a lot of debt is really tempting, but giving up a decade of retirement savings is a hard pill to swallow too.

My fiance just got a job that matches my income, so we effectively have double the income. In addition, I just paid off a $550/month payment, and a $200 per month student loan. We still have more loans to pay off, but we have easily budgeted for those.

We'll be able to put away about 3K per month into savings after calculating monthly expenses, so we're in a good place! we don't have our emergency fund yet, but that's soon to come.

Even with all that savings, since I just finished off those two payments we will have another $700 per month we could put into savings. I would rather put some of this into a car payment though.

During the summer you would like to focus on rest and relaxation, but you can't let your guard down when it comes to identity theft.

Identity thieves do not take the summer off, and they know your summer activities could give them the opening they need to get your [personal information](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Corliss-Group-Luxury-Travel-Agency/304850289653061).

For example, when you pack your bags for your family vacation, you could be carrying too many [personal documents](http://thecorlisstravelgroup.tumblr.com/). Consumer Reports recommends you leave things like your Social Security card at home.

It's advice one local mother tells Ruth to the Rescue she's already following. ""I only bring one major credit card and my driver's license. Usually American Express so that I know I can have fraud protection. And I always make sure that there's a safe,"" said Kristin Saracevic of Troy.

If you're traveling abroad you'll need a passport and there are some simple steps you can take to protect that document as well. Creditcard.com suggests you remember the three R's when you travel.

1) Remove! As we just mentioned, don't take documents like your Social Security card and birth certificate on vacation. You don't want them falling into the wrong hands.

2) Record! Make copies of key documents (front and back) and keep them in a separate suitcase. If you lose your passport or credit cards, having those copies will help you get replacements more quickly. You can leave those copies in the hotel safe as well.

3) Recover! Be sure to contact your local police station if your cards are stolen or compromised to make sure you have a paper trail. Also, hang onto that police report, your bank or credit card may need copies later on.

**Alert Credit Card Company About Travel**

Before traveling you should also call your bank or credit card issuer before the trip to let them know you're traveling just in case a fishy purchase pops up so they won't flag the purchases.

Robin Riutta of Birmingham recently had a similar situation happen to her, fortunately she informed her credit card company where she would be and when she would be home. ""Someone just recently had my husband's card, but luckily the credit card company called us and asked us a couple questions and we said absolutely not, it's not us.""

**Beware Public WiFi**

Another sneaky way scammers can steal your identity involves using fake WiFi networks. When you're checked into a hotel make sure you check the hotels authorized network. Never do personal business on a unsecured public WiFi. ""I think it's horrible, I think that in this day in age with technology the way it is that there should be something to be able protect what we're doing online."" said Kristin Saracevic of Troy.

**Fake Hotel Calls**

Also, be on high alert if you get a call from the front desk asking for credit card information. The Federal Trade Commission warns if a hotel really has an issue with your card managers will ask you to come to the front desk and deal with the problem face to face. If you get a call from someone saying they are from the front desk, tell them you'll come to the front desk, and they follow up with management.

**Protect Your Children's Identities Too!**

Even your kids aren't safe from identity theft. The FTC warns parents to make sure your child's information is stored safely while they're away at camp or a summer program. When asked about keeping her children safe mother Kristin Saracevic had some solid advice ""I would ask the questions, where is this going? Do you lock this information up? What's your security system? Because now you can never be too careful.""

personalfinance,Options for lender who gave me negative remarks,"Recently, I have had the need for a higher credit score due to trying to obtain business loans. Because of this I have been going through my credit reports/scores to figure out ways to improve it.
  
As per my TU score of 3-4 months ago was around 650 with a total of 4 negative remarks - 1 collection, 1 30day late pay on a credit card, and 2 30 day latepays on a mortgage I have.
  
TBH The late pay &amp; collections were mostly legitimate. I forgot to pay the CCs, and for the collection I just didn't have the time to pay that specific bill (Medical) and did after it went to collections.
  
The Mortgage late pays though are absolute, unoquivical BS. 
  
The first late pay was due to an error on the website from what I can tell. I had auto-pay set up between the mortgage website &amp; my bank. On the 30th of the month that was due (Already due on the 16th, so it was over by 14 days) I got a call from the mortgage company telling me it was late and needed paid immediately. I went to the bank and asked them and they said there had been no withdraws on the account from the mortgage company, nor anyone that could have been associated with them. I called the mortgage company again and they said they were 'sure it was on the side of the bank'. I went through this for 2-3 days, the mortgage company saying they couldn't process a payment and my local bank saying that the money was obviously in the account and there were no problems. I ended up overnighting them a cashier's check for the mortgage, but by this time it had already showed up on my credit report.
  

I called them and threw a fit with a manager, and she assured me that it wasn't a big deal and that they would either take it off on request, or it would be removed after the account was in good standing for a while. (Never happened).
  
About a year later (This march), I got another glorious call from them on the 30th or the 31st of the month, informing me that they had not recieved any payment for the mortgage. I investigated with my bank and found out that the auto-draft on the 10th had gone through as always. I called them back and they said that they did do an auto-draw, but it was for a escrow overage. I had not got any information up till that time that there was any escrow shortfall. Only that it was late. I once again overnighted a check to them to take care of it, but once again I was hit with another charge. I asked them if it could be removed since I was never notifed and they told me they would do it if I faxed a specific department with a request.
 
So, after a month or two of the most recent incident, I faxed the department they requested a letter asking for them to remove the negative remarks. I waited a month and nothing transpired regarding my credit report. Right around this time, a business associate of mine told me he had a similar problem, and had hired one of those internet lawfirms. He told me they did a pretty good job getting some late pays taken off from one of his credit cards and it improved his score signfiicantly, so that he could get a low/no interest credit card.
  
So, I ended up signing up with his suggested company, gave them what they needed and waited. About 2 months later I got a letter from Trans-Union stating that the collection on the account had been removed from my report. This took my credit score from 650 all the way up to 719 (Woo hoo!).  This made me estatic, but still very much upset that the mortgage blemishes were still there. Maybe I'm wrong but I really do feel like they're illigitimate marks on my report, and I would really like to find a way to get them removed.",finance,1410839093

I've read all that I can from the FAQ here and still have some questions.

1. I'm a federal employee so I have a TSP (Roth) matched at 5% all going into a L2050 fund.  But I was also thinking about opening a Roth IRA; I heard Vanguard is a good choice for that.  If that's a good idea, I'm wondering how I should be depositing money into those accounts.  

My Question: If my TSP is already set to 5%, would it be better to put anything extra into the TSP or into the Vanguard Roth IRA?  Or is there no sense in a Roth IRA until I'm able to first max out my TSP at $17,500 every year?

2. I heard that when I loan out from my TSP, as I pay it back I'm actually paying myself back.  And that the interest I'm paying goes to me, too.  If that's true, then is there anything wrong with taking out a TSP loan (assuming it gets paid back)?  Are contributions frozen or is there some kind of other penalty?

3. I'm confused about the difference between a Savings Account and Money Market Account.  I heard that Money Market gives grater returns, but when I compare the two accounts from Synchrony Bank, it looks like the Savings Account is better (0.95% for Savings vs. 0.85% for Money Market).

Thanks so much for any advice.

I owe about 10,500 on my current DD and pay double the payment each month. It's loan is at 2.5% so it's been manageable. I received 5,500 for the old jeep so I would owe around 5 after paying it down some more. 

My next problem is that my current DD doesn't suit my needs as well as it could (I haul a lot of dirty things frequently) I feel that I could get a decent pickup truck with the proceeds of the old Jeep. I feel that I am pretty decent with a wrench and occasional repairs do not scare me at all. 

So what should I do, pay down (not off) loan or cut bait and trade it in on wife's car?",finance,1410873183

&amp;nbsp;

**Republic vs Democracy** 

* **What did the founders envision?**
* **Where does the US government currently stand?**

&amp;nbsp;

If you were to ask most Americans what type of government the US has, they would say that it is a democracy. Yet, our ""Pledge of Allegiance"", which millions of American children recite every morning before school, calls our country a republic. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with Liberty and Justice for all.

&amp;nbsp;

So which one is it and what is the difference?

____

&amp;nbsp;

First, let's briefly discuss the definitions of a Republic and a Democracy so that we can dive into the more juicy questions.

&amp;nbsp;
 
##Republic

A republic is a form of government in which power resides in the people, and the government is ruled by elected leaders and run according to law, rather than inherited or appointed. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic)

One of the most famous republics in history is the [Roman Republic](http://www.roman-empire.net/republic/rep-index.html) which began in 510BC after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy and lasted ~480 years. The Roman Republic had many elements which are still seen in modern republics today, such as:

* Constitution
* Consuls (Senators)
* Tribunes (Representatives)
* Separation of powers
* Checks and balances

[Source](http://www.ushistory.org/civ/6a.asp)

The separation of powers that exists in the US government was inspired by the Roman Republic, where power was divided between the consuls, the tribunes and the different assemblies of the people. This division of power was meant to protect minority rights and ensure that no one arm of the government became stronger than another. [Source](http://leidenlawblog.nl/articles/law-making-at-the-roman-imperial-court) It is also an important distinction between a republic and a democracy.

&amp;nbsp;

[Comparison between the US government and the Roman Republic.](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/rome-balance.asp)


&amp;nbsp;

## Democracy 

Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens are meant to participate equally – either directly or, through elected representatives, indirectly – in the proposal, development and establishment of the laws by which their society is run. In contrast with a republic, a democracy structurally favors majority opinion and typically has fewer protections for minorities. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy)

There are two basic forms of democratic governments:

* [Direct Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Direct), which is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives.

* [Representative Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Representative), which involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. 

[Athens](http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_democracy_overview?page=all) was one of the first known democracies. The city-state operated as a direct democracy for almost 200 years. The Athenian democracy saw nearly permanent turmoil in its existence, going from being subservient to nearby cities to a regional powerhouse back to subservience based on the outcome of poorly planned and executed wars. [Source](http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.html)

Aristotle, a Greek philosopher (considered one of the most influential thinkers of ancient times) lived in Athens and wrote in depth about political theory. He was very [critical of democracy as a form of government:](http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-26-1-plato-and-aristotle-on-tyranny-and-the-rule-of-law.html)

&gt; For in democracies where the laws are not supreme, demagogues spring up. . . . [T]his sort of democracy . . . [is] what tyranny is to other forms of monarchy. The spirit of both is the same, and they alike exercise a despotic rule over the better citizens. The decrees of the [demagogues] correspond to the edicts of the tyrant . . . . Such a democracy is fairly open to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme over all . . . .

Aristotle's writings about the dangers of democracies and the importance of constitutions and the rule of law had a profound impact on the Founding Fathers.

&amp;nbsp;

## What did the founders envision for the United States?

The founders based many of their ideas for the US system of government off of the writings of John Locke, another notable political philosopher. Locke developed many of his ideas off of the works of Aristotle and [Thomas Hobbes.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes) He is regarded as one of the most influential forces on the founding fathers and his political philosophy shaped the framework of the United States.  

In his [Second Treatise of Government](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdfs/locke1689a.pdf), Locke identified the basis of a legitimate government. According to Locke, the duty of that government is to protect the natural rights of the people, which includes life, liberty, and property. If the government should fail to protect these rights, its citizens would have the right to overthrow that government. This idea deeply influenced Thomas Jefferson as he drafted the Declaration of Independence. [Source](http://www.ushistory.org/gov/2.asp)

As a result, the founders envisioned the United States as a **[Constitutional Republic:](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_republic)**

&gt; a state in which the head of state and other officials are representatives of the people. They must govern to existing constitution. In a constitutional republic, executive, legislative, and judicial powers can be separated into distinct branches.

There is quite a bit of evidence that shows the founders did not want the US government to be a democracy, including:

* James Madison, in [Federalist Paper No. 10](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm), said that a pure democracy, "" there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual."" 
* At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Edmund Randolph said, "". . . that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy.""
* John Adams said, ""Remember, democracy never lasts long.  It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself.  There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide."" 

[Source](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/articles/fee/democracy.htm)

It is important to realize that the founders feared a system of government which would be dominated by majority rule. In a pure democracy, the majority rules and there is no such thing as a significant minority: there are no minority rights except civil rights (privileges) granted by a condescending majority. [Source](http://www.1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/repvsdem.htm)

The founders made sure that our Constitution set up a government that has numerous checks and balances to prevent majority rule. Each of the branches of government (executive, legislative, judicial) checks and balances another. There are also systems in place to ensure that the voices of smaller states are not drowned out by larger states (i.e. the House of Representatives vs the Senate, the Electoral College, etc).

&amp;nbsp;

##Where does the US government currently stand?

This is a pretty loaded question and one that is hotly debated. 

Some argue that the US is still a Constitutional Republic that has remained true to the founders' vision. While others believe it is a representative democracy. And yet others argue that the US is now an [oligarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy):

&gt; a government in which power effectively rests with a small number of people. These people could be distinguished by royalty, wealth, family ties, education, corporate, religious or military control. Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families who typically pass their influence from one generation to the next, but inheritance is not a necessary condition for the application of this term. 

[Article about study that found the US is an oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) ^*Note:* ^*the* ^*original* ^*study* ^*is* ^*no* ^*longer* ^*publicly* ^*available.*

The simple fact of the matter is that there is no right answer. The founders built the framework for the US government intending for it to operate as a Constitutional Republic. However, hundreds of years have passed and there have been political events and technological advances that the founders could not account for. America has transformed over that time and has tried to remain true to the Constitution, but how well have we done? And where do we really stand now?

personalfinance,"I'm 21, I had a goal of saving up $20k and am not sure what to do with my money right now.","Hi All,

Yes I have read the sidebar and the FAQs. For more in-depth background, I just turned 21 and have been wanting to save $20k for awhile now. I made it my goal and finally reached it last week with my most recent paycheck.

Currently, I'm in my last year of college. I have been blessed and been very fortunate to not have any debts or loans. For starter, I know that I plan to save $6k or so in a savings account as my emergency fund.

Now here's my main question: What should I do with the other $14k? As my income comes from my internship, I don't have any benefits from the company I work for and thus, my employer won't match my 401k or whatever else I have read about on the sidebar.

I've been considering opening up a different account that has a high interest rate to put the money in that account, but am not sure what the best account for that would be. I plan on going to graduate school eventually (maybe 3 years after working after undergrad), so it would be nice for the money to help pay that off.

Thank you for any future advice/recommendations!",finance,1410884281
personalfinance,"Question on Credit Cards and my specific situation (Yes, I read the FAQ)","I've been having a debate with myself for quite sometime and in interested in advice and feedback from here.

I have three credit cards right now that I would like to pay down. Two of these cards are Capital One cards, both with a $500 limit.  One has a rate of 14.99% and the other 14.15%.  The other card is a Citi card with a limit of 2000 and a rate of 29.99%  I am nearly at my limit for all three of these cards.

About 6 months ago I looked in to buying a house (after being fed up with renting and crappy landlords, felt like I was throwing money at nothing) and was told to be sure I didn't open any more cards.  My credit score at the time was fair and is still in the same area.  I'm sitting somewhere around 680.  This according to CreditKarma recently but when the score was pulled for mortgage info, CreditKarma wasn't far off from actual score and was actually slightly lower than my real score.

So, enough background, real question time.  Seeing as how I have put home buying on the back burner for now in order to get debt down and be more solid financial all around,  would applying for a new card and transferring balances to those cards be a good idea?  I don't have a problem making AT LEAST the minimum payment on those cards but the finance charges are what's killing me I believe.  This month alone I have been charged at least $50 in finance charges.  I understand opening a new card will affect my credit with the hard inquiry and age of credit lines but my thought was that it wouldn't hurt me so bad if I was waiting on the home buying and getting my balances/credit utilization under control.  Is that valid?

Also, if this is a plausible idea, does anyone have suggestions on which card I should choose for doing this? 

Like I said, I have read the FAQ and understand it but felt like this question was way more specific and needed more attention from what I was getting with that.  Thank you in advance for your help!",finance,1410888967
personalfinance,"Trying to rebuild and condense my finances, and I could use some help.","I'm a 23 year old female, who only started trying to get credit at about 21, and I seem to keep making mistakes so I am trying to figure out how to dig myself out of the ditch I made.

Right now, I have a lot of debt and not very much income. I'm trying to see if there is any way to pay down things faster and dig myself out of this trench I made. I've had a lot of stints of little-to-no employment in the past few years, and have finally landed a stable job I've worked my way up in from a flex to a part time (unfortunately there aren't any full time positions available in my department at this time, but I am always on the lookout). Most of my debt comes from having to use credit to sustain myself when I was jobless, though I also made some poor decisions on stuff I didn't really need but somehow seemed like a good idea at the time.

My current debts are:

~$7.5k on a car loan (2004 Nissan Sentra with a little over 70k miles now, literally my biggest regret I've ever made..)

$4.1k on a checking line of credit through my CU

$3.9k on a credit card through my CU

$904 student loan (deferred until Jan 2015, though I may ask for an increased deferral if I can)

$3.3k in past medical bills (in collections for almost a year now, untouched and unpaid)

My monthly bills are:

- Car insurance: $124 (I've only had my license for 3 years now, no bad driving/wrecks, just ""inexperienced and young"") fully covered, as my car is leased and they require it.

- Phone: $48 (Walmart's straight talk no contract phone plan.)

- Car payment: $230 minimum (I've only paid over on it twice, every other time has been min. since I fucking hate the car and don't plan on keeping it but can't sell it for anything near what I owe on it, and need it to get to/from work)

- Checking line of credit: ~$85

- Credit card: ~$85

I also am getting EBT benefits to help with food cost, although those should be running out soon, as I may not qualify for the next update. Currently I get $115/month from that, though, so it helps for now.

I work retail 20+ hours a week, usually between 20-25 at $10/hr before tax. My hours should be picking up the next couple months, since we are going into the holiday season, so I am trying to use that extra money wisely.

I applied for the credit card not thinking I would get such a high limit (as I have that medical bill in collections), but with it being $4k I had just enough to balance transfer over my other two credit cards (a $800 limit and a $3k limit) where the interest rates were eating away anything I put onto them. I still have those cards, sitting at $0 balance, as well as my maxed out CC, in my dresser drawer. My goal of balance transferring, even though it would max out my new one, was to consolidate my bills by having one payment a month instead of 2 (3 if I ever touched my new one for any reason). It also cut my monthly payments down, as my 3k one I was paying $100/month (it didn't have a minimum, so I paid 100 or w/e I could afford), and my $800 one sat at $35 for a year, but once the 0% interest bonus expired, it kept going up and up, ending up at $65+/month before I transferred the balance. Most of those two cards were racked up when I was in-between jobs, or not making enough when I had one. Then I had a bunch of medical bills due to an emergency room visit (I paid a few of the random ""physician's fee"", ""2AM fee"" ""give us all your money"" fees, but I didn't know you could negotiate bills or payment plans, and when they sent me a $3k bill telling me to pay in full immediately after already paying close to $1k in other crap fees and borrowing from family, I just ignored it and let them send it to collections, because no way in hell am I able to pay $3k+ (it's about 3.2k now, after collection's interest or w/e. Been in collections for almost a year now, untouched) when I've only made about $12k gross each year I've worked. I've pretty much given up on that bill, which is probably not the best thing to do but since it's already in collections and already fucked my credit, I don't know what else to do with it. I hear you can settle old collections for a fraction of the actual bill, but i have no idea how to do that?

My paychecks after tax, are usually around $400-500, and paying the minimum on everything I owe, technically I should be able to save some money at the end of the check, yet there always seems to be some random expense that drains what little cash I had left over before next payday, and I am stuck in this never-ending loop of making poor wages with not enough hours, no options for better-paying jobs, and barely keeping afloat, god forbid I visit my parents from time to time and have to fill up my gas tank more than once a paycheck...

So, is there anything I can be doing that I am not seeing to try and pay down my debts sooner?

I'm trying to control my own debts, although I am married and he has his own debts too... I'm hoping to make something of an impact on mine before bringing up a plan to control his too, as he makes so much more money than I do and I know we could save so much more with his help in curbing his spending too...",finance,1410889427

personalfinance,"Paid off $46,500 in Student Loans in 2 Years","We finally paid off the last of my husbands major Student Loans, it feels amazing and surreal at the same time.


Background: before we accepted the reality of our loans, we were struggling. His monthly payments were over $950 a month (not including my student loan payment). He didn’t have a co-signer so his interest rates were atrocious. We realized constantly putting the loans in and out of forbearance to get by was not sustainable. Staring down the barrel of 25 years of a thousand dollar payment was insane, not to mention paying well into the six figures for all the interest on the loans if we didn’t do something.


We accepted no one was going to help us but ourselves; not our lender, not the government, not “student loan forgiveness”, not some whimsical inheritance. We buckled down, we created a budget, and my husband got a second job.


During 2013/2014 we paid off:

* $15,600 @ 12%
* $10,700 @ 10.75%
* $5,300	@ 8%
* $5,800	@ 6.8%

Income - wife:

Depends on commission but around $60K. On average $1.5K take home every two weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

Savings:

$36K in a savings account (0.5% - moving to Ally soon)

Plus a few grand kicking around in checking

Usually able to add a couple of grand to savings every year - mostly money from the bonus.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Car loans:

&amp;nbsp;

I have all my stuff in Mint.

&amp;nbsp;

Goals:

1. Buy a house in 5 years. I want a yard and a garage. Decent houses in our area are $500K-$700K.
Sell both townhouses. Want to get rid of the rental sooner - in a year or two.

2. Retirement:
I understand the idea of early retirement/financial independence but personally I would be miserable without a job. I like my work, I'm good at it and I'm not good at anything else. Tried having a startup and hated it. Corporate culture and me are made for each other :) So, I'm looking forward to working into my 60s or until they don't need me anymore. I would like to have enough saved for retirement for us to live comfortably.

3. Kids' education:
Ideally I would love to be able to pay for their school in full. Not sure this is in the cards but I'd like to come as close as possible to this goal.

&amp;nbsp;

Questions:

1. Overall analysis/advice? Anything egregious going on that I'm not catching up on?

2. How realistic is the goal to get a house in 5 years? Am I on the right path or do I need to make changes?

3. How does the retirement situation look? Anything obvious that I'm missing?

*Let's assume that you're in the military, financially sound, no debt, no CC ballance carried over etc, with $5000 emergency fund.   

*Let's also assume that you have a credit card (couple of them) with 0% APR till December 2015 with 5% cash-back on food/gas which are (besides rent) your major expences (pre-paid phone cards being bought at grocery store).  


What would PF do:  


*1) put $5000 straight towards certificate, charge everything on the card, keep paying the card and replenish emergency fund, collect 5% from CD and 5% cash back from CC  

*2) save emergency fund and ""invest"" into CD and charge everything on the card, collect 5% from CD &amp; 5% cash-back  

*3) save emergency fund, pay off CC each month, invest left-overs into CD  

Obviously I'm opting for option 1 (I feel very stable financially and willing to take 5% + 5% - taxes). My SO isn't so sure about my ""great"" idea.",finance,1410901083
personalfinance,Do I pay off student loan debt or save for future?,"Here's my situation:


Student loan debt = $52k 

Loan 1 = $7k @ 5.1%

Loan 2 = $31k @ 3.7%

Loan 3 = $14K @ 2.7%


The student loans are my only debt.  In terms of assets, I have a 6-month emergency fund, a Roth 401K that I am getting the max company match on, and an additional $15K or so in stocks.  I am in my late 20s and have a good paying job.



I got my student loans down from ~$100k to where they are now by paying off the highest interest loans first.  My original plan is to make minimum payments on the rest of my student loans while I save for upcoming life events (engagement ring, wedding, house, car, etc.).  But now, I am thinking I will pay off the $7K loan first, then continue with the minimum payments on the other two.  I want to pay all of the loans off, but I'm afraid that I will have to push my entire life back a few years(further than I already have) to do that. Either that, or I pay off these loans just to take out new loans for a wedding/house/car/etc.



My question: At the interest rates that I have on my current student loans, does it make sense to make minimum payments so I can save for big expenses?  I'm sure there are other people in similar situations, just looking for some feedback.",finance,1410901265
personalfinance,Would an assumable FHA loan be more attractive for selling 5-8yrs from now?,"I am preparing to purchase a home.


My main reasons for this are:

 - I'm tired of sharing walls with noisy neighbors.

 - I want to be able to have a back yard and a large-breed dog

 - I'm sick and tired of moving every 2 years when they try to jack up my rent $100 each month.

 - Interest rates are as low as I think they'll ever be in my lifetime.

 - I want to build equity in something and (eventually) not have a mortgage/rent payment, just taxes.


With that in mind, I'm looking at houses around the $150-175k range.


My financial situation:

I make ~$70k/year and my only debt is $40k in student loans which are current. For the past year I have been paying $75 more each month to help pay these down.

My credit score is only ~660 due to me never using credit cards (neither a borrower or a lender be...) and losing a dispute with my insurance company 6 years ago about who should pay a $4k cancer bill which went to collections during the dispute. It has since been paid in full. I have no outstanding collections/charge offs/settlements on my report. I'm hoping that the upcoming FICO9 changes will open the door a bit this autumn, even if it isn't what the mortgage companies will use for their final determination.

I have $15k saved up for a down payment for whatever home I purchase. I also have access to generous a $25k gift from my parents towards my first home purchase, but would prefer to not use due to potential family issues. I'm considering an FHA loan since they are assumable. I feel that with rates as low as they are now, having an assumable low-interest loan will make my property marginally more attractive to prospective buyers 5- 8 years down the road when rates will be higher.

personalfinance,"CC and loan debt. Looking for help on understanding a loan I just took, and where my extra money should be going.","**tl;dr** I was in desperate need of some money and took out a loan through the first website that I found. Now that I'm more stable and in a position to pay off my loans, I'd like to understand the best way to go about this.

******Any and all advice would be appreciated!******

---

**Long version**: 

I have recently figured out my shit and budgeted to the point where I have about $800 to spare per month. I have about $500 in my savings for emergency, and another $500 in the checking account. The CC debts I have are:

* CC1: $1,700 with 3% interest until May 2015, then it goes up to ~22%
* CC2: $6,700 with 0% interest until Sept 2015, then it goes up to ~18% 
* Loan: ~$14,000 with 13.35%/16.98% APR (please see below for details)

I know that I'll be unable to pay this off before my interest rates go up, but I'd like to know where I should be putting my money in the mean time. I've read /r/personalfinance/'s stance, and I understand the difference between the snowball and avalanche payment methods, but I don't know which one would be best for me. I also know that you guys recommend an emergency fund. Should I be putting it there first?

Before anyone asks:

* Yes, I have budgeted food to the best of my ability
* Yes, I am living on the bare minimum in terms of being frugal

**Loan Details**: 

I needed to take out a loan for an emergency, and found one quick. Details of the loan are as follows:

* **Terms**: $15,000 / 36-month
* **Interest Rate**: 13.35% / 16.98% APR &lt;---- this is where I'm confused
* **Original Requested Amount**: $15,000
* **Sum of remaining payments**: $16,762.05
* **Pay-off Amount**: $14,120.72
* **Amount paid to date**: $1,523.85 (8.33%)

When I took out the loan, I thought the interest rate would be 13.35%, but now I'm seeing this 16.98% APR number, and I'm sort of freaking out. I've tried googling ""APR vs Interest"" but I still don't understand it.

Also, the company that I took the loan from (LendingClub) allows you to pay off your debt early with no penalty. Should I do this?",finance,1410903926

personalfinance,Pay Car Loan vs. Roth IRA,"Hello!

I purchased a new car back in January this year and also opened up a Roth IRA around the same time. I'm trying to determine what best to do with my money every month or if I've been doing it wrong.

**Car Loan**

* **Current Principal Balance:** $14,900
* **Interest Rate:** 5.09%
* **Min. Monthly Payment:** $300
* **Loan Term:** 72 months

**Roth IRA**

* **Current Balance:** $6,400
* **Invested In:** Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund (VFFVX)
* **Fund Performance:** http://i.imgur.com/WMoDTWm.jpg
* **2014 Contributions:** $2,586.25 of $5,500 yearly max

Since January I've been paying $500 a month towards my car loan and I'm now contributing $416.25 per month towards my Roth IRA to meet the $5,500 max in April. 

I'm wondering if I should continue paying more than the minimum towards my car loan or not considering the VFFVX fund has had a higher rate of return than 5.09%. Also, would it make sense to refinance the car loan for a lower interest rate? I opened the loan when I had a pretty thin credit history. I've since improved my credit and my fako score is around 750.

personalfinance,What to do with Excess Student Loan Money,"I have $13,000 in federal subsidized student loans and will be graduating in December.
Although I have 10k+ in loans, $4,500 or so is excess that is currently sitting in a savings account earning 0.95%. 
I will need to start paying these back in June and have enough to pay off all but $3,000 of them but I bet there are better options where I could stash the money to earn more than the 3.4% interest that each will be accruing during repayment.
When the time comes to repay the loans, should I just pay off all that I can and leave only a $3000 balance to chip away at or should I put the money somewhere else that earns more than 3.4% while only paying the minimum each month?",finance,1410916499
personalfinance,"Looking to finance a new car, suggestions?","So I am thinking of buying a new car sometime later this year or early next. I am a 21 year old 3rd year commuting college student who is still living with the parents. Several years ago I was fortunate enough to inherit my grandmother's car when she passed away. It's a very nice car, low mileage, excellent condition, and I take great care of it. However I am a bit of a car guy and I want a fun, manual transmission car that gets better fuel economy and is more practical that can fit my 120 lb doberman in the back :). Looking at getting a new VW Golf GTI, which looks like it will be around $28,000 OTD (After taxes, fees, etc). Would be either trading in or selling privately my current car which is worth around $12,000 trade in, or $14,000 if I sell it privately. I work 2 part time jobs while attending school full time, and I'd say I could bring in anywhere from 600-1000 dollars a month after taxes depending on how much I work (second job pays extremely well but I only work that job every other Saturday) I currently have about $11,000 that I have managed to save over the last year or so (took a gap year and just worked). What I am wondering, is if I should wait a little longer, save more, and pay the car off in full, with no payments, but also draining my savings account down to zero (My only other expenses would be cell phone, car insurance, other minor food expenses, I'm a huge tight wad with my money, except when it comes to my car...) OR should I put down about $20,000 dollars on the car and finance about $8000 leaving me with still quite a large savings account, but with a monthly payment of around $150 dollars (I think?) for a 60 month loan. I could then use my savings to help me pay my bills if I need to, but i'd be losing money do to interest over the long run. My Insurance on this car, due to it being new, and my gender and age (no tickets or accidents at all yet) Would be around 1000-1500 per year. (again, rough estimate, I need to get some quotes) I think option #2 is the better bet all around, yes I have a small car payment, and lose money in interest, but my old fashioned parents who like to buy everything with cash tell me to just save more. But then i'll have nothing left in the bank. Before I forget, I got a credit card about 8 months ago, have been using it for gas and food and such, pay it off every month in full as soon as I can, trying to build a credit score. Will I get a horrible interest rate if I go route #2 being a credit newb? 

And yes I know buying a new car when I have a perfectly good one is an irrational financial decision. But I am passionate about cars. I'm not like the majority of people my age who waste all their money as soon as they get it on clothes or alcohol or w/e :)

personalfinance,IRA thru credit union?,"Not having the luxery of employer-matched retirement saving, I'm looking at opening up an IRA shortly, and I see there's plenty of good comments in this sub about organizations such as Vanguard, Charles Schwab, etc. Without actually applying for one, it appears I cannot view much information about their specific services and rates.

But it also happens that my credit union offers IRAs as well. In general, I like and trust my credit union and would prefer to do business with them -- but only if it makes more financial sense, like better rates or protection or lower fees.

So what should I looks for? I can't get too many details on the credit union's IRA, but unlike the others, *do* have their interest rates They rise over time and are too numerous to list simply.

Worth noting that if I am being honest, I don't fully understand exactly what an IRA is, though of course I intend to remedy this, *and thoroughly*, before I invest in one.

Full CSI now, could there be something in the unix system, network, firewall logs or something? No way, using tails I don't have root access to view any logs. I doubt tails would save many logs anyway.

I'm running out of ideas. Firefox again, maybe there are temporary files? I look around and find the internal `about:cache` page. Somewhere in the few hundres entries I find a cached document with the url containing the id. I think it was a redirect to the login page after creating the wallet.

I guess I was really lucky to still find it in the cache. I'm not sure if there would have been any other way to recover the id. I need a drink now.",cryptocurrency,1410932122

I then just avoided the issue for years. Buying cars at high interest rates, rent to own furniture, payday loans, fingerhut, an hsbc credit card with 250.00 limit that I maxed out within two days of receiving it andnever paid, overdrawing on checking account purposely just because I wanted money to buy something. Which often times was things like gas, groceries, car payment etc. It was just an endless cycle. I even filed bankruptcy at one point and my debts weren't even that high. Less than 15 thousand at the time..so, about 2 years ago I started really paying attention to finances. I quit overdrawing on checking account, I quit eating out so much, I resisted the urge to go to the store and buy things I didn't really need. Paid off my car. Started putting money into 401k at work. Moved myself and my child out of my ghetto , roach infested apartments into something nicer and things were going well. I finally decided to face the music and pull my credit report. I had a score of 540 and around 7 negative things from the credit card to medical bills. I was tired of bad credit. I researched and saw via an online message board that a good way to repair bad credit was to open a credit line, use it and pay the bill off every month but carry over a 5 to 10 dollar balance. I applied for an amazon card. Got denied. A couple months later applied for a capitol one card and surprisingly got approved for 300.00 limit. I used the card for gas and a couple things that auto pay like netflix and cell phone bill. I paid balance every month and carried over small amount 5 to 10 dollars. I was told that after 5 months of on time payments and as long as I used the card at least once a month I would get an automatic credit line increase and I expected it to maybe go up to around 750... it went up to 3 thousand...

I am in fear of losing my job, and I need some advice on how I can keep a part time or full time job with having a child who needs attention often and misses school. 

Should I look for a job to do from home (I would LOVE that) or should I invest in an emergency sitter? I've tried the sitter thing and it's just unreliable.

My boyfriend has back problems and I also have to tend to him too. His job is very reliable however and they are clearly investing in him. 

What's your opinion on how I can work from home or maybe acquire a part time/full time job while having a back up sitter? How can I get a sitter to come on the spot too? Sometimes I only find out my son is sick when he wakes up in the morning with a fever. 

Money isn't as important as my sanity and trust me, I HATE my job. How can I be a reliable care taker of my son while pulling in $1,000 or more a month?

personalfinance,How much % do you guys tend to down payment on a car?,"I was just talking to my sister in law and she likes to actually save up 50% of the down payment before getting a car. She saved up 30 G's before buying her fully loaded $50k Lexus RX 450H. Takes a lot of pressure off monthly payments especially if I wanted a fully loaded BMW 3 series or something or getting a m3 for my dad she said. Just curious to see what you guys save. She can see that my family has a habit of spending over saving, and she's recommending that I break that curse in my family lol. Buying cars with 20-25% down is the norm for my family, along with fancy up-to-date Apple products.

Btw, I was recently looking at a fully loaded BMW 328d online just to see how much it costs, and it is about 54k. In the state of Georgia, there is no more ad valorem tax, but there is a one time 7% or 6.5% sales tax essentially, so that brings it to about 57k. I did a calculation on how much monthly payments would be after a 25% down payment, bringing it to about 43k. In a hypothetical situation where interest rate was 2.4%, a 3 year loan had a $1258 monthly payment, and a 5 year loan had like a $761 monthly payment. In a situation where interest rates are low, do you guys think a 5 year loan would always be better? I did the math and you save about $1k in interest if you do the 3 year loan, which seems pretty measly, but maybe I am looking at it the wrong way.

Also curious to see if you guys tend to do 3 or 5 year loans on cars, and of course i know there are some people who do 100% down payment, as they said interest is essentially a tax on impatience, which is true hehe.

-EDIT- I always thought that if interest rates are low enough, then why not? Time value of money stuff going on in my head from finance class. I just dont know what the defiinition of ""when interest rates are low enough"" are for cars. Btw I am still in college and have never had a major purchase or had to do major stuff with my money so I am curious to see what people do, and what the ""right"" thing to do is. The smart move financially.

-EDIT- So I think what I have learned from all this discussion is that if you cannot afford a 3 year car loan comfortably, there is no way you should stretch it out to 5 year car loans, as looking at the monthly payments you make on a car is incredibly misleading, whereas I should focus on the total value of the car, and how much it will cost to maintain it. 50% down payment seems to be a good rule of thumb, and if interest rates are low enough, I can always just down pay as little as possible and use that 50% down payment I saved up to pay for it monthly, or to invest in other things that can generate a higher return than 2% or however low my car interest rate is.

-EDIT- A guy on one of my other reddit posts said ""I always pay 100% down. I make monthly payments to MYSELF for the next car I get"". I like that way of thinking.

-EDIT- Please use downvote correctly. It's not a ""disagree"" button it's a ""you're not contributing to the discussion"" button. I'm here to learn.

-EDIT- by the way I want to thank everyone for putting their opinions on here. It ranges from 100% down payment to 25%. It's good to have all these diverse opinions because I can take whatever I like and what makes sense to me and incorporate it into my mindset. And I imagine it will only continue to change as I get older.

personalfinance,Credit cards for low credit scores without hostile contracts,"First of all thank you for your time. I'm sure there are a ton of these thread posted here everyday. I've been reading up here for the past hour and honestly my head is spinning. Here's my situation. 


I have a 537 FICO score. This is from my Wells Fargo account dept. It has some type of overdraft protection thing that has an $1000 limit and without really looking into it further I charged bar tabs for an  entire summer and then the interest kicked in when I didn't keep up with the min payments and now it's at over $1000. Over a year later I'm finally getting a hold on the situation. They removed some of the fees and I've been paying $150 a month the last 2 months so it will be gone soon. This is the only line of credit on my report. 


In the mean time, however, I am trying to try to open new lines of credit so that when my derogatory item is paid off I have new positive ones to counter it. Before I began my research I tried applying for all the highly recommended credit cards with 0% interest for a year and all that in the hopes that I would be able to transfer this dept and immediately get my credit up. But now I've realized how hard it is to get one of these and that I've probably hurt my score by applying for so many (apparently it's a 'hard inquiry' which is bad). 


Now I've read that my best bet is to save up $500 dollars and get a secured card. The only problem is that with my current bills it would take at least 2 months of saving and spending absolutely nothing but bills to save that amount. 


**Basically, Here's what I'm looking for:**
I've heard there's credit card companies that will take people like me. They have crazy interest rates and very low max amounts but that's fine. All that I'm looking for is something to charge my gas for my car on and then pay it off before the grace period expires. What I scared off is hidden fees and stuff like that. I've read about cards that hit with all types of service and handling and random fees. I can't afford to pay any type of fee. Can anyone recommend a trust worthy card? 



Extra Info: The reason I am trying to get this resolved as soon as possible is I need to get my car signed over to my name. When I got it my girlfriend was going to cosign it. They ended up not being able to make that deal go through so they just straight up put it in her name. I've been diligently making payments every week on it for almost a year and all the credit score is going to her instead of me. Things are kinda rocky in the relationship right now I think we might split in December when the lease on our apartment is over. I need to have this car in my name by then so that I can make decisions without any strings attached. 


I read that it is smart to have a credit card in each of the 4 major companies and to just use it once a quarter to keep it active. This is my goal.",finance,1410971312
personalfinance,Term Life Insurance for Student Loans?,"My wife an I (early 30s) live in Los Angeles, California. We don't have a mortgage and we have no kids. However, together we have a student loan debt of about 130k ($89k Federal and $42k Private) from before we were married. Because my wife is a teacher, we are planning on using Loan Forgiveness for the federal loans. We are planning on (hopefully) getting a house and having kids within the next few years. We help support my in-laws with aproximately $500 each month and our montly rent is about $1250. Our annual household income is about $100k.

My question is whether or not it is worth it for us to get term life insurance. I know most people say it doesn't matter if you don't have kids or a mortgage, however with the student loans, I'm worried what will happen to my wife if something were to happen to me. Also, right now the in-laws are basically like our dependants. Is this a good idea? Should we **both** be getting life insurance?

personalfinance,Advice on paying off student loans,"Hello, I'm sure you guys get a ton if these posts, but I'm looking for a little advice. First, some details. I have two student loans in repayment:

$6,782 - 6.8% interest
$18,181 - 6.8% interest

The scheduled payments over a 10 year period are $85.71 and $223.61 respectively. I am currently paying $185.71 into the smaller of the two loans to pay it off faster. My wife and I make $60k+ each per year, so we live very comfortably. We each contribute 7% of our paychecks to retirement accounts and put 10% of each paycheck into a simple savings account (working on putting aside 6 months expenses).

Now, my questions. First, I've been looking to refinance student loans recently and I think I can get my interest rate down to 5.125% on both loans through SoFi. Is this the best I can do, or do you think I can go lower elsewhere? I just got a raise at work that will equate to about an extra $250 per month. Since we already live the life we want I'm trying to figure out where to put this. Right off the bat I would say put it towards the student loans, but if I can refinance low enough I should invest or put it in savings, right?

Any advice or guidance you can offer would be appreciated.",finance,1410973149

Right now, I'm a college student, and I work as a nanny. I make really great money for someone in college, but I have no credit. I'm starting to save up for the down payment (I have $500 so far from this month). I want to start looking at cars now so I can get an idea of what I want and what I can afford. I expect to spend between $4000 and $7000 on the car, depending on when I get it and how much time I've had to save. My current car is pretty old, but I'll keep driving it until either it klunks out or till June, when my brother gets his license. Anyway, what I'm hoping is that someone could give me an idea of what my interest rate would be. I don't expect an exact number, but I want to know what it is so I can estimate my monthly payment. Right now, I make $1800/month, have no credit, and $5000 in student loans. I hope to have  at least $2000 saved up before I buy the car, but I'd like to keep $500 of that as a safety net. If I can hold of getting the car for a few months, I also plan on getting a credit card and paying it all off right away to build credit,

Sorry that's so loquacious. 
Anyway, here's the facts:
-No credit rate
-$1800/month income
-Parents can cosign, and as a wild guess, I'd say their credit rate is 600.

personalfinance,Are there any negative aspects to consider when taking out a small subsidized student loan that I pay back before graduation?,"In short I'm a veteran going to school on my GI Bill. I've got 3-4 months worth of living expenses in a savings account and have zero debt to my name and am currently unemployed, receiving my GI bill monthly stipend of 1400 as well as having 4000 in my checking account.

The CC I'm going to says I qualify for a 4500 federal subsidized loan.

Normally I wouldn't be interested in it as I really have no need, but personal issues have led me to consider it. Basically for the past two years I've been living near my college with my girlfriend, so I just bike to campus.

We're in the process of breaking up and I need to find my own place. I found one I love nearby, with affordable rent (675 for a 2br.

The issue is that they require a statement showing you make 2.5x the rent amount to rent with them. I explained that I'm unemployed but have steady income via the GI bill (Showing bank statements from the previous year I used it which shows I could very easily make rent payments on time, plus land lord letters saying I've never been late).

They said they want me to pay 3-4 months of rent up front to allow me to rent.

Now here's the question. I could do this and not dip into savings or be left destitute in my checking account. However, I'm also looking into buying a cheap (3kish) car from a friend.

What I'd like to know is if I take this 4500 subsidized loan just as a piece of mind to have in my account, and pay it back before I graduate, are there any downsides to this plan I'm not seeing?

From what I'm understanding, I'd just have to pay the 4500 + 47 loan fee as it is a subsidized loan so the government is paying the interest until 6 months after graduation.

Is it ok to take a loan like this just as a backup emergency fund (Since I do have one I don't want to be forced to dip into) and then pay it off before graduation?",finance,1410976076

personalfinance,for the love of god - where's the easy button when it comes to choosing your first credit card?,"upon deciding that i needed to put on my big girl pants and get a credit card, i recently utilized my employer's financial support with hopes of narrowing the search, but, beyond the basics [e.g. avoiding cards with annual fees &amp; high interest rates / late fees] they were unable to provide what i seek, which is actual recommendations - chase freedom, capital one, etc. 

one thing that did come from the conversation was the prospect of joining a credit union, which i hadn't considered. 

while i've heard that being denied for a card doesn't directly hurt your credit score, i am curious as to how good my chances are to qualify. because this would be my first card, i don't have credit to begin with, and the only debt i'm currently managing is monthly student loan payments. my intention is simply to build credit. it may be everyone's famous last words, but i'm responsible with my money and don't plan to carry over monthly balances.

personalfinance,How can I come up with a down payment for a house?,"Here is my situation, and I am absolutely confounded how to come up with the money to buy a house.

1.  I am 44.  I am separated, about to become legally divorced.  The financial terms of the split are not set yet.  She and I get along very well, so we are trying to figure out how to do things equitably (stop laughing).  

2.  We own a home with a market value of about $550k, with a mortgage hovering around $430k.  I do not want her to have to move, because the kids grew up there, it is a stable place for them, and I want them to continue having that stability.  So selling the house is not an option as a source of a down payment.  In any event, the equity of ~$100k would be split, presumably.  

3.  We have about $30,000 in our checking and savings (not including a kids' savings account of 15k we are not touching).  That is going to be split, so I'm looking at $15k cash on hand.  

4.  As a government attorney, I have a TSP (like a 401(k)) with ~$110k in it.  I could borrow up to $50k off that, but that is screwing with my retirement, and I also have to pay any amounts back in 15 years.  But until it is paid back, that money earns no interest.  So that appears to be folly.  Same with my AmericanFund IRA, which has about $230k in it.  

5.  I'm looking to get a house a house that is about $200k (relatively moderate for Baltimore for a two-bedroom row house that doesn't need renovations).  I'd like to avoid PMI, so I'd need $40k.  Tall order with no money saved.  Being able to save is difficult, apart from what I am putting into my federal retirement and TSP, which I max out each year.  

Any thoughts on how I could come up with the down payment?  Or am I doomed to rent until the kids move out in a few years and the house is sold and we split the assets?",finance,1410977920

personalfinance,Mortgage debt settlement for expat?,"I purchased a house 12 years ago for $220k.   I had two mortgages.  One was $170k and another was $35k.  I lived in the home for a number of years.  I was then transferred by my company out of the country.

At the time of the transfer, the home value was below $200k and I decided to rent it out.  I hired a property manager and left the country.   A few months later, this property manager closed up shop and moved to another state, so I was left managing the property.

Two years ago, the tenant informed me he was terminally ill, but didn't plan to move out and would keep paying. His family then moved him out in the middle of the night after not paying rent and left the place trashed.  I did not find out for months.

I paid the mortgage myself for a number of months while I tried to save up enough cash to renovate the house to a livable condition, but I lost my job during that period, so I was forced to default on the mortgage.   According to the bank, the home was only worth about $165k at this point.

I immediately approached them to see if I could do a short sale, which they told me was unlikely to be approved because of the very low valuation on the home and the two mortgages. 

We began the process of a deed-in-lieu.  I called their offices a total of 51 times over the following 8 months (I kept notes).  I was often met with ""I'm sorry, we don't have your name in the system"" or ""your file has been sent to a third party processor who will contact you soon"".  

I eventually escalated to the bank's management and after threatening them with legal proceedings, I finally got some action on it.  However, at this point, it turned out to be too late, as they pushed through the foreclosure auction right under the deadline for the deed-in-lieu.

The foreclosure sale paid off the first mortgage in full, but left the second mortgage entirely unpaid, for a total of $35,000.

* My income when I bought the house in 2004 was $70k 
* in 2011 was about $100,000/yr.  
* My income in 2013 was about $20,000.  
* My income now is approximately $130,000/yr.  -- Due to the high cost of the city I live in (due to work obligations), and an unemployed (health reasons) spouse, I don't have a ton left over each month, but I have set aside $1,500/mo for debt payments.


Now, I am left with a dillemma. 

* First, I plan to remain in this foreign country.  The credit issues back in the US do not affect my local credit at all.

* Second, I now have a job with a higher income than I have ever had in the past, but little liquid savings (this is now growing rapidly). I do not have a substantial net worth, other than a few thousand in a retirement fund and owning a car and some other assets outright.

* I have a moderate (but very under control) amount of debt from a period of being unemployed, and from my spouse's medical issues.  

* I am working very hard to avoid connecting my financial profile in the US with my current country.  At least one of the banks in the US is a subsidiary of my international bank, and at this point, they have not connected the profiles of my US and international accounts.  I would like very much if they did not do that (although, obviously, I only want to do this in a legally permissible way).  In this regard, I have avoided sending them my local address and communicate using a US-based Post Office Box.

* I could borrow up to $10,000 if it would help.  

My question is:

**Given this $35,000 mortgage debt, what are my settlement options?**  Am I doomed to pay off the remaining 18 years of the mortgage?  Is it likely they would accept a settlement of a lump-sum now, especially if I emphasize that I am overseas and do not particularly care about my credit rating in the US?

I would like to try to settle this debt, especially in light of a remote chance that the final parts of my formal immigration status to my new country could be derailed, if it were shown I was ""willfully"" avoiding debts by moving.

I have considered offering them something like $8,000 lump-sum to settle the debt.  Is it plausible they would accept this, especially in light of my living out of the country?

With an extremely low interest rate (I think it's 3.25%), is it even practical to accelerate the payments, or should I just be resigned to sending them $280/mo for the next 18 years and sink my money into retirement funds and other things?

Is there a chance they will come after me in court and attempt to screw up my credit with my local country?

Is there a chance they will be able to get some sort of legal enforcement?  Is it illegal to not pay a debt?   

So many questions....  Thanks for your time.

I also rent-to-own a TV and DVD player, which I pay $203 a month for 12 months. I'm only 2 months in.

My other bills are general bills.

$271 for a car loan
$203 for technically unnecessary luxuries
$181 for car insurance
$126 for cable and Internet (Comcast is the only thing available in my area)
$100 give or take for electric
$30 for water

Today, my Jeep went ""kaput!"" My boyfriend used his AAA to have it towed to our apartment and there it sits. 

I start a new job this Friday. It's a great opportunity and the first full-time employment I'll have had in 8 years (I graduated college 4 years ago). At the very least, I'll finally have a steady income once I transition to full-time; I will be part-time while I finish out my time at my current job. At any rate, I'll be working 5 days a week.

I have a credit score in the ""poor"" range, up from the very poor it's been sitting at for years. I've had some old bad stuff fall off and I've been working on better habits. I have no savings and will have little, if any, left over from my next paycheck.

I currently have monthly bills that total $815 and anticipate a monthly income of $1390 (after accounting for anticipated taxes, a 10% to savings and an estimated health insurance premium). This leaves me with an anticipated $575 leftover a month. A month after I am done at my current job, I will be able to pull out my accumulated retirement savings which will total around $1,900 but will be taxed and penalized if I don't put it straight into another retirement account. I should also be able to get a good few hundred dollars from junking my broken Jeep. Here are my two options as I see them:

1. Drive boyfriend to work tomorrow in his car. Go out (after researching tonight) to a dealership that works with poor credit and has used cars in my price range. I would be looking to spend about $150 a month on a car payment and this would also add to my car insurance costs.

1. Boyfriend is against making payments on anything: house, land, car, credit card, etc... He is willing to share his car with me. We live together and work relatively close together as well. Or, we will be when I am at my new job. Presumably we would do this until one or the other of us saves up and finds a cheap car to buy from a private seller. This would be a car that costs $1,000 to $3,000. It would be mine (or his) outright, not add to car insurance costs but would also likely last only a year or 3.

I can see upsides and downsides to both options. I'd love to build my credit through a car loan and have the immediate freedom that I find in having my own car; I don't know if I will be approved at all, let alone the interest rate I will get etc... Also, it's a car payment - ugh. On the other hand, owning a car outright would be very nice; I don't want to keep buying near-death cars that have things going wrong all the time. Presumably that is what I will get from a dealership as well, I'd just have a payment along with the stress.

So there you have it, Personal Finance. Opinions? Thoughts? Advice? Anecdotes? Life lessons?

 Also, I would like to get my MBA in the near future.  I was debating getting the degree online from UMASS over the course of 2 years ($32,175), or Temple University over the course of 4 years ($59,097).  

With the assistance of my current job, the final costs out of my pocket would be:

* UMASS - $12,175
* TU - $19,097

I believe the reason the consulting firm doesn't offer graduate school assistance is because the firm is a high demand company and excellent resume builder.

This is my first car I've financed myself (had an old car for 5-6 yrs before I wrecked it). Didn't need a cosigner or anything. The car is around 18k and monthly payments are $310, down payment was kind of crummy. Only 2k, whatever insurance gave me for my previous car. And I believe the interest rate is around... 5.79%? My current bank has told me if I make on time payments (edit: for a year) they can get me a lower interest rate (claiming around 2-3%) if I refinance with them. 

Now, I don't have really much trouble paying this every month. But, only having a part time job, it'll be nice to have some extra cash for me to set up an emergency fund. 

My status per month:  
Currently living at home. No rent.  
Car insurance around $100, full coverage  
Phone bill $70  
Gas around $150-200 (I commute to college 2 times a week)  
I have made huge mistakes in my past and had a big medical issue so I have two credit cards that are maxed out, both capped at $1,000

Usually after each paycheck I've got like $150 left after paying all my bills. This is *not* including gas. So basically I'm left with like, ~$50 in extra spending. Which. Sucks.

personalfinance,Paying off my girlfriends dept.,"So PF, I have a dilemma. I (26M) have been dating a girl (24F) for roughly four years now and we have been living together for two. The big problem is that she is terrible with money, and I mean terrible.


Background:

She has a three year old son, who isn't mine. (She didn't cheat, she was pregnant when I met her.)

She has 3,000 in Medical Debt from when she was 18.

She has 3 maxed Credit Cards a 500$, 300$ and 200$ with interest rates ranging from 7.99% (the 500$) to 18.99% (the 200$ one). However she hasn't made a payment in quite some time so with late fee's and everything it totals out to be around 1300$ in debt.

She just had the a joint bank account go delinquent for being negative, this went to collections and she owes them 200$.

Plus a student loan out for 1500$ that she has to start making payments for at the end of the year.

So all in all she is about 6000$ in debt with no income besides mine coming in.

I work from 9-7 Saturday through Wednesday and go to school either during the nights or on my two days off. (This is just background as to why I don't help watch Jared her kid.) Even if she got a great job with no college degree (around 10-12$ an hour) drop in daycare runs 8$ an hour around us. (There is one that is subsidized for low-income but after she checked it out, she just flat out refused because she thought it was terrible.) 

I thought about having her file for Bankruptcy because she isn't bringing in any income and we are scraping by as is. She said I could try taking out a loan to pay off her bills in hopes that it would be a more manageable payments than all of the bills at once. I am hesitant on this because yes it would help consolidate the loan payments into one lump sum that would have lower monthly payments than what they are all at the moment, it would transfer the responsibility to me if things went south.

So what do I do?

Needless to say with an average interest rate of 6.55%, we have a strong desire to pay them off quickly.  If only it were that simple.

Circumstances: We have a very young kiddo, rented home, one old/declining vehicle, and variable income.

I understand basic budgeting rules.  What I am mostly looking for is opinions on how to balance throwing money at loans vs saving with the above possible capital demands with the knowledge of increasing income in the ""near-ish"" term.

Fixed Expenses: $1750/mo (rent, utils, transport, etc)
Variable Expenses: $2500/mo (groceries, some ""staples"", baby items, entertainment, etc)
Child Care: $2000/mo* (Yes, OUCH)
Loans (min): $1700/mo

Total Expenses: $7950/mo (Yes, this seems like a ton of money to us as well)

Monthly Net Income: $12,500

Asset Base (Savings) ~$15,000 &lt;- Needs to increase

We have enough to live, that is not the issue, but a child and other expenses have held us back.  The first year of marriage we managed to pay ~29-30k toward loans, before kiddo arrived.  Couple other facts: we do not like debt (but do like education), have increasing income (about 10%/yr for 3yrs, then 100% increase), and stable jobs.  

1) In these market conditions, how would one balance priorities of savings and paying down loans when there is a significant change in income (expected)?  How does the income stream impact considerations?

2) Are there deductions others are aware of that available to help defray taxes, when phased out of loan interest deduction, but with massive annual interest expense ~20k? Taxes + Expenses feel very high relative to income, unnecessarily.

3) Any other reasonable tips and ideas, no I do not need ""decrease spending, increase income"", specifics ideas on spending or applicable challenges?

personalfinance,Student Loans vs 401k,"I think I am doing the right thing, but I want to run it by you guys.

Here is some background information:

I currently have two outstanding federal student loans left (down from a combined $11k in Jan. 2014):
$2,200 @ 4.625%
$2,700 @ 6.550%

Company Roth 401k match is 75% up-to $17,500 (IRS Limit) contribution. So, if I contribute $17,500 to my Roth 401k, my company will match $13,125. I'm 30 years old and my Roth 401k balance is roughly 25k.

I don't make enough to contribute $17,500 a year, but I am contributing $500 a month towards 401k (best I can do). Student Loan minimum payment is $175 for the two loans combined.

Here's what I'm thinking my options are:

1. Stop contributing to 401k completely. Get rid of 6.55% loan. Resume $500 monthly 401k contribution and make payment of $175 per month towards 4.625% loan.

2. Stop contributing to 401k completely. Get rid of both loans. Resume 401k contribution after but contributing $675.

3. Stop contributing to 401k completely. Get rid of 6.55% loan. Resume 401k contribution, with bumped up amount, and make new minimum payment per month towards 4.625% loan.

4. Reduce 401k contribution. Take a 401k loan @ 4.25% for $5,000 and get rid of the student loans complete. Loan length options are 12-24 months, with anything in-between. No penalty for early re-payment, if possible.

5. Do nothing. Keep contributing $500 a month to 401k. Make the minimum payment towards the loans for another 5.5 years.

Regardless which option I go with, the goal is that after the student loans are paid off, I am going to bump up my 401k contribution by $175 to inch closer to getting that $13k match. I'm fully vested in the 401k.

I am leaning towards option 1 but want to see what you guys think.",finance,1411023709
personalfinance,What's the best way/order to pay off these credit cards?,"Hey all, I need help deciding on the best order in which to pay off my husband's and my credit cards. Hoping to wake up to some answers!

Balance - Name - Interest Rate - Minimum Payment

$2,148 - Wells Fargo - 24% - $62

$1,658 - Capital One - 18% - $60

$1,275 - Chase Slate - 0%/8mos, $2k limit - $25

$861 - Citi Simplicity - 18% - $60

$515 - Amazon Chase - 18% - $25?

Total = $6457

We're not bad with money, I promise :). We have savings for retirement, taxes and emergencies, but have just been chipping away at this debt with little rhyme or reason, besides the balance transfer cards (Slate now, Simplicity before). The biggest issue is the Wells Fargo card. No matter what we do, because it was a ""college"" credit card, the interest rate can't be lowered. So for every $100 we pay, there's like $45 interest. I've got good credit, 731, but my husband is in the high 600s I think. Probably because of his utilization or somat.

Since May, we've paid ~$2400 towards our debt, from $8879. By that, you'll see we've paid about $500 a month total. Again, no real reason, just to keep adding money to our savings while putting some towards the CCs. We've never ever missed a payment, always exceed the minimums, and have a spare $800 to use. 

We can afford to pay these down, we just don't know the best way! Should we transfer a balance to the 0% card? Should we do the debt snowball? The avalanche? The ""slow and steady""? 

In case you were wondering, this isn't all just debt from crazy college life or shopping sprees. I had to pay for my mother's funeral while in college, working part time on min wage. We maxed out our student cards to cover it, but the high interest sucks balls. My Wells Fargo, which was 21%, was ""paid off"" with balance transfers, hence the Simplicity and then Slate. 

We have good incomes now ($85k) combined, but live in Seattle. I'd list the student loan debt, but that'd be a huge tangent.

I'm fortunate to still live with family so my monthly expenditure will be low, but I may pull more from the career development loan to fully secure myself.


The downside is the career development loan has a 9.9% interest rate to come in after I finish the course. So I am currently trying to decide whether to use the ISA when it matures to pay off the loan entirely, or get a personal loan of a lower interest to consolidate the loan repayment and use the ISA savings for future proofing/relocation costs.

I'm currently paying back student loans and a car loan, and the interest rates on those loans exceed inflation, so I'm throwing excess funds at them. After that, I will invest excess income in investment account.

I decided to see if I could open an account at Vanguard just so...I would already have an account and be immediately ready to start investing as soon as I had my debt paid off.

I made sure there weren't any ludicrous fees associated with opening the account, and attempted to. When I registered, I chose Individual, General Savings, and then the Money Market option (decide what to invest in later option).

The amount that I used to fund the opening of the money market account was $5.00. Vanguard let me open the money market account, and that's that. I have $5.00 sitting in my money market (municipal bond) account in Vanguard. I have the account number and everything.

 I've attempted to verify my banking info, had them deposit a few cents in my bank account, sent Vanguard back the amounts, and now they say that the accounts verified and they're just making sure everything's ok on their end.

Should I have been able to do this??

The reason I ask is because I wanted to do the same thing for my Dad. He currently has some amount of money invested with *some guy* that someone referred him to. Well, we were going through the application process to open a brokerage account, but Vanguard won't let him open a general savings account unless he funds with at least $3,000 (for either a money market account, or a specific fund). What gives?

Either I should not have been allowed to open an account for less than $3000, or they have different requirements for the applicants age, or, they changed their rules for opening an account within the past week and a half.

economy,Question on the QE!,"Sorry this is probably too long but it has been bugging me for a while and I’ve not managed to wrap my head around it yet. I’m a very rusty economics grad, so please be gentle and ELI5…

A bit of background: I studied economics at uni and am now working for a wealth management firm as a trainee investment manager. I’m based in the UK and so have been studying towards qualifications that will let me manage investment portfolios on a discretionary basis. During these studies they repeatedly use the quantity theory of money equation (MV = PT) as a point of reference for economic policy. 

My understanding of the quantity theory of money equation is that part of it relies on the assumption that money is an exogenous factor to aggregate demand and therefore can be used as a tool to manipulate demand and control inflation etc. In other words, quantitative easing policies are designed to increase the money supply, reduce interest rates and cause inflation through increased demand.  

In my final year at uni we learnt the Neo-Keynesian 3 equation model (IS-PC-MR) where they pretty much told us everything we’d learnt in the first two years was bullshit and that the money supply and demand for money is endogenous and actually a product of aggregate demand. Hence the interest rate is the way you control demand and not through the quantity of money. 

As you can probably tell by my mixing of theories and general confusion, I didn’t do very well in these lectures, which is probably why I find myself at this point. 

If my understanding of the IS-PC-MR is correct, QE does work to create low interest rates but cannot create inflation. This seems to be reflected in the UK data where banks sit on massive quantities of cash because no one wants to take out a loan and the inflation figures are, let’s say, sub optimal. 

Why then do we continue to use it as a stimulus? There are rumours of European QE where interest rates are already ridiculous and the money is going to do nothing else but sit in banks across Europe? What am I missing?

TL;DR What’s the point of QE? 

Edit: I may have gotten there with a bit of prompting. Rewind to 2008 and the world is in melt down. No one knows what to do or has time to debate the virtues of Keynesian vs classical economics, so just do both. Lower interest rates &amp; increase money supply. Boom, both ends covered.

personalfinance,Student Loans Interest and Tax Reductions,"Hey all, I am currently a senior in college.  My freshman year 12/2011, I took out a unsubsidized Stafford Loan to help pay for school, for the amount of 5500 and an interest rate of 6.8%.  Thankfully, this year, I was able to save enough money to start paying some of that off.  I made a 3500 payment yesterday to the loan, which was now at 6001 with all the accumulated interest.  I hope to pay off the rest in January.


Yesterday, my friend informed me that the interest on student loans was tax deductible: https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1CAACAG_enUS601US603&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=student+loan+interest+deduction

personalfinance,Thoughts on this man's credit building philosophy,"Having recently watched this video: [How to get a perfect credit score - Jay Morrison](www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVdt6jzl37k), I am curious as to everyones views on his opinions.

Video summary - 1)Credit is defined as ""the ability to make payments over time"". 
2) The way to build credit and make your FICO score jump is to show that you can make payments over time. Paying off your statement every month just tells your union that you have cash on hand. So his strategy is to divide your maximum by 3 and consider that to be your new maximum. 

Everything I have read on PF regarding building credit and paying off credit cards says to pay your full statement each month; have a zero balance. This view completely makes sense to me as you are saving money and not paying the interest rates of the CC.

However, this video says to build credit, you need to have a balance on your CC and always keep your balance at 1/3 of the credit limit. The only difference I can break these two down to is that for one you will be saving money by not paying interest, and the other you will be paying that interest but will be more dramatically increasing your credit score?

Again, I would love to hear everyones opinions.",finance,1411062723

personalfinance,To default or not?,"A dear friend of mine has asked for help getting his finances in order. I have my stuff together regarding debt and we've known each other for almost 20 years so I don't mind playing around with the numbers. I was in a HUGE surprise. 

He gave me access to his credit report and I'm shocked as how much trouble he's in. Most of it is student loan debt.  The rest is being stupid and wanting the new ""toy"" without thinking about the amount in his bank account- overdrafts etc. He makes enough to pay his bills but now that he's turned 30 he finally thought he should get his credit in order.  (At least 10 years too late)

All of his student loans are considered negative accounts.  He owes ~$70,000 on the loans and makes ~$31,000 net.  Federal loans are about $40,000. I've looked into income based repayment for him but was told because the account wasn't current, he didn't qualify. Hopefully he'll be getting a new job next month with paid overtime but fingers are still crossed on that - they may not give him the job when they see his credit history! 

I'm wondering what the best option for him would be as his credit is wrecked. And it will be 7 years minimum to get him back on his feet.  I do realize the loans have to be paid ultimately as he did get the education.

1) Pay minimum for eternity (the loans seem to be interest only in some cases).
2) Pay minimums and slowly try to chip away balances with bonuses etc (this only works if he gets the new job)
3) Let the loans default and try to work a payment plan out with the debt collectors. 

Thoughts? I'm leaning toward #1 or #2 but does it matter at this point if his credit is wrecked? Thanks!",finance,1411069481

My federal loans aren't the problem. I'm paying $180/month on them, and that's fine, I can deal with that. What I can't deal with is my outrageous loan through Wells Fargo where I'm paying $758/month that i have to fork over 3/4 of my paycheck every other pay period for.

personalfinance,Zombie Mortgage - How do I get rid of this thing?,"Hey all,

I have a zombie mortgage, I bought a small house for my wife and I back in '06 for around 98ish,000.  We bought at the peak of the housing bubble.  Within a couple years our house was valued at 40ish,000.  We tried doing the Loan Modification with my lenders, who the day I called sold my second loan and informed me that I would need to be at least 3 months behind in order to do the modification, also I couldn't pay during the modification.  

Long story short, they dropped my payment $20 per month, and added the amount in interested and late payments I had been accruing by not paying and tacked them on to the back of the loan, making my new load more than my previous loan had been.  I paid one month, when they raised my interest rate on the loan to make that $20 a month discount go away. 

My wife and I decided to walk away from the home.  In that time my primary mortgage company went bankrupt and the company that got my second loan when I did the modification got my first loan. Locks were changed by the bank, they even made some claims to the insurance for various things in the house.  They told me they were going to forclose, I told them that was fine.  Contemplated bankruptcy to get them to quit harassing me.  Then they stopped trying to get a hold of me.  I figured it was foreclosed on and that was that.

Cue to about a year ago, started getting calls out of the blue on this company and find out it never was foreclosed upon.  I tried to do a short sale, but the mortgage company wanted close to market value to get rid of the loan and I had a couple liens on the house that I didn't know about and couldn't find a buyer.

So I'm getting a few calls a week from this mortgage company wanting me to pay off the loan which is close to probably $140ish,000 by now.  The bank has told myself and the realtor I had helping me with the shortsale, that they have no interest in foreclosing on the house and that its worth more to them having me on the hook.

I have no idea what to do with this thing.  I ran my credit report and the mortgage only shows up on one of the three bureaus and I can't seem to see information about the liens.

I have no idea what to do with this thing and would appreciate any advice.

Bitcoin,Review of Robocoin ATM at the Merchandise Mart in Chicago,"I wanted to share the experience I had today using a Bitcoin ATM, my first time using one. It was a Robocoin ATM operated by Zenbox (Zenbox.us). They had it re-skinned in orange so it didn't say Robocoin anywhere unless you started to use it.

Location: at the 2nd floor of the Merchandise Mart in Chicago IL. It was located near a food court positioned right next to a Redbox machine. Across the walkway from 3 bank ATMs. Decent foot traffic. 

The experience: Nobody was using the machine so I went to use it. I planned to buy $10 USD worth of bitcoin. I started by entering my phone number, then it asked me to create a PIN, scanned my palm 4 times, took a picture of me standing in front of the kiosk, and scanned my government ID. I chose my drivers license but it could have been a passport too. Then Robocoin immediately texted me saying they were reviewing my application and they would get back to me in about 5 minutes. I went to get lunch and about 15 minutes later received a text saying I was able to use Robocoin ATMs anywhere in the world. I went back to the machine and entered my phone number, PIN, and scanned my palm and it was ready to accept USD to buy bitcoin. It did not tell me how much of a operator fee I was paying, I assume this was baked into the BTC price. It asked if I wanted to provide a bitcoin address or create a new one (I chose to create a new one, in which case it spat out a receipt with a private key on it). Then I fed the machine my $10 bill and it printed a confirmation receipt. Done. 

Other observations: 
- I stood around the area a short time while waiting for Robocoin to activate my account and took note of whether anyone else used the machine or if they noticed it. It kind of sticks out since it is all orange. 
- Of the steady stream of people only 3 groups seemed to notice it. One guy started to use it but did not follow through. Another pointed and laughed with his friends and another studied it from a few feed away before leaving.
- This was lunch hour, so at one point there was an enormous line in front of the Chase / Bank of America ATMs across the walk way.

Surprises: 
- It took 15 minutes to confirm my account creation. In comparison to a bank this is fast, but I was a bit surprised it took more than the 5 minute expectation they set.
- I was surprised they would print out a private key on a receipt, but they did. I guess I could have chosen to give my own address, but I went the path of less work for me in the moment. 

Overall an interesting experience that I wanted to share.",cryptocurrency,1411073179

Bankers also suggested, presumably out of a concern for national security, that Bitcoin be subject to the same anti-money-laundering procedures, including Know-Your-Consumer, that banks are subjected to.  Bankers explicitly suggested that Bitcoin be subjected to the suspicious activities reports (SARs) that banks must currently file. **Personally, this all sounds like an attempt at “raising rivals’ costs” to me.**


Interestingly banks also suggested that in “an economy hypothetically dominated by Bitcoin, its finite number (21 million) would prevent the application of traditional monetary policy tools to provide support…” *In other words banks are concerned that a Bitcoin world would be one where bank bailouts and assistance were more difficult to achieve.

personalfinance,Student Loans vs 401k,"Not sure if my posting was done correctly the first time. Sorry if it's showing up twice. I deleted the first one.

I think I am doing the right thing, but I want to run it by you guys.
Here is some background information:

I currently have two outstanding federal student loans left (down from a combined $11k in Jan. 2014): 

$2,200 @ 4.625% 
$2,700 @ 6.550%

Company Roth 401k match is 75% up-to $17,500 (IRS Limit) contribution. So, if I contribute $17,500 to my Roth 401k, my company will match $13,125. I'm 30 years old and my Roth 401k balance is roughly 25k.
I don't make enough to contribute $17,500 a year, but I am contributing $500 a month towards 401k (best I can do). 

Student Loan minimum payment is $175 for the two loans combined.

Here's what I'm thinking my options are:

1. Stop contributing to 401k completely. Get rid of 6.55% loan. Resume $500 monthly 401k contribution and make payment of $175 per month towards 4.625% loan.

2. Stop contributing to 401k completely. Get rid of both loans. Resume 401k contribution after but contributing $675.

3. Stop contributing to 401k completely. Get rid of 6.55% loan. Resume 401k contribution, with bumped up amount, and make new minimum payment per month towards 4.625% loan.

4. Reduce 401k contribution. Take a 401k loan @ 4.25% for $5,000 and get rid of the student loans complete. Loan length options are 12-24 months, with anything in-between. No penalty for early re-payment, if possible.

5. Do nothing. Keep contributing $500 a month to 401k. Make the minimum payment towards the loans for another 5.5 years.

Regardless which option I go with, the goal is that after the student loans are paid off, I am going to bump up my 401k contribution by $175 to inch closer to getting that $13k match. I'm fully vested in the 401k.

I am leaning towards option 1 but want to see what you guys think.",finance,1411101516

personalfinance,$100k-135k windfall. What do?,"Hi all,

I've recently become aware of some life insurance policy funds and other things that are coming my way, and was trying to devise a plan for what to do with the funds.

Some personal stats:

* I'm 28, live on my own, and earn ~50k/year. There are no kids in the picture, and I'm not planning on any.
* I have 13k in student loans. A quarter of it is at a 6% interest rate; the rest is at a 2% interest rate.
* I don't have anything in the way of an emergency fund right now.
* I pay off my credit card balance every month and own my car, so no consumer debt. 
* My rent is $850+ a month, and seems to be going up at least $20/year. I've been wanting to cut down on this expense some for a while, but I can't rent cheaper without significantly downsizing, moving to a less safe area, or making my commute to work awful. Where I live, it looks like a condo or small 2-3br house is running about 50-90k. . .but I'm considering switching jobs to close an LDR in 3-4 years, so I likely won't be staying in the area.
* Thanks to said LDR, I'm probably dropping $200-$300 in gas every month. My car's at 130k miles, so I've been hitting a number of major service appointments as of recent.
* I have a retirement plan through my employer that I think is a 403b. I contribute about $350/month and am a little bit past maxing out matching contributions. It's currently got about $15k in it.

Some ideas that I've been kicking around:

* My mom doesn't have much in way of savings and basically lives paycheck to paycheck off social security. I'd like to set aside a small cushion for her.
* I'm seting aside about $7k for personal medical expenses and payback for friends who substantially helped me out recently.
* Is it worth it to buy a house even though I'm not staying in the area long? I feel like If I keep renting, that's ~$30-40k I'm tossing down the drain. I never considered the idea before since I never had the savings to put down for a down payment.
* I've kinda wanted to trade my car in for a hybrid for a while. I'd certainly buy used if I had to get one, but I don't know how smart this is as my current car is fully paid off and still works.
* I'm guessing paying off my loans, setting aside an emergency fund, and investing a good portion of my remainder should happen. What would be good ratios for emergency fund/investing/paying off loans/possibly acting on the above ideas/etc.? If I invest, what the hell do I do? I couldn't tell you the difference between a Roth IRA, Money market account, or 401k etc. if I tried.

A windfall like this happened to my sister a few years back and she pretty much spent it all and had nothing to show for it in less than a year. I'd like to avoid doing that--please help!",finance,1411131288

personalfinance,Recent fed survey on finances. How do people retire?,"In looking at retirement and pre-retirement years, this is for families (aka, households, so includes single people mixed with couples and more.)

With 50% of households having LESS than these amounts, often supporting two people, how do people retire?  Even more, most of this net worth is home equity and thus typically untouched.

Mean net worth of course is far higher, but the scaling is such that only the top 5% of households have ~$1 million or more net worth by retirement or near retirement years.

personalfinance,Second Mortgage to Pay off Student Loan Debts?,"My wife and I purchased a home last summer.  We put 20% down.  We got a great rate (3.5%).  I still have about $90,000 in debt from law school.  I have been paying it all off with some extra each month, but several of my loans are at way too high a rate (federal subsidies for grad school are not nearly as good).  The debts range from 6% to a but over 8%.  I was thinking that a short duration mortgage would wind up saving me quite a bit of interest.  

Two things have kept me from going forward.  

First, the risk of default is worse.  If we undergo a financial hardship and I can't pay my loans, it would be bad.  But if I can't pay a second mortgage, we could lose the house.  

Second, is the possibility of student loan assistance of some form.  If a federal program is created to alleviate student loan debt, then I will have no opportunity to participate if I have paid it all off.  Also, closing costs may be prohibitive.  I'm not sure.  

However, the benefits are (a) a much lower rate and (b) tax deductible interest.  

By way of background, my wife and I earn over $160k between us.  Our mortgage payment is $1400 plus $1k escrow a month.  The house was purchased for a bit below $400, and we put about $90 down, and did about $40k in renovations before moving in.  I have a daughter born in April, and no other significant debt.

Finally getting a grip on the cc debt and paying that off ASAP. Moving out of DC soon and I'll likely make around 50k and she'll probably make 35-40k.

My question is should we save for a down payment for a house or keep paying rent. I feel like paying rent is just dumping money down the toilet. If we can swing a move to somewhere that we can live rent-free (family's house), we can seriously clobber away at the debt, but could also have a deposit for an inexpensive house rather quickly.

personalfinance,Can student loans be beneficial?,"Some important background information: I just graduated from a special high school where I earned an Associates degree for free. I returned this fall to continue on to earn a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering. I started this semester with a 3.44 college GPA. I turn 19 on Monday.

After scholarships I ended up paying $1600 this semester for books, fees, etc. I am ineligible for any subsidized loans or any other government aid, even though I no longer live at home and am completely financially independent.

I support myself by working quite a bit. I have been doing this for quite a while, and am getting by ok. I don't have much of a savings, but have started to be thriftier with my money. However, my grades are starting to slip. This is due in part to the tough ChemE curriculum, but mainly to not having enough time to study.

I have considered taking out Stafford loans (around $3k per semester, every semester that I am not doing a co-op). This will help to supplement my income so that I can focus more on school. If I do this, I will graduate with about $21k in principal + ~4.7% interest. My credit score is a 715, so I don't think I could get a better interest rate anywhere. 

Because I am co-oping, I have a 95% chance of landing a full time job at a starting salary of $65k based on previous graduating classes. This means that I can pay off my student loans, and still have a good income in my first year of employment.

Does this sound like a viable option? To me it sounds like the smart way to do things, but I hate the idea of loans (currently owe around $4900 on a piece of equipment for my business and $2k left to pay off on my car).

I consider myself to be pretty financially savvy but I've recently been reading some posts and have come to second guess one of my recent financial decisions and wanted your input.

Some background:  I'm 35, My wife just completed her Masters degree in May, so for the previous 2 years we've been running an overall budget deficit to the tune of about -$1k/month.  The reason for the deficit is:  I was paying her tuition as we went, and she needed time to study, so we had our son in pre-school.  These 2 items were difficult to budget for on one salary so I basically let it eat away my savings and went into debt (about 30K).  She's working now (and enjoys her job) and we'd started to pay back the debt.  Here is where my concern is:  I felt like we were back on track again, and the debt was getting paid down (but slowly), the debt concerned me because I noticed that my credit score had gone down quite a bit, and seeing the interest add to the balance every month was frustrating.  I now owed 27K.  I figured I had 3 options:
- Do nothing, and just pay it off over time.
- Take out a Home Equity Loan (my home has about 80K in equity right now) and pay off the CC's, this would lower my interest rate to 5%-ish and would consolidate all of my debt into 1 place.
- I've been saving money every month since my children were born to give them a gift when they leave home.  The current balance of their accounts is about $35k, I could borrow the $27K from them and pay them back with interest instead of the bank.
- Take out a 401K loan (I've been really good about saving into my 401k since I started working).  

I decided to take the 401k loan for a few reasons:
- Fairly high balance: My 401k Balance was at $230K, and I have a roth that was $29K. My wife had also started a roth and 401k at $1.5K and $700. 
- I would be paying interest to myself and not the bank.
- My Credit score would clear up (401k loans are not reported to credit  bureau's)
- The big one:  My company does their benefits in a weird way where they put all of our ""benefits"" money into an account that we can do anything with (including cashing it out if we want to).  I am able to pay all of my 401k loan repayments out of my benefits account (and not my paycheck).

Early 401k withdraw Penalty: 10%

Capital Gains Tax: 2.8% (Colorado)

401k / Mutual Fund: S&amp;P Index AROI: 15.39% (includes broker fee of .52% based on Previous 5 Year Average

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ok so I tried this at $100 401k Investment for the year with a $100 match by employer.  After applicable fees for early immediate withdraw I am left with $115.22 to invest where my only future tax is 2.8% Cap Gains.  Alternatively I can keep it in my 401k with a starting with $200 to invest but with a future liquidation tax of 32.39% (State/Fed).  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



After 5 years I have: 

401k - $429.63 (Pretax) - $290.47 (After Tax)

Mutual - $247.51 (Pretax) - $240.57 (After Tax)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, so 401k wins BUT, what if I provided a monthly contribution to my mutual fund and refunded myself with the prior years liquidated 401k.  Try to follow me... here is where I am hazy and sticky on this.



Let's do this at the same investment over 20 years, but with a monthly after tax contribution of $16 to my mutual fund.  So we start with $115.22 same as before adding an additional $16.66/mo (after tax) to my mutual fund.  Doing the same thing to my 401k, but at a rate of $8/mo because my employer has a match of 100%



So after 20 years my Mutual Fund sits at $28,009 but if I put the same money into my 401k it's at an after tax number of $20,703 well that makes sense because I am contributing more to the Mutual Fund, but if I liquidate my 401k every year from my monthly contributions I get back $84.70/yr or $1,694/20yr So we have a difference in account values of $7,306 gross and $5,612 net.  Basically I am putting in the $16/mo to the mutual fund and liquidating an equal $16/mo from my 401k at the end of the year so its reimbursing me for my mutual fund contributions.  



So, question.  Am I right or am I a fucking idiot?  Better to liquidate and pay the CAP GAINS on profit than to Pay the FULL TAX on the eventual liquidation of my seed and profits in my 401k?

personalfinance,Mortgage Question,"My SO and I were looking to buy our first home, and were wondering on a few things with regards to a mortgage.

Few intro notes:

* We'll be able to put down $150,000 in cash for the down payment

* I make ~$86k a year (~$2,500 per bi-weekly paycheck; 5k per month); she makes $45k a year (~$1,400 per bi-weekly paycheck; 2.8k per month); my parents will be giving us $2k a month towards this mortgage.

* My credit score is bad in the lower 600s (didn't find a job after college and had a hospital bill go into collections which I couldn't pay for, and became late on my student loans); her credit score is good in the 700s (very little credit history however).

We were looking to buy quickly mainly due to the market of houses getting swept up *very* quickly here in Seattle. With interest rates rising, and the house costs rising, we're thinking now is the time.

The worries for me with a private mortgage is not being qualified for it due to my poor credit history. I bring us both down. We were unsure if we should go the FHA route, or the Private route. The real big problem for me, again, is that I'm worried about is my poor credit -- yes, I've been making consistent payments now, but my credit score is going up very-very-very slowly (from 520ish, to now in the low 600s).

We're looking to buy a home around $600,000, put $150,000 towards it and have our mortgage be $450,000 over 30 years. Not sure what kind of rates to expect, but we expect the monthly costs to be $2,600-$3,400+ range. The problem is this is also 30-40% of our income not including my parents $2k; then it becomes 25-35%.",finance,1411195271

In the same way as its not decentralized, but distributed.  There are basically 10 people in the world who ultimately control Bitcoin right now, so it’s not decentralized.

In theory, anyone can “fork” the Bitcoin core if they don’t like the miners’ rules, but most people will agree that this is in-feasible at best.  It doesn’t help that no one knows who controls most of the global mining power or even who invented Bitcoin.  Sounds shady, and in truth, it is more of a black box than most will admit.

personalfinance,Investing student loans - smart idea? [NL],"Hi PersonalFinance,

As I am a student in the Netherlands, I am able to loan up to 300$ per month. These are student loans, so the interest rates are extremely low (0.86% to be precise). What's more, I won't have to pay back the loans in the near future.

I don't really need the loans, however, I was wondering whether it'd be a smart idea to do something with the money? Even transferring it to a savings account would break-even the interest, so might it be a good idea to invest some?

* credit card 1 - $9700 balance at 14.99 (min pay 200)
* credit card 2 - $3500 balance at 10.90 (min pay 90)
* credit card 3 - $3200 balance at 0% until 11/2015 22.99 after (min pay 65)

* medical bill 1 - $1750 at 0% (min pay 65) (no interest until Feb 2016, not sure what rate after)

The credit card 3 was a balance transfer deal that cleared out our Sears/Lowes/Capital one card that all had 22-26% apr.  

Additional detail that is a big contributing factor, my wife is 6 mo's pregnant (yay 1st baby!) and we're really concerned that our cash flow will struggle to have the new added expenses, (health insurance premium plus new medical bill and obviously baby-related things)
We've been prepaying the doctor bill ($237/m) until 1/2015 that covers prenatal and delivery, but i'm not sure what bill will come after the actual delivery from the hospital itself?

Some other notes, we have about $4000 monthly income after tax, and our budget currently covers about $2400 for everything (mortgage, utilities, grocery, car insurance, health/dental insurance) 

out of the $1600 remaining we've been paying the debts above about $850/m with $237 going to the doctor's office and saving the last 400-500, we have about 2000 in the checking account, which we try to keep $1500 as our ""zero"" just as the backup that has covered more misc expenses (oil change/new tire/pet vet visits/life curb-ball fund)

We also have planned expense of around 1000 to get all the baby things we need.

So basically, is a debt consolidation loan of ~$35000 a good idea to get out monthly outgoing reduced and possibly save on interest in the long run?  A lot of our debt buildup was from living way outside our means after some employment changes from 2008-2013, but we have not been adding any new debts during 2014 (aside from the baby medical) and we've gotten the budget back under control so we're not actually using any credit cards to pay for anything in almost a year.
My credit union (Navy Federal) has a 13.25% apr for 61-180 mos offer, is that decent, is there a target rate I could go for that makes a huge difference in our numbers?

personalfinance,"Allocation of 401k, Roth IRA, taxable","Hi PF! I've lurked for a long time but never posted before. I'm 29/married, sole breadwinner. Gross income of around 115K. I'm on track to max out both 401k and Roth IRA this year and plan to do so every year going forward. I also plan to invest about $10K into taxable accounts every year (but haven't done so yet for 2014). 

My employer uses Paychex (ugh) for 401k and I'm unsure of how to meet my goal of having a diversified mix of assets (e.g. some US stocks, some international stocks, some bonds). I would like a lazy solution where I'm not constantly having to make tweaks to the strategy.

I have read the FAQ, but what I'm unclear on is how much to take into account the ER of individual funds in my 401k. I know that I need to have some money in bonds, but all the available ones in my 401k have high ERs.

Debts:

1. 2 years into a 30 year mortgage on a 250K house. 3.5% interest rate. I have been prepaying about $300 month on the principal, though I've been reading that this is a bad idea since the interest rate is so low, and that I should invest in a taxable account instead.

Assets:

1. 2 cars, both paid off
2. $20K in savings account with USAA earning basically no interest
3. $5,520 Vanguard Roth IRA - VFIFX - Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 - ER = 0.18
4. $55,397 in Paychex 401k - Vanguard 500 Index Signal - VIFSX - ER = 0.05

Here are my questions:

1. How do you recommend that I invest in the 401k and IRA funds, given the options below? I have all my 401k money in VIFSX because it's the lowest ER, but I have thought about putting 20% into FVITX.
2. What to do with the taxable money that I want to invest? Since I have basically no bonds right now, would it make sense to buy the maximum of $10,000 in I-bonds every year?

Thanks in advance for the advice! Please be gentle, as I'm new to all this.

Below are the different options that I have within the Paychex 401k system.

personalfinance,Investment alternatives with extra money,"Hey PF I'm looking for some advice here on how to handle some extra money.  I have investments all over the place and I'm trying to decide what to do with the extra money I'm bringing in and figure out how to take advantage of the cash I have available that's not currently ""working"" for me.

Overview:
I'm 34 years old, single, and my salary is $85,000/year.  My bring home is a little under $4000/month.  I'm renting a house right now and am not interested in buying.  The house is small and is nothing super fancy but I really like it and I have plenty of space.  Cost of living here in the South, where I'm at is also very low.

Debt:
None.  I just paid off my 2012 truck a few days ago after 21 months, well early of the term of the loan.


Expenses: 

Rent, Electric, Water, Basic Internet and TV: $1000/month

Vehicle insurance: $127/month

Cellphone: $0  (paid for by my employer)

Food: Not sure.

Lifestyle: I'm a huge tightwad and have been my whole life so I rarely ever splurge on anything.  I already have everything I want.  

It might sound like BS but I can't think of anything else I'm missing in there that I spend money on.


Contributions/Investments:

401K: I'm putting in the max allowed of 15% of my salary and have been for a while.  Current value is between $60K-70K I believe.  My employer does not match any amount.  (So lame)

IRA x 2: I have a Roth and a Traditional IRA that I rolled over from a previous job about eight years ago.  I had not been contributing to it since but the value has steadily increased and has a value of $25K.  Max contribution to this is $5500 per year (around $450/month).  I've already started the process of automating the max contribution here as well.

Mutual Funds: I have two separate mutual funds that I opened about 9 months ago, with a current value of around $11K

Stocks: I invested very heavily in some tech stocks a few years ago and have recently liquidated almost all of them, taking around $8K in gains.  Right now I have $41K in cash sitting in my investment account with about $6K in some remaining stocks.

Checking: Current checking account balance is $11K.

Savings account: None.  The interest rates are so low I didn't bother with one.  (This is partially why I have the mutual funds.)

So, two questions:

1.)  I need to figure out what to do with the $41K cash in my investment account currently.  I suppose I should probably reinvest in stocks again and diversify.  This seems like the right thing to do but looking for some thoughts.

2.)  I tend to quickly build up a pretty good amount in my checking account, even after my current contributions.  I'm wondering if there's another investment option out there that I'm not taking advantage of.  Maybe CDs or keep dumping into stocks?  CD rates aren't great last I checked.

Any opinions or input would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Bitcoin,Using several mining algorithms on the same blockchain to prevent mining attacks,"I had an idea that maybe can be expanded upon by people smarter than me.

What if everytime the mining difficulty is retargeted, a fork of the blockchain is also done that takes the existing SHA2 blockchain and runs it using scrypt mining merge mined with litecoin. Nodes and clients running this backup chain would execute all main chain transactions, unless they were made in such a way that they excluded the main, and became separate ""backup coins"". However These ""backup coins"" would have no market value and they would be discarded every week at the retargeting and a new hard fork would be created, syncing all transactions and wiping the ""backupcoins"".

Should a node running this system one day detect a double spend had been executed, or someone was doing a block withholding attack, it would start to contact other nodes and ask if they detected the same thing. If it turned out an attack had been carried out and was already ""in the blockchain"", the main chain would be deemed corrupted and ""killed off"", achieved by having all nodes switch over to the backup chain, and to completely stop broadcasting further transactions on the corrupted chain. If all nodes switch simultaneously, the attack would not even be noticed by the end user, as the protocol would continue to function, just using a different mining algorithm with the same public and private keys.

A vast majority of nodes would need to have this system implemented for it to work, however it would not need any approval from miners, and would put miners completely at the mercy of nodes, something I believe to be optimal.

It would also heavily incentivize miners to disallow a 51% attack within the algorithm they use, as a single successful attack would mean the permanent loss of all mining investments they had made.

I'm not sure if this is actually possible to implement, but I thought I'd write it down. I think that the heavy centralization of mining we are currently seeing due to rising difficulty and falling price is putting us closer to the risk of an attack by a malicious actor, such as the banks that are currently trying to influence the US fed to thwart bitcoin.",cryptocurrency,1411249018

politics,"I would like to throw out the idea for discussion that ""free trade agreements"" we sign now could easily have the unintended effect of creating a ""freeze"" on state minimum wage and environmental laws, as well as many others.","(actually, I should have mentioned that the freeze in some areas would be intentional, see http://ciel.org under TTIP + chemicals)

I can hear my readers, yourselves, saying that this could not happen, but the fact is, it has been happening, frequently. lets look at cases which could occur identically here in the US, due to a change in any US federal or state law. (i doubt if it would happen on a local level, in most communities, but it might in a large city, for example, say creation of a community wireless system might result in a suit by an international telecom company to recover their ""lost potential profits"")

First, labor laws- Two examples are Centerra v. Kyrgyz Republic, where a Canadian mining company sought and won an award against the Kyrgiz Republic for a law awarding mine workers extra pay based on their having to work under certain kinds of conditions.  the second was a suit, which is I think still pending brought against Egypt in part for raising their minimum wage after the Arab Spring uprisings there.
[Veolia Propreté v. Arab Republic of Egypt](http://www.italaw.com/cases/2101) 

Both are international [""investor-versus-state"" (or ""investor-state"" i.e. ""ISDS"" cases)](http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/Transport%20Environment%20ISDS%20TTIP.html).  

Another example is Achmea BV v. the Slovak Republic - a ISDS suit against Slovakia for voting for a unitary healthcare system that attempted to limit a health insurers profits as a prelude to phasing out for profit health insurance. 

This kind of case is being brought in private supra-national courts, against the taxpayers of countries all around the world for merely doing what the people elected them to do, **adjusting laws to meet the changing times**. 

WHY? the reason is simple, controversial ""investor-state"" provisons have turned the free trade agreements (including three currently pending US FTAs, TTIP, TISA, and TPP) contain them into ticking time bombs which silently and stealthily undermine democracy for corporate special interests.

Lets look at the specific clauses which are doing this. 

1.) The investor-state dispute settlement clause itself. which basically gives a foreign company which is a member of a FTA *a specific entitlement to not have any laws or rules or conditions of operation changed which adversely impact their profits* - by another member country. So any change which is resisted by a single foreign company can override the interests of an entire country's citizens, forcing the country to pay the company for what it can convince a court is the potential value of what they will now suddenly allege to be lost ""property"".

2.) Standstill provisions: Standstill sets a floor or ceiling (the date of signing of some FTA) which nonconforming changes must comply to which cannot be moved beyond. To use an important example, in the case of agreements like TISA that seem to [reference GATS](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/20/a_plan_only_banksters_will_love), that date may be the signing of GATS in 1994 or early 1995

3.) ""ratchet"" provisions. A ratchet is a clause that bars any changes in the direction that reduce the level of liberalization or compliance with the mandates of the agreement. if an agreement mandates privatization. It would prevent any allegedly unsuccessful privatization from being reversed under virtually any argument. 

To me, it appears that the standstill and investor-state provisions in FTAs in particular, were designed to halt the kind of positive changes in working and living conditions widely associated in the 20th century from continuing in the 21st. They prevent a democracy from functioning in fact because they block the people's ability to elect new leaders and overcome these restrictions.

You can see video of a discussion of Standstill [in this Democracy now discussion between Amy Goodman and Lori Wallach](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/20/a_plan_only_banksters_will_love) of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.

Standstill mandates a freeze (and potentially, a rollback, if the mandate is not obeyed) of all ""nonconforming"" economically relevant national/state/other regulation that creates a defacto pinning of regulation that can only go towards deregulation, never towards more regulation (or in the case of services more government services), as of the date of the FTAs signing..

**The way to prevent this from becoming an ever more dangerous problem with each new FTA, would be to stop including these extremely controversial ""Standstill"" and ""investor-state"" provisons in all FTAs, (such as the 3 pending FTAs, TTIP, TISA and TPP) and announce our intention to no longer ever include or honor ISDS, ratchet or standstill clauses in past FTAs in the future.

This change is very important to preserve the functioning of democracy. Otherwise, the key ability of democracy to correct our practices as conditions change is lost, because any and all multinational corporations who have as little as a subsidiary (or buy one) in a trading partner gain these special entitlemenst which could result in multi-billion dollar payoffs unexpectedly for making any legal change. 

They gain unilateral entitlements to prevention of change. The little known ISDS, standstill and ratchet clauses in existing FTAs may be the real reason why so few new minimum wage, health and safety related laws have been enacted during the last 20 years, since GATS and NAFTA were signed.",cryptocurrency,1411255998

Boom. Coindesk.com interview is here. This great article and fantastic press is 100% thanks to YOU GUYS. Your daily upvotes, keeping this adventure as a daily front page story lead their reporters to contact me. Pat yourselves on the back! Great work!!!

. . . so many miles of adventure left. Since I am nearly exactly halfway, its time to let the cat fully out of the bag and announce this adventure will continue to New Orleans. That's an additional 1000 miles. Hope to see all of you Shibes down there for Halloween! Ultimate DOGECOIN TAKEOVER. I plan to be dressed like a shibe selling jello shots for Dogecoin.

Since that minor secret is out the bag, the merch on the above link will make more sense! 

OK, back to the adventure. I sincerely apologize for any negative connotations my last post had in connection with the town of Paducha. Paducha may be the 2nd coolest city on the Ohio River (other than Cincinnati of course.) Last night was one of the most insane nights of this adventure. Let me explain. . . 

Began to really mingle with the people of Paducha. Shook off my travel weariness and turned on networking mode. Ended up meeting a plethora of AMAZING people. Most notably a bartender named Lisa (names changed for privacy reasons). ""Lisa"" was a bartender at one of the small local bars Yoda and I traveled to. After hearing our story she gave us some free shots. We saw her later in the evening and after conversing some more, she offered to let us stay at her house, feed us, let us shower, and force feed us beers. Pretty legendary southern hospitality! 

Once we got to Lisa's house she realized she had locked her keys in her apartment. The only way in was for me to scale a 20 foot wall and jump through a window- in my sandals - no big deal. The video of this is on the DOGEhio Facebook page. 

Had a great time with Lisa! All love to you (your real name) when you read this lol! If you ever come to Cincinnati I will give you the treatment of royalty. The world needs more people like you, and I feel incredibly lucky each time I find one. All love! 

Woke up at Lisa's and at breakfast at the Gold Rush. MUCHHHHH WOW. I died and went to heaven with this meal that could have fed 3 gluttonous kings. 

My parents drove from Cincinnati to meet Yoda and I one last time before we end up in New Orleans. My mom tried to talk me out of it, but even she doesn't fully understand the top secret plot twist I have yet to reveal. Of course it is in the spirit of Doge and will make this Adventure even more meaningful to our entire community. 

Took it easy and explored the city of Paducha all day. So much ARTWORK! If you know me, you know I am a sucker for art of all forms. Such a small town having such a rich diversity of art - music, murals, craftsman, sculptures, paintings, ect. Was truly a sight to see.

There are heavy rains and thunderstorms expected tomorrow. Sleeping under a huge abandoned building tonight. If the storms hold up we may stay in Paducha one more day to watch football! Whoohoo! 

The my heart beats to the rhythm of adventure. I do not know how I will ever go back to ""real life"" after a journey like this. 

Well, love to all! Share the coindesk interview. The piece really means a lot to me, and the more shares it receives, the more it will mean to our entire currency!

7. I watch our foster brother for $300 a month and stay at home with our 3 kids and run our Non-Profit Corportation (it's a volunteer position for the moment)
8. The thing that is killing us is all of our medical bills.
I have a few medical conditions that need continual treatment and this year I had a cancer scare. My 3 year old also had to have a CT scan and and Endoscopy and my oldest, a 6 year old has OCD and has to have treatment for that. We have A LOT of medical bills from 3 different hospitals more than 7 different doctors and techs and no one will let us consolidate the medical bills into a payment plan. I REALLY want to avoid borrowing against the house if I can and with our credit scores I don't even know if it would be an option but we're being turned in to collections on the medical faster than we can pay them and the medical bills haven't even all been processed yet. Everyone wants at least $50 a month but that adds up really quickly when you have 10+ people asking for it.

personalfinance,My fiance (husband in 5 days....) is trying to ruin us financially.,"He's 21. I'm 22. We're both seniors in college. Right now, our income is 0. I made about $5000 post tax last summer and he made about $17000 post tax last summer. He has a job offer he plans to take once he graduates. The salary hasn't been negotiated yet, but it's an ibanking position, so it will be in the six figures once you account for the bonus. I don't have any job offers right now.

We're in a lot of debt. Between us, we have about $50K in student loans. We have an emergency fund of $10,000 and no other savings.

There's going to be a 4 week period after we graduate and before he starts working. He wants to go on a 4 week vacation abroad.

Uhh, what? Let's say we go to the archetypal cheap vacation - thailand. It's going to be about $3K in air fare if we're lucky. The rule of thumb is $50/day to live cheap and $100/day if you want to have fun. Let's meet in the middle at $75. There's two of us, so $150/day * 7 days/week * 4 weeks = $4,200.

So we'll be left with $2800. That's $2800 to move across the country, find an apartment (IN NEW YORK CITY! SO EXPENSIVE), pay any and all expenses, and survive until his first paycheck. Luckily his firm is willing to pay relocation for both of us.

And we'll be left with no emergency fund. If you want to wipe out an emergency fund, you should at least put it on our loans with an oppressive interest rate (the effective rate over the $50K is 3.83%)

This is completely unacceptable. He's kind of sad because he has never gotten to leave the country and doesn't get any time off until you gt promoted (3-4 years), but that isn't an excuse to destroy us financially, you know?

I can come up with:
The US cannot pay the principle on the debt at normal rates so interest rates will have to be kept low forever. 
If interest rates are near 0 for ever then the FED misses an inportant tool to curb a market correction or crash. So they need to be able to raise the interest rates -&gt; they need to unwind debt to be able to do it. 

Also another question, cant the FED just put a penstripe through the balance sheet. Just make it 0$ and tell everyone that noone owes the FED anymore. Why cant they do this?

Bitcoin,Devil's advocate here,"According to Peter Thiel, any technology needs to be at least 10 times better than the current tech for it to have a monopoly.

I would add to that the criteria that the new tech needs to survive a crisis in which the competitors die out.

PayPal survived the dot-com bubble while making it possible to send money via e-mail.

Bitcoin will have to:

1. Survive a future dollar crisis while making it possible to send money via SMS. But that is not enough. 

2. Since bitcoin aims to be a currency also, it also needs to offer 10 times lower interest rates than competing fiat currencies that may replace the dollar. Without low enough interest rates businesses will merely use it as a payment method (assuming the spread of converting to and back from Bitcoin is lower than transaction fees of competing digital payment methods).

3. One reason why governments endorse unsound money is because it helps them do deficit spending without raising taxes. So in a future world where Bitcoin is a global currency, there cannot be any huge government spending because such governments will always make Bitcoin illegal or shady. So bitcoin needs to outlive this era of huge government spending.

But, has never paid a bill until a month ago and doesn't understand dependence on a paycheck, and is often upset with me for how little I can contribute and I'm not sure how to explain that I'm doing everything I can. 

He has an investment portfolio that has about 850,000 in it, has additional savings and bonds I'm not aware of the total of (I've been told just forgot), earns 102,000 per year. We just bought a house which we own in full, and he owns his car. Cell phone and anything car related is a company expense including gas. 

I on the other hand had a rough/irresponsible few years between 17-20 in terms of ""too much car"" credit cards and student loans and have been paying for this debt ever since. 

He doesn't understand how credit cards work (has no credit score, I had to push him for the last 3 months to apply for a card as he sees no need for one, still doesn't) and now has the bills of the house.

He knew he'd be paying 75% of the house related things. The issue is within the fact that he's upset I can't save massive amounts of money, contribute tons to the house, be debt free AND pay for entertainment all at the same time. 

I know that I am maximizing my money well, saving what I can and attacking the debt smartly based off of interest rates but there is still only so much money on the table.

He works 9 hour days, with every other Friday off. I am 23 and make $28,000/year. I work 9AM to 1PM Monday through Friday. We both have college degrees in economics/political science and I work for a municipality and he works for the federal government.

The lean times are a result of a few things. We did way too many things in the past year, and we're realizing this now. 

We bought a house in December 2013 and had to pay our downpayment. Mortgage is about the same as rent was, but we now have less in our emergency fund and have home ownership responsibilities. Roughly $5,000 for downpayment. We got a WHEDA loan, no PMI, interest rate is 5.5%. 

We were engaged Jan 2013 and were married June 2014. We saved whatever we could, no less than $400/month, towards our 'wedding fund.' Total amount that came out of our savings was roughly $7,000.

August 2014 - House repair totaling roughly $4,000.

August 2014 - Car stopped working, not worth putting more money into it at this point so we scrapped it. Decided we needed two reliable cars to get to work. Bought a used 2009 Chevy Cobalt for $6,000.

We anticipated the house, we planned for the wedding....but we just watched $10,000 come out of our savings in literally a week and a half, and neither of those things could wait. We now have about $3,000 in checking and $5,000 in savings. This is the lowest our collective funds have been in our six years of dating/marriage. 

I just made a list of everything we budget for, and I don't know why I did that. I know our budget, I know where we can cut and I know what we need to do. Our grocery food, going out to eat, and alcohol/bar categories are the place we need to cut. 

Here's my question: How do you guys do it? How do you change your lifestyle and make the needed adjustments? It's so hard. We knew at the beginning of this month that we would need to eat and go out less, yet we went to a bar to watch the game with friends on Thursday ($30) and ordered in food on Friday ($16). We went on a trip to the UP and brought food to cook on the grill, yet we walked to a local pup and had some beer and bar food there each day ($80 total). 

If you have experience with this,  what did you do? We're 21 days into our new saving plan, and we aren't doing the best that we can. Not even close. We should be saving every penny, and we're not. 

I know this sub is typically about investing and finance related questions, but we KNOW what we're supposed to do. I'm hoping some of you had a hard time with this too and can offer advice.

Also, I only work ~20 hours a week. This increases in the winter, but generally I will still have some free time in which I could be doing part-time work. I would like to do something ""fun"" for me, but don't know how realistic that goal would be. For example, I would like to learn photography, massage, make-up artist skills, non-profit work (that pays, which is hard to find around here) -- just something that I would consider fun in addition to the desk work I usually do.

14k at 4%
17.5k at 3.88%

After getting my bachelors and getting a full time job ~4 years ago, my primary goal had been to pay off my student loans. I don't think I have done badly considering I bought and paid for a 20k car and bought a condo which gives me some small rental income in the mean time.

I had a goal to finish my student loans completely in the next three years, and use the extra monthly cash flow to quickly save for a house down payment over the following year or two. However, the interest rates aren't killing me so I was hoping you guys could give me some advice.

I have met ""the one"" and it makes me want to focus on the house down payment sooner and sooner. I'd like to be in good shape in the next two or three years. What is the best way to go about this?

Cleaning service: $190 monthly (This is one I am looking to get rid of. I am thinking this money could be substituted to take over the utilities. My husband disagrees and thinks it is worth it.)

Starting in February, my husband’s second student loan will come out of forbearance. This will be approximately another $500 monthly.

After the raise and this loan coming out of forbearance, our income/outcome will be $4,138/$2,849.

My husband has an HSA through work. There is currently approximately $880 in this account. We contribute $60, automatically taken from his paycheck (reflected above), and his work matches up to $1,000, to total $4,000 a year (which equals our deductible).

Our premium is $80 a week for health insurance, automatically taken from his paycheck (reflected).

My husband has a 401K through work. There is currently approximately $3,000 in it. His company matches 100% up to 6% of annual income. We currently contribute $41.60 weekly, again, automatically taken from his paycheck (reflected). I would like to up this to $75, or about 6% of his income, so they would match it fully.

My son has a scholars choice investment account set up with approximately $600 in it. We do not add any money to this account. Family adds money to it in lieu of gifts. My daughter’s will be set up with $250 at Christmas time as a gift from my MIL.

We are both insured for $150,000 and both kids are each covered for $5,000.

Those interest rates at 11.17% are a night mare. We tried to have this refinanced, but were denied without a cosigner. We could not ask our parents to do more for us. Since then, we have had a few increases in income (I picked up a second shift, my husband has had 3 pay raises) and a few decreases in debt (we have paid down some of my loans, paid off my car – a ’06 Trailblazer). Any suggestions on getting these rates down? Is refinancing a bad idea? I’ve heard consolidating is a terrible idea…. Our credit score is 740.

We have ZERO savings and seem to be rubbish at holding to a budget

How can we be consistently budgeting when I'm paid bi-weekly and our owed bill amounts are so different week to week?

How much should we be saving? Where should we be saving it?

Should we make contributions to our kids’ college funds at this point?

Is increasing the 401K contribution a good idea? Are we handling the HSA properly?

Should we be putting extra towards loans? How much?

Is taking over the utilities feasible?

personalfinance,"State and Alternative Retirement Plans (no social security), OPERS, STRS, and ARPs.","I'm looking at a job with the state of Ohio.  Briefly, employees do not contribute to federal social security, but are required to participate in a state alternative.  As this is a university job, the options are [OPERS](https://www.opers.org/), [STRS](https://www.strsoh.org/), or and Alternative Retirement Plan (ARP).  

**Question 1:  What is the difference between OPERS and STRS?  Is there a reason to look at one over the other?**

OPERS/STRS both offer ""defined benefit"" (x% of salary in, y% of salary out after retirement) or ""defined contribution"" (x% of salary into 401K like investment, live off balance) both with employer contributions.  The formula is obviously complex, but the defined contribution translates, as best I can tell, to a payout of 2.2% of your highest five year average salary.  For the defined contribution plan, there are 401K like investment options such as target retirement funds (run by OPERS/STRS) or individually specified asset allocations (Russel 1000, 2000, midcap, etc.).

**Question 2:  Defined benefit or defined contribution?  Do the asset management fees define the best option (OPERS vs STRS, investment option Target Retirment 20XX (0.2%) vs Russel 1000 (0.1%)?**

The last option is the ARP, or going outside the OPERS/STRS system.  The university specifies a handful of approved vendors.  Digging beyond my university's resources, I've found that going with an ARP makes things more complex.  As specified [here](http://www.ohio.edu/hr/benefits/financial/retirement.cfm) (*a different university's info), the university's contribution drops from the 14% for OPERS/STRS to only 9.5% for faculty/staff in an ARP.  Or more simply, the total contribution goes from 28% to OPERS/STRS to 23.5% for an ARP.  

**Question 3:  Given the 5% higher employer contribution to OPERS/STRS, is there any reason to consider an ARP?**  *Note, I am looking to ""set it and forget it"" for investments and in general look to follow index investing and allocation advice in the spirit of Boggleheads.

personalfinance,"At what point/interest rate/amount can you consider a loan to be ""free money""?","I graduated with student debt at around 50K.  About 5 years back, I was fortunate to be able to consolidate about 25K with a locked in interest rate of 1.6%.

I've had and continue to have enough liquid assets (around 60K in various stocks/funds/cash) to pay off the remaining 13K balance whenever I want, but am pretty sure where I'm invested in will return more.

Thanks to this sub, I've begun maxing out my 401k and contributing to an IRA about two years ago and I'm looking for some more advice.

The Bogleheads wiki has been my guide through this process, but my first choice of an investment fund was fairly poor - I've picked the Vanguard Target Retirement 500 fund, and it gave me a return of 5% over 2013 when the S&amp;P has increased ~25% over the same period.

I've noticed this about 7-8 months after I started contributing and have since switched 100% of my funds and contribution over to SPTN 500 S&amp;P Index fund. This fund has performed well, and has netted me ~10% in returns over the last year or so.

What I want to know now is, considering the poor bond interest rates, should I just leave my allocations as they are? Or should I still be contributing to bonds? Should I pick funds that track international markets?

personalfinance,Maybe moving to NJ from England - need help understanding cost of living please,"Greetings

I am struggling to understand the comparative outgoings between living in the UK and New Jersey, USA. Figuring this out will inform my decision regarding accepting a job offer.

My situation: single guy, 29, no debts, no moving costs, need a 1 bed apartment in north jersey, public transport is my only choice unless I learn to drive a car. Live pretty frugally generally. 

My questions:

* What will the approximate tax rate be when living and working in NJ? I understand that the higher rate is only 36% including state and federal taxes?

* Do I pay property tax if I rent or is that just for landlords?

* Taxes are very complicated... what does an accountant cost? (in England tax happens automatically)

* I'm told I can rent a decent 1 bed apartment in north jersey (Bergen County) for approx. 1100 dollars per month - is this true? [edit - I've doubled this based on feedback]

* Food is cheaper than the UK for sure, right? Same for VAT/sales tax generally

* It all seems so cheap, am I missing something? [edit - yes, healthcare, and apparently not having a car is a bad idea...]

* Or to ask it simply in one question - what can I expect my monthly outgoings to be in a nice part of NJ living alone, based on your experience of US cost of living?

EDIT - current updated assumptions about USA living costs:

* rent + bills will be $2,500 per month,
* food, booze, taxis/trains for leisure time $1000 per month
* tax 40% (conservatively - I think it will be less as mentioned, even at top-rate)
* Zero commuting costs as I will cycle [edit - but considering car option based on your feedback]

Any advice would be very appreciated :)

Now I have a $6.5K check, and I would expect to get another after the start of the spring semester. I was planning on applying it right back to the principle of the loan, but my partner suggested investing it (idk how) so that I would have a cushion for any future expenses.
    
As far as other personal debt, I have about $30K in student load debt from my undergrad which I have been comfortably making payments on since I was out of school. The interests on those loans are also less than the interest on the new federal loan (they're at 6% or lower while the new one is 6.21%). I have no mortgage or car payments, and really no other debt than those previous students loans. But I also have no real savings other than a small rainy day fund.

personalfinance,Should we refinance our mortgage?,"I've been fighting my husband for a year on this... he thinks I'm crazy. I want to do some kind of cash out refinance / Home Equity LOC on our house to pay off bills to free up some of our monthly income. (Looking to do some remodeling and purchase a vehicle)

- In 2011, paid $95,000 for our house. Was a Fannie Mae Foreclosure, and put 3% down. Zillow currently estimates that our house is worth 140-169k. Our current monthly payment is $850, including insurance, MI, taxes, and principal. 
- Approx. 7k in credit card debt
- House needs about 6-7k in repairs (house was a foreclosure and needs a LOT of work that we currently cannot afford, especially while we are trying to pay off debt).
- Also looking to purchase a new vehicle (currently no car payments)

What option would make the most sense for us? I'd like to refinance to get rid of the FHA mortgage insurance requirement, and take out around 20k. This would make us debt free, give us a small down payment on a car and allow us do some remodeling (new roof, carpet, etc). 

*edit - If it changes anything, we plan on being in this house at least 5-10 more years. We also both have excellent credit scores.

--------------------------------------
Edit for details:

- Our current mortgage APR is 4.25%.

- 90% of our current credit card debt is a result of making purchases for our home. We have already remodeled our kitchen, guest bathroom, and replaced about 1/3 of our flooring throughout the house. These were our biggest problem spots.

- We bought our house for 95k. We originally agreed to 125k, but the appraisal came in very low. I own by far the roughest house in the neighborhood, and I'm surrounded by homes that sell for $175-200k. Some are worth as much as $275k. When they did the appraisal, they could not compare our home to houses on our street due to everything being original. My house was built in 1981. All of the neighbors have remodeled.

- We have three main credit cards with the following balances and interest rates:

    - approx $1,000 with 0% interest until February 2015 (after that, around 20%)
    - approx $2,000 with 17% interest
    - approx $3,000 with 19% interest
    - Remaining 4 cards have relatively small balances that are paid off regularly.

- We currently do not have any car payments, our two vehicles are paid for. We are down to one vehicle... my husbands car has 240k miles on it and needs too many repairs to be worth fixing. 

- We live very modestly. Aside from mortgage, electricity and water, we have the following: car insurance, 1 cell phone payment, internet, hulu, and netflix. That's it. We spend about $400 a month on groceries and $300 on miscellaneous items, such as entertainment. 

- A LOT of our income over the past 3 years has gone towards remodeling our home, and overspending. Lowes really suckered us in. We are taking all of our extra money each month and shoving it onto our credit cards, only for them to pile higher and higher. We haven't made any repairs at all this calendar year.",finance,1411398396
personalfinance,Student Loans: 401k to Loan pay-off question,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to run a question by the PF community to get their thoughts on the following scenario.  My wife and I are in our early 30s with one child and another on the way early next year.  I have about 4.5k left in federal student loans and she has about 71k left on her PRIVATE student loans.  That is after paying on them for ~10 years already as they were well over 100k.

My question really revolves around her private loans.  We have monthly payments on our loans of about $750/month.  I have been active in my 401k since my first job out of school, and I am coming up on the point where I'll have a little over 100k invested.  I know that it is a bad move to touch any of this money, but with the amount we spend per year just on loans, I wanted to get the group's opinion on taking the tax penalty and wiping out or loan debt.  Would that be insane?

With another kid on the way and us basically breaking even each month, our other options would be to move to a cheaper house (already in a relatively cheap house), or find more money somehow.  I already make pretty good money and can work remotely so it would be tough to find a job that pays more but doesn't cost more to commute.

It would be great if we could consolidate the loans into another loan from a credit union or something similar, but the amount is just too high for any bank to consider.  

If other information would be helpful, let me know.

I read this as, if my right here is violated, I have the right then to sue, or if evidence against me is procured in violation of the above, that evidence can be tossed.

It feels like the US govt wants to make sure that no one can hide from them, though.  Which by the letter of the law is okay, but not in the spirit of the law. Which would require an amendment to the amendment, specifically regarding ""Concealment."" Do we, or should we have a right to conceal our activity from the Government?

Background: I graduated college a little over a year ago and currently have 30k in student loans at 6.55%.

personalfinance,Questions about wage garnishment,"(First, a quick aside, because no one told me this when I posted in r/studentloans the last time, and I think it's valuable information. Private loans do not enjoy the same protections as federal loans. They have a statute of limitations. Sometimes, loans you take out as a freshman will be invalid by the time you graduate college. It may not be great for your credit--I haven't done it, myself--but if you find yourself facing bankruptcy or just being broke, it's a nice escape hatch to have.)

Okay, so this is sort of a follow-up to a previous post I made in StudentLoans, concerning my mother's being stuck with my sister's private student loan debt. So, again, here's the rundown.

My mother co-signed on some student loans for my sister in Pennsylvania. I've since convinced my mom to leave for greener pastures, and she currently works in DC. After graduating, my sister almost immediately abandoned all plans to use her degree in business, married a man with a kid of his own, soon gave birth to another, and is once again pregnant. Given all this, she is either unable or unwilling to make payments on her loans, and has allowed all her private loans to go into default. To her, this isn't that big a deal, because she owns nothing by herself and is protected by Pennsylvania's restrictions against wage garnishment for private loans.

This has led the lenders to begin contacting my mother, expecting her to pay. I'd rather not see her have to shoulder that burden. Which brings me here. 

Since my last post, I've found out my sister made a random six-month streak of payments on her loans in the second half of 2012. Being she lives in Pennsylvania, this means we would have to hope for another two years of inaction if we want the loans to exceed the statute of limitations for collection. I'm not sure that'll happen, though, and I'd like to cover my bases, so here are my two questions. 

One--If my sister files for chapter 13 bankruptcy, how long would that last, and would an automatic stay have a good chance of protecting my mother's paychecks during that time?

Two--Being the student loan was signed in Pennsylvania, would all legal matters fall under Pennsylvania law? Specifically, would any attempt at garnishing my mother's wages have to go through a Pennsylvania court and be turned down? And if not, would the statute of limitations on the loans fall from Pennsylvania's four years to DC's three?

All help is appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1411408936

Upon entering the workforce, many college and university graduates who are unhappy with their student loans consider refinancing them. There are many reasons borrowers choose to refinance: some want all their loans under one monthly payment while others aren’t satisfied with their current interest rates. Upon receiving refinancing offers, it can be tough to decide which option is the best to choose. You’ll want to choose a repayment plan which achieves your objectives of refinancing, so consider these options before making your decision:

**Lower interest rate**

Those looking to pay less overall should look for a lower rate on their loans when refinancing. Private loans taken while still in school often have high interest rates and borrowers should take advantage of the historically low rates offered in the marketplace today. As of September 2014, Credible's lenders offered refinancing rates as low as 2.31%.

**Lower monthly payment**

Many graduates exit their grace period in the least graceful way possible: slammed with monthly payments. Borrowers are increasingly having to devote a large portion of their monthly paychecks to these payments, or they risk ruining their credit score for years to come. Those unable to make their current payments can save their credit by refinancing. Extending the term of the loan from a 5 or 10 year to a 15 or 20 (or even 25!) year loan can drastically lower the monthly payment, though more time means more interest will accrue. Need more information on short term vs. long term repayment? [Learn more](http://blog.credible.com/blog/2014/8/11/short-term-vs-long-term-student-loan-repayment#.VBxslufDahQ)

**Fixed vs variable rates**

When it comes time to pay up, many borrowers find themselves unhappy with the type of rate they originally chose. Those with high fixed rates from years ago are green with envy when looking at the historically low rates currently on the market. Those unhappy with variable rates often seek to lock in a more stable rate, in case they start to climb again. Either way, refinancing is an excellent way to change the term of your loans.

Someone suggested taking out a personal loan from my credit union to pay off my cc for the better interest rate. I hear they can be hard to get though. I'm not sure all the intricacies of balance transfers and  whatnot.

My credit score is a 712, which ain't bad, but I'm at about 55% of my current limit. I hear that's not good.

I've read some great stories here and seen sound advice. Not sure what I can do but watch my spending at unnecessary places like the app has already shown me.

Bitcoin,How Bitcoin could solve the Cash-in-Transit problem,"We recently discussed the excellent article by Justus Ranvier on [unbanked ATMs](http://bitcoinism.liberty.me/2014/07/29/how-and-why-to-build-an-unbanked-bitcoin-atm/?refer=libertyme). An unbanked ATM buys and sells bitcoin, but regulates its cash reserves by raising and lowering its prices. This got me thinking of a similar problem for merchants that bitcoin can easily solve, though I haven't seen it discussed before: the problem of moving cash to banks, or ""cash-in-transit"".

The longer a merchant's cash builds up, the more they stand to lose in the event of a robbery. Any cash intensive business is sensitive to this. For this reason, cash-in-transit has become a very large industry. (To give you an idea, Brinks commands 19% of the market and pulls in 4 billion/yr in revenue, and that's only for catering to larger businesses.) If the business is too small to merit using a third party, they'll send an employee which is another sunk cost. In a nutshell, moving large amounts of value over long distances is costly when using dollars. This happens to be the very thing bitcoin is great at, because the cost of moving $1M in btc is the same as moving $1. So, how do we take advantage of this?

The basic problem is that the merchant needs to get rid of their cash in exchange for bitcoin, so what they can do is advertise that they will buy bitcoin slightly above market rate. Then, *anyone* who trades on an exchange has an incentive to show up and take their cash off their hands. The merchant then instantly sells that bitcoin for digital USD, perhaps using a service like Coinbase. The higher the merchant sets his price, the more incentive there is for bitcoiners to come flocking and thus the more cash they can move. Of course, if the merchant sets the price too high then they will lose more money than if they had stuck to using an armored truck. However, just offering to buy above market rate creates an incentive for more people to set up accounts on exchanges, while competition amongst bitcoiners should bring the price down toward market rate. Thus, the number of bitcoiners should rise to meet the volume of cash that businesses need to get rid of. Make sense?

One caveat is that the current legal climate puts bitcoiners at risk if they show up to banks every day with suitcases full of cash. They could store this money away under a mattress, but a better solution is that they should only sell as much bitcoin as they intend to spend: because they end up spending dollars they got at a bargain, they are effectively getting a discount whenever they shop, whether or not that store actually accepts bitcoin.

Another interesting side effect is that for every merchant that does this, less cash ends up getting put into banks than was taken out. As a result, banks won't have enough cash on hand as they need to service their customers, in which case the FED would have to print more physical cash and delete more digital cash to prevent inflation. But the economists in here can tackle that one. 

What I like about this idea is that it is entirely separate from the problem of getting your average consumer to use bitcoin. It instead focuses on meeting the needs of merchants to move cash cheaply and creates a financial incentive for people to meet those needs.

**Edit**: I ran the idea by Coinbase. Here is what they had to say:

&gt;Hi Asherp,
That is an excellent article . Unfortunately we do not offer this service currently . Exchanging Bitcoin for cash even when a service/product is rendered may require the merchant to register as a Money Services Business/provided under current regulations.

&gt;However I will forward this request to (sic) your development team to see if we can offer this service in the future. Thanks for contacting support.",cryptocurrency,1411420218
personalfinance,[UPDATE] Currently employed for the federal government. Considering a position within the private sector. What are your thoughts?,"This is an update to a post that I submitted last week.  I appreciate all the very helpful advice I received and I would like to update the post with more accurate information to see if the responses are the same.

First off, I am an IT Specialist, currently employed by the federal government as a GS-09,  getting a raise to a  GS-11 in 6 months and a GS-12 in 18 months. I have been employed with the fed for 2.5yrs. I am roughly $40,000 in debt.  I recently applied to work for a Consulting Firm as a developer. Both positions are local. The list below depicts the compensation package offered by both companies. I am currently working to figure out more of the unknowns about the consulting firm.

**Compensation Package:**


Benefit | Federal | Private
---|---|----
Salary | $55,000 | $72,500
Tuition Reimbursement| None | None
Graduate School Assistance | $5,000/yr | Available for Consulting Employees (Not the section of the company I will be employed)
401K Matching| Up to 5% | 1.5%
Vesting| 1% Full after 3 Years, 4% Immediate | Full after 4 Years, Partial Vesting Possible
Pension| 1.1% per year of employment avg of top 3 years of salary | Retirement at 55+ with 10yrs+ at the company = Avg of Last 3 years of employeement
Additional Training| $5,000/yr | Unknown, 6,000 Free Online Classes Offered
Gym Membership| Free, 3 Hours/week (Total 156 Hours/yr) | $500/yr
Paid Time Off | Annual: 20 Days/yr, Sick: 13 Days/yr, Holiday: 10 Days/yr, Bank Available | 35 Days/yr (w/ Holidays), 30 Days/yr Minimum, Bank Available
Awards| Avg. $1,000/yr | 8%-10%/yr, $5,000 Sign On Bonus
Flex Time | 6am-9am Arrival Time| 9am-930am Arrival (Partially Unknown)
Hours | 40hrs/week | 50+hrs/week
Raises | Slow, but consistent (GS Ladder and Step Increases) | Roughly 3%/yr or Based on Performance
Promotions | GS11,GS12,GS13+ | 2 Years based on performance
Commute | 5-10 Minutes | 15-20 Minutes

I would like to get a graduate degree in the future, but not necessarily the immediate future, since I found out the graduate assistance is only $5,000 instead of the $10,000 I originally thought. The following degrees are what I am currently debating.

Graduate Degrees:

*Industrial Engineering

*MBA

*IT Degree


I believe the reason the consulting firm doesn't offer graduate school assistance is because the firm is a high demand company and excellent resume builder.

I am looking for any career or financial advice that I can get before I make the decision.  If there is any information missing, or details I might have overlooked please feel free to let me know.

personalfinance,"[EU] Savings account, bonds or something else?","Hello /r/personalfinance! 30 y/o fellow here looking for some advice.

Recently I went through my finances and decided to re-arrange some things. In particular, I felt that I had far too much money stored away in a savings account giving only a pitiful 0.5% in interest (I had close to €40k stored there).

I will soon begin working a job that should net me around €2600 a month, post-taxes. There's a retirement plan that gives me the option of paying 5% of my salary pre-taxes (~€208) and my employer will match with 10% (~€416), bringing my monthly retirement savings per month to ~€624.

After all monthly expenses are paid, I expect to have a surplus in the region of €1000 to invest each month.

FWIW, I don't own a house, nor do I plan to buy anything until at least a few years down the road.

Currently I have about €10.7k into a personal retirement plan (unable to contribute more this year), as well as about €29k in stocks/bonds (roughly a 70/30% split). In addition to these assets, I have €35k in a savings account that nets me 1.25% interest rate (can be withdrawn with a month's notice). Finally, I have been keeping at least €4000 available at any time in an emergency account that can be withdrawn with moments notice.

I'm considering buying a small car next year, which will probably cost me about €20k (cars are very expensive in my country).

My main questions has to do with retirement savings. Do I try to save more than what is included in my employer-backed plan? Any contributions to that plan are entirely tax free.

What do I do with the savings account? Do I put the €35k into bonds instead? Or just leave it?

What does /r/personalfinance think?

personalfinance,Loans: Interest rate reduction vs. 2 payments a month,"My loans are as follows:  
- Stafford Sub: $3,529.54 at 5.6%  
- Stafford Unsub: $2,657.05 at 6.8%  
- Stafford Subsidized: $11,107.49 at 3.4%  
- Stafford Subsidized: $4,513.20 at 4.5%  
- Stafford Unsubsidized: $12,704.31 at 6.8%  
  
Loan provider is offering a 0.25% interest rate reduction with autopay. The 0.25% reduction is applied to each loan.  
Since the loan provider calculates interest on a daily basis, I have read that paying twice a month (but still the minimum monthly payment) helps to reduce the accrued interest.  
  
My question is would the 0.25% interest rate reduction be more effective in reducing the total payoff amount or would paying twice a month be better? Ideally, I would set up both, but the loan provider's autopay system does not reduce after making any additional/previous payments before the payment due date. Thus, if I paid off x amount of my loans, autopay would still take the full min monthly payment on top of my already contributed x amount.   
  
Being new to PF, how would I go about calculating which option would be better?

*1099 position A, no taxes deducted: $5200 for the year*

personalfinance,"PF, I want to start fixing my life. Please help me.","I'm so stressed out I don't even know where to begin fixing everything, so I thought, hey, the Internet. Here's the tl;dr of my life. Two years ago I was completely debt free except for my mortgage, credit score of almost 800, owned my own house, etc. I was also in an abusive relationship. He forced me to quit my job in February 2013 only to get fired from his own job in May 2013. In September 2013 he turned violent and I was forced to get a restraining order and move from my hometown. I'm explaining all of this so there's a background as to why my finances look so insane -- I am usually a very frugal spender. It's not habits that I need to change, for the most part.

Ever since then, everything has been a complete mess. I racked up debt and didn't have time to sell my place. I tried to rent out my place, my tenants sublet, the people they sublet to trashed it and they disappeared. A few of my ""friends"" took advantage of me in my time of need and my retirement fund disappeared. I honestly don't know what to do anymore and I'm just so incredibly stressed.

Here's my current debt:

$166,000 mortgage on house, purchased 3 years ago for $186,000.

$1,354 owed to Capital One

$4,252 owed to Citicards

$1,275 owed to Amex

$1,181 owed to Chase Bank

$1,070 owed to Chase Bank

$942 owed to Care Credit

$862 owed to Discover

$831 owed to Chase

$505 owed to Amazon

*I realize now that it was stupid, but I signed up for a debt management plan for these accounts in September of 2013 and pay $600 a month with the goal of paying it off in 2018. I don't know how to get out of this or if I should. I don't have ANY active credit accounts now and pay for everything in cash and intend to do that until I basically die. 

Here are my current assets: 

Checking - $3,300


Savings - $4,000*

Stock Portfolio - $13,000

Lending Club - $12,000

*I can't pay down the debt using my savings because these accounts are all now closed, so I wouldn't have credit cards for an emergency. And I recognize now that I should have closed my stock portfolio to pay down my CC debt, but at the time my stock portfolio was outperforming my interest rates and that factored into the decision.

Here is my monthly income/expenses:

Income: $7,500 before taxes, ~$5,250 after taxes

Rent: $1,400

Electricity: $200

Cable: $80

Health Insurance: $220

Home insurance: $80

Renters insurance: $20

CC: $600

Mortgage: $1,000

AOAO: $600

Pets: $400*

Food/household: $200

Business expenses: $100

Total expenses: $4,900

*I get that this is ridiculous, but I had the pets before I had any debt problems.


As you can see, I'm cutting it really close. I have decided not to get a car because I cannot take the added expense. Now that the stage is set, here is my question. Here are the options I have:

1) I can sell my property now. I can probably sell it for the amount I purchased it for, $186,000, in the condition it's currently in (bad). I'll have to pay capital gains tax on the sale and I should gross about $7,000 on it, which will be mostly used for tax. So basically, come out as a draw. The challenge in this is that few real estate agents even want to touch my property right now in the condition it is in. (Kitchen cabinets are water damaged and kitchen counter is beyond repair.) 


2) I can cash in my stock portfolio to repair my property. If I do this, I'm more likely to make close to $210,000 on the property, but it's not a guarantee, and of course it means I'll need to hold on to the property vacant for longer. I'm worried I could run out of money while renovating.

3) I can cash in half of my stock portfolio and do minimal repairs (counter, cabinet doors) on my property, with the goal of at least getting $190,000 or so for it. This would have the advantage of giving me some cash breathing room and at least convincing an agent to help me, but I feel like I probably wouldn't make more than I spent. 

I'm leaning towards just selling the property as is and washing my hands of it. It's painful because it's in a very good market -- if my tenants hadn't trashed it, it would have gone from 186k to 210k in the span of a few years. But at this point it's more about the actual situation rather than what could have been. 

So -- what do you think, PF? 1, 2, 3, something else? I *think* I know the right decision, but it's such a big choice that I need confirmation.",finance,1411443557

At the end of the semester I would return back any money I didn't use. 

Taking out this Parent Plus Loan has stated the following at my school's website regarding repayment and interest


**What will my interest rate and origination fee be?**

*Repayment is a fixed interest rate of 7.21% on all PLUS Loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2013. Interest accrues on the unpaid balance of the loan from the date of disbursement by the school until the entire principal balance is paid in full. Failure to make monthly or quarterly interest payments results in the interest being capitalized (added to the principal of the loan).*



**When will I have to begin repaying the Parent PLUS Loan?**

*Repayment and interest will apply to funds after the loan has been disbursed. The first payment of interest and principal are due within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed. The parent may request an in-school deferment. If, after obtaining a Parent PLUS loan, the student for whom the parent borrowed drops to less than half time or withdraws during the period for which the loan was intended, the entire amount is immediately due.*

personalfinance,PF'ers! Thank you. Saved up $10 K for an emergency fund in two months. Any advise for my update?,"A couple months ago, I was delirious. Pre-approved for $550K Home mortgage and thinking I can move out without any money saved up. The only thing I had going was a steady paying job. 

With many folks here telling me that I am in no position to purchase a home let alone feel that my finances were great, I decided to stop hemorrhaging money on useless shit and work overtime to jump start my accounts. 

2-3 Months ago, if you asked me how much liquid money I had, I would have said, ""$1000."" I really kept justifying spending on useless shit, mini vacations, eating out like crazy, and paying for whatever, whoever, whenever. 

Forward to now. I decided that I needed to break away from that old lifestyle and invest in myself. I took advantage of the overtime at work.  also took advantage of taking some homeownership classes that would allow me to take advantage of down payment assistance programs from the mayor's office of housing. 

Now for an numbers update:

Credit Card debt: &gt;$1000 a month which I pay in full at the end of every cycle. This is a total of 5 credit cards. 

Emergency fund: $10000 in a Savings account through PenFed. Only accessible through transferring online to my main Wells Fargo account. 

Down payment fund: $5000 in a Savings account in a credit union.

Day to Day funds: Wells Fargo Checking: $1500

Savings Account: $1000

Retirement fund: $40000 in a 457(b), not accessible til I retire and if I pull money for anything, it will be penalized. There are ways to access it through catastrophic circumstances, but they have to be catastrophic as stated in law, or something to that extent.

Obviously my other accounts seem to be a little small, but hey, I am getting there. To be honest, this is my first time having accounts with a comma in there. 

My goal right now is to probably fatten up my down payment fund. I plan to utilize a First Responder Down payment assistance program though the Mayors office. Its $100K silent loan for up to 30 years if I purchase a home in SF. I figure, If I can save up $50K, utilize the $100K DALP, I will have 20% of a $750K home, which I can purchase a single family home in SF. 

All in all, I had to be honest that things will take time. Im only 27, and im grateful to be in a position to be able to work hard and save and make decent money.

Any advice would be great, whether it be about my specific finances, or purchasing a home in a year or two. If anyone knows any programs to purchase homes in SF, that would be great.

##Campaign Finance Laws 1867 - 1980

Let's first delve into a bit of history. 

Campaign finance laws first made their appearance in the US in 1867 when a law was passed that prohibited Federal officers from requesting contributions from Navy Yard workers. [Source: Fec.gov](http://www.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm)

However, more comprehensive reform didn't begin until 1907 when corporate contributions were banned under the [Tillman Act.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907) This was as a result of a scandal involving Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 presidential campaign. [NPR provides a great rundown of the history of US campaign finance law, which you can look at here.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121293380) 

Additional and notable campaign finance laws include:

* [Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1910 (FCPA)](http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/531/544609/Documents_Library/corrupt.htm) which limited contributions and required that federal candidates disclose financial information.
* In 1925, this law was revised and substantially strengthened, particularly in its disclosure requirements.
* [The Hatch Act of 1939](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act_of_1939) and its 1940 amendments asserted the right of Congress to regulate primary elections and included provisions limiting contributions and expenditures in Congressional elections.
* [The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Management_Relations_Act_of_1947) barred both labor unions and corporations from making expenditures and contributions in Federal elections.

In 1971, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which required full reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures, but also limited spending on media advertisements. These limits on spending in media advertisements were later repealed. The FECA also provided the basic legislative framework for separate segregated funds, popularly referred to as PACs (political action committees), established by corporations and unions. You can read more about the FECA and its amendments [here.](http://www.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm)

##PACs, Super PACs, and the BCRA

**So what is a PAC?**

According to [Opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacfaq.php), a PAC is:

&gt;  a political committee organized for the purpose of raising and spending money to elect and defeat candidates. Most PACs represent business, labor or ideological interests.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is a Super PAC?**

[Opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacfaq.php) explains that a Super PAC is:

&gt; A new type of PAC was created after the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in Speechnow v. FEC in 2010. These PACs make no contributions to candidates or parties. They do, however make independent expenditures in federal races - running ads or sending mail or communicating in other ways with messages that specifically advocate the election or defeat of a specific candidate.

&amp;nbsp;

**How do they differ?**


PAC | Super PAC
---|---------
Established in 1944 | Established in 2010
Contribute directly to a candidate or party committee | No contributions to candidates or parties
Up to $5,000 per candidate committee per election.           | Make independent expenditures in federal races to communicate with the public. (i.e. ads)
Up to $15,000 annually to any national party committee | No limits or restrictions on sources of funds.
Up to $5,000 annually to another PAC | File regular financial reports with the FEC, which includes a list of donors and expenditures.
May receive up to $5,000 annually from any one individual, PAC, or party committee. | 
Registers with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) within 10 days of forming.  | 
Treated as 1 donor for the purpose of campaign contribution limits. | 

&amp;nbsp;

**BCRA**

BCRA stands for [Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act), which was signed in to law in March 2002. It is:

&gt; a United States federal law that amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which regulates the financing of political campaigns. Its chief sponsors were Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain (R-AZ).

The Act was designed to address two issues:

1. The increased role of soft money in campaign financing, by prohibiting national political party committees from raising or spending any funds not subject to federal limits, even for state and local races or issue discussion;

2. The proliferation of issue advocacy ads, by defining as ""electioneering communications"" broadcast ads that name a federal candidate within 30 days of a primary or caucus or 60 days of a general election, and prohibiting any such ad paid for by a corporation (including non-profit issue organizations such as Right to Life or the Environmental Defense Fund) or paid for by an unincorporated entity using any corporate or union general treasury funds. The decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission overturns this provision, but not the ban on foreign corporations or foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending.

&amp;nbsp;

Now with all of that background stuff out of the way, let's jump into the Citizen's United case.

&amp;nbsp;

##What is the Citizens United case?

According to [Cornell University Law School's Legal Information Institute](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205), the Citizens United case stemmed from the BCRA's rules on ""electioneering communications"", which defines ""electioneering communications"" as any cable or satellite broadcast made within sixty days before a general election or thirty days before a primary election, and which ""refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office"". 

Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, created a movie titled *Hillary: The Movie*, which they planned to air within these timeframes and even conceded that its planned advertisements and VOD broadcast of the movie fall within this definition of ""electioneering communications."" As a result of falling under this definition, they were subject to provisions 201, 203, and 311 of the BCRA.

Section 201 and 311 require:

&gt; the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to support.

and Section 203:

&gt; prevents corporations or labor unions from funding such communication from their general treasuries.

&amp;nbsp;

[Citizens United argued that:](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205)

1. Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when applied to The Movie and its related advertisements, and that 

2. Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances.

&amp;nbsp;

##What was the main argument?

The main focus of the Citizens United case was free speech. They argued that the BCRA prohibited participation in the political process which is guaranteed by the First Amendment. 

Specifically, the case argued that **political spending is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment, and the government may not keep corporations or unions from spending money to support or denounce individual candidates in elections.** While corporations or unions may not give money directly to campaigns, they may seek to persuade the voting public through other means, including ads, especially where these ads were not broadcast.

##Supreme Court Ruling

The ruling was made in January 2010. By a 5-to-4 vote along ideological lines, the majority held that under the First Amendment corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited. [Source: oyez.org](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205)

Yes votes: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Kennedy.

No Votes: Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor.

You can read the opinion by Justice Kennedy [here.](http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Citizens_United_v_Federal_Election_Commission_130_S_Ct_876_175_L_)

&amp;nbsp;

[oyez.org](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205) has an excellent synopsis of the ruling, which reads:

&gt; The majority maintained that political speech is indispensable to a democracy, which is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation. The majority also held that the BCRA's disclosure requirements as applied to The Movie were constitutional, reasoning that disclosure is justified by a ""governmental interest"" in providing the ""electorate with information"" about election-related spending resources. The Court also upheld the disclosure requirements for political advertising sponsors and it upheld the ban on direct contributions to candidates from corporations and unions. 

&gt; In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Alito, emphasized the care with which the Court handles constitutional issues and its attempts to avoid constitutional issues when at all possible. Here, the Court had no narrower grounds upon which to rule, except to handle the First Amendment issues embodied within the case. Justice Scalia also wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Thomas in part, criticizing Justice Stevens' understanding of the Framer's view towards corporations. Justice Stevens argued that corporations are not members of society and that there are compelling governmental interests to curb corporations' ability to spend money during local and national elections.

&amp;nbsp;

## Effects of Citizens United

It is important to note that this ruling did not abolish [limits on campaign contributions.](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/contriblimits.shtml) The link contains a chart that outlines the contribution limits for 2013-2014. 

However, it does allow corporations to contribute to Super PACs which have no limits on source donations or on spending for political communications. The only restriction is that the donor cannot be directly involved in the operation of the Super PAC.

&amp;nbsp;


[The Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/01/23/new-study-counters-assumptions-about-impact-of-citizens-united/) wrote an article about the findings of a [recent study](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2046878). The study found that there were increases in spending in PACs and nonprofits after the ruling, and also discovered ""that the increases weren’t driven by a few, large expenditures — those exceeding $55,000 — but by larger numbers of mid-range expenditures between $1,000 and $40,000.""

The New York Times also wrote about the effects of Citizens United in [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/magazine/how-much-has-citizens-united-changed-the-political-game.html?pagewanted=all) and others. They even provide a [helpful graphic to illustrate how spending has changed since the ruling.](http://imgur.com/wbzhH3Z)

The Washington Post published [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/21/how-citizens-united-changed-politics-in-6-charts/) complete with 7 charts to show the impact of Citizens United. 

* [Chart 1](http://imgur.com/WhemIqV) - details all spending by outside groups from 1990-2014. Remember, the Citizens United ruling was made in January 2010. 

* [Chart 2](http://imgur.com/Ip1dUhF) - looks at all outside group spending through Jan. 21 of an election year.

* [Chart 3](http://imgur.com/6tWC39n) - total liberal vs conservative outside spending, excluding party committees.

* [Chart 4](http://imgur.com/zUO0Z02) - tracks the raw number of ads run by candidates,  party committees and outside groups beginning 130 days before the 2010 and 2006 elections.

* [Chart 5](http://imgur.com/36t5inD) - total outside spending with no disclosure of donors, 2000 - 2012.

* [Chart 6](http://imgur.com/QUawfx7) - shows the rapid drop in the amount of donor disclosure by outside groups.

* [Chart 7](http://imgur.com/4oCLVZQ) - shows the rapid increase in first term fundraisers by presidents.

The Priargunsky Industrial Mining and Chemical Union has completed a scheduled upgrade of its sulfuric acid plant, increasing its capacity by 25%.

**EDITORIAL:**

* Learning from mining's past

Public perception of uranium mining is largely based on the poor, unregulated practices of the industry's earliest days. But the industry has learned from its past, and modern practices and regulatory regimes have transformed uranium mining into one of the most highly regulated and safest forms of mining in the world today, writes Robert Vance.

Although prospects for the global growth of nuclear generating capacity have declined somewhat since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011, overall they remain good. New uranium mines will thus be needed to meet the increased demand for the uranium that accompanies such growth. However, in many countries, negative perceptions of uranium mining based on the legacies of past practices linger, and a lack of awareness of present-day mining practices and the management of mining impact can hinder the development of additional mines.

These are the considerations behind the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency's Managing Environmental and Health Impacts of Uranium Mining, a plain-language report for stakeholders, enabling them to assess mine development proposals based on technical information about the uranium industry today. Lessons learned from decades of experience and development from the industry's legacy issues were the driving force behind the move toward today's regulated industry where all impacts of uranium mining are considered and managed across the full life cycle of a mine. A recently published summary of the report, Perceptions and Realities in Modern Uranium Mining, sets out long-term goals for any country considering hosting uranium mining for the first time.

Currently I am in a job that pays $12.50 an hour and I am contributing 3% every week to a 401K. I have been putting $25/week into another checking account to act as my ""savings"". My average take-home every month is around $1440.

$440 for rent

$32 minimum for credit card

$410.44 for student loans

$85 cell phone

$160 groceries

$160 gas

$120 health insurance

$95 car insurance

average $85 energy bill

My total debts are around $50K in student loans and about $1200 in credit card debt. I have no savings because anything I put in there eventually gets taken out to make ends meet every 3-4 months. 


I don't know what my options are for making this work, other than ""making more money"" which is always more difficult than it sounds.

Long time reader here and a situation finally came around in which I need some advice.

First, background about me so you guys can provide better feedback. I am 26 years old, just received a promotion that bumped me just into the 25% federal tax bracket. My employer currently matches 25% of my 401k contributions, up to 6%. I have been contributing 6% since I was eligible for the 401k.

The company is making a move to a new provider and subsequently will be increasing the match to 75%, up to 6%. All of my current retirement savings are in the company 401k, I do not have an IRA or anything like that at this time. Also, all of this current savings is in traditional 401k dollars.

So now to the question. With the new provider, I have the option to make future contributions as Roth, while all matching funds and profit sharing will still be provided as traditional 401k dollars. Should I contribute my 6% as Roth moving forward, or just keep everything in a traditional account? Or maybe split my contributions 3% / 3% in each? 

I do anticipate future career growth and will likely be in a higher tax bracket in the future. Are there any disadvantages to having both types of money (roth/traditional) within my employer 401k? Anything obvious I'm not thinking of or considering?

personalfinance,My experience w/ peer-to-peer lending when traditional loans were out of reach.,"Hey everyone,

I'm sure a lot of you are in a similar position I was in when I was trying to apply for a motorcycle loan. I have great credit at just under 800 thanks to my mom starting me down the right path in highschool, but I didn't have the job or financial history to get approved for a loan since I'm 23 and right out of college.

On top of that, I didn't want a cosigner and my personal bank (Chase) didn't offer motorcycle loans. So thanks to Google, I ended up at LendingClub.com and rest is history.

[You can read about my experience here.](http://suitupalex.com/personal-encounters-lending-club/)

For those who don't know, peer-to-peer lending is based off of the idea that we need banking, but we don't need banks. Individuals can invest and borrow on one another and have a decentralized system. It was the only way for me to get a loan, because all they cared about on my application was my reason and my credit history.

On top of that, it's a great way to ease up on your credit card debt or refinance it. Instead of being stuck at your ~28% interest rate, you might be able to get a loan through Lending Club that's only ~18%.

gaming,My Gaming Story,"6/2/2012 was the day of my high school graduation.  My graduation’s value may be quite different from most of your graduations.  Though graduating from ANYTHING is a great accomplishment, mine has properties that simply are not common.  I graduated from Cal Farley’s Boys Ranch in the panhandle of Texas, a child-care facility.  While a resident at BR (which is what I will be calling Cal Farley’s Boys Ranch throughout this post) I was never really able to grasp the social aspect of my day-to-day life.  Aside from going to school, until I was 15 and headed to high school, I was never really in a position to make friends.   This is my story of how gaming changed my life.

Allow me to briefly summarize what BR is.  BR consists or 40 or so houses.  Said homes hold up to 12 children and are moderated by “house parents”.   The homes are split between boys and girl, and by “pre-adolescent” and “adolescent”.  Usually, the line drawn for pre-adolescent and adolescent is decided by age or what grade you are in.  With pre-adolescent being for children less than 14 years of age and/or not in high school and the adolescent homes being for those in high school or those older than 14.  BR is in some ways is its own city.  Not because you can find it that way on google maps or send mail there using that as your city, but because of the facilities it presents.  BR has an elementary, junior high, and high school; all of which are technically public schools.  The reason I say technically is because they are only for those who are residents of the program or children of the staff of BR.  (Excuse the lack of a proper segue)  This was the basic schedule:  Chores, school, free time, force fed religion, chores, repeat.  During free time as a pre-adolescent, if you were not with the entire household, you were not following the rules.  As an adolescent, you had the ability to earn your own free time and go do things around campus.  This is the last thing I will stress about this place, just to clarify the lack of freedom to maintain a reliable social environment.  The staff consisted of idiots. (I’ll spare you the time of that explanation.)
	
I was 17 when I graduated from Boys Ranch High School and fought for an accelerated graduation plan to do so.  Once I graduated, I was free.  Free to do as I wanted, with no rules, no regulation of any kind other than the obvious (to most) state and federal laws.   I had saved up about $2000 from my time at BR, since they really only *acted* like they wanted to help prepare you for you exit.  But, this was enough for me.  After relocation, I had about $1000 left.  I chose to spend a majority of that on a brand new TV, Xbox 360 and NBA 2K12.  Because while at BR, gaming was how I passed my time by.  Trust me when I say this.  Being told what kind of person you have to become from 9/19/2004 – 6/2/2012… you need to find something you enjoy and can express yourself with.  Games that allowed for great customization and visual progression seemed to be the most enjoyable for me.  This may also be the reason why I almost can’t stand to play campaigns. 
	
Anyway.

I began to play on Xbox Live.  Here is where I found a group of guys from Connecticut; they were my first friends following my graduation.  This was the first time I was ever able to be myself in front of people and not face repercussions.   This was a group of guys I ran into while attempting to find [an online association in NBA 2K12](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/627462-nba-2k12/62977593).  I joined the association but was soon booted out due to one of my future best friends complaining about my connection.  **cough cough ZACK**.  I began to play MW3 with them after my internet was upgraded.   Like I’m sure we have all experienced, when you game with the same people constantly, you can begin to grow somewhat of a strong bond.  I even chose to buy Halo 4 instead of toilet paper just so I could play with them, which stands as an awfully humorous joke between us to this day (#HaloOvaPaper).

Since my graduation in the summer of 2012, I have been moving from house to house, apartment to apartment and never really finding my niche.  Due to my constant relocation, I eventually sold my Xbox 360.  I stopped talking to those guys completely for nearly 6 months.  I regret not attempting to keep in touch with them.  But since the spring/summer of 2013 have been talking to them almost daily.

The release of the next-gen (now current-gen if you’re not a tool) consoles were nearing and I was still without a system.  I had the funds coming in from left over scholarship funds and was set to buy a PlayStation 4 to reunite with them.  But, like my life had shown me in the past, what I wanted to happen simply did not.  I won’t go into the details of the past year, but I've lived in two different states and 6 different cities and in no way could even dream of being able to afford a gaming console.

The slogan for my favorite game (NBA 2K15) this year is #YourTimeHasCome.   That couldn't be a more perfect fit to my situation.  I now have a full-time job with reliable transportation, a place to live and food to eat.  I have what I have never had in my “independent” life, stability.  I am set to purchase a PlayStation 4, TV and NBA 2K15 on 10/15/14.  I couldn't be more excited to get back to doing what I love most.  Not just gaming.  But gaming with a group of friends that have stuck with me for the past 2 years.

personalfinance,How big of a deal is filing state tax returns if I don't owe them money? (IL and CA),"Hello PFers,

I am an international student who did not bother to look deeply into U.S. tax regulations until recently. Every year my university would send out reminders about filing federal taxes so I have been very good with that, but somehow they never bothered to inform us about a separate state tax filing... so I only recently discovered that I haven't been filing any state tax returns for the past 3 years. 

How screwed am I, if at all, considering that I've only worked for companies that deduct all my taxes for me directly from my paycheck? I have had taxable income in IL and CA. 

Do I need to backtrack into previous years and do some catch up filing or do I just need to keep that in mind in the future? Where do I start?

personalfinance,Home finance help...,Me and my wife are 25 years old and buying our first home. We have decent credit and not too much debt. We are purchasing a home for 179K. We are financing 100% so we can use what we would be paying down towards closing cost. The interest rate is 5.5% fixed and we are financing for 15 years so we can have the house paid off before we retire and kids go to college. This puts out house payments at 1600/month. Combined we make around 80K a year. I have a few people giving me a hard time over this interest rate telling me that we don't need to do it. I know interest rates around me are going for around 4% fixed at a 30 year mortgage. We don't have the money for a down payment and closing cost and our bank will not finance closing. We have done some shopping around and cant find any other places willing to finance over 95%. I am also worried that if we shop around for other lenders that the inquiries into my credit history will drop the score and hurt my original approval.  Any input would be helpful.,finance,1411498366
financialindependence,Economics/Real Estate Question: Best time to buy a home for someone with a very high savings rate,"So - OK.  I am to make a hypothetical assumption here.  Let's assume that the federal reserve intends to increase interest rates sometime in the (not too far) future.  I think that is a reasonable assumption given my basic understanding of economics.  But of course nobody knows.

I have just about enough money saved up for a down payment on a small house in the area where I live.  And a new (and seemingly stable) job.  I'm not fully sure I am confident enough in the longevity of this job to buy yet.  It would take ~3 years to break even and I think I have at least that long here.   I would love to own, maybe rent out a duplex.  I'm good at DIY and think I could add some sweat equity to a property.

I can either buy a house immediately and lock in a low interest rate mortgage, or I can wait a few years and stash money into the stock market.  Assuming interest rates have risen above the expected return of the stock market and my stock market money will have hopefully increased in value - I could still buy a house (mostly) in cash some years down the road.  Another benefit of this approach, though difficult to predict, is that economics says home prices will be lower when interest rates are higher.  This also means if I buy a house now it may depreciate in value.

The question is - assuming interest rates rise in the near future, which scenario is most statistically likely come out on top?  Buy now or buy later?  And how will that be affected by the price of housing... and how regional will that impact be?  There are a lot of unknown variables in there that I don't know how to go about calculating.",finance,1411498480
economy,Measures of Gov't Debt...,"From what I've learned from my Macroeconomic Theory class, this [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/), and it's sister subreddit [r/Economics](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/), public sector debt is mostly a political issue. Very high levels of debt/gdp are possible, as long as tax revenue can keep up with interest payments (which is easy, as interest rates are currently very small in the US).

The popular measure of public sector debt is debt/gdp, which we've established is bad. My question to you, Economists of reddit, is whether or not Tax Revenue - Interest Expense month over month is a better measure for public sector debt burden.

If interest rates are high, public sector debt is large, and tax revenue has shrunk (recession conditions), then you have a right to be concerned about a country's debt burden. Right?

personalfinance,Credit Card with High APR,"Before I was forced to be financially literate (starting college), my dad told me to open a credit card. I didn't know then that I shouldn't carry a balance. He told me to charge stuff for school to it and that he'd ""pay it"". Turns out he was paying the minimum balance every month. 
            
Years later, the credit card company calls me and tells me that I'm late on a payment, so I go ahead and start making payments myself. I'm a little pissed at my dad, but that's a personal issue. I get the statement after years of it going to my dad (I know, I know, but let's focus on what I can do) and I have a $7k balance at 29%. 

Silver lining, I had to start budgeting my expenses and am aware of every dollar coming in and out of my bank account. I'm officially conscious of my financial health. I can pay this balance off in three years (a little less now, I've been paying $307 per month for a couple months) but the interest is ABSURD. 

Here's what I've done:

* I've contacted the CC company (1st Financial Bank) and asked them to drop the interest rate on the basis that I'm aggressively paying down the debt and that I haven't missed a payment in 6 months. Payment every month is automatic. They've refused every time (3 times I've asked).

* I've applied for an unsecured loan for the amount I owe through Wells Fargo at 12.5% for three years to lighten the amount I have to pay per month. Loan declined. 

Okay, so here I am. 

I either need to hear that I have no other options and that I'm stuck with paying this thing down for three years (or less if I can increase my cash flow and increase payment amounts) 

Or there's something that I don't know about (balance transfers to take advantage of low introductory APR? how do I transfer the entire balance when I apply for one of these cards and they give me a credit limit for only a fraction of the amount I'm trying to pay off?) 

Any knowledge or advice? I've done all I know. Thanks!",finance,1411500248

Butterfly Labs was literally is in the midst of shipping out completed products to fulfill the remaining millions of dollars of orders on our books and issuing requested refunds, when the FTC effectively closed the doors of Butterfly Labs without any chance to be heard in court.
 
&gt;At this time, Butterfly Labs is cooperating fully with the Temporary Receiver appointed by the Court.  A hearing is set for September 29 and Butterfly Labs has asked the Court to allow it to present testimony from key witnesses for the company.  Butterfly Labs intends to defend our business and our nascent and promising industry.  The government wants to shut Butterfly Labs down, and we are not going away without a fight to vindicate bitcoin, our company, and our employees.  Our continued focus is our customers and finding a way to continue to deliver products and processing refunds for those who have requested them.”

personalfinance,"Need a car, have credit problems. (CA)","Let's start a few years back.

In 2010 we bought a new home, and had a 'renovation' mortgage.  We paid $35,000 for a house, and got a mortgage of $87,000.  The contractor who gave us the quote to give to the bank to secure our mortgage, didn't bother to show up to do the work and avoided phone calls.  We were locked in to his quote....and it turns out it wasn't enough to cover what was needed.

So we go back to the bank a couple of months later asking them to make an adjustment to the mortgage, but they told us they could not. Instead, they gave us a line of credit and credit card to use to finish off the house.

Ok..so we move in at the beginning of August, and most things we hadn't packed away were laid on the basement floor.  On Sept. 21st, Hurricane Igor hit us, and we were flooded with 4 ft. of water in our basement.  Everything was ruined that was stored there..and insurance doesn't cover it.

So..we move on again..my dad agrees that he will do some work for us to repair things and move forward.  My wife gives birth to our son four months later in January, and two months later my father was diagnosed with Leukemia.  He passes away in December.

Again..we try to move forward.  However, less than a year after my dad dying, my wife (who worked as an MP's assistant) is laid off from her job.  She collects EI...and that runs out in August 2013.

From August 2013 until March 2014, she had no income.  We were doing ""OK"" with payments up until January.  We had a ton of debt...but we were making payments and barely being able to eat.  We were in overdraft every week and had about 10-20 available in the bank until I got paid.  From January-March we weren't able to pay on a credit card and line of credit.

Thankfully, near the end of March my wife found employment.  I finally was able to sell a second vehicle we were trying to get rid of, and we also sold our photo studio after trying for nearly 3 years.  Things were on the up and up!  Instead of filing for bankruptcy, I took the $20,000 I had available from the sale of my studio and paid off a credit card, line of credit, and part of another line of credit.  I took the money from the sale of our second vehicle and paid off what I owed the bank on it (I sold it for what I owed).

We paid the bank ~$26,000 in debt in about 2 weeks.

We went from April-Present doing well.  No missed payments etc...

However, here's the problem we now face.

We still owe $3,780 on a credit card, and $9,460 on a line of credit.  The LOC was cancelled/taken after we missed payments last winter, and we are just paying it off now with payments every 2 weeks.  So this obviously impacts our credit..but we paid off much more than this already.

The good news..is I have been offered a new job that will see me making $18,000 more a year.  The problem is it is located in a community that is about a 45 min drive away.  I currently walk to work.  In order to get to my new job, I need to drive.  My wife also travels to work.  That means we need a vehicle.  Not just any vehicle, but a decent vehicle that can handle a 100 km drive each day in rain, sun, or snow.

We actually found a 2008 Fusion with less than 40,000 kms for only $7500.  But..we were declined!

I don't know what to do from here.  We took it upon ourselves to pay off the bulk of our debt without resulting in bankruptcy...my wife got a job...and I have a higher paying job starting next week.  We are making double what we made last year..and don't have half of the debt.  Yet...we can't get a $7500 2008 Ford Fusion!

HOW do we go about pleading our case, or finding someone that can help us get a car?  I'm aware I'll get a shitty interest rate, that's fine.  I just need a car.

Also, how do we go about repairing our credit score as quickly as possible?  It's terrible right now, and we are nowhere near the situation we were in the last couple of years.  

I have an aunt who claimed bankruptcy a few years ago and managed to get a brand new car (higher interest though) without a problem.  She was also making much less than we are making.

It is so frustrating.  I'm hoping someone can offer some advice.",finance,1411529461

I made the purchase in April of 2013, and didn't receive product until November.

BFL has been at war with the Bitcoin community, they have it the other way around.

personalfinance,Trading interest rates for credit increases?,"Hello all,

I requested a credit limit increase on a personal credit card about 6-8 months ago, and was approved for a limit of 7500 with 9% interest.  Today, I requested another increase, and my credit union said that they could increase my limit to 10000, however would have to increase my interest rate to 12%.
Apparently, in the past 8 months, my credit score has decreased (680 -&gt; 640 +/- 5).  This could be due to a number of reasons, I suspect, including moving to a new rental property (credit checks from leasing agencies), selling and buying a car, or variances in my credit utilization across different accounts (I have not been delinquent these past 8 months).

I typically keep this particular credit card at a 0-1000$ balance, and never have more than 30% utilization between statements (which is why I'd like to raise my limit, to be able to have more than 2200 on the card at once).  I don't know how relevant it is, but I have also increased my income (currently 115k/y) and included this on my application for increasing my limit. 

I also have an American Express charge card, that I have also never been delinquent in paying, but have also rotated 5-6k through for a couple of the past 8 months (mainly paying my current tuition as I am finishing a BS), although usually I only end up with around 2-3k on it.  This card is advertised as having ""no preset credit limit"", I have never been declined on a charge.

I am hoping that someone can give me some insight into whether or not it would be a good idea to take the increase at the cost of the interest rate?  I do not typicaly carry balances, so I don't know if the interest hike will impact me that much, but I do not know if the higher interest rate will counteract the increased limit in terms of scoring.

Any advice you could give would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",finance,1411538990

personalfinance,"[X-Post from /r/debt] Where to Begin? $140k Student Loan Debt. Looking for loan consolidation, counseling / guidance... anything.","*It was suggested that we post in this subreddit as well. I apologize if I did this incorrectly. I want to note that we've taken a look at this subreddit's Student Loans section (http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans) and have found a lot of helpful information there.*

After a lot of hesitation about posting, I've decided to finally ask around on a few Reddit boards to seek advice for my boyfriend and I.

We are not married and we do not share debt or bank accounts, but we are committed to each other. We help each other in any way we can - we always have. When it comes to his student loan debt, we're a bit overwhelmed and just can't figure out where to even begin.

I've read stories about couples getting out of $80k - $100k of debt in just a year or so. We'd love to have the majority of it paid off over the next 4 years or at least get it to a more manageable amount.

He owes around $140k in student loans, most of which are private. Does having private loans mean you just can't get them consolidated? He made some mistakes after he graduated and he just could not make the payments so his interest skyrocketed and amount owed ballooned. His credit is actually amazing, though. He's really beefed it up over the last few years.

His monthly payment is around $1600 for his student loans. He recently lost a good job that was paying quite well and is making significantly less at his new job. He's applying for a second and possibly third job right now. I'm worried he's going to completely overwork and exhaust himself working all hours of the week and weekend. He's in his early 30's, I'm in my late 20's we are not afraid of hard work and sacrifice. But I am afraid of life passing us by while our heads are buried in making money to kill these student loans.

We've started off with small changes to save and make any extra money to push toward his loans. Cutting down the electric bill, phone bill, packing lunches, never eating out. We shop at thrift stores almost exclusively for clothes, furniture, etc. We're trying to use our talents to make extra money too. Photography, graphic and 3D design, ""flipping"" / selling things on line, painting Warcraft figures even.

That monthly payment he makes is so hard. There's got to be a way to get it lowered, right? My own personal student debt is at about $3500 down from about $10k at the beginning, so I'm not too worried about paying off mine. I want to funnel everything we can into his.

If anyone has had luck with any online sources, we'd love to hear about your experience or at least know the name of the agency. I've collected some names from the phone book and Google but hearing about peoples' actual experiences is always helpful.

Anything you could tell us would be so appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1411571524

personalfinance,Buying a new used car and looking for help on payment options - loan from bank/dealer or pay outright or?,"Hi everyone! I'm looking for some guidance on payment options for a new used car I'm going to buy.

A little background: I have never owned a car that I didn't pay for in cash. I've always driven cheaper cars (my 1999 4Runner cost me $1300 out of pocket combined with insurance money from my last car) and now I'm looking to buy something nicer, more reliable, and more expensive. 

The challenge: though in theory I know how loans, financing, etc work...I've never even looked into it so I'm not exactly sure where to start. I want to do what is smartest for me financially - my dad (who I go to for advice) is one of those who ALWAYS buys in cash but I'm not sure that's always the smartest thing. 

Me: single, no kids. Renting an apartment (will not become a homeowner any time in the near future) in DC metro area. Steady job in tech sales with relatively predictable income.  TransUnion credit score is 762 via CreditKarma.

The budget: $30K. Not sure yet if I will buy from a dealership or individual seller.

My options: 
1) Pay outright from savings. I have $50K in a savings account making ~.75-.8% interest. I do not anticipate any other large purchases in the next 3-5 years and have other money in investment funds. I anticipate I could get my savings back up to $50K in 4-5 years.

2) Loan from bank. My credit score is 762 as I mentioned. If I do this, how much should I put in a down payment, and how much as a loan? I have multiple banks - 1 for credit cards, 1 for checking/Roth, and 1 for savings. (I realize this may not be the most brilliant thing but I have my reasons). Which one should I go to? I have the longest standing relationship with the 1 for my checking/Roth but they don't have a physical location in the DC metro area.

3) If I buy from a dealership, financing through them. I'm not sure if this is a smart idea but in the commercials I frequently see all sorts of ads for low interest rates and all that good stuff. Are there usually catches to that? Am I likely to get a better interest rate from a bank? Are there usually penalties for paying off early (if I get a raise or something and want to get the debt off my books faster)?

4) ?

I realize that I'm in a fortunate situation to even be considering this...and want some human input and assistance on what I should do since I know there are tons of folks out there who have more experience with this than I do. Thanks everyone!",finance,1411572141

personalfinance,Trying to get on my feet after being homeless for a few months. Could really use some guidance from here (might be long read),"A few months ago I simultaneously lost my job and my apartment. I won't bore you with a long story, but neither of which were within my control. Fortunately, I have a minivan that I used as a home for 2.5 months. During that time period I was looking for work all day everyday and yet almost no one was hiring. I tried to see if I was the problem, but after going through my resume with several people, whom I trust to give honest advice, they told me nothing was wrong. I also consider myself to be very presentable especially in a I-need-a-job-to-live-environment kind of way. After 2.5 months of surviving ny the skin of my teeth I finally scored a job at my local Bestbuy. I absolutely love it even though it's only 28 hours a week at $10.25 an hour. I would love to work full time since I love what I do and I need the money. Currently, after taxes I bring home just under $900 a moth.
     Two days ago I was taking my girlfriend back home from her two days a week babysitting job that didn't pay much, but was nice to have a little extra income. On my way home I hit a deer almost in the middle of town. It was a freak place to hit a deer and made no sense. My already busted up minivan (I have previously hit 5 deer at the same time about a year ago) took even more damage and come to find out the radiator along with a few other expensive parts need replacing. Here's my dilemma: I don't have car insurance, I have studs on my tires because I can't afford or find any others (they aren't legal for another month or so) my van constantly gets pulled over simply for the looks of it, no joke. I was able to get my next door neighbor, who used to be a mechanic many years ago, to look at the van and tell me what's wrong. He said I could put water in the radiator and drive for no more than 10 minutes at a time. I can still get to work, but my girlfriend had to quit her job in leu (spelling?) of the situation. 
     I have major, at least to me, expenses coming up and I need help! Here's a short list to help gauge my situation: 
*I'm renting a small storage space in my martial arts instructor's dojo for $200 a month all utilities included

*I need car insurance and before I can get that I have a $115 debt for that insurance I have to pay before I can get it again. Car insurance is $115 a month
*My phone bill is $45 a month 
*I'm on food stamps ($200 a month)  so  I haven't had to pay much else for food
*Gas is terrible for me at about $150 a month (my van has terrible mileage)

     Those are all the expenses I can think of right now. Transportation is the biggest issue. I can get to work and back, but that's it. I get pulled over constantly because of how my van looks, and I can't drive at night because of the van and my studs.
     I can put water in my radiator before and after work to get a short 10 minutes of driving, but here's my issue. Winter is going to be here in a month so I will have to keep putting in antifreeze, which will not be worth it. My dad suggested I go to a local used auto dealership and get a cheap, working car that won't have too much markup. I am going into the dealership tomorrow simply to check out their prices, interest rates, etc. They markup there cars and interest rates a lot because they cater to people in situations like mine because I need a car.
     Putting money into my van at this point does not seem worth it. I'm wondering if getting a cheap, working car from the dealership is worth it. I don't have many options and I need a car that works and won't get pulled over almost once a week. I'm sorry this was so long. Thank you w/o much fir your help!",finance,1411575928
ethereum,Mechanism for increasing ether price stability (reducing volatility),"The US dollar is a stable currency with a very small degree of volatility not because the Fed is behind it as some uninformed commentators state (or at least, I'd argue that's definitely not the main reason), but because it is used as a means of exchange by all market participants in the US (and many in the world) and because of the latency with which market participants would adjust prices when the value of the dollar fluctuates.

More exactly, what this means is that if the dollar goes significantly down, market participants will rush to buy dollars and get goods and services which still have the same old price in dollars for the short term (because a significant amount of time would need to pass before merchants would feel the need to raise prices). If the dollar goes significantly up in price, market participants will rush to sell dollars for other currencies which allow them to get the same products at much cheaper prices from other countries/sources, for the short term. And so market forces will dampen the volatility in both directions, automatically.

Ethereum is interesting because the ether is essentialy used all the time to buy/sell resources (CPU/processing/storage) on the Ethereum network. This means that the mechanism above might work for Ethereum to ensure a greater price stability than that enjoyed by Bitcoin.

Perhaps it might work even better if certain mechanisms were adopted by the Ethereum network. I don't currently know how the ether price for buying resources on the network is adjusted, but I'm thinking the devs could add a latency to the adjusting mechanism (thus having the price of CPU/processing/storage track the real fair value with a small latency). Such that if the price goes down, there would be a latency with which the price for network resources is moved down (so that there would be a rush of buyers who want to buy network resources for a slightly smaller real price than the previous one). I'm thinking that if we added this latency for when the ether price goes up, it might affect the network as people might hold off from running their apps, but maybe you can think of something.

personalfinance,A penny saved. Worth more than a penny earned.,"Let’s discuss the US tax system for a minute. (This probably will apply to other countries as well, but I don’t know.)

Businesses are taxed on profits. A lot of newly self-employed people that don’t have a financial background struggle with this. I've dabbled with a side business where I sell things on Amazon/eBay, and I've frequented forums and blogs about this topic. Some of the people on there, bless their hearts, think that tax “write-offs” are like some kind of super-secret free-money bonus that only people “in the know” are aware of. “Hey guys, guess what? If you track your mileage and expenses, you can get $$$WRITE OFFS$$$!!! CHA-CHING!!!!” They think it’s like, beating the system.

No, smartypants… that’s how it’s *supposed* to work. If you aren't deducting all of your business expenses, you are paying more tax than you are supposed to. 

I’m teasing these people a little bit, but really, I don’t blame them. So if you are one of them, don’t feel bad… you don’t learn this stuff in school in our country unless you go to college and get a business degree. Additionally, individual, W-2 workers are taxed moreso on “revenue” (wages) than on “profit” (savings), so it makes sense that people new to self-employment would struggle with this concept.

So once, again, if you are a business, you are taxed on your profits, not your revenue.

(Profit = Revenue - Expenses)

Now, let’s try a case study where we compare the value of a penny saved vs. a penny earned. We’ll use 30% as a simplified “dummy” tax rate. This represents not only federal income tax, but also social security, medicare, and state income tax, and local income tax.

Right now, these are our projected earnings and expenses for the year:

Business revenue - $1,000

Business expenses - $500

Profit before taxes - $500

Income tax - $150

**Profit after taxes - $350**

Now, say our business is debating over whether to hire a new crack sales staff, or a consulting firm to help us cut costs. The crack sales staff will cost us an extra $100, and will be able to increase sales by $200. Netting the two together, we’re earning an extra $100.

Here is the new projection, hiring the crack sales staff:

Business revenue - $1,200

Business expenses - $600

Profit before taxes - $600

Income tax - $180

**Profit after taxes - $420**

The consulting firm will help us cut costs by slashing employee health care, laying people off, and cutting wages to near unlivable levels. Just kidding, they would never do that. They’re going to help us cut costs by $200 by saving on shipping, fuel, and office supplies. They will cost us $100, so it boils down to a net savings of $100.

Here is the new projection, hiring the consulting firm instead of the crack sales staff:

Business revenue - $1,000

Business expenses - $400

Profit before taxes - $600

Income tax - $180

**Profit after taxes - $420**

What does this case study tell us? In the first case, we hired the crack sales staff. They earned us an extra $100. In the second case, we hired a consulting firm who saved us $100. In both cases, we ended up with the same amount of profit after taxes. The world makes sense. $100=$100. For a business, a penny saved is functionally equivalent to a penny earned.

Now let’s try another case study, for an individual. Here is this individual’s projected salary, taxes, and living expenses for the year. I will once again use 30% as a simplified “dummy” tax rate. Obviously tax rates for individuals and business aren’t the same, particularly due to the way social security and medicare taxes are paid, but it doesn’t matter for this example. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, don’t worry… it doesn’t matter. Our theoretical individual is single and does not itemize his deductions. Once again, if you don’t know what that means, don’t worry.

Salary Income $50,000

Personal Exemption $3,950

Standard Deduction $6,200

Taxable Income $39,850

Income Tax $11,955

House Payments $10,000

Car Payments $4,800

Food Expenses $4,800

Vacation $1,000

Miscellaneous $5,000

**Net Savings $2,295**

Let’s say our individual has the chance to get a new job, and make $5,000 more in salary than the old job. The new job is more stressful, more working hours, and less enjoyable. Our individual wants to start saving more money, so expenses won’t change at all, just income. 

Salary Income $55,000

Personal Exemption $3,950

Standard Deduction $6,200

Taxable Income $44,850

Income Tax $13,455

House Payments $10,000

Car Payments $4,800

Food Expenses $4,800

Vacation $1,000

Miscellaneous $5,000

**Net Savings $5,795**

Now, let’s try another example. Instead of taking the new job, our guinea pig decides to spend more of his free time cooking, expecting to save $2,500 on food. He also will opt for a less expensive car, saving $2,500 a year on car payments.

Salary Income $50,000

Personal Exemption $3,950

Standard Deduction $6,200

Taxable Income $39,850

Income Tax $11,955

House Payments $10,000

Car Payments $2,300

Food Expenses $2,300

Vacation $1,000

Miscellaneous $5,000

**Net Savings $7,295**

OMGWTFJUSTHAPPENED.COM. That’s right folks, $5,000 of additional earnings is actually worth less than $5,000 of additional savings. $1,500 less.

The personal exemptions and standard deductions are supposed to be kinda-sorta related to what our necessary life expenses are. If you have dependents, your deductions will go up as will your expenses. They are letting you deduct a standard amount and basically saying, these amounts represent a baseline for your spending on necessities, and you are only taxed on expenses over that baseline. But the deductions don’t change based on what you actually spend. So saving a dollar is worth more than earning an extra dollar. 

If you itemize, it changes a little bit, but the core concept remains the same. As an individual, deductions don’t change with what you spend.

Because of this hack, I think of things a little bit differently. Cooking, saving on food, or anything else I do to save money isn’t just “sacrificing” or “cutting back”… it’s actually profitable, tax exempt income, more profitable per dollar than the money I earn at work. More money for the things I really want in life. Driving a cheaper used car is one of the most profitable things I do. Having a roommate is also profitable. Every time I have to look at his dirty dishes, I just think of how much much money those dishes make me, and it doesn't bother me so much.

Finally, I left out the fact that the more money you make, your tax rates increase, so it tilts the balance *even further* towards saving. If you’re in a high tax bracket, your additional earnings are worth *even less* than a dollar saved at the grocery store.

Earning money is a great thing to do, and I highly recommend it. However, saving money, at least to a certain point, is clearly superior. If your time is limited, and I'm sure it is, I would focus on eliminating unnecessary spending before focusing on earning more. It’s far more profitable. Once you’ve done that, then go earn as much as you want.

And next time your depression-era great-grandmother tells you that “a penny saved is a penny earned,” make sure to correct her. A penny saved is worth far more than a penny earned.",finance,1411578949

personalfinance,Taking a loan from parents to cover our student loan debt and reduce total interest payments. Downsides?,"So my wife and I have about $85,000 in student loan debt. There are about 10 loans that have interest rates between 6.8% and 7.6%. My parents have offered to cover the student loan debt with a 'family loan' at 3.5%. Obviously this would help us out immensely and reduce both our time in debt and the total amount of interest paid over the lifetime of the loan. My question is what are the tax implications both for us and for them? I know we can no longer claim interest on the loan payment we pay to our parents, but is there any other real downside to this deal?

By the way, there is no relationship issue regarding the loan whatsoever. We have a payment plan laid out and my parents are very relaxed about the whole process. My wife an I plan to have the loan paid off in about ~3 years.

* $900/month on 2 cars (The payments are actually lower, but we're being aggressive. One car has $6,500 left, while the other is at $23,000 - both have interest rates ~4%)
* minimum of $580 in student loans (totaling a stressful $85,000)
* $1750 mortgage (actually $1,570 + $180 PMI; I can remove this when I've paid another $32,000 on the house)

We both have 401Ks, and I also have a long term savings account that I dump $150/month into.

My goal (as I'm sure everyone's is) is to get debt-free as fast as possible.

Luckily, I have retention bonus coming up next year of about $55K (pre-tax.) Based on some calculators, I figure it will be around $30K after taxes.

My question is what's the best approach to take to reduce our debt-load:

* 1) Pay off both cars immediately, and then use the same payments towards the student loans  (bringing monthly payments to $1480)
* 2) Pay down home mortgage to remove PMI (This only saves $180/month, so it's nothing too impressive...)
* 3) Pay down the Student Loan from $85K to $55K - it still remains a large loan, but we'll definitely save a lot on what would have been interest payments.
* 4) Pay some things down, but use the rest as a safety net.

I've heard different schools of thought - pay smaller ones down quicker for ""easy wins,"" pay the highest interest items first (in this case the student loans).

We also currently are saving about $3K/month - though, to be honest, we're not saving it as well as we should be. Realistically, it's closer to $1,500-$2,000. I'd like to start putting more of this towards the student loans / more savings.

personalfinance,Should I take this job?,"Context:

I work for a very small specialized company. I am the only full time employee, so it's just me and my boss with part time help throughout the week. My boss unfortunately is very unorganized, foolish and untalented, which causes me a great deal of stress. Imagine the real life version of Michael Scott from The Office. However, she is a very good person, treats me incredibly well (many unexpected bonuses and lots of freedom) and places a lot of value on my skill set. That being said, due to her unorganized nature she has difficulty delegating tasks correctly which leaves me with a significant amount of downtime at my desk (like right now).
We used to have another full time employee, who became fed up with her antics and quit last spring. After he quit I convinced my boss to allow me to extend my hours and increase my salary instead of hiring another full time employee. This new structure placed more responsibility on my shoulders, but has yielded more success financially. Our book keeper said we've been doing better now than ever (despite our mediocre and inconsistent quality of service).

The Pickle:

The employee who left last spring found a good job working for a growing firm with great senior leadership. He loves his new job and has learned a lot (although he's constantly busy). This firm has taken on a lot of work this fall and is in need of a employee with my experience. My friend was generous enough to think of me and has gotten me an interview before they have even announced the position giving me a good crack at it. Obviously I am not assuming I will get the job, but I can't help but wonder what I will do if they do make me a tempting offer. This firm has very talented designers at the helm, and upholds a consistent quality of workmanship in completing projects. I admire their work very much, it is the type of place I imagined myself working when I was in school. However, my boss has been very good to me, and I would feel horrible leaving her after purposely putting the weight of the company on my shoulders. The thought of going to this interview excites me and makes me feel disgusted with myself at the same time.
I know I'm jumping the gun a little bit considering I haven't even gone to the interview yet, but can anyone lend any wisdom to the tune of loyalty in the face of new opportunities?",finance,1411590056

I've got a Home Projects credit card through Wells Fargo that I signed up for to pay for the furnace I got last year.

Are there obvious benefits to doing one or the other? 

The pros for paying the minimum I know would be keeping the ever shrinking $3K on hand as more in the emergency fund and paying other debts down first (but I don't have any).

* $15k CAD in subsidized provincial loans. No interest and no payments until 6mo after I graduate. Interest is prime (currently 3%).
* $20k CAD in subsidized federal loans. No interest, no payments until 6mo after graduation. Interest is prime + 2.5%.
* $22k CAD in a private student line of credit with the Royal Bank of Canada. Currently paying interest. Payments begin 12mo after graduation. My grandparents co-signed this one. Interest is prime + 1%.
* ~$2k USD in subsidized federal loans.

I'll be graduating in December and I'm wondering what the best way to pay down this debt would be. Other than these we are debt-free, have credit scores &gt; 700 and have about $1500 in monthly expenses, which we could probably reduce if we need to. Current income is ~$35k from my husband and scholarship, but we could be bringing in anywhere from $30k-120k next year, depending if I get hired soon and if my husband gets a full-time position instead of half-time.

Which brings me to a few specific questions. 

* Would it be wise to consolidate these, in either Canada or the US?
* Is there a way I can minimize forex fees?
* Would it be better to attack one of these before the others? Having my grandparents cosigned on such a large debt makes me uncomfortable.

personalfinance,I would like to refinance my home mortgage.

The interest rate is 5.375% and I am paying $698, with currently about $520 going to interest. I am also currently paying $52 in PMI, which has slowly been dropping over the years. The current loan balance is $116k.

I want to refinance to take advantage of the low rates, and also want a 15 year conventional loan. My local credit union is advertising rates and I can get a 15 year fix loan for 3.125% and a quarter point (~$290). I also have the option of no closing costs, where I can get a rate of 3.375 with an eighth point (~$145).

I have the intention of paying the loan off early with extra payments but am being patient for a year and a half while cash flowing my wife's education. Once that is done with, we plan on paying the loan off in a few years, starting extra payments in 2016.

I am confident I will be approved for the loan income-wise. My personal 2014 income will be about $80k, and we have no debt other than the mortgage. My main concern is the 20% equity value to avoid PMI. I went on Trulia and entered my house details, and they are estimating $150k, but I fear it is around $130 - 135k. We have $17.5k in an emergency fund, and I am contemplating putting $2k down on the principle to drop the balance to $114k. That would mean the house needs to be appraised at $142.5k. I have done upgrades to the house, so I hope that helps. My first question, will the bank's appraiser stretch the home's value slightly if it means getting a mortgage customer?

My second question is about which 15 year option to choose. I estimate about $4k in closing costs with an online tool. Here's is a chart comparison between the two loan options (assuming I put $2k down):



Comp | Closing costs | No closing costs
---|---|----
Rate | 3.125% | 3.375%
Closing costs | $4000 | $145
2 year balance | $101,172 | $101,395
2 year interest | $7,024.23 | $7,594

personalfinance,[28] Need some help getting my financial situation on track. Always feel like I'm behind the 8-ball. Looking for some guidance.,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some guidance on getting my financial house in order. I'm currently 28 and always feel like I'm struggling to  live pay-check to pay-check. I  have no savings, no investments and really no idea how to lay a proper groundwork for my future. I'm getting to the point in my life where I see my goals that I want to hit in the next 5-10 years, and have no idea how I will reach them unless I get a handle on my finances.

Here's the breakdown:

**Income:**
$40,000 CDN Gross annually. 
My net take home is ~$2278 CDN per month. (This amount may vary slightly, as I recently got a raise and my life insurance premiums may increase slightly next month). 
Salary includes benefits.

My salary will increase annually and I will be getting commission and/or bonuses as well. This won't start for another 1-2 years.

**Debts:**

* Student Loan #1: $13,512.62. Interest rate = prime + 2.5% (floating). Currently in grace period. Repayment begins January 1st, 2015. 

* Student Loan #2: $13,482.50. Interest rate = prime + 2.5% (floating). Currently in grace period. Repayment begins January 1st, 2015.

I'm unsure of what my exact payments will be.  Using the calculator on the CSL website, I'd  be looking at about $220/month for 180 months without repayment assistance.

* Capital One Gold Mastercard ($3000 limit , 19.5% interest. Only card I could get with my credit): $1206.48

* Shaw Easy-Own PVR: $78.40 (11.20 /month x 7 )

**Credit Issues:**

About 4 years ago I consolidated all of my credit cards through Consolidated Credit Counselling Services of Canada. I basically payed $240 a month until all my debts were payed off at 0% interest. This has had a drastic effect on my credit rating. I've had massive issues since finishing payments 2 years ago getting credit cards, car loans, etc... I believe I have whats called an R7 rating on my credit for another 3 years. I was able to get a credit card from Capital One, which I have now. I couldn't even get a card from my own bank, RBC.

**Expenses:**

* Rent: $913 (includes utils. until May 2015, then I need to pay for hydro).
* TV/Internet: $112.68
* Bus Pass:$84.70 
* Cell Phone:$62.15
* Gym Membership:$45.00
* Bank Fees: $14.95
* Groceries:$300.00
* Netflix/UnblockUS:$15.00

That leaves me about $720 /month for entertainment, eating out, savings and debt repayment. I just recently got a raise and was only making $30,000 prior to this pay period, so I usually had only about $200 a month left-over for these items.

**My short term goals are:**

* Purchase a vehicle (used). Doesn't have to be fancy, just something to get around. It's been very challenging to get around with public transit these past 6 months. (I had a car with my spouse previously but when we split up could no longer afford it on my own).
* Establish some kind of savings/emergency fund.

**Long-term goals:**

* Save up for a down-payment on a house.
* Start contributing to an RRSP or some other long-term investment to save for my future/retirement.


So, I have a lot of questions about what I should do and how I should start laying the proper framework. I've done a lot of reading online and I find it all pretty confusing. There are so many different types of savings accounts (e-savings, TFSA's, etc...).

**Some questions I have:**

* I'm considering switching to an online bank like Tangerine for my day-to-day banking. I never use the brick and mortar RBC locations, other than to cash cheques once and a while. So it would be nice to save $14.95 per month in fees. Is there any reason I shouldn't switch everything over to Tangerine and get an online chequing/savings/tfsa/rrsp and just cut out the brick and mortar banks?

* Where should I start in terms of savings. Right now I have an RBC high interest e-savings account, but a balance of $0. I'd like to start seriously putting some money away, especially for some emergency funds and short term savings goals. But there are TFSA's, Investment savings accounts, e-savings or regular savings accounts... so confused...

* I'm looking to make some changes to my expenses to increase the amount I can save. I'd like to find a cheaper apartment, as it stands I'm spending 44% of my income on rent. I'm also going to look into a cheaper TV/internet plan as well as gym membership.

* My big concerns are ensuring that with my upcoming student loan payments, I still have enough to put money away in savings and live a decent lifestyle (subjective I know). But I'm tired of scrounging by. Even having $100 a month ""play money"" would be a change of pace for me.

Any advice you guys can give me would be greatly appreciated.

**Current Debts:**

Student loan 1: 6.7k.  Monthly payment $122*.  6.8% interest rate

Student loan 2: 12k.  Monthly payment $88.  3% interest rate.

Student loan 3: 14k.  Includent because it's on my record but right now parents are taking care of it for me (I'm spoiled).  Including for financial history plus if something happens to my mothers job I'll have to pick it up.

**Bills:**

Rent: $503.32 / month.

Utilities: $80/month.  Might spike due to winter

Cell Phone: $35/month

Gas: Anywhere from 150-250 a month.  Depends on how much I drive home.

Incidentals: $100 a month

Food: $50 a week (200 a month)

**Total bills plus minimum loan payment: 1360/month**

**Total bills plus saving ($500/month) 1860/month**

**Take home pay: 2800/month** (slightly higher now but I'll have to pay for insurance at the end of next month).

**Left over:  940/month.**

(I usually put an extra 3-500 towards the loans to get them paid off).

I put the * because I'm not sure of the monthly payment.  Before it was a grouped loan but I payed off two of the groups.  The website won't tell me my monthly payment because I'm ahead until April 2015.

My total credit card debt is whatever the sandwich I had for lunch today was.

By the time I buy the car my take home will be 2.8k a month.  Right now it's slightly higher due to being on my parents insurance.

What's complicating this is in April of next year I want to get an apartment by myself, or possibly with a friend of mine.  I'm currently not liking my living situation due to annoying pets.  I still need to look at apartments because my quick research has shown prices all over the place.  Right now my rent is abnormally low due to an uncaring land lord and 3 roommates (we rent a house).  I live west of Boston so prices here are a bit high.  However by that time I should receive a raise.  Not sure how much.  I've been killing it at work but I don't know how large of a raise my work likes to hand out.

My car insurance is currently paid for.  I'm not sure how much it is because, as I am spoiled, I haven't paid it yet.  Considering my clean driving record and the fact that my current vehicle isn't worth much it's probably very low.  If possible I would like to keep my current vehicle as I like having access to a truck and I like to tinker under the hood.  Having a vehicle I don't have to worry about breaking down due to a botched repair job is worth it to me as long as insurance doesn't eat me up.

Right now I'm thinking I want to continue paying off the 6.8% loan aggressively then probably pay the minimum on the remaining loan due to the amount being so low.  Is this a good idea?

Also how much should I be looking to pay for a new car?  My plan there was to try to finance a longer loan and then pay it off aggressively as I have money.  I'm thinking a 5 year loan and then plan to pay it off in 3.",finance,1411610977
personalfinance,Is this a reasonable budget moving to a new city?,"I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2etoxo/just_got_offered_a_job_in_pasadena_ca_need_to/) a while back about if I was able to live on 45k in Pasadena, CA. (TLDR everyone said no). Since then I've talk to my boss and now the new salary is 51k. I've decided that I will take the job offer because I feel like that is enough to live on my own.


Now, that it's almost official, I really want to set up a budget on what to expect when I move. If you guys can let me know how reasonable this is, that would be amazing!


I used this [site](http://www.calculator.net/take-home-pay-calculator.html) to calculate my take home pay after federal and state taxes. According to it my monthly pay will be $2682 which is what I'm going to base my monthly budget on.

Ok, here we go:


-Student Loan: $150


-Car Loan: $500 (Car loan is $228 a month however because I use a credit union for my loan, it takes $500 out of my account each month. The rest of the money ($272) is saved. Since I started paying my car I decided to never touch that money. So far I have about $4,000 saved up in a different account.)


-Rent: $1000 (even though my job is in an expensive area, I plan on living South to where rent is around $1000). At the moment, I don't want a roommate. This will probably change later on, but I want to plan as if I'll be living alone.


-Utilities: $150 (I think this should be reasonable because I'll only have internet aside from the usual utilities)


-Phone: $85


-Grocery: $350 (national average is $302)


-Gas: $100 (This is very very generous. I have a hybrid and currently I spend about $40 a month.)


-Car Insurance: $50 (averaged although I will probably pay it all at once every 6 months).


-Health and dental insurance: $0 (Thankfully I can stay on my dad's insurance as there is no difference to him if I stay or not. I'm 22 so I have some time until I can't use his anymore)


That leaves $297 left. I have yet to include any entertainment which could be taken from the remainder. I'm not quite sure how much of this I will actually use up. I don't drink or anything. 


I don't know if I'm forgetting anything else. 


Lastly, my boss is paying for the move, so I don't need to worry about that at all. Even moving my car for me. I also have enough saved up for buying new furniture and also first months rent and deposit, so no need to mention anything about that because it's all taken care of.",finance,1411611056
personalfinance,"29yr old with ~100k in student loans, and wondering when life can happen...","Hi all,


First off, thank you in advance for your time and any responses or insight you all may be able to provide...

I've been out of school for about 3 years now, and been doing my best to save and payoff the devastation my early twenties and college career left in its wake. After attending a private university following two years of screwing around and an associate's degree, I'm sitting on roughly $100,000 in student loan debt. My mother, thankfully, is paying about $125/mo for me, as she had promised to when I decided to goto college- as the first person on both sides of my family to goto college, I got to learn all the valuable lessons about scholarships/grants the hard way, and just took out loans to a 24k/yr private school. I have a double major from a premier school to show for it, but that seems tribal when I get the loan bills each month. 

I've paid off 6k in credit card debt from college, with an additional 8k left. Even though I worked full time in college, my checks were all from minimum wage jobs and we're enough to pay rent and put groceries and beer in the fridge. 

Fast forward to 2014:

I'm a GM of a restaurant and minority owner of a independently owned offshoot Catering service. Before profit sharing, I bring home around 55k per year, with between 2-4k per year in profits coming my way from the catering division. I would like to invest in the restaurant and delegate more of the catering end off to my staff so I can breath a little and have a bit of a life, as it stands I'm already working between 70-80 hours per week. In addition to the disservice operations, I also teach part time at a culinary school. Bringing in around $185 every two weeks for about 8 hours of my time. 

I've consolidated my federal loans into one large 52k monster at 5.25%, my remaining loans are all below that interest rate (save for the one my mother pays) and are privately held. Between my loans and credit card bills I'm paying around $1300/mo, plus $500 for rent and another $300 in utilities, gas clocks in at $40/mo, and insurance is another $320 (yay government mandates!) 

Not gonna lie here, after buying into the catering company, my remaining savings was wiped out by a health issue, then car trouble, and a cheating/thieving ex-girlfriend. I have a whopping $122 in my silly investment fund and  I have no idea what to do next.

I need somewhere to start, because I feel like I've worked so hard and have nothing to show from it. Again, thank you for at least reading this, and any advice is appreciated!",finance,1411612558
personalfinance,Please take me serious with this user name...,"I've come to personal finance for guidance! I shall give some storyline because I want to get it all out in one shot so that I can post a great story in a few months on how this sub helped me out!


Currently 20 years old turning 21 in a few months.
Just a heads up I am writing this on my phone so grammar may be choppy. Also this is very long.


I messed around after high school and financed a car. (More on my car later) I got laid off from my summer job because the company was terribly managed. I'm 18 at this time. Walk into another company the same day and get hired at $21/h full time great benefits. Well I didn't like waking up at 7AM so screw this. Ive always liked the idea of having lots of money, don't we all, and thought I could be a poker pro. I know trust me it was even more crazy than that sounds... If that's possible. I was living with my SO family (been dating since grade 11) who were definitely not impressed with my choices and I was slowly leaning this. Moved out got my own place, room mate ends up being a huge coke freak and I lose all my stuff. Move back into SO house rent gets bumped $200. Long story short about the casino aspect of my life. I was winning in the poker room and losing on table games. I ended up becoming addicted and was going every night. Made around 15k and was able to pay for expenses and what not until I went crazy and dished off 11k in a weeks time. Realized I needed to a job. 


Guy I met through poker liked my personality as outgoing and talkative. Got me a job at a call centre basically scamming people. Lasted 2 days and was honest with him it wasn't for me. He ended up helping me further this time by getting me a job selling used cars for Kia. Wasn't really doing anything with my life and hated the fact some days I would go to work ""for free"" got into an argument with a manager on a separate shift and quit.


Trying to stay on my feet here, I contacted people and employers. I was able to get into a machine shop as a labourer. 19 years old now and a fresh start. Passed my 3 month probation and was offered an apprenticeship. I very enthusiastically accepted because I was finally moving forward. At this point I have no debt besides that car I had bought out of high school. An 09 Dodge Avenger. Now this is where I may have left myself a very deep hole.


I've finally got a secure job that I like. Unfortunate the timing was about 2 months off for when I got hired and when school registration was so I had to wait a full year before I could start my apprenticeship. I decided my avenger wasn't ""cool"" enough and what not. I bought a 2010 Infinity g37x. Great. I later found out after about 5 months I could not afford the gas this thing was taking. Here I know what will be a great fantastic idea trade this in and finance another car! So that's what I did. The dealerships must love me. I got a brand new 2013 Hyundai Sonata hybrid! Yeah that excitement lasted about 6 months at the most? My payments went up and somehow I am able to afford to keep upgrading my car. My interest rate is prime btw. Paying about 1-2%. I got a couple raises through work, 2$ or so, not a whole lot. Decided I was ready to get into a DIFFERENT cool ride... Wow just typing this is making me cringe. I bought a new 2014 Hyundai Genesis 2.0T. Yes I know I'm young and full of mistakes. I am very upset with myself.


While I was making all this debt my SO on the other hand somehow stayed with me. Easily my best friend in the whole world. I went through a lot of hard times but since I got this job which I've had for a year and a half now we've been great. She comes from a very well off family and is currently in her 3rd year of a degree. Now personalfinance this where I am hoping you all can guide me. I live in Canada. My SO and I have the same dreams and want to move to the states to live out our lives. She will be doing her testing this coming January so she will be eligible to be enrolled down south. We are thinking Texas or California. She will be going to law school. Enough about her for a moment. This got me thinking hey, I can be something too. Machining was never what I wanted to do I just kind of got thrown into it. 


Now this all hit me so fast the last couple weeks. Since I'm going to start my apprenticeship at the end of October, and my SO will be applying for university's only a few months later. I feel I have way too much car debt and I don't make enough money to constantly save huge portions of my paycheques. 


Here is a breakdown of where I am at:
Expenses-
Rent $400/m


Phone $70/m


Car $568/m


Car insurance $330/m


Gas $300/m


Gym membership $50/m


Misc $300/m

Income-


$1300/bw (however this is the very minimum 80 hours, this industry always has overtime and even double time on weekends which is fairly common) my last and upcoming cheques were/will be $1860.


My debt is all in my car which I think is 51k-55k. 
MasterCard is almost always zero however I just preordered iphone 6 so it's currently at -$700.


In my bank account I currently have $10k.


My mom and dad put money away for when I would be going to school. They got divorced and couldn't afford the payments anymore, anyways I just got them to sign the forums and I submitted them off today. Should expect roughly 5.5k..... Definitely not a lot of help if I want to get a degree in the states. But that will be coming to me sooner or later.


My goals are to be well off enough I can support my SO and I in the states. We plan to move July/August 2016. And I would also like to get back into school. 
I think I am finishing my story. 


So I guess I am coming to this sub with a few question:


How can I save money with my current expenses and current timeline.


How much money can I potentially save?


Will I be able to go to the states with my car debt and be eligible for student loans to attend school myself? 


If anything doesn't make sense just let me know and I can provide the information.

robotics,Why is there no robotic rail commuter option in any city?,"We have the software for robotic rail since the 70s.
The engineering isn't anything fancy even if you want it elevated.

A robotic rail commuter train could:  
1) Transport people in a city better than a bus.  
a) You can call it any time-No waiting at a bus stop  
b) There aren't lots of starts and stops  
c) You can rest your eyes and you won't miss your stop  
d) It could expand past the city  
e) More people would use it than buses because of this so there would be more parking available for cars.

2) Robotic rail is better than paying people to deliver to retail/grocery stories.  The things we buy would be cheaper because the logistics would be easier  

3) UPS/FedEx/Postoffice would be redundant when you can send an item via robotic rail to be picked up at their local hub.

Selfdriving cars are hyped by Google, but lets be clear it is hype to promote the brand of Google more than getting something functional soon.  Self driving cars might be 5-20 years down the road and then even in sketechy legal areas depending on what happens.  But right now we could build robotic rail in any city, then it would just expand outward.


Edit:  I didn't mean driver less trains that stay on a closed loop.  I meant one that is composed of pods that routes through different intersections to get to a dynamic destination.  Sorry for the confusion.",technology,1411614330

personalfinance,"Questions about Roth IRA, interest rates, and long term investing.","Hi all,

I just turned 25 and this will be the first year I have money to contribute to my Roth IRA. I did a bunch of reading, but I'm paranoid about my findings and I'm posting here hoping to confirm if all the things I've read and learned are true.

First question: If I contribute to my Roth IRA, does that mean any money I pull out from that account both principle and interest doesn't get taxed at all? 

Seems too good to be true especially if the market does well in my lifetime and I earn a ton of interest.


Second Question: Does the S&amp;P 500 over the long term really average a return of 9-11% per year?

I got that figure from: [here](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html)

And I read this article: [Worlds Worst Market Timer](http://awealthofcommonsense.com/worlds-worst-market-timer/). And In this scenario, a man invests a total of 184k only at the worst possible moments before market crashes and still has a 7% annual return on his 35 year portfolio. Does that mean if I invest regularly and diversity (or just invest in the S&amp;P 500), I can expect an 8-10% average annual return? 

If that's true, I made an excel sheet to do some what-if scenarios and the results look ridiculous. Is this realistic. Am I missing something? Or is this the power of compound interest and starting early?

Excel Sheet: http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=09947288094162257415

Screen shot of excel:http://imgur.com/vjOMs4Z

In the excel sheet, I made the scenario that you start investing at 21, contribute 5500 a year, and get 10% return a year on average. If this is how it works, that means cause I started at 25, I would only save 2.7m by 65 while the person who started at 21 would have 3.9m. Just 4 years and 22000 principle equates to a 1.2m loss for me if we both retire at 65? It seems ridiculous, hence the post here to confirm.

I apologize if all of this is really basic. I'm just trying to wrap my head around it all.",finance,1411617637

I have about $27k under my name, rates around 5.5%.

I have about $45k under my dad's name, rates around 7.5%.

investing,Purchased BABA on margin,"On Monday (09/15) I put in a limit order for 300 shares of BABA at $89.85. Total Order Cost (including commission) was $26,961.95. On Tuesday (09/16) I get a call from ShareBuilder saying that IPOs are not eligible for Margin trading and there is going to be a maintenance/margin call on my account. Apparently this ""system error"" affected only a few people and I was one of the lucky (or unlucky) ones. Here are my options:

1) Deposit $11,184.20 in cash or other eligible securities immediately  otherwise risk having some of shares sold to meet the call. 

2) ShareBuilder is offering to rebill the purchase as 150 shares instead of 300 shares. That is how many shares I would have been able to purchase with my Non-Marginable buying power of $13,568.12. The price would still be $89.85 per share with a $6.95 commission. The only thing that would change is the number of shares purchased. 

3) I can also use only the available cash in my account and not create a loan. I'll end up with 12 shares with this option. 

So I'm turning to you guys for advice on which option I should choose. I'm not exactly sure which one would be the best. How long do I have to meet the maintenance/margin call before ShareBuilder starts selling off my other shares? Margin Interest rate is 7.50%.

personalfinance,"Went to a Financial Planner yesterday, he seemed super sketchy: is this normal?","I went to a Financial Planner yesterday and honestly he really sketched me out. Maybe I had the wrong expectations, but I'd love to know if these are red flags or not :

1.) He talked for an HOUR AND A HALF non-stop about how awesome he was, all the money he makes people, yadda yadda. I couldn't get a word in. Really felt like a hard sell. Something about the fact that he felt the deep need to impress me like this felt like it was a scam.

2.) He seems to think he can beat the market or at least ""time"" the market. He just kept talking about how he's really good at investing money. I've always thought that rule is that nobody can beat the market and you're always better putting your money in no fee index funds. Isn't that correct? I wanted a financial planner not a stock broker.

3.) He wanted to invest my money through a company that he works for. Like I brought up Vanguard and he said that he would much rather use the company that he has ties to called IAA. Again, I wanted a neutral party not someone who was tied to a brokerage company.

4.) He also wanted me to do an annual plan with him where I'd go to see him quarterly and he wanted to control my investments. 

5.) His suit fit incredibly badly. I know this is superficial, but he had a sad salesman kind of vibe. His jacket sleeves were like 3 inches too short no joke.

6.) He actually worked ON Wall St. in an incredibly weird building with like 100 offices where there were clearly one on one meetings like mine happening all over. Felt kinda like these guys were renting there so they could have the ""prestige"" of a ""Wall St. office."" The whole thing had a sketchy vibe.

In the end I was able to convince him that all I wanted was ADVICE (this is after 2 hours). That I needed to know how to diversify my investments into index funds, that I needed to know how much of my student loans to pay off, and how to do my taxes in a better way. He agreed to help me with this stuff for $650... seems really steep, but this is NYC and it seems close to what another FP quoted me.

Anyway, this guy came highly recommended, but it just feels wrong. Should I cancel our appointment tomorrow or am I being paranoid?

My actual situation is this : I've got about $100,000 saved up that I need to do something with besides let rot in a bank account. I'm a freelancer so I don't have a 401K. I also don't want to put my money into an investment that I can't take out until retirement. I have grandiose plans of being an artist and I may want to live off this money for a while / do something entrepreneurial with it. I'm looking for something that's a safe investment over 5 years. I also have $50k in Student Loans with interest rates ranging from 2 - 5%.

I'm thinking about opening my first investment account ever. I have a little bit of savings and a modest salary, and I feel comfortable investing a couple hundred dollars every month. The thing holding me back so far has been the initial deposit of $3000 but I'm getting close to where I'll have enough savings to make that deposit and still have my emergency fund available.

I'm a sporadic /r/personalfinance reader and from what I've picked up, I think I should open an IRA account and contribute a little bit every month in an attempt to max out the annual limit. Is that right? Should I even be investing yet? Here's my situation....

**Debt:** 

Student loans and mortgage

* $12k private student loans at 4.5%, 5%, and 6%, making minimum payments
* $25k federal student loans at 5.1%, 6.3%, and 6.55%, making minimum payments (Note: I'm going for public service loan forgiveness after 10 years. Working in government now, plan to stay here or move to non-profit for the next 7 years. Paying minimum so that I can have as much forgiven as possible.)
* $190k mortgage at 3.25%, making minimum payments

I know that my mortgage is a ""good"" debt and I don't need to pay it off before investing. The federal student loan debt I'm making minimum payments on since I'm going for PSLF. The only debt that might need to be paid off before investing would be the private student loans, but the interest rate are fairly low and I've heard 7% as an avg return so wouldn't it make more sense for me to invest than to pay off those loans? I set my payments to go automatically, and I only reevaluate my finances every couple months, so the psychological benefit of paying off loans will probably not affect me. I just want the most logical plan.

My employer does not offer any matching, but I do have a mandatory pension that I'm paying the minimum towards. I'll become vested I think after 5 years, possibly 10, but I'm hoping not to stay here the rest of my life so I'm not counting this to be much of a retirement income.

What do you think? Should I be paying my private loans off before even considering investing in anything? Are the interest rates low enough that I could use my extra income for investing? 

If it makes more sense to invest, how should I start? I have a Vanguard account set up and when I've researched this before, I was leaning towards some sort of index fund, held in a Roth IRA, but I don't think I ever decided if Roth would be better for me than Traditional, or if there's a different account I should be using.

Skip ahead if you don't want to know the back story. At age 15 I began at the university for a BS in elementary education (I'm sure there's some irony in that). I'm now soon graduating with an MS in educational technology. Neither of these degrees I have ever wanted. My father ""made"" me do these and at the age of 15 I could do little to argue. Now at 20, soon to be 21, I've finished my father's ""plan"". Except I have never never never wanted to be a teacher and still don't. So you can say that my degrees are utterly useless. Because my loving dad set up every last bit of my college, I never knew what I was signing. Several things he wouldn't even tell me and if I asked he'd be mad. 

So in the end I signed up for several loans from the feds and now owe 60k. I don't know the interest rates but if anyone could tell me how I'd love to find out.

What do I do? I work a part time job which pays me roughly 450 a month. Next semester I'm supposed to be a philosophy teacher at a community college but its just talk so far.

Income monthly is $4320 or so. Total of two adults, a dog, and three cats to keep alive. I'm putting 6% in to 401k, which is 100% matched. Otherwise no savings, obviously.  
  
So, I'm having a heart attack. The student loans come due next month.

Right now I'm working about an extra ten hours a week, but I didn't include that as its variable.  
  
My plan right now is to pay off the credit cards to free up some dollars monthly, and then pay off that personal loan, as even though its 0% from a family member, it is a large payment but not a lot of principal. I also want to sell that rv if I can and I'd get rid of that second car if I could but I'm under it by about 4k  
  
I feel sufficiently awful about being such an idiot with money up until now. Feel free to meet me know at length how stupid I am though, as I deserve it.   
  
I've thought about just foregoing paying the student loans indefinitely and let then ruin my credit, as I don't need credit for anything. I know they would garnish my wages but last time that happened it was at a maximum of 10% of my pay.  
  
Can't even file for bankruptcy on the other stuff as I already went bankrupt back in 2012 due to having no job. I finally found a good paying job, went overboard as I finally had money for the first time in my life, and now I feel like I've ruined not only my life, but that of my wife and potential children.

It was spent on some academically related expenses, and some stupid purchases. This was stupid, I know, but I've learned my lesson and I can't wait to pay it off. 

I also have student loan debt, a mixture of private loans ($33k) and federal loans ($26k). They are current and I'm paying the minimum each month. The average interest here is 6.8%

Since I achieved my latest position (~32k/year), I've been in the financial position to start paying down my personal debt, and I've been paying on these credit cards monthly, and have made some progress, but it is slow-going, my credit score is also pretty horrible because of my debt/available debt ratio, and I somehow missed a random student loan that went into default for ~6 months. I haven't used these cards since I got my latest position 18 months ago, and I'm now current on all my bills.

I'm also in grad school, and my company pays tuition for one class per term but doesn't cover fees/books, so I've been taking a class per semester to take advantage of this, once I have my MA, I'll be able to move up, the job I have now is very stable. This semester, I applied for FAFSA because I was thinking of taking two classes/semester to get it done quicker, and I just noticed today that I have a FinAid package of around $20k for this semester and next. 

I was thinking about accepting the $20k at a ~6.8% interest rate and doing a few things:

1. Paying for the extra classes for the next two semesters. ($5k) This will allow me to complete my coursework at least a year sooner, and I could move on to a higher paying position sooner.

2. Paying off my credit cards. ($7.5k)

3. Use the remainder to pay off the highest interest student loans.

My thought process is that these would be at a much lower interest rate, and I would be able to focus on aggressively paying down student loans, and save/invest.

personalfinance,Struggling to Make it Through College. Loan problems... help?,"I'm sorry for the long read..

I’ve been struggling for the past two years in order to get into college. I applied my senior year of high school to a bunch of places I wanted to go to for a B.A., but then the schools didn’t give me as much financial aid as I had hoped for and I had to make a major change and find a cheaper school. 

The school I am currently attending is an online course that costs around $12,000 per year in tuition, and I am going for and Associates in Science now so it will only be two years - $24,000… the issue is, though, that I have $0 in savings for college, and my parents have terrible credit, and are in so much debt couldn’t help me pay even if they wanted to. I currently have a great credit score, somewhere around 730, but the issue is I don’t make enough money to take out loans by myself. I talked to a banker and they said if I made $12,000 per year or more, with my score I should have no problem getting a loan. 

I currently work at Burger King, so I get $9,000 per year if I’m lucky. I was considering getting another part time job in order to make the extra money, but I don’t have a car and rely on my Dad to get me back and forth to Burger King as it is and even then I have a hard time being able to do it because of the way my Dad’s work schedule works. I wanted to get a car, but there’s the same issue. I tried going to buy a car recently, but they said I didn’t make enough, I haven’t had my job for long enough (Ive only been working at BK for a month), and I have no down payment saved. I decided to enroll in the online course for the first semester because they gave me federal loans to cover it. I asked them if I could take out an extra $2,000 for “educational costs” which I plan on using as my down payment for the car, but I won’t get that until November… which is scarily close to the end of the semester. 

I asked all of my relatives and my boyfriend’s parents to cosign on my loans, but they all said no. The only people willing to cosign for me are my parents, but their credit is so bad I’m afraid it would hurt me more than help me- if do anything at all. I tried advertising to hire a cosigner because I was so desperate, but people either said I was a loony or they wanted me to split the loan with them for even more money than the banks allow me to take out. I really don’t know what to do. I asked the car dealer what if I managed to get a second part time job (getting desperate enough to walk 10 miles per day, that is) and they said that I would need a cosigner no matter what because of how young I am… and I assume the student loans will be the same. Now I’m enrolled in the course and not getting these loans means dropping out, and even if I did drop out.. What options would I have? Keep working at Burger King living with my parents for years? I don’t want a life like that. I need to get out of here.

Here's my story. I'm 25, currently working for a non-profit social services agency in a management role that I deem to be a pretty solid job for someone my age and stage. I graduated with an out-of-state bill and a degree in Sociology from a state school (UVM) and am now paying off my loans and trying to figure out my longer-term financial plans as I prepare for the next steps in life. 

My basic goals are to pay off my student debt on a reasonable timeline while contributing a reasonable amount to retirement savings, saving up towards a real-estate down payment, and having enough disposable income to get by. I've built a solid emergency fund and have a few ideas about some strategies for managing my debt, and so far have been able to keep up with monthly payments with some help from my father. 

Here's my numbers:


Income: $42,000

Take Home: ~$2400 after taxes (currently my w4 is filed for 0 exemptions) and with 3% going into a 403(b)

403 (b): $2195 (Employer always contributes 3%, I add another 3% currently)

Health Insurance: still on my parents (till I'm 26)

Rent: $500/month

Utilities: ~$60/month

Car: $0 Paid off, parents pay insurance, and reimbursed for miles driven at work :-)

Other expenses: sometimes a hefty bar tab or two, trying to reel that in, cigs @ about $10 every 2 days :-/


Savings: 

Emergency Fund: $5,000

Cash on hand: ~$2,000


Investments:

Fidelity UTMA: ~$1200 (mutual funds)

Janus UTMA: ~$2400 (mutual funds)


The Bills:

Sallie Mae: ~$115,000; 3 loans ranging from 4.5-4.88% (12 years left out of 15), minimum monthly payment of $1033

Dept of Education: $3654 @ 4.25% and $2274 @ 4.55% - combined minimum of $83/mo

VSAC (federal loan) $3,328 @ 6.8% - minimum is $52/mo

Total Loan Payment Monthly: $1168

Dad's contribution: $500/month

My net payment: $668


Sooo here are my thoughts:

I'd like to pay off the smallest loan in the next three months. I plan to do this by reducing my expenses and putting any extra $$ towards the payments. With that gone, I'll next tack that payment amount onto the DOE loans and hope to work those down.


Regarding the Sallie Mae loan, one option I have is to extend the loan term to 30 years, lowering the monthly payment to $660 or so. I'd rather not do this, but the interest rate doesn't change and this would free up some serious capital for investment and saving. Would this affect my credit score? 


I'd ideally like to have about $20k in the bank/invested by the time I'm 30, figuring that I'll ultimately want to buy a house around that time. I'd love to go to grad school for an MBA, but with my current financial situation I see no way to finance that without more loans and... I'm not up for that.


My main questions are: Should I cash out on my investments now to pay off the little loans, or should I pay out of my income and save those for later? Is it worth extending the Sallie Mae loan to free up capital for saving or investing? Should I bother investing/saving at all, or just focus on paying these bills given that I've built an emergency fund?

personalfinance,Does my 30 to 15 year mortgage refinance analysis check out?,"My current mortgage began 3/1/2010, $112,900 at 5%, balance of $104,700.  We are currently paying $1000 per month PITI because of an escrow shortage last year.  On 12/1, payment is going down to $885, the normal amount, which includes $47 per month in PMI.

I'm considering a refinance into a 15 year, 3.2% on $106k (rolling in the $2k ish closing costs), $400 out of pocket for an appraisal.  Monthly payment would be $978.

I'm doing a cost/benefit analysis of the refi based on what cash we'll have left over after a sale to put towards the next house, and, assuming a future sale in June 2020 at $138k (after Realtor commission and taxes), am considering three options:

* keep current mortgage and save the $120 per month we gain in December:  mortgage balance $91k, $8.8k in the bank, for a net down payment of $55.8k

* keep current mortgage, put extra $120 towards it like we're used to:  mortgage balance $82k for a downpayment of $56k

* refinance into the 15 year: mortgage balance $72k for a downpayment of $66k.

So it seems by reducing our interest rate and using the house essentially as a forced savings account we'll have $10k more for a future down payment if we refinance than if we didn't, and it won't be any ""harder"" than what we're used to, since we've been paying more than normal for the past year with no issue.

Less tangible benefits are refi gets rid of the PMI and adds my spouse to the deed and mortgage (currently only in my name).

I've been shuffling through the FAQ and every other thing I can think of for days now, but I'm either not understanding or just can't find the more specific information I'm looking for. :)

Basically, all told, we have our car which is about $15K worth of debt (at a heinous loan shark interest rate), and ~$15K worth of collection debt. We have no credit cards or anything else, just the car and collections. We also have credit scores in the 520ish range, which basically explains the above.

Over the last couple months, I've been using the information in this subreddit (and others) to get a hold on things. We've been napkin math, negative bank account spenders for way too long. My goals for the short term are:

1. Setup a feasible budget to keep us from giving the bank ~$1500 a year in overdraft fees (I shit you not)
2. Get ahead at least a full month on income (this includes cutting everything I can to make this happen as quickly as is feasible)
3. Pay off the collections, with the end goal being getting a lower interest rate loan on our car, and be able to qualify for a home

Because of the information here, I've got a reasonable grasp on how to achieve 1 and 2. Where I'm still a little lost is 3. I read the long (and very informative) post on collections, but I was hoping for more specifics on dealing with them, specifically regarding feasible strategies for maybe working down the total amounts (questions to ask, and the like), and how to actually going about paying it once I've done so... Put money into an account to pay bigger ones first, clear them off in reverse... The amounts have been static for a long time, so interest doesn't seem to be a factor.

The problem is it seems to create a chicken and egg scenario; I'm under the impression from the ancient past that collector's usually only negotiate when you already have money you're going to give them, but not knowing how much I need short of possibly spending way longer than necessary with bad credit saving for an amount I might not need sounds...

The problem I'm having is that my smallest balances are same-as-cash deals on some store credit cards.  I can take another year to pay off my grill (worth every penny!!!) and I have 4 years to pay off my new bed (needed a new one for my bad back).  If I start doing the debt snowball does it defeat the purpose if I'm not doing these right away?  And to be honest my credit cards have a much higher balance and rate than my school loans and my new-ish car.

personalfinance,25 y.o media professional doing tax return tomorrow. Any advice/suggestions? (AU),"I'm a 25 y/o female professional. I work at a media station, not as a personality but within the advertising/sales/production fields.  

Admittedly, I don't have much experience with taxes.

I'm doing my taxes tomorrow (I haven't done it in two years - which was the first time I'd claimed anything - mybad) and was wondering if anyone had any advice on what I can claim/things I might not have thought of. 

This is all I can think of so far - feel free to correct me, I'm all ears.
I don't know much about Tax laws, admittedly I've only ever done my taxes once two years ago - so I'm going back to the same accountant (so bear with me at how daft this may sound but I figure throw it out there and ask):

- Aside from being in the office, I'm on call, so I figured I could try and claim on my computer, tablet and printer.

- Being on call and constantly on email, I'll see if I can claim something on my phone bill, which is $70 a month

- Business attire and makeup? There's a standard, though I've read someplaces cosmetics and general attire can't be claimed.

- Dry cleaning (300) and/or laundry (150 i think you can claim without receipts. I don't necessarily have receipts, I use this lovely korean drycleaner down my street when I get sick of rolling cat fur off my clothes.



Things I'm not so sure of:
- I last did my tax with an accountant two years ago. 
Am I no longer allowed to claim that (as a tax agent claim) because it's late?

- Car. 
I drive to and from, but also if something happens at the station, I have to drive in at any hour of the night (which happens once or twice a month, thank goodness). 
Are car expenses e.g. repairs, service, tyres attainable for tax claim for me do you think?

- Newspaper and magazine subscriptions. I work in media advertising. Do you know if I can make a claim re: these, as I have to stay across e.g. government announcements if I'm working on putting advertising to air for Fed Govt and something in the political climate dramatically changes overnight?

If you have any suggestions or additions or even advice - I'd really appreciate the feedback :)",finance,1411736397

personalfinance,Is now a good time for me to buy land?,"**Question:**
I have always had the dream of owning a few acres of land near a forest to build a cabin or vacation home on. I want to know if you think now is a good time for me to buy some land, with the hopes of building on it later.

    
**About Me:**
I'm 26, married, with a 1 year old kid.  Gross household income is about 100,000. I have a mortgage of $150,000 on a $170,000 house with an interest rate of 3.25%.  I have student loans of $8,000 with an interest rate of 6.8% (i pay extra on these every month). I have a car loan of $9,000 at 1.99%.  I contribute 6% to retirement which my employer matches 50% of. I have $8,000 in savings.

**Details on Land:**
I would want to purchase land approximately 2 hours away from my primary residence for less than $30,000.  I live in the Baltimore, MD area and there are plenty of options in this price range in WV, PA, and VA.  In the short term we would use this land for camping (tents/ camper).  In the long term we would want to build a cabin on the property.


Would it be a horrible financial decision to get another mortgage on land right now? I know my priorities should be the high interest student loans, savings, and retirement but I wanted to get some additional opinions.

personalfinance,Should I Put Excess Student Loan Money in a Mutual Fund to Compensate for Interest Charges?,"/r/personalfinance, I'm in need of some financial advice on how to use my excess student loan money to my advantage while still in school. I currently have a starter mutual fund with around $1000 in it. I was thinking of keeping that one as is, with month payments still going in, while opening one or two more mutual fund or money market accounts that are of a more aggressive style. I have about $1000 to play around with to still keep a nice buffer for my bills and other expenses that the bulk off the loan money will be going toward. 

All-in-all, I'm trying to find a little loop hole that will help me counteract some of the interest rates that will build up over time. If it matters, I will be in school for the next 5-10 years, which means that the interest rates wont start until after that time. However, the more money I can make from what I already have, the less likely it will be that I will need to take out more loan money from this company in the future before I get into a graduate program. 

tl;dr: What mutual fund(s) do you recommend I put $500-$1000 into, to turn a profit in a short amount of time with minimal risk?

I have never really dealt with a large sum of money before. I am a college student, on track to graduate in either May or December of next year. I have, as of last week, about ~6k in savings that I've slowly accumulated throughout college. My tuition debts will come out to [guessing since the graduation date isn't set] ~30k or less. 

I got a call from a lawyer a couple days ago, saying that a massive chunk of land a relative owned is being sold, and after various deductions (but no tax), I would get just over $14,000. I have never had this much money at once, and I have no intention of spending it. 

To clarify, I haven't physically received the inheritance, but the lawyer estimated about 30 days, but even if it is 90 days, it makes no difference to me. My real question is: What is the most financially responsible thing I can do with this money? If I put it toward tuition, would that save on interest in the future? Or are those interest rates set in stone, regardless of the number of years it takes me to pay it off? Is there any particular account I could put the money into to help accumulate interest, or anything like that? Sorry if these seem like foolish questions.

personalfinance,Looking for short and long term advice on my budget after moving!,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for some advice from the community.

The numbers I'm looking at are [THESE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A7I-MdC-AZ4c2kLKifpW3AqjQgO2pYgBZAr-s1te8f4/pubhtml).



I recently moved states and my living expenses are jumping more than I had hoped for.  I have started a 2nd job on my own schedule which should help my flexibility as I can work it as much as I want for about $12-20/hr.  I usually get a few hours of overtime from my primary employer per bi-weekly check, but I don't want to rely on that as it is not guaranteed.  I also make quarterly bonuses of anywhere from 0 to $800.  I should (knock on wood) get a bonus of about $5-600 at the end of October, but again I don't want to bank on it.

I am currently staying in a furnished room my brother has available, but this is a short term deal; I need to get out pretty soon.  I am hoping to have my own place in the next 4 weeks.  The rent price will be about $720 + water/etc.  The deposit will be a month's rent more than likely.  There is also an application fee of $150.  So my move-in expense is about $1600.

Today is payday, so my cash balances will be at about $400 after bills are paid (not including food and gas for the next 2 weeks).

My credit score has been in flux.  I have been working on it for 2 years, built it up from 550 to 670. I then dumped my predatory Drive Time car loan and rolled the negative equity into my current loan at half the interest rate.  This may have been a mistake as despite my payments going more towards equity, the payment went up $130/month and my debt to income ratio is starting to hurt.

My current credit is now about 600 :(.  

My short term thoughts are to take out a $5000-6000 loan from a place like One Main Financial to consolidate the 4 high interest cards ($3500) and use the rest for moving expenses/breathing room.  The next step is to pump in as many hours as I can into my 2nd job as I can work it as much as I want.  I am fully prepared to have a predatory rate on this if I can get approved.

My mid term goals are to pay off the debt, build my credit score, and refinance or trade in my car to something more manageable.

My long term goals are to build credit/wealth and position myself to buy a house in maybe 2-3 years.


1. I am looking for input on many different aspects.  If anyone has any strategies they think would benefit me I would love to hear them.
1. If anyone has feedback on institutions that are willing to loan to my situation without being complete predators, I REALLY would like to hear about these. 
1. I am currently contributing 6% pre-tax to my 401k as it is matched by my employer.  Should I stop this until I'm back on track?

So, I've decided to get a bit of an upgrade; please don't focus on that part of the decision, only on the financing aspects of this.

I currently invest a chunk of each paycheck into after-tax retirement accounts.  I've already done everything in the FAQ prior to contributing money to taxable accounts, so don't worry about that.  This comes down to a question of opportunity cost...

My options:

1. I could cash a significant chunk of my taxable investments out to come pretty close to buying the car outright.
1. I could not touch my current investments, make approximately a 20-30% down payment on the car with savings, selling my existing car, etc...and take out a loan

I psychologically dislike debt, as I haven't had any for about 5 years now, but at the same time, I'm not someone that will fret over it, so if it makes financial sense, I'm 100% fine with it.  I'm thinking given current interest rates for car loans, that it really makes financial sense for me to get a loan and continue to invest part of each paycheck, while putting the other part towards the loan.  I'd say it'll probably cut my after-tax investments roughly in half.

My loan options:

1. 1.49% for a 3 year loan
1. 1.99% for a 5 year loan

My thinking on the market here is fairly similar.  I'm thinking the extra 0.5% isn't that big of a difference, and that's an extra 2 years that I could be investing more money every month as opposed to trying to pay the loan down sooner...

Is my thinking here sound?  I'm thinking financially that a 1.99% loan over 5 years makes the most sense, as it will allow me to continue to invest the most money every month in the market....am I missing anything?",finance,1411775977

Looking at a bank for a loan quotation for 34 years (until retirement), I notice I will end up paying the bank 111K.

I can pay much more than monthly rate the bank quoted for me. Should I go for 
a) paying the loan in approx 8 years but paying high monthly installments (one third of my monthly salary)? or

personalfinance,Need help calculating interest on a personal loan (CA),"I am not financial savvy and need some help figuring out how much interest I owe on a $10,000 personal loan. 

I borrowed this money from a family friend off their line of credit. They told me I have to pay it back within 3 years, and the interest rate is 6%. 

They started spending money on the line of credit and now we can't figure out how much interest I owe. If it's is 6% on 10,000, then obviously my interest would be $600. But here's where the confusion is. If I pay a certain amount of money each month, wouldn't my interest payments be going down over the years? I do not understand how this works and want to make sure I don't overpay.

This is the breakdown of my payments: 

April 2012- Sept 2012- I paid $500/month.
October 2012-Sept 2014- I paid $300/month.

I guess the bank noticed because I got pre-approved for a credit line, of up to $25,000 at 7.15%.

* Unsubsidized	$7,000	3.86%
* Unsubsidized	$4,000	6.8%

Additionally, I just found out that I have a whole lot of bonds that are matured or are maturing soon. All together, they would be slightly more than 6200. 
I have 11K in my savings account, which is my 'emergency fund' (probably 6-8months of expenses). I do have 2k in my checking also, which is helping to get me through school/ books as I only work part-time while I study.

I had a set schedule (9-5), used company equipment entirely, and was given specific instructions on what to do, when to do it, and how to do it - meaning I wasn't really a contractor. They finally hired me (full time, benefits, etc) this year.

I found out more recently that this was illegal, and they were just avoiding paying taxes etc. on employing me. I was young (still am) and didn't save the money for taxes or file them (not to mention at what I was getting paid, it was tough to save). I am trying to get a handle on this now, and I know the IRS will work with you to get their money since that's what they care about. I don't own a car or a house, and have no tangible assets for them to go after anyway. I do however have fantastic credit (loans and credit cards always on time) and I'd like to avoid screwing that up somehow with this.

I made $38,000 over two years, which puts me into the 15% federal tax bracket. That's $5700 (plus whatever fees the IRS wants to pile on). I don't want to go after the employer because unfortunately, it's a stable job now and I have benefits.

I'm totally aware I messed up, and I'm trying to make it right. Feel free to lecture anyway.

My boyfriend makes about twice as much as me but we share a bank account and all finances, so we have quite a bit more in the bank than I could have possibly contributed. I'm concerned that once I file my taxes and try to work out a deal with them to pay the money I owe (payment plan based on my finances), they'll look at our bank account and just say ""there's enough in there to cover it, we'll just take that"", take my boyfriend's money and refuse to work with me. Also, I don't know if it matters but the account was originally only his. I was added on to it later.

Just a note - he's completely aware of this entire situation and is alright with it. (As alright as you can be on this, he's not upset with me though)

One thought I had was to separate our finances now, before I file taxes. Remove my name from his bank account, get my paychecks deposited into my own bank account with just my name on it so they can see my actual finances after splitting costs of living with my boyfriend.
However, I'm aware that the IRS can just look at my banking history and see what my boyfriend has in the bank and go after that (because it was 'our' account for years) instead of working out a deal with me. I'm also worried that they'll think I'm trying to hide 'my' money from them if I drop myself from his bank account.

worldpolitics,"Part 1. Russia sanctions, implementing client sanctions policies. Skala Law client update.","Part 1.  Russia sanctions, implementing client sanctions policies.  Skala Law client update.

Sanctions’ impact will worsen through 2015.  Failing to understand sanctions’ purpose and enforcement materially and avoidably damages listed and unlisted entities.  Lack of a sanctions policy renders entities noncompetitive in tenders and direct foreign sales, cripples their foreign affiliates, ability to secure funding, procure equipment and disposables.  Failure to implement a viable sanctions policy is seen as responsible for the recent arrest of Euro 30,000,000 of Arkady Rotenberg’s property in Italy.

The author:  Mr. Backer is an American attorney, with a residence in Moscow, his sanctions experience began 20 years ago as a U.S. government attorney advising on enforcement of investment and technology transfer as to the Former Soviet Union’s energy sector.

Sanctions excel at damaging business and individuals, but lack a track record of achieving the goal of changing a sanctioned government’s policies.  See Cuba, Belarus, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc.  Unlike laws and regulations meant to create fair and predictable rules, sanctions are explicitly intended to maximize collateral damage and lack clear, developed enforcement standards.

A person or a company doesn’t have to be listed, i.e. explicitly identified by OFAC or other responsible agency as a subject of a sanction regime, to lose their business. 

If you sell, buy or invest to or from a sanctioned state, either implement a sanctions policy or look to prayer, wishful thinking, willful ignorance and indignation.  Some plan for an emergency, others let the prayer wheel, energy crystals and the dream catcher do the heavy lifting.  Historically, a favorite is doing nothing and then airing your laundry in the local press.

Sanctions enforcement is very complex, highly punitive and often retroactive.  Somewhat ironically, sanctions may cause the greatest damage to unlisted businesses.  G. Gref, the head of Sberbank had a rather telling quote on sanctions:  it doesn’t really matter what is written in sanctions, everything in reality is much worse.

A lack of a sanctions policy leads many (most?) potential commercial and financial counter-parties to refuse to transact with or offer fair terms to companies linked to a sanctioned country.  Unlisted Russian companies have seen the collapse of their daughter and affiliated company revenues in North America and Europe.

What is the impact on an unlisted company’s business if a party believes that alternate dispute resolution will not function, correspondent accounts may be frozen or that their insurance won’t cover them?

An example: an unlisted sanctioned country business participates in a tender to sell manufacturing or power generation equipment or widgets to a EU company.  The documentation is tender compliant and the cost/value advantage over competitors is 15%.  Lacking a sanctions policy, the prospective client’s risk management department advises that the chance of correspondent accounts being frozen is about 10%, of adoption of applicable sectoral sanctions 10%, of listing 10% and of shipping restrictions is 10%, etc.  
The advantage is gone; the bid will never see daylight.  All without any negative client feedback as to the goods offered or the tender documentation.  Costs and opportunity wasted.

Sanctions policies enable unlisted companies to transact and for listed entities to optimize their posture as to sanctions.  If you or your companies are listed, the time to seek remedy such as listing removal in most sanction regimes is severely limited.  In the U.K., the time limit to act is 60 days.

Sanctions have extremely broad reach.  U.S. sanctions apply to every U.S. national everywhere.  What is the impact on a Chinese or Canadian company with a U.S. person as a principal officer or owner?
Sanctions occupy an unusual legal position, it is expressly violative to try to “circumvent” their provisions.  EU 208/2014:  “… prohibited to participate, knowingly and inten¬tionally, in activities the object or effect of which is to circumvent the measures referred to in Article 2.”
Sanction are very fluid and complex.  From 2/2014 to 8/2014, OFAC updated over 20(!) separate sanctions programs.  OFAC is only one U.S. government entity administering sanctions.  Multiply that across the many implementing nations and agencies.  EU sanctions are applied by each individual member state under their own laws.

Absent a sanctions policy, something that is perfectly legal to sell from nation A, may be arrested in transit in nation B or payment frozen in nation C.  An act may be punishable as a felony in one EU member state and as an administrative violation in another.

Sanctions are very difficult to cancel.  Sanctions against the Russian Federation expressly reference Crimea.  Likely, they cannot be mitigated or cancelled until Crimea is reincorporated in Ukraine.  Most commentators do not see reincorporation as likely.

Sanctions don’t function the way that people think they do.  As emergency measures, sanctions are drafted extremely broadly and lack clarity.  Persons and companies may be subject to sanctions without awareness that they apply to them.  New sanction regimes lack clarification, commentary and history of application needed to make them predictable.  Sanction regime application differs between nations and sometimes between agencies within a nation.

Sanctions impose severe challenges for legal professionals, particularly law firms seeking business with sanctioning governments.  What happens when a sanctioned entity is a E500,000 client to a French law firm while the government seeking confidential information to enforce its sanctions is a E20,000,000 client?

Can a listed company secure counsel within the sanctioning jurisdictions and get tangible benefit from this representation?  Can frozen funds can be used to pay for legal services?  Yes, yes and a qualified yes.

personalfinance,Chase Freedom Interest Question,"Hello /r/personalfinance

I have a basic question on interest accrual.  I already sent an inquiry to Chase, however while I wait for a response I was interested to see what answers I might get from /r/personalfinance as I may just be misunderstanding the interest charges.

I have a Chase Freedom credit card that I use for online purchases then pay off right away.  Typically I don't receive interest on my payments, but that's because I pay my card off before a statement is issued.  So each statement is ""0.00"" balance and ""0.00"" due.

However, I made a purchase with a total of 1177.65 shortly before a statement was issued.  My statement came through, with the balance due.  The due date was 9/23.

On 9/17 I paid the card off in full.  So by the due date, the balance was 0.00 - however on 9/26 I received an interest charge of 7.60.

My wifes credit card was the same thing.  A Chase Freedom card under her name, she made an online purchase for a little over 800.  We paid it off in full 13 days before the statement due date but she received an interest charge on the next statement.

Both interest charges are small, so I don't care about the cost I was just curious on why it happened.  Since it's rare my card has a balance by the time a statement is issued, I may have just had a misunderstanding of the card itself.  But my understanding is that interest is due on the balance if not paid in full by the end of the statement (e.g. if you pay the minimum).  But it appears that I am charged interest even though I paid it off.

Any input is appreciated.

**Update:** Chase got back to me, it was an error on their part.  It was just odd that it happened to both my card and my wifes card so I assumed there was more to it.  The % was also a red flag because it was about 0.6% of the statement balance, so it wasn't even close the typical credit card interest rates.",finance,1411826362

personalfinance,Need some student loan advice :),"Hi all,

I am 3 years out of college and recently married. My husband is in the military, so we have recently switched over most of our finances to USAA (yay!). When we got married, this was my student loan situation (husband is debt-free):

**Three private loans**

~$25,000
 
~$15,000

~$3,500

**One (consolidated) federal loan**

~$15,000


USAA offers a ""new officer"" loan of $25,000 at a great rate, so we took out that loan and paid off the first private loan. Then, since we had some money in the bank, we went ahead and paid off the $3,500 loan as well.

Now, we still probably have around $10,000 in savings, he has a reasonably sized brokerage account (almost $20,000) and could scrape up another $5,000 reasonably easily. Should we go ahead and pay off that last $15,000 private loan ASAP? (I feel like this might be a no-brainer, but it would leave us with no real savings, other than the brokerage, which we really don't want to dip into more than we have to.)

Also, I have to keep reminding myself that the $25,000 loan isn't GONE, even though it feels like it since I don't have to pay it to MEFA anymore!

**ALSO:** I just started getting my Experian credit report through USAA (real score, not FAKO score), and I'm wondering why it would still tell me I have 8 current installment loans when I should, at this point, only be showing 2.

Is there anything I can do to prove to them that I don't actually have that many loans currently open?

They also subsidize my rent by 200/month (I pay 350 of a 1100 rent and they pay her 550). This will also stop after her graduation.

I am really grateful for the help her parents have given and I have already started to plan to meet the increased cost. But it has kind of thrown a wrench into my strategy to eliminate my debts and start an emergency fund/invest

So here's where I stand now:     
     
I'm still massively in debt, but i've sort of re-organized and re-ordered everything. What I'm asking is mostly advice on whether or not my current budget is the proper way to attack the problem, or if I should tackle my debt in a different order.     
      
I should note ahead of time that my credit is already pretty much screwed, and I'm not terribly worried about it at the present moment, as it will be many years before I'm ready to look for a house or a second car. I am simply looking at the most logical way to approach my debt. Right now, my repayment schedules run until January of 2017, and that will leave me completely debt free.      
     
Right now, my immediate pressing issue is to rectify all of these payday loans I have taken out, stupidly, over the last year. These loans carry such a high interest rate that I have paid the $300 original loan several times over now in ""fees"", so they are my priority to eliminate. A quick look through my history will show that a user from /r/Borrow has loaned me enough money to pay off the payday loans and stop the fees, and I will simply re-pay him the total of the debts. This should take until Feb 2015.

This will leave me with my Car Loan (which will be, by my calculations, around $10,000-ish payoff quote.) and my credit debt (around $11,000 total, though fees and interest will accrue until these debts are written off and put into collections.)      
     
So my question basically becomes, should I focus on paying off the credit debt first, as it will all be moving to collection statuses (which impact my credit, but it's borked anyway.) as my car loan will simply continue as scheduled and not go ""late"", or should I focus on paying off the car loan, so that I own the car outright, and don't have to worry about repossession, and then focus on my credit card debt?      
     
I'm not looking for negative or mocking responses, so i'd prefer it if you would not post if you have something negative to post. I understand I'm $20k+ in debt. I understand I make plenty of money to pay these debts. I understand I have been extremely irresponsible this last year and have absolutely no excuse for my behavior.      
     
But I'm trying to change. I have to change. Something has to change. And now, finally, i'm willing to make those changes. I'm willing to make sacrifices. I am finally ready, I think, to accept responsibility for my finances. I have come to realize that I will never get out of this cycle if I don't make these changes. So. Again. Should I tackle my credit card debt, or should I tackle my car loan? In the end, as long as I stick to my budget, I should be completely debt free by Feb 2017. After that, it's gravy. I should be making/saving $1100/month (and at the moment, the plan is saving, until i've saved until January 2018. That will give me a hell of a buffer in case of emergencies.) in extra income, while still being able to pay my bills as they pop up monthly.     
     
I think this is a workable solution, I am just wondering which is more beneficial to tackle first.",finance,1411841003
personalfinance,Steep jump in income -- am I planning to do it right?,"Hi, all. I received a fantastic job offer that comes complete with a fantastic raise at a new company. I accepted and have already called my CPA / tax guy to talk about immediate and 2015 tax year ramifications. All is good from his perspective, and he assured me I'm on the right track, retirement-wise.

I've also read the FAQ, and want to make sure I'm not leaving any stone unturned with my plans -- I have to admit that much of this is new to me due to the jump in income, and I feel a bit like I'm out of my league here, finance-wise. 

Current stats:

* Age: 30
* Assumptions: will (still) be single and counting 100% on my retirement savings to carry me through, retiring at 65 with no social security to depend on and no inheritances. 
* Traditional 401(k) balance: $51,000 (100% vested)
* Roth IRA balance: $2,300
* Credit card: $6,000
* Student loans (2): $25,000 total (about even, outstanding loan amount-wise)

New income: $150,000

Current monthly freelance: $1,500


Monthly expenses: $2,800 (no, these aren't changing - I live in a high cost of living area and am not willing to move -- these are all bills except food and spending $)

Plan of attack:

* Max out traditional 401(k) at new job - match begins day 1
* Roll over current traditional 401(k) into new 401(k) OR traditional IRA (not sure what's allowed yet)
* Use freelance income to pay off credit card (est: 4 months). OR pump money I'm planning on putting into savings to pay off credit card - est: 2 months including savings $ and freelance income.
* Quit using that credit card and apply for one with better benefits, then when I use (ex: travel, reimbursable work-related expenses) pay off immediately instead of carrying a balance.
* Put $2,000 into savings every month starting day 1.
* Use rest of freelance income to fund vacations + immediately put into savings each month until I need to use it. Remainder remains in savings.
* End of 2015, pay off 1 student loan
* If I receive my full bonus in early 2016, pay off other student loan. Otherwise repeat savings plan and pay off other student loan at the end of 2016/ when I have the $, whichever is sooner.
* End of 2016 = student loans paid off and minimum $24,000 in emergency fund savings account in bank (6 months of bills + spending money)

That's where I get stuck... I live in a high cost of living area and housing is also equally expensive, and I'm looking at needing to save about $80,000 before putting a solid down payment on an apartment within my price range ($400-450,000, once all debt is paid off). I've literally never even dreamed of possibly buying due to the crazy prices, so I want to make sure I'm planning this correctly.

I should also mention that I've been interested in getting my private pilot's license at some point, and will likely save up the $ needed to fund that using one/a few bonuses over the next few years. Otherwise, my bonuses aren't accounted for in this plan beyond my 2015 (received at beginning of 2016) plan. 

The way I see my options/Q's I have:

* I'll likely have enough to fund the max traditional IRA (then backdoor ROTH) contribution each year and still hit the $'s above, since I'm being generous with my spending allowance and taking a minimalist view on what I'll be able to put into savings, starting with day 1.
* Am I over-investing for retirement at the expense of investing for things like an apartment in the shorter term? I'm in a lucky situation where my rent won't increase more than a few hundred $'s over the next 3-5 years, and it's economically beneficial for me to stay considering I'm paying below market rate -- there's not a huge pressure to move, but I would eventually like to pay myself every month instead of someone else.
* I could continue putting away the same $ into savings every month for an apartment down payment (est: additional 3-4 years), but am not sure if leaving it in a plain savings account is the best way to handle that $, since interest rates are so low.

personalfinance,Figured I would ask you lovely people before getting a financial adviser.,"22/M/30k a year job, no woman and no kids. Inherited 350k from my dad that passed away when I was 18. Currently being invested by a damn good investor in my area. Now since I don't make much money would it be smart for me to put 100k down on a 150-175k (3 bed 2 bath good area) house and keep investing the 250k for retirement. The way I see it is that with my 401k contribution and compounding interest ill have 2 mil (modest 5% compounding interest) to retire with and a paid off house. Now I know with interest rates so low its smart for most people to just put the 20% down and keep their money working. Since I don't make that much, I would be able to live a more comfortable life knowing I would have a large emergency fund, money for small vacations, a nicer vehicle and not having to worry about living paycheck to paycheck. Am I delusional, or does it make some sense? Now I am not counting on renting it out to friends but it could happen. Plus when I meet some nice lady and we decide to settle down she would be paying rent until we were married or whatever. I'm still a kid, give me a break.

politics,Lets talk about Socialism,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about what socialism really is. This is not just on /r/politics either, literally everywhere on reddit and in real life people who barely have a ""he said she said"" understanding of socialism try to debate its viability. It's honestly infuriating. 

I decided to do a FAQ on Socialism to help some people out. Hopefully this will be something that can be linked during a discussion to help facilitate reasonable conversation. 

As for qualifications, I am currently working on a major in History and a minor in Political Science; I am also a Libertarian-Socialist. If you are worried about bias, I will not be arguing the viability of these systems over capitalism, just providing info for those who wish to argue amongst themselves.


**1. What does the  word ""Socialism"" mean?** 
 
That's a tough question, at what point did ""literally"" cease to mean ""literally"" and start to mean ""figuratively""? 

While the Dictionary defines it as ""Literally"", there is a case to be made that it has, for a while now, meant ""figuratively"". This is the natural progression of language but it makes political discourse a nightmare. So lets define socialism in the context of (US) politics.

**socialism**

1. the heavy taxation of rich members of society with the intent of redistributing that money to the less fortunate.

2. whatever the hell the USSR did, also known as Communism 

But actually, these are both wrong.

From dictionary.com

**socialism**

 1. a theory or system of social organization that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole. 

 2. (in Marxist theory) the stage following capitalism in the transition of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles. 

To define some terms

* Means of Production - Any non-human input used in the creation of a good or service.

* Labour - Any human input into the creation of a good or service.

So what is socialism? 

To a non-Marxist, socialism is any system where the people providing labour control the means of production.

To a Marxist, socialism is a stepping stone from revolutionary chaos to a communist society.

**2. So what does Marx have to do with this?** 

That takes a bit of history. Before Marx, socialism was split mostly into utopian camps and anarchist groups(ill explain later). The people advocating were shocked by the incredible poverty that the industrial revolution created; some fought for social change, some sought to escape society all together and make socialist communities.

Marx saw these groups as hopelessly utopian and decided to create a scientific socialism, one which could be studied and improved as time went on. However, a majority of Marx's energy was focused on critiquing capitalism.

He developed a theory of historical analysis that focused on the conflict of class and used it to speculate about the future of capitalism.

A rough idea of how he thought things progressed. (This is off the top of my head so it may need to be corrected later)

 * Primitive Communism
 * Slave based economies with a strong ruling class
 * Feudal Economies
 * Transition from Feudal to Capitalist Economy
 * Proletariat (Worker) Consciousness develops
 * Revolution led by the Proletariat
 * Socialism
 * Slow dismantling of unnecessary state power
 * Communism

And it turns out, for most of the early stuff, he was kinda right. Historians accept that palaeolithic people lived in communal egalitarian societies. Things such as class hierarchies and patriarchy developed alongside the creation of surplus food created by the adoption of agriculture.

**3. Wait, did you say ""anarchists"" what do those nut jobs have to do with socialism?**

Well Anarchists aren’t just about pipe bombs and punk music, they are actually socialists themselves. They just have a specific idea of how government should be dealt with.

These ideas are:

 * Humans aspire to be free and unhindered 

 * The use of power limits freedom

 * Therefore power should not be used if its use cannot be justified morally

 * Any pre-existing systems of power that cannot be justified morally must be dismantled

For example 

*A government passes a law preventing you from killing others.*

Well, that law has limited the freedom of killers. But it is saving the lives of any possible victims making it a justified use of power.

While the role of the government is pretty uniform across anarchist groups, ideas about how to manage the economy have divided anarchists into a good number of groups:

**Individualist Anarchism**: More focused on the individual as an individual and smaller groupings.

* Individualist Mutualists: Everything or almost everything brought to the market. Without the state to proctect it, capitalism collapses creating small, worker owned business through market forces. Businesses are collectively owned, though, but tend to think that they would be small and promote a lot of self-employment.
* Insurrectionists/Illegalists/Egoists: Focused on small, tight nit groups of individuals which are fluid in structure and membership. Often about not delaying liberty until mass popular support. Illegalists especially break the law for their own benefit, often ignoring the distinction between legal and illegal altogether. Most are communists supporting the abolition of markets.

**Social Anarchism**: More focused on the individual as a social creature and larger groupings.

* Collectivist Anarchism: Communities issue money to worker coops. These coops sell in a communal market set up by the community. Support mass revolutions. Some saw themselves as the true heirs of mutualism.
* Anarcho-Syndicalism: Support mass unionism used to end capitalism and the state. Most support One Big Union and structured along the lines of industry. Seek to end capitalism and the state through a general strike in which every worker goes on strike forcing the capitalists and the state to deal with them on equal terms. After the end of capitalism and the state, society structured along the same lines as the union that ended capitalism. Most are communists.
* Platformism: Support one big, unified, and unitary anarchist organization that would create a mass, popular revolution against the state and capitalism. The promote unity in theory and praxis. Think that this unity of anarchist theory and praxis as the only way to end the state. Believe that this organization should foster anarchism among the people to promote the idea of anarchism. Most are communists.

**Somewhere in Between**

* Classical Mutualism: Focused on an ethic and norm of reciprocity. Think that this runs counter to both capitalism and the state. Seek to create great industrial and agricultural federation. Most support some sort of market of worker cooperatives which are independent and compete on the market, but also an agro-industrial federation which allows them to cooperate with each other. Tries to balance the individualistic and social natures of the individual.
* Synthesis Anarchism: Seeks to create a broad alliance between various anarchist groups with each being able to implement their own ideas among themselves. Doesn't see any sort of superiority of one sort of anarchism over the others. Creates a broad and large organization, but one supporting the diversity within the organization allowing for the individual's individuality to shine through.

However, despite these groupings, individualist anarchists recognize the social nature of the individual while the social anarchists seek to promote individual natures and liberty for the individual. The distinction is mostly one of focus, tactics, and organization.

**4. Wait, are there multiple forms of Socialism too?**

Of course!

State Socialism - A conservative form of Marxism that believes a large state is necessary in protecting the revolution and ensuring worker control of enterprises rather than moving on to a stateless society

Libertarian Socialism - Borrows heavily from Anarchism, believes that socialism is best for society only when the role of the state is minimized

Market Socialism - Socialism implementing markets as a way of allocating resources

These are the basics, there are tons more though.

**5. Is socialism compadable with democracy?**

Actually, socialism is democracy. The core tenant of socialism is a system where ""people providing labour control the means of production"". This means that workplaces and companies would be democratic, rather than totalitarian.

Not only is socialism a democratic economy, it helps insure the state's democracy as well. Under socialism, the possible wealth differences between any two people would be very small compared to today. This means that less money can be used corrupting the government.

**6. BUT, MUH PROPERTY!?!?**

Funny thing, most forms of socialism do call for the end of private property. **But they also make a distinction between personal and private property.** So no, no one will be able to take your shirt, car, land, money, ect off your back.

Land will be owned by the community but that is exactly how land works now. In America you never buy a plot of land, the only reason we say we own land is because it sound nice. Land is just rented from the state. If you don’t believe me, stop paying your property tax and see just how much you own that land.

**7. Why will people work? What will stop the lazy from just slacking off and expecting to be paid anyway?**

Well, look back in history. All of the palaeolithic and a good bit of the neolithic era communities are run off a system very similar to socialism. 

Why did people work? 

Well, what else would they do? Honestly, have you ever tried to do absolutely nothing for a long amount of time? Even in a capitalist society that encourages people to make the most money with the least amount of effort I find it really hard not to do something productive with my time. But that’s just it, humans are wired to do something. [We strive to solve problems and better ourselves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKKPQiRRag) Even without the incentive of higher pay, most doctors would still practice(maybe not at as hard of hours), architects would still make building, I would still study History.

The combination of a strive to create with the general mindset of helping the community that helps you, like a debt that is constantly being paid back to the society that keeps you alive, would insure productivity.

**8. Well yea, people want to be Doctors, Architects, Historians. Who will do the hard/nasty/boring jobs?**

Keep in mind that we are mechanizing the hard/nasty/boring jobs at such an alarming rate that its hurting our employment. But still some of those jobs will persist.

Possible solutions include:

* Those jobs would be available for those who wish to be compensated more

* They would be divided equally among community members like chores

* People who work those jobs would get more free time to follow passions that don’t benefit society enough to get paid for

* People working through education would do those jobs part time

* People who have performed small crimes would be given extra chores

**9. Is religion compadable with socialism?**

Socialists and Anarchists have been fighting against organized religion for a while now, but that doesn’t make them anti religious. The problem resides in organized religion’s orientation to systems of wealth and power. 

In history you see the Spanish Anarchists attacking the catholic church during the early 20th century and Marxist Russians attacking the Orthodox church of Russia.
The didn’t do that because of a hatred of religion; it was because those institutions use religion to justify their hold on political, social, and economic power.

**10. What about when Marx said, ""Religion is the opiate of the masses.""?**

Well it's important to put Marx's quote into historical context. At the time, an opiate was a pain reliever, not a recreational drug. So Marx is saying that religion acts as a pain reliever for the isolation and alienation that capitalist society creates.


**11. Is/Was/Are _____ Socialist?**

**Obama**: No

**Nordic Countries**: No

**China**: No

**North Korea**: No

**Lenin's Russia**: Maybe. 

Some say No, but he was planning on following the plan of a Marxist revolution. 

Some say he distorted socialism to create an autocratic state. 

Others say Yes, and call it State Socialism, Communism, or Marxism–Leninism.

**Stalin's Russia**: Maybe. 

Most people say no, including many of the few who support Lenin.

**ObamaCare**: No

**Liberals**: No

**Welfare**: No

**The Nazi Party**: No.

Hitler used the word ""Socialist"" to appeal to the lower class

**12. This is all fine and good, but has socialism every actually worked?**

Sure. 

Check out the ""Free Territory"" in Ukraine, it lasted for about 3 years until it was crushed by the USSR.

Also, the Anarchists of Catalonia lasted about 3 years until it was destroyed by the Nationalists and the USSR 

Orwell's ""Homage to Catalonia"" talks about it. Great read BTW.

Many would argue Cuba, while I'm not a fan of single party systems, they are doing pretty damn well for how much shit we put them though economically.

Yugoslavia also passed reforms during the 50's that decentralized the government and introduced self management making it arguably more socialist than the USSR.

personalfinance,"Question on how to handle my significant others heavy debt, worst case.","Hello personal finance,


My significant other has a graduate degree from a top school in their field (law) and as such, has a significant amount of debt from this (~$200,000).  They are hoping that current federal loan forgiveness programs stay in place so that, 5 or so years from now, their debt will be forgiven assuming 1) steady payments are made and 2) they stay employed at a non-profit.  


The debt is currently accruing interest even with the steady monthly payments.  (I've only recently found out that 1) the debt was as large as it is and 2) payments do not cover interest.)  I consider myself very money/debt conscious, so the fact that these payments are not even covering the basic interest rate blows my mind.  As marriage is likely in our future together, how can I best prepare for handling this debt come ""worst case"" (we end up needing to pay it back ourselves)?


My debt is minimal and will likely be paid off come years end - I am also putting about 20% of my paycheck away in my 401k.  My significant others debt is moderate, outside of this loan, and will probably be paid off in about 18 months.  Our combined income would be about $110,000.",finance,1411915190

personalfinance,Advice for a long term financial plan for a 20yo,"Hello,

Well, I finally did it. After 3+ years of lurking around on Reddit, I've made an account. This is my first post, and I have been reading r/personalfinance for a few months now. I figured it was finally time to make an account as in terms of finances, I really don't know the direction I'm headed in, and I'd like some opinions on what I should do moving forward. I'm looking for advice on how I should save money long term, as well as just get things together better. I'm definitely not living paycheck to paycheck, but I really don't have that much savings.

Here's the deal: 

Income:
I'm 20, I am employed full time in local government (IT) and also attend college (this is now my 3rd year, I take around 2 classes a semester,  have 3-4 semesters left.) 
My  gross take home hovers right under $2000 for a two week period, I make the maximum contribution to my 401a, and usually end up with about 1450 for the two week period.
I do odd jobs for my homeowner's association as well as repair computers for friends. This probably adds in another 250 ish for the time period.
I have about 4,500 in savings.

Expenses:
Alright, here's where I know I'm probably going to get some flack: Two years ago, my younger brother got his driver's license. My parents could not afford to buy him a vehicle (they helped me with about 1,800 for my first car) so instead of letting him get a super inexpensive beater, I gave my parents my old car that was in great shape and paid off, and bought a new Focus ST since I figured I could afford it, and I wanted to build my credit. I kind of regret this, I think I could have done worse. The MSRP was just over 32k, but I bought it from a friend's dad who was the sales manager at a Ford dealer for 26.5k including 100k mile warranty from Ford. I put 5,500 down, financed 21,000, and here we are. The car has 20k miles, is still worth 23k according to Kelly Blue Book, I'm 4 months ahead on the loan and owe a little under 14k still the last time I checked. The monthly payment is $382, I have been paying $482, I think I have 3 years and three months left. My interest rate is 2.8%.

Car insurance for said car is 1,160 for 6 months. (no tickets, no accidents)

My discover card is paid off, they just increased my limit to $2250 and on my last bill my FICO was 791. I've had it since I was 16, the most I've ever had on it was $800, and I've never made the minimum payment.

I had student loans from last year in college, I applied for every scholarship I could, freshman year was nearly a free ride. I can wait to pay them off but I don't want to. I originally had a 3k loan, I have been paying octuple and currently owe $900. I'm thinking of just making two $450 payments and just getting rid of it.

In terms of housing, I live in a house with a roommate who's parents own it. I basically take care of the house, do the cleaning, and generally take care of all the day to day maintenance and repairs. They asked me for $70 a month in rent, I feel bad about it and usually give $120 and pay for house related things like new flowers for the front planter, the $30 Comcast bill, etc. I've been here for two years and will probably have another two at least. I usually buy all the groceries and do the cooking too, the problem is I love whole foods and between there, costco, and trader joes, I spend probably $175 a week. I also eat out at work 3-4 times a week.

I don't have a phone bill, my employer pays my bill, I am only allowed free phones and don't get to run out and get the newest phone every time it comes out.
I also go to the gym daily but work pays for that too. Health insurance, dental and eyesight are also covered through work, usually co pay is about $20. 

I'm worried about being able to buy a house when I lose my housing situation, and I have also debating being really frugal, saving up as much as possible, buying a house, then renting it out while I still live here, but I don't know if it will work. My point is, I'm really unsure of what I should be doing with my money, and I'd really like to get together a long term plan to keep myself on track.

I'm hoping with the input and suggestions of reddit I can put together a pretty solid plan for my priorities and get my personal finances in better shape.

personalfinance,I applied for Unemployment Insurance in NY about a month ago and I am not sure what this means.,"I quit my job back in 2/8/2014 and have not worked since. But I am attending school full time this fall. I thought I was not eligible for UI since I voluntarily quit my job to attend school. But school financial office had me apply anyway to have my income adjusted for federal aids since I did not qualify for it as I made over the limit for federal aids requirement.  
  
When I did apply and had a phone interview, they told me that I was eligible and that I can earn $350 per week before tax. They said it should take 3 weeks to start receiving my first deposit but it has been a month and I got a letter saying the following:  
  
  
Notice of Determination  
No unemployment insurance benefits will be paid to you for the period beginning 02/08/2014 until you have subsequently worked for an employer and earned at least 10 times your weekly benefit rate. Employment and earnings from non covered, excluded or self-employment will not count. Your weekly benefit rate is $350.  
  
Determination  
You quit your job without good cause.  

Reason  
You voluntarily left your employment to attend school to go to a different job field. According to unemployment insurance law, leaving employment in order to attend school or otherwise further one's education is a quit without good cause.  
  
  
I am having a hard time understanding this statement. It sounds like I am eligible but needs to earn $3500 to be eligible?

personalfinance,Help me not feel guilty about living at home,"Hello there lovely people, 

I'm 22 years old and recently moved back home after graduating college to save money. I started work in August and make $53,000/year gross.

I do have 19K in student loans, however, repayment doesn't start until December. 


$7,000 at 6.8% unsubsidized (I know this is accumulating interest)  
$900 at 5% subsidized  
$11,000 at 3.4% subsidized  


My plan was to pay off my loans as soon as possible, and save the rest (company has 401K matching) but my dad's jewelry business of 20 years recently tanked and he had to close his store. Because of this he refinanced the house (400K) to reduce the monthly payment to $1800/month. And because of the drop in income, my parents now have about $6000 in credit card debt combined. Also, I'm an authorized user on my dad's credit card because he thought it'd help me build credit but honestly I never use it and I think it's hurting more than it's helping because of his outstanding balance. I was also recently issued a corporate AMEX card so I went from zero to two credit cards really fast (no personal credit card debt though).

personalfinance,Is consolidating my 2 private student loans worth it for me?,"Hello everyone,

I have 3 student loans...1 federal and 2 private. Both of my private loans are variable rates (5.75% and 8%). The 8% loan is the biggest (12,500k and 30k).

Bitcoin,7 Ways Bitcoin Could Explode without Being a Currency,"Most average consumers will likely NOT have a need for Bitcoin directly as a CURRENCY.

1. International trade happening on the Blockchain (example: Alibaba exporters accepting Bitcoin).
2. Western Union or other remittance services switching back-end operations to transfer on the Bitcoin blockchain.
3. SMS money transfers denominated in local currency, run across the Bitcoin blockchain.
4. Ad networks running off Bitcoin exclusively as the payment and withdrawal service, with daily or instant payouts to website owners.
5. Companies offering all outsourced contractors to have their wages entirely in Bitcoin, with payouts available by the hour or day (imagine instant conversions to fiat also available).
6. Bitcoin-backed prepaid gift cards or traveller's cheques that can be used online or anywhere in the world within the existing network that Visa / Mastercard / Amex / traveller's cheques are accepted.  Bitcoin could be used directly if it's accepted in tourism areas.

personalfinance,21 yr old - Retirement/savings? Buy a house? Weird circumstances,"Hey /r/personalfinance, after lurking here for a year or so, and getting my finances a bit more organized thanks to your advice, I have some extra cash and am interested in opinions of a couple of my options regarding future investments and retirement options. A bit of a background on me - I'm 21, single, living in Southern California, going to school at a community college part time (about 4 years left for degree in engineering - yeah I suck at this school thing), run a small business without an easily predictable income.


*Savings overview:
I save a considerable percentage of my income (well, maybe not compared to the guys in this sub).


~$25k in the bank

~$10k in a couple peer to peer lending sites (i.e. prosper)

$18k in a TD account (self-directed investments. mostly tech)

$12k 2010 shitty Toyota that will live forever, paid off

No dedicated retirement savings

Owed 100k via personal loan (to be paid back this month)


* Income:
Currently attending a community college (dirt cheap), and do property rental management, web and app development, and run a small business (sales/call center). Basically just hustling trying to make that paper however possible.


Prior to 2012, didn't make any considerable amount of money

2012: I made about $70k

2013: I made about $42k

2014: about 75k so far

The important take-away is that I wouldn't consider any of my income ""stable"". I make about 10k a year in income that I would say I can rely on, so it's basically impossible to predict what 2015, etc. will look like for me.


* Expenses:
I live with my parents for free, so my expenses are fairly low, though I do have some expenses:

Auto is one of my biggest expenses. I drive over 30k miles a year, but I drive a shitty car.

Averaging 2.5k a month in overall expenses. (i.e. tech, clothes, food, alcohol, etc. i travel inexpensively for fun, but often enough that it adds up.)


The predicament:
I have lended an interest-only personal loan in the amount of $100k that will be paid back in full to me at the end of this month. (i.e. I have been collecting interest on it over the last year at 4%, and it will now be paid back. Unfortunately this means I will lose that sweet sweet monthly interest check.


**Here's my question:**

What should I do with this 100k? My parents are pushing me to throw it on a down payment on a house inland from where I live for $875k. I found one that I like, and can secure a 20-year loan from my parents at only 2.5% interest. I am not too keen on it because:

* I don't like living here in CA, and until now planned on moving to WA within a few years

* Still in a nice, new area, but much farther from the beach where I live now

* Not down for that yearly property tax

* I would rather take advantage of WA's no state income tax and move there, but won't do this for two years and this ties me down

* I don't feel like I have the income stability to pay this much for a house


With that said, I would plan on renting out rooms (income 2600 a month on a $4kish payment) to cover the bulk of the mortgage, and that interest rate is great since my parents would rather I stay near them. In addition, if I don't buy a place, renting in the area I *would like* to live is $3000 for a 1000 sq ft condo, less space than I have at my parents' now for free.


...or I could just throw it into vanguard, or start saving for retirement, which I really haven't researched, continue living with my parents for a couple years until they inevitably retire/move and deal with housing then.


Anyway, I really appreciate any advice. Right now, I'm leaning toward just buying the place and tripping balls to make those payments and taxes.",finance,1411941287

personalfinance,Personal Finance hell but looking better! Help with the near future budgeting. (long),"Ok here is my situation. I'm single 40 y.o male that has had a run of ups and down financially but soon things will look better.

I have always been very careful with my money but I need some general guidance to get me on the right path. 

When I got out of college (96) I got a good job, traveled the world on the company's dime and saved every penny I had to pay off my student loans. Double and triple payments when I could. I finally got them paid off completely in 2001. So I was told I should buy a house since interest rates were low and lots of houses available. I save for several years since I was use to not having that money and I bought my house for 189k in 2004 with 8.6% down. Now it's worth about 205k but I've done nothing to it in 10 years. Not a drop of paint or anything. I had to get PMI but I got an FHA. 

In 2007 I lost my job due to the economic downturn, I took alot of low paying jobs to pay the mortgage but it wasn't enough. In order to save the house from foreclosure sale in 2010 I had to file bankruptcy. I had 4 months of back mortgage payments (1600 x 4 + fees =$7500) and about $3500 in other debt.  I got a loan ($5k) from my mom to save the house. Since 2008 I've been making $20/hr do IT work of and on and traveling to some of the worse places in America. I haven't made over 25k in the last 4 years. I've paid down some of the 'other bankruptcy debt' to about $2500 and i'm only a month behind on the mortgage (i'll be caught up on 10/10). But the house has to have it's Eves enclosed and I'm getting fined $XYZ by the HOA to get it fixed (not brave enough to open the judgement letter to find out how much I owe) and my furnace needs a $500 board (a bandaid) for heat. I didn't worry about the furnace because work would have me away from home so I didn't need it, now I will.

I got a offer last week for a new IT Management contract job at one of the best companies to work for in my area. I start next Monday. I'm going from $20/hr to $65/hr. Woohoo! My commute will be 30 mins against traffic but my (paid off) truck is in poor condition as it's been sitting in airport parking lots for the majority of the last 6 years. Trade in value maybe 3k. I haven't run a credit report because it's just going to be depressing after a bankruptcy, late mortgage payments, no credit cards, etc. 

So my questions are.

Should I wait to pull my credit / FICO scores once I start getting some bills out of the way or do it now? Why either way?

I prefer to pay cash for as much as I can but the Roofing / Eves stuff is going to be about $3K should I finance? With my bad credit should I just save up pay cash or try to finance at a higher interest rate to help build my credit back up? Plus I have to deal with the fines. 

I need a reliable vehicle as this winter around here may be brutal. I doubt I have the credit to get a car so.... options? I'm going to put a little money in the truck in the hopes it gets me through the winter but I don't know if it will be enough. 

I'm going to cash out the furnace repair since I'm going to be home this whole winter (first time in 5 years). Or should I save a couple of checks, suffer with a couple of space heaters and get a new furnace? Finance? 

What should I pay first? Get the bankruptcy fully paid off (2.5k ish + Mom), or take care of the house (cheap reliable winter car, roof and furnace) or suffer and save, save, save to get the bank account up. Then take care of everything at once and have a nice hit on the ol credit score. 

How can I get rid of my PMI and get a lower mortgage rate (currently 5.20%). I take it I'd have to refi, and with bad credit I think I'm sunk. I'm with the worse mortgage servicer in the industry (Greentree) and I want to get away from them as soon as possible. 

Should I do as much as I can to get the credit scores up or do as much as I can to get to get money into savings so I can have the money to buy the things I need with cash and work on the credit later? 

Thank you for your time.",finance,1411946746
personalfinance,Best way to maximize paying off my $10K+ student loans,"I am 18 and did one semester at a University racking up;

* Salie Mae Loan: 
* Total: $7,793.91 
* Interest Rate: 9.12% 
* Nelnet Student Loans: 
* Direct Subsidized: $1,795.91 
* Interest Rate: 3.860% 
* Direct UnSubsidized: $1,041.23 
* Interest Rate: 3.860%

**Total: $10,631.05**

All the loans are differed but because my current community college I am going to didn't publish that I was enrolled before the Nelnet loans required me to pay I racked up some debt. I have a few questions about what I should do. I currently make about $300 a week working anywhere from 28 to 32 hours a week. I would like to try and get these loans paid off quickly, but efficiently. My only expenses currently are $50 a week in gas. It doesn't usually cost that much, more like $45 to $47 but I put $50 away so that way I can make sure I have enough. I also have savings goals in my YNAB for saving for next semester of school (Spring 2015 and Fall 2015) while also saving for other things such as Christmas presents and spending money. (I can provide a screenshot of my YNAB budget categories if it helps answers my questions)

My questions are as follows:

1) Should I be asking salie mae for a lower interest rate? 9.12% Seems kind of high to me. (I had a consignee, my mom.)

2) I am currently putting away $100 a week out of my paycheck and when I get $300 I send it in to reduce the principal. Would it be better to keep doing this or should I send $100 a week to reduce the principal before they apply the interest? would that even help?

3) I am thinking about getting a credit card to put my daily expenses on such as gas, spotify bill, and other purchases. Which one would be good for someone in my situation? Also should I be requesting my credit report (using the free once a year option) before I apply for a credit card?

4) I am still somewhat confused on which of my Nelnet loans gain interest and which don't while in deferment. Which of the two Nelnet loans should I be paying off first?

Any help would be appreciated, thank you!",finance,1411947431
personalfinance,I screwed up and this is what I'm doing about it.,"I'm a financial disaster.  I never really cared until recently. I just accepted that I would always be in debt. But lately I've become obsessed with paying this off fast and living debt free. A lot of it comes from lurking on these boards and reading about other people's success. Here's the ugly truth...

Liabilities:
*Federal Student Loans: $133,753 @5.25% (undergrad + b-school)
*Private Student Loans: $67,297 @5.75% (undergrad)
*CC1: $10,549 @ 0% until July 2015
*CC2: $7,337 @ 13.99%
*CC3: $5,115 @ 15.24%
*Taxes due: $10,000 (est) - I pay $250 per month on this.
**Grand Total: $234,051 (AAAAAAAAAGGGGHGHHHHH!!!!). 
This is a pants shitting number. But it's not all gloom and doom.

Assets:
*Savings Acct 1: $12,000 (appx) - can't access this for the time being.
*Saving Acct 2: $1,412
*401k: $4,600 (company match coming at yearend, I think it will be about $1500).
*401k (partner): about $6000

**Total Financial Assets: appx $24,000**

***NET WORTH: -210,051***

Here's what I have going for me:
*I make a decent living and I have worked really hard to put myself in a position for good career prospects. Gross income this year is $108K + $30 - 40K annual bonus. I will probably look for a new job after the annual bonus comes in. I expect a bump to about $175K gross. That sounds like a lot but I live in the country's most expensive city, so its like earning $95K in Indianapolis.
*Partner makes about $60K. Has no debts.

Near-term goals...
Since I can't access savings acct 1 for a while, my top near term goal is to get savings acct 2 up to an equivalent of 1 month of my after tax income (about $5,450). We're about $4000 short but I think we can knock that out in a month. I have a fancy road bike I'm going to sell (will get around $1500), and a PS4 I don't really need because I'm a grown ass man ($350). I have a scheduled $600 deposit for 10/1, as does my partner. After we he that $5,450 number, then I am going to go absolutely agro on paying down the CC debt. 

CC debt:
CC1 monthly payment is about $216. Since this is no interest I will pay the minimum and focus on the others.
In addition to monthly payments I think I can pay down $800 a month. I'll focus on CC3 first.
In January I will get my bonus for 2014. no way to tell how much it will be, but I think we've done better than expected this year so I'm going to ball park the after tax at about $14,000. I'll use that to pay off the zero balance CC and some of CC3.  After I pay off CC1 I will transfer the balance from CC2 to CC1 for another year of zero interest. The good news is that CC2 also has balance transfer offers at zero percent. Anything left on CC3 will get transferred. This will keep my minimum payments low while I pound down the principal.  I think I can knock out the balance by the end of 2015, which would just leave the taxes and student loans.

Long term goals...
Once the revolving debt and taxes are paid off I will start investing in my retirement account again - I'm way too underfunded for my age (34). The interest on my student loans is not that bad so I feel fine starting the 401k again. I'll focus on the private loans first since the Federal loans are more flexible if you have unexpected financial trouble. There are 11 different loans - I will snowball these bitches. I think at the end of 2015 I will be making enough to support both my partner and I (and a kid???). I'll ask that she keep working and we'll devote her entire pay to eliminating those loans. I think we can do this in 5 years.

Interest is the enemy, people. Hate your enemy. Kill your enemy. I'm going to punch this debt in the dick.

Regarding my student loans: I know people get all up in arms about this. It happened. It sucks. I'm not really here to debate the poor judgement or the politics of student loan debt. Doesn't matter because I'm only looking forward. So if you're going to chime in and render judgement or talk about that dynamic, just save it, you're not saying anything new or that I haven't heard before.",finance,1411954743

personalfinance,Question about deducting moving expenses from income taxes.,"This is my first post in this sub Reddit, so forgive me if this is not the correct place to ask this question. 

My girlfriend recently accepted a job in another state, located clear on the opposite side of the country. We are in the process of moving and have a question about what moving expenses she can deduct from her income taxes. 

From what we can tell, she can deduct the cost of the moving truck, gas, and hotels while we are on the road. The question is, can she deduct the cost of a hotel while we look for a permanent place to live in the new city? or possibly the difference between the cost of a house and the cost of a hotel room? 

She works for the federal government, and because of how they operate we had to move across country on less then a week notice, so we don't have a new house lined up yet and are figuring this out as we go. Any responses would be appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1411956606

financialindependence,"I don't want ER, but mental illness may force me into it. My income is high, how can I avoid high taxes while I prepare for FI?","Hello everyone.

I'm currently 26 and I'd like to keep working for quite a long time. However, I also have pretty severe mental illness. It's well managed by medication right now, but the drugs that I take haven't been around for all of that long, and no one really knows what the long term effects are. If I stop taking the drugs, I stop being able to work productively. The net effect is that I feel like my ability to work is a ticking time bomb and I don't know when it will go off (and it may never go off), but I want to be prepared when this happens. I think it's reasonable to expect that I'll be able to keep working for at least another decade.

My income is quite high, I expect to have ~200k of income this year. However, I'm unmarried, don't own property, or have kids, which means that my taxes are *incredibly high.* I expect that all told, I'll probably end up paying 55-60k in taxes this year. For reference, last year (2013) I made 151k AGI (so this was after 17.5k into my traditional 401k), 141k of which was taxable, and I paid 32k in federal tax, 6.5k in state tax for a total of 38.5k in taxes. The only things I could deduct were 17.5k into the traditional 401k, a few hundred dollars of charitable contributions, and ~3.2k into an HSA.

My tax expenditures significantly exceed the other things I spend money on; I haven't done any exact accounting of my expenses, but they were less than 30k last year. The upshot of all of this is that I feel like I am already playing good finance offense (I make a lot of money), and good finance defense (my spending is small relative to my income) and the next place that I can get big wins is finding ways to avoid all of this tax burden. I could probably find ways to squeeze my spending to get it down to 20k or less, but I don't feel that this is worth the extra 10k/yr that'd go into my investment accounts; I feel that if I put that effort towards work instead, it'll pay off bigger in the end (and I'll be happier.)

The interesting wrinkle in this is that a lot of FI advice suggests things like putting money into a traditional retirement account and rolling it over into a roth account after early retirement when your income is lower. However, rolling that over doesn't actually work if you are still working and having a high income (and I hope to work at least until I'm 50, but want to be prepared to stop working by 35.) I'm also already maxing out my traditional 401k (well, this year I made the mistake of putting it into a roth account instead, but I won't be making that error in the future.) What more can I do? I feel like there must be some way to avoid paying so much in taxes (my tax expenditures will be nearly twice my other expenditures for christ sake!), but I haven't figured it out yet.",finance,1411963776
Bitcoin,Proposal: Open source app that anyone can buy for $10 and have BTC,"So it's obvious that people are fed up with the banking sector.  It's obvious that people, have some form of  interest in Bitcoin - why else would it be so polarizing?  Why not make an open source app that allows a user to buy ($10 - {app store-fees}) worth of btc?  I bet that if it was that easy for the masses to take a ""gamble"" on this 'future money' then a huge swath of people would buy in.  

The marketing as an open source app is key. It showcases two fundamental aspects of bitcoin; transparency and equality.

Basic specs:

- Utmost security: It needs to prove to everyone that the ($10/{BTC/USD}) purchased is truly the user's and that that money can't be taken away by anyone.  This can only be done in an open source environment; just like Bitcoin's.  

- Ease of entry and use: In the best case scenario, the user should just be able to click ""buy"" in whatever app store and have the money in a functional yet easy to use BTC wallet. This needs to be across many different financial jurisdictions.  Challenging but critical, otherwise it'll risk not hitting critical mass.  Being a well publicized large open source project would add an element that might help overcome political challenges.

- Education: This app would act as a teaching portal about Bitcoin and good practices.  It'll share the collective  knowledge and ""wisdom"" about how to handle satoshi.  It probably should even contain a wiki.

Once made and released, marketing is super easy.  As relatively early adopters, we could all easily invest another $10 and highly rate the app (with integrity too since it'll honestly be a 5 star app).  It immediately becomes #1 on charts and gets worldwide recognition.  If done right, this will bump up the price a bit which will further encourage people to ""gamble"" on this investment for a measly $10.  If it grows enough and is introduced to the degree of whatsapp, we allow more than the current BTC market cap's worth of USD to be distributed as BTC into the hands of the masses. This could be a gateway to a powerful remittance system which alone will help further adoption.

personalfinance,26 years old and finally making good money - how to set myself up for financial success?,"A quick bit about me.  I am 26(M) and have been married to my wife (26F) for 2 years now.  We have both been working part-time, never had much of a savings, and spread ourselves out way too thin, barely scraping by, and juggling payments at times.  I will admit, we enjoy the finer things in life.. but our income was not enough to support our desired lifestyle.  We either had to cut back, or make more money.. so we did a little of both.  We cut back on cable/internet and went from paying $140 a month to $85 a month for Comcast.  We were being gouged by Verizon and finally had enough, and got out of that and into Republic Wireless, and are now paying $50 a month.  We also cut way back out eating out, and learned to manage our money better, and stopped paying bank overdraft and NSF fees.  By doing this, we have managed to pay off a few annoying cards/loans.

I now work full-time with a frac service company, and she is a police dispatcher.  My earning potential is between $90k-$140k a year depending on hours/per-diem.  I work 100+ hours a week, with days off here and there.  She earns around $18k a year, also depending on hours.  Neither of us anticipate a decrease in hours any time soon.  The only reason I am able to type this out now, is because I am on a paid standby, due to complications at the frac site (I have been wanting to do this for a few weeks now).  I want to take advantage of this opportunity, because I doubt that I will do this forever (we've talked about starting a family in a couple of years).  My goal is to put in the hours now, so that in the future, we can do what we enjoy, and not have to worry about debt.  I am seeking advice on the best way to repair our finances and to set ourselves up for a ""worry free"" life.  My 401k will not kick in until after 6 months, but I am going with 5%, and my company matches 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2.  We also want to work on an emergency fund ASAP.

We currently rent ($850, includes utilities), but she is pushing for home ownership.  I wanted to hold off, mainly because I wasn't sure where we were going to wind up.  We both love the home we are in, and I really wouldn't mind buying it some day.  I started this job in August, and get paid every week, while she gets paid every 2 weeks.  We decided to commit the rest of this year to paying off the majority of our debts.

My Score on credit karma is a 710. The only things that aren't perfect are number of hard inquiries (5. Last year I bought a car and rented a house so I have a couple hard pulls from those) and the length of time my accounts have been open. I got an F in this category because my credit card has only been open for 1 year 8 months. How long of an age do credit companies look for as an acceptable standard? I only have one credit card right now because my credit was so piss poor in the past that I could only get a secured card. 

On that note, I plan to trade in my current car and buy a newer one in less than a month. I will need to finance it as a joint loan since my husband is the breadwinner (and his credit is better and will get us better interest rates).

And forgive me being ignorant, but I'm a stay at home mom and this is the first time I haven't had a job since I was 14. Will I likely get declined since I technically have no income?

personalfinance,Personal loan for debt consolidation?,"Greetings personalfinance community!

I took a look at the FAQ and didn't see this question addressed, but if I overlooked something please let me know (as I'm sure you will).

I've some debt I would like to consolidate. I don't have any astronomical debts, but I'd like to consolidate things so I'm only paying one bill per month, and perhaps saving a little money in the long run.

My relatively short list is as follows.

Debt type // Balance // Interest Rate

Auto Loan // $8,332 // 6.94%

Home Depot CC // $1,204 // 26.99%

Lowes CC // $1,211 // 24.99%

Kohls CC // $515 // 21.9%

I did some quick looking around and it looks like the interest rate on personal loans is, at best (which I probably wouldn't get the best rate), at round 9-10%. So, it may not be in my interest to make my car payment part of the consolidation since that rate is probably lower than what I'd expect to get with a personal loan.

That being said - what's the best approach for consolidating the few credit cards that I have? I would intend to pay them off, and just stop using the accounts. Is a personal loan the way to go? If I were to go that route, would I just contact the bank I use for my current accounts, or should I look into joining a credit union?

Thanks a lot for your time folks! Please let me know if I've failed to include any information that prevents someone from providing an informed response.",finance,1412003253

personalfinance,Looking for student loan advice,"Hi everyone,

I've been a lurker in this subreddit, and I think it's amazing there are so many good people that offer their advice to complete strangers. I'm looking for some advice as well.

I am 27 years old, and I graduated from college in 2009. I am married, have one kid and another on the way. I live/work in PA as a project manager and currently only make 33k which is considered 'decent' in my area. I am paying about $500-600 a month in school loans (listed below). I don't have any other debts, and I just spend money on necessities like food, diapers, wipes, etc...

Here are my loans and what I still owe:  
*AES: $10,371.31 ($4,275.77 at 3.1% and $6,095.54 at 3.65%) - monthly payments are $28.63 and $41.93  
*Discover Private: $17,801.84 at 4.250% - monthly payments are $123.50  
*Chase Private: $22,776.36 ($19,541.79 at 7.25% and $3,234.57 at 9.75%) - monthly payments are around $202  
*FedLoan Gov't: $20,894.69 (Direct Subsidized Consolidated: $17,543.77 at 5.875% and Dir. Unsubsidized Consolidated: $3,396.38 at 5.875%) - monthly payment is around $117

My total as of today is $71,844.50.

I wasn't very good with accounting/math/finances in school, and I've never taken a class about handling finances (not an excuse, just fact).
I'm just looking for someone to give me a good direction to start moving in. I don't know anything about investing, and I don't know how to handle getting out of debt other than paying my monthly bills on time. I feel like I'm going to be paying these off the rest of my life, and my dream of owning a house and being able to afford things in life will be just that, a dream.

I'm just looking for good, sound financial advice. I am open to trying anything. If you have any questions for me, I'll be sure to reply.
I apologize in advance for any formatting issues.",finance,1412007789
finance,Ethanol Trading. Anyone involved or have more information on this?,"Right now a lot of my coursework in my International Food and Resource Economics degree is touching on market dynamics in Brazil with sugarcane production. I've done a little bit of research on the U.S/Brazil ethanol markets as well as how the EU views it in their future energy policy. It's very fascinating and I would love to have a career that requires analysis of multiple commodities (corn, sugar, interest rates, exchange rates, etc) on a global scale. 

From what I've seen from a few quick searches is that it is an extremely niche industry with a decent amount of jobs available in Houston with the major oil players. I also found a few companies on the West coast with biorefineries who need in-house analysts to develop models and monitor the markets. The pay is very good and it certainly seems to be a growing industry in the next decade according to current growth projections.

I recently changed my major from Economics to a more specialized Resource Economics degree and I am excited at the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge instead of simply learning general theory as was the case previously. If you have any information or first hand experience with this matter it would be a great help in my research into this growing field.",finance,1412008618
personalfinance,"I have perfect credit, so why is the lowest interest rate offered when I refinance 4.41% for my auto loan?","Current interest rate is 7.73% on a five year loan that I owe $12,500. I'm looking to refinance and so far the best I've been offered is 4.41%. In fact, many places have turned me down. I don't understand why I am a risk for these banks... I have a credit score of 784 (never missed a payment on anything ever) and a well paying job.

personalfinance,Best way to deal with two loans not in my name?,"I've got two student loans on my list that are bugging me a bit. 

* $6,500 @ 7.90% - Parent PLUS loan (mother)
* $15,800 @ 8.890% - 'Private' loan serviced by ACS (when I got this loan years ago I thought it was 'govt' in that it was sponsored by my state..

Now, as you can imagine, those interest rates are rather unfortunate as far as student loans are concerned. 

I've just refinanced all of my other (government/in my name) loans with SoFi to a lower rate, so that's great... except for that fact that these two loans (**not in my name**) could not be refinanced. 

Does anyone know of a good way to refinance these loans? I am fully capable of making complete payments on all of the loans, but I want the interest rates lower -- and I'd like to get the loans off my mother's back in entirety. Granted making payments is doing that, but I'd like to do it in advance for her. 

One note.. the larger balance loan shows up on my credit report as I was the cosigner. The PLUS loan does not, it was her loan alone. 

My credit union offers private loans up to about $15k (so not quite enough) but the rate is about 8.7%, so what's the point? I managed to secure a ~4% rate on my other loans through SoFi, so I am looking for a company that will give me a personal loan (**not tied to these two student loans in my mothers' name?**) that will offer me a decent rate. 

(Rant mode) 
Dang it, I'm young and have lots of working years in front of me, and want to pay these bills, not run from them! Reward me with a reasonable rate and you'll get your profits @ 4%! Argh.

A comment made in the above link states the following

&gt; But since no central authority controls it, it cannot be politically messed with, inflated, confiscated remotely, etc.


The only legit part about that is it cannot be confiscated remotely (Well... Unless someone steals it...)

Inflation/Deflation - One group buys up 20% of coin, holds it as long as they want. This removes coins from the market and causes deflation. This group months later then sells all the coins they bought up. This causes inflation. This can be done by a single entity that has enough funding to do so (Example: Any government or company that makes billions).


Politically messed with: See above. The FED could buy any amount they want and be able to control it as they see fit.

Bitcoin DOES NOT require banks or governments for these things to happen. Any altcoin is perfect evidence of these things.

Bitcoin IS more resistant to these things in some aspects. That is true.

personalfinance,"School refunded me the money that I put in for tuition ($1200), what's the best interest rate I can find to offset the accruing interest on my stafford?","I have a $5500 unsubsidized stafford loan with a 4.66% interest rate and a 1.072% loan fee.

personalfinance,Looking to switch banks and would like to know everyone's opinion on who to switch to.,"I am currently banking with Bank of America and I am fed up with them. The only reason I chose them was because they were the ATM on my college campus. After 6 years with them I am still treated like trash. 

I have a very large list of problems with them, but the most recent issues have been fraudulent charges. I have been issued a new credit and/or debit card four times over the past month. The latest time, last week, was because I purchased the Sims 3 for myself and my fiance to play. After telling me they needed to issue me a new card, they then told me I needed to pay $25 to send the card. Done.

So I wanted to come here and ask all of you to help me out and choose a new bank. I am looking for everyone's opinion on their own and bank and to also let me know which bank would offer the best package for me.

I currently have one checking account and one credit card with BOA. I have a normal checking that I do not need to pay any annual/monthly fees on. There is also no fee attached to my checking account if I go below a certain amount of money. 

As for my credit card, I have the BankAmericard with travel reward points. I earn 1.5 points for every $1 spent. No annual fee. I can redeem my points for flights, hotels, vacation packages, cruises, baggage fees, and car rentals. No limit to amount of points I earn and they do not expire. The APR varies between 14.99-22.99%.

The most important thing to me is the credit card. I would like to transfer my entire balance to the new bank with no balance transfer fee. I would like to continue to earn points towards travel. I use my credit card for work purposes and get refunded for everything I spend. Hence the travel points. 

I have looked into Chase and TD Bank as they are larger and popular banks. I have no knowledge about other banks and I am interested to hear what you all have to say. I am happy to add any info that is needed.",finance,1412022369

personalfinance,Budget Advice,"Hello,

First I just want to say that I searched the FAQ and Rules posts and I couldn't find anything against this type of post. Essentially I am asking for some advise on my budget. This is what I am working with.


I currently work two jobs.

Main Job $24,000 per year (around this) which comes to around $630 per paycheck after taxes and my employer takes out health insurance costs, retirement, and money that goes towards stock (IRA perhaps? sorry I am not entirely sure, but I take out $15 per paycheck that gets invested for me) and $55 per paycheck that goes to a car payment. I get paid the 15th and 30th of every month.

Second job is a freelancing photography gig for a local production studio where pay varies greatly. I make $25 per hour, and get paid every two weeks. Some of my recent checks have been for $137.90, $210.80, $62.15....you can see that this varies greatly depending on when they need me to work. But, I started the job in February and have currently earned right at $2,000 net pay on the year. 

**After adding this average to my main income, I estimate that I make around $1,500 per month after taxes.
**

Now for my expenses:

Rent: $430 per month

Cell Phone: $80 per month ($20 of this goes towards the phone which I could pay off for $250 and reduce this bill to $60 per month)

Car Insurance: $45 per month (of course you can pay this six months at a time for a reduced price)

Utilities (including Internet): Average around $170 per month

Main School Loans: $280 per month (This is an Income Contingent plan that changes every year) with around $65,000 balance remaining. (I am on the forgiveness plan that will erase this debt in 10 years so long as I keep working in the public sector)

Perkins Loan: $40 per month with $816 balance remaining

Private Student Loan: $130 per month (this is fixed and will not change) with around $16,000 balance remaining

Credit Card: (varies) 16.99 % interest rate with a current balance of $3,420

Food, gas, etc. 

It's obvious from my credit card and student loan debt that I made some poor decisions at a young age. But that being said, I have never missed a payment on anything and my credit is in fine shape. I currently have most of my bills set up to come out of my bank account automatically which reduces rates slightly and I have them staggered to where I am paying roughly the same amount on the 15th and 30th of each month.

My question for you is, how should I start to chop into my debts? It seems to me that the credit card is the first thing that I should take care of, but the problem is that I usually don't have much left at the end of the month to throw much more than the minimum payment towards it. 

I feel like the credit card, $816 perkins loan, and the $4,000 car loan are the things that I could get taken care of the quickest to have extra cash flow, but it just never feels like I am making a dent in anything.

Thanks for reading, and again, I apologize if this type of post is not acceptable.

My grandmother recently passed and I had to take on the funeral costs, I had nothing so I had to drop out of University get a full-time job, and put all of the costs on my line of credit and credit card.  There is no one in my family that could have taken this responsibility, and my mother thinks I've been okay with it and still afloat.  She doesn't have much time here either and I don't want her to spend her last bit stressing herself out and thinking I won't be okay when she's gone, no one needs that stress when they're ill.  She cannot work, has nothing saved so I have been taking on all of our bills for roughly a year.  She also does not have life insurance and soon enough I will have more funeral costs.  I feel rather overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.

I was fortunate enough to get a contract position that ends in April 2015, I will have made $13,000 (after deductions) from this Friday until the contract ends. which is not much.

My current debt situation is:

$3,000.00  OSAP 5.50% interest rate

$2,000.00 University

$4,000.00 Credit Card 19.99% interest rate 

$5,000.00 Student Line of Credit 4.50% interest rate

I do not have an emergency fund, and $600 to my name right now.  I am terribly worried on ever being capable of getting a better job once my contract ends, or even starting a career without being finished my degree.  Debt feels like a pit which you can easily drown in, I suppose and before things get worse I would love some opinions.

Currently my monthly bills are:

$800 rent

$60 cell

$300-400 groceries

the rest I've been putting roughly 100$ into each debt.

Which debt should I be paying off first?  Or should I be saving instead?  I'm honestly clueless on what is the best approach to handle all of this.

Bitcoin,The real reason behind the falling price of bitcoin,"Well, it's actually my speculation and reasoning, not necessarily the truth. There seems to be no one mentioning this.

I think the biggest missing part of bitcoin economy for now is the interest rate. The implication is quite huge. In forex market, interest rates(or the spreads) and their trends are the primary driving force of long-term price move. Recently most commodities are losing their value partially due to the expectation of the coming usd rate-raising cycle. The price pressure of btc/usd is going to remain as the interest-rate spread of the pair is expected to widen. 

Edit: I don't think the 'natural rate' of bitcoin is actually zero, but the missing of related infrastructures makes the nominal rates unable to be 'discovered' and the market extremely inefficient.",cryptocurrency,1412040297

personalfinance,Seeking advice for a student who has made some very poor financial decisions in her past.,"I graduate this upcoming Spring and I am trying to plan out the smartest way to handle the debt I have accrued throughout my time in college. I have financed college on my own for the most part with the exception of occasional help from my parents. Neither of my parents went to college and I am the first in my family to do so. I made a lot of *extremely* dumb financial decisions in my first couple years of college such as opening credit cards and getting more loans than I truly needed. Of course I had the intention of paying off the balance on these cards but unfortunately they didn't happen. Trust me when I say I have a lot of regrets about my financial decisions but a small part of me feels relieved that at 22 I have already learned my lesson about debt and how bad credit cards can be if you are not being smart about it. 


I haven't opened any new cards in a few years and I have only been taking out the loans that I need. On top of that I have been eligible for financial aid and subsidized loans for the past two years and that has helped lower my debt and my interest rates immensely. 


Some basic info about me before I list out my financial situation. I am currently 22 attending the University of Florida. Like I said, I'm graduating in spring and my major is Sociology with a minor in Mass Communications. I have plans on continuing my education in Grad School for Public Relations but I haven't made any commitments because the state of my finances is making me weary of getting additional debt from a masters program. I work part-time on top of being in school full time and make anywhere from $700 to $800 per month. If I do not go to grad school I do have the guaranteed option of being promoted in my current retail job which will earn me a potential salary of around $30k a year and at that point I would most likely save up to then further attend grad school in the future. My other option would obviously be to seek a job in my current field or like I said, look at my options for grad school. 

Also, I have a Transunion credit score of 623 and a FICO score of 612. &amp; My parents pay for my car payment and insurance and it should be paid off next year and if I were to sell it at that point it would be worth around $8000.

My balances are quite high coming off of the summer but fortunately I did just recently pay off the Kohls card.    

Here are some of the questions I have:

•	Being as this is spring will be my last semester of undergrad, is it smart to take out a subsidized loan of $1500 in order to pay off the Discover balance? This would have a considerably lower interest rate than the 24.9% I am currently paying. 

•	I am very seriously interested in visiting Europe for this first time next summer during the 6 month grace period of my loan repayment (if I don't attend grad school) is it extremely silly to take this trip? It will cost approximately $3000 and I will be paying for it by saving, tax returns and hopefully some help from parents. I'm also potentially considering looking into masters programs in Europe as they are considerably cheaper than in the US.
 
•	Which loan repayment plan do you recommend? I'm most interested in the Standard, Graduated and PAYE plans as those leave me with the smallest total amount paid over time.

the loan itself is through Honda and has an 18% interest rate. I plan on selling it once spring comes around so i would be taking off the $40 insurance this winter.

I have yet to ride it this entire year and now have a baby so i no longer have interest in owning a motorcycle. 

 I feel like this would be a great idea in two ways.

1. The payment seems to be broken down to ~$90 principal ~$40 interest. if i instead pay the same monthly balance to american express i would be putting the extra $40 straight to the payoff amount.

2. i would gain the benefits from my cards sign up bonus by spending the required amount within the time frame.

investing,Shorting REITs,"Hi guys,

So I was looking over real interest rate growth over the past 50 years and noticed that in the 2012 and 2013, real interest rate growth bounced back to roughly 15% and 13%, respectively.  2012 was the first year that posted positive real interest rate growth since the beginning of the great recession.

Now, anyone that knows anything about real estate knows that real estate it is a capital intensive industry and REITs use debt (leverage) to boost returns.   Increasing real interest growth makes owning real estate generally less profitable and lowers property prices as a result.

Obviously if the growth in the economy and rents exceeds the growth in the real interest rate there isn't a problem, but at some point I believe real interest rate growth will exceed rent growth and we will start seeing properties lose value and trade at higher cap rates.  The hard part is timing it.

I'd like to know your guys' thoughts?  Is there anything wrong with this basic analysis? What are some other metrics I should look at to time the next real estate down turn?

Up until late 2007/early to mid 2008 things were good. Money was plentiful, people were happy, stress for the majority of the populous was minimal. I had no particular interest in economics, politics, worldly events or much else apart from women, cars and partying. I did not really see the need to. It didn’t affect me and hence I never really thought about it. Why would I? I seemed to have everything I needed.

Very quickly, in fact so quickly it was if someone had just flipped a switch, I began to watch the demographics of my world change drastically. The majority of the population would have not seen it as I saw it. They were either working in call centres, offices, retail outlets, fast food outlets, rifle ranges or studying as students. Why have chosen those as my examples? Quite simply as this document has been written by me I have worked in and experienced all of them.

There were no Chinese whispers, orders from above, there were no company policies or statistics fed down through the company, there was no regular paycheques, there was no sick pay and there was most definitely no holiday pay. I was already committed to my chosen path. I had chosen to reject the other options and there was no turning back. It was just me on my own experiencing it for myself first hand directly and totally without any “slant”. If I could have waved my magic wand and changed things for the better, at the time, I probably would have. Looking back in retrospect I would have changed nothing. It was those tough times and absolute and total lack of protection or sanctuary that “manned me up”. I was 27 years old and it was, quite simply, do or die and there was no choice but to. I didn’t really fancy becoming one of the “27’s club” and there was nobody to turn to for help. I worked and worked hard. If I failed I was in big trouble.

&amp;nbsp;

Silver Certificate have an interesting history and give us a glimpse into the world that once was. You may come across a silver certificate dollar at some point in your travels, and if you do, it will be well worth it to snatch it up quick.

Silver certificates were first issued February 28, 1878 by the Department of the Treasury. Silver certificates could be exchanged for silver dollars. This continued up until March 25, 1964 when the Secretary of the Treasury stated that silver certificates would no longer be redeemable for silver dollars. Interestingly, even though silver certificates are no longer being printed, the certificates that still remain outstanding are considered legal tender and can be used just like any Federal Reserve note.

Why Were Silver Certificate Dollars Released?

They were produced due to the uproar by citizens who were enraged by the fourth coinage, which essentially put the United States on a gold standard. The certificates were redeemable for their face value of Silver dollar coins until 1964. However from June 24, 1967 until June 24, 1968, the silver certificates were redeemable in raw silver bullion.

The 1873 Coinage Act intentionally ended the coinage of silver dollars and ended the bimetallic standard that had been created earlier by Alexander Hamilton. Then in 1874, with the adoption of section 3568 of the revised statutes, Silver certificates were actually deleted from having legal tender status for debt payments exceeding five dollars. By 1875, many western banks and mining companies began to lobby to have the bimetallic standard restored.

The public's involvement grew due to the fear that there was not sufficient money in the community.

Interestingly, several members of Congress claimed that they did not know that the 1873 law would eventually lead to the demonetization of silver, even though they had three years to review this bill before putting it into action. Some would blame the passage of the act on various outside factors such as a conspiracy that would include foreign investors and even government conspirators.

On February 28, 1873, in response to all the uproar, the Bland-Allison Act as it would later become known, was put into effect when passed by Congress without the President's signature. This new act would not meet all of the demands of the western miners, but it didn't sure that the United States treasury would purchase between $2 million and $4 million of silver Bullion per month from these Western mining companies. The silver was to be minted into coins.

The 1878 silver certificates (the first silver certificate series) were issued in denominations of $10-$1000. Many financial institutions were cautious to except these new certificates. Although they were more convenient and smaller than dollar coins, the silver certificates were not accepted for all transactions. The Bland-Allison Act clearly stated that the silver certificates were receivable for customs, taxes, and public dues, as well as in bank reserves. However, they were not to be considered legal tender between individuals (private transactions).

Later, on July 12, 1882, Congress clarified the legal tender status of the silver certificates by authorizing them to be used in the reserves of national banks. In 1886, $1 dollar $2 dollar and $5 dollar silver certificates were authorized for print. This significantly increased circulation.

History was made in 1886. The only woman to ever have her portrait appear on the US currency note was Martha Washington. Her portrait appeared on the face of the one dollar silver certificate from 1886 until 1891. Her portrait also appeared on the back of the one dollar silver certificate of 1896.

The End of Silver Certificates

Further acts (1939 and 1946) would establish floor prices for silver ($0.71/ounce and $0.905/ounce respectively). In 1963, an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, authorized the issue of lower denomination notes allowing therefore, for the gradual retirement of the silver certificate dollar and at the same time releasing the silver bullion from the reserve. 1964, the secretary of treasury put in and to the redemption of silver certificates for coin silver dollars. Finally, redemption in silver was completely seized in June 1968.

Today, if you were to stumble across an old silver certificate dollar, chances are it would have more value as memorabilia than it would anything else. Some of the very early certificates will have a greater than face value but by and large, most of the certificates that still exist are worth little more than their face value. Still, the silver certificates dollar is highly sought after due to their interesting history as they have played a part in our great American history.

##The Basics

Congress ""makes laws that influence our daily lives. It holds hearings to inform the legislative process, conducts investigations to oversee the executive branch, and serves as the voice of the people and the states in the federal government."" 

Of the three branches of government, Congress is the only one elected directly by the people.

[Article I](http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-articles/article-i-the-legislative-branch)—the longest article of the Constitution—describes congressional powers. Congress has the power to:

* Make laws
* Declare war
* Raise and provide public money and oversee its proper expenditure
* Impeach and try federal officers
* Approve presidential appointments
* Approve treaties negotiated by the executive branch
* Oversight and investigations

##How a Bill Become a Law?

As laid out above, one of the primary tasks of Congress is to make laws to govern the United States. However, many people do not fully understand the process by which that happens. Here are two options for learning about the process:

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 1: Whitehouse.gov**

For those of you who appreciate a more official explanation, here is the  legislative process as laid out by [whitehouse.gov.](http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/legislative-branch) There is no way that I can hope to write something more detailed or accurate than the information provided there, so simply click on the link and read away.

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 2: Schoolhouse Rock!**

Many of you will recall the old Schoolhouse Rock! videos from your youth and they do a great job communicating important information in a simple and easy to digest way. Click the link below to watch.

&amp;nbsp;

**[I'm just a bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0)**

&amp;nbsp;

Here are a few terms that you might not fully understand that were mentioned in the video:

* [Bill:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#bill)

&gt; A legislative proposal which would make law if it passes both the House and Senate and if it receives Presidential approval.

&gt; Bills are introduced as ""H.R."" in the House, and as ""S."" in the Senate. Besides bills, joint resolutions are the only other type of legislation which makes law. They are designated as H.J.Res. in the House and S.J.Res. in the Senate.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

To review current bills pending before Congress, visit the [THOMAS website.](http://thomas.loc.gov/home/LegislativeData.php?&amp;n=BSS&amp;c=108) *Please note: THOMAS is closing soon. Make the switch to [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov)*

&amp;nbsp;

* [Committee:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#Committees) 

&gt; Committees are panels of the House or Senate, created to do the initial review of proposed legislation, and decide which measures are worthy of further consideration by the full House or Senate. The committees are each assigned various policy categories to handle, known as jurisdiction.

&gt; The House and Senate each have about 20 permanent standing committees. The House and Senate also have select committees, and joint committees. 

&gt; Every Representative in the House is assigned to work on an average of two committees; while Senators are assigned to an average of four. Members are expected to become specialists in the subject matter under their committee""s jurisdiction.

&amp;nbsp;

You can check out each Congressional Committee [here.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/) 

The site gives you information about which representatives and senators are on each committee, who chairs the committee, information about the purpose of the committee (along with a link to their specific website), and you can choose to sign up and track their activity as well. 

&amp;nbsp;

* [Law:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#Law)

&gt; Legislation passed by both the House and Senate in identical form and signed by the President, or passed over his veto. 

&gt; Public Laws affect the nation as a whole; Private Laws affect only one individual or legal entity [such as a single corporation].

&amp;nbsp;

* [Veto:](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#veto)

&gt; The action taken by the President returning a bill to Congress with a message explaining why he refuses to sign it into law. To override his veto and allow the bill to become law anyway, both the House and Senate must pass the bill again, but this time with a 2/3 vote - if all are present that is 290 votes in the House and 67 votes in the Senate.

&amp;nbsp;

##Pork Barrel Legislation

First, let's get [the definition](http://72.32.58.69/learn_about/feature/congressional_glossary.php#PorkBarrel) out of the way:

&gt; The term began as a political reference in the post-Civil War era. It comes from the plantation practice of distributing rations of salt pork to slaves from wooden barrels.

&gt; When used to describe a bill, it implies the legislation is loaded with special projects for Members of Congress to distribute to their constituents back home, courtesy of the federal taxpayer.

&amp;nbsp;

[Wendy McElroy gives a pretty good rundown of the history of pork-barrel legislation in her article at fff.org:](http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/pork-barrel-spending-the-history-of-lipsticking-pigs/)

Pork barrel legislation started in the first Congress, however it did not become a widespread occurrence until the 1980s. Proponents for pork barrel, reference [Article 1 - Section 8 of the Constitution](http://constitutioncenter.org/constitution/the-articles/article-i-the-legislative-branch) for its justification. Specifically, there are two clauses which are commonly used to advocate its legitimacy:

* The General-Welfare Clause:

&gt; “The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.” Pork is said to provide for general welfare, and thus to be permitted by this clause.

* The Postal Clause:

&gt; which authorizes Congress “to establish post offices and post roads” as a way to expedite interstate communication. This is now construed to give the federal government the power to appropriate money for public works.

The first Congress (1790) authorized pork in the form of $1,500 to complete a lighthouse in Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts. The expenditure had the active support of President George Washington and of Rep. George Thatcher of Massachusetts.

While the first Congress did authorize pork, it was by no means a common occurrence. The next attempt at passing pork-barrel legislation was under the second Congress and it was rejected because politicians feared that it would set a ""dangerous precedent.""  

In 1817, President Madison vetoed an earmark aimed at funding a national system of roads and waterways because he did not believe the general-welfare clause permitted it. He concluded that “special-interest issues like internal improvements inexorably corrupted the legislative process.”

The next president, James Monroe, vetoed a bill to construct a national road. Unlike Madison, he believed the Constitution empowered Congress to appropriate funds, but he argued for an explicit amendment covering internal improvements. Monroe wanted federal power “confined to great national works only, since if it were unlimited it would be liable to abuse and might be productive of evil.” Anything other than “great national works” were the responsibility of the individual states.

It appears that pork-barrel legislation did not become common until the mid 1980s;

Between FY [fiscal year] 1985 and FY 1999, the growth in annual earmarks increased substantially faster — between 25 to 1,000 times faster in most cases — than inflation-adjusted federal domestic discretionary spending.… The number of earmarks in five of the 13 appropriations bills doubled between FY 1998 and FY 1999. [Source: Heritage.org](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1999/04/congressional-earmarks-and-spending-undermine-decisionmaking)

&amp;nbsp;

And now for some charts to illustrate the points above:

* [Number and cost of earmarks by fiscal year 1991 - 2010](http://imgur.com/1Rb0FAg)

* [Growth in appropriations earmarks from fiscal year 1985 - 1999](http://imgur.com/LLdIvC3)

While there is no denying that pork-barrel spending has become more prolific in today's Congress, you should also be aware that it does not actually involve that much of the national spending. According to [factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2007/12/pork-barrel-spending/), pork-barrel spending made up about 1% of the national spending in 2007.

&amp;nbsp;

##Money and Congress

It is no secret that money plays a major role in Congress. Money in politics has grown significantly over the past 50 years;

[According to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress_and_citizens), In 1971, the cost of running for congress in Utah was $70,000. Since then, campaign costs have climbed. The biggest campaign expense is television ads, although campaign staff and materials are expensive too. By 1986, the average Senate race cost $3 million; average House races cost $350,000. By 1994, the cost to run for a congressional seat was about $500,000 on average. In the 2008 election, spending for all campaigns (including presidential) approached $2 billion in early 2008. In recent years, the average victor in a Senate race spent close to $7 million, and the average House victor spent over a million dollars.

[Opensecrets.org](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/11/money-wins-white-house-and/) states that, The average cost of winning a House race in 2008 was nearly $1.1 million, based on pre-election finance reports, and almost $6.5 million for a Senate seat.

Opensecrets.org allows you to look at the cost of a seat in Congress in more detail [here.](https://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/stats.php)

##How Members of Congress Spend Their Time

But what does this all mean for our Congressmen and women? Well it means that they have to spend more time fundraising and less time working for their constituents.

In January 2013, Huffington Post released two images from a powerpoint presentation given to new members of Congress by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee;

* The first image outlines a typical day for members of Congress who are in DC. [Image here.](http://imgur.com/yf0568x)

* The second image outlines a typical day for members of Congress who are in their home districts. [Image here.](http://imgur.com/RgDILzi)

You can read the full HufingtonPost article about this [here.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/08/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291.html)

The WashingtonPost also published a story about fundraising in Congress in July 2013 and specifically discusses some of the claims made in the HuffingtonPost article. You can read the WashingtonPost article [here.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/29/congress-spends-too-much-time-fundraising-but-its-less-time-than-you-think/) 

In the WashingtonPost article, the author agrees that fundraising does take up a lot of Congress's time, but not so much as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee powerpoint suggests that it should. 

&gt; [it is] possible that there's huge variation in how much time members of Congress spend fundraising. That DCCC schedule might hold true for a new members from a contested district. But House incumbents typically have a 90 percent reelection rate. Most of them are in safe districts. A lot of the money they raise goes to the party rather than to them. They're not going to spend most of their day doing something they hate.

[The Congressional Management Foundation conducted a survey](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/life-in-congress/the-member-perspective), asking working members of Congress how they spent their time. [The survey results are here.](http://imgur.com/Aov0EfD)

In the survey, fundraising falls under the broad category of ""political/campaign work"". And both when members are in Washington and when they're at home, they report that all political/campaign work takes up less than a fifth of their time -- and only part of that is fundraising. 

According to the same survey, which was published in 2013:

&gt; When in Washington, D.C., Members reported spending their time as follows:

&gt; * 35% on “Legislative/Policy Work”

&gt; * 17% on “Constituent Services Work”

&gt; * 17% on “Political/Campaign Work”

&gt; * 9% on “Press/Media Relations”

&gt; * 9% with “Family/Friends”

&gt; * 7% on “Administrative/Managerial Work”

&gt; * 6% on “Personal Time”


And

&gt; When in their congressional districts, Members reported spending their time as follows:

&gt; * 32% on “Constituent Services Work”

&gt; * 18% on “Political/Campaign Work”

&gt; * 14% on “Press/Media Relations”

&gt; * 12% on “Legislative/Policy Work”

&gt; * 9% with “Family/Friends”

&gt; * 8% on “Personal Time”

&gt; * 7% on “Administrative/Managerial Work”


Additionally, members of Congress report working most weekends out of the year and anywhere between 50 to 70 hours a week depending on whether or not Congress is in session.

So even though Congress may not always be in session, your Congressmen and women are still likely working hard on behalf of their constituents, or if you are more pessimistic - working towards their re-election and on behalf of their corporate sponsors.

My previous (right out of school) employer had me on the road, a lot, and rent was not an issue as my company paid for my accommodations. This allowed me to pay off a small chunk of my student loan and get some money in the bank.

Facing an impending layoff due to lack of work with changing seasons, I jumped ship and am now working a job I actually quite enjoy in my home town. I am currently living with my parents, which is not a long-term option. I am hoping to be moving out about two weeks ago. 

The issue is I live in a small city where you can pay 4-500 dollars for rent in the…less desirable neighbourhoods, or 7-900 in the nicer neighbourhoods. There is very little available in between those price ranges (5-700), and when it pops up it is always in the less desirable neighbourhoods, or gone by the time I can see the unit. I am not opposed to living with a roommate (two bedroom apartments in nice areas run about 7-1000), but I would rather have my own place, and then find a suitable roommate.

I'm asking for help, please. I know what I can afford, but I'm not sure what I SHOULD afford, all while accommodating my future, loan payments, a life, etc.. Also, what should I do with the money in my bank account? Keep it for a rainy day? Pay a chunk of my loan?

I exhausted my federal and state options and opted to go with the Citizens Bank Trufit Loan.  My cosigner and I signed and finalized the loan in the beginning of September.  The loans have been disbursed to the school but my refund for additional expenses has not been disbursed to me yet.

My cosigner unexpectedly died 2 weeks ago, and I've been so distraught and busy that I hadn't thought about how this would impact my loan.  Many sources online say that lots of loans will default if the cosigner dies even if all payments are being made on time.  In my agreement it says that if the cosigner dies, I will still be responsible for all payments, but there is also a list of things which ""may"" cause the loan to default.  Cosigner death is one of the things on the list.  

I am young and have very little experience with this.  Does anyone have a similar experience or with the Citizens Bank Trufit loan in particular?  What should I expect to happen?  Will my loan definitely default?  Am I supposed to inform Citizens Bank of the death or will they already know?

I don't know of any other qualified cosigners so I am very worried about what will happen with my education.  I am almost done and it will delay me of my loan is taken away.

I'd like to know if having a bit wallet is really worth it and if it's something like PayPal or is it something like DA point system? Does it involve credit? Does it involve stocks or dividends?

personalfinance,My experience as a first time car buyer (24f),"Hello PF! I wanted to share my car buying experience. I used the advice from here on PF and other car buying guides to figure this all out. This is for for those who are inexperienced like me who would liked to read about another's experiences. (disclaimer: I am by no means an expert or a professional. ) 

This weekend I bought a new 2015 Honda Fit LX automatic for $16,432. Dealerships are trying to sell it for $17,115. This isn't thousands off dollars off but I am really proud of it!

I decided to buy new for a variety of reasons. One primary reason is that I am going to keep this car for as long as I can so I don't mind investing in it... and I really wanted that new car feel after driving beaters. This isn't /r/financialindepence so I hope this is welcome here.

My steps (in no particular order):

1. Find the price for all the extra fees and I need to pay to find out my real budget

2. Research to find the car that fit my needs the most

3. Get a quote online

4. Get approve for a loan

5. Leg work to see if people would beat my deal

6. The big day: finally putting it all together

7. Stick to my guns

Here are the steps fleshed out:

1) So, the first thing I did was a ton of research. I found out [which fees I should pay and which I would definitely not pay.](http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/what-fees-should-you-pay.html) I live in California, so I found out that I only had to pay up to $80 in documentation fees, average of $244 in registration fees, sales tax should not exceed 10%. Knowing almost the exact dollar amount is really important as I will explain further down.


2) After that, I researched what cars I wanted. I compared New vs Used vs. CPO.  Two websites that really helped me weigh the pros and cons were [Fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov/) and [US News Best Cars.](http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/Affordable-Small-Cars.) 


3) Once I narrowed down the car, I went online to find the lowest price. I went to so many that I don't know how I found the deal that I took. But the 'internet manager' was emailing me from a dealership and was actually offering me around the price that Kelly Blue Book. So I think I secured a price going through Kelly Blue Book.


4) I applied at a local credit union to find the best loan for me. I was approved for 1.99 for 48 months from the first place I applied at. Great, no need to shop around. But I tried USAA where I am insured at and was approved for a 3.49% loan. Both USAA and the credit union offered to find me the lowest deal on a car. Credit Union loan had no early payment fees or terms that made me pay all of the interest. It was an amortized loan, but I think most are. This means that I pay more interest in the beginning of the loan than I do at the end. This safeguards the loan company if I decide to pay it off early. 


5) Saturday I decided to devote it to going to local dealerships to see if they would match or beat my quote because the dealership was far away. None would. They offered me $17,100 and some went as low at 16,900 if I promised to buy the 7 year warranty for $1800. But I learned quite a bit. They also tried to throw at me that the car was so hot I would miss out on a deal. But the sale associate who was helping me messed up by bringing me to where they hold their cars on the rooftop parking lot. I counted at least 5 fits and 3 were LX. 

&gt;Manager ""these cars are going fast! you'll lose out on this deal!""
&gt;lil-aud ""really? why did I count at least 5 on your rooftop then?""


I also learned that although the price was guaranteed, the dealership would coerce me to pay for other stuff. One of the sales managers at the local dealership was nice enough to fill me in on the scams, like adding unnecessary warranties, security systems, and accessories.. I read the terms and conditions of my internet quote and it said that destination fees and advertising were included in the price but that it does not include *dealer installed accessories.*

So I called the dealership where I got the quote from and spoke with their floor sales manager (everyone is a manager at dealerships.. talk about too many chiefs in the tee-pee.) I asked her what the cars come packaged with. She said only a $20 window decal or something like that. I forgot, because the most important fact was that whatever it is *only cost $20.* I also found out they had 3 white Honda Fit LX in stock. 


6) My boyfriend drives me to the dealership at 9:30am so that we would have all day devoted to it. And we needed all the time; it took over 2 hours despite having everything already figured out.

I test drove the car I wanted. It was beautiful. We don't have to hassle over price, which is great. So we get down to the meat of it: the break down of the prices. He has on a ""pro-package"" for $795. *Woah woah woah. Hold the press.* I very politely asked him what the heck that was about. We went back and forth about how I refused to buy anything extra. I mean come on! Mud flap protection for my tires?? This is a honda fit. I live in LA. There is no mud here because it doesn't rain and I'm not going off-roading in this car. (been there done that.. got my car's axle stuck on a rock in the desert. long story.)

We went back and forth and he kept saying ""she told you that? only $20?"" They tried to 'discount' it for $500 but I refused. Once they realized I would not budge they took it off. I finally only had tax, doc fees, and registration. Needless to say, I was a happy camper.

Then we go to financing. I had a sizable down payment ($8000) but still needed to finance 11k. I told him he had to beat my credit union loan offers. So he pulls out a sheet of paper that lists the monthly payments, etc. He actually could match them with a few that were slightly different months or interest rate. My boyfriend who is silent at this point pulls out his phone to compare interest rates to see if changing the months or rate would help me save more money. And we found out that **his interest rates were wrong!** for the 1.99% interest rate they tried to charge me $244 when it actually came out to $237 and some change. That is a discrepancy of 7 bucks a month! What the hell? He may have been trying to tack on a monthly price for a warranty or car alarm system. They are so shady! I could not believe it.

I am a little ashamed that I took their loan instead of my loan even though they were the same loan. I was hungry because I skipped breakfast. But I just wanted to finish quickly so I could finally eat. 

So important recap:

A. check the fine print to figure out what they can charge you with.

b. make sure what they say they will charge actually adds up to what they are actually charging you

c. eat before-hand


7) Even after all that and after we shook hands, they still tried to sell me on warranties and car alarm systems. The alarm systems are over priced so I would never get it done at the dealership. I just said no and signed all the paperwork. 


They were nice in the end and filled up my tank at a gas station (is this standard practice?)

I learned so much this weekend. I am so glad it is over! But I did learn that diligence pays off.

**TL;DR**

1. do ALL the research

2. buy a new car

3. ?  ?  ?

4. profit

Seriously, I think the most valuable lesson I learned was being meticulous in reading all the fine print and in adding up all the costs to make sure I am not getting ripped off.",finance,1412106769
personalfinance,Making up for my past,"I'm about to turn 30 and have only recently gotten serious about making up for the financial mistakes of my youth. Let me introduce you to my current financial picture.

The Good:

* I'm employed and make a decent income
* I've been using You Need A Budget since January and have just achieved Rule 4 (Live on last month's income)
* I'm in good health

The Bad:

Lots of debt. In particular,

* 50K in federal student loans (Mohela)
* 4.8K in private student loans (Sallie Mae)
* 9.5K in credit card debt (First Financial Bank USA)

The Ugly:

I'm fine with the student debt, since it financed my education and the rates are reasonable I suppose. But back when my student loans kicked in I ran from them and hid for so long that the Department of Education sold the debt to Mohela. After hiding from Mohela for a while, I finally confronted the loans, and am now paying a nominal monthly payment that barely makes a dent, but it keeps me current.

The credit card debt hangs on me pretty heavily. I don't know how I even came to have it. I think when I was in college my mom recommended I have one for emergencies, and I ended up relying on it during a few periods of unemployment and just watched the balance grow. The balance itself is minor compared to my student loans, but the kicker is that the interest rate is... 29.9%. This figure for a few years was just something I considered a fact of life, but now I just think it's insane.

Like I said, I want to be proactive. I think it would be best to start with this credit card debt. I once tried to get a personal loan from my bank, but was declined due to poor credit (all those missed payments). A couple years later, my credit's still not great. And I'm concerned that if I apply for a balance transfer credit card or a personal loan either a) I'll be declined or b) even if approved it won't be enough to wipe out the 9.5K in one go, and I'll have one more source of debt in my life.

So at this point, needless to say, I welcome any and all advice. I go to /r/Frugal and /r/ynab as well as here, so I have a good grasp on how to save money on a day to day basis. But I'd love to hear about specific solutions to beating down this credit card debt.

Edit:

Further details (monthly):

Income: 2500

Budget:

* rent 500
* cable/internet 150 (I'd cut the cable but girlfriend insists on having it.)
* food 150
* iphone 150 (It's high but in a couple months I'll go on a family plan with my girlfriend which will help. But I am also considering ditching this current plan altogether.)
* electric 50
* financed couch 50
* transit pass 100
* day to day 500

Debts:

* credit card 250, 29%
* federal loans 100, ~8%
* private loans 100, ~7%

This should leave around 400. My previous savings helped me to beat YNAB Rule #4, so I'm planning to start building my savings back up.",finance,1412109180

dogecoin,Just Changed My Mind About Doge And Not Happy About It,"I was just about to build a machine and start mining doge, and planning to buy a few hundred thousand doge to get a head start.  I was going to do it because Doge has this amazing community of young, positive, optimistic redditers who are tireless in promoting the 'brand'.  I see huge long term potential in it.  Doge is Reddits crypto-currency puppy.  It was born here, it was promoted here, it was grown here and fed here and housed here.  It was trained on reddit and it's future is tied to reddit.  

Then, today, I see the news.  Reddit is starting it's own crypto, and it's going to pay redditers to use it and pay redditers who submit content in this new (let's call it) alienredditcoin thing.  Alienredditcoin thing is going to take over the energy of reddit now.  

Why worry about doge, mine the reddit coin.  Why submit in /r/dogecoin, submissions in the big subs will yield larger returns in, you guessed it, alienredditcoin thing.  

They are essentially eating their puppydoge.  They see the positive energy of this community and big money got together and said ""we can do this, but we can afford to give away more and beat them at their own game"".  They are going to leverage the power of reddit, not for doge, but for them.  They're hoping, I think that this coin becomes a competitor to bitcoin itself, because it's attached to a real world internet powerhouse, and when unsuspecting non-crypto people contribute about XYZ they get a little of this alienredditcoin thing and become adopters.  That's a lot like what Doge has done, except now it's big and corporate and official and Doge is just a subreddit.  How can our puppy dog possibly compete with Yishan Wong himself, not to mention Thiel and Altman and all those powerhouses behind alienredditcoin thing?

personalfinance,Am I working too much overtime? Federal tax reasons,"Let me start off with some quick stats about my income. 
I work an hourly supervisor job in Massachusetts. 
My hourly rate up to 40hrs is 15$, and my overtime rate is 22.50$. 

When I signed on for the job, they originally had me ready for a salary of 46k, but offered to give me unlimited overtime for my first few weeks while paperwork went through. I started for my company on February 1st, and have been working 20+ hours of overtime every week. It is almost October now, and I'm still working at my hourly rate. I don't know much about federal tax brackets, but I'm starting to get worried about my federal and state tax returns getting effected. 

I've claimed 0 for both federal and state, and so far I've made about 40k and have had about 6500 withheld for my federal tax, and 2500 for my state. I've asked my boss if the constant overtime is going to end up screwing me in the long run, but he assures me that I will only benefit from all the extra hours, and my tax returns will be huge.

personalfinance,Brother's Financial Advisor strongly recommended Whole Life Insurance. Is this his best option? Please help!,"**Intro**

My brother's financial advisor is strongly recommending he pick up Whole Life insurance. Based off of reading we did online (including this subreddit) we thought perhaps it wasn't the best idea. He is asking his advisor to cancel the account but the advisor is still pressuring him saying this is his best option and it would be a mistake to do anything else instead. 

I am asking this question for my brother because I also recently starting consulting with this advisor last week.

---

**Info about my brother**

He is 20 years old and is a college student just starting his junior year. He has no dependents. He's getting his company match for 401K and has opened an IRA (not maxing out currently).

---
**What is financial advisor is saying**

My brother is being told that he needs a ""guaranteed bucket"" of money to be able to pull from in case the market goes through a recession (which history tells us is likely). My brother has no need for life insurance right now as he has no dependents. The Whole Life insurance is being used as an investment vehicle to provide the ""guaranteed return"".

The financial advisor has informed my brother he can come up with four options to use this $100 a month that he is recommending be put towards whole life insurance

---

**Option 1 - Buy CDs**

The advisor recommends not buying these since the return rate is below 2%

**Option 2 - Invest the 100 into the Roth IRA instead of guranteed low risk account**

The advisor says that as he gets older he will need to switch his portfolio to either bonds or whole life or CDs once he maxes out IRA. He thinks CD's and Bonds are risky because the interest rates are too low and the debt of government is too high likely leading to a bubble. He says CDs and bonds aren't actually guaranteed. In addition, the sooner he get's whole life the cheaper it is. If he waits later then his rates go up. He is saying whole life is the only way he can get a guaranteed contract value, even if they pay no dividends he has stored cash at 2% way tax-deferred.

**Option 3 - Bond Fund**

He says all the way back to 1988 there would not have been a return higher than 4% and his portfolio could collapse in retirement or near retirement due to a bad market. He is not recommending this option at all.

**Option 4 - Whole Life**

Recommends this due to guaranteed bucket. He says the 30 year IRR is projected at 4.1%.

---

He's stating that the things we are reading on the internet are written by English majors not financial advisors so we need to keep this in mind.

The reading we've done is 100% against this, but the advisor is still insisting he should keep the whole life policy.

Any advice you can give is greatly appreciated. I've learned a lot from this community and am certain someone has the knowledge to contribute to the conversation here.

I will live pretty cheaply, as in I've bought everything I need to move out here and don't need anything else other than what was outlined in my monthly bills, if it means paying off my debt sooner. Student loans I'm not overly concerned with paying off immediately, but getting them paid off in 5 years would be great.

personalfinance,When to pay off subsidized student loans,"So I've gone through the FAQ and I believe my situation is not quite covered there. I'm a 3rd year graduate student making $38k a year, before tax (also I do not have to pay social security tax on this). Through a good amount of discipline over the past 2 years I have payed off $12k of unsubsidized loans and a $20k, 5% interested automobile loan. My only debts left to pay off are $30k in subsidized loans, which under my budget I could feasable do before I graduate in two years.

However, these loans are subsidized while I am in graduate school, and won't accrue interest of the next 2 years. After that, the interest rates are split at about 8%, 6%, and 4% with $10k in each bracket.

My question is, what should I be doing with the roughly $30k I've budgeted over the next two years to pay my loans off? The simple answer is just pay it monthly, or hold on to it in a savings account to pay off all the loans right after I graduate. But some other things I thought of have been:

-Opening a Roth IRA and putting $5500 a year into it (makes sense given the roughly $10k of 4% loans)
-Investing the money in some form of indexed fund
-Something else?

Thanks for any suggestions.
