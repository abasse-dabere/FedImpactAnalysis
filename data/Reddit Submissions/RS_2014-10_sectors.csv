personalfinance,I'm slowly accumulating more and more debt and I don't know how to stop it.,"I am 24, I have two part time jobs and am a semi-full time university student.  I've been in debt one way or another for most of my life. Whenever I asked for something from my parents that I couldn't afford when I was about 14-17, I would receive it but the monetary value would go on a ""tab"" my mother kept and I would pay her back whenever I could.

This is probably the single contributing factor into how I spend my money now. I have two credit cards, a Visa and a MC, and a student loan.  Currently, besides my student loan balance, I am approximately $14,000 in personal debt.  I convince myself most times I get stressed out about it and think, ""it could be worse, a lot of people are tens of thousands of dollars in debt so I'm doing alright."" 
This attitude towards my situation is pushing me further and further into a debt that I cannot seem to get myself out of. My significant other has no idea that I owe this much and if my mother found out she may or may not have a heart attack before and after she killed me.

I just started university this September and plan to complete a four year degree.  I stopped working full-time and that has started to put a lot of pressure on meeting my monthly payments each month.  I have tried to set up a budget on excel too many times to count and as much as I wish that would work for me, it seems hopeless to try that again.  I know I spend too much and at the rate I am making money now, I'm more scared of the possible risk to my financial future I may be making.

My MasterCard is thankfully at a very low interest rate, 5.99%. It has the largest owing balance of a little over $10,000. My first thought is continuing to pay my statements and put as much money as possible on my Visa balance: $4000, as it's about 19-20% interest.  I did try this in the past and it didn't work out for me because I did it alone without any support.

My last resort is having someone else in control of my money entirely.  I would have no primary access to my money whatsoever and if I want to buy anything, I have to ask and hopefully get talked out of. The only problem with that is I don't know who in my life I feel comfortable being this person.  And, obviously, I cannot afford to hire someone legally to do it for me. I really hope to get a handle on this and want to eliminate the possibility of it getting worse.
I would appreciate any ideas, thoughts, personal stories you wish to share or any general words of encouragement.

personalfinance,Who do I talk to about options for consolidating my student loans?,"I have been out of college for just over a year. As I watch posts on personalfinance go by, and as I talk to my peers who have also exited college with loans, I haven't met anyone with a higher interest rate than I (~$30k spread among 7 loans, with rates from 5 to 6.5%). Additionally, I see things like home loans, car loans, etc, with dramatically lower interest rates than my student loans.

The idea of refinancing my loans *and* consolidating them into one loan with a lower interest rate is appealing.

In the FAQ, I found this page: https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/consolidation which mostly seems to speak about consolidating loans to achieve a lower monthly payment. I would not take consolidation as an opportunity to pay less per month (just the opposite, in fact: I've been slowly increasing my payments since graduation) - rather, I want to lessen the amount of interest I end up paying in the long run.

My question is: Where can I look to find a financial advisor/expert to help me figure out what (or if) to do, who is both qualified and has my best interests in mind?

For example, I could ask my father - I trust him, but he's not a loan authority, student or otherwise. I could ask my bank - but I'm not sure I trust that their assessment of my situation will be unbiased.

personalfinance,$300K in student loan debt-- looking for assistance ($160K salary),"**How:** I went to an Ivy league undergrad and an Ivy League law school without any scholarships. 

**Currently owe:** $300K in federal student loans

**Salary:** $160K (after taxes in NYC, take-home is $90K)

I am currently signed up for IBR (low monthly payments) since my salary last year was $30K. IBR will last for one year before I have to switch to a typical 10-year plan.


Here are the loans amounts, interest rates, and payments for standard 10-year and IBR:

**LOAN A:** $40K (8.25%)
(Standard 10-year: $469, IBR :$38)

**LOAN B:** $165K (7.65%)
(Standard 10-year:$1925, IBR: $161)

**LOAN C:** $25K (6.55%)
(Standard 10-year:$274,IBR: $24)

**LOAN D:** $70K (6.55%)
(Standard 10-year:$773, IBR: $71)

Since I will be on IBR for one year, how can I use that to help with my situation? I was thinking of taking the $40K loan with the highest interest rate (Loan A) and transferring it to SoFi at a very low variable interest rate (3-4%) and paying it off in one year (I can put about $4K to loans per month). I would leave loans (B,C,and D) with the federal provider and pay the IBR amount each month. Then after one year when Loan A is paid off, I would do the regular repayment plan with Loans B,C,D. However, I’m wondering if there’s no point in moving the $40K loan to SoF (the interest rate difference may be negligible since I’m paying it all in one year). 

I'm also wondering if it's a mistake to throw all my money at the $40K loan with the highest interest rate (Loan A) while only paying the IBR amounts on the other loans for a year. Is this the most cost-effective strategy?

(I did not want to move all $300K to SoFi because I would lose all federal benefits if something happened).

Any advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated!",finance,1412124241

personalfinance,Help in choosing my first Savings Account. (AUSTRALIA),"Hi! Aussie here but any advice from anyone, anywhere would be greatly appreciated! =)

So I am currently still in uni and just landed myself a part-time job. I have two years to go with my current course and would like to have some savings at the end of it for a car. But really, I just want to (finally) start saving up for the long run. Perhaps even for a home deposit. (maybe)

This is my first time setting up an online savings account so I may seem a bit naive - sorry!

I have done a bit of research and shopping around. So far, I think I should aim for an account that has the highest interest possible with no monthly transaction and account maintenance fees. Account access and Customer service doesn't seem to be my main priority. But I really don't know!

I found the ""Bankwest Hero Saver"" to be quite attractive with a variable interest rate of 4.0% and has no monthly maintenance and account fees. No minimum initial deposit (yay!). I can have ATM access (and they are everywhere!). It doesn't allow me to withdraw but I am not planning to touch the money any time soon. So no biggie. Am I overlooking some important details here? Sorry for my naiveness. 

I am planning to deposit between $300-$400 off my fortnightly pay into the account so $600-$800 a month. As, I said, I want to save up for a car after 2 years but really I just want to have a savings account up and running. 

So am I over looking some important factors?

I am with the Commonwealth for my everyday account and their ""Netbank Savers"" savings account is 2.5% (standard) + 1.31% (for 3 months) = 3.81% but comes with more account access - which I do not need. I just want to have the most savings at the end as possible.

I honestly am quite lost with the amount of choice. So any advice, tips and experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thanks everyone!",finance,1412135316

So, I am currently in my 5th year of college going for my Bachelors. I went to community to save money then I transferred to Temple University. I usually am eligible for FAFSA because my parents don't make that much money. My mother is the only one that works and my father collects rent from the houses he owns.

The problem is: the government says that my family made too much money this year.  My mother made around $40,000 and my father's assests pretty much makes us ""rich"". But that's not the case. I had taken out a loan for my parents to pay off my dad's gambling debt, which was around $20,000. But then my parents found out the interest rate was pretty high, so my mother took out a loan from her 401k to pay that back in full and started working overtime because they were taking payments directly from her paychecks.  So in reality, after taxes, health benefits and the 401k loan, she was making $250-$400 per paycheck (which was biweekly). Meanwhile, my bum father, collects rent from 5 houses that he owns but does not contribute to the family at all. He's stingy and greedy with his money. He's extremely... aggressive, when it comes to money, so my mother would rather not deal with it and try stand on her own.

Temple University basically says that I am to pay the whole tuition myself or get loans. I have almost reached my max loans I can withdraw while in the University (not including Parent Plus), which is around $31,000.  I wanted to know if there was anything else I could do? To be honest I am not on good academic standing, as a result I had recently switched from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science.  As of now, I need $12,000 to pay Temple University for my 2014-2015 semester. I'm unsure of how to get this money, I would rather not take the Parent Plus but if I have to, I will. I just wanted to know if there was any other option out there.

Oh, my expected Graduation date is Fall 2016. I just need to tough it out for two more years but I'm not even sure how to pay for this year, let alone next year.

personalfinance,Is a reasonable goal to own an apartment at the age of 20?,"Hi guys!

So I am a 20 year old female from Canada, and I am preparing to move to Sweden to both be with my longterm significant other as well as be entitled to free schooling due to my EU Citizenship. My significant other and I are both very young, I have lived on my own before but he hasn't. I obviously have never owned my own home.

We have decided the most convenient and financially intelligent thing to do is to purchase an apartment outright. Renting takes years to be on the waitlist, and renting secondhand does not seem smart because the monthly rent is high and you're essentially putting your money into nothing. We are not dumb people, any apartment we will be looking at will be a ways away from the larger cities and certainly will not be spacious, best case scenario is two rooms so we can get away from each other sometimes. 

The maximum purchase I think we can make is an apartment that costs 400,000 kr (about 63,000 CAD.) It's not much but on blocket.se (Kind of like a nicer version of Craigslist) there are indeed apartments for that much. My significant other got some information about owning apartments which may have gotten lost in translation after it got to me but in order to purchase off of Blocket, you must pay 15% of the apartment price outright and the rest may be loaned to you from your bank. I have no idea about interest rates on your loan or anything like that, partially because I am a stupid 20 year old who knows nothing about financing and partially because my boyfriend said there *is* no interest rate. As socialist as Sweden is, I'm pretty sure he just doesn't understand what I mean in English and there is some catch to this.

I am a smart person, I will be living within my means and will manage to save perhaps $500-700/month to put towards savings and/or paying off our loan. I can talk about my salary/budget information if someone is that interested in my post because I understand saving that much monthly is probably not realistic for many people. I mean maybe it isn't, I'm an idiot looking for financial advice.

So am I a *complete* idiot or is it possible for me to own an apartment at such a young age?",finance,1412144332

(22m)","*Disclaimer: This all happened in Jan. 2014, and while I should've wrote about my story then while it was fresh on my mind, I didn't and so I'm working off of 9-month-old memories, so I apologize if something doesn't seem clear or seems confusing. Also, all tips I state are not guaranteed to work. These are just things I learned from my car-buying experience that I thought would be helpful to others, probably moreso for other college grads.*

First off, some background about me and the situation. I had previously owned a 2001 Ford Escape (and by owned, I mean my parents owned it and they gave me permission to drive it ha) which would eventually break down on me with a bad transmission. With the repair costs of that being at least $3000 and given the chances of the car needing costly repairs soon again being very high, it was best for me to consider buying a brand new car.  

My financial situation at the time: I was a senior in college with a $60k-salary job offer waiting upon graduation in June, but in the meantime not currently employed with a few thousand in savings. My dad used to be a car salesman/own a dealership, which going into the car hunt, was one advantage I had that the average person did not. He knows all the tricks that car salesmen do, as well as ways to approach just about any car-buying situation, and in my case, the first step was seeing which car companies had special offers for students, specifically college grads. I didn't know it at the time and it's not very highly advertised but car companies (through official dealers) tend to always have special deals for college grads, whether it's low interest rates, delayed payments (e.g. don't have to pay until you graduate), or a couple thousand off the sticker price of a car. These companies tend to have these specials on their websites but again, they're not highly advertised. You're not likely to see them in commercials or posted on the front page of their websites, so it's probably best to Google something like ""Ford student deals"" and see what comes up.  

**Part 1: Negotiating the Car**
==================  

Throughout the whole car-buying process, it's best for me to note that I always kept a poker face as a potential customer, so keep this in mind.

Now I'm not a great car fanatic, I just wanted something good on gas with a couple of other features (push to start, bluetooth, etc.) and eventually my car of choice was a 2014 Nissan Sentra. Luckily for me, I had come to the dealership just as they had taken it off the truck, and aside from the 1 mile the salesman put on there when he went to fill it up with gas, I can honestly say every single mile on that car was driven by me, for after test driving it (it was the last car I test drove out of the ones I was deciding on), I had basically committed myself to buying it. Nissan's student discount at the time (for that dealership) was delayed payments, so I wouldn't have to pay a car note until graduation (which was about 5 months), which was great for someone like me who only had savings and no income at the moment.   

Here's where my dad's tips came in.   

To a car salesman, there's 3 types of customers: the lookers (""Oh we're just browsing for today, nothing serious""), the undecided (""I want a car, but I'm not sure what kind or what features""), and the confident (""I'm here to buy the 2014 XYZ in black with these features, do you have it or no?""). A salesman is willing to put in more energy/time towards a confident buyer as opposed to the other two because of the higher chance they'll make a sale. So try to do as much research on the cars you want to look at before heading to the dealership. It'll make you seem like a much more serious buyer and it'll force the salesman to change up their strategy a bit.

In my mind, I already knew the Sentra was the car I wanted, but **don't visibly let the salesman know that**. Here's where that poker face comes in. Keep them guessing about your interest in the car, but at the same time, keep them hopeful from the start, saying phrases like ""We're here to buy a car *today*"" or ""I don't plan to leave without keys in my hand"", something to let them know you are serious about actually buying a car either that day or within the next couple of days. It lets the salesman know that if they play their cards right they can have you as a buying customer.  

At this point, if it were up to me, I'd go ahead and sign the papers right then and there, but my dad told me to wait. His plan? Walk away. Act as if you have other cars you want to look at at other dealerships (which may or may not be true for you anyway), but always make the salesman think that the sale is not a done deal yet. Me and my dad left, not to go to another dealership, but to go home for part 2 of our car buying ""adventure"", if you may.  

**Part 2: Negotiating the Price**
====================

Before we continue, let's talk about the pricing of a car, specifically, the fees.  

Say a car's sticker price total is $15,000. But if you look at the details of that sticker, it has a bunch of fees added on (shipping fee, stocking fee, some other bullshit fee) where the car originally like $14,000 or so before adding in those fees. My dad said there's a specific term they call those fees in the car industry, but since I forgot that term, let's just call them *nonsense fees*. **The majority of those fees can be negotiated out of the sticker price.** And here's how we did it.

So I knew what car I wanted, and I had a price quote and everything (~$19,000). However, that was just at that one Nissan dealership. Dealerships vary, both in salespeople and management. What one Nissan dealer offers may be better than another Nissan dealer offers. So knowing this, I called a different Nissan dealership across town and asked to speak to the sales manager (or whoever is in charge of the salespeople, I forget their exact title). Here's how the conversation more or less went:

Manager: ""Hello?""  
Me: ""Yes, I'm from out of town visiting for just a few days and was in the market for a new car. I know exactly which make/model I want and which features to go with it. If you have this car in stock, I can assure you that I will make my way over right now to buy it under one condition.""  
Manager: ""What's the condition?""  
Me: ""I will buy it if you waive the nonsense fees.""  
*Silence as the manager decides whether the sale will be worth it*  
Manager: ""Ok then, luckily we have that car in stock, so you got yourself a deal.""  
Me: ""Thank you, I'll be over soon.""  

So I have Nissan dealer A who I already test drove with and everything, and Nissan dealer B who has the same car but has already agreed to take off the nonsense fees. Only problem with dealer B is their car they have in stock may not be 100% what you were looking for (missing features, wrong color, etc.) while you already know what you're getting at dealer A. So I call dealer A with a proposal:  

Salesman: ""Hello?""  
Me: ""Yes, this is so-and-so from earlier about the 2014 Sentra. I'll buy it if you waive the nonsense fees.""  
Salesman: ""You got yourself a deal.""  

Luckily for me, he was already willing to agree to something like that, but **if he didn't, I would've said that the other Nissan dealer would waive the fees, and I'd take my business to dealer B if dealer A didn't waive the fees.** The only thing a salesman hates more than losing a sale is losing a sale to another official dealer in the same area, especially if it was for the same car. This brought the overall price of the car down to about $18,000.  

Within the hour, me and my dad are back at the dealer, ready to proceed with the final part of the sale...

**Part 3: Negotiating the Money**
==========================  

My dad tells me there's two ways dealers can make money: from the car and from the loan. If a dealer sacrifices profits on the car, they're going to try to make up for it in the loan with interest rates, and vice versa. So keep this in mind: just because you managed to lower the sticker price of the car, doesn't mean negotiations are over. You still have to agree on the interest rate.  

Me being a 22yo with good credit (~700) and no cosigner on the car and no down payment, I was given about a 5% interest rate over 60 months. Again, if it was just me, I'd sign right then and there because after that whole day, I just wanted to take the keys and drive off. But my dad had one more trick up his sleeve, which wasn't even a trick. Out of nowhere he says:  

""If you bring the interest rate down to 3%, there will be no question we'll buy this car. But if you don't, we're walking out.""  

Here we are, seconds away from signing papers, and he throws this curveball at them. You have to imagine they're thinking we're bluffing but **here's where the importance of the poker face comes in**. I didn't show too much eagerness. My face backed up his words: lower the rate or we're out. And they knew the car mine, not his, so I was the one they would need to convince, not him.  

Nonetheless, it worked. I walked out of that dealership owning a 2014 Nissan Sentra fresh off the truck for ~$18,000 at a 3% interest rate over 60 months, with no penalty if I pay it off early (my salary has increased to $80k since).   

I'm not sure if I could do it all over again by myself, but I'm thankful I had my dad to help me out, who's been in the business since the '70s.  

**tl;dr: Poker faces help with negotiations. And if you're a graduating college student, look for college discounts on dealer websites.**",finance,1412149630

I'm conflicted and not sure what to do.  The $1300 credit line is going to be paid off within the next month and a half due to high interest rates but I'm not sure about the other credit lines.  I'm making more than the minimum payments but I'm not sure how any of this is going to affect me financially in the future with credit scores and what not.

stocks,What do you guys think about gold at these prices? Considering position,"Title says it all. Please do not just downvote because this isn't a TSLA conversation. Gold is much unloved on reddit but it is hitting some strong technical resistance in a world where much could go wrong. 

Gold seems to be hitting off of resistance right above $1,200/oz. The stock market also broke through some key resistance, and this current correction might be more than a dip. Gold seems to move up when the market moves down, making it seem like a great hedge, for now.

At the same time, I am worried about this downtrend continuing. I do think that it could drop as low as $1,000/oz if it breaks through $1,200 on strong volume. $1,000 has been a ultra key resistance level for gold &amp; is a very round number regardless (provides psychological resistance). The fed's dovish policies are also helping boost AU. Obviously those could end at any time, though this might also send stocks tumbling.

Also, what do you think about entering NUGT here? NUGT is a 3x gold miner fund that follows the price of gold very closely (I am aware of leverage decay). It is around its all time lows.

energy,Solar Panels- Are They Worth The Cost?,"Are solar panels worth it?  A $5 billion Solar City’s investment raises the question of how much it costs the average homeowner in western New York to install a set of solar panels at home. First of all solar panels may not be for everyone because there are some requirements for having them installed. You either have to have land to put the panels on or a roof that is capable of handling their size and weight.

Yes, going solar is a beneficiary to the environment since it’s the act of producing electricity through the rays of the sun, but does that make it a good choice for you? 

The most important reason why people switch to solar is for the inevitable ability to save money, but you may wonder how it does.

The fledgling solar industry deals both with the residential and commercial markets. Due to the initial cost of installing a solar power system – the solar panels, wiring, and electronic controls – the commercial market is the leader now, but the residential market seems to be slowly catching up.

Diane Piegza, Vice President of Corporate Communications for Uncle Bob’s, said the company is installing solar panels at 15 of its New York properties, and 30 in other states. “The incentives do play a role at this point in time, as far as the installation, but the savings that we are seeing on the back side have been tremendous,” Piegza said.
Residential solar electric systems on average, cost about $20,000, but Dave Stapleton, President of David Homes, said in western New York, state and federal subsidies cover about half the cost, bringing it down to about $10,000 in out-of-pocket costs.
“Right now, it’s about the consumer making a choice. Do you spend a little bit more on granite counter tops or something else as a finish on your home? Or do you spend it on something that is really going to pay for itself in the long run?” Stapleton said.
For example, being set at 0.06 cents per KWH when in off-peak hours and then between peak times like 2-7 in the afternoon that rate can jump between 0.06 to 0.50 cents per KWH. To save as much electricity as possible you don't want to run any major appliances if anything at all during peak hours otherwise it can raise your bill drastically.

When it all comes down to whether or not solar panels are worth the expense you need to do the research on your own. . Figure out where you would be able to have them installed, if there is going to be any trees or other things blocking the panels in the area of question.",energy,1412183240

personalfinance,What have I done?,"Ok PF, I need some advice of what or what not to do. Backstory:I'm 25. A few months ago I read all about the oil boom occurring in North Dakota. I read about people with little or no prior experience working on wells making 70+K a year, truck drivers 100+K. I wanted to get in on that. I was living in New York as a semi-NEET working at FedEx as a package handler,literally living in my mothers basement. My mother died on Easter this year and she left basically everything to my sister except a salary from her state job. In August I received a 65K inheritance. I saw this as a terrific chance to try and work in ND because I had nothing really in NY, just NEETdom and minimum wage jobs while living under my sister's house. Since I had read that housing was tough to come by I looked around and purchased a small camper which I could take out and stay in while I worked. $2000 (First mistake?) I traded my HHR in to the guy I bought the camper from for a 2001 ford expedition and paid $3000 (second mistake?) After this I bought some stuff that I thought I would need out there. Another $5000 total. (third mistake?) 
I left NY for ND last Wednesday and it was going very well until my Explorer just stopped working outside of Michigan City Indiana. Apparently the whole drive from NY to IN I was drive with 4WD on, which totally destroyed the engine and transmission. (Fourth mistake)I had to get it and the camper towed and have been staying at a local motel since Friday completely stranded. They said it was more expensive to get repairs then buy a new truck. I have been looking at local used dealers and found another Ford Explored yesterday for $6000. Since I am stranded and the towing place said they will only keep my camper for a week I have to either buy it or junk everything and sulk back home. The problem being that the dealer wont accept debit or credit card which is all I have on me, and western union wont wire from my bank. The only option they said is to give my bank the dealers account information and take it out from mine into theirs. (if they can even do that-my bank said they might not!)

My question is this - should I go ahead and get this other ford explorer (if I can that is) and continue on to North Dakota where there are more jobs and better paying? or should I sulk back home and accept I wasted almost $20,000 of my limited inheritance. What else could I have done, and what else can I do to escape NEETdom and living as a loser with my sister? I'm sitting in this motel in Indiana constantly haunted by all this.

personalfinance,Went motorcycle shopping for quotes and I was rejected for financing by dealer's loaner. Seeking advice.,"Hello. I was curious about what my options with the dealer were for financing a new motorcycle purchase. 

Before doing so, I checked my credit by getting 3 free reports (from some website I can't remember now). I didn't see any problems with my history and I had an excellent credit score.

The listed price of the bike (CBR500R ABS) was $6,799.00. With taxes and fees they said I'd be looking at a final price of around $8000 at best. I'm pretty ignorant to automobile purchasing so this caught me by surprise. Doing a little searching on reddit's history with MSRP and final pricing the general consensus seemed to be that it is normal to pay $1000 to $2000 more than the MSRP on motorcycles. 

The salesman did his thing and spoke with his manager. After about 20 minutes he comes back and says that I couldn't get a deal for the bike I wanted because there was an issue with my credit (more on this a little later). 

The salesmen then went on to try to sell me another bike listed at a special discounted price of ~$6400.00 which I apparently was approved for. I wasn't too interested though and online reviews tended to describe it as not a bad bike, but a substandard one considering performance of similarly priced bikes. The prices were only $300 apart so I'm not sure why I was approved for one but not the other. 

I was concerned about my credit so the manager came out and explained that I have good credit, but there was another issue. The way it was explained to me was that the credit limits on my credit cards were relatively low and didn't demonstrate reliability or security for the currently requested loan amount which was larger. This made sense to me at first. He suggested I contact my credit card issuers and request an increase in my credit limits again before applying for another loan with them (or anyone else). 

I've already successfully increased my main credit card limit to $7000 (it was previously $4600). All my other cards I never really use. I got them to get special, interest free financing for different stuff a long time ago and one of them was closed (which I don't even remember having). The card that I didn't remember having had a credit limit of $27,800. This account was closed several years ago. I have another card with a credit limit of $13,500. These last two cards might be a shared account that I have with my parents though so maybe that is why they weren't considered for the loan I tried to apply for today. 

So I recently got a job with an employer who says they pay for my taxes. Does this mean that if I get paid $300 a month I will receive $300 a month? I'm finding this kind of hard to believe because I've never heard of something like this before. At any rate assuming this is true, under absolutely and highly unlikely circumstances I would make $300/month. In reality though, I will probably make at least $600/month. I also have another job which likely won’t provide me much work. I can probably expect to make another $100 a month from this job.

I currently have about $1000 (give or take a couple of hundred). Two months from now I could have a little under $2000. 

I recently heard about penfed and checked out their rates. I could borrow $6000 at 5.79% APR on a 48 month term IF I qualify. The monthly payments would be $140.33 which I can handle. Now I tried to see if I would qualify, but I have to create an account with them and become a member. To become a member I must make a one time $15 donation to some organization which I have no problem doing unless afterwards I find out I don't qualify for the loan.

Does anyone have any experience with penfed? Given my credit situation (which is moderately good) would I likely qualify? I like to avoid borrowing large amounts money (to me $6000 is already a lot), but would borrowing $8000 be good for my credit history? If so, is it a worth-while thing to do?

personalfinance,"Use 401k or $1,000 emergency fund to pay down high interest credit cards?","My girlfriend was recently laid off, but quickly found another job. Same pay rate, but she now has to pay half of her medical insurance, which reduces her monthly income by almost $400 per month. This is putting her in a very tight situation, so we've went to work trying to free up as much cash flow as possible. Even if we're able to free up an extra $200 per month to put toward the CC's, it'll take years for her to pay them off. 

For whatever reason, she was saving money, rather than paying off her CC's. In the past month we've paid off three of her low balance CC's with the savings, freeing up around $125 per month.

We left $1,000 in her savings as an emergency fund. She has three balance carrying cards left, CC1 - $1544 of $2500 @ 24.2% - $49 MP, CC2 - $1397.55 @ 18.9% - $38 MP, and CC3 - $979.30 @ 9.9% - $25 MP. 

In her particular case (I help quite a few people with personal finance), I'm thinking it might be better to pay down CC1 with that $1000 savings. I've heard of people using a CC as their emergency fund before, and while I generally wouldn't advise it, cash flow is the top priority right now. The other option is to cash in a portion of her 401k, take the hit, and pay off all the cards. Another so-so option, but there's no way she's going to see returns that surpass those interest rates. 

Final notes: She hasn't used a CC in two months, and I have every reason to believe this will continue. She also isn't one of those people who seem to be prone to 'having emergencies' due to other life choices.  

**10/3 Edit:** Thank you for the replies, guys. The very first thing we did, a couple months back, was try to get a 0% balance transfer card. Unfortunately, it was declined. Research after the fact revealed it was actually a fairly tough card to get, though she got a 'pre-qualification' letter in the mail. Next time we'll do our research before taking the CR hit.  

We went ahead and proceeded with the first option. I'm happy to report, she just received her first check, which was $200 more than our forecast (always forecast conservatively!). This, combined with our cost cutting, should give her enough cash to pay off the entire balance of the 24% card next month. According to said forecast, it looks like she may actually be debt free by January 1. 

I also want to thank you for educating me about the 401k loan, I didn't know that was an option. Luckily, she won't be needing it.",finance,1412196530

i took some macroeconomics courses so i have only some basic knowledge. Why is it an advantage, that the money supply is fix? The federal reserve (don't know how it works in the US, im from germany) could just decide to not print any USD anymore. But they don't do it, because monetary policy is an important tool to stimulate the economy.


Let's say there is an external shock, that drops the Investements of the people. With a variable money supply the federal reserve can print money, which increases the money supply which leads to money supply&gt;money demand. This makes money ""cheaper"" and increases the investments, because the interestrate drops. So people have an incentive to take a loan and ""invest it"".

This is really basic stuff that we learned and i don't understand why it wouldn't be important, because bitcoin is a currency, right?

I am 29 single male. I do not really have any experience with managing my finances. My mom has always taught me to be frugal, save the money in a bank, and stay away from the stock market. Due to 6 years in the military and living with my mom working for the family business I've had very low to no expenses my whole life. To be honest, I do not really understand the value of money. I've always had everything I ever needed and I have few desires. Money is something I never really put much thought into. Now that I have some money in the bank I don't know what to do with it. 

**Here is my situation.**

$15k in a savings account.

$300 in checking

$19k in a Roth IRA (CD) account that was started by my parents when I was born. The last statement says the interest rate is .07% which i'm guessing i'm losing money to inflation and it needs to be pulled out and put into something new.

$85K, loaned money to the family business a few years ago. I will be getting this paid back next year.

$10k invested in bitcoins a little over a year ago. I know /r/pf probably disagrees with this as an investment but it is something i truly believe in. I have about 24 btc currently worth $9192.

When the family business sells I will be getting %20. This could be anywhere from $320k-$400k 

**Monthly Income**
$2k a month working 3-4 days for the family business + one weekend a month in the reserves.

$2k poker winnings for 35 hours worth of playing for the month of September. I plan on playing 30-40 hours a week, 2-3 weeks a month. My hourly rate will be anywhere from $25 to $50. Is this considered a 2nd job? Do i need to pay taxes if i still consider this a hobby? I will be driving 2 hours to the poker room and sleeping in my van at nights.

**Expenses**

Car insurance $100 a month. It will be going into storage during the winter so it will drop down to low $20s.
$200 on gas a month (poker travel).
$100 food when I am on the road.
$30 gym fee

**Other things to consider**.
Banking with USAA.
Car is paid off. 
Free medical through the VA. 
I might be eligible for more VA benefits in a year(small pay check).
College if i choose to go will be paid for through the GI bill.
My job in the military is repairing medical equipment. I feel like this will be my best option once the family business sells. I would be willing to move anywhere in the states.

We do not plan on selling the family business for a few more years. What should I do with the money I saved? I know I need to do something with my Roth IRA which isn't making any money but I have no idea where to start. How can I make my money work for me?

I draw more than model, and so I feel visual development and storytelling is where I want to direct myself. But at this point I have put myself in a very VERY deep hole.

My parents thought they made too much money for me to get federal aid for college, so I received my Bachelor's of Science in Media Arts &amp; Animation from the Art Institute on mostly private loans.

I DO want to be a great artist, and I love the processes and learning it, but I feel school may not be the way to go. I am also planning to move states with my boyfriend in 8 months, as I do NOT want to be stuck in the city I am in.

I would feel a failure to drop out of school, especially halfway through when the next step is a thesis project on which I can choose, and if I decide to stay I am thinking of switching majors from 3D Modeling to Visual Development, where I believe I'll find the love of the process again. But continuing school is just prolonging a storm of payments, and I have become so stressed and depressed about the process of art I have lost a lot of my love for it. But if I drop out, the payments may be too much to carry right now, especially wanting to move states.

I do agree that Visual Development artists are not as demanded as 3d modelers, as there are plenty of other industries I could use those skills in. So if I do continue school, I agree I should suck it up and keep on my 3D track. But SHOULD I continue school? I know the debt would be insurmountable, but isn't it already? And if I were to drop out now, there is NO WAY I can make payments, especially trying to move to a new city where I have a better chance at finding a job in my field. I can't move for another 8 months because my boyfriend is finishing school, and if I drop out now that window to move closes. I am going to contact my lawyer to see if there are other options, or maybe go the Undue Hardship route, because there is no way I would be able to make $5,000 monthly payments for over 10 years unless I made a ton of money, which would take me a while to climb that ladder to do. I spent the last 4 years being an Imaging Artist and Assistant Product Development Manager for Cashman Enterprises, working on pre-visualization and graphic design. I know I can get work again, just have to find out how. I feel horrible I put myself in this position, but in a way I don't regret it. I can only move forward, so please, no more sad-sack comments or hurtful prods. I am asking for honest help. Thank you unrulyhyena and alliedeluxe, I will look into both of these routes.

personalfinance,Considering getting another credit card,"My freshman year of college I opened a credit card with Citi and after four years I have a credit limit of $4200 with 1% cash back and 17% APR and no annual fee (not sure if there are other numbers I should be aware of). I had no trouble keeping my credit utilization at the optimal 30% or so during college, never carrying a balance, and hence my credit score is in the low 700s.

Since then, I've graduated college and moved to San Francisco where I make $90,000 in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. Simply put, I'm beginning to feel a little stifled with the current amount of credit, with my utilization reaching 80% or higher in recent months.

I'm thinking that my credit score and salary ought to allow me to get something better than what I was able to get a student. However, I'm unsure what to be looking for in a new credit card... Conventional wisdom seems to warn against annual fees and high interest rates, but then past that I'm not sure what to go with and it seems like all the websites that recommend cards tend to be sponsored by the companies they recommend.

Maybe I should just request a line increase on my current card? I could use some guidance in this area. Hope I've provided enough information",finance,1412231092

personalfinance,Which path to take? Full-time job &amp; graduate school,"Hello PF,

I've been stabilizing my family's finances ever since I graduated from college and got a decent paying job. Many thanks to PF for tips and advice, thus piquing my desire to learn more and maximize my potential for savings and cutting costs in the long run.

I am nearing the time when I'll be starting graduate school to pursue my Master's this coming January and I have a few options to take and would like advice on what makes sense.

Some background information first:

 * Got my BS with 12 credits worth of graduate courses I can transfer to my University's BS/MS program - Non-thesis option requires 30 credits worth of graduate courses to complete
 * Have about $20,000 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans ranging from 3.4% (majority) to 6.8% (only $2200).
 * I gross $52,000 annually contributing 6% to maximize employer contribution
 * I give my mother $1,400 per month to help pay for housing expenses (essentially rent?) - I live at home for now
 * Before taking the job, I was already accepted into the graduate program and am eligible for $20,500 in Direct Unsubsidized loans at 3.86% for the academic year

Tricky situation here though. I took the job offer and expecting not to go back to school this Fall, I withdrew and declined my loans. My employer is encouraging me to go back and they will reimburse tuition and fees costs by 50% per semester, up to $5,000 per year. I called my University and they deferred my application so I am technically a graduate student now waiting to register for the Spring semester. I can still access my loans since the FAFSA was submitted prior to my job.

[Here's a spreadsheet of 4 scenarios I can take.](http://i.imgur.com/3CR9rD3.png)

**Scenario 1:**  
Go part-time (6 credits) while working for Spring 2015 (take out loans), Summer 2015 (to be able to access my offered Fall 2014 loans, according to my University's financial aid office), Fall 2015 (no loans because not expecting to receive any aid due to new FAFSA).

**Scenario 2:**  
Go part-time while working for Spring 2015, Fall 2015, and Spring 2016 to receive more employer benefits. But I need to pay out of pocket or save much of the loans dispersed to use for the next semesters.

**Scenario 3:**  
Go full-time student status while working for Spring 2015 (more loans offered because the original eligibility was $10,500 per semester) and Fall 2015 (pay out-of-pocket). This will let me graduate with my MS in one year.

**Scenario 4:**  
Go full-time student status while working for Spring 2015, part-time for Summer 2015 (to be able to access my offered Fall 2014 loans), and part-time for Fall 2015. I can still graduate in 1 year but more work upfront, especially in the summer.

I am leaning more towards Scenario 2 for workload-related reasons. I don't mind needing to pay some out of pocket to be able to do that though. However, with my loans being 3.86%, would it be feasible to take those because it is a decently low rate? I could definitely use my income now to help pay down my mom's debt (only $5,500 to go) and pay the bills, but we're in no means unable to sustain ourselves if I didn't help.

And as you can see from the notes I jotted down from speaking with my University's financial aid office and myfedloans.org, I have taken advantage of forbearance and half-time school deferment so I won't receive mandatory bills to repay my loans. This money would be used to pay down any high debt (10%+ APY), and other bills instead. I'm not worried about my student loans accumulating interest in the long run because of my potential for a decent paying job.

personalfinance,401k vs Student loans,"Hey guys, need some help here. Just moved to NYC and took a job paying 115K with annual bonus of around 25% (paid in 2016 since I just started). The company is pretty stable, with great growth potential. Benefits are good with 50% match on 401k up to 100% of my contributions. Funds are solid (Wells Fargo).
I also have 2 student loans:
1 private loan, 43K outstanding, 5.4% LIBOR
1 federal loan, 19K outstanding, 3.5% fixed

The bump in salary allows me to put an extra 1K a month towards the loans, but it doesn't leave a lot for retirement contributions. I should probably max out the 401k, but the temptation to pay off the private loan within the next 18 months or so is strong (especially with the variable rate).

personalfinance,"Questions about balancing healthcare expenses versus mandatory expenses, forcing myself to follow a budget, and soon going to college.","Sorry in advance for so much text.

I'm a 32 year old going back to college beginning in January to finish a bachelor's degree. (BA Geography with GIS focus, then hopefully a Masters--either in Hydrology, Hydrogeography or Medical Geography.) this will take me an estimated 3 years for the bachelors. 

I have a job that pays well and I'll be working that during summers to help keep costs down during college. I am going to have a career change, this is non-negotiable, necessary for myself, and I prefer not not have suggestions or questions (Why not just try another position in the field you're in? Why don't you like it? Why not stay where you are in a good-paying job? Why not [etc ad infinitum]??) It's necessary for myself, my psychiatrist and psychologist agree, and really I would soonest not get into it here. 

A complicating factor is my health. Raised without health insurance in a rural area (no doctor visits, no immunizations, no fluoride in the well water, no mental health treatment, etc), and a recent benefitter from ObamaCare, I'm playing serious catchup with my health. 

The numbers scare me, honestly, and it seems so impossible to balance all of this. I'm spacing out dental care as I can afford it... I'm not getting all cares I need. There's stuff I'm putting off. The numbers for healthcare and education are below and I don't really know how to come up with a budget. 

I've written these numbers out on paper so many times. Then I just feel overwhelmed and it seems hopeless. $8000 spent on healthcare and dentist so far this year alone, including $1900 last month. 

Needed medical cares: 
1. $2800 for severe TMJ treatment, plus unknown amount for concurrent three months of jaw-related physical therapy. Possibly $1000, possibly less or more. 

2. Counseling for mental health: $160 per month (one visit per week at $40 copay), ideally. I've been spacing these visits out to save money. These visits will need to continue for the foreseeable future.

3. Further dental work at an estimated $4000. The most urgent is $1500; a root canal is needed and a tooth is in danger of breaking. I've finally found a dentist I trust, who keeps me out of pain during the procedure, sooo I'm not gonna go to another one to save money. 

4. Tooth implant, $2500. This can be postponed for a year or more.

5. Physical therapy for other medical issues I'd soonest not go into on reddit, unknown cost. I am currently postponing this. So instead I'm taking pain meds which help with the pain. 

6. Glasses, eye exam yearly (prescription changes yearly, my eyes are partially crossed so I'm going to a specialist for both exam and glasses)... This year the exam was $330, and the glasses $365. These glasses look damn good on me, which is nice.

7. I'd like to get contacts sometime. $65 training for then, then other cost unknown. This is not a necessity...so I'm postponing this too. 

College expenses, begins in January:

1. College insurance $2200 with a $500 deductible. This deductible will definitely be met so I'm looking at $2700 for a year of health insurance. Copays and medication payments will be additional to this.

2. College tuition is $4000/semester. I hopefully will be awarded a scholarship which I qualify for at $1000/semester. As long as I keep my grades up, I keep the scholarship. So tuition $3000/semester (hopefully). Classes begin in January. I understand books and some fees are extra, I do not know how much this will cost. 

Ok so that's the expenses that will be coming and that need done. 

Monthly income averages about $4000, depending on how many hours I can get. It can be less by up to $1000. 

In January, I'll start school full time and monthly income will drop to about $2000/month. 

Monthly mandatory budget:
Rent $620, all utilities included

Student loans $250, minimum. I usually pay $50-100 more. 

Phone $99 (unlimited grandfathered plan with decent reception, I used 15gig last month. Used a *lot* for my job; directions, email, online research, calls. Other cheaper unlimited plans don't have coverage here so I'm planning on staying on this plan unless something similar can be pointed out.)

Car insurance $90

Dental insurance $32 (gets me some savings at dentist)

Health insurance $370 (this will change in January when I get student health insurance)

Car payment $200 (I often pay $50 extra)

I don't have internet at my place, I go to library for this. I don't have a TV or Netflix. I'm trying to save money. 

More flexible monthly expenses: 

Gas $200

Hotel $280 (I commute to a job 80 miles away. Stay at hotel overnight. $70/night. I stayed at a cheaper hotel and got bedbugs. I'm sure I could save money somehow here, but putting more miles on my car is not an option. There is a reward program for free hotel nights, I'm in it. Had about 10 free stays so far.)

Food/groceries/soap/toothpaste/etc $350

Meds $80-120 (They're trying to figure out best ""happy med"" combo for me, so it varies.)

$200--seriously something always comes up. Professional license renewal and oil change last month plus unauthorized credit card withdrawal that I'm fighting.)

Eating out $50

Counseling $160

Psychiatrist $40


And the thing I'm not proud of. I like nice things. I feel I deserve them by working long hours at stressful jobs. These things make me feel happy. And last month alone I spent $300 on things I like (for instance: Build-a-bear stuffed Toothless dragon, new ear piercing, gemstone for custom necklace, craft supplies, gift for a sibling, and so on). It's a cycle: First I forbid myself to buy anything not strictly necessary. I succeed for a week or two. Then I feel sad that I'm not treating myself. So I treat myself. And it adds up, then I feel guilty, then I tell myself to not buy anything unnecessary. Repeat. I feel there's a balance here somewhere and I don't know how to find it. 

For debts, I have $27000 in student loans, most at 6%. I have $5000 in car loan at 4.5%. My credit is bad and I'm working on fixing this. I have no other debt. 

So there are the numbers. I don't know how to make sense of this. I don't know how to afford the healthcare I need. I very much want to go to college and probably only need to take out student loans for this Spring semester--maybe I won't have to thanks to tax reimbursement. I'm hoping to work hard during summers and save enough for tuition. I'm afraid to put it off longer; I'm 32 already and have kept trying and quitting to get a bachelors. I just need to finish it. 

Ummmm...I hope this mind dump makes sense. I don't know what to do or how to do it.

personalfinance,"My 401k doesn't seem good, which funds to pick?","I am 27 and Married. My income is ~82k, my wife's (26) is 20k (Grad Student with 4-5 years left). 

My company matches 50% of my contributions upto a maximum of 4% (my contribution). So I will be paying in just enough to get the max company match ~($4900 total including match), after that I need liquid assets as we will need to replace my wife's car soon and that will deplete the emergency liquid fund. Only once I have replenished that will I be able to correct the ratios of my retirement savings with an IRA.

For the 401k I want 10-15% bonds and a 70/30 domestic/international split on the remaining stocks.

The trouble is the expense ratios are high, and several of the funds have sales charges.

For Bonds the reasonable choices I have seem to be between Fidelity Advisor Inflation Protected Bond Fund (T) - FIPTX - 0.80 Net ER but with a 4.00% Maximum Sales Charge or the BlackRock Total Return Fund (R) - MRCBX with 1.10 Net ER. I'm inclined towards the BlackRock as there are no fees.

For Stocks I really don't know though, I have two choices that are below 1% but these don't give me the required ratio of domestic to international. They are BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund(I) -MAFGX - 0.83 % Net ER and American Funds Growth Fund of America	RGACX - 0.98 % Net ER. Every other fund has 1.10 or higher (mostly higher Net ER). So should I even consider the other funds to improve the rations of domestic/internat. or should I wait to get an IRA to correct these ratios.

personalfinance,"Save for Nothing, because Something Will Happen","I've spent nearly all of this year putting money away in my savings.  According to my finance document, I was on track to have $17k+ by tax time next year, with a ""whopping"" $1000 / mo+ in savings over the year.

I did forget some things, though, and am now on track for $0 or *less* come tax time.

---

* **W2 ""Cheating"".  $8000.**  Just remembered last month that I claim more exemptions than I can actually file come tax time next year.  I've been doing this for two years to ""get ahead"" because we were dirt poor before this and couldn't handle the initial expenses of car, furniture, apartment, etc. without doing so.  My assumption is that a raise will help offset tax time.  That's not guaranteed, though, and I didn't plan for it properly in my budget until recently.

* **Second Car.  $3000.**  We get by on one car right now, but that won't cut it when mommy finishes school and starts working.  I already have the reputation as the least reliable employee in my company because we drop each other (and the baby) off everywhere, all of the time, relatively inconsistently.  With our poor credit, the down payment, monthly payments, and insurance will hit us hard.

* **Broken heart.  $6000.**  Fiance and I broke up.  To keep each other out of court and come to an agreement, I currently pay $1000 / mo in child support.  She is an amazing woman and I usually see where the money goes, but that doesn't change the current financial situation.

* **Trashed apartment.  $500.** Fiance and I broke up.  She trashed my apartment.  The only place I found that would clean the carpet, furniture, deal with broken glass, rotten food, etc. the very next day charged me $500 for the job.  (I literally had no where to sleep, so this was a desperate, poorly planned expense.)

---

Not to mention that before I started doing the math, I was rocked earlier this year by:

* **Vehicle problems.  $1500.**  The good old '03 car decided its front springs were now complete crap and required a full rack replacement.  Dished out a couple thousand dollars for that, other repairs, and maintenance.

---

These were all unknown unknowns.  Things I had entirely not considered.  I thought I was saving just for the heck of it.  I stashed away some money for the inevitable car troubles, but could not have predicted all of the other expenses that have come up.

So the next time someone asks you, ""Why are you saving that much money?"" remind them that you know this one guy who ""cheats"" on his taxes, ""needs"" a second car, ""tore up"" his first car, and got his apartment trashed (no quotes, this was literal) by his ex-fiance, and his finances are effed the eff up.

If it can happen to me, it can happen to you.

personalfinance,My mom was fed up with Verizon and decided to pay off the debt they wouldn't clear.......,"Sorry it's kind of long, but my entire family is heated over the situation so here we go:

About 6 Months ago my iPhone 4s stopped charging so I took it into a Verizon store. They couldn't figure out the reason why and said send it in and they will give you another one. At the time I bought my phone, I had purchased the extended warranty ($140) as well and that was bought in a different state. After returning the phone (to the manufacturer) and getting a new one, there was a charge on our bill for the amount of a brand new iPhone 4s. Naturally, I called and explained the situation. They said that since I had purchased an extended warranty from an 'authorized retailer’, the warranty would only work at that location and Verizon would not honor it. I said fine send it back to me then I will figure something out. It was already in the warehouse processing, so the guys said that was not possible but said if I returned it within the month, I would be refunded the full amount and could go get a new phone (since we had an upgrade). I returned it, went and used my upgrade (to get 5c) and went on with my life.

Since then, at least twice a month for the past 6 or 7 months each of our phones (family plan) was texted and called about an outstanding balance that wouldn't clear, and each time we called in and they would say it was under control and wouldn't be on the next bill. Guess what, it was on the next bill!

Finally, we let the old man get on the phone thinking they will listen to him as he is a pretty intimidating guy. What happens? They hang up on him mid phone conversation and shut off our phones. After calling back in again and getting them turned on (for a $60 fee, which they didn’t tell us about), they said we were good and all should be square with our pending charges.

5 day's ago, all of our phones were shut off randomly with no warning at all for a 'bill' that was outstanding and never paid. My Mother finally said fuck it and paid it off so our phones can be turned back on, costing another turn on fee ($60) and total 'extra charges' coming to around $600.

So as of now, they are charging us for a phone that was returned and made us pay for each time the phones had to be turned back on.

Naturally we are going to be switching services as I honestly would rather deal with Comcast than Verizon at this point.

My questions:
Is there anything we can do to get this money back or any tips for a next point of action? They had said ‘Upper Management’ would give us a call but of course that never happened.

What is a quality phone provider to switch over to as we have been Verizon customers for almost 15 years now (without a late bill I may add)?

Thanks for listening to my rant Reddit just very, very frustrated by the whole situation as I've never been treated so poorly by a company in my entire life.

TL;DR - Verizon Strong armed us into paying fee's that we shouldn't of had to pay and Mother decided to just pay it off so we would stopped being harassed and could switch services.",finance,1412280659

personalfinance,"Buying a house, should I put a higher down payment or do a 95% LTV and invest the rest?","We are in the process of buying a house and selling ours. Both houses are already under contract. After commissions I expect about 70k from the proceeds of our house..

Here's my dilemma: Should I use the majority of the proceeds towards the downpayment of the new home, or would it be a better idea to do a 95% LTV loan (12k down) and invest the rest in a Roth IRA (5k) + I Bonds (10k) + liquid cash savings (~43k) to be added to Roth IRA each year. 

 High credit scores, No car debt; no credit card debt. Early 30s, about 85k in our combined retirement accounts, but we don't have an emergency fund nor Roth IRA and only contribute ~8k/yr to 401k. a 95% LTV loan would be about 1.5x our gross annual income.

I consider myself a pretty frugal guy, and part of me thinks that mathematically investing is a better idea. But I really dislike debt and I get shivers thinking about hundreds of thousands of interest that a 30yr loan has (Our current mortgage is a 15yr).

Edit: Purchase price is 233k. I currently have an interest rate lock of 4.125%,  with 0 origination points and 0 discount points. At 95% Estimated loan amount is 221k, with closing costs of 4.7k and prepaid items of 3.9k. Cash from borrower shows 20k. No PMI Funding Fee",finance,1412285244

personalfinance,Pay off Auto loan or keep making payments?,"I have an auto loan with 2 years left and 4328.00 left at 10%.   Yes I know my interest rate is high, but my credit really sucked (525) when I got the loan.  I am currently up to 680 credit score according to CreditKarma.com.   

My question to you is do I continue making payments or do I pay it off in full today?   I like the credit ++'s but I hate the 10%?  I think it is financially more responsible to pay it off, but I want to hear suggestions.  So please, Personal Finance, give me the guidance I need!

Edit:  I took your guys advice and paid it off.  I had the money in savings to pay off the car + a good chunk.  I wanted to use it to build good credit, but after paying 700 bucks in interest last year alone, it was time for it to go.  Thank you for the advice.",finance,1412287251
personalfinance,Dealing with an old 401K + misc questions,"I'm in my late 30's and new to this investing stuff. I have a new job now which does not offer me a 401k. I had been doing the old job at a university for 9 years and its 403b balance on the TIA-cref website is around $60,000.

I have around $15K cash and I have read this reddit wiki page ([""I have $X, what should I do with it?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)).
I had read about a Roth IRA before and according to the reddit wiki page, I was ready to start contributing to an IRA. So yesterday I created a Roth IRA account at Vanguard and I sent them a check for $5,500. The customer service guy asked me about the old retirement plan and said I should roll it over to an IRA for a better return. I told him I would do further investigation before doing that so here I am. The asset classes for that old plan say: 46% Guaranteed (fixed interest rate of 3 percent), Equities 35%, real estate 10%, fixed income 9%. Looking at a graph the average 'personal rate of return' for each quarter is around 2 to 3% for the last 2 years. My first and main question is:

- I talked to customer service at TIA-cref. They have an expense ratio of around 0.5%. They said the taxes have not been taken out of the money so I can only move it to a traditional IRA. According to her if I did moved it into a Roth IRA, I would get a 10% penalty for early withdrawal. A fixed 20% federal tax will be applied when I am retired and I start using the money. So what should I with the old plan? I could move it into a Vanguard account. They have some [information](https://investor.vanguard.com/401k-rollover/options) on this but I dont know what to do. Anything else I should do or know about?

I had a few other questions (in order of importance): 

1. After keeping 6 months of expenses ($6,600) in the checking account as directed by the reddit [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) page and sending $5,500 to Vanguard for the Roth IRA, I have around $4,000 left. I will be also saving $300-800 extra every month. What should I do with these monthly savings? The customer service person said I should put it into another account with their company but I dont know what kind of account to use for that.
2. I wanted to know if I'm doing enough for retirement. According to Mint.com's approximations, I need to save at least $3,500/month if I want a $55K/year income at the retirement age of 65. I make a total of $2,500/month in cash and can currently save only around $300-800/month. Therefore the $3,500 saving/month is a concern and maybe its high because I started saving late or maybe the calculator is [wrong?](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1a37yu/mint_told_me_i_need_to_save_almost_4kmo_for_my/) According to another [website](http://money.msn.com/retirement/retirement-calculator.aspx), I only need to save an extra $320/month. Vanguard says I need to save $1,500/month. The numbers for these calculators are: current age is 38. Retire at 65. Current retirement balance is $60,000 and it has not been taxed and will be taxed at a fixed 20% in the end. Current earning is $40K/year, or $2,500 cash/month. Desired retirement income is $50/year or any other average number. I've read that Social security may or may not be available so I'm not including that. Not sure what to make of these numbers or what I can do about it?
3. If I get another job with matching 401K, I will start contributing max to it, then complete the $5,500 limit for the IRA every year and then if I have money left over, I keep sending the left over money to the same place discussed in point #1. Correct? 
4. At this point the details of what else I should do (e.g. 'Asset Allocation') are too complex for me. If I want to get good and genuine paid advice, where can I get it?
5. I have $550 in Scott Trade and I thought I would do that to play with stocks. I'm assuming doing the stock market is pretty difficult. Or if its the best option as far as profits are concerned, any pointers or recommended links on how to learn that stuff and make money?

These investment topics are hard to understand. I respect you guys for being smart enough to understand and know all this stuff. It seems like a different language to me. I'm trying my best to understand it. Thanks all!",finance,1412288345

My name is /u/Burrson and i've lurked here since you became a default sub. Recently I have received an offer in the mail from chase offering a balance transfer. 



I would be looking at moving 3 different accounts onto this card with a credit debt totaling 3046.89. I already have a balance on my chase card of 2,953.11 at a 22.24% interest rate. The offer is 0% interest until November 2015 and I hope to be able to pay it off until then. 

The other three cards I have hold lower interest rates, and I am wanting to use the avalanche method but I'm not sure if switching these lower interest cards to 0% will help considering they will get tacked on to the big nasty high interest card. 


What are your opinions?

personalfinance,"Landlord trying to keep deposit, charge extra fees, and more. Advice please.","Hey PF, 
Sorry - wall of text incoming.

So I had a lease with an apartment in a suburb of SLC, Utah from August 2013 to August 2014. The lease itself was highly weighted towards the apartment company, and early into my tenancy I found their reviews online were poor at best. They are known for numerous an exorbitant fees, including upon move-out.

The amount of money they are asking for isn't too much, but I feel they owe me money. Recently, I received a bill from them for about 40 bucks, but the way I figure it, they owe me about $85. 

I took video of the apartment shortly after move in and uploaded it to Youtube soon after move-in, and took another video on my last day there. I left the apartment in immaculate shape, it was totally clean from top to bottom with no paint damage. I recently replied to their request for more money. They are also charging a carpet shampoo fee which is I feel is fair enough, I reference that in my response to them.

""To whom it may concern,

This invoice I've been given is inaccurate. Two charges on this statement do not reflect the state I left the apartment in. 'Unit Cleaning Fee' and 'Touch Up Paint' are not appropriate. I cleaned the apartment top to bottom, and besides the carpet shampoo was move-in ready when I left it. As far as touching up the paint, this is also erroneous. I hung no pictures during my lease and made no damage to the walls. The paint work was mediocre at best upon move in. I video'ed the entire place upon move in and upon move out, I can show that the apartment was in the condition I claim if needed.

My records show that you owe me a balance of $84.95 remaining from the deposit. I expect a check to be mailed out by October 1, 2014, I would ask that I be notified when it is mailed. If you'd prefer, I can pick up the check instead.""

Their response is after a review of their pictures and records that the charges stand. I intend on sending a demand letter to them by email and registered mail very soon. 

Beyond that, I had many complaints about the apartment grounds and how they operated. I noted all this to them in my move-out notice they had 45 days in advance. I'll just summarize.

1. Dishonest advertising of pricing. There was no mention of additional fees like parking, renter's insurance, mandatory cable, rendering the advertised rate entirely inaccurate.
2. Broken gym equipment that was never repaired.
3. Crime. Car was broken into twice in that year. No security was ever provided for.
4. ""Renter's Insurance"" Didn't cover any of my belongings, only their property.
5. Homeless wandering the grounds and asking for money. 
6. Maintenance notifications that gave no appointment, just a window of time, up do a month, where they'd come in and do the mentioned maintenance. 
7. Shoddy paint work, drywall repair, poorly sealed shower fixtures. This was documented in my initial video.
8. Neighboring unit was having it's counters resurfaced, resulting in noxious fumes filling my apartment. 
9. Dog and bird feces everywhere. They had ducks and geese on the property. This one violates the 'default by owner' clause of the lease. They never made any attempt to hold residents with dogs accountable or clean up this stuff. The lease states in part on this point 'Owner agrees to act with diligence to: (a) keep common areas reasonably clean, (c) remain in substantial compliance with accepted federal, state, and local laws regarding safety and sanitation. 

So, I plan on a couple things at this point. I'm going to file a small claims to recover what they owe me along with court costs. I will leave a review along with the others on Google. And complain with the BBB. Beyond that, what else can I do? Can I attempt to recover any money for these additional complaints I have? Is there anything I can do to increase my chances in court?

This is not supposed to be trying to get a windfall, it's really more of a principle thing to me. I'm sure they're going to keep trying to do this, maybe I'll be enough of a thorn in their side to treat their residents a little better.

financial,Small Business Owners Get a Better Deal With Peer to Peer Lending,"As a small business owner, you probably know there is no such thing as a perfectly smooth product roll out. Combined with that, you are also sure to wind up with unexpected expenses, emergencies, and growth related restrictions that make it hard to avoid taking on business debt. If you are in a bottleneck or need capital for some other purpose, peer to peer lending offers far more advantages than conventional banks.

Business Credit Card Consolidation and Much More

Consider a situation where your business has enough of a credit rating to garner successful credit card applications. Unfortunately, keeping those credit cards up to date can be very difficult when upper management or others with expense accounts create more debt than expected.

These are just a few problems that can rob you of a chance to present a good credit picture when trying to secure bigger loans even years down the road. Don’t let this situation ruin you when short term, low interest peer to peer loans can get you out of debt fast and ensure you maintain a sterling credit rating.

Get Business Capital with Loans for People with Bad Credit at http://people-finance.com/get-funded-faster-easier-and-enjoy-better-rates-thru-peer-to-peer-lending/""

No matter how poor you may be great ideas and how to implement them can still come your way. Unfortunately, without capital, you will not be able to achieve any goal associated with starting a business. Even if your personal credit is bad, peer to peer lenders may still be willing to take a chance on your business ideas.

Here are some situations where a bank will turn you down, but a peer to peer lender will be more than willing to help you:

* Medical or credit card debt gives you a bad personal credit rating, but your business ideas are sound
* You have an innovative invention or something else that interests a viable number of consumers
* You have enough personal income to cover the loan even if your business efforts fail.

Low Interest Personal Loans to Start a Business With

Many business owners avoid peer to peer lenders because they believe the bank will offer lower interest rates. Surprisingly, banks often offer double or even triple higher interest rates than peer to peer lenders. Even if you aren’t cash strapped or still have a good enough credit rating for the bank, it is worth your while to work with peer to peer lenders instead.

If you are looking for a loan between 2,000 and 35,000, then peer to peer lenders can give you a better deal than conventional banks.

New and established business owners are sure to appreciate the speed of approval, lack of hassle, and better service associated with peer to peer lenders. Why should you let conventional banks ruin your chances for wealth and happiness when peer to peer lenders can help you and your business flourish?",finance,1412320729

I am 23 years old and have graduated with an undergraduate degree in May. Since the grace period for student loan repayment is coming to a close soon, I wanted to reach out to all of you to get some feedback on my plan of action that I've set for myself.

That being said, I would like some feedback on my current situation and if my plans to tackle any obligations is wise.

Income/savings information:

- Currently working in HR and make $25.96/hr. If my math is correct, that grosses me approximately $61,000 with OT included.
- Net check, paid biweekly: approximately $1,730. Health, vision, dental, life, etc. are all 100% covered by the employer.
- Wells Fargo: ~$2,100 in checking, $10,000 in savings as an emergency fund

Debt:

- Student loans: $32,924 with a mean interest rate of 4.9%. Here's the exact breakdown: http://imgur.com/QpGx9bZ

Monthly expenses:

- Rent, food, utilities: $0. My parents do not want me to move out until I feel absolutely ready.
- Gym: $40
- Spotify: $10
- Car lease and insurance: $270
- Gas: $120
- Credit card (mostly leisure): $100~$250 depending on how much I spend on going out. 724 FICO score according to Discover. $2,000 credit line. The balance has been paid, in full, every month since I've gotten the card.

The plan:

- 401(k): I'll be contributing to a 401k through MassMutual once I become eligible in a couple weeks. Employer matches 50% of each participant's contribution up to a max of $2,000/year. It's not the best match but I'll be contributing to the employer match, at least.

- IRA: I do not know much about IRA. I'm personally doing some research to learn more about what it is and how it works. I plan on maxing it out at $5,500/year.

- Student loans: I'll be enrolled into the standard, 10 year repayment plan that requires $347/month. I'm planning on putting about $700/month.

I believe I've covered everything that comes to my mind. In regards to student loans, I've gotten no help from my parents and I've paid every single cent of my tuition. A loan of $32,000 seems really daunting to me and it frightens me. 

Please help me. I do not know if I'm in a good situation nor do I know if this plan is really feasible. If more information is required, I'll be more than glad to provide it.

Many thanks in advance!

solar,"With all the credits, the financials (~30% ROI) seem too good to be true, what am I missing?","TL:DR, got a quote from a vendor in Louisiana.  After tax and company incentives, it appears I can spend $3,500 to install panels on my house, saving $1,000 a year in electricity cost or a roughly 30% return.  Is this possibly accurate?

I never really considered solar for the house I recently purchased until I saw something on my company site that they provide an incentive of up to $1,500 to install solar panels.

I got a quote from a participating vendor, and the financials seem almost like stealing from my fellow taxpayers.

To purchase and install panels for $25,000, the state of Louisiana gives me a check for half of that (my understanding is that I don't have to even have a $12,500 tax liability for Louisiana - they just send me a check).  The federal government gives me a tax credit of $7,500 (assuming I pay $7,500 in taxes to the government, which I do), and then my company gives me a rebate of $1,500.

So all totaled, I would only be out $3,500 to buy and install panels on my house.  

According to the solar vendor, I would be able to fit 18 panels on my roof, generating just under 8,000 Kw hours in a year - which would basically save me $1,000 a year in energy costs.

That's nearly a 30% return.

I hesitate to accept their assumptions because one of the other assumptions they made was that adding the panels to my house would add $17,000 to the value of the house, but I am friends with some realtors in the area, and they said at most $5k in value would be added - and if they could be seen from the house, could actually detract from the value of the house.  

So if they are augmenting, by a factor of 3, the value of the panels to the house's value, I'm worried they are also doing so for the amount of energy I could get from the actual panels.",energy,1412354756

personalfinance,understanding Average Age of credit accounts,"OK, so I have only had 1 credit card since I was 18 (now 26). It had a $5000 limit, when I was 22 I missed my first round of student loan payments after deferment came off and the hit to my credit score caused the bank to reduce the limit to $2500.

This incident caused my FICO score to drop to 650. It's been 3 years since then and I have not missed any payments for anything and rarely hit over 30% utilization. I think my score is in the 700s now but havent paid to check. Credit report shows what I expect.

I want more credit so that I can use credit to buy more things and reap rewards points. (I never carry a balance but now I am limited to only using 30% of $2500 = $750 on the card at once).


SO. If I open a NEW credit card, that will bring my average account age down to 3.5 years. What is the credit score implication of this and how long does it take to recover?

Would it be less of a hit to simply ask my bank to increase my credit limit? how would THIS affect my score and how long does it take to recover? this card has crap for rewards though

Upcoming reasons I need good credit (and am thus concerned about the time-impact on my score):

1. want to refi student loans to get my mom off cosigner status and potentially improve interest rate (avg 6% now). within 1 year
2. want to apply for a high-rewards credit card that I would need a score of 720 or more to qualify for (the sooner the better)

* 3 Credit Cards ~$15K total limit, 0 debt

* $74K salary (will be getting a 3-5% raise at the end of the year)

* ~700 credit score (Credit Karma)

I'm looking to buy a house in the near future. I have no intention of putting 20% down, even though I will have to pay PMI. The types of houses I'm looking at are in the low $300Ks. I need to get out of my current living situation ASAP. 

My primary concern is I have a derogatory mark on my credit score from 6 years ago (charge off). I'm aware that after 7 years it should be removed, it's just bad timing in relation to my current living situation. Ever since that single event I have never missed a payment on anything. In addition to not missing payments, I paid off 100% of my ~$35K in college loans. According to Credit Karma, my credit score is just below 700.

If I'm willing to accept the PMI (i know it's one of /r/personalfinance's circlejerks to always put down 20%), would anything I listed deter me from getting approved? What about home loan interest rates?",finance,1412360618

At the moment I have 3 cards and combined I have about 5k left on them. I am getting a 1k bonus from my work next month and want to put it entirely towards my debt. My question is: what is the smartest way for me to improve my credit score in the least amount of time? I want to improve it as fast as possible because the better my credit score is, I can take out a bigger loan to pay off my cards(right?). I have already inquired about taking out a loan with my current financial standing, and the largest loan they will let me take out is $2,600 if I get a co-signer. I would like to improve my credit score so they will allow me to take out a larger loan when they pull my credit score in a few months. 

Here are my cards:

Card #1- I owe $3,008 and my credit limit is $3,500. Interest rate is 19.8%

Card#2- I owe $875 and my credit limit is $3,000. Interest rate is 29%

Card#3- I owe $1,106 and my credit limit is $2,000. If I pay this entire amount off before 6/26/2015, I will not be charged interest.

Does it make sense for me to pay off card #3 (I can use money from my paycheck to cover the $106) and close it? Or should I get my balance of card #1 down so I’m not as close to my credit limit? Or should I do something else entirely?

I am already aware that it will take time for these changes to reflect on my credit score.. How long does it usually take?

Any advice would greatly be appreciated

This covers both me and husband. We have Successfully stuck to spending around 36-3700 out of the 4k each month, so the remaining 2-400 dollars has just sat in cash

technology,"Tom McClintock, U.S. Representative for California, responds to net neutrality email.","Thank you for writing regarding net neutrality. 

Proponents of net neutrality argue that it is necessary to preserve the free flow of information on the internet.  Without government intervention, they contend, Internet providers will block certain kinds of content – such as peer-to-peer file sharing and voice over internet provider (VoIP) services – and thereby stifle innovation and creation of new uses for the internet. 

However, enforcing net neutrality would require invasive government regulation and would bring with it a host of unintended consequences, many of which would diminish the dynamism and usefulness of the internet.  For example, if providers are not allowed to manage the traffic on their networks – networks they paid to build and maintain – there will be less investment in the up-keep and expansion of those networks in the future.  

Instead of investment-stifling government regulation, consumers should have access to their internet provider's network management policy so they can vote with their dollars and take their business elsewhere if they so choose.  On April 8, 2011, the House passed H.J.Res. 37, which would prevent the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rule from coming in to effect.

Thank you once again for writing about net neutrality.  I look forward to hearing from you in the future.

I am a 25 yo male, turning 26 this year and I am 90% sure I'm about to land my dream job (had my final interviews today and they went great).  I am expecting a salary offer of 60k+ a year with full medical/dental/vision benefits and a matching 401k with 100% matching on the first 3% and 50% on the next 2%.  I am really excited.

Currently, I have a decent amount of debt and I would like some advice on how to get rid of it, and when/how I should start investing.  I will list below the debt I currently have...

- Credit Card Debt: ~4,500 (This is what is plaguing me the most, it was a rough last few months searching for a job)
- Car Loan: ~16,000 left to pay.  Interest rate is 1.99%
- Student Loans: ~22,000

I am thinking that if I land the job and can get preapproval from the VA, I would like to buy a house in the Mt. Pleasant, SC area.  I found a killer deal on a practically beach front condo for less than 130k.  I figured if I could get my credit card debt paid off within the first month or so, I can walk down to the VA home loan office and get a rate of less than 2% (this was the estimate with my credit score when I checked in with the VA).

I would like to hear what you guys/gals have to say about this situation.  I really just wanted to pay off my debt first, but this deal seems like a pretty sound investment, even though I won't be debt free when making it.  I am fairly certain, with that low of a mortgage payment, I can rent out the place and have a positive cash flow.  Once a few years have passed I can be debt free with a positive influx of cash flowing from a rented property.

I recently purchased a used 2012 Camaro from Carmax at the end of May this year. I was approved for a car loan from Carmax with a term of 60 months, a 5.90% interest rate and the interest is calculated as simple interest. The amount of the loan at the time of signing was just shy of $17K. I made the first payment the beginning on July(45 days after signing the loan). Currently I am paying an even $300 a month even though the actual amount due every month is ~$281, and the amount left is ~16K with the payments I've made(on-time) since buying the car. 


My credit situation isnt terrible my credit history is just very young(~1 and 1/2 years old). I dont have any student loans, old credit card debt, or outstanding medical bills. I also dont have any late or missed payments on my credit history. The only debt I carry besides the car loan is my 1 credit card from my bank(which I pay off in full every month). The credit card started out as a partially-secured card back in august of 2013, with a limit of $500. Approx. 4 months ago, they removed the partially-secured status, and increased my limit to $2k. I recently made an account on Credit Karma, and my estimated credit score is 696. 


Now on to my questions: Aside from saving money on interest, what positive and negative effects would re-financing the car loan have against my credit score? Is right now too soon to try and re-finance the loan? Should I wait until I've made more on-time payments to re-finance?


I've started thinking about this recently especially after seeing re-financing offers on Credit Karma(not that I would apply without doing research) as well as offers from my bank to refinance the loan with advertised interest rates of 2.49% with a possible discount since I've been a customer with them for a while now.

Thank you for contacting me to express your support for net neutrality.  I appreciate your comments and welcome the opportunity to respond. 

On January 14, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down key portions of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet Order of 2010.  The court ruled that the order, which prohibits broadband service providers from blocking legal content on their networks or discriminating in the transmission of lawful network traffic, was invalid because the FCC had classified the Internet as ""information services"" and had misapplied regulations designed for ""common carriers,"" a classification limited to telecommunications services.  In its ruling the court clarified that the FCC maintained the authority to reclassify the Internet as telecommunications services, but that rules prohibiting blocking and discrimination are invalid under the current system. 

In response to this decision by the court, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and asked the public for comments on how best to safeguard and support an ""open Internet"".   The public comment period, which ended on September 15, was the most active in FCC history with 3.7 million comments being submitted. The FCC is now reviewing these comments and, while no official deadline exists for new Internet rules to be released, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has stated he would like to present a draft before the end of this year.

As you know, a major issue is whether the FCC should reclassify Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as Title II common carriers.  ISPs should not be allowed to block or unreasonably slow down legal content at their own whims, and I understand your concern that without Title II classification ISPs will relegate non-prioritized content to a ""slow lane"".   However, I believe there is no quicker way to ensure a slow lane for everyone than to reclassify ISPs as common carriers.  We must remember that the internet has flourished under minimal regulation.  Over the last 20 years, service speeds have dramatically increased.  During the same time period, the characteristics of telephone service have remained essentially the same, and this is no accident. Competitive pressures on ISPs push Internet speeds higher, while regulatory pressures on landline phone service have helped stifled innovation.  I am concerned that forcing all Internet traffic into one-size-fits-all transmission standards would not only reduce the quality of your Internet experience, but it would also cause us to forego future innovation on the network—something we cannot afford to lose.

The Internet has played a crucial role in this age of great technological advancements, and there is a reason for it.   As your representative, I remain committed to doing all that I can to ensure that innovation, competition and investment continues in this essential segment of our economy.  I look forward to reviewing the FCC's ""Open Internet"" rules when they are released with your thoughts and concerns in mind.  I believe there is a way we can satisfy the needs of consumers and keep innovation alive.

personalfinance,Federal &amp; State tax filing for HSA contributions made towards the previous year,"Let's say I continue to make contributions towards my HSA for the 2014 year in 2015.

My understanding is that a Form 5498-SA will be sent by January 31 and an updated Form 5498-SA will be sent after the April 15 filing date to reflect the additional contributions.

How would I go about filing the updated information for the 2014 tax year?

Would I have to file with the information from the former Form 5498-SA and then send an amended tax filing after I have received the updated form?",finance,1412392387
financialindependence,"low-interest student loan: payoff, overpay, or minimum payments?","I haven't seen anyone address this particular issue in terms of low-interest student loans, so I figured I'd see what you guys think.  SO and I are working on cutting some extra expenses, looking into investing in index funds, and considering what the priorities should be.  One of my main questions deals with my student loans.  My only debt is $16,000 of student loans, one at $5k at 2.080% and the other is $11k at 2.625%.  Minimum payments are $66/month and $87/month.  My question is, how much of a priority should they be, considering how low the interest rates are?  Even with paying $250/month on the smaller loan, we are saving around 34% of take-home pay.  We have an emergency fund plus other savings.  Should I drastically overpay, make minimum payments, or would it be best to strike a balance?  I'm new to FI, but very motivated.

personalfinance,It is my 2nd cake day and time to get my financial life in order.,"Quick Disclaimer: I have had an abhorrent history with finances. Parents never taught me anything about personal finance, so everything I know is self taught.

With that being said, I need help. SERIOUS HELP. I have debt (student loans), amounting expenses, and most importantly a baby (due in December).

Here's a quick breakdown of my debts/expenses:


Federal Student Loans: $24k w/ ~8% interest

Private Student Loan (through a credit union): $11k w/ ~8% int.

Auto repairs needed to be completed before baby: $800

Transportation expenses to and from work(monthly): $280

Grocery(monthly): $200

We don't have to worry about med insurance, I get excellent coverage through work.


Her Debts:

Federal Student Loans: $23k

She is currently unemployed so her loans are in forbearance (which is nice, for now).


We live with my fiance's parents so we do not have to pay rent/utilities but we like to chip in $100+ each month for their bills.

Income with no OT (monthly): $1632
OT 2-3 times a month

Fiance is currently in gestation mode and does not work, has an etsy, which pays for our miscellaneous expenses (dinner, lil shopping, small things).

We pay ourselves""rent"" $1000/month until the baby comes and we are ready to move, just so we know we can afford it for now. Student Loan payments are to begin Dec 1st, 2014.


Accounts:

Interest-bearing:$1100 - $1000 added each month until we move in March 2015.

2nd Savings:$900

Short-term reserve:$100

I have no Credit cards because I'm terrified of them.



I need to find a way to put off my student loan payments for at least a year, wherein I better find a new job or get promoted within. Currently, I don't think I believe I'll be able to afford moving out of my fiance's parents house in the 6-month time frame we have allotted ourselves to save, adjust to the baby and prepare to move. I just started my job 2 months ago and I feel that I need to have more time invested before asking for a raise, seeking promotion, etc. However, I have been told by clientele and other employees of the office that my senior manager has told them that ""I'm one of the best techs he has around,"" (I'm a Lab Animal Tech for an animal facility within a research institution). I've been trying to see if a 2nd job would be viable but with my family starting, I need to be available to my fiance to help her with him and not be bogged down with working to keep us afloat. I also need to be available to my current job so I can show that I care about working there and the work I do for them.

Here are my lists of questions given my circumstances and shoddy-to-decent financial knowledge:

How can lower/defer my student loan payments without accruing a buttload of interest?

What percentage of my weekly paycheck should I be saving in order to create an emergency fund? Is $6000 enough for right now?

I really want to begin investing, in Glass Technologies and markets dealing with graphene, among a few other future industries that look promising. How much should I put to the side to begin that venture?

When my fiance and I get married, can we consolidate and refinance our federal student debt?

When is an appropriate time to refinance my private student loan? Current interest sitting at 7.72%.

What can deduct on my taxes? More specifically, what expenses can I deduct from work? What expenses can I deduct from personal spending (baby things, auto repairs, etc.)?


We want to start a savings account for our son, one where we can only deposit into but cannot withdraw with a term of 21-years, where we deposit all his bday/christening money, as well as depositing $200 yearly, to be released to him when he's 21. Does such an account exist? We are more curious than looking for help, we just thought it would be cool.


If you have any advice at all about trying to get my financial situation in order, every little bit is appreciated! You all have a great community here, I love coming here to read and learn.

politics,When capitalism inhibits the market.,"I would like to propose the idea that capitalism and the market are at times at odds with each other.  This is going to be a long post but bare with me and let me know if there are issues with any of my arguments.  Capitalism is defined mostly as private ownership, whereas socialism is defined mostly by public ownership.  The market is defined as a system of competing companies offering similar products.  Markets work because if a customer thinks that the product from one company is bad, or overpriced, then they simply go to a competitor.  This creates incentives for businesses to provide the best possible products at the lowest possible prices.

Most goods that can readily be shipped around the country are in the category of a supply/demand situation where capitalism, defined as private ownership of the industry works fine.  However there are are many industries which do not fit the standard model for markets, I would like to use here the case of the 'natural monopoly.'  This can be a case where there is both a high cost of entry into a market with barriers of transport for the product or service.  The example in my text book was the power industry, most places in the world can only buy electricity from one place.

For my example though I am going to use the cable industry.  In a capitalist market a private company will have to put down a large cost to create a network of cables that go through the town and connect to every house that buys their product.  Due to the large cost of the infastructure it becomes unlikely that an additional company will create their own network of cables, and even if theydo it will require having an additional network of cables being created, a market inefficiency.  In this case we are likely to have one company, lets abbrievate this company TWC, which can then choose their own prices, choose what goes across their lines, and choose what service packages may and may not be provided.  It becomes unlikely that any customer has bargaining power for lower prices, or different packages, for the reason that their options are TWC's product or no product.

Now if we have the socialized system, or public ownership of the cable networks, then the government owns the cable lines that go through the city.  Any provider of internet or cable services merely has to connect a cable from the customer's house to the network, a significantly lower cost than having to build the network itself.  If this happens then it becomes more likely that multiple businesses will be offering internet and cable packages.  Meaning if you want different options, or think you can get the product cheaper, or even get fed up with customer service, you can threaten to switch to another company which may be more than happy to acomadate your requests to gain you as a customer.

If this theory holds then this becomes one point where a socialized system creates a market when a capitalist system inhibits the market.",finance,1412438336

Bitcoin,Let's band together as a crypto community and stop the in-house bickering.,"The other day I was speaking with a investor who had an interest in the crypto space, he was turned off when he came on some subs and saw all the bickering between the different communities within the space: e.g Dogecoin/Litecoin/NXT/BitsharesX/BTC etc.

We live in a new exciting era of crypto and we are fighting to gain ground on an archaic legacy system which had dominated the planet for centuries. We need to band together to push this technology forward without hurting each other, trolling has become a common place practice on the Internet and it is almost applauded: ""Lol that kid got rekt."" 

Although I don't agree with it, Let's leave the trolling for the banksters and fed backers and stand united in our belief of free money for the people, by the people.

personalfinance,Getting screwed by my bank.,"I am currently with USAA and have a credit card I have had since I was 18 years old. Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances through my 20s, I had to charge things a lot of the time (moving, laid off, etc). My credit card was at about $12,000 or so and my APR was kind of killing me. My APR for this card is 9.90%, which is in no way bad, but I thought I could find better. I was able to pay some of it down in the last few months but jobs haven't been steady. 

I decided to look into the option of getting a second credit card with 0% APR for the first year and transfer it over so that I wasn't getting hit with interest every time I went to pay the card down. I have a car loan through Navy Federal Credit Union so opted to try them. 

I went to their website and looked at their cards. There was one that said that it was 7.99% APR, which was better than what I had, however, I was still looking for 0% APR for 12-15 months. I sent an application in with a note stating: I currently have a USAA credit card that I am trying to pay down but the interest rate is killing me. I would like to transfer $10,000 down to a new card and I would like it to have 0% APR. 

This was a few weeks ago. I received information back that they were processing the order. About a week or so ago I received a text message that I had a message waiting for me at NFCU. I logged on and it says I was approved. Not knowing what APR or credit limit they gave me I decided to give them a call. I talked to a representative about the card. I asked how much the APR was and she said 7.99% with a prime of 3.5%. Okay, well, that isn't what I wanted. I let her know this isn't what I wanted and asked her if I should just hold off on it. She said I should hold off until they had 0% APR promotion coming up. I agreed. Eventually I received the card in the mail and haven't activated it because I was going to wait to see what was available at the end of the year.

Today I go into my account (USAA) and see that there was a posted payment for $10,000 on my credit card. I began freaking out. Surely this is a mistake? They have taken someones money on accident. I call my parents to see if they have an account with the last digits of this account that posted the $10,000 to the card. They do not. Now I am trying to figure out where this money came from. After searching, I decide to check NFCU because that was the only place I could think of. 

There it is, a credit card statement that says $10,000. I never gave them my account number for the USAA card so I have no idea how they got it. I immediately get on the phone with NFCU and they (verbatim) read the note I wrote on the application. I explain I did write that note but it would be silly (and stupid) of my to authorize a transfer to a worse APR. She continually says she cannot do anything because USAA already has the payment and that the best thing I could do is transfer the money back to USAA (of course, I would have to pay a $200 fee or 3% of the transfer). I tell her that is unacceptable. I don't think I should have to pay for something I didn't authorize. She says that she will get with the people ""in the back"" and see if they can change my APR but won't know until Monday or Tuesday if they will bring my APR down to the 9.90% that USAA currently has. 

So, what can I possibly do? I am on the phone with USAA now and they are telling me the only thing I can do is a transfer. Again, I am out $200 or 3%. So, am I just fucked? 

**tl:dr; NFCU pays some of my USAA CC off and puts it on an NFCU CC. I didn't officially authorize this. Now I am stuck with a higher APR at NFCU and they're telling me I can't do anything. Help?**",finance,1412444532

personalfinance,Advice for a senior in high school?,"I am a senior at an American high school (New England). I'm not too worried about getting into a decent college. My current top 3 are UCLA (50/50), USC (50/50), and University of Toronto (decent chances). I have a couple state schools that are safeties as well.

I have a relatively small bit of money in a savings account, ~$1000. I have worked remotely for web companies in the past, but not recently (last time was about 9 months ago), I paid taxes on this income, etc. Before my uncle died, he left money in a 529 account for me that's now totalling around $100k (I know, I'm incredibly lucky), but with the intention that I would only use it my junior and senior years in college.

I will be filling out the FAFSA ASAP (I think the earliest is January 1st); unfortunately, due to my parents having no mortgages, cheap rent and decent jobs (plus the 529 because it's in my name) I don't think I'll get much. I will be applying for scholarships, but I'm not expecting anything exceptional. Maybe ~$15k between scholarships and federal aid. My mom has offered to pay my meal plan for my first two years.

What should I do to minimize my reliance on student loans? Obviously, going to the least expensive school on that list will help. ($55k at UCLA vs $40k at University of Toronto, for example). I won't have the time for another job until this summer after I graduate, due to my school workload and extracurriculars. It'd be nice to find a local job wherever I end up going to school, because most of the online work I've done have been short contracts (~ 2 months or so). I'm not super worried about finding something locally, but if I end up in LA or Toronto I might not find something until I'm settled in, i.e. second semester of freshman year or so. If I do end up at UCLA or UCB, my goal would be to have met residency requirements by my junior year, but it might not be feasible until my senior year. That would cut my payment by about $10k/year or so.

My dream would be to graduate college debt-free. Even if that means taking out loans freshman year, I'd love to be able to pay them down before I graduate. Is that at all possible?

Bitcoin,An analysis of BTC fundamentals,"***Disclaimer:*** *This post is not an endorsement to either buy or sell Bitcoins. I am simply attempting to outline the reasons why there is inherent value in Bitcoins, as well as the risks that come with investing in a crypto-currency. In full disclosure, I personally own and use them, but only a very small portion of my overall portfolio which I would be ok if BTC went to 0 tomorrow.*

**Purpose:** I’ve been seeing a lot of doom and gloom (as well as irrational exuberance) in a lot of posts lately, and a lot of people saying this or that with no evidence or fundamentals to back up their claims. So I wanted to put my thoughts and experiences [more about me below] out there in the hopes that people actually serious about utilizing Bitcoins (BTC from here on) might find this information helpful, as well as to connect with and solicit thoughts from anybody else that’s done research on the future of BTC. Also **mods:** I searched through old posts and the FAQ but couldn’t really find anything like this, so let me know if there is a more appropriate place to post this. I can also add hyperlinked sources to this to make it a reference document if there is interest.

**Summary/tl;dr:** The fundamentals underlying the intrinsic value of Bitcoins haven’t changed. In fact, they continue to improve day-by-day, as merchant and user adoption increases. As long as this trend continues, and certain risk factors - see below - are minimized, BTC will eventually become widely accepted as a currency.

***That being said***, you should never “invest” more money than you are willing to completely lose, or money that you would otherwise need for living expenses. Otherwise, you are gambling. (I put “invest” in quotes because I believe BTC are currently far too speculative to be considered an “investment.” This may change in the future, but the technology is still so new, and there are so many unknowns, that it should not be considered anything more than a speculative investment at this point.)

**This has happened before and it will happen again:** This week hasn’t been good for those holding Bitcoins. In fact, if you invested in BTC anytime in the past year, I’d say it’s been a pretty shitty year, period. But the thing is, we’ve seen this type of thing in financial markets before, almost exactly to a t, and how they tend to play out. There have been various bubbles of all shapes and sizes throughout history, and the run-up in prices earlier this year, was no exception. However, unlike the critics, I believe BTCs are different, as there is significant intrinsic value in the BTC network and BTC as a value store - which I outline below.

I also think it’s useless to speculate about the direction of BTC in the short to medium-term (I would argue the price adjustment has been a good thing for the long-term), so to me the only meaningful way to analyze what’s going on is to examine the fundamentals (apologies if a lot of this is basic, but I wanted to cover all the key points as I saw them):



### Value:

* ***Currency As a Store of Value:*** A currency has value because the holders of it believe it has value. This might seem like a paradox, but it is how fiat currencies (namely, the USD and every other major currency in the world) function, and BTC is no different. As the number of people owning and using BTC increases, the relative value of BTC will have to grow as the supply is limited to 21million BTC (to use an economics analogy: In this case, we can’t find more seashells, we can only break the ones we have into smaller pieces).

    ***What if user adoption were to plateau or decrease?*** Even if growth were to stop today, and not a single more person in the world were to use BTC than already are, there would still be value assigned to them by those who currently hold, which is reflected in the BTC/USD rate. There is already value there by virtue of the number of people that own it and merchants that accept it.

    As of me writing this, there are an estimated 1.2million BTC holders on ledgers worldwide. This number is greater than the population of many countries that have their own currency. I believe BTC are past the point where people should question the viability of BTC as a store of value, and instead look at BTC for the value it provides for the following reasons.

* ***Worldwide Transaction Network:*** In my analysis, this represents the true potential value of BTC. Think of the major credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX) - they’re accepted pretty much anywhere right? You can walk into almost any shop throughout the world, and as long as you hold one of these cards, the merchant will trade you his/her goods and services for a portion of what you’ve got in your account. And this is **hugely** valuable. To the tune of $Billions per year these companies make in profit, all because of the network of merchants that accept them worldwide. But one thing that people might forget is these companies had to grow their merchant network, just like BTC, one at a time.

    Thus, this to me represents the primary growth potential of BTC. I’ve seen estimates that 10,000 retailers are currently accepting them, and there are some pretty big names in the list (Overstock, Target, eBay via PayPal, CVS). As the number of places that accept BTC increase, so does the intrinsic value. This also has a compounding, even self-fulfilling, effect: as the number of places that accept BTC increases, the value increases, thus more merchants are willing to accept BTC as a currency because it has value…chew on that for a second.

* ***Growing BTC Eco-system:*** This is represented by the growing number of Bitcoin-related venture startups and websites/wallets/apps that support BTC transactions. There is a network effect here, and as long as people are invested into it, will continue to grow.

* ***Security/Anonymity/Ease of Transaction:*** I think most of us are familiar with BTC security measures (how important the password to your wallet/account is), how the hashes are generated by an algorithm that cannot be faked (essentially counterfeit-proof), and low transaction costs. These are all pluses that make the currency attractive as a value store, with some caveats listed in the “Risks” section below.

* ***Hedge Against Fiat Currencies:*** This is a two-edged sword. I think there’s a lot of investment in BTC because of the fear of overactive Central Banks inflating other currencies (again, namely the USD), but as we saw this week, this can work against BTC. I explain more later below. 

So I’ve briefly outlined above some pretty clear reasons why there is inherent value in BTC, and the reasons why I personally am optimistic about the long-term future and will continue to use them. That being said, I’ve also identified **several primary risk factors** that ***worry*** me as a long-term investor, ones that all holders of BTC should be aware of. Please, if you know or can think of any others, reply or PM me so I can add them to this list:



### Risks:

* ***Continued market volatility:*** Price volatility might be good for day-traders, but for a currency, it’s killer. As described above, one of the core elements a currency must have is as a store of value, and if the price fluctuates wildly from day-to-day, merchants (and currency owners) will be less willing to accept it. Who would want to hold currency that’s worth 1/2 of what it was last week? 

    This is also a reason why it’s essential for the currency to have a limited supply (or perception thereof), or else rampant inflation would occur - look at Zimbabwe. The bottom-line is, if the USD (US Dollar) were to drop 25% in one week, like we saw with BTC this week, it would indicate a complete economic collapse was occurring. Faith in the currency would be destroyed, and it would take extreme measures to preserve it. It’s actually kind of a small miracle BTC hasn’t completely collapsed, but I think it’s because (1) there is real value in it, and (2) BTC are not widely used yet.

    The remedy for this is there has to be either (1) a large holder of the currency that is able to inject or take out some currency to keep the price stable -- if you look at the US Federal Reserve this is one of its two primary mandates, or (2) the number of BTC owners has to reach a saturation “tipping point” where enough people are utilizing the currency for day-to-day transactions, and not for speculative reasons. I don’t believe we’re quite at this point yet, but getting there.

* ***Governmental regulation:*** This is a big unknown for me, and with recent news that Russia and China have prohibited use of BTCs, presumably in the effort to curb illegal transactions, could become a trend. However, to address people who are concerned about this, I would make the following points:
    1. What is the reason for government regulation? Is it to curb illegal activity transacted in BTC? If this is the case, there is plenty of illegal activity being transacted in US Dollars, Russian Rubles, gold coins, jewelry, etc… What makes BTC special? If the reason is to prohibit a competing national currency, then that is a separate legal issue which will have to be resolved, but probably not until far in the future. In the US, a case like this would almost definitely go to the Supreme Court for clarification.
    2. Which government agency should have regulatory authority? In more democratic societies (than Russia and China) that have a strong rule of law (most of the rest of the western world), government agencies can’t simply do something because they want to (unfortunately the trend is changing even in the US). There has to be a legal jurisdiction or precedence that would allow this, and because crypto-currencies are so new, none has been set. For example, just look at how long it took most state governments to start taxing Amazon purchases. I used to live in Virginia, and they just started in Dec 2013, almost 20 years after Amazon was founded…
    3. How would governments enforce restrictions? Would it be by imposing fines on merchants that accept the crypto-currencies? Legally, how is this different than restricting payment in gold or silver then, or Craigslist transactions?
 
* ***Ease of use:*** BTC are not quite easy enough to use where the average person will find it appealing. I think a lot of companies are working to address this (e.g. the hardest part of signing up on Coinbase was remembering my password), so to me this risk is what we can do the most about, but still a concern.

* ***Loss potential:*** If you forget or lose your password, you’re SOL at this point. But this isn’t really different from losing cash on the street.

* ***Market Cornering(added):*** There is the possibility a large percentage of the total available BTC are owned by a handful of individuals. For example, it is estimated that [Satoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) alone owns ~1 million BTC. In the event that one or more of these owners were to attempt to [corner the BTC market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornering_the_market) there could be extreme price volatility.

* ***Current overall valuation may be a bit high:*** Back of the napkin calculation follows-    
    Total valuation of BTC = (# of BTC available) x (current price/BTC)    
    Total valuation of BTC = ~13million x $330 = ~$4billion    
$4 billion of perceived value is probably high for as small as the BTC network currently is. But, this number is reflective of the high growth rate in the number of users/owners and merchants that have accepted BTC. In other words, this may be a fair price. And, by definition, it is technically the actual fair price since it is, after all, an actual currency.

I could go on, but those are the major value and risk factors I see. If you have anything to add, please feel free.


**So, in the context of everything I said above, I’d like to talk about what happened this week in particular:** 

I believe this week’s price movement (as of me writing this, has been a 25% drop) is a result of several factors:

1. [News that US Dollar is very strong](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29445335)
2. Capitulation: I don’t have the ability to do Technical Analysis on BTC right now, but just eyeing the [1-year chart](http://www.coindesk.com/price/#2013-10-04,2014-10-04,close,bpi,USD), it looks like $400 was a key support point for the price of BTC. Once it broke through that, psychological barriers were broken and selling cascaded.
3. [Russia](http://www.coindesk.com/russia-proposes-fines-bitcoin/) and China potentially banning BTC

And that’s it. That’s all I can find about Bitcoins in the news. The value fundamentals I listed have not changed one bit, and if anything, the rate of user adoption has increased as more people are [learning](http://avc.com/2014/09/video-of-the-week-fred-ehrsams-bitcoin-presentation/)
 [what](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238103)
 [it is](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11138581/Bitcoin-will-become-the-new-gold.html).

Which is why I’m excited about the future of BTC. It’s a product that I use and like, and see tremendous value for. This week’s sell-off just means I can buy more.


**About me:** 

In a past life, I was an equity research analyst responsible for due diligence, fundamental/technical analysis, and making recommendations to the PM on which stocks a certain mutual fund should buy or sell. This meant reading through a **lot** of annual reports, financial statements, 10-K, 10-Q, shareholder calls, etc… My primary influences were Warren Buffett, Philip Fisher, and Ben Graham. If you recognize these names, you’ll probably guess that I was a value investor^1 , and you’d be right. 
The fundamental premise behind value investing, for those that don’t know, is that you can find companies that are trading at a discount to their “true” intrinsic value, and thus can make money by buying the stock at a low price and selling when the market has realized the fair value of the company and the price has subsequently gone up. This is essentially how Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway and became the world’s richest man (for a short period); his strategy has since greatly evolved, but this was the core philosophy he used for a long time.


^1 Utilizing this strategy, our fund bought a significant stake in AAPL when the price per share was less than the amount of **cash** per share the company currently held (split adjusted something like ~$2 per share when we bought). It hasn’t all been a bed of roses, we’ve made some not-so-great investments, but that’s a story for a different time :)

I want to find a good balance between saving and enjoying myself, and there are a few categories where I am completely clueless. I live in a fairly expense area (hence the high entry-level salary) but people here get by with far less. Here's what I have so far:

$4100 take home per month after state/federal taxes.

- $275 (or 5% of gross) 401K contribution (employer matches 100% up to 5%, 50% next 2.5%) 

- $1,300 for rent and utilities (may try and get a roommate to bring this down, but I don't want to live in a bad area)

- $290 student loan payment (27K paid over 10 years)

- $120 car insurance (no car payment)

- $200 gas for car

- $70 cell phone w/ data (still part of family plan)

- $350 groceries

- $14 dental insurance (will stay on parents' health insurance plan)


The areas where I'm stuck are: 

a) My minimum savings account contribution. I'm not sure what I should be automatically withdrawing for savings each month. 

b) How much I should budget for going out/dinners/leisure. I know these things add up quickly.

c) What I can expect for random, incidental purchases. Haircuts, toothpaste, new tires, etc.

personalfinance,How can I make the most out of my 20s (not in USA)?,"So, this sub has great advice, but a lot of the things I read don't really apply to my country (caribbean country) so I'm a little confused. I will try to convert the amounts to dollars so that you understand my situation.

I make about 1000 dollars a month after taxes, and my debts amount to about 1200 dollars (credit card and one loan) plus my student loan (about 18,000 dollars) which I won't have to start paying until september next year.

After I've paid the 1200 dollar I owe, I plan to take on a car loan, since I need a car urgently and I have no savings to buy one. I plan to buy the lowest priced car I can find. 

So, now that you know my situation, I guess the question is, how should I go about things? Interest rates are crazy in my country, the car loan will probably be around 12%, just like the student loan, and you can find bonds with higher interest rates. 15% even. So, should I just pay the mininum to these loans until they are paid off, or should I through all the money I can at them?

Should I start saving for retirement and investing? Or should I focus in getting out of debt as soon as possible?

financialindependence,A couple of newbie questions about taxes and inflation,"I've always been frugal but I'm new to the idea of FI. I currently save 75% of my take-home income (good!), but most of my savings are just in various savings accounts (bad!). I've set a goal for this winter to learn more about 'real' investing.

After reading some of the blog posts linked in the FAQ, I'm trying to build myself an FI spreadsheet to prove to myself that this can actually work. My numbers:

Savings: 1600 

After-tax yearly income: 700

Yearly expenses: 175

I've set an average inflation rate of 2%, which means my expenses are going up by 2% each year. My spreadsheet lasts for 100 years. I've set an after-tax interest rate of 4%.

That means at the end of the first year, I earn 700 + 4%(1600) = 764, spend 175 and thus have 1600 + 764 - 175 = 2189 in savings. At the end of year 2, I have 2798 in savings. Note I'm not getting really detailed about interest and expenses *per month*. I'm just doing it all on a yearly basis.


According to my current plan, I work for 8 more years. At that point my savings are 6917. The year after, savings are 6988 (the savings seem to increase each year even after I stop working). However, after 29 years, the savings peak and start to fall. After 65 years, the savings reach 0. This is due to expenses increasing with inflation. Does this sound right?!

When people speak about 7% returns, does that take into account both tax and inflation? What exactly is the ""drawdown rate""? I don't see where I need another rate.

Bitcoin,"Paul Krugman: a sniveling, dishonest Statist worm who defends a system that's far more of a ""cryptocon"" than Bitcoin could ever be. Shame on you.","Let's get this straight: you support an economic system that allows an insider's ring of politically connected finance wonks and academics to arbitrarily decide how much money will exist next month, a system which in light of the recent 46 hours of leaked Federal Reserve recordings is *completely* corrupt, and *completely* in bed with the banks it supposedly oversees and interacts with.

Mr. Krugman, it's not just Americans fed up with this system. It's people, everywhere. 

But no, we shouldn't evolve beyond that system. We shouldn't create something better, faster, cheaper, more accountable, more fair. We shouldn't advance our technologies and understandings of the world and how it functions.  

We should stick with what we have now: $18 trillion of public debt that can never be repaid, whole generations who have lost their homes to the banks and are in crushing debt, and another unnecessary Iraqi war fearmongered by the homepage of The New York Times -- Krugman's employer, and the former home of Judith fucking Miller. You would think the Times would have learned a thing or two about fearmongering for the Fed and promoting wars of choice, but they haven't: their ISIS fear game is top notch, and ignoring the fact that our ""moderate"" ""partner"" Saudi Arabia does equally appalling things all the time in the name of preserving its outrageous religious laws, the Times is going to do everything in its power to get a war weary public to say, ""fine one more time.""

This system capitalizes war, surveillance, economic protectionism, and a pointless drug war that has put *millions* of US citizens behind bars for ""victimless crimes"" - an outrageous phrase if ever there was one.

What Krugman and his buddies at the Times don't realize: this is our last chance. If we don't get the economic prosperity we have been denied, we won't be mourning Bitcoin's failure. We'll be mourning yours. All those protesters you see in Hong Kong? The same turnout will be right in front of The New York Times building, Mr. Krugman. 

We're burnt out. We're sick of your kind - media propagandists scaring people away from a good thing, trying to keep people enslaved in an old system that is highly inefficient and immoral to the Nth degree.

Fuck you, Mr. Krugman. History will be a judge of your actions and your column's impact on the public. You will not be judged well. Thoughtless mouthpieces for the establishment usually aren't.

personalfinance,Looking for reassurance/check on beginning financial account structure,"Hello!

This is a throwaway account because I'd rather friends and family not to directly tie my to my finances. I'm primarily looking for input on financial account structure.


###Background
I'm 22 and I graduated college in May. I landed a job that I'll be starting on 10/06/14 (Tomorrow). I'll be earning around $90,000/year as salary paid monthly. I graduated with no student loans.

- I have no credit score; it's just beginning to get reported

- With help of a family member, I was offered a 25k credit line at 5.41% interest for one year. I've used 15k of that line and haven't made a payment yet. Interest is calculated quarterly. The next(first) payment is due in November.
	- I've used the 15k to purchase a vehicle and to relocate to the city where I'll be working.
	
I have very little to no experience with budgeting and financial structure, so I'm working on learning a little bit each day. I have a working budget that will definitely need tweaking in the future.


###Setup
####Tools:
I use mint.com for my budgeting and logging, since it ties in extremely easily with my online accounts.


####Currently:
1. Checking: major bank; used for direct deposit, some automatic bill pay, budgeted expenses. No fees with the direct deposit I'll be getting. I've had this account since I started college 4 years ago (2010).

- Savings: major bank; tied with checking for better interest rates and no fees

- Credit Card: Discover it card, $1,500 limit. I will be using this for some budgeted expenses (gas, groceries) and paying the balance off in full every month.

- Credit line: hometown bank; 25k limit, 15k used. Can be advanced into checking account below.

- Checking: hometown bank


####Planned setup:
I have been reading several budgeting blogs, posts, resources, guides, etc. and have had a difficult time nailing down how I want my finances laid out. Here's what I plan to be working towards:

1. Main Checking: used for direct deposit of paycheck, bills (check, autopay). Accessible by checks, debit card, online banking. Looking at a major bank for the physical presense if I have issues/troubles. Transfer money to other accounts.

1. Budgeted Expenses Checking: used for budgeted expenses - gas, groceries, credit card payment(?).
	- I'm unsure how to structure this with a credit card, since I want to use the credit card to build up credit.
	- I was considering an Ally checking account for the no-fee withdrawl at ATMs and free checks

1. Regular savings: easy access, paired with main checking. No checks, access by debit card at ATM and online banking. Used for short-term surprise expenses. Examples: gas money for emergency trip home; unforeseen expenses

1. Emergency savings: difficult to access, online banking (?). No checks, no debit card. Considering Ally savings account for the 0.90%.

1. Savings accounts for each major goal I have (down payment on a car, saving up for a ring/wedding, TV, furniture, other major goals)


####Reasoning:
I used several websites to help me set up this structure:

[One][funcheap]
[Two][kip]
[Three][mint]

Obviously, I attempted to tweak where it made sense.

1. The reason for splitting checking was from [this][funcheap] website. Primarily, the plan is to not overdraw so that bills are still able to be paid. Especially with my nonexistent credit score, I need to make sure I pay all my bills on time. I also want to learn to trust myself not to overspend on budgeted items.

1. The reason for splitting savings accounts was from [this][kip] website. Mint also demands to track separate savings accounts for goals. I like to have that separation also.


###Questions
1. **Is my planned setup okay or does it need tweaking?**

1. **How quickly should I build my emergency fund?** I can build it rather quickly, but I don't want to build it too quickly and skip out on other items.

1. **How many emergency fund accounts should I have?** One quick-access, one harder-to-access. There's a CU down the road that I'm considering opening a savings account with so I have the potential for better interest rates on loans if I need them.

1. **Online banks?** I grew up in an area where a bank was somewhere that always had a physical location. If you wanted something from the bank, you *went* to the bank. Online banks are extremely new to me and everyone seems to be talking about/recommending them; are they legitimate? Specifically, is Ally a good online bank?

1. **Health savings account?** Do I need to look more into that?

1. **Do more accounts hurt credit?** My family keeps saying ""limit your accounts, it'll hurt your credit"" but nearly every article/FAQ I read says that more accounts will not hurt my credit unless they do a hard inquiry.

1. **Is it wise to have one savings account for each goal?**

1. **Retirement and credit line repayment.** Starting this late in the year, I think it will be hard to max out a contribution to an IRA. I don't know the specifics on my employer's 401k plan, but I'll have more information about that later this week.
I know it's usually said to pay off high-interest debit first; but while I do not have any high-interest debt, do I need to pay off the short term credit line first before contributing to an IRA? My thought is yes.


###Last thoughts:
My budget is set up for this month and I expect it to work farily well. If you would like to see it, I can certainly type it out. I'm currently setting myself up with 4000/month. Any left over funds will be split between debt repayment, savings, and underbudgeted items (after close examination of the problem).

Transfer fees may be a bit more important than I was thinking. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Thank you very much!

personalfinance,Construction Loan then 30-year Mortgage,"My wife and I are selling our home (just waiting to close now) and are planning to build another within the next 12 months or so. We are currently staying with her parents (at their insistence) to allow us to get some other debt payed off. Ideally I'd like to be in a new house by this time next year. What I am planning on doing is getting a construction loan, building, then refinancing as a 30 year mortgage. Some dollar figures to consider: We would like to spend between $150-200k on our new home. We will have ~$12,000 for a down payment any time we choose to start building. We will be able to put back probably $500-600/month over the next 10-12 months as an additional down payment amount. In September of 2015 I will receive a $10,000 bonus at work. At that point, presumably we'd have ~$25-30k to put down. My question is this...would you put the available $12k down now and begin construction (probably around the first of January), then refinance after I get my work bonus and put that money plus any other that we've saved as additional money down/money paid to principal? Should I try to wait to even start until this time next year when I have the entire $25-30k in the bank? I'd like to be in our new house by next October at least (baby due in May, plus I don't want to wear out our welcome at the in-laws), but I believe we can all buckle down and wait a while longer if that would put us money ahead in the long run. Something I am keeping in mind is that I've read about the potential for interest rates increasing in the near future due to some positive economic indicators.

Bitcoin,[Informed Debate] Compare centralized currency and current BTC asset distribution.,"Tomorrow marks one year since I joined the bitcoin community, and I'd like to first say how thankful I am to have enjoyed the ride with this sub. It's been memorable, guys.

personalfinance,My mom needs help - How to get her out of this hole,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, I am trying to figure out how to get my mom (53 years old) out of the hole that she has dug for herself. Some of the numbers I have are not exact, but my best estimates. She is not good with money and is terrible with budgeting. I've tried to work with her on it, but it is a struggle. It seems that every time she makes progress, she ends up taking two steps back. Here are the numbers:

* Monthly take home pay: $2400
* Rent: $1400
* Utilities: $200 (estimate)
* Car payment: $310/month
* Car insurance: $120
* Medical bill 1: $75
* Medical bill 2: $45
* Credit Card: $54
* Parent PLUS Loan: $90

Total monthly income (net of expenses, not including food, gas, etc.): $106.

I have tried to get her into a smaller, less expensive place, but it has been like pulling teeth. She also lives in an expensive city where she grew up, so she won't be moving somewhere much cheaper any time soon. She is also trying to look for side work to boost her income.

Here are her debt balances (don't know the interest rates for any of these):

* Car loan: $904.17
* Medical bill 1: $3,478.11
* Medical bill 2: $1,380.43
* Credit card: $2,824.72
* Parent PLUS loan: $7,528.62

Total debt: $16,116.05

I am fortunate enough to have a job that pays me decently and allows me to save money. Since I have about $10k in cash (not including my 401k), I want to help my mom. I was thinking that my sister and I could pay off her car bill to relax her of a few hundred dollars per month. After that, I want her to take all of the money from the car payment ($310/month) and start paying off Medical Bill 2, which would take a few months. If we do that, that'll take $355/month off her back and two loans. Then we would continue to pour in more money in the lower balanced loans until it's something manageable. Is this a good idea? Do you guys have any thoughts on this? I really appreciate the help!",finance,1412532872
Bitcoin,Book review: Thieves emporium,"Any one listen to [episode 34 of Bitcoins and Gravy](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/bitcoins-and-gravy-episode-34-enter-the-thieves-emporium)? The episode features the author of [Thieves Emporium](http://www.amazon.com/Thieves-Emporium-New-Badlands-Hernandez/dp/0988703009/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412079087&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thieves+emporium), a book that presents a very plausible near-future America where privacy is violated by powerful governmental regulatory agencies, personal liberty sharply debulked in the hunt for ""terrorists,"" and those that exercise their constitutional freedoms, while still legal, face harsh extra-judicial penalties imposed by those that control government handouts and those that control the payment networks.

How could such abuse happen in the US? The author uses the Federal Reserve's power of inflation, or hyperinflation, to show how populations can be controlled by controlling the value of their money. Those that profit from regulation and restriction, for example, sellers of items with marginal production costs, seek to maintain their profits by using government to stamp out those that offer arbitrage services (example, books and pharmaceuticals are sold at vastly different prices in different geographic regions). In a troubled economy, more and more people find themselves in the position of being poor but compliant with regulations or being able to earn a living by facilitating victim-less crimes (assuming decreasing the profits of big companies via arbitrage is ""victim-less""). 

How do ordinary folks in this future America earn a living without being imprisoned? Community. A community connected via encrypted internet communication, TOR, and anonymous internet access. 

Oh, and money. But not just any money. Money that flows freely between individuals, unfettered by regulations that ease its confiscation or theft. Digital money.  In function, if not form, the money used in the online community is very similar to Bitcoin.  In the book, the author shows how  populations can be controlled using paper money and how that can be resisted by using free money (free as in speech, not beer).

I'm not one for political conspiracies, but, I do think the issues raised by the book warrant thought.  The book is a fun and fast paced exploration of this world, in large part as seen through eyes of a struggling widow with young twin girls. The heroine is a survivalist. Not a computer geek, but a mother. A mother that will do anything to provide for and protect her girls. Her entry into the online community, called the Badlands, uncovering of a government conspiracy and ultimate escape from the country is a harrowing tale...and all too real feeling.  

I recommend reading this book!",cryptocurrency,1412534689
personalfinance,Need advice about buying a truck please.,"(I just realized there is a very similar question to mine posed earlier but there are several things different about my situation. I will take all answers into consideration, however. I asked this question on a different sub reddit and haven't got any serious replies yet, unfortunately.)

Basically my situation is that I'm nervous about buying a newer (2012) truck because I feel like my first time around left me nearly penniless. So here's what happened with that, and then I'll explain my predicament now.

I currently own a 2007 Nissan Frontier SE that I bought certified used in 2009. Although this has been an amazing truck since I've owned it, I bought it mainly because I didn't want to take on extra long-term debt. (I already have student loans). So I ended up financing through a dealership that talked me into getting a 12k loan with steep monthly payments. Even though I was able to pay down nearly half the value of the truck, my credit score sucked at the time (was probably around the 500's). Two years later, I was able to get through the hellish $500(+)/month payments. I see now that I could've just opted for a lower cost vehicle and worked on rebuilding my credit but I'm not sure how that would've worked out as well. Seeing as how I own my truck now and it's completely paid off and I've improved my credit score... it seems I'm in a decent position. 

Thankfully, I've also maintained the truck decently well too. It's still in good serviceable condition (getting regular oil changes), mildly driven, and only has 67,000 miles on it. But, this year, as I finish my last year of college I really want to make the switch to a larger truck because the Frontier just feels too small for me. So I've been looking at a 2012 Nissan Titan 4x. The main reason I want this new truck is because I plan on moving next year cross country (2,000+ miles) and could easily load all my stuff into it and 4wd versus 2wd would be more suitable in the pacific northwest. Also, the trade in value going down on my Frontier convinces me that I should act sooner than later to get this truck.

The Titan 4x that I'm looking at is priced at $28,000. Carfax checks out and it hasn't had any major issues. What I've considered is trading my Frontier in for it and taking a loan out to pay off the rest. But I am still a bit sketched out. I remember those days of high payments and they were really depressing. 

Today I checked my credit score and I'm doing alright with a 656 but I have a difficult time weighing the difference of waiting for a few years versus going ahead with a deal while my trade in is going to be worth more. I'm about 75% sure that I should wait and improve my credit score to get a better interest rate on a loan but sometimes feel like the difference is actually quite negligible. (Especially when I think about having driving in inclement weather.) 

It would really help just to have some clarity and reassurance on this. 

Appreciate all advice. Thanks",finance,1412535314
personalfinance,Opening checking/savings with Ally with no credit?,"Hello PFers!

personalfinance,In my early/mid 20's. Have ~$100k saved in an MMA. Need investment advice; currently unemployed.,"Hi all. I started reading up on investment advice last week, and have semi-educated myself on the different types of investment options via sites like Investopedia/Forbes/Fool/Boglehead/etc and have now stumbled onto /r/personalfinance, so I thought it'd be good to ask you guys for some pointers.

I'm in my early/mid 20's, have no debt, single, and have ~$100k saved up in a Money Market Account (from part-time work/gifts), returning an ""abysmal"" ~0.8% APY, which from what I've recently learned, is definitely not capable of keeping up with the annual inflation rate. This has thus sparked my urge to invest instead of letting the cash ""rot"" in the bank. 

* I'm currently not paying rent (parent's house), but will soon be moving out and have calculated that my monthly expenses will be around $1000/mo (includes rent/food/gas). I've read that I should keep at least 6-12 months worth of emergency funds handy, so I'll be reserving at least $15k cash in the MMA just to be on the safe side.
* As for the remaining $85k, I've been thinking of opening a taxable Vanguard brokerage account to buy a split consisting of: $40k in [VTI](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0970&amp;FundIntExt=INT) (US stocks), $20k in [VXUS](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3369&amp;FundIntExt=INT) (intl. stocks), $20k in [BND](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0928&amp;FundIntExt=INT) (US bonds), and $5k in [VNQ](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0986&amp;FundIntExt=INT) (REIT). 
* Since all of the above are Vanguard ETFs purchased from a Vanguard brokerage account, AFAIK there will be no trading fees to worry about, and are fairly diversified by themselves.
* One concern is: I originally wanted to contribute to a Roth/traditional IRA (tax-advantaged) but since I'm not employed right now, I can't do either. Nor do I have a company-matched 401(k) to contribute to (obviously).
* I've also considered investing in an apartment/condo/house (becoming a first-time landlord), but I figured REITs would be a less stressful option (don't have to deal with repairs/bad tenants). Low interest rates have me worried too, since rising interest rates in the near future likely means house prices/REITs would decline.

My question is, what is my best course of action right now? Employment is definitely my first priority. But should I wait until I have a job so I can start contributing into a matched 401k (if my future employer even offers that)? Or should I open a taxable Vanguard account ASAP and move the money out of my MMA? Furthermore, what are some other investment tips/routes that I'm missing out on?

personalfinance,Are one or both of these debt relief offers too good to be true?,"I was sort of surprised this isn't in the FAQ.

I have a debt burden large enough it's getting in the way of my goals, and I'm finally getting a big enough handle on what kind of a mess I'm in. I've had a few good months where I beat it down, but it's overwhelming how little progress I make per month.

I keep getting offers for two kinds of ""help"", one seems scuzzier than the other:

* The one I trust more simply offers me a loan with a low(er) interest rate for an amount ""up to"" my debt, and all the fine print and asterisks simply point out that they can't tell me how much they'll lend at what rate until they've done a credit check. It usually comes in on professional-looking letters from companies like LendingClub that at least don't show up as horrible trainwrecks from Google searches.
* The one I don't trust always comes looking on plain paper with a typewriter font telling me how much they'll save me. The part that seems too good to be true is they offer debt *reduction* instead of just a lower rate. They're bold enough to put their loan amount in the letter, and it's usually only 30% of my current debt. I don't have any of these laying around but they rarely have a company logo or anything else to make them seem credible.

The first case seems viable. It's a simple refinancing and is about the same as a balance transfer. So long as I'm dealing with a reputable lender I don't think they can go sour. In the past I've tried asking for this kind of loan at my bank, but they frowned and said they couldn't offer a good rate for an unsecured loan and offered me a credit card instead. Funny joke.

I don't really get the second case. They either severely underestimate my debt or they're promising to make years of payments evaporate. For examples of the kinds of terms they offer, if I'm $20k in debt they indicate I'll only pay $8400 by taking their deal. They can't be making money off of it, and I'm very suspicious there are strings attached that will be very bad for me, especially since they don't seem to have the money to hire some graphic designers for their pamphlets.

Am I right to be suspicious, or is this some kind of weirdo debt angel service that makes money in a way I haven't forseen? Are both of them shady, or just the second one? Would taking either make it harder to take advantage of potential zero-interest balance transfers later?

He has the following two student loan accounts:

- Account 1: $2.2k at 3.4% AND $3.8k at 4.5% (when he pays for this account, it deducts from the principal with the higher interest rate, that is the $3.8k at 4.5%)
- Interest accrued last month: $25

- Account 2: $1.3k at 5.6%
- Interest accrued last month: $7.7

My husband said that since Account 2 has a lower principal, the interest he accrues last month is only $7.7, compared to Account 1 at $25.

The morning that my dad splashed beer all over me when I was still living at home, i called her crying and she said to take a shower and go to school. She knew about the abuse but almost acted like it was normal. I tried registering with the disability office, but they've never accommodated a psychiatric disability before and the aforementioned counselor said i couldn't get any accommodations despite my psychiatrists reccomendation.

I really have been at the point that death seems like a valid option. I don't know, my mom says everyone feels that way so maybe I'm just needing to suck it up. All your posts though have given me the strength to make it through the day. Thank you. 

I don't even want to think about the breakdown of my each of my loans at this moment, but I have about 12 taken out (counting separate subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans), including 5 private loans.  Interest rates vary from 4% to 8%.

Two of the private loans that total about $450 a month are currently deferred only while I'm in school.

The debt comes mostly from two years in art school, for which I took out ALL loans for.  I was 18, had little guidance, and made a horrible decision; I know this now.  I wish I could go back and re-do it, so badly.  My aunt stopped cosigning my loan halfway through my spring semester of my sophomore year there, so I was left with money that was due and couldn't return to school because they wouldn't release my transcripts until I paid back some money.

I worked, but only on and off, because I was struggling badly with depression and anxiety that left me paralyzed at times, not able to leave the house.  My parents took all my money from my first job before I set up my own bank account, and then all my money I saved from my second full time job is now gone.  My parents took out a $3k loan for me to get my transcript to return to school for nursing, and I've been in school for that since fall of 2012.

My parents are abusive.  My brother as well.  I took out a $14,500 loan to live in the dorms this year because it got worse than it's ever been.  My dad has gotten on top of me and choked me threatening to kill me, ran down the hallway with a steak knife to his neck threatening to kill himself, and I was constantly demeaned with profanity and things such as ""fucking asshole cunt, I wish I could see the cops splatter your brains all over the pavement.""  I had to get out.  But now I'm dealing with the aftermath of that.  I'm sure they're responsible for most of my issues.  Additionally, my biggest support, my ex boyfriend of four years, broke up with me in the end of May.  I'm suffering thinking about that.

I currently work as a nurses' aide at a hospital and make $16-18.50 by working nights and weekend nights, but am only working once a week while in school.  It's too much to do more and I'm struggling as it is trying to do that.  I only have $800 saved from that, even though it could've been much more, because my parents have stopped paying for my basic necessities.  I worked a lot over the summer but paying for things on my own quickly dwindled the money I made.  I owe a lot each month for copays, cell phone (of which I have the cheapest phone plan I can), and food, among other things, and they have just stopped helping.  I gave them around $2,000.  Really, maybe more, I lost count.  They have made TERRIBLE financial decisions, including taking out a loan for a $16,000 car they can't afford, and are constantly late on bills and ruining their credit.  They can't be much of a help to me right now.  Yes, they paid my loans on time every month when I was out of school for three years, but they would not be able to do that this time because they don't support me withdrawing from school.  The abuse would get so much worse if I moved back home.

If I withdraw from school right now, I'd owe $40k (I think) to my current school immediately.  I feel like it's almost a necessity for my mental health because I've been having breakdowns constantly and have spent the last two days suicidal.  Really, I should probably be in a hospital right now.  Maybe not because I'm thinking of all of this?  Not sure, but I'm at the end of my rope.  However, the ramifications of paying that money back and moving back into the abusive environment is so much to think about and a huge burden.  I'd love to get an apartment, but even if I could get full time hours at my job, I wouldn't make enough to move out.  The payments for all my loans would be over $1000 a month.  I'm at a loss as to what to do.

Is there any way for me to work out a plan with my school so that I don't have to pay back the $40k?  I'm struggling with depression and anxiety so badly.  SO badly.  It's terrible.  I can't constantly break down and become suicidal.  I can't afford to not finish school but I can't go on like this.  Death seems like a much better option at this point.  No guy will ever love me with all my issues, never mind if I have all these money problems on top of it.  No matter what I do, my life is a complete and utter mess.  I don't know what to do.

Owe $120,000 (83,000 private Wells Fargo; 42,000 Sallie Mae)

Income $1500/month (full time, temp to perm, income expected to go up after 1st of year when I am hopefully hired on permanently. Hoping $2500/month).

Living expenses around $1000-1200 month.

Other info: I have no credit card debt. I recently broke my foot, owe about $800. Most likely will need a new car next year. I have a very supportive SO who refuses to let me pay more than $600/month on rent and will not let me starve. We have not discussed putting the majority of my income towards this debt as many other successful ""mega loan"" repayers have... That is a discussion for the future.


Sallie Mae has made my first payment due 07-Jan, around $400. I haven't heard from wells Fargo yet, but will be calling them this week. I am working on consolidating my federal loans and getting IBR for 25-30 years ....


My primary concern is wells Fargo. I have no idea how much it will be or how to handle them. I have read horror stories online about god awful customer service ...

personalfinance,Liquid assets account vs savings account,"So my bank (a small credit union) offers a member saving account, which I currently have money in and gets interest quarterly. They also offer what they call a liquid assets account with the same interest rate, but it gets interest monthly. The interest rate is fairly low (.12%) but it would still be beneficial as opposed to the quarterly interest of my current member savings. Is there anything else I might not know about this type of account? My bank has been pushing me to change my account and I really don't know why I shouldn't. As far as I knew before this a savings account was a liquid assets account but I guess they're two different things. Any help would be great, thanks!",finance,1412576866

Also, i assume many of the reasons for the drop in the bitcoin price are similar to those for the drop in gold -- the fed is done expanding the balance sheet, the economy appears relatively stable, and the dollar continues to strengthen. but unlike gold, there are many reasons to expect price growth -- more and more businesses accepting bitcoin, bigger investors are getting on board, technology increasingly requires this kind of instrument, winter is coming. so what gives?",cryptocurrency,1412600846

personalfinance,Going back to school for a Law Degree. What to do with Savings?,"My girlfriend is currently working as a paralegal and applying to law schools. She's been out of school for 2 years now and plans to go back for her J.D. next Fall. She has some debt from undergraduate studies and is wondering where the best place to save her money would be considering she'll be taking out huge loans to pay for law school.

- Her expected Tuition + Fees + Housing costs during law school will be $85,000 / year.
- She can reasonably expect to earn $15,000 / summer while in school from summer work or internships.
- She has a minimum student loan payment of $285 / month (still trying to figure out what the interest rates and how much is subsidized)
- Her company 401(k) offers great investment choices but wont provide any match until you've been there longer than she has.

______

- Will her undergrad student loans freeze while she's in Law School? (both minimum payments and interest accrual?)
- Should she pay down the student loans or invest in her company 401(k) / ROTH 401(k)?
- Should she save the money in a cash account (such as Ally) and use it to take out fewer graduate student loans?

She's not getting into law because of the money but I want to make sure she is as financially responsible as possible considering the amount of debt she's going to be taking on. Any advice on the money management side of things is appreciated, but I really doubt you'll be able to talk her out of getting her J.D.

She is only going to law school if she gets into Harvard, Columbia, Northwestern, Chicago, or Stanford. This is why the price tag on the degree is so high.",finance,1412604086
personalfinance,Finally paying off my credit card debt and building up my credit. Would it make sense to get another credit card?,"Over the last year, I've been chipping away at almost $5,000 worth of credit card debt I've accumulated over the years.

Credit Card from my bank: $1911 (Not sure of interest rate on this)

Credit Card #2: $113 (22.9% rate)

Credit Card #3 (Amazon account): $10 (Down from almost $1,100 this January!)

As of right now, with all the debt listed above (I also have some student loan debt, which isn't important right now) my credit rating sits at 745. After these cards are paid off entirely, I don't plan on using them for anything, except for emergency car repairs.

personalfinance,Me [21F] with my separated parents [47F/48M]I'm at a loss financially. (X-Posted from r/Relationships) [Aus],"Throw away for obvious reason. I'm honestly at a loss as to what to do.

4 years ago my parents separated when I was 17, mid-way through my university entrance exams (I'm in Australia so college=university). It was a messy separation as my mother still wanted to be with my father but he no longer wanted to be with her, my mum basically fell into an honestly pretty deep depression. For around 6-8months I ran the household making sure we had enough food, the pets were fed and the bills were paid, my mum would get up, go to work , come home and go to bed. After everything I still somehow got accepted to the best university in my state for my field. Eventually she got help and was placed on anti-depressants.

As my dad was the main breadwinner of the house (for most of my childhood my mum was a stay at home mum as I was an extremely sick child requiring constant care and lots of doctors/specialists visits) once he left so did majority of the income, he earnt about 3.5X more than her (by age 10/11 my mum had gone back to work). Basically from then on wards my mum and I struggled financially, while my dad did continue to pay the mortgage to “keep a roof over OPs head” my mum still struggled to keep up with the bills, keeping food on the table, the general up keep of the house and paying land rates amongst other things. It’s been this way for the last 4 years but the last 10-11months have been especially financially tough. I get government assistance for being a university student which covers most of my needs (phone bill, cat food, toiletries, transport costs, and now my own food aside from some basics) I pay for everything myself except for household bills (my parents firmly believe while I’m studying at university I shouldn’t have to pay rent or anything as I’m still a student, believe me I realise how lucky I am to have this luxury, especially in comparison to the U.S but it’s not entirely uncommon here in Australia for it to work this way) I’m at the point in my degree where I’m on clinical placement full time for 12months working Monday-Friday 9-4, but this work is free and I do not get paid for it unfortunately and taking a break from my degree to work full time to help contribute more financially is not really an option as I’m only about 12 months away from finishing, working on the weekends is not really an option either due to things relating to my health stemming from my childhood (working 5 days full time is tough on my body let alone 6 or more).

My mum is in so much debt and struggling to pay bills even now with the help of her long-term-live-in-boyfriend, ontop of all this she has a cancer scare going on which requires surgery in 5 weeks that’s going to cost $4,000 upfront, with 6 weeks unpaid work leave meaning no income into the household aside from what her boyfriend earns which is very little and my dad a few months ago started divorce proceedings, placing further financial burden on my mum as she has to seek out a lawyer (because hes trying to screw her over monetary wise). Aside from my dad paying the mortgage all this time, he hasn’t contributed to my life very much at all since I was 17. My mum has essentially been souly responsible since then. I’m at such a loss as to what options we have, all I see ahead of us is a black hole and no light at the end of it, our water and electricity is already being threatened to be turned off NOW let alone in 5-6 weeks time when theres NO income coming into the household.

I don’t really no what I expect posting here, but maybe some fresh eyes can come up with some better options because I just keep going around in circles.

TL:DR; my parents split up when I was 17, my mother became my soul carer and while I get some income to cover most of my own costs while I’m at university (including food and transport) we still struggle financially. Following some major financial hits all I see is a dark hole and no light at the end of the tunnel.

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Consolidation?,"This may not be the correct place to put this but I just need some advice.  I have about $42k in 10 private student loans through Sallie Mae.  Terrible idea, I know that now.  My interest rates vary from 4.62% to 11.75% (all of the loans are variable interest rates) and have a length of 10-15 years.  My minimum payment now is $525 as I am doing interest only payments on 5 of the loans (I was making $11/hr out of college with hours not guaranteed).  Come December my loans will jump up to $625 a month. 

My question is, is it stupid to try to consolidate my variable private student loans?  From Wells Fargo I received an approval to consolidate my student loans at 12% interest (fixed) with payments of $518 for 15 years.  If I pay what I would for Sallie Mae, $625, I can pay off the Wells Fargo amount in 9.5 years instead of the 15.

investing,I'm getting out the game.,"Time for some rambling.

Shut down about 30% of my taxable account today.  (Still beating the index in my Roth and taxable).  Do I think the market is going to crash?  No.  I still think we are going to hit 17500.  But what I have learned is I can't predict the future and sometimes my predictions take longer (BAC sold out today.  In at 15.03 out 17.30 but it took 7 months) and sometimes they go faster (CAG and the recovery after the earnings miss).  I've messed around a bit with options.  Lost some money there trying spreads and decided to go back to holding stocks and selling some covered call some things.  Great learning experience all around.

Over all it has been a great learning experience.  Some surprises included my munibond fund beating the s&amp;p500.  The Kinder merger was a welcome surprise. 

Over all I've been doing pretty good.  However, I'm back in school and I don't really have the time to research anymore.  KMI, AIG, and UBNT (which by the way I think is priced waaaaaay to low) are my main holdings in that order.  I'm also going to hold my 15k I have in a munibond fund.  It is up close to 10% ytd.  

If AIG beats earnings in Oct I might move out but I'm content to hold those 3, the munis, plus what I got in my Roth.  I'm pretty heavy into BCD's in my IRA which are down a bit.  I think if you are looking for an entry they are all very nicely priced currently.

I still will be investing into my 401k.  However, I don't believe interest rates are going to rise much anytime in the near future.  My job though steady lately, has always been some what unstable.  We just had a guy quit so that is good for me also.

So while I can't predict the future I can predict my house payment.  I've decided to just take the 3.8% return and I'm planning on paying the sucker off next year.  Baring job loss and a 50% market drop I will have the funds to completely pay it off.  Baring a 50% market drop I will have the funds to pay off my rental and my house.  That said I'm leaning strongly towards REIT's in the 401k instead of the rental but I'll probably hold it a few more years.  That said owning two houses sometimes sucks.

Long term I have been doing better than my current mortgage rate but that does me no good if stuff crashes again.    

I've gone through 1999 and 2008 bust.  Steady investing has yielded me a decent return.  That said I'm a pretty conservative guy.  After paying off the house I'm going to get back into the game.  

I've just decided to take the sure thing in this case and be happy with it.  It is ultra conservative but from a psychological standpoint I think I will be much better off just paying off the house.  When you own everything in this world outright what the market does then becomes irrelevant to a large extent.  I could work a min wage job to get by easily if I had no house payment and the rental was paid off.

Good luck out there.",finance,1412640008

Bitcoin,"PSA Cryptothrift.com security breach, loss of 15 BTC","&gt; In the early ours of Sunday 5th October, CryptoThrift was subject to a well-planned and clinically executed security breach.  Our hot wallet was compromised and our attackers managed to steal a little over 15 BTC of funds that were held in escrow.  The nature of the attack was such that it was not immediately clear that anything had happened, which is why it has taken us until today to take action.  

&gt;Fortunately the majority of users funds being held in escrow were safe in offline storage, so the impact of this attack was lessened.  Please be assured that any users that have payments or refunds due will be contacted over the next few days and your money will be paid.  The owners of CryptoThrift are absorbing the cost of this.

&gt;Whilst we have not yet completed our investigation, we have identified the attack vector as a vulnerability in a third party plugin.  This was used to inject SQL queries into our database and manipulate the amounts on transactions being released from escrow.  What we have not made public until now is that we have seen sustained and almost-daily attack attempts on the site for many months.  We have been in contact with the Australian Federal Police regarding this, and will be sharing with them all data that we have on this attack as well as all previous attempts.

&gt;This attack has prompted us to reflect on our security measures, and we have concluded that we need to make some significant changes to our escrow process, our storage of customers funds, and have a third-party conduct a full security audit.  Until this is complete, we feel we have no choice but temporarily suspend our escrow service for our users, as we simply cannot risk holding users funds.  Effective immediately, buyers will no longer be able to choose to use escrow when purchasing items.  All existing transactions that are in escrow will be honored until they are released or refunded.

&gt;CryptoThrift is owned and operated by two guys, both with families and full-time jobs, who run this site in their evenings and weekends to try and create something new for the crypto community.  We have made every effort to provide good customer service and have put 100% of all profits back into development, advertising, and marketing.  A such, the cost of this theft is being covered by us personally.  If our attackers wish to do the right thing and return our funds to us, they can do so by sending it back to 19bBwiFrAaCLxZZoS4grTDoFFVszxzvPMo.  If any of our users wish to help, we would gratefully receive donations of support to the same address.  

&gt;We must sincerely apologize to our loyal users for this breach and our decision to temporarily remove our escrow service.  It is heartbreaking for us to see our hard work destroyed by cold-hearted, thoughtless, hackers.

I'm an older - yet still *highly* immature, cool =) - redditor.

In my 15+ years in IT, I believe we're witnessing a shift between traditional ""in-house"" IT shops and the CIO to a more open, innovative, IT ""brokerage"" division.

Case in point: this [CIO.com artticle](http://www.cio.com/article/2603781/careers-staffing/6-hot-new-it-roles-for-2015.html) presents the 6 hot new jobs in IT for next year.

Of them, some are non-traditional IT staffed (e.g. #1) and while others play in this brokerage space, where nearly everything that can be is outsource (e.g. #2 and #6).

Gartner calls this the [Cloud Service Broker](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/cloud-computing/report/cloud-services-brokerage.jsp), and I believe it is a the way of the future.

Gone are the ""command and control"" towers of IT in an organization, replaced largely due to the cloud and consumerization, and the traditional IT role that go with them.

personalfinance,Repayment of Private Variable Student Loans vs. 401K or Saving for Down Payment on a House,"Ok PF, I've found myself in a somewhat of a predicament. As the title of my post says, I have the following dilemma: put roughly $24-$25,000 towards my student loan debt (total of approx $65,000) or use these funds to max out my 401k and use the remainder to put towards a home down payment. Here's what my loans look like:

* Variable $3,000 at 3.5%
* Variable $24,200 at 3.0%
* Variable $34,000 at 3.0%
* Fixed $4,000 at 5.0% (Perkins loan, no interest until Feb. 2015)

I was also dumb and bought a car I had no business getting. I now owe $18,000 on a 5 year note. Luckily it's a 0.9% rate.

Once I start automatic payments next month, my variable interest rates will drop by .5 points. Even though having 2.5% and 3% rates is great, these are still variable loans. My concern is that positive economic indicators will lead to the Fed raising interest rates in the near future (within the next 1-2 years).

Now, I'm a recent graduate living at home. I make $57,000 gross and won't having any living expenses until I move out next May. I currently am matching my employer's 401k contributions (5%). My current assets are basically:

* $29,000 in my various bank/checking accounts
* $6,400 in under performing stocks (was given shares as a kid. My grandpa was really big into buying stocks for dividends. These now pay less than 1% and seem to have hardly any upside)
* $6,000 if I cash out a life insurance policy. 

Now, if all my loans were fixed, there is no way in hell I would pay anything but the minimum with my interest rates, with the exception of the Perkins Loan. However, I dread the day these variable rates shoot up to 6,7,8% or more. So my question is: do I attack these variable loans aggressively now? I feel comfortable throwing about $24-25,000 at them. I still want to maintain a decent amount of cash on hand for any contingency that may arise, especially with my self-inflicted car payment. On the other hand, I could use this money to maximize my 401k contribution for the year and have money left over to put away for retirement while making loan payments. Any help is much appreciated!

news,Determining The Dollar Coin Value Of Your Rare Coins,"Have you been wondering about how valuable certain coins, that you have collected over the last several years, actually are? Although this would seem to be a very easy thing to do, sometimes the value of coins can fluctuate over the years. Valuable coins tend to appreciate, especially those that are extremely rare, but finding a book, or an expert that can give you an exact dollar amount can sometimes be a difficult task. Whether you are collecting US minted uncirculated coins in a set, bulk pennies, or silver dollars that are decades old, here are a few of the most highly coveted coins that you can collect that will potentially appreciate in value, and also how you can find out the value of the one's that you currently own.

&lt;span style=""color: #800000;""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Coin Collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

A very popular hobby that many people have, one that sometimes leads to a very wise investment, is collecting coins. The ones that tend to be the most valuable are those that were only circulated briefly, those that have what are called mint errors, and historically significant coins that are highly coveted by collectors throughout the world. Although many people do collect coins simply because it is a passion that they have, one that they do for fun, many people see this as an investment which can pay off handsomely depending upon which ones you are able to purchase.

&lt;span style=""color: #800000;""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Valuable Coins To Collect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

There are several coins that have been created over the years that have a dollar coin value far greater than their original intended worth. The 1913 liberty nickel head was simply valued at five cents back in the day, but due to its scarcity, can be worth as much as $4 million. The most expensive corn was issued in the late 1700s by the US federal government, a silver and copper dollar that was the first ever printed by the US federal mint. If you have one, it can pull in $10 million from savvy wealthy collectors. Unfortunately, most of us will not be able to locate these coins as there are so few available, but we can invest in coins today that will appreciate in value. If you do have collectible coins, here are some ways that you can determine the dollar coin value very easily.

&lt;span style=""color: #800000;""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining The Value Of Your Collectible Coins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

There are a couple of ways that you can easily determine the value of your coins, one of which is by visiting the Heritage Auctions website. They actually have live auctions in which they sell valuable and ancient coin collections, sometimes for millions of dollars. There is actually a handy price guide for beginners that are looking for information on the value of their coins. It is listed by denomination, common coins, and the average circulated value that you can hope to receive once yours are sold. Other websites including Coins.com and CoinStudy.com also provide valuable information. At the very least, you should be able to visit a local coin collector in your area that will be able to give you a fair price for the coins that you have for sale.

&lt;span style=""color: #800000;""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuable Coins In Circulation Today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

If you do happen to have some spare change lying around, it is possible that even the pennies that you have could be of great worth. In 1969-S Lincoln penny, which has a double die. This is thought to be valued at around $30,000, maybe more, depending upon the collector that you find. The 1982 Roosevelt dime with no mint markings is also valuable, though at a much lower price, rendering only about $50. You can also purchase coins that are currently being sold, especially if you invest into gold, such as the one ounce Gold Eagle BU. Although it may cost you about $1500, with the price of gold steadily rising every year, by the time you retire, it may very well be worth five figures.

electronics,555 PWM oscillator: Reducing minimum duty cycle,"Hey,

I've built this circuit to drive some LED strips (except I'm using a BUZ21 instead of the IRF530): http://i.imgur.com/1Khujcn.png

I can change the duty cycle via the pot, indicated as Rpot1 and Rpot2. The pot can go down to almost 0 ohm. However, there's a minimum duty cycle (which I *very roughly* estimate at around 3-5%) that leaves the LEDs still glowing rather brightly. I'd like to go lower.

The FET is innocent, as I've temporarily checked by hooking up the LEDs directly to the 555 (it can handle 200mA). I've tried decreasing the frequency by doubling C2, which didn't help.

I don't have a scope, so can't check the waveform. My multimeters also display crap when fed PWM.

Any ideas, short of using a different chip?",technology,1412662014
personalfinance,Selling a car that I owe more money on than I can get,"A little back story for my reasoning for selling. About 3 months ago I broke up with my girlfriend I was living with for 3 years ago for free. I ended up moving in with my parents again and the house they live in is more disgusting than a crack den. I can't bring people inside because of the embarrassment and need to move out and be on my own. I'm 26 so I shouldn't be dependent on my parents anyways. I have a 2006 Jeep Wrangler SE that I bought last year around march with a ridiculous interest rate. I got really ripped off by both the bank and the dealership but I can't cry over spilled milk especially when it was my own fault. 

What I'm wondering is would I be able to sell my car for around 10,000 and then pay the rest after in either large lump sums to get it over with or with another loan with a tiny monthly payment that I can just throw money at when I have it. I really need a plan of action to get my financial situation under control and cut this payment out so I can afford to be on my on.  I can create a new write up in a new thread with my entire financial situation if needed. I do not want to be paying for this until I'm 30 because I do not want to be stuck at my parents that long. I've included the loan information below.

* Loan Protection (Guaranteed Asset Protection):Yes
* Payment Protection Plan: Yes (Primary Loss of Life, Disability and Involuntary Unemployment)
* 14 Day Payoff Amount (By 10/21/2014) $12,357.40

personalfinance,Paying off student loans vs. credit score.,"Wife and I just finished graduate school. We moved out of state from where we were living and sold off our previous house with a nice profit. 

Excluding investments and retirement we have ~$90K in cash. Our only debt is student loans - between us totaling about $15K. No car payments.

In a year we'll want to purchase a house in our new location. We estimate we'll purchase something between $220 - $300k. Family income is ~$90K. 

Current credit score is 770. I want to keep it as high as possible to get the best mortgage terms. I would like my wife and I to pay off our student loans (interest rate at 6.5%), but I'm worried that it would drop our credit scores. 

I've thought of paying off all but $100 in each of our accounts to keep them open until we purchase a home a secure a mortgage. Is this a good/bad idea? Am I worrying about nothing? Thanks!",finance,1412693371
financialindependence,Why Pre-Tax Accounts are Best for FI,"Greetings FI-ers. There is constantly a lot of debate around this forum over wether or not to max out pre or post tax accounts. I'm making a few assumptions about the population of r/fi (which I'll list below) but I feel that for people seeking FI, pre-tax accounts are the way to go.

Edits: I got a few things incorrect below. 

* I havent had a 401k in 5 years, so I was unaware you are unable to deduct traditional IRA contributions if you deduct a 401k as well. 

* A conversion from a Traditional IRA to a roth is a taxable event and counted as income, not LTCG as I originally assumed. That being said you can still convert TIRA to roth at a 0% tax rate, but you can only do it up to the level of your deductions, not the top of the 15% tax bracket. Even if you put pre-tax money away when you're working in the 25-28% tax bracket, and convert it in ER in the 15% bracket, you're still saving 10%

* Exemptions were also not mentioned, but are ~10k for a single filer and ~20k for married filers, plus ~4k per kid.

* There are phase outs for deductions of traditional IRA contributions, which I forgot about since im nowhere near the point where I need to concern myself with that. Some of you might be, see [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2013/11/01/irs-announces-2014-retirement-plan-contribution-limits-for-401ks-and-more/)

* Finally, one thing that could blow this entire method up is future tax rates. We know what they are now, but we could be deferring tax into the future where laws could change and we'd end up paying a higher rate. 

Assumptions:

* Since you are here, I'm assuming you're seeking FI at an early age. Many people seeking FI at an early age have rock bottom yearly expenses, and I'm assuming you do too (Think post retirement expenses of &lt;35k/yr). Your expenses in FI may be slightly higher than that, but I'm assuming that this number will cover about 85% of the population here, if not more. 

* You dont like paying any more taxes than you absolutely have to. Im also assuming this applies to everyone here as well. (Note: this is only for taxes at the federal level, as I live in a state with no state income tax)

Now, on to the reasoning. 

When you're in savings mode, you'll be working and earning an income - a much higher one that you need to live on in FI, and you'll be responsible for paying all the taxes that come with having a high income. Since money we have to pay in taxes is not money that we can add to our stash, every bit helps. 

With a traditional IRA and 401k combo, you're able to shield 23k per year from taxes. For those with relatively high incomes, that may not bump you down into a lower marginal bracket, but for some of you it may. Of course, we arent just worried about taxes during our working years, we are worried about taxes in FI as well. Since we deferred taxes on those Traditional IRA &amp; 401k contributions in our working years, we have to pay them sometime in the future right? 

**WRONG**

Since you're here and planning to live on a low yearly income in FI (assumption 1), there is a bunch of ""room"" for you to convert money from pre-tax accounts (IRAs &amp; 401k's) to post tax accounts at a 0% tax rate. The key here is making sure you stay in the 15% tax bracket, where capital gains are taxed at the rate of 0%. Im assuming for most people in FI, that wont be that difficult, as it is your plan anyway. You can find the 2014 tax brackets [here](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx). 

If you're single, the top of the 15% tax bracket for 2014 is $36,900. That means if you're planning to live on 24,000 per year in FI, you have 12,900 worth of ""room"" to convert from pre-tax accounts to a roth IRA and still be taxed on those capital gains at the 0% rate. You can simply rinse and repeat this (while living off your taxable account and hobby earnings - if any - in the early years FI) until all of the funds in your taxable accounts have been moved to post tax accounts - paying taxes on none of the earnings OR the contributions.  Lets look at a few examples:

1) John &amp; Suzy are married, earning 150k/year, and interested in FI (I'm going to ignore taxes they pay here for simpler math - because the premise is the same). When they reach FI, they plan on living off of the luxurious sum of 30,000 per year, or 2500 per month. Each year, they both max out contributions to their 401k's and traditional IRAs, to the tune of 46k/year, bringing their taxable income down to 104k/year, placing them solidly in the 25% tax bracket during their working years. They spend approximately 40k per year (mostly work related expenses, such as professional clothes), and are able to save about 64k per year, which is contributed to a taxable account. 

Their savings rate is 66%, meaning retirement is about 10 years out. During those 10 years, they will have contributed 460k per year to their taxable accounts, not including any gains, and will have about 640k (before gains) in their taxable account. Deciding that this is enough, they retire and begin withdrawing money from their taxable account, at the rate of 30k per year. Once they hit FI, their balance (in todays dollars) should be around $635,556, assuming 7% returns. This moves them into the 15% tax bracket in FI, and the upper limit for married couples in the 15% bracket is $73,800, they have $43,800 worth of room to convert some of their traditional IRA money to a Roth IRA. Assuming spending stays the same throughout FI, they will have all the contributions to their retirement accounts moved from 401k/traditional IRA to roth in 15 years or so. This will also make some of those contributions &amp; gains (that were moved to the roth account) available for withdraw, if they need it. 

2) George is a single guy, earning 80k per year. He is aiming for FI as quickly as possible, so he is putting away 23,000 per year in pre-tax dollars. This puts him in the 25% tax bracket during his working years, and leaves him with  57k per year, of which he spends 27k, leaving 30k to save. His savings rate is approximately 70%, meaning his working career will last approximately 8 years. He's planning on living on 27k per year in FI. 

Once george hits his number and declares himself retired, he can begin the process of moving his pre-tax accounts to post-tax accounts, tax free. Since he is planning to spend 27k per year in FI (placing him in the 15% tax bracket), he can convert 9,900 per year into post tax (roth IRA) accounts. This will take him quite a while, but he does not care and has time. (this also an instance where single people get screwed when it comes to the tax code).

I didnt cover HSA's (because I dont have one, and I dont know how many of you people do) but it's about the same process.

I hope that this is clear for everyone, and if you have any questions let me know and I'll do my best to answer them. For the most part, my information came from this [madFIentist post](http://www.madfientist.com/traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira/), and this post at [GoCurryCracker](http://www.gocurrycracker.com/the-go-curry-cracker-2013-taxes/)

Note: I have nothing against roth IRAs, and in fact still have one (though this is the last year i'll be maxing it out, as I'll be moving to traditional IRA in 2015). If the roth can help you reach FI faster use that, if not, give this method a try.",finance,1412696323

&amp;nbsp;

Alright, so now that you know the framework for this week's thread, let's jump right into the information. 


&amp;nbsp;

### The Electoral College

&amp;nbsp;

First, let's start with a video explanation from the [National Archives and Records Administration.](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html)

**[Video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGoL1jYxu5E#t=62)**

&amp;nbsp;

You can also listen to the Stuffyoushouldknow Podcast that discusses the electoral college in detail.

**[Podcast Audio Link here.](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-the-electoral-college-works/)**

&amp;nbsp;

The Federal Election Commission also has a very detailed PDF about the electoral college that not only provides information on how it works, but also a full history. 

**[You can read the pdf here.](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf)**

&amp;nbsp;

Fairvote.org also has a great FAQ about the electoral college which you can [read here.](http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/national-popular-vote/the-electoral-college/electoral-college-faqs/)

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a succinct rundown of the most basic points that are explained in detail in the links provided above:

* The electoral college is a process and not an office, a person, or a place. 
* It was created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.
* Each State is allocated a number of Electors equal to the number of its U.S.
Senators (always 2) plus the number of its U.S. Representatives (which may
change each decade according to the size of each State's population as
determined in the Census).
* The [process for selecting Electors](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html#selection) varies throughout the United States. Generally, the political parties nominate Electors at their State party conventions or by a vote of the party’s central committee in each State. Each candidate will have their own unique slate of potential Electors as a result of this part of the selection process. 
* On Election Day, the voters in each State choose the Electors by casting votes for the presidential candidate of their choice. The Electors’ names may or may not appear on the ballot below the name of the candidates running for President, depending on the procedure in each State. 
* The winning candidate in each State—except in Nebraska and Maine, which have proportional distribution of the Electors—is awarded all of the State’s Electors. In Nebraska and Maine, the state winner receives two Electors and the winner of each congressional district receives one Elector. 
* There is no Constitutional provision or Federal law that requires Electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote in their States. Some States, however, require Electors to cast their votes according to the popular vote. These pledges fall into two categories—Electors bound by State law and those bound by pledges to political parties.

&amp;nbsp;

[Click here to view a list of the State Laws and Requirements for Electors.](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html#selection)

&amp;nbsp;

In most presidential elections, the candidate who wins the popular vote will also receive the majority of the electoral votes, but this is not always the case.  

Only four candidates in U.S. history have won an election by losing the popular vote and winning (or deadlocking) the electoral vote:

* 1824: John Quincy Adams, the son of former President John Adams, received some 38,000 fewer votes than Andrew Jackson, but neither candidate won a majority of the Electoral College. Adams was awarded the presidency when the election was thrown to the House of Representatives.

* 1876: Nearly unanimous support from small states gave Rutherford B. Hayes a one-vote margin in the Electoral College, despite the fact that he lost the popular vote to Samuel J. Tilden by 264,000 votes. Hayes carried five out of the six smallest states (excluding Delaware). These five states plus Colorado gave Hayes 22 electoral votes with only 109,000 popular votes. At the time, Colorado had been just been admitted to the Union and decided to appoint electors instead of holding elections. So, Hayes won Colorado's three electoral votes with zero popular votes. It was the only time in U.S. history that small state support has decided an election.

* 1888: Benjamin Harrison lost the popular vote by 95,713 votes to Grover Cleveland, but won the electoral vote by 65. In this instance, some say the Electoral College worked the way it is designed to work by preventing a candidate from winning an election based on support from one region of the country. The South overwhelmingly supported Cleveland, and he won by more than 425,000 votes in six southern states. However, in the rest of the country he lost by more than 300,000 votes. [Source: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html)

* In 2000, Al Gore received 50,992,335 votes nationwide and George W. Bush received 50,455,156 votes. The race was so close in Florida that ineffectively punched ballots (known as ""hanging chads"") required a manual recount because the voter intent couldn't be deciphered by machine. Eventually, Bush was awarded the state of Florida by the U.S. Supreme Court and had a total of 271 electoral votes, which beat Gore's 266 electoral votes. [Source: factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/)

Today, a candidate must receive 270 of the 538 votes to win the election. In cases where no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes, the decision is thrown to the House of Representatives by virtue of the 12th Amendment. The House then selects the president by majority vote with each state delegation receiving one vote to cast for the three candidates who received the most electoral votes.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, in January 2013, Gallup did a poll of Americans regarding term limits and the electoral college. [You can view it here.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/159881/americans-call-term-limits-end-electoral-college.aspx)

[Here is the data for the electoral college.](http://imgur.com/f7Hw159)

&amp;nbsp;

Gallup found that:

&gt; Large majorities of Americans are in favor of establishing term limits for members of the U.S. House and Senate, and doing away with the Electoral College. Despite sharp polarization of the parties on many issues in 21st century politics, Republicans and Democrats broadly agree on both longstanding election reform proposals.

personalfinance,I've been grinding and in debt my whole life. What can I do to get back to 0?,"Just looking for some insight on next steps. I've been grinding on debt with a million different methods, need to set a goal that I can finish.
Here's the background info on how I got into this mess:

Last year, I had reduced my revolving debt to around 6K. Not great, not horrible though. For work, I traveled by car all over the country, so I traded in last summer for a new car. In January, I decided to take some time off of the road, so I left my job. I took a new position near home, and it paid about 20K less per year, also no 401K, health insurance, etc.

I'm 32, a homeowner, no dependents, pay my bills on time, and pretty thrifty. There's no property tax, homeowner's assn., no cable TV, and I don't dine out. I've had a lot of problems adjusting my spending, and I'm actually in the middle of a no-spending allowed month, in order to recalibrate. So here's the ugly stuff:

**Take-home pay** - $1725 every two weeks (45k after taxes)

**Recurring Bills:**

Mortgage: $1031 (98K of 110K left, 4.25% fixed)

Car note: $525 (23K of 31K left, 1.9% 48mo)

Consolidation Loan: $463 ($2900 of 11K left, 12.25%)

Student Loans: $101 ($2,100 of $18K left, ~4.2%)

Electricity &amp; Water: Averages $190 monthly for both

Gas: Averages $110 per month

My recurring bills take up about $2,480 of $3800 per month (65%)

**Credit Cards** - I always pay all minimums, and then what I can afford starting with top APR.

Home Depot- $400 of 4k @ 26.99% (paying 0% right now)

Shell Gas - $0 of $1100 @ 24.99%

Wal Mart - $0 of $1500 @ 22.90%

Target - $0 of $500 @ 22.90%

Cap1 - $0 of $2250 @ 22.70%

Amazon - $801 of $2000 @ 22.24%

Kohls - $0 of $300 @ 21.99%

Cap 1 - $2505 of $3750 @ 17.90%

Navy Fed Rewards - $10763 of $11K @16.90%

HSBC - $0 of $1100 @ 14.99%

Orchard Bank - $1022 of $1100 @ 12.90%

Discover - $4050 of $4500 @ 0% until April

Chase Slate - $2100 of $2200 @ 0% until June

Balance of $21,730 of $37,100 available (58% util)

As you can see, the balances have all been moved to the lowest possible interest rate card.

I have some small assets, 30K in a 401K, 4K in stock, 8K in an IRA, no savings. I don't think the fees associated with making those things liquid will be beneficial. I have things I could sell, but for sake of argument let's say a yard sale would bring me $1,200. 

I have bad habits when it comes to impulse spending &amp; collecting junk. Should I just keep grinding these cards down, or make some kind of life-changing financial move? If I paid off the consolidation loan, should I walk right back into another? Sell the car? Sell the HOUSE? Get another job? No matter what, I hate having this much of a burden on my shoulders all the time; it's starting to wreck my sanity.

personalfinance,25f/26m making a dual budget for the first time. Advice is always appreciated.,"So my SO (26m) and I have been together for three years, living together nearly that entire time. We have shared credit cards and in the past have been 50/50 on expenses. After discussing it with him, I recently decided to do AmeriCorps for a year. Obviously, that kills our 50/50 dynamic so we are working on putting together a budget with our new incomes.


Basically, he works hourly with paid holidays so there will be extra money from 1) overtime 2) 3 ""extra"" paychecks a year 3) tax returns 4) bonuses. I calculated the weekly spend amounts based on his minimum weekly salary, assuming all of the above will go to building savings or saving for travel. We are going to combine our checking accounts and retire our personal cards (basically, stop using them but keep them open. Everything, combined and personal, goes on joint from here on out). Having one card and one account will help ensure we are staying on track. We have never fought about money, I trust him wholly (he's been holding my savings in his account for a year already) and I'm not wary about the joint checking account at all. I'm looking for an app that we can sync on both our iPhones that will help us keep track of how much we've spent and how much we have left if anyone has any recommendations. Not much of a fan of EEBA but Toshl doesn't seem bad.


I think I got everything but any advice you have would be really helpful. This is uncharted territory for the both of us. 


Now for the budget!

personalfinance,Tips for lowering Credit Card interest?,"I've had a particularly rough summer that resulted in the failing of my small business, and while I pick up the pieces I've been utilizing credit a little more than usual.  Currently, the only credit card I have is a Gap Card(it was the only one I could get two years ago, but it is nice to get rewards in the form of clothes, since I rarely spend on clothing anyway), and the interest rate is pretty high.  I figure I could just open up a new account with a lower rate, then pay off the gap card with it - or even look for a balance transfer account.  However, I'd rather not risk the pings to my credit score just in case, so I'm thinking of just calling, explaining my situation, and asking for a lower interest rate.

When I was 18 I opened a boat load of credit cards and of course did not pay them off, you know being young and dumb and all that.

Now I'm 30 I want to fix some of my mistakes but I'm not sure the best route to go. I have a child and that's my number on priority. I'd like to buy a house one day and be able to sign for a car when they need it and all that good stuff. 

Currently I have about $12,000 in debt, a lot of my debt seems to have been written off and all of that but I still have about $10k in credit card debt from the last 12 years or so and another 2k in medical bills.

My credit score is 570 but my history is just complete crap.  I can't open any credit cards and I haven't opened a credit card in over 5 years.  I just bought a used car in 2012 and got an 11% interest rate on it.

personalfinance,"$177,450 current principal balance on federal loans going into last month of forebearance: Advice?","Hello, /r/personalfinance! I've been looking into consolidating my graduate student loans recently, and I was hoping I could find some answers here. First, some basics:

- $177,450 current principal balance (all graduate loans, no undergraduate);
- $110,300 GRAD Plus @ 7.9%;
- $67,150 Mix of Stafford Subsidized/Unsubsidized @ 6.8%;
- Forebearance ends mid-November;
- Zero payments made;
- JD, practicing in California;
- $70,000 AGI;
- Most basic living expenses (rent, utilities, internet, food): ~ $1,300;
- I am pretty committed to a Fixed 10 Year term;
- Standard repayment through my servicer WITHOUT consolidation (10 years) would be $2,100/month and a total repayment of $252,600.  Standard repayment through my servicer WITH consolidation (30 years) would be $1,250/month and a total repayment of $446,600 (this seems out of the question); and 
- I do not plan to take advantage of either IBR or Loan Forgiveness, as I will be working in private practice.

With that in mind, here are a couple of issues/questions I have been pondering:

First, I have been looking into different banks with whom I can consolidate my loans, such as SocialFinance (SoFi) and Darien Rowayton Bank (DRB).  I have submitted applications to both institutions, and I have received Fixed 10 Year estimates of 3.5% to 4.75% (DRB) and 4.74% to 6.625% (SoFi).  Are there any other institutions that provide comparable interest rates for graduate (JD) loans?

Second, based on preliminary research, SoFi does not have prepayment penalties, while I do not know whether DRB has a similar policy.  For the sake of argument, let's assume DRB does have prepayment penalties.  In that case, is it more important to consolidate my loans with a bank that offers a very low interest rate (DRB between 3.5% and 4.75%) but does not allow for prepayment?  Or is it more important to have the option of prepayment where the consolidating bank offers a relatively higher interest rate (SoFi between 4.74% - 6.625%)?  Simply put, at what point would my potential prepayments outweigh SoFi's higher interest rate (and therefore higher total amount)?

Even if I consolidate with SoFi – most likely at a higher interest rate than DRB and paying a minimum monthly payment of $1,850 – I do not think I would be able to afford more than approximately $1,900 to $2,000 each month on my student loans – at least for now.

Further narrowing my second question: Would my being allowed to pay $100 to $200 more than my minimum per month with SoFi justify the higher interest rate, compared to DRB's relatively lower interest rate but inability to prepay?  (I realize I may be simplifying what it means to ""prepay,"" so if anyone wants to chime in with some basics about prepayment, that would also be appreciated.)

Third, are there are any other major issues regarding consolidating graduate student loans that I am completely ignoring?  If so, please let me know!  I am by NO means an expert in this area.  I am actually embarrassingly ignorant about almost everything finance-related.

I appreciate your looking at some/most/all of this thrilling situation, and I look forward to reading your comments!  Who knows, maybe we'll cross paths if you ever need an employment attorney! :)

Cheers!

EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT 

Wow, I totally forgot about this posting! Just wanted to let people know that I ended up not refinancing (yet). I took advantage of IBR and am using the avalanche method to hit my biggest ($34,780 x 3) loans with the highest (7.65%) interest rates first. So on top of the $656/month IBR payment (which admittedly does not even cover the monthly interest on all my loans), I throw $1,411.77 extra total per month at those three loans. My three biggest loans each have a $145.79 unpaid interest per month, but they each have different amounts due per IBR every month, so I have calculated the payment each one gets so that I am paying $450 towards principal on each of them every month. While most who are familiar with student loans know this, I asked my loan servicer to opt me out of ""paid-ahead status,"" which essentially means that after I make my interest payment on a loan for that month, the rest of the money I pay towards that loan goes to principal, rather than NEXT month's scheduled interest-only payment. Simply put, I'm treating my biggest loans as one $104,340 loan at 7.65%, and paying that down before I hit my smaller, lower interest (6.55%) loans.

As my monthly expenses normalize and my salary goes up (got a raise from $70,000 to $80,000 per year in December 2014), I'll be able to start throwing more at the loans and saving up more, so that one day refinancing might be feasible/a good idea.

personalfinance,Questions about W-4 withholding after buying a house.,"Hello PF, I have a few questions that I would love it if someone could help me out a bit.  Some info: single 26, 73k gross income, Just bought 360k home this year (suburb of expensive city, same size house 20 minutes down the road is 600k+, yikes!)  I put 11% income into my 401k currently.

First question: I went and filled out the IRS withholding calculator to the best of my knowledge and it recommends a withholding of 17 for the rest of the year.  I've had a withholding of 1 so far this year and have paid ~16k in fed. taxes.  Here is what the calculator states:
""Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2014 is $7,xxx. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $20,xxx withheld for 2014 resulting in an overpayment of $13,xxx when you file your return...""
Does this sound like it's even in the ballpark, or did I mess up in inputting something?  Only owing ~7k in fed. taxes sounds very low, but I've never owned a house.  Total itemized deductions were $17,xxx.

Second question: when buying the house I had to get a line of credit to get to the %20 down mark (~30k)  I've been hitting this hard so far, but was thinking about it tonight.  I have about a 2.5 month emergency fund at this point (slowing growing), but wouldn't it be better to put this cash towards my LOC?  That way it's not ""working against me"" so to speak, and I can use that money again by using the LOC if a real emergency comes up.  Does this make sense to anyone else?

One last thing I should mention is that I am bipolar and when manic will go on buying sprees and spend unnecessary money on things I think I 'need'. I am in the process of getting this under control which is why I have a service animal.

My stepfather recently offered to owner finance a house that my wife and I want, that he'd been renting out, it's not in the best shape, but it is certainly livable.

It's assessed value is 201k, he's offering to sell it to me for 150k, with 5k down, @ 5% 30 Year.

The interest rate is a bit high, but it is because he wants us to find our own financing, and buy out the mortgage, within 5 years.

personalfinance,Pay off student loans immediately or wait?,"My student loans are now in their grace period until I have to start paying them back.  

My husband and I are pretty well off.  He's been working as an engineer for two years and has already paid off his student loans.  He does have a car loan, but that will be paid off in the next year or so, and we paid for our wedding in cash.

I've been working as an engineer since May and combined we make about $137K/year before taxes.  We're maxing out our 401Ks and so our monthly take home after that is about $4400.  Our expenses are about $2500/month if I'm not forgetting anything major (we don't have a strict budget - both of us just have internalized how much our expected standard of living is and don't go much above that), and as of right now we've got almost $30k just sitting in our savings account.  And this is after our wedding and honeymoon have been fully paid for.  (can you tell neither of us are used to having money?  I was a grad student for the past few years and lived on ramen, and this is more money than my parents ever made growing up)

We currently live in an apartment and will be here until at least September of next year.  After that we've thought about looking at buying a house as houses are pretty affordable in our area (west Michigan) and the mortgage for the size/type of house we'd want would probably be less than our current rent (about $1000/month - we sprung for the washer/dryer, dishwasher, and garage)

Ok, think I gave a pretty good background - let me know if you need to know more.

I've got about $7000 in student loans.  All unsubsidized, all from the government.  What I'm wondering is what's the best way to pay this off?  I'm tempted to do it in almost one fell swoop just so I never have to worry about it again, but my husband says that's generally not the way to go as student loan interest rates are pretty low.

Additionally, my husband has a car loan that he plans on paying off sometime this year.  I honestly can't remember how much more it is, but I think he's been paying ~$200/month (overpaying what he has to - he bought the car about 1.5 years ago and it was about $17k)

Any suggestions?  I'm obviously utterly clueless on the whole personal finance deal.

EDIT: bot reminded me to look at FAQ.  Most of the info there (as well as info online) seems to assume having difficulty making payments.  This isn't the case here, so I'm really not sure what to do.",finance,1412772045

personalfinance,How long to pay off my loan,"Last month I took out a loan for a used truck off a dealership. The dealership had a loan application from Focus Federal Credit Union. So I applied and got called back saying I was approved for 15,000. I went to the bank and opened an account and once I got there they told me the interest rate was 9.5, this is my first ever loan of any kind. Pretty much my first of anything that is under my name besides my house which was purchased in cash. 

I forgot to add the dealership was asking 18,000 for the truck and once the bank and the dealership talked about how I only got approved for 15,000 they negotiated and let me have the truck for the 15,000 price. 

Well anyways my monthly payments are just about 320 a month for 5 years and I saw that at the end it totaled up to like 19,500.
But I can make the payments way more than that which is nice. If I make 1,000 payments every month how long would it take me to finish paying it off? 
And will I end up paying the 19,500 or will it be lower since my payments are going to be like 3 times as much?

I live in central Georgia and currently live with my parents, but I would like to move out as soon as is feasible, but I'm cool with staying for a while too while paying down my loans, as are my parents. 

My current expenses are pretty negligible. I pay 50 dollars a month for my cell phone. Gym membership which is 30 a month. 160 a month for car insurance. Everything else I make/made from my past job as a produce worker at a grocery store (about 1300/mo) has went to loans. I also plan to give my parents rent money now. They wouldn't accept it before, but I will make them now that I can easily afford it.  

I currently owe about 18k still. So what kind of advice do you guys have for me? This is my first salaried position and I know very little of things beyond the basic 401k information. I have yet to meet with HR and go over the exact benefits of my position, but I do know it has 401k, not sure about matching, but I plan to contribute as much as possible.

personalfinance,On the Phone with Debt Collector - Verification Needed,"Hello,

I am a student who has six accounts currently in collections. (5 medical bills due to anaphalaxis and non-consent ER/ambulance bills, one from an Express card I stupidly opened as a new associate and didn't have the money to pay off back in 2011 ($516). Portfolio Recovery acquired the debt in Nov. of 2013. I have been monitoring my Credit Karma account, and it shows a report date of 8/7/2014, and date opened as Nov 26, 2013. I am trying to figure out when it falls off. Has it been re-aged to 2013? I was paying it off for six months but stopped as I lost my job, and I had no idea about credit or finances.

My question is will this fall off in 2018 if I stop messing with it? The original date of opening was early 2011, so around maybe August 2011 I stopped paying it off. I am afraid it re-aged. I called the company and kept speaking in hypotheticals and saying I do not recognize this debt as mine. The debtor was very rude to me and told me a pay for delete was not possible. She said she notated it as a Refusal to Pay and hung up.

I am afraid of being sued or having it re-aged if it hasn't already. I've tried searching online but I'm still confused and worried. 

As far as other financial information (could use any other advice) - my CK rating is 564. I have 6 hard dings on my report, as I have been trying to get a secured card. The only one I qualified for was First Premier - I know it's ugly, but it's worth the fees to use it once a month on a latte and have something decent on my report. I hope to use it once a month and get the Capital One Secured in six months or so. 

I have one VS card opened in 2012 - again, young and stupid. Used once, paid off, didn't touch again. It's still reporting, but I can't use it to build credit.

I have a total of $2600 in debt, $560 Express Credit Card, the rest divided between 5 medical debt buyers. I am hoping for everything to fall off around 2019. I have student loans that were in default but are finally in forbearance now that I am back in school to become an RN. They total $6,800. The interest rate on the (unsubsidized) loan is 19.99%. I am looking at 2-3 more years of schooling. I receive Pell Grant for the first time, and I'm not working to focus on school. My SO just started a new job and is making enough to support us both. I am not asking him to help me with my debt.

If this doesn't follow the rules, feel free to delete. I just feel a little lost, and I'm trying to get back on my feet. I am not working now so I can go to school full-time and pull straight As to get into my 2 year RN program, starting fall of next year. Once I'm an RN, I intend to aggressively pay off my student loan debt, living off SO's salary until it's paid off. Should I then try to pay off my six collections accounts? 

And how do I know when the accounts were originally opened? Portfolio Recovery shows Nov 2013, when it was really in 2011. I don't know the exact dates for my medical bills, and I am hoping it's actually earlier than what CK shows, which I believe is when the debt buyers bought the debt from the hospital/ambulances. 

Again, sorry for the long post. Any help is greatly appreciated! I want to have the best credit I can for when my SO and I get married, for house mortgage in the future. We have been together for 3.5 years and intend to get married when I finish school sometime in 2017. We would be house searching around then.

How much should I spend on a new used car? I have a 2000 Honda civic now with 180,000 miles and it's a piece of shit with a lot of cosmetic damage. I could probably sell it for 1000$. 

Right now I am on my second year in a doctorate level program. The tuition is about 35k a year plus living expenses. I have taken out loans for the first two years already. I have roughly 25k in student loan debt at a lower interest rate &lt;5% that was preexisting. The loans i'm taking out now are half Stafford loan, half graduate plus loan at an interest rate closer to 7%.

Do I pay off part of my existing debt with this money? Or do I use it to pay for my tuition and living expenses until it runs out thus avoiding taking out new loans at a higher rate?

Do I invest this money now, and pay it off later?

Is there anything I can do to get money back from the taxes I paid? I am not working right now. I play poker maybe 1-2 times a week for extra money but essentially I have 0 income. 

Am I getting double dipped on taxes?

I need to figure out the best way to get the most out of this 65k in the bank that's sitting in a high interest savings account until I can figure this all out.

personalfinance,Sell the house to pay down student loans?,"Hi, my husband and I are trying to decide whether or not we should sell our house and use the equity to pay down my student loans. Here is some more detailed information:

We bought our house in the summer of 2011 for $150,000 (before I had student loans). We currently owe ~$138,000 on a 30 year mortgage at 4.25%. 
Based on current prices in our neighborhood, we expect that we would be able to sell our house for ~$195,000 if we spent ~$10,000 on upgrades and repairs. We like our house and love our neighborhood, but, we would definitely need to move in the next five years or so when we start having kids because there is only one bathroom and not very much space. If we sold, we would probably end up spending around $900-$1000 a month in rent. If we sell, we would probably rent for several years until we were able to pay off the rest of the debt, the cars, and save up a 25% down payment on a more permanent family house. 

I am currently in school and working part time. My income for the next two years will be around $12,000 a year. My husband makes ~$25,000 after taxes, insurance, and a small retirement savings that his company matches. I expect to make around ~$45,000 a year pre tax after I graduate in two years (assuming I get a job). 

Currently, I owe $47,000 in federal student loans. This will likely go up to ~$75,000 by the time I graduate. My student loans are at a 6% interest rate. 

Other debts: we owe ~$30,000 on both of our cars combined. We do not have any credit card or consumer debt. Our monthly spending is, realistically, as low as we can get it.

What do y'all think? Should we sell the house or stay?

We are on track to pay it off in a couple of years, but may pay it off earlier if we get any windfalls. I have a couple of questions about the logistics of paying off the mortgage, as well as what we can do now to prepare and educate ourselves.

1. What is the process of actually submitting the last payment and getting proof that we own the house outright? I am assuming we need to submit paperwork to the mortgage company, the insurance company, the local government, etc., like when we purchased the house. Someone who has experience with this, please walk me through the process.

2. Property Taxes: currently, we pay our taxes and insurance through an escrow account. How should we go about paying our taxes once there is no longer an escrow account? Will we just get a regular bill in the mail? Is there a way to set up automatic payments for taxes? I understand that if we don't pay our property taxes on time, our house could be taken away. I would like to set up failsafes for this kind of situation. 

3. HELOC: I have seen suggestions to open a HELOC on a house once there is no longer a mortgage. Apparently, this is for the purposes of keeping something in the housing category on a credit report. I investigated getting a HELOC with a bank, but it seems like there are a lot of fees associated with taking out this line of credit (e.g. $500 appraisal fee). We don't plan to ever take money out of the HELOC, so is it really worth it? Another HELOC question: interest rates are very low right now. Are any fixed-rate HELOCs available? Would it be beneficial to take out the HELOC sooner rather than later? How will the HELOC affect our credit scores?

However, once my husband and I decided on the Honda FIT, I discovered that the price difference between a lightly used car and a new one was around $2k. So now, we are debating between buying a new Honda FIT or a used Toyota Prius (not Prius C), knowing we would someday have to replace the Prius battery.

personalfinance,Will refinancing my car actually help me?,"I currently own a 2012 Toyota Prius and today I signed up for a credit union because they have better interest rates and I'm going to leave Bank of America. They mentioned that they would be able to refinance my car loan at a lower rate than what I have, but after researching online, I am not sure if it would actually save me money. Could someone please help me understand this?

Currently owe $21,535.32

Currently pay $517.49 per month @ 3%. Expected pay off according to unbury.me is May 2018 with $1,232.97 in total interest paid.


The credit union can refinance @ 1.66% for 48 months, leaving me a monthly payment of $464. Expected $738 total interest paid.


Or they can refinance @ 1.70 for 60 months, for a monthly payment of $375. Expected $943 in total interest paid.


Now, when I try to do the math on how much I will be paying in total with each option, this is what I get (please correct me if I'm doing the math wrong).

Current Loan: $517.49 x 43 months= $22,252.07 + $1,232.97 interest= **$23,485.04**

Refinance at 1.66%: $464 x 48 months= $22,272 + $738 interest= **$23,010.00**

Refinance at 1.70%: $375 x 60 months= $22,500 + $943 interest= **$23,443.00**


Assuming that my calculations are correct, the 1.66% refinance should save me about $475 in total amount paid and also lower my monthly payments, which is nice. Am I missing something here? What I still don't understand is how does this help the credit union if it's saving me money on the loan? What's the incentive for them? 

Also, I read that if the car is worth less than the loan you get negative equity, how would this affect me?

finance,Debra Hass &amp; Associates Certified Court and Deposition Reporters: Litigation,"An action brought in court to enforce a particular right. The act or process of bringing a lawsuit in and of itself; a judicial contest; any dispute.


When a person begins a civil lawsuit, the person enters into a process called litigation. Under the various rules of Civil Procedure that govern actions in state and federal courts, litigation involves a series of steps that may lead to a court trial and ultimately a resolution of the matter.


Before a lawsuit is filed, the person contemplating the lawsuit (called the plaintiff) typically demands that the person who caused the alleged injury (called the defendant) perform certain actions that will resolve the conflict. If the demand is refused or ignored, the plaintiff may start the lawsuit by serving copies of a summons and complaint on the defendant and filing the complaint with a civil trial court. The complaint must state the alleged injuries and attribute them to the defendant, and request money damages or equitable relief.


If the service of the complaint on the defendant does not result in a settlement of the issues, the plaintiff must begin the discovery process. This involves sending to the defendant written questions (called interrogatories) that seek information involving the dispute at issue. The plaintiff may depose the defendant and others concerning the issues, with the deposition recorded by a court reporter. The plaintiff may also request copies of documents for review. Once litigation commences the defendant is also permitted to use discovery to learn more about the plaintiff's case. The discovery process may be conducted in a matter of weeks, or it may take years, depending on the complexity of the case and the level of cooperation between the parties.


After discovery is completed, most courts require the parties to attend a settlement conference to determine if the case may be resolved before trial. If the parties are unable to reach a settlement, the litigation continues to trial. Near or on the day of trial, one or both parties often make settlement offers, in the hope of avoiding court proceedings (which are often costly and protracted). Litigation ends if settlement is reached.


If the parties are still unable to resolve their differences, a trial is held. At trial both sides are permitted to introduce relevant evidence that will help to prove to the jury or the court the truth of their positions. If the plaintiff makes a convincing case, the defendant may seek to settle the case immediately. On the other hand, if the plaintiff presents a weak case, the defendant may ask the court to dismiss the case. If the trial proceeds to a conclusion, either the jury or the judge (if a jury trial was waived) must decide which party prevails.


If the defendant loses the lawsuit, the defendant may ask the court to throw out the jury verdict if the evidence did not warrant the decision, or the defendant may ask that the damages awarded to the plaintiff be reduced. The court has discretion to grant or refuse these kinds of requests.


Once a final decision has been made at the trial court, the losing party may appeal the decision within a specified period of time. The federal courts and the states have intermediate courts of appeal that hear most civil appeals. The appellate court reviews the arguments of the parties on appeal and determines whether the trial court conducted the proceedings correctly. Once the appellate court issues a decision, usually in opinion form, the losing party may appeal to the state supreme court if the litigation occurred in a state court, or to the U.S. Supreme Court if the litigation occurred in a federal court. After the Supreme Court rules on the case, the decision is final.


Once a decision is final, litigation ends. The prevailing party is then given the authority to collect damages or receive other remedies from the losing party. After the losing party provides the relief, that party is entitled to receive from the prevailing party a satisfaction of judgment, which is filed with the trial court. This document attests to the satisfaction of all court-imposed relief and signifies the end of the case.",finance,1412818870

(2) Is it better to just leave the card open for a year?

(3) The store must have pulled my credit which I understand is another thing that can effect my score.  Does anyone know if I have a valid complaint about them reporting it as it was the employee's confusion?

finance,Is the economy infinitely divisible?,"What point does it [the US financial system] break down?

On our ability to pay down our debts?

We can divide the internal economy on dollar notes and credit notes that we also extend to the world.

However, when does it fail?

Does the feature of infinite divisibility and approaching 0% interest rates have a factor on anything?

I'm surprised, but our Federal Reserve seems to be keeping inflation at a moderate level.  However... how long will it last.

**Update**
The reason I asked this question is because I asked my professor in Business Finance if the Credit Ratings agencies didn't rate properly the bad mortgage bonds that were being resold during the 2008 fiscal crisis?  He said that the agencies that were rating them had some questionable relationship with the bonds they were rating... something about the system appeared to be on the verge of failure before the govt buyout of Freddy Mae and Mac.

So, that had me asking... can the system fail?

So I theorized that maybe the system is infinitely divisible?  Something based on things like the Federal Reserve and their ability to control their US Bonds that are in money supply which in turn all other bonds are based on (aka US Treasury Bonds are treated as a baseline to measure other bonds, the term basis points derives in the difference between US Treasury Bonds and a Bonds return, I believe, I am only a student).",finance,1412820120

personalfinance,Spinning my Financial Wheels,"Guys and Gals, I'm financially stupid. I am a 25 year old woman in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. I feel like I'm spinning my wheels and need help sorting how deep of shit I'm in. I'll be in honest in saying, my parents never taught my sister and I anything about finances. They did teach us however, about spending. Lots and lots of spending. I'm fed up and ready to get a handle on this. 


1. *The good*: When I turned 18, my mother told me to get credit cards and put all of my education costs on the credit cards...when I didn't have a job. So I did that, and really screwed myself up. The good bit of this is that I was able to raise my credit score from the low 500s to **614**. 


       
     
2. *The bad and the ugly*: Oh sheesh, where should I begin? I am in school full time (working towards my degree in English with a concentration in education. I already have my AA) and I work full time. I have about 2 more years left of school. I have been taking out loans to cover my education. 
   * I am about **$71,000** in debt so far. I work full time and I make **$48,000** annually. After tax, I take home about **$2,830.77** monthly
   * My expenses (monthly): 
      * Rent: **$1,485.00**. I live by myself in a one bedroom apartment.
      * Internet: **$49.73** This is internet only, no cable or other features.
      * Utilities: **$78.57** All utilities included here. 
      * Mobile (and iPad) with AT&amp;T: **$187.25** (I made the dumb choice of signing up for the at&amp;t next plan, so I'm currently stuck making payments on both the phone and iPad. I pay $25 monthly for the iPhone and $36.50 for the iPad. I have looked into moving to a cheaper plan with T-Mobile. This would require me paying the remaining balance on both the iPhone and iPad and a deposit of $450 to T-Mobile. My phone is not unlocked, which means a new device might have to be purchased.)
     * I have one secured credit card that I use and pay off on time every month. My credit limit is $750. The current balance on that card is **$749.71**. I am currently stuck in a loop of paying off the card and using it again. I really want to get out of this. 
     * Groceries, other needed household items, and cat stuff: **$350.00**
     * Laundry: **$20.00**
     * Transportation: **$259.00** (monthly bus and train passes. I do not drive)
     * Spotify: **$4.99**
     * Amazon Prime Student: **~$40.00** yearly
     * Netflix: **$8.00**

3. *Other important facts*: 
      * Sallie Mae let me know what my monthly payments would be for my student loans. They would be around **$650** a month when I finish school so far. This will increase as I take out more loans.
      * I do not currently contribute to a 401K. 
      * I am currently under my mother's health care plan so I do not have any costs there. 
      * I am paid bi-weekly. The first check is always **$1,413.43** and the second check is always **$1,417.34**. Because of this, I devote the second check of every month to pay for the rent the next month. It becomes very hard to budget and plan for an entire month. I find myself having absolutely no savings at the end of the month, and I am living paycheck to paycheck. 
      * I have old debts from previous credit cards totaling **$4,875**. There were a few more delinquent accounts that I paid off when I could. These accounts have almost reached the 7 year mark. 
      * I have a checking and savings with Citibank and also San Francisco Fire Credit Union (because again, my parent's said it would be a good idea to also have an account at a credit union). 


Alright, how bad is it? I am able to get out of this *horrible, horrible, horrible* cycle that I'm in? I desperately do not want to live like this forever, and hope that I can see financial independence one day.  I tried to be as clear and concise as possible. Please let me know if anything needs clarification or you have other questions. 


Thank you for any help that you can provide!

First, please don’t give me a “you should’ve done this instead” speech. I have heard it and given it to myself enough. I have also accepted that I have gotten myself into this situation and it is no one’s fault but mine.


Here’s the background information:

I live in the United States and went to a well-known university. I come from a middle class family and did not have a college fund. Unfortunately, I thought it would be a great idea to go to an expensive university regardless of no college fund and pay for everything with student loans. I went the full four years, and graduated with a degree in Human Biology. I got a Human Biology degree because I thought I wanted to become a doctor. Realistically, I was interested in science, but I think I just told myself I wanted to be a doctor in order to justify taking out a shit ton of loans for college because, hey, all doctors are buried in debt, right?! Why not just start the debt off with undergrad too?!  That way I can still get the away-from-home college experience and have tons of fun! Sigh, young ignorance.


Well, after four years of shadowing doctors and then graduating, I came to the conclusion I did not want to commit to medical school because I did not want to live the life of a doctor. I also needed to start making money. So, I decided I would combine my science degree and natural social skills in order to pursue a career in medical sales.


That’s when I found a sales opportunity in a startup company near me. The company is not in the medical industry, but I figured it would be a great way to gain experience in sales and the risk may be worth the reward. I’ve been there since August 2013. Management has shifted around and we’re now at a time where I think it will truly get big. I have moved from a sales position to an administrative position because the company really needed me there after an employee left. However, I have been promised that after we land this big account and get processes going underway for it in January, I will be given a role on that account and my pay will significantly increase (through the grape vine I’ve heard numbers like 65-70K, but I obviously can’t bank on office gossip). Therefore, I am giving the company until January or February 2015. If I don’t have a pay raise by then I’m out.


My job’s hours are a standard 9am-5pm, Monday through Friday. With my current starting salary, I take home $2,330.74 a month after taxes. This totals to $27,968.88 a year.


For my living situation, I am back in my parents’ house since graduating. I am fortunate enough to have loving parents who have told me countless times that I can stay with them as long as I need to in order to get myself financially straight. This means I don’t have to pay for food, rent, and other costs of living.


My debt consists of student loans and an auto loan.

 
All of my student loans are through Sallie Mae. The following is the current status of my PLUS loans, which are co-signed in my mother’s name:

Direct Parent PLUS at $19,502.18 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $19,245.76 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $18,860.66 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $2,696.21 with interest rate of 7.65%

Direct Parent PLUS at $18,564.63 with interest rate of 7.65%

TOTAL PLUS LOANS: $78,869.44

I have made consistent payments on these loans since December of 2013, when my grace period ended, and I am now making a monthly payment of $618.38 with about $118 going towards the principal and $500 towards interest. This is with a 25 year repayment plan. I switched to this from the 10 year repayment plan, because otherwise my payments were a little over $900 a month.


Here is the list of student loans solely in my name:

Direct Unsubsidized at $6,874.38 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $8,377.61 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $4,057.56 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $1,062.37 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Unsubsidized at $1,038.42 with interest rate of 6.55%

Direct Subsidized at $2,697.50 with interest rate of 3.15%

Direct Subsidized at $2,697.50 with interest rate of 3.15%

TOTAL DIRECT LOANS: $26,805.34


I have made consistent payments on these loans since December of 2013, when my grace period ended, and I am now making a monthly payment of $176.30 with about $44 going towards the principal and $132 going towards interest.  This is with a 10 year repayment plan. 

For both loans I have done the automatic withdrawal option in order to receive a slight reduction in my interest rates.

CURRENT TOTAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT: $105,674.78 (ouch)


For my auto loan:

The principal balance is $14,686.22 with monthly payments of $258.85 at an interest rate of 2.84%

TOTAL OVERALL DEBT: $120,363 (even more ouch)


Other than my loans, my monthly expenses are as follows:

Auto Insurance: $105.7

Contribution towards family phone plan: $25

Haircut: $30 (I know this is high, but I’m insecure about my receding hairline and have been getting my hair cut by the same person who works at a nice salon since I was 16 and going to her helps a lot with my confidence because I am always happy with the results. To me this is worth it. I’m just being as honest as possible with you guys)

Gas: ~$60

Social: ~200-300 (This is the hardest one for me, as I’m sure it is with most people. This may seem high but it’s more like my ideal number than reality because I always end up surpassing it. My will power is awful when it comes to saying no to social activities; regardless of cost. I’m a very social person with a lot of friends and being with/going out with them is something I love and makes me happy. Unfortunately, I always end up breaking my budget over it).

TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES: ~$420 to $520

TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES INCLUDING LOANS: ~$1574.23

MONEY LEFT OVER PER MONTH AFTER EXPENSES: ~$756.51

Within the last month, I have just reached my goal of saving up an emergency fund of $5,000.


After reading this far, you may ask why I haven’t gotten a second job. Well, since January 2014 I went through a variety of health issues that did not permit me to do so. However, I’m much better now and I think this is an option at this point. I have about 4 years of experience serving tables and I may try to find a second job doing that during weeknights or on the weekends, or maybe try and become an Uber driver or something. I think another element of this is that it has also taken me a little over a year to break out of denial of my current situation and accept that I need a second source of income. Badly.


I know that I should live frugally, which means I seriously need to work on my will power.  I know I should also attack the loans with the highest interest rates (PLUS Loans), but with my current position in a job where I’m not paid much and I’m simply waiting and hoping for things to pick up—it’s difficult to allocate extra money towards them. Should I consider an income based repayment plan? Or keep how I’m going, get a second job, live frugally, and hope my 9-5 job does actually increase in pay by January?


So, there is my story. If you’ve made it this far—thank you so much. If you have any advice—thank you even more. It would mean the world to me. I don’t really have anyone to go to and the reality of this situation throws me into extreme waves of depression and anxiety. I want so badly to be independent financially and out of my parents’ house. I also want to end this feeling of barely keeping afloat and that I'm stuck in a rut forever. It took me over a year to build up the courage to write this post and I’m ready to make some serious changes. If you have advice, please provide it.

EDIT: Sorry it has taken me a few days to get back to this, but I just want to say thank you so much for all the advice and direction you guys have given me. After reading the comments, I have contacted my friend who works at a restaurant near me and he said he can get me a job serving tables a few nights a week. I figure I will be able to make an extra $150-300 a week doing this, and it will also cause me to cut down on my social budget. I am also going to start off with the Snowball method to tackle some of the smaller Direct loans with my remaining income from each month in order to get the ball rolling and get the positive emotional drive to keep motivated in getting myself out of this hole. After I knock a few of those out I am going to stay focused on the PLUS loans because it just makes more sense to work on them since they have the highest interest rate. I'm going to use tools like, www.unbury.us which were provided below. I didn't know about that website--it's awesome. I am also going to stay at my parent's place for at least a few more years until my debt is significantly cut. As for my 9-5 job, I know a lot of people are telling me to get a different job right now. I am going to stay at my current one until January/February 2015 because if this company does work out, I'm at the ground floor and in a great spot to rise with it. If things don't change for the better like I have been promised, then I'm out. Again, thanks a ton, guys. I needed the guidance and kick in the ass this gave me. For anyone else in my situation; just don't give up, you're not alone.",finance,1412862462

Does anyone know what type of financial aid is available for those who already have a degree? Here's what I know so far:
- I do not qualify for Pell Grants
- Federal loans (Perkins or Stafford), not sure if I qualify

personalfinance,anyone want to give an opinion on two very different approaches to paying back my student loans?,"This is some pretty macroscopic shit.  So, I’ve got a ton of student loan debt, most from law school, some from UG -- let's call it an even 300k. Anyway, it’s essentially all federal. I see these as my options:

(1)** aggressive payoff** – basically the 10yr standard repayment plan, try to get it paid off in 7-8., I think that’s about as fast as it’d happen, realistically, and especially so if I don’t stay at a firm that pays the upper limit of the market the entire time.  Also, if I went this route I probably put like only 2k into savings/retirement a month, tops, each year I’m paying off the loans (so like 24k a year). Also, this approach basically requires that I try to stay at a firm paying market for at like 6-8 more years.

Under this approach, I pay off shit in about 10 years, and at the end of the day I’ve paid 124k in interest and 416k total.  This will or may be relevant when you get to the bottom of this missive.  Back of the napkin calcs using some simplistic shit online, it seems I might not be totally fucked for retirement if I took this approach and then in like 7 years got a decent paying job in the low-mid 6 figures and kept a reasonable savings/retirement funding going.  Again, it requires staying at a market paying firm for a bit. 

 (2) split the baby – payoff the loans at a reasonable clip, shooting for like a 15 yearish horizon, as much as I can while at a firm, see what happens as it comes, put the difference into a savings/retirement bucket.  Haven’t really thought through the ins and outs of this one yet. It’s neither hot nor cold but lukewarm and thus I spit it out.

(2)** Income based repayment** –***IF*** I qualify next year for the PAYE program – which, sparks notes version, is the relatively new income based repayment (IBR) program, which is like the old IBR, but better, and which next year is getting extended to borrowers who had fed loans prior to 2007, which I have and which is the only reason I’m not eligible for it now --***THEN*** I could make loan payments which would be capped at 10% of my discretionary income.  If you make 20 yrs of such payments, remaining loan balance is forgiven (though that forgiven amnt is taxed).  

I already qualify for IBR, even at my income level, bc the debt load is so high, and the test for whether or not you qualify is just whether your monthly payment would be higher under a standard 10-yr repayment plan than it would be under a given IBR plan.  That is currently true for me, and based on my back of napkin calculation and the calculator shit they got on the gov site, it will always remain true if I keep making the “IBR level” payments (i.e., by choosing lower income based repayments now, as opposed to being aggressive with paying it back, I basically guarantee that I’ll always qualify for income based repayments [bc overall amount owed is going down less quickly], unless I, e.g., made partner. That aint happening bc I don’t give a fuck).

Now, I could make use of this IBR thing now while at a firm and at my current income level, and instead of putting like $3500/month to loans and $2k a month into savings [which is what id essentially be doing under an aggressive scenario, with salary increases going to increases in loan payments], I could put, each month, like $1800 into loans and like $3700 into savings.

Another thing to keep in mind --  I don’t want to stay at a firm really, if I can help it.  If I can a non-firm job, or move to some other function at a law firm (I could see myself doing like professional development, or something like that, back office type shit), get paid like low-mid six figures in perpetuity to work  a low-stress, idiotic job that leaves me time and breathing room outside of work – I’d jump.  And it’d be nice to be able to do that.  And I feel like this IBR approach allows me to do that bc I’d always be able to put X% of my salary into savings/retirement, bc the amount going to loans would always be capped at 10% percent. 

BTW, I ran the PAYE program numbers based on a starting salary of 120k (if say I jumped ship in like 2 years and started somewhere at a figure around there) with normal like 3-5% raises each year, and  the loan repayment numbers work out thusly after 20 years:

$348,293 (interest paid)
$348,293 (total amount paid)
$382,412 Forgiven [basically, all principal + capitalized interest, which is capped at 10% of principal for this program] ( multiplied by 40% [tax rate] = ~$150k taxes). 
Approximately -- $500k paid.  Over 20 years.  

""Not that much different than the 10yr plan I mentioned above, and over a much longer period, and thus it seems the difference in amount paid in the immediate future under a ‘aggressive’ payback plan would be only that I was able to more aggressively save/invest.""  I.E. -- it seems like i wouldn't be losing much in terms of amount paid back, and id be gaining teh ability to put a lot more towards savings/retirement in the near term, in say, the next 3-5 years. Unless I’m missing something, which I may be, which is why Im writing this.

It seems almost too good to be true, but it’s been recognized that the people who might really get the best part of the bargain under the program are people with high incomes but also really high levels of grad school debt.  This might just be an instance of bank error/overinclusive effects of legislation in my favor.  That being said, when the regs get put in place by dec of 2015, there could be a hard income cap of some sort, and I could get priced out of it (as opposed to the qualifying formula now which is just based on debt/income and how that translates into payment amount under different repayment options).    That being said, I don’t want to be at a firm forever so I could take a lower paying job to keep my eligbility.  Also, I’d always be eligible for normal IBR (15% of discretionary income, 25 years). 

There’s obviously regulatory risk to this latter approach, but I don’t see them stripping the loan forgiveness aspect out of the program after so many people have relied on it. If it were going to happen it’d prob be in 2016 like immediately, if the House-Senate-Presidency all go R.  Also, if ‘I spend the next couple years aggressively saving instead of aggressively paying down loans, I could do it such that the money is available to throw at loans, if the regime changes from out beneath me.

personalfinance,Paying Remainder of Tuition Bill for this semester.,"Hello everyone, here's a brief background:

I recently transferred to Catholic University. Its a great school, but shit it's expensive. Over the last year my mom escaped rom an abusive relationship which left her homeless (we from a low socioeconomic status, REALLY low). My dad has remarried and has his own bills, he tried to cosign a loan for me but got denied due to some recent troubles with his business, and can't afford to help me anymore.

My bill right now for CUA is about $14,000, however, my EFC was about 2,000, which is an insane gap. I filed an appeal over a month ago and still am waiting for a response. Right now I'm living on campus because I was told that I was required for my first year, but they never told me that didn't apply if I was 21, so I just filed that appeal as well so I can move back in with my friend and save a shit ton. (room + board ≈ $8,000). I am estimated that y next semester, if I move off campus, I would be able to afford the tuition, and by next year when I am considered independent for a risk of homelessness I would be able to cover that difference in federal loans. 

My question is:
Are there any other options for paying the bill for this semester so that I can just register for next semester and finish college? I really just need to get through this heap and the rest could be taken care of. Banks have denied my dad, but are there any other options? Please help!

personalfinance,help with some personal finances/goals please!,"Hello everybody. I saw a personal finance post on the front page and realized I've been going through my own finances and would love an outside perspective or opinion.

Debts:
Car (2014 Corolla): $16432 remaining, $302 a month @ 1.49%

Personal loan: $16113, $467 a month @ 2.99%

Credit card consolidation loan: $5006, $249 a month @ 16.75%

Fed student loans: ~$17000, $125 a month, variable rates between 4.5 and 7%

Loan from my father: $3750, $125 a month, no interest

""Mortgage"" (cash borrowed from my father to purchase a house, on paper I own it outright though): $41495, $555 a month @ 3% interest

Total debts: $99796, $1823 a month in payments

Monthly take home pay after taxes: $4100 until July 2015, about $4600 a month from July 2015 to July 2016, about $5200 a month after that for a few months possibly longer (I'm military). Only have guaranteed pay until September 2016 but potentially longer if I can figure out how to get my time on station extended. Either way I'm seperating from the military around my four year mark.

""expendable income"" after mandatory monthly payments: $2277

Other payments:
Water: about 25 a month

Electricity: about 75 a month

Internet: about 80 a month

Phone: about 140 a month

Cigarettes: about 150 a month

Groceries/food: variable because I am single and eat out a lot. I don't budget for food, I just eat accordingly depending on what's left in my bank account.

Gas: about 250 a month

Other non-essential payments:

Netflix: 8 a month?

That total = approx 750 dollars

Money left afterwards = about $1520??. This goes to food and random splurge purchases. My brother currently lives with me and splits rent and utilities, currently paying me 360 a month, so new total after all expenses = 1880 a month.

Zero money in savings

approximately $7600 available balance on two credit cards (zero balance on credit cards)

I live paycheck to paycheck even though I could be saving money.

I know I need to accelerate payments on my cc consolidation loan. I just recently got that because it was slightly lower than the 20% interest I was paying. 

I want to purchase another home in the next year or two, but I don't know if that's a good idea. My girlfriend lives about an hour from me, I don't have a mortgage because I pay my father back ""rent"" towards a loan he gave me, and I'll be going back to school after I get out of the military, and the university is close to where her job is anyway. So I've been thinking about getting a mortgage and moving closer to her, commuting to work in the meantime, and renting out the house I'm currently in.

I bought the house I'm in now for $35000. It was built in 2007, someone lived in it for a few years then foreclosed, was vacant for 3 years, someone stole the heat pump off the back of the house for copper, so it didn't qualify for a traditional mortgage. I bought it with ""cash"" and put about $7k repairs in it. It's valued at $129000 but that is a load of crap, so I'll be going at tax time to dispute that total for my taxes. Due to state laws regarding military I only pay one third of property taxes for my state. So I pay one third of whatever 6% ends up being. For what I bought the house for it will be about 600 a year in taxes.

The housing market is really good right now where I live for buyers, so I'm wondering how to financially prepare myself to buy another home. I'm wondering what the best timing for that purchase would be, whether it's pay off some debt I have first before getting into one, what I need to save or what things I need to do to prepare my credit to get a great rate etc. I also qualify for a VA loan so I have that to use if needed.

Any general financial tips to improve my situation? How much should I save vs paying down debt? Just looking for any guidance whatsoever to consider. I've gotten where I am today just by doing what I thought was smart, but I'm very undisciplined when it comes to saving money. I always pay my bills but I always find a way to be broke the night before I get paid again.

Thanks in advance.

I have never had any major loans like a car loan. I had a credit card and abused that when I was 18 (Currently 25)

My finances are in poor shape at the moment. I could work a car note into the budget, but I know without even looking at my credit report my interest rates are going to be absolutely brutal. (I hear credit unions may be a better lender than a bank when interest is concerned)

-One out of state emergency room bill that was like 1200 in 2012.

personalfinance,Is an ARM a good choice if we are certain we will refinance the house to get rid of PMI on a FHA mortgage?,"My wife and I are looking at purchasing a house at some point in the future.  We are still years away, but at this point it appears that an FHA loan would work out for us.  We realize that putting down a full 20% would be ideal, but we are looking at other options as well. 

We would be willing to pay some PMI, but only for a short amount of time.  With FHA's new guidelines, we would be paying PMI for a minimum of 11 years with the downpayment we are shooting for, which we think is way too long. 

If I look at the amortization schedule for a mortgage, assuming no change in the value of the house, it would only take 6 years to reach 78% LTV on a house after placing 10% down.  I realize that the value of the home can go down, but I think assuming no change in the assessed value of the house is a good assumption.  We live in a section of the country that saw a very small decrease in home values in 2008.

With these figures, it seems like it would make sense to refinance the house around the 5-7 year range.  With that in mind, is there any reason not to take a 5 or 7 year ARM in order to benefit from the lower interest rate for that first few years?",finance,1412872688

After receiving my paycheck, paying all bills, rent, etc, I have around 5k sitting in my bank account. This is mainly because I sold my car midway through last month (not for much, $2.5k). 

Aside from ~$3k in credit card debt (0% APR for another 6 months) I have the following student loans : 

* Subsidized $4,985.04 @3.15%
* Subsidized $4,930.15 @4.25%
* Subsidized $3,228.83 @5.35%
* Subsidized $3,137.35 @5.75%
* Unsubsidized $980.49 @6.55%

Now, I know most people might suggest I save this money as an ""Emergency Fund"" but I am fairly secure in my job: Have been here for 1.5yrs, received a raise after my performance review, boss loves me, financially stable institution with no lay-offs. I am also single with no children, so much of my disposable income goes purely to food / going out. 

Also, after rent and bills, I normally have about $1500 per month left over each month.

**My Question**: I want to pay off my student loans sooner rather than later, but am a bit unsure what order to pay them in.

I take home a little over $3,000 a month, my brothers rent two rooms in my house for an additional $800 a month (I'm kicking them out in a couple years when they're done with college). 


I'm making minimum payments on everything, federal loans are on the lowest possible payment plan that doesn't even cover the interest because I qualify for a public service tax-free forgiveness program after 10 years (I just finished up my probation period last week, so I'm past the one year mark and therefore my job security is now very, very high). Paying $1000+ on my private loans per month, the highest interest one first, those will be gone in about a year. That's a $1000+ that will be freed up to make up for the $800 lost when the brothers move out.


Recently (last night), I totaled my debt up and kinda of just sat in wonder--how did this happen? I knew it was all there the whole time, but I never looked at it as a whole.


I got two degrees and a nice paying (for a 25 year old in my area) job with great benefits that I like with that $80k of student loan debt. I love my house in a nice neighborhood and my impractical, overkill car. At the same time I was kept up at night just wondering at that figure, then realized that no matter how much I fret about, in the end I just fail to care. I know the interest I'm going to pay on the house in particular is frightening. I know there's a slim chance that forgiveness program might get swept out from beneath my feet in the next decade (because, you know, congress). I know $400 a month is too much for entertainment expenses, that a $200 grocery bill for one person is ridiculous--but these are the things that make life worth living. They make the 7 year slog through college worth it. 

In the end, I can't take another decade of living like a pauper to save umpteen thousands in interest and prepare for the what ifs. if my math is correct (and it usually is), I could knock out the majority of that debt in the next 10 years, but there goes the last remaining bit of the best years of my life paying off debt. This is unthinkable to me.

I was so burnt out after my masters, I just want to live comfortably. Am I the only one that feels this way? As much as I hate to ask, what are the risks here? I come here for a slap of reality so bring it on. How bad is this situation? Or isn't it?",finance,1412877117

Since I have a consolidation loan, is IBR eligibility still determined based on a 10 year payment, or would it be 20 years because that is standard for consolidation? 

Do I have to requalify for IBR every year? If so, does that put the PSLF in jeopardy if I suddenly don't qualify one year? I'm scared of that happening and being on the hook for all the extra interest accrued. I plan on income going up and remaining single w/ no dependents.

There aren't many jobs available around here, either, and I'd much rather try for a full time position with the company I'm working for, as I've had my fair share of being unemployed and this company is the first I've had that actually cares for it's lowbie employees.

My husband is in the Navy, and he pays most of our bills. My job covers ""my bills"" and not much else. I'm trying to establish something more than just paying the minimum on everything, because that really doesn't get us anywhere. Is it better to pay off our smaller bills first, or the larger ones with higher interest rates? Should we be paying the minimum on everything but the specific bill we are trying to wipe, to wipe it quicker?

It's just so frustrating to be paying bills down and seeing the balance only go down by ~$20-30 a month, if that...",finance,1412885657

personalfinance,Loan interest and tax deductions,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I graduated this past May and I'm beginning to pay back student loans now (I know there is no shortage of these threads right now) and I'm looking for any input someone might have for me. I have a good job and my loans are relatively small compared to others that I see around here - about $12,600 I need to pay off, all of it federal Stafford loans.

Basically, my situation is deciding how aggressively to pay the debt back. I can afford to pay up to $600 per month, but if I did that then after all my other bills + retirement contribution and 10% personal savings, I would only be left with a little under $400 in disposable income.

I have read that interest on student loans can be deducted from taxes but I'm not sure about the small details of that fact. I can extend student loan payments to 10 years and reduce the monthly payment to somewhere around $130 per month, leaving me with much more to save/spend/invest/do whatever I want with, which is very enticing. If it is true that I can get back every penny of the extra interest that would build up in the form of tax returns, I see no reason why I shouldn't do that as it will cost the same amount long term (sorry if this is wrong, I'm not familiar with taxes yet). After all, those extra hundreds of dollars every month are worth more right now than they will be several years down the road.

So, should I stretch out the payments and take advantage of the tax deductions? Or should I go ahead and start making big payments now since I will be able to afford to do so? If I'm misunderstanding the tax system on the interest, can someone explain it to me?",finance,1412886764
personalfinance,Balance transfers- any catch?,"I have two credit cards, both with about 2K on them that I'm chipping away at. My Discover has a lower interest rate (and I just negotiated it even lower since I've been with them for a while). My BoA just starting accruing interest since I just finished my first year.

When I log into my Discover account, I see an option to do a balance transfer: 0% APR for 18 months, and $0 fee. 

Are there any concerns with doing a balance transfer? I've never done it before. Does it affect credit, can lender see it (and do they think negatively of them), or is it just me consolidating my credit, at the lower interest rate, making my payments easier.

I know that it will mean I'm using a greater portion of my credit line (and that will affect credit score) but is there anything else?

Also, I set aside the same amount each month to pay off cards, so I wouldn't screw myself over by not paying off as much or being misled about my debt amount or anything!

personalfinance,"26 with a lot of debt, help!","I've seen a lot of similar situations as I've been a lurker... but I will post my story and hopefully someone can help. I will give as many specific details as I can! 

Basically I was a bit stupid in college and since the school I went to (4 year school) didn't have on-campus housing they advised us to take out extra loans to help with an apartment. I worked through most of college to pay for my car (which I paid off early, woo!) but art school is expensive and I had to use loans and credit cards to pay for supplies. 

Here is my breakdown. My job pays okay, my monthly take-home is $1,860. The problem is our benefits are terrible so I cannot afford insurance. I make too much to get a lot of help from the Affordable Care Act so I am currently searching for ways to afford health insurance. My job does not contribute/match a 401k and I am scraping by so I don't contribute. This is the other issue, I would really like to find a way to pay down some debts so I can start putting something into retirement AND have a savings account again. 

Again, take-home is $1,860

Monthly Expenses:

• Mortgage $340 - ($66k left, 3.65% I got super lucky)

• Private Student Loans $470 (around $60k, various interest rates from 
   4-6%) 

• Stafford Loans - $175 (about $20k, various interest rates from 4-6%)

• Gasoline - $160-180 (I commute about 50 miles a day for work)

• Car Insurance - $75

• Credit Cards - $210 - ( $3,200 total debt. this is bad, I know. I've 
   been attacking this first. I pay off any home repairs on a home 
   improvement store card at the end of each month and then pay as 
   much extra on the card I had for college, but I  never pay the  minimum on any of my 3 cards. None of my cards 
   are even close to being maxed out and are for emergencies only.)

• Entertainment (Netflix, Spotify) - $18

• Internet/Cable - $55

• W/S/T - $40 (these are paid quarterly but I put money aside each 
   month)

• Gas/Electric - $50-75

• Cell Phone - $45

• Groceries - $75-100

Expenses are around $1,700 + depending on groceries. 

I make a little extra money here and there through freelance work but it's not steady and typically comes in waves. I usually use that money as an additional payment to something. I have no savings account to speak of and while I currently don't have a car payment, it would be nice to have money set aside in case something needs fixed (car OR home). I don't go out often and if I do, I only allow myself to spend $5-10. 

What are my options? Am I totally screwed?",finance,1412888288
Bitcoin,US Commodities futures trading commission partial transcript.,"--is to look at the peer it is connecting to and see are they following the same rules I am? If not, it is rejected. If they are following the same rules, you can join Bitcoin in that fashion. 

 Two questions. The first is how do you know there is no fraud or backdoors built in to the initial code? And then the second is if all the goodie is coming from the block chain, why not just put dollars on the block chain? 

Good question. 
So how do you know that there isn't some secret back? 
You know -- so I presume that many of what we are using her today, the TVs and the projector run on open s ource, they run on Linux. 

So how do we know there is not a backdoor? The answer is all open source by definition is open and public to scrutiny and review by anybody who wants to look at it. 
So there are a couple of ways to do this. 
And a trust list manner, you can download the source code yourself self, review it, and verify for yourself that there are no backdoors. 

I am not a computer programmer, so I have to trust some of the worlds foremost cryptographers who have looked at it and have given if the thumbs up. 
But essentially, it is open and verifiable to anybody. 
So that is how -- it is actually probably, I trust it more than I would trust a proprietary software system where you have to trust the company. 
That is my position. Your second question is why not dollars? 
I was sort of turn it around and say how would you do that with dollars? You could imagine -- so you have to have a token that can be transferred between two different parties. That token, we call it a Bitcoin. 
Because there is a limited amount of them, the value floats. 
It is relative to the dollar. 
You can imagine the US government tagging the dollar to the Bitcoin. 
I doubt that will happen. 
That is how you would accomplish it, but there is no technical way really that you could technically put it to the dollar without a third-party guaranteeing that. 


I think it is an excellent question and I think it is possible and we have a live example of Ecuador starting to do that now. 
So they actually want to tie their national currency using the Bitcoin protocol and the validation system and as you may know, the Federal Reserve is looking to modernize their financial system, ACH, fed wire and I think it could be very feasible. 
I see it as, just like Bitcoin itself, we are in the experiment of. 
The Fed is due a small experience, tie a few US treasuries to the protocol, tie it as a U.S. Treasury and let that be exchanged and validated. 
Because the core of the Bitcoins is really just a validation system. 
The real power of the Bitcoins is to say that I no longer have that one Bitcoins. I sent it to you and now you have it and all the miners are putting their power -- and it is actually not a peer to peer -- I think it is a competitive peer mining ecosystem. 
They are all trying to first calculate the winning formula or output so that they can get the 25 Bitcoins reward. 
There are a lot of losing miners out there that spend a lot of expensive electricity, but they don't win that reward and they hurry up and tried to win the next reward. 
So as some are unsuccessful, they are going to drop out. 
Summer going to be more successful because they have more computing power. 
May they set up shop in Seattle where the electricity is cheaper. 
You know it is a very open market. 
But I think your question is a possible future use of Bitcoin. 


I think I was just asking -- it seems to me like it is just a distributed ledger that this intermediates. 
If you can have a token that represents a Bitcoin, could you have a token that represents a dollar on yet a separate block chain. 


And that is what Ecuador is doing. 


But it sounded to me like they were tying it to the Bitcoin. That I missed that? 


No. 


It is a separate block chain? 


Yes. It is a separate copied or mimicked Bitcoin protocol because it is a free source. It is a free open source code out there. 


David? 


So the material we were reading, it talks about the market either being unregulated or subject to existing regulation. 
Where do you see this between those two? And what are the differences between the American perspective and that of Europe or are there any differences? I think there is a misconception that Bitcoin is unregulated. I think since it's invention, since they won, it is subject to existing Money transmission regulations and other consumer protection or. 
So it is definitely regulated in many different ways. 
I could go into detail about my transmission if you would like me to. But I will not. 
These other countries, it varies. 
There are some countries that are friendlier and some countries that are more hostile. 
So take for example, Russia. It seems to be, have a law proceeding through its processes that might make it illegal. 
And I think it is largely the cause they are concerned about the capital controls. 
You need to have other things such as -- Amsterdam -- it has been especially from the. 
The UK recently, they announced that he wants the UK in London to be the capital of Bitcoin finance and he wants to initiate a proceeding on how to figure out how to open up that regulatory space there. 
So there seems to be a bit of competition right now to attract that investment and to attract that innovation. 


I also think for a regulatory perspective, you have to think about different US, or whatever countries, regulators, from their own perspective or wheelhouse, things they are concerned about in particular. 
Maybe the consumer finance protection Bureau, which deals with consumer issues and the securities and exchange Commission will think about other issues. 
From the FCC perspective, whether you raise capital with dollars or dog biscuits or Bitcoin, you still have to abide by securities regulation. 
And we have seen a couple of relatively prominent fraud and Ponzi scheme that happened with Bitcoin. 
Coming back to this commission here, I think that Bitcoin is regulated by and could still achieve the policy objectives while fostering really important innovation in the marketplace through contract structure and market structure as well. 
I think on some level that regulators need to let Bitcoin developers put their money where their mouth i s. 
And say if there is a system that can sort of revolutionize or up in finance this by making it decentralized and cheaper and so forth and faster, you should try it and see what sort of policy objectives in terms of consumer and investor protection and market protection you can achieve as well. 


Just one more point on that. 
The question to regulate or not, usually with regard to underlined activity. 
To regulate Bitcoin is like regulating the Internet. 
It is what you do on the Internet or how you use that, money transfer, by an asset, e-commerce or otherwise. 
You don't just regulate the Internet, no one does and the Internet is a protocol. Most people don't know that. But it is TCP/IP, Internet protocol. Nobody in the room really cares about analyzing what the protocol is or who wrote it or otherwise, but it has long existed, originally developed with government research money, and it is used reliably for very long time. 
Bitcoin is another protocol. 
What would you regulate? The activity using the protocol called Bitcoin and if it is for money transfer, then okay. If it is for swaps, that is the regulation that the FCC uses as an index. If it has a Bitcoin asset beneath it. 
You cannot say regulate Bitcoin so much as you can say regulate activity that touches, utilizes, or otherwise, involves the use of that protocol. 


From the perspective of this regulator, to what extent would markets and swaps for Bitcoin be susceptible to me relation? 


So with regard to what we have established in the filing that we presented to the CF CT, we built a a swap. And the swap relies on an index, a series of underlined markets. 
The underlined markets could potentially be susceptible to manipulation and what we had to establish with the staff and ultimately our self certification is that the numbers we are pulling from these various exchanges will ultimately be curated, filtered, take out anonymous behavior to prevent somebody from essentially attempting to manipulate, either meeting the requirement that is not susceptible for many relation and two levels. 
First is our market susceptible? Every participation is marketed and we have our own surveillance and we also have the surveillance of the NSA to back us up with regard to market participants. 
He also surveilled the underlined market that feed into the index and as I mentioned before we had information sharing agreements with each market so the location we pull data from provides us access to individual traders if necessary, positions they may hold to determine whether there is going to be manipulation. 
As a matter of fact,, the changes, the exchanges we use are proud of the fact they are following KYC and what robust market places to address the very question you are asking, which is is there many relation happening? They want a sound marketplace and they are achieving it in their marketplaces and we can take the data and build the swaps off of that. 


So you have these information sharing agreements between the TeraExchange, the cash markets, and the SEF's? Correct. 


Okay. But what other functions, surveillance functions do you use? You're getting a right of access of some sort, but otherwise, how are you surveilling these individual cash markets around the globe? 


We use surveillance by pulling the feed and watching surveillance on the feed, watch the price action and when we find the behavior, it is filtered in the index automatically props up on call for us to make an inquiry. 
During the analysis for between March and when we ultimately filed, there was activity on what in the exchanges. 
For example, it essentially look like someone could essentially be doing something. It triggered flags on our system to advise us to look out, look at this behavior which we did. 
We made the phone call, spoke to the technology personnel and also spoke to the underlying controllers of the account. They said no. We know these players. There is nobody moving the market. There is no lost to trade. 
We have that information at our disposal, so we can constantly monitor it. 


Anything else? 


I think that is going to bring the meeting to a close. We have gone over time. 
Thank you again very, very much. Just one last point I would like to make on Bitcoin. 
Obviously, there is relevancy here in taking up this topic today in light of TeraExchange filing. 
As I mentioned before we expect that we are going to receive other filings from other platforms as well in the very, very near future. 
I was interested to hear in some, some of the remarks by the professor about these applications that could be made at this technology in a way that is actually useful to our space, the derivatives space. 
And it just seems like based on what I have learned, some of those applications could be so compelling that it would be a real mistake for us as a commission to not make sure we are staying on top of these development's. 
Not, because we want to do anything other than understand the developments because it seems like this protocol, the Bitcoin protocol or something like it is very, very likely here to stay. 
So the more information and education we can do on this now in trying to stay somewhere on the appropriate spot of the learning curve, it seems to be a very sensible thing to do. 
So I think that it has been very, very helpful and thank you for representing the CFCT staff and I will turn it back over now. 


I think we are good. I want to thank everybody for coming. I want to give a special thanks to the staff and her team that does all the work going on behind the scenes.

Bitcoin,"Do the Libertarian ideals behind Bitcoin help or hinder? A case for the pro-Libertarian side of the argument, and why Bitcoin will succeed because of it:","The anti-fiat, ""be your own bank"", ""take the power back, man"" excitement that exists on this sub usually gets poo-poo'ed and downvoted a bit.  I think a lot of people believe that its the blockchain technology that will bring the most change to the world, rather than widespread use of Bitcoin as a currency.  

However, Satoshi must be somewhat of a Libertarian, because he invented Bitcoin to be an alternative to fiat itself.  Bitcoin is completely self contained.  He did this in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and I'm assumming he did so out of being fed up with the dollar.  Because *he* saw the writing on the wall.

I wouldn't worry about the recent price volatility.  The price goes up and down, in the end, entirely due to supply and demand.  Right now, if you're a serious trader and you want to make some money, you're putting your money in the stock market.  Alibaba, anyone?  The US Dollar is doing great.  Of course people are throwing their money into the stock market instead of Bitcoin.  

So the incentive, and the original purpose of Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat (mainly the dollar standard) has faded somewhat recently.  Face it, the world doesn't need Bitcoin if the dollar is strong.  I sure don't.

Bitcoin is continuously touted as an experiment.  ""The Bitcoin Experiment"" this, ""The Bitcoin Experiment"" that, blah blah blah.  In reality, there are TWO experiements going on.  Both of which have uncertain outcomes.  The first is Bitcoin.  The second is the dollar, and Keynesian economics itself.  Whether our global economy can last being a debt based, consumer driven, by-now-pay-later, print more money, print even more money, and print some more money!  All while being backed *entirely by faith.*  

If there is anything we can learn by the recent price crash(es) it is that people are fickle.  They will chase The Almighty Profit to the end, whether that profit is in Bitcoin or fiat.  And they will move their money in and out in an instant.  So while the dollar is strong now, it might not be a month from now, or even a week from now.  Look at the correlation between the recent drop in the stock market and the small price recovery in Bitcoin ($357 USD as I write this).  Does correlation equal causation?  Perhaps.

So which experiment do you guys back?  That of the US Dollar?  Or Bitcoin?  Which one is a better way to store your wealth, 1 year, 10 years, 20 years from now?  I for one, am voting Bitcoin.  The Dollar will die before Bitcoin does.  Grab your popcorn and watch.  The Libertarian roots of Bitcoin may be the one thing that will allow it to be adopted.",cryptocurrency,1412891326

My background:

My family grew up very poverty stricken. No savings, no college fund, no help expected or wanted from my family. Because of this, I paid for five years of schooling with loans and a part time job. I got a lot of grants throughout school, and some early scholarships that helped from high school.

Needless to say, money during school went towards bills (I used the loans to pay rent/school only). I left school with no savings and ~35k in debt.


My Wife:

Her family was bit more well off. My wife only took loans for the extra money, but her parents plan on paying everything off and don't expect us to pay any of her loans and all. They're stubborn and won't let us help even if we tried. I'm not sure if the loans were parent PLUS loans, but I would assume that they are.

She left college with no debt, and ~$2100 in savings.


Luckily, we both got decent starting jobs and are working full time.

personalfinance,Transferring to a bigger university. Need help deciding the smartest way to afford it.,"I've been attending a community college for 2 1/2 years. I have a 4.0 GPA and was accepted to a large university for the spring semester. Very happy about this! I applied for this one specifically because it had a smaller tuition cost, and was still very respected in my degree (accounting). I plan on getting my masters and cpa license when I finish up my bachelors.


So here's the run down:

I've taken out about 25k in student loans so far (all federal). I have been working (a little) on the side to cover the rest of my bills.

I live frugally. No cable, no cell phone, no social life to speak of. No home phone bill, thanks to google voice.

No credit card debt.

I have a car loan with 3.5k left. I plan on paying this off in 6 months from a new seasonal job I've been doing (job might dry up around then.. if not then savings for the next semester so I can take out less loans).

I owe the IRS $500 - same as car as far as repayment.


So far, this has worked out. I know it's better to graduate with no debt, but with no savings for college, and no parents to help me (I'm older), this was my only option to get out of a very shitty dead end life style. Plus, I'm a good student and love my degree choice.


Now... The new college. As I mentioned, the tuition is very affordable. About a 30% increase to what I have now. However, the rent around the college is much higher, and I know there will be other fees tacked on from the school that I don't currently have.


This is going to strain my budget, and I might need to take out some more loans... maybe 5k more per year, on top of what I have. (so, around 15k per year total).


I haven't applied for scholarships or grants yet, but I will. This is all kind of happening this month - getting everything for me transferred over.


I guess I'm just looking for advice, on what I should and shouldn't do in the future. Is 50-60k too much debt for my degree choice? I'm going to try to take as many classes as I can handle (without hurting my grades), go during summer, and possibly CLEP out of a few requirements I missed at my old college...

Bitcoin,A Long-Term Hodler Perspective on Bitcoin (x-post from /r/BitcoinMarkets),"**A Long-Term Hodler Perspective on Bitcoin**

I'm a bit of a financial conservative and along with many of you, I have been growing increasingly concerned by the direction of both US and EU monetary policy over the last decade. Our Federal Reserve system, while advantageous to the economy in many ways, can also create significant problems through its virtually unlimited power to issue currency. Since late 2008, the Federal Reserve began to use this power to buy US treasury bills, mortgage-backed securities and bank debt at an unprecedented rate and now owns $4.4 trillion of this kind of debt. Think about that number of a second -- that's 4 thousand billion. It's a number that's almost incomprehensible. And the Fed has taken on this debt at rates never before seen in the history of this country. This ""unconventional monetary policy"" is called [""Quantitative Easing,"" which is a euphemism for the fact that the Fed is printing money and stuffing it into the pockets of the Federal Government and US banks.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing#US_QE1.2C_QE2.2C_and_QE3) 

This stimulates the economy and may have shortened the recession. However, the QE program, along with rock-bottom interest rates, is also essentially propping up the economy artificially.[ It was never intended to be permanent, but it is quickly becoming so. By its very nature, QE is addictive.](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101144335#) Essentially, if the Fed were to remove its QE program the market would respond negatively. [See, for example, the joy about this week's ""stay the course"" Fed meeting.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/10/08/stocks-wednesday/16900165/) Last month the Fed already promised to fully end QE. [And yet here we are, wondering WTF the monetary policy of the largest economy in the world actually is.]( http://finance.yahoo.com/news/schiff--get-ready-for-qe-infinity-144200323.html) 

My take is that, despite its comments to the contrary, the Fed simply can't stop money printing in the form of QE. Their actions have made that abundantly clear. They are ""tapering"" or even promising to fully end QE, but even if they nominally do so, they will be forced to adopt QE-like policies or other potent ways of suppressing interest rates. It is simply too politically costly for them to cut QE and see the markets tank. (Even though their current highs are artificially sustained.) Yes, the dollar is strong right now, and yes, inflation appears to be low for the moment, but any kind of common sense would dictate that creating tens of billion a month out of thin air and dumping it into the economy can't be sustainable forever and it WILL have repercussions eventually. [Any student of history should be able to name a few classic examples of this policy in action.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic#Hyperinflation) 

This should be especially troubling to anyone who read the recent news that,[ with the German economy on the verge of recession, the European Central Bank will soon be embarking on it's own QE program.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2014/09/08/draghis-case-for-ecb-quantitative-easing/) The bottom line is that two of the world's largest currencies may both soon be locked into a never-ending cycle of QE.

[Other economies, including Japan, are embarking on QE programs so ambitious they will eventually double the total money supply.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/04/japan-quantitative-easing-70bn) 

All of which brings me to Bitcoin.[ If you listened to Andreas' comments to the Canadian Senate yesterday,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNGFZDO8mM) you would have heard him discuss the advantages of ""programmable money"" that has its own hardwired monetary policy.[ Bitcoin is currently inflationary -- greatly so -- and this was part of its design. We are only in the 2nd of 34 ""block reward eras.""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply) If you consult the table in the above link, you will see that Bitcoin doesn't become deflationary, or nearly so, until 2028, when over 98% of all BTC have been mined and released to the market. Or, to put it another way, the ""endgame"" monetary policy of this particular ""programmable money"" doesn't truly go into effect for another decade.

At which point, we will have two financial instruments to choose from. One which is locked into a cycle of constant inflation, the US dollar, the Euro, etc. And one which is fixed and deflationary. The latter has never existed before in human history. Even the Roman Emperors could mine silver and mint coins with enough slave labor. Central banking made this process trivial. With Bitcoin, the rate of issuance will slow to a trickle by the mid-2020s, and will eventually end completely. This is not a promise from a central bank, it is a fact -- immutably determined by code and enforced by a distributed network. 

The reason I visit this sub is that the economics of this process, the slow but inevitable creation of a deflationary monetary system, are a social science and economics experiment on a scale unknown in human history. Assuming we don't suffer a zombie apocalypse or a meteor strike, Bitcoin will be here in 2028, at whatever price the market determines, with 98.4% of its potential currency issued. The US dollar will also be here in 2028 at, in a best case scenario, a regular 3% inflation rate. Our over-reliance on QE as monetary policy may worsen this and, in addition, may weaken the economy in the long term as the viciously addictive QE programs are further propped up with the inevitable federal initiatives aimed at trying to sustain them.

[Even according to the government's official \(and rosy\) statistics, $100 you were paid in 2000 is only worth $72 today.](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) It will be one of the most interesting developments of our time to see how a deflationary system will function alongside and compete with, a system reliant on ""QE-Infinity,"" as the program has now been named. 

Remember the prophetic message coded into the Genesis Block: 

    ""the Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""

And all that is why, if you can see the writing on the wall, you should buy a Bitcoin, put it in a paper wallet, and not touch it for at least a decade. Because the seeds sown now, both in cryptos and in the US financial system, won't quite be ripe until the mid-2020s, but when the time comes...it's gonna be interesting.

personalfinance,Credit Card vs Personal Loans vs Student Loans for tuition,"I'm planning on going back to school in Spring 2015. I'm going to start slow and just take a couple classes at first to ease into it, but after that I plan on going full time. I'm going to one of the cheapest community colleges in my state for the first two years but the price tag still seems overwhelming at $200/credit+books, a bus pass and other supplies. 

In a perfect world I'd have my EFC of $9,300 saved up, ready to go for school but alas, that is not the case. 

I'll be 24 in 2015 so FAFSA is my first step and I plan on maxing out any subsidized loans I get. After that, I'm hoping I can finagle enough money together to pay the rest cash, but that might start to get unrealistic after a couple of semesters. At that point I'll be in the market for other loans. 

If I can max out unsubsidized Stafford loans, that should cover the vast majority of my tuition. However, I have pretty decent credit (FAKO via CK is at 733 right now, six years of history and 100% on time payments) and was wondering if I should at least try for private student loans or personal loans to see if the interest rate would be more favorable than the unsubsidized Stafford. My parents are also crazy, and willing to cosign for me if that would decrease interest rates at all. 

Another thought I had shooting around was to try to play the balance transfer game with credit cards for at least some of the cost. Use credit cards for the gap between the subsidized loans and the rest of the tuition bill, transfer to 0% promo cards, and pay it off with the American Opportunity Credit tax refund (at least $2000, up to $2500). The problem with this is I can't control how high my limit will be on the balance transfer card, so I could end up with some debt at 12.9%. 

I hope the FAFSA fairy brings me good news this year (here, have this free money! I won't qualify for Pell Grants but I *might* qualify for state grants) but I'm not counting on anything more than subsidized loans.

Finished grad school in May and recently started my new career. While in grad school, I was fortunate to get a research position that paid for a good portion of my tuition/books but I still ended up taking out around 20K in loans. 

As a graduation present, I got about 7K from family members that I've been using to pay rent and so forth until I started my job. Now that I've started my job, I want to pay off a chunk of my loans and then start making frequent payments until it's paid off. As of today, I have about $9500 in the bank.

-unsubsidized loans: ~$14,400 (~2K is from interest)

-grace period for sub loans ends this November

personalfinance,For-Profit Schools: My Personal Experience with Strayer,"A friend suggested I post this to Reddit after I posted it on Facebook. It's up on Strayer's page as a review. Liking, sharing, and commenting would be awesome and helpful.


I need to come out and tell my story about Strayer University. Hopefully, it will help others make more informed decisions, and maybe, it'll shed a little more light on their shady practices. 


In the summer of 2011, I walked into the Woodbridge campus of Strayer looking for some information on taking a few classes to help round out my application to a master's program.  I had no intention of seeking a degree and was transparent about my goals. Within a few minutes, I had been sat down by an 'enrollment counselor' and 'accepted' to Strayer. I was told financial aid would cover everything and that they'd even help me do the application there! Looking at the classes and prices, I could get the few I wanted and potentially a certification for a few thousand dollars. What I was sold was definitely within my means. I signed the paper.


Strayer's employees helped me onsite to file for financial aid, advising me how to answer certain questions to get the maximum amount. I was assured claiming to be a degree-seeking student was the correct choice even though I made it very clear to them I was not. I followed their instructions.


After three semesters, I withdrew and made sure to pay any balances. About a year after I left Strayer, I received a letter saying that I owed them over $4,000. Confused, I called in trying to rectify the error. I spent weeks on and off the phone with different offices trying to get an explanation for the charge. Eventually, I gave up and decided to just make monthly payments as one of the many contacts had suggested. I sent in the form requesting a monthly payment agreement to the Woodbridge campus and received no response. I figured the error had finally worked itself out.


Over a year later in September 2014, I received another letter from Strayer saying I still owed the roughly $4000. I called, and after being juggled from one office to another to being put on hold indefinitely, I was directed by the campus director to email a formal letter of dispute. Having dealt with formal business letters in the past, I thought it was strange to issue a formal statement through email and to a shared campus email address, not a personal case or account manager. I sent the email and also sent a copy via certified mail requesting a response in writing. I received no response or even acknowledgement of receipt.


About a week later, I got another automated email saying I was past due and threatening escalation to collections if I hadn't responded within 10 days. I called in and said I had submitted in writing, in duplicate, formal disputes of the charge. The person on the phone agreed to look into what had actually incurred the charge and call me back. When she did return the call, she had found that the charge had resulted from my age. When I had originally applied for federal financial aid to fund Strayer, I was 23. At that time, no one told me I would be considered a dependent regardless of my financial and living situations. A dependent student isn't eligible for as much funding, so my disbursement was recalled. Now, I'm paying them $360/month until it's paid off.

Why did it take so long for someone to research it and explain it? Why did it take so long for them to contact me? Why was I misled about the costs and coverages of taking classes there?

Who knows. All I know is that I want people to see how for-profit schools operate and how shady they really are. (edited for formatting clarity)",finance,1412958569
personalfinance,"I have $25k in cash from selling a business, $83k in student loan debt. Looking for perspective.","Hi everyone!

This is kind of a standard question, but I wanted to throw it out anyway. My apologies if this is too vanilla for this sub.

Just a quick story on my background. I started a company a couple years ago which ended up growing and becoming successful. I traded my equity in the tiny company for equity in a new company, and ended up coming out of it with around $25k in cash (maybe a bit more, depending on taxes). It's the most cash I've had on hand, ever. Before this adventure I was living on $10k/year in graduate school. Most of this cash represents salary I didn't take for myself as I was growing the company and living off of my wife's income for the past 2 years. 

I have $83k in student loan debt. It's grown over the years, mostly because I focused on grad school and then building my business. I absolutely loathe my debt, but refused to have it dictate my ability to build a company. No risk, no reward etc. I've never really addressed it, usually making minimum payments so I could route my income back into my business. Or telling the loan companies I was still in school (which was true to an extent) so I could keep it on forbearance. Currently it breaks down to: $19k @ 3%, $21k @ 3.25% (both of these are private loans). $32k @ 4.5%, $11k @ 6.8%.

The private loans have no flexibility (they really are bastards) but they do have the lowest interest rate. The federal loan people are super friendly, flexible, and let me adjust the payments without limit, to some extent. I prefer lower payments and saving on my own (to make higher payments quarterly), than higher minimum payments that reduce flexibility. I currently pay $650/mo, but that's with the first federal loan on an extended graduated payment, basically interest only. Ideally I should be paying $1k/mo (and am planning on doing that starting this fall) for the next 10 years.

Today I have a salary with the new company, making $75k/yr, and my wife makes $30k. Our net income per month is about $6k/mo. It's the first time we have a stable income between the two of us. I also have equity in the new company, and expect to receive owner distributions sometime in the next 3 years. If we continue to grow, it's possible that my new company could be spinning off anywhere from $5k-$100k/year for me. But that's not certain, and we could just as easily go bankrupt. Point being, I'm not planning on it.

I do not currently have much savings, but I'm also not too worried about it. No kids, plenty of earning potential, and I have a small IRA that is doing well. I do not consider putting this cash in savings as an option (edit: ya'll have made me change my mind), because I may as well just pay off debt and divert the difference in payments to savings each month. That's also kind of boring.

So the way I see it, I have the following options:

1. Take the lump sum, throw it at the student loans. Ideally knocking out one of them entirely, reducing the minimum payments. I'll still have a crap ton left, and still be paying out the ass for the next decade, although it will make me sleep better at night knowing the balance is less and I've done my proper civic duties in paying back a partial obligation to the american financial system (ugh). This makes me kind of sad, too, because it's kind of like the money I earned basically is gone to the black hole of debt. But I'm OK with that. If I go this route -- which should I pay off first? I'm thinking private loans since they have the worst flexibility, but I could also see the argument for paying off the higher interest rate federal loans. Unfortunately if loan forgiveness ever comes into play, that only affects federal loans. So maybe that's important to remember. 

2. Take the lump sum, invest it into a new side business. I have several ideas, and have the technical ability to pull them off (i'm a developer). But of course they could fail, and I'm back to square one. I could also invest into one of the burgeoning startups in my city, who would love even $5k to get bootstrapped.

3. Take the lump sum, invest it into a dividend growth portfolio. I have been successful with this in the past (enough to know what I'm doing). It would allow me to spin off a small amount each quarter to then pay back into the loans, but it wouldn't be much. Let's call it 5%, or roughly $1200/year. I'm assuming interest paid on student loans will cancel out interest owed in the income. A benefit of this is that in 20 years I'd have put, say, $25k towards the loans and would still have the original balance (hopefully more) remaining. It's also possible that this idea is really stupid.

4. Use it towards some other investment, like buying our first home or buying a condo to rent out. The local economy is growing quickly, and we currently rent a condo. $25k would be a nice down payment, and the mortgage on a $140k home would be less than we're currently paying for rent ($900/mo). I also recognize that the cost of ownership would likely be higher overall, so this wouldn't necessarily be a money saver.

5. Something else entirely! Let's assume I don't have any debt at all (or I can pay it down with my salary). What would you do?

To be honest, I'm leaning towards just throwing it all at the student loans and being done with it. It just makes me kind of sad. I am proud of the accomplishment (which is small in the scheme of businessy things, but my first taste of this world), and I now have that ""bug"" where I just want to keep building. You can't do that without cash. But unfortunately, at some point I need to do the responsible thing and take care of my own debt. At the same time, what's another $10k in capitalized interest if I'm able to build another company that is even better than the first one?

I'm just looking for perspective. (Oh -- and to the answer ""how did you end up with so much debt in the first place?"" -- it was an unfortunate combination of ignorance, poor planning, and timing).

Other information that might be helpful in making this decision:
- I currently have healthcare through the expanded medicaid package at no cost
- I live in Louisville, KY: State tax of 5.8% on income between $8001 - $75,000 (I cannot find valid information on city taxes)
- I will file as a single, independent worker

Furthermore, I have considered asking for an hourly rate. I cannot afford to work more than 40 hours without significant compensation. Is it normal/acceptable to ask for, say, $21 an hour for this type of position?

Got my first credit card two months ago, and have been paying in full and on time. Yay. My utilization is about 50% since I have a low entry limit. I've applied for a second card to try and spread the love around. My score is good, but on the low side due to lack of accounts/age. Expected.

I have (federal) student loans that are less than $2K. These aren't showing up for me, but did show up for my friend who is in the same year as me. I'm not so silly as to assume I have none. Is there a certain point when they pop up?

To add to that, I owe about $2K for this semester. I have the savings to pay my school in full but it'll cut into a good chunk of that. I've never had so much money of my own before and I like to see it sitting around in my accounts, but this is something I can live with. Alternatively, should I take out more loans to pay off the balance to my school, so I have more to ""good debt"" to pay off when I've graduated? These would still be federal. When I got my first loan, my FinAid advisor said I can expect monthly payments of ~$50/month which I'm sure I'd be able to contribute way more to.

personalfinance,Young high(ish) income couple - making the right choices?,"Hi PF,

Looking for some general advice:

Wife and I are both 29.

I make ~$130k/yr in a technical field. I suspect I am a little over-credentialed, and may have a hard time quickly finding a new job, if something were to happen to this job. But I’m happy, don’t think I’m getting fired anytime soon, etc. Things are good.

My wife is a medical student, in a program that pays her tuition and a small living stipend ($30k/yr).


Neither of us have any debt.


We own 2 newer cars, and a house. We’ve been paying down the mortgage (4% interest rate) early, and presently owe about $75k (on a $225k property). We plan on totally paying off the house in the next few years.

I contribute 3% to my company 401(k), in order to get the full matching benefit. Presently have $25k in there.

We have ~$30k in liquid savings, and could easily live off that for 12+ months. We would have access to some other money, as well, in an emergency.

Should we be doing anything differently? My concern is that while we’re certainly doing pretty well, now, we will be doing better in the future when wife completes medical school and begins practicing in her specialization (we’re expecting she will be making ~$200-400k, ~7 years from now). Thus, I’m not yet too concerned about putting away retirement savings. 

We also have no plans for kids. So, my thoughts lean towards “Spend more / enjoy life / hire a housekeeper / take more vacations / etc”, but I’d like some confirmation/feedback.

**In the beginning**

The basic method humans used to interact with one another before the widespread use of money was social credit. This is best understood when you're out with your  friends and you purchase something for one of them because they can't afford it right now. Do you set terms and conditions on the repayment like a bank does? Of course not, neither would you charge interest. In fact, you might not even care that much when it's paid back, since you're certain they will do at some point. Moreover, it may be the situation that you bought something for your friend for $10, but you don't expect them to pay you back exactly $10 or something else of the same value. You may accept that same friend just buying lunch or two small lunches and call the debt paid. If you can't imagine doing this with a person, then that person most likely is not your good friend. It really has to be someone you can trust.



And before the advent of coinage, which is as much a social revolution as a technological one, we lived in small villages and towns. In these circumstances, most people would have known each other, and trusted one another enough to use social credit/debt with one another. You might know the same 50 people your whole life, and this can be seen as basically an extended group of friends. You didn't need physical tokens in such an atmosphere, as everything was basically stored as a virtual 'ledger' that everyone held in their heads that was essentially a snapshot of the economy in that town/village. The economy existed in our heads. This by the way, is how we can think of Central Banks today; they are the virtual ledger for our entire economy, it's just an external representation (external to our minds) of our economy. Seeing it like this, we can see that the invention of Central Banks really isn't that revolutionary. What's important to note about this economy is that there are discrete transactions as all the interactions were simply in a flowing state, where you owed something to one person but someone could owe you something else. And the 'value' of items was particular to the people involved, their history, personality and so on. It was normal for people to be creditors and debtors to one another at the same time and there was no such thing as 'paying off your debts'. In fact, if you looked to 'pay off your debt' to someone, that would in fact mean you wanted nothing further to do with that person.



**Coinage**

This is now where bullion steps in. If you're dealing with strangers, you wouldn't use such a system since you can't vouch for the people you're dealing with. In these instances, you use coins or tokens, and those interactions with the strangers then  become a single transaction, that's settled in a single trading session. That made sense, you might never deal with those people again. But what happened as we started in live in larger settlements and where it was impossible to vouch for everyone was that we needed to use coins or tokens on a daily basis, not just with a passing stranger or similar situation. Without coins, it would have been almost impossible to live in such large centres as a cohesive group. This is where coins and the 'market' is born. With strangers we don't have time to establish a dynamic or any history with each other, and that's where now a combination of the law, bullion and 'markets' means we're all equals when it comes to transactions. Your $10 is the same as my $10, and so on. Now every interaction is a transaction and we use coins/tokens with one another. Throughout history, this just happened to be gold/silver. It's important to understand that the 'market' is not a natural state of human affairs. It's an institution we have placed over each other so that we can live in large numbers together. 


But of course given the level of technology we had (and diminishing returns), we only had so much food production and therefore the world population was relatively stable for a long time. In this situation, gold and silver are fine to use as money since population growth was quite stable or grew at a slow rate and so it was easy to provide all the gold/silver people needed to deal with one another. From Debt: The First 5000 Years, the author points out that in many occasions during the middle ages (before 1450 AD) there were shortages of coins and people simply reverted back to either using local currencies with limited circulation or just social credit/debt arrangements. This simply is not feasible anymore, we must have money to trade with one another.



**The government, surplus**

This is now where we encounter the Government. It is important in human affairs that a Government does not produce anything. It simply governs. This has two aspects to it: firstly, a policy-setter that also produced something could set policies that favoured himself; and we instinctively feel that a policy-setter who produced half the time would not be good at the former job. We recognise that we live better when we're together, but for that to work, we need a governing power in place. A governing power provides a high-level view of a region, one that it can do because the people in power are not producing anything. The governing power consumes the surplus of the private sector and in exchange, it provides security and services to society. By consuming a surplus that it did not produce, the Government gives out money, and this gives people the prospect of becoming wealthy. It also creates more extreme inequality. This is simply a by-product of having a governing power and money in play. 



**The 'market'**

There is a lot of talk about leaving the market alone, how much Government's should be involved and so on. This is a false dichotomy. There is no market without Government. It's simple as that. People always assume that the market is how people interact naturally. This is false. It's a manmade institution, that can only exist with the law, with enforcement and vigilance. 



**Bullion/Central Banks**

I think it's a false dichotomy to talk about Governments printing money and an economy relying on gold, which cannot be printed but must be dug up out of the ground. But of course it can be debased, as has happened many times during history. Bullion and central banks share one aspect in common: they are not controlled by the Government. The entire point of a central bank is that it is free from the Government, and so monetary policy is separate from politics. And it's worked. Bullion works in an environment where population is relatively stable, but with a growing population, you need someone to be in control of the money supply. You cannot have a shrinking money supply but also a growing population, as that would mean there are fewer tokens for strangers to exchange with each other. If strangers can't use money to interact with one another, they will use other means, and most are violent. It is a feature of post-apocalypse shows/games that money isn't in use, and everyone now is a stranger to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. But this is time consuming, so we often have shortcuts to deal with each other, and again, these are often violent. Right now, we may have such shortcuts in mind when dealing with a stranger, but we have money instead that we use to deal with that stranger.",finance,1413001155
economy,"My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (part 2)","**The Government, money and price**

The private sector produces goods and services that it uses amongst itself. Money that is used exclusively by the private sector would net out to 0, as one person would spend, another would save. You could have a rich person for a while, but he would have most of the money in the society and eventually would need to spend on what he needs anyway. But all transactions net out to 0. But using technology, the private sector produces a surplus. Where should that surplus go? The Government now steps in. The Government consumes some of that surplus. All it has done is give out money, it's not really 'spending' as it never had resources in the first place. It's just giving the private sector money for use of some of that surplus. But there is surplus leftover after the government has taken its share. And this is what the private sector and Government now competes for. And this final surplus, is what enables people to get sustainably wealthy. So the Government has given out money to the private sector for the initial surplus that was created. It (or more accurately, the Central Bank) now has to 'price' the final surplus. You have to ensure the private sector has enough money to buy the surplus, otherwise the Government can have money printed and simply buy the final surplus. It would outbid the private sector in this scenario. This would be tantamount to confiscation, since it's not allowing the people who produce to have access to the surplus. It also removes incentives for people to work harder to get access to more money to then get a larger share of the surplus. The Government creates enough money to properly price the surplus goods and services so that you don't have deflation or too much inflation. And this is where you have to be careful that the rich don't consume too much of the surplus pie from the poor. And you want these prices to be relatively stable, so that people can make projections, people can start businesses and so on. Now this is simplified of course, but it's a broad overview of what happens.



**The army and religion**

Religions and the army were the first exterior, non-productive sectors that received money first and spent it into a society. Government takes that role now. It was just a way to organise the first societies. An exaggerated example given in Debt: The First 5000 years is as follows: A King has a large army that he wants to maintain. But supplying it is difficult, expensive and time consuming. Not to mention the logistics. So what he does is hands out a bunch of coins to his soldiers, demands some of them back as taxes, and boom, you have an economy. The soldiers want to spend these coins they've been given, and people need to have them to pay tax. So the economy becomes organised as people want to provide goods and services to the soldiers, and from the outside, this would look like a 'natural market'. Why does the army get the money first in this instance? It provides an intangible service: safety in an uncertain world. Religion is very similar in this regard, as it provides salvation and reassurance in an uncertain world. 


**Government debt**

Is simply the surplus the private sector has to play with. The debt isn't something to be 'paid off'. Moreover, the government debt (a number) is not tied to resources; so that all this talk of future generations working off government debt is nonsense. It is not that way and it cannot be that way. It would be undesirable to 'pay off' the government's debt, as this would destroy a lot of money in the private sector. In this instance, the Government debt just has a PR problem.


**Wealth**

It's easy to think of wealth as simply a high number in someone's bank account. So for example, you might imagine that a wealthy person just has a really high number in their bank account. You might have 700 dollars, and then you think the rich person has 1 million dollars in their bank account. But that's simply not the case. A lot of their money is in bonds, stocks, other assets and so on. The wealth is just the accumulated value of these investments. But it's not just a high number in the bank account. What difference does it make? Not just in terms of higher interest rates, but that the rich have a vested interest in keeping the economy going, and a slight downturn in those investments can mean a large loss in wealth. And so the wealth is partly contingent on time. This is where discussion on the minimum wage comes in. People often use Wal-Mart as an example. For the last financial year, the profits were 128 billion. It's easy to look at that figure and say that a few hundred million could be garnished off the top and be paid to the workers in the form of a higher minimum wage. But think about this as a micro-economy. Adding more money into the system without any structural changes won't achieve too much. But besides, it's easy to say that the profit can be taken from a bank account that holds the profits of the company. But the heirs wouldn't just have the profits in a large bank account. They invest it. So when you ask for more money from them, it could mean the rich heirs need to pull money out of other investments to then pay their workers more. This is important. It's not a matter of just pulling out money from a bank account where the money is 'stagnating'. Those heirs are investing it, and they may need to sell stocks, bonds, assets and so on to pay these workers extra. Which will then have knock-on effects in the economy. So you're not really looking for a higher minimum wage as you are structural changes that will allow you to live better on the wage you're getting paid or some other changes. So think of wealth as a floating amoeba, that receives constant inputs to keep it afloat. Of course there are outputs, and so the amoeba just floats in a particular spot, given its inputs and outputs. Inputs could be stocks going up, bonds, assets going up in price (but not necessarily value), and other similar windfalls. The person has their own expenses, and this keeps the amoeba floating in a particular spot. The important thing is that wealth has constant inputs; it's not about working for a bit, getting a large amount of money, becoming wealthy, and then just having a 1,000,000 in the bank account and sitting back and relaxing. That's not wealth. Imagine how many people would do this. It could well be a disaster for the economy. This is why the wealthy work so hard. This is why we hear about wealthy people working really hard, and sometimes it's easy to think 'why doesn't that person just slow down?' But this about the effect our system has on people. It's a really good thing that you can't just work for a bit, and sit back and enjoy the money. We require people to keep working! Even the wealthiest amongst us.


**Financial system and the bailouts**

A lot of people were and still are upset about how the financial industry got bailed during the crisis. But this makes perfect sense. The financial sector is where religion and the military used to stand. Both were non-producing sectors, and both spent money into the economy and helped to create and perpetuate markets. So the King would give money to the religious leaders or to the Armies who would then spend the money into the economy, and that money is given value because people worked to get it. The money spent into the economy is given value by the work done by the private sector. So if there's a problem, does it make sense for the King to give the people money directly? Of course not. He gives it either to the military or the religious leaders, and they spend more money into the economy. If he gave the people money directly, and nothing else changed (prices and so on), the people might work less now since they can more easily pay their taxes and have more money left over. You have more money, why work as hard? But everyone would think the same thing, and eventually you get into a spiral, as fewer goods and services are available and so on.",finance,1413001602
economy,"My treatise on money, debt, government and wealth from 5000 years ago to the present (Final part)","You must remember that money is an output of what we do and how we think, it's just the end, external result of our activities. So when people talk about giving people money or bailing out the people, that simply doesn't make sense. If nothing else in the economy changes, just giving the people (private sector) money won't change anything. The money is the output, just the result. You can't feed that into the private (producing) sector. 


So finally, you can get a better understanding of what has happened since 2008. The QE for the most part just refilled lost liquidity. There was virtually no inflation because they didn't add too much to the total amount that the private sector was using. That's what central banks around the world have been doing. Refilling liquidity that was lost when mortgages went bad. But if velocity of money isn't picking up, that's another issue entirely. That's got to do with the behaviour of the people. Not with the money itself. What's the trickle-down effect the Fed is talking about? It's giving money to the financial sector and then hoping they spend it into the economy. The value of the money is in the decisions people make with it,  and so forcing people to spend the money will lessen its value. So all the Fed or any central bank can do is give out money and then hope people spend it wisely (whatever that means in a given region or nation). The problem now is that we seem to have this overwhelming optimism in what central banks can do. If there's a structural problem, money will do nothing in that situation. If the King gives his soldiers coins, but only a small portion of them spend them, then the problem is not the coins. It won't matter what the King gives his soldiers as payment or what promises he makes. He has to use non-monetary means to get the other soldiers to spend their money. So he has to make structural changes. There could be dissatisfaction amongst the soldiers. There could be a problem with production amongst the producing sector. Either way, the fact that the money isn't being spent is just a symptom of something else going on. So in that case, adding more money to the economy won't change anything. 


**A few things to consider:**

A Government can never run out of money that is has sovereign control over

It can always print the money it needs

It does not need a source of revenue

Taxes are not a source of revenue for the government

Tax is a political decision


--But


Why do tax collection agencies go to extreme lengths to collect taxes?

Money has value (or at least part of it) because people pay taxes

The work the private sector does gives value to money


--Also


Production drives growth

Without production, there is nothing to buy


--But


Consumer spending accounts for 70% of GDP

This is how we trade and interact with one another


**Final points**

There is nothing inherent in any object we have ever used as money. It's all psychological. Even gold and silver have no inherent qualities. They contain some qualities, and it's our psychological makeup and how we've progressed as a species that sees value in those qualities. Outside of the way we are as people, gold and silver do not matter. Money just has to be an external representation of what's going in our heads. We humans have a propensity to lie, cheat, deceive or simply not tell the truth. It's very hard to tell if someone is being genuine. Yet in this world, we must deal with one another. So money provides external proof of at least some aspect of our dealings with one other.

-Allows us to live with strangers and be anonymous in large cities
-Allows us to get rich (with the help of a governing power)",finance,1413001741

I have a business I'm contemplating selling for about $4 million. 

I'll find a qualified professional to help me but this came up suddenly and unexpectedly so I'm trying to work up a spreadsheet.  I'm mostly confused about capital gains.  Here are my questions:

1.  It looks like I have to pay 20% federal capital gains tax.  Do I also pay the 3.8% ACA tax on top of that?  My business has no physical assets.  It's a software company.

2.  I've read up on the ""4% rule"".  Will I be paying 23.8% tax (federal capital gains plus ACA tax) on the investment income, then?

3.  My state imposes a capital gains tax as well.  I'm assuming that I should just plan to move before the sale of the business and try to schedule the actual sale to take place after the first of the year.  Is that tax evasion?",finance,1413001956

The gist is that I basically want to pay off a huge portion of my high-interest CC with my savings, but I need my savings money because I don't have enough income coming in.

**Debt**

- I have about $800 on my Visa with an interest rate of 19.99%, with a credit limit of $1000. This is my main priority right now, as you can see, I've used 80% of my limit. I pay off more than my minimum every month- but this is mostly because my internet is charged on this CC and I use the money I earned from subletting my room this summer to pay it off. 

- I'm also an additional card holder on my mom's credit card, and I have roughly $300-$500 I owe on that credit card. I believe that interest rate on that card is 1.50% p.a up to TD Prime +12.75%p.a.

Problem is that I didn't work for the first 2 weeks of school, relied on the CC (both mine and my mom's) to pay for my textbooks, supplies, clothes, groceries and medicine (parents forgot to inform insurance company). I get paid on a weekly basis, but the paycheque is for the hours I worked 2 weeks ago. 

Another problem is that my work study supervisor was not aware I got 100 extra hours this year (compared to only 200 hours last year), so she only had me working 6 hours/week for the first 2 weeks. I worked only 3 hours this week because of Thanksgiving and studying for midterms, and won't be working the week I get back because of midterms as well.

So basically the first 2 paycheques I've received so far was only $70/paycheque (or $140 in total. First pay was on Oct 3), I'll be paid about $40 this upcoming week and none the week after that. So I won't be making any decent amount of money until the end of October/beginning of November.

personalfinance,"Vet in debt, seeking financial wisdom.","Hi PF, So here's my situation: (sorry for the long read)

I graduated in 2012 from an expensive veterinary school, the kind of school where you graduate ~275K in student loan debt. (I know, I know - I should've known what I was getting myself into). So the problem is, while veterinarians make decent money, the amount of debt we go into is not proportional to my salary. I make 102.5K/year (~105K counting intermittent per diem shifts). Take home about $5300/month. As I see it, especially when I started paying back my loans, my only option is to take advantage of the income-based repayment program. Through that, I pay ~835$/month. This is based on what I make, what I owe, loan interest rates, etc. The problem is that this doesn't even cover interest and my loan amount is steadily increasing (now closer to 310K). The way this program works is that after 25 years worth of payments, my loans are forgiven. This is all well and good, except that the remaining balance is considered taxable income for that year. This means I'll be looking at a huge expense in about 22 years (I'm not smart enough to do the actual math, but I know it's going to be big)

My question is this: What the hell do I do to prepare for this?

More info: I'm newly married, awesome 6yr old stepson from her previous marriage. I own a house under my name, bought for 200K (valued at ~225K - previous owner got a dream job and needed to sell quick and wanted to break even). We live in a middle to upper-middle class town in Connecticut. Wife is a real-estate agent, but has recently slowed down a lot because she just went back to finish school to become an elementary school teacher (should be done in 2-3 years).

Income: $5300/month - me, $600/month (child support) + possible closings - her

monthly expenses: mortgage - $1700
                             loans - $835
                             utilities - ~$200-$350
                             car payment - $250 (lease - tax write-off, plan to buy after lease period)
                             credit card - $200-300, total cc debt ~$2200
                             Roth IRA - $150, aggressively allocated in ETFs, $2200 so far - would like to start increasing contribution
                             Other expenses/recreation - ~$400-$600
                             I feel like I'm missing some expenses...

(Some of who are quite conservative) It was well recieved so I thought I might submit it here. It's nothing that hasn't really been said before, but I hope some find value in it. I also have some graphs at the bottom for any interested.

If I were to accept a job today at the federal minimum wage, ($7.25 in the U.S.) and travel back in time to 1968, adjusted for inflation, I would be paid $1.06/hr. That doesn't seem like much, but we can go even further and compare myself to a minimum wage worker of 1968 -- who would out-earn me by $0.54/hr. That comes out to $1,123.20 annually - assuming full-time work. In 2014 dollars, that min. wage worker of 1968 made $7,676.88 more than me. Ouch!


Indeed, between the years of 1956 and 1986, each and every minimum wage worker of their time would out-earn my $7.25/hr. of today.

On a smaller time-scale, we still see significant depreciation of buying power. The last time the minimum wage was increased was in 2009, when it was raised to the current $7.25. If I were to work full-time at my min. wage job today, I would have $1,476.80 less buying power this year than I would making the same wage in 2009, only five years ago. Three years before that, 2006, our federal minimum wage was $5.15. A worker in 1968 would have out-earned someone from 2006 by $10,110.60 annually. (2014 dollars)


It is no surprise then that issues of rising costs in healthcare, tuition, childcare, and housing to an extent, are so hotly debated.

Of course, these examples are still quite generalized and sweeping. Many states have their own minimum wages, many of which are higher than the federal (e.g. WA @ $9.32, OR @ $9.10, CA @ $9.00), but some are still lower - or worse - non-existent.


To my previous generations reading this, I would encourage you to try to recall the period of time that you yourself entered the workforce, or were beginning to raise your family, or put yourself through college/university. What was your average wage back then? What would you have been making now, adjusted for inflation?

I'm curious to know.

For anyone wondering, I got all my information for minimum wages from the U.S. Department of Labor's website here: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm

And used the inflation calculator found on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website here:
http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm

* additional savings: 600 per month to above savings account  
* remaining money per month: 1300(food and entertainment comes from here)

Overall I am quite happy with where I am right now financially. I can afford to do the things I want and then some. I am now starting to dial in some spending and starting to cook more myself and not eat out as much.  I am looking into more financial investments with my extra income.  This year I finally turned things around and got things under control. I am still spending a LOT on entertainment and food out of my remaining income.  I don't carry over any CC debt, just use it for points.  Credit score is 760 or so.  I want to buy another house here soon(Owned and sold one with my divorce) and am starting to think just sinking as much of my extra income into the savings for now would be a good move going forward. The reason I am looking into real estate is it would allow me to cut my tax rate down quite a bit with all of the interest deductions I could have.   I am not sure if paying down the auto payment should be my first priority or just maximizing my liquid money right now.  Maybe up my retirement account a bit more and work on saving? /r/personalfinance seems to think auto loans at 2% are not much of a concern to pay down all that quick, though 480 a month in savings would be nice.

1.  Treasuries have artificially inflated demand bc of fund mandates.
2. LIBOR is more relevant from the standpoint of interest rate exposure and hedging

personalfinance,taxable investments vs paying off a mortgage,"I asked myself this question a while and decided that while mutual funds would likely out-perform the loss of interest payments from paying off my 4.875% mortgage, the impact would be too small to justify the risk. So, what I did this past year was max out my 401(k) and IRA, and put whatever else I could save into additional mortgage payments towards principle.

Now I'm looking at refinancing. Rates are very low right now, and I will probably be here long enough to justify the fees. I'm trying to decide between a 10 year loan with the lowest possible rate and a payment that I could easily afford, vs another 30 year loan with the lowest possible monthly payment, which would leave me with enough money to invest in mutual funds. I'm already maxing out my tax-advantaged investments, so that would mean paying taxes on mutual fund gains. 

I think I understand the risks involved with investing in the market, and there should be some cost associated with that risk. Paying down a mortgage sounds like a very low-risk investment, so even if the interest saved is a bit lower than the anticipated interest earned through stock market investments, paying off the mortgage might be the better move.

I've been using 6% as my assumption for how my stock market investments will grow, on average, over the next 30 years. I'm currently 33 years old, and my goal is to save money for retirement.

personalfinance,Should we be making extra principal payments into our mortgage?,"Hi PF,

So here's a little background.

I am 29 years old and my base gross salary is $69.5k + $11k to $15k in gross overtime pay. My wife is a 26-year-old graduate student and receives a taxable stipend from her university of $23k gross a year. In September 2013 we took out a 15-year fixed rate mortgage (at 2.875%) of $232,000 and we have been making extra principal payments of between $400 to $700 a month ever since. We currently owe $209,000 on our mortgage because of these extra monthly payments.

A lot of people have been telling me that because our interest rate is so low, that we should take the extra $500 to $800 a month and invest it elsewhere. But when I ask ""where?"" no one has an answer for me.

I currently contribute the maximum amount of $17,500 per year into my 403(b) plan and whatever money I have left over after monthly expenses goes into a Barclays Savings Account that earns 0.9% APY.

I've considered instead maxing out on a Roth IRA with the extra principal payments instead, but I feel that the benefit of having a mortgage paid off by my mid-30s would be greater overall.

Anticipated Income Changes: In May 2015 my base gross salary will increase to $75k/year, in Sep 2015 it'll be at 78k/year, in Sep 2016 it'll be $82k/year, in Sep 2017 it'll be $86k/year, and finally in Sep 2018 it'll be at 90.5k/year. We are also anticipating that my wife will have a full-time job that pays at least $45k/year beginning Fall 2015, which means that we can possibly have the mortgage paid off within the next five years if we double or even triple our extra monthly principal payments. Question is: is that smart?

What do you guys think? Any suggestions? Should we or should we not be making extra principal payments? And if not, then where should we invest the extra money we would have used for extra principal payments?

If the interest rate on your mortgage is relatively high, then option 1 makes sense. However, rates are very low right now and I am looking at refinancing. How low would your mortgage rate have to be to switch strategies and go with option 2, accepting the increase in interest payments because you can reasonably expect to make up for your mortgage interest losses in taxable stock market investments?

edit: My goal for the money I wish to invest, either by paying down the mortgage sooner with option 1 or with taxable stock market investments in option 2, is to increase the money I have for retirement (age 65-death).

Part of this process involved reluctantly looking at my credit score on Credit Karma. That part hurt.

Credit Karma says that I have missed 5 out of that last 202 payments I have made (that ~97.5% on time), giving me a very bad score for Repayment History. I desperately want to fix this, and herein lies the rub.

If I consolidate my student loans, I will go from having 13 monthly payments to only having 5. It seems that it will take longer to cover up those 5 missed payments. Based on a really quick calculation in Excel, with 13 monthly payments, it will take me until September of 2016 to be 99%+ on-time. With only 5, it will take until October of 2019! 

Also, will consolidation decrease my number of accounts? Will it meaningfully decrease my average account age? Am I oversimplifying how credit scoring works? I have never looked at or though about my finances before, so I am really new to all of this.

personalfinance,"Tax-exempt muni bond fund for first house down payment, five year target (NYC)?","The general wisdom I've read through searching /r/personalfinance is to save via Savings bonds or I-bonds. Or maybe high-yield savings accounts/CDs. I think this wisdom is sound and, to be honest it may not be worth the extra risk/effort just to grind out a few extra bps of yield over five years. However, here are my thoughts:

* Location is NYC (within the five boroughs)
* Bond fund is Vanguard NY LT Tax-Exempt Investor (VNYTX)
* Saving $3k/month toward down payment over 4-5 years
* Marginal tax rate (incl local, state, federal) is ~45%

Since our marginal tax rate is relatively high, any non-exempt yields will effectively be cut in half. VNYTX current SEC yield is 2.1%. Since NY munis are tax-exempt from local, state, and federal taxes, the taxable-equivalent yield is closer to 4%.

On the other hand, there's obviously significant interest rate risk. However, I think the interest rate risk would be somewhat mitigated by the NYC real estate emphasis on cap rates. As interest rates rise, investors (a significant portion of the NYC RE market) will require higher cap rates/lower prices. As a result, any principal losses in the bond fund will be matched by (relatively) lower purchasing price. This is probably not a safe 1-for-1 assumption but I think it does mitigate some of the interest rate risk.

As an alternative, I've also considered a staggered approach. VNYTX maintains 6-10 year average duration. Since I'm looking at a 5 year horizon, the early installments should be closely duration-matched (further mitigating interest rate risk) and I can gradually shift a portion of the monthly savings into lower risk vehicles.",finance,1413132858
personalfinance,comparing mortgage interest to stock growth - when to keep debt so you have more money to invest,"I thought this was a relatively simple calculation: if your mortgage rate is less than the return on investment, it makes sense to keep the debt and invest the money. I know there are other considerations like wanting equity to make a down payment, and the risk of losing money in the investment. I tried making a spreadsheet to quantify the advantage of making minimum payments only on a low-interest mortgage, while instead investing money in the stock market. I assumed a mortgage interest rate of 3%/year, and a stock growth of 4.5%/year (6% growth taxed at 25%). 4.5&gt;3, so I expected to see a higher balance after 5 years of low mortgage payments and high stock investments, but the results are reverse: it's saying I'm better off paying down the 3% mortgage than seeing a 4.5% growth on the same money. There is either something wrong with my spreadsheet or something wrong with my understanding.

[Here is a link to the spreadsheet](http://www.filedropper.com/mortgagevsstocks). It compares three options: monthly mortgage payments that would pay off the house in 7, 10, or 15 years. The 7 year option has the highest monthly mortgage payments, and all options assume I spend that amount each month. With the 10 and 15 year mortgage options, the additional money is invested in the stock market and grows at 4.5%.

I created the spreadsheet to also compare differences in rates for refinancing to a 10 or 15 year mortgage; the ""7 year"" option would be a 10 year mortgage with additional payments. Prior to uploading I set the mortgage rate for all options at the same: 3%. This should, in theory, show the advantage of keeping the low interest debt while investing in a higher interest investment. It shows the opposite. 

Please let me know if you see something wrong with my spreadsheet. Thanks!

edit: I created a simplified spreadsheet ([click here to download](http://www.filedropper.com/simplifiedmortgagevsstocks)) which seems to confirm that my understanding was correct. There must just be an error in the original spreadsheet, which is probably more complicated than it needs to be.

edit 2: **question answered** The error is in calculating market investment growth. My spreadsheet was not applying growth to the balance carried over from the previous year.

personalfinance,I need some structure and help building it.,"Hey guys, here's my situation. I make good money for my age, and I also have a fair amount of debt and I'm trying to get guidance on what steps to take to mitigate my debt and be able to start saving. (I'd love to start college but finances keep upsetting that notion) 

Firstly, here is a list of my debt owed:

* car loan 1: $1,718.23 I gave this car to my parents to help them out. I pay $104 a month on this car.

* Car loan 2 (signature loan) $2,053.07 monthly cost is 61.52

* Best buy credit card: $2,707.91 I pay minimum $35 monthly, but this is about to come out of it's no interest rate period (within 6 months) at which point it will jump to something exorbitant like 18%

* Credit card 1: $1,000 (just under this and currently has no interest although that will change within a month) I have yet to make monthly payments so i'm not sure here.

* Credit card 2: $2,007.97 montly is ~$50

* Overdraft account: $479.09

* Personal loans/money I owe friends: ~$1000 (closer to $800 I believe but $1000 is easier to work with)

This totals out to be just under $11,000 of debt.

My monthly payments with phone and everything exluding gas and food comes out to be about $730 although I just got in an accident and am in the process of purchasing a new car so my insurance is going to go up. I use anywhere from $40-60 in gas a week with my current gas sipper vehicle (just got totalled) and eat for usually about $50 a week.

I currently make minimum $1,000 a week, closer to $1,500 (my goal is $2,000 weekly) but am taxed nearly 35% resulting in a reliable $500+ a check. 
I am due to receive just over $6,000 (this is after factoring in tax, originally I'm receiving ~$10,000) this Wednesday and will be getting my first of the $1,000+ checks the following friday. (I'm paid weekly) On november 15th I'm due to recieve another bonus ~$700-800 check as well as what I'll be making weekly. Tax returns usually yield about $2,000 

Now for the questions (sorry I know this is a novel at this point) 
As I just recently mentioned I totaled my car (signature loan) and expect the insurance will pay ~$1,000 (it was a beater but got 45+mpg) and so I have a few options. Repair the metro, purchase a used car (looked at a hyndai accent for 4k, and a few hondas for 5-7) or purchase a 2005 chevy malibu from a friend for $3,400 (130,000 miles with an engine with 89,000) and have someone drive it out to me and fly that person back ~$500 any guidance one what to do with regards to the vehicle is welcome.

My original plan had been to pay off about $5,000 of the debt and put the other $1,000 into savings but the predicament with my vehicle has changed this. I should mention I can do a lot of work on my vehicles and save money that way and have an extremely cheap mechanic ($400 for an engine swap, $150 for a clutch change, etc.)

Basically I thrive on structure but suck at creating it. If I made some sort of budget with your guys' help and got some guidance on what to do with the $6,000 check coming that'd be extremely helpful. Sorry for the short story.",finance,1413134234

&gt; Clarida, et. al discuss and derive the New Keynesian Phillips Curve along with review the literature (at that time) regarding monetary policy. Since there has been, as we all know, a huge amount of talk about the Fed, Fed policies, and interest rates, why not have a paper that deals with the science of monetary policy.

Abstract:

&gt;This paper reviews the recent literature on monetary policy rules. We exploit the monetary policy design problem within a simple baseline theoretical framework. We then consider the implications of adding various real world complications. Among other things, we show that the optimal policy implicitly incorporates inflation targeting. We also characterize the gains from making a credible commitment to fight inflation. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we show that gains from commitment may emerge even if the central bank is not trying to inadvisedly push output above its natural level. We also consider the implications of frictions such as imperfect information.

personalfinance,PF - Help me with my plan of attack on debt. Looking for some perspective,"Thank you in advance PF! I have learned much from coming here and reading up on the FAQ and the (good) advice. I'd like to lay out my current state of affairs along with the plan I have for paying off debt. I'm looking to just check my head - make sure I haven't missed anything. Okay -- here goes:

* Current Debt (mine)

Private student loan: $4,800.00 / APR 5.25%

Federal student loans: $70,100.00 / APR 6.8%

In repayment -- on the Income Based payment for the Federal loans at $70/month, the Private loan payment is also $70/month.


* Current debt (spouse)

Federal student loans: will be about $25,000 (not sure on the APR)

Private student loan: $3,700.00 / APR 10.74%

Private student loan: $7,500 / APR 9.24%

Still in school, not in repayment yet.


* Combined credit card balances

Credit Card #1: $3,600 / APR 8.5%

Credit Card #2: $800 / APR 9.9% 


* I am fully aware of the high APR on the private loans. These were taken out as an absolutely necessary bridge to get us through the last year of community college. Once we both hit university - the federal loans were available, I have more because my APR was better, so we lived off of mine. He started taking out loans after I graduated. And yes, the credit card balances. Well, there they are. Haven't added anything to them in months and months but still, the balance hangs on. 

 
Right now I have one full month of current expenses saved in our Emergency Fund. I have another $1200 in a separate savings account, the minimum bank balance is $1,000 to keep from getting monthly fees, so it just sits there. I guess it could be used in a true emergency and would cover a months rent and a bill or two if need be, but I don't think of it as part of our EF.

There are other assets in a 401(k), Roth, etc. (not much but not our focus right now.) I contribute the minimum to my employers 401(k) to get the match. I stopped the rest of the contributions a few months ago to begin a dedicated EF.

So my question really --- I vacillate between the /r/PF recommended 3-to-6-month EF, and the Dave Ramsey $1,000 saved before beginning debt repayments. Clearly I'm leaning towards the PF minimum.... but now that I have a full month saved up, I'm looking at my spouses private loans with those ridiculous interest rates and am itching to tackle them. I would like to see them gone before the repayment begins.

Spouse will graduate with a BS in electrical engineering -- so work prospects are good. My concern is if the job hunt takes a while. Which makes me think that saving a full 3 months would be more prudent than focusing on the private loans.

Should I continue to save for the EF until we hit the 3 month mark? Or... in our case, is one month enough so I can aggressively go after those private loans? I know it's mostly a judgement call, and there is no substitute for a safety net. When looking at all of the debt itemized out, it feels insecure enough as it is. But... those private loans are just dreadful.

When spouse **does** get a job - we'll be in a much better place to make some headway. As I'm the only one working right now -- the available funds to focus on EF's and/or debts is limited; which is why I'm wanting an outside opinion. I want to start paying on the private loans, but don't want to shoot myself in the foot either.",finance,1413135164

My big issue is to figure out where to put the money I'm saving for the day I leave my job to pursue the degree and take a part-time job to give me enough to cover a phone, car insurance, and most importantly, food.  Target time to begin at the new University is Fall 2015 with two years left.  Ideally, most of my aid is going to be in the form of military tuition assistance, select reserve GI bill, and federal student loans.  For next year, I'll have made too much this year to qualify for much FAFSA or State Aid.  This is why savings is the issue.

I was wondering, besides the bank and credit union methods of saving, are there any hidden gems in saving for this sort of thing outside of those that would be more effective?  The only special things that I see mostly are accounts that allow parents to save for their children, not young adults planning to go back.

personalfinance,Should I become am authorized user on my parents account?,"Sorry this got longer than I expected instead of making multiple posts 
I read in the FAQ that becoming an authorized user on a parents credit card with a good long history can positively affect your credit report and FICO score a little bit. I brought the idea up to my parents and they don't mind but I was wondering if it was worth it for my idea. 

I am going to be getting my first job as a mechanic after this semester ends. I am going to have to start acquiring tools which is expensive. I would have to take out a loan or go through the tool companys' credit systems. Would being an authorized user on my parents account with 25+ years of no missed, on time payments help me to qualify for lower interests rates and better loan conditions
I would also depending on my income want to look into buying a new more fuel efficient car and would like to get the same kind of low interest rates and better conditions on a loan for that as well. I would be getting these loans through my credit union. 
Between them they have a few cards with 25+ years of excellent history. Would it be worth it to be added to more than just one if they were willing?
My parents are also trying to move now and are going to get a mortgage. Is there a time when we should not add me as to not affect their credit while getting a mortgage?
Does this sound reasonable? If not I am here to learn so correcting me is welcome. 

As for my history. I have one unsecured student card that I'm sure was given to me with the expectation of Me over spending with it to trap me in debt. But I live with in my means and have paid it off every month in full since I got it two years ago.

Also I was wondering what bills do affect your report and score. I read in the FAQ that utilities don't count unless sent to collections. Or are they all like that?

personalfinance,An IRS delay is preventing me from getting my financial aid. Is there anything I can do?,"I'm an independent student attending a state university as an in-state student, and because my income is very low, I receive a tuition aid grant from my state in addition to federal aid like the Pell Grant. I'm planning to graduate in 2016.

In 2013, I had no income, but I filed my taxes anyway because I wanted to apply for the American Opportunity Tax Credit. I filed using TurboTax on March 21st, 2014 and I was supposed to get a refund of $1000. 

Months passed, and I heard nothing from the IRS. In the meantime, I found a full-time job for the summer and a different part-time job on campus for the fall, so I wasn't starving. I also went through all the paperwork for my financial aid for the 2014-2015 school year, right up until my state financial aid office requested a transcript of my 2013 taxes. By this time, it was late July.

I went to the IRS website and applied for it, and it wasn't available. So then I called the IRS as soon as I was able and the woman I spoke to told me that there was a delay, but that the system showed that they'd finished processing my taxes and the transcript would be available by the end of August. I wasn't happy about cutting it so close, but I accepted that. 

It was not available by the end of August. Unfortunately, waiting on hold with the IRS takes so long that I wasn't able to call again until mid-September. This woman told me that the first woman was wrong, but that my taxes really were done and that because of the way their system works, I would have my transcript by the end of October. She also gave me the number for their tax advocate service, but the person there was no help - honestly, it didn't even seem like she wanted to help. She asked me when I filed in this nasty tone which dropped when I told her it was in March, but she told me there was nothing they could do.

At this point, I'm getting desperate. The deadline to send in any remaining paperwork is November 11th. I still don't have a tax transcript, and my state financial aid office has been very clear that they will not accept anything else. My federal aid has been disbursed, but there's a little over $200 outstanding on my tuition and I have to pay for the second semester in January. 

What do I do? I don't understand why the IRS didn't contact me for a copy of my 1099 if they didn't believe I was really a student - I would have sent it in within a day. I don't even care about the refund at this point - I just can't believe that I'm in danger of losing a $9000 grant that I really need because of this. I would have never applied for it if I'd known that this was a real risk.

TL;DR: Filed my taxes, IRS didn't process them for months, can't get a tax transcript proving my income to give to my state financial aid office so they'll disburse my tuition aid grant estimated at around $9000.",finance,1413150555

I made a lot (and I mean A LOT) of dumb decisions when I was younger, and I took out way more than I needed. Now that I've graduated and become financially responsible, I'm trying to figure out the smartest/fastest way to pay my loans down.

I have two jobs, and after taxes I make about $30,000 a year. My living expenses are about $10,000 a year. Aside from my student loan debt, I have no debts or loans. Here is a table of all my loans: 

Institution	Loan Amount	Interest rate

tl;dr: I want to pay my loans off NOW. Would consolidating my loans help reduce the overall interest I pay, in addition to reducing my payments?

personalfinance,"Refinancing home to increase monthly cash flow (Ontario, CA)","Hi all.  I'm looking for serious advise or thoughts on the following.  I've had a lot of hate about this and I know you guys are better than that.

Back in 2008 when young and not well financially educated, I bought a house for 214,000$ with a 5,000$ cash back from the bank with an interest rate of 7.35%.  Closed term for 7 years over a 25 year amortization.  (I though myself pretty smart to insist that the bank calculate my loan amount based on my take home pay.)  The only other debt at the time were our vehicles and my wife's student loans.  Between 2008 and 2010 my wife worked part-time as faculty at our college so we lived comfortably.  Once we had our eldest and we decided that she would be a stay at home mom, I knew that my full time job would pay the fixed expenses (mortgage, taxes, utility bills, debts, etc...) while my regular part-time job would provide us with the money for food, gas, clothing, and other variable expenses.  Student loan payment was increased at our request from 109/mo for 10 years to 300/mo for 4.5 years.

June 2013, a few months after the birth of our second, money was getting tight.  I panicked and got a consolidation loan of 10,500$ to pay off the remaining ~3,000$ student loan, ~3,000$ on wife's car, 2,000$ income tax, and 500$ to make a few household repairs.  This was to be repaid over 5 years at 3.xx%.  

In February 2014 we made some drastic changes such as selling her vehicle, eliminating cable, and sold many of the things we were no longer using.  We also started attacking that loan and today we're down to owing 3,800$.  In March of 2014 my regular part-time position was changed to casual, and since summer was approaching, shifts were plenty, but now that winter is right around the corner, I've gone from four per month to 1 or 2.  This is an income reduction of about 1,200$/mo when averaged out.

Consequently, money was and remains very tight.  We're not sinking, but we're very close.  Luckily we did not acquire new debt as we don't use credit cards as a matter of principle nor do we have overdraft on our account.  Some of you may appreciate the challenge of providing enough money for a family of four and a dog on one income in a world designed for two.  If the part-time job has no work, we only have 500$ left over for variable expenses, which is impossible to make work in Northern Ontario where public transit is next to useless.

Today our mortgage stands at 172,900$.  After speaking with our banker, the options are....

**Refinancing:**  Incur 5,500$ worth of penalties for the cash-back and breaking the mortgage early which can be added to the mortgage total.  We want to use the equity to pay off the car and loan (8,000$ total) and put the remainder back on the mortgage.  Have a closed 4-year term at 2.95% (promotional rate) for 15, 20, or 30 years.  Accelerated bi-weekly payments including property taxes would be around 700$, 540$, 340$ respectively.  With a 20 year there would be enough money left over to pay all variables with some left over for savings *or* slush funds (house/car repairs, window replacement, vet bills, etc...).  The 30 year option would free up 1,600$/mo and allow us to pay all variables, save around 450$/mo *and* contribute to slush funds.  Mortgage total now would be around 183,000$.

**Re-negotiate:** Same as above, except the 5,500$ in penalties and fees would have to be paid out of pocket.  Actually, it would have to be borrowed, which we don't want to do as it means new debt.  As such, we would still have the car and loan payments as well as a new 5,500$ debt.  Mortgage would remain at 172,900$.

Regardless of the option we choose, we plan on attacking the mortgage just like we did with the consolidation loan as we want to have it paid in 13 years.

The other option is to do nothing and dangerously tread water for the next nine months when the mortgage comes due and the car is paid.

As much as it would pain me to increase the mortgage total, we're thinking that freeing up some cash flow would allow us to not only save, but put money aside for various eventualities.  No more barely enough gas to get to work and barely enough to fill the fridge.  Considering that those are our only three debts, it's not that bad of a situation.....I think.

I also realize that it's really only moving debt from a higher interest rate loan to a lower one, but will that really matter in a few years?  What are your constructive thought?

FWIW: If my wife were to work, it would probably only be part-time and our debt would have to increase for a second vehicle (used), daycare (which is notoriously difficult to find), and before and after school care.  In other words, she'd work to pay these new bills and not much more.

edit: words

edit 2: A major reason that we decided that we would live off one income is that child care were unavailable for the days which I work as well (12-hour shifts).  Also, what would be left of her part-time income at the end of the month, once extra expenditures were considered, was less than what I make in one shift at the part-time job.  Plus we really value having our kids raised at home by us rather than daycare, so yes, we knew there would be a trade off of less cash for more family time.",finance,1413152625

personalfinance,Student Loans - Should I Pay More than Minimum?,"I've recently graduated college in May 2014 with about $29,000 of federal loans and $6000 in private loans. Unfortunately, I didn't exactly choose the most profitable degree (history). I plan on paying off the private loan as quickly as possible. I applied for IBR because I'm working a job that only pays ~$14,400 a year and there isn't really anywhere to go, as far as promotions, etc. However, I'm curious if it makes sense to pay anymore than the minimum on the IBR plan for my federal loans? I'm putting a lot of the money I make into savings for a car (detailed in the next paragraph). I'm also considering a graduate program in the next 2 years for Student Affairs, which is something I'd like to make into a career. Also, the program has two benefits, as it 1) would be free since the program involves having an assistantship that pays for the tuition 2) i was under the impression that working in a nonprofit university postgrad would qualify me for loan forgiveness (after 10 years). Note that I'm not counting on the 10 year forgiveness, I'm just considering it as a possibility if all goes as planned.

As far as financial expenditures on a monthly basis, out of my ~$1200:

* $1000 - savings for a car (I use my mom's currently)

* $30 - cell phone bill

* Rest goes towards various costs like food, recreation, etc.

personalfinance,"Secured credit cards, financial disaster, and me. Any and all advice gratefully received.","My situation is bad, but I am taking concrete steps to address it.

Background: I have never been really capable of taking care of myself,
financially; for whatever reason, the lessons my parents imparted were
insufficient or I was not receptive. I am very well remunerated and
have never had trouble getting work, but I've lived paycheck to
paycheck for a long time.

As long as I can convince a computer to handle my finances, I'm fine;
but the smallest setback causes a terrible spiral of avoidance, and
what could be easily solved (one month's late payment on taxes!)
becomes a disaster (no payment of taxes for six years!)

I'm coming out of a bad divorce three years ago, and I made a variety
of terrible decisions (bought a car I couldn't afford, moved into a
much too expensive apartment, spent EVERY SINGLE PENNY I earned),
stiffed my bank, and then skipped the country (this is, by the way,
not an advisable way to deal with problems).

The car was repossesed; I was evicted; I stopped paying my credit card
debt. I had even borrowed money from a boss, and I was avoiding his
calls to keep from having to think about it.

So that's the bad. I was left with about $100k in debt in a variety of
instruments. But there's a sunny side: through a helpful new partner,
a good shrink, and a fantastically lucky job opportunity that dropped
a serious windfall in my lap, I determined that a) debt repayment and
financial adulthood were my #1 priority; and b) knowing my own
inability to keep money issues sorted, I needed help. So I hired
someone to help me negotiate with my debtors, and now have less than
$15k in debt to go, with a payment schedule already worked out.

So, yay me! My questions are then about rebuilding access to credit.

I have an ""Opportunity"" account with Wells Fargo, which is
checking/savings that they offer to people with black marks in
ChexSystems; and I have an account with a smaller bank in
Texas (People's Bank of Paris Texas) that I was able to open even in
the throes of my initial repayment disaster.

It seems to me that the correct course of action now is to get a
secured credit card (Wells Fargo will not issue me one until I display
good behavior for some period of time), close my People's Bank
account, arrange the payment plan with my final creditor, and buy
myself a nice bottle of wine on the day I send out my final check.

So we get to my (long-winded) question: what's the best secured credit
card to get? My expense situation dictates that I need to put about
$1500/mo onto it (unreimbursed travel for work), but I would like to
be able to handle small emergencies as they arise.

Over the last year I pay off the almost 6k in CC debt (I have $700 left on a 0% interest store card).

3. Worked for the same firm for the last 4 years, I have GREAT job security here but pay could be better. I picked up a part time serving job to get a little extra income.

4. Now that I have got the CC debt under control, and a great credit score for my age, I would like to really start nailing down my student loan debt.

Summary:

Income:
Engineering Job: $54k gross + 2k bonus, so say $56k gross. After I pay taxes and contribute 3% to my 401k, I take home $1,390 bi-weekly.
Serving Job: 2 nights per weekend, roughly $100 a shift. Money is usually used to survive between my paychecks from my main job

Total Debt:
$350 CC @ 0% interest
$400 CC @ 17.99% 
both of which should be paid off within the next 2 pay periods. Already paid off 4 cards and locked them away.

Fedloan - $24,027 @ 6.25% ($193 min/month)
AES - $24,496 @ 3.66% ($172 min/month)
ParentPlus (In Dad's Name) - $40,100 @7.9% ($392 min/month)



Other Expenses (per month):
Rent - $800 (2-br apartment)
Phone - $80
Internet - $80
Car Insurance - $45
Water/electric/gas - $130

I wanna pay off my Dad's portion with a personal loan in my name, not only to lower the interest rate, but to get my debt out of my dad's name.

The real issue is that each paycheck is entirely allocated to my debts and bills the day I get paid so I never miss a payment, I then live off the cash from the second job for the 2 weeks until my next paycheck comes.

Over the last year, I paid down almost $6k in credit card debt using the snowball method and have increased my credit score to 760-765 range with NO missed payments and almost 28k in available credit between all my cards, so I have a pretty solid credit rating going for someone my age.

My question for you, how screwed am I for the future and how should I begin attacking my student loans? I have friends my age already buying homes and having kids, I feel like these loans are going to be a burden for me for years to come. Especially since so much of the minimum payment is going towards fucking interest!!!

Please help, any advice is greatly appreciated.

UPDATE 1:
I will have a budget up for you guys soon, in the meantime, has anyone refinanced their loans through CitizensBank, here's the website, with my credit score and my dad as a cosigner, we could combine the 24k @6.25 and 40k @7.9 into 1 loan with 15 year term @ somewhere between 3.2-4.7%

1. Capital One secured - 22.9% APR ; $29 annual fee  
2. First Progress secured - 19.99% APR ; $29 annual fee  
3. First Progress Secured - 11.99% APR ; $44 annual fee

5. CreditOne (unsecured) - 23.9% APR ; $99 annual fee, $75 first year

I may also be able to get approved for a secured card through Navy Federal Credit Union, which I've heard can have better rates, but I am a little reluctant to apply for it or for the unsecured Capital One card, because I don't want to be denied and have a hard inquiry on my report.

**Loan Information :**

All loans were issued as federal stafford loans. I am currently in repayment and 11 months ahead on payment, by way of reduction in principal (""Next required payment : 09/2015""). None of the loans have been consolidated.


Total outstanding balance : ~$28,100


Current - By classification and rate:

Subsidized @ 4.5% - ~$4,400

Subsidized @ 5.6% - ~$3,600

Subsidized @ 6.0% - ~$2,800

Unsubsidized @ 6.8% - ~$12,900


Original - By classification:

Subsidized - ~$20,000

Unsubsidized - ~$24,000 


As required by the original federal loan terms, any prepayment (or extra payment) may be made without penalty and is applied to the loan with the highest interest rate.


My current required monthly payment is ~$500 with ~$200 towards the various subsidized loans and ~$300 towards the unsubsidized loan.

personalfinance,I have no idea what to do with my vehicle situation...,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. 

After a job loss and car accident, I didn't have a ton of extra cash lying around to buy a new car. I ended up with a 2011 Kia Rio, with payments of $330 a month. I hated this car, but it was transportation. 

Last year, I decided to trade in the car for something I could tolerate driving. My credit wasn't the greatest, and I was upside down on the Rio, so I purchased a 2014 Kia Forte for $20,000, and rolled $5,000 from the old loan over. My payments are $626 a month. 

I'm feeling a little suffocated by this loan now. I've made huge improvements to my credit score, and I would like to get rid of my rip off loan. The balance  is currently hovering around $22,500. The trade in value of the car is about $14,000. 

I have 11,000 in cash right now that I could use to pay off the negative loan amount. 

I also have a 2001 Audi A6 that I purchased from a friend. It's worth about $4,500, but it has a couple of small issues to fix before I would rely on it as a daily driver. Otherwise it's mechanically sound, with 13 years of service records. 

It looks like I can make this happen two ways: 

Sell the Kia and use the cash I have to pay the remaining balance, and drive the Audi until it dies. 

Sell the Kia, sell the Audi, and finance a new vehicle at a reasonable interest rate

investing,Dad does not have enough for retirement. Helping him re-allocate investments. Any advice?,"Hi all,

A little quick background on me. I have a degree in finance, used to hold a couple series licenses working for an investment advisory firm.  Hated it, now I am out of that world. So I can understand much of the complicated concepts anyone may toss out. Anyway, here is the situation.

My father is 57. After re-evaluating his portfolio and confessing to not paying close enough attention to his investments, he has roughly $180k saved for retirement. His home will be paid off in around 5 years. He plans on retiring in around 10 years. He knows that he needs to grow his investments, but being so close to retirement, the risk he would need to take to grow his investments is not too palatable for him. He used to have his money with UBS which had him in several different mutual funds that were both under performing and overcharging. He is now at vanguard and wants to focus more on his investments.

This is where I come in. I understand that he does need growth. If he were to retire today and take 3.5% out of his savings annually, that is in the ballpark of the low $500's a month. That is not enough. Though seeing as he only has a 10 year timeline, should we see a sharp correction or large dip in the market, he does not have the time to make up that ground. I am trying to help with the asset allocation, though this timeline is giving me grief as it complicates things. I am not 100% sure what to do. 

My theory, he will have to take a little more risk than he is comfortable with. But nothing ridiculous. No way will 100% in equities work for him. Which is what my old whack a** firm would have recommended. But he does need a slightly higher weight in equities than average. Here is what I am thinking.

- 75-80% in equities. I was thinking a world index would curb some of the volatility. But we like the growth and familiarity of the US market too. So I was thinking of this 70% in equities. 60% of it in the vanguard fund VFINX. It has a pretty low expense ratio, and if we were to buy multiple funds, we would own several iterations of the same stocks and it would not be as streamlined as just mirroring the market. We aren't trying to outperform, we are smart enough to know we aren't that smart enough. So this would be the US based portion of the equities mirroring the S&amp;P. For foreign investments (ex-us, we do not want stock overlap) Vanguards VTMGX seems fine as we want to be diversified outside of the US as well. The performance has been decent in this fund, and the expense ratio is low. So VTMGX at 40% of the equities. 

- 25-20% in bonds. Full disclosure, I am not into bonds, but at his age and timeline I feel they are a necessary part of his investments. Mid and short term bonds are not so hot over the last several years, but at the interest rates we see now, I don't feel long term bonds are a great choice as I feel a rise may come in the foreseeable future (maybe within couple years). So I was thinking a semi-laddering of bond index funds. 10% short term, 30% long, 60% intermediate. Either that, or a balanced bond fund like VBTLX. Even though I am not happy with bonds, this is something he may feel more comfortable with.

So these are all ideas. I would love some feedback, advice, helpful quotes or anything you all want to offer. I want to strike a balance between setting him up for the growth he needs, but not exposing him too much to one thing. Please chime in and feel free to tear this logic apart. Feelings will not be hurt!

Thanks

My wife is Canadian. Well I am too, but I'm also American. But that's another story.

She moved to America after we got married. She had a pretty good job in Toronto prior to our marriage, and had managed to save up a fairly sizable amount of money that is currently sitting in 3 separate Canadian bank accounts.

We don't want to simply have it sitting in these accounts because the interest rates are pitiful (or nonexistent). Attempting to write a check to ourselves to cash/deposit in the US will lead to significant fees in addition to the money lost during conversion from CAD to USD.

Any thoughts on what is the most cost-efficient way to do this?

personalfinance,Home Buying and PMI,"So I'm considering buying my first home soon. Keeping a budget of ~$300k. I only have enough to pay 5% down, which will result in having to pay around $200/mo in PMI. My question is, would it be more cost effective to get a separate loan for the remaining 15% so that I could put down the 20% on the house to avoid a PMI charge. I understand that the separate loan will likely have a higher interest rate and will need to be paid off ASAP. Doing some quick math, I can probably make $500 monthly payments to the separate loan, which will result in a 10 year loan term, while keeping the mortgage at a 30 year loan term. I would likely only be planning to live in this house for 5 years or so, so the extra $200/mo in PMI might be worth it? I really don't know. Any advice is definitely appreciated.",finance,1413222015

personalfinance,Is it worth contributing to 401(k) with a large student loan debt before I qualify for employer matching?,"I just realized that ""You are eligible for matching contributions once you complete one year of service"" (which would be next August). At that point, I can contribute 5% of my salary to the 401(k), and the employer will contribute 4% (100% of the first 3% and 50% of the rest).

However, I have over $70k in student loan debt, with a weighted average interest rate of about 5.8%. I assume it would be in my best interest to put as much money into these loans as I can over the next year, instead of contributing to the 401(k), right? I'm able to deduct up to $2500 in interest payments so there is a tax incentive there as well.

  First time poster. I am unsure if this is the proper subreddit for this type of question, but it is the only one I know of which is somewhat appropriate. 

  As the title says I am at a point in life where a decision must be made. I am 24, engaged to a physically disabled woman, and we have a child who turns three in a few months. My predicament is that my current job does not and will not in the near future provide the income nor the time I need to be able to move forward or even exist as I currently do. 

  1. I work between 52-66 hours a week and only make about 40k a year. This job has basic healthcare for me and my child (no dental). Fiance works at a gym and maybe makes about $200 a week around my current schedule (6:30am-6 Mon-Sat).
2. I have student loans which at the current rate will take 5 more years to pay off. A car payment which will take 4 years. And other monthly bills.
  Monthly Breakdown 
Rent: $1200 (apartment)
  - includes gas/water/sewer/heat/trash/yardwork
Food: $800
Electric: $60-$80
Car Insurance: $115
Car: $232
Student Loans:$166
Cell: $88
Fuel: $180
Cable/Internet: $100
3. Fiance does not drive, she watches our child during the day and at  night either I or, a few days a week, my mother in law watches her at night. Daycare at this point is not a possibility because of finances and logistics of picking her up. 

This is where the predicament comes. My child will be school aged before we know it. Which will require someone to get her on the bus and someone to see her off of the bus. Something has to give. Either I need to be able to leave early and watch her after 3 or my fiance will have to leave her job to watch our child. I need my overtime for us to make it, my hourly wage is a drop in the bucket otherwise.

My question to you all is simply, what should i do? 

Is there a job where i can work less and make more? I have a bachelors in communication:advertising &amp;amp; 9 years experience in Retail/Customer Service. Ideally i would work and make enough to support us both and not only sustain our current lifestyle but progress: house/savings/etc. Also if my fiance did not have to work she could get our child on the bus and off.

Where are places/what are ways we can save? Cutting costs, changing payment options, etc. 

The end goal here is for me to be able to support us comfortably with the option of my fiance working for a little extra money. We want to move into a house soon and we want to make sure that my daughter can be looked after. 

Any and all suggestions or advice would be welcome and appreciated!

Please ask questions if more information is needed/was omitted. 

Edit 1: Ideally I would change careers and keep/improve my current situation. Cutting expenses would be for the short term.

Edit 2: I make 14.50 an hour + time 1/2 overtime. 

Edit 3: I was thinking of doing an update. I have refinanced my car loan, cut the interest rate in half and extended the loan 2 years with no penalty to pay early. I'm saving $50 there. 

My fiancé got a new job! She's able to pay daycare and help a bit now. She just finished her first week. 

I cut the food bill to roughly $170 per week instead of 200. 

After this initial adjustment period, I'd say a month, we should be fairly comfortable.

I obviously need a plan for how to pay for the remaining 7 or 8 months of school before I can begin working full time.

My financial aid will cover tuition and fees for the next semester, I actually expect a $700 refund once that is disbursed.  I'm also expecting a nice tax refund in 2015.  I made $30K over an 7 month internship this year, about 30% of which was taken out for taxes.  Still, I'll be out of money soon and borrowing from family isn't an option.  Working part time would also be pretty rough, I'm barely keeping my head above water with class as is.

Below I've listed some information that might help anyone seeking to give me advice.

* Student Studying Mechanical Engineering in NC (Job Prospects After Graduation: Pretty good, though no offers yet.)
* $4000 in savings
* $19000 Debt in Federal Student Loans
* Credit Card, $0 Balance, $500 Limit, Credit Union 
* Credit Score 710


September Spending

* Food: $400
* Rent and Utilities: $320
* Gas: $100
* Shopping $100
* School Supplies: $75
* Recreation: $50
* Misc. $100

Total = ~$1200

I realize I could cut back on my spending, but the fact of the matter is that I'll be out of money before next May.  I was thinking of getting a private student loan to help out, maybe $5000 or so.

personalfinance,Please help to critique my personal investment policy,"Hi, My wife and I are both 37, and we have two children. We have a solid emergency fund and no debt except for our primary residence. I've read quite a few books over the past couple months and finally wrote down our investment policy statement. Most of this plan has been in place for some time, just never written down. Please help to critique it. The template I used is from the book: The Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning. 

Investment Philosophy: We would like a well-diversified, moderately aggressive portfolio with minimal cost for each asset class we invest in. We will manage it ourselves. We hope to be financially independent in 13 years, when we are both 50.
   
How Much to Invest:  
Tax Advantaged Accounts  
First, we will maximize our use of tax advantaged accounts. Currently this includes a Roth-401K and a I-401K. We will contribute the maximum employee sponsored amount for each plan, which is currently $17,500/yr/plan. In addition, we will take advantage of employer matching. For the Roth-401K this is 3%. For the I-401K we will match up to 200% as our business revenue permits.  
  
Taxable Accounts  
Second, we will invest $150,000 into mutual funds in a taxable account. Any remaining money will be used to pay down the mortgage on our primary residence.  
  
529 Accounts  
Third, we will invest $5,000/yr into two 529 plans until they are fully funded. One for each child.  
  
What to Invest in:  
Tax Advantaged Accounts  
The time horizon for these funds is currently 22 years. We will invest in 100% equities until the age of 40, at which time we will move 2% to bonds per year. The allocation will be as follows:  
60% U.S. total stock market  
20% U.S. small cap  
20% International total stock market  
  
529 Accounts  
The time horizon for these funds is currently 11 &amp; 14 years. We will invest in 100% equities until the children are age 12, at which time we will move 10% to bonds per year. The allocation will be as follows:  
60% U.S. total stock market  
20% U.S. small cap  
20% International total stock market  
  
Taxable Accounts  
The time horizon for these funds is currently 13 years. The allocations will be as follows:  
50% U.S. total stock market  
15% International total stock market  
25% Federal Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Bonds  
10% California Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Bonds  
  
Rebalancing:   
We will review the allocations quarterly and rebalance when a particular asset is greater than 5% from the target. For taxable accounts, rebalancing will be accomplished through purchasing when possible.  
  
Reviewing This Statement:  
This statement will be reviewed annually. If there are no substantial changes in our financial situation, any changes to allocations will not be implemented for 3 months.",finance,1413256869

I have ~$75k in student loans ($60k @ 3%; $15k @ 1.6%; Both Fixed and ~350 months left to pay).  My assumption is that I should just be paying the minimum payment due to the low interest rate, however I wanted to confirm (350 x $550 a month in payments equals ~$192k..., but I think investing in Roth IRA will payoff more in the long run).

Also, since I haven't touched the loans since 2005 I was wondering if there are any programs to further reduce interest rate? (likely already at the low end).

Thanks!

personalfinance,Didn't keep up with paying off credit card with work expense reimbursements and now I'm bumping up against my $5k limit. Could use some advice.,"First of all yes I know I'm an idiot. About three years ago it got a (purposely) low limit credit card through my bank because my new co workers went on and on about taking advantage of how often we travel for our job and using the expenses to ""rack up miles"". 

It was my first credit card in my name alone and I guess I wasn't ready for the responsibility. I'd charge about ~$800 a week, 1-2 weeks each month, file for reimbursement and get the money back the next pay period. After six months or so I was hit with an obsession with building my emergency fund (money market account earning me a whopping $0.10 a month) and started skimming off my reimbursements and carrying a balance on the card. 

Two years later and here's my situation. 

-~$4,500 balance on the card. I got promoted, hit a busy season and travel turned into 2-3 weeks out of the month. 
-~$2,000 in pending reimbursements. Three straight week of travel, $900 of that I'll see in tomorrow's paycheck, the rest on November 1. 
-~$3000 in emergency fund.
-the other $2.5k on the card is what I skimmed (from myself because I'm an idiot). About $2k of it was in my emergency fund until about a month ago when I had an emergency car engine repair. 

Other stats:
-25 y/o
-Take home is 1500 every two weeks if I continue to max out my 401k, could up to 1800 if I reduce withholding. 
-only other debt is $2000 in federal loans I'm making regular payments on 
-all bills are covered by a direct deposit of $700 to my bill account every paycheck. 
-expenses are another $350 (food/entertainment/misc)
-rest goes into savings or toward regular card payments

So what do I do here? It goes without saying that all future reimbursements go straight to the card, my problem is that it's another $800 in work expenses this week and I only have $500 available on the card.

 I know carrying such a high balance is borking my credit and I want to deal with it as fast as possible. Do I dump the rest of my savings into the card to lower the balance? Stop withholding and cut all non required expenses and try to throw a few hundred at it every paycheck?

I am single and living with friends I graduated with out of financial necessity (parents moved out of state when I graduated). My expenses are ~700 a month on rent, 350 between car insurance, cell phone, Netflix, other silly expenses. About 200 a month on food (I cook). Overall about 40% of my check goes to this, and the rest is up in the air. (Approx 1.6k per month). 

I feel as though I am limited because I got my job almost solely due to being an EMT and 1 year experience doing IT things and my degree seemed dead end and I got a way better job than expected. 

I work 7-3 mo-fri. My goal is to go back to community college to get an associates in engineering (preferably electrical) as this was always a dream of mine and I think it could propel my career. 

So reddit .. Any tips? Should I work and begin paying off my roughly 22k in federal student loans? Or kill myself working full time and going to class in the evenings?

personalfinance,"Looking at an amazing housing deal, but have no savings or credit","Okay guys, so I'm in a bit of a tight spot financially.

I'm a student making a *decent* amount of money from a part-time job. I need to move out some time shortly because to sum it up nobody in my family is super well off financially and I hate being such a big burden on them. Also, my girlfriend and I would like to move in together for a lot of obvious reasons.

Shortly, I'm gonna be moving up to a new job. Depending on which of the four I'm looking at I get, it'll be somewhere between $11-$20/hr, about 20 hours a week (for now coming out to about $850-$1600/mo, probably reduced to about $700-$1400 after I'm independant with taxes and all)

Looking at rent in my area, if I was to rent in a shitty area not far from my college I'd be looking at $400/mo plus utilities, minimum.

Looking at housing in my area, I just dug around and found myself a lot of interesting options:

* A 4 bedroom for around a thousand dollars total. Holy shit is that a low price, but considering the area it's most likely a run down crack house and I'm pretty sure I'd get axe murdered in my first week there. I could buy this in a month up front

* A 3 bedroom built within the last 50 years, for around 35k. Assuming I could make no down payment and got a higher than average interest rate (avg is 4.08, I calc'ed with 4.58), my monthly payment would be roughly $179. It's not in great shape but considering it's more recent that might save me some worries about the electrical wiring. In a good neighborhood

* A 3 bedroom built during WWII, for around 50k. Definitely the best looking of the of the options to me, it's in decent looking shape and would need some (but not anywhere near as much) work. Assuming the whole no-down-payment, high interest rate again, I'd be paying roughly $192 a month. Solid neighborhood

For obvious reasons, these lower monthly prices coupled with the idea of actually having a house and not living in a run down apartment are attractive to me. I would love to be able to lock in a decent rate on a home before the rates go up. However, I don't really have any savings yet and my credit history is limited.

I'm aware that I can get someone to co-sign a loan for me, but what can I do about the down payment? It would take me a long time to save up 20% down for a house, and by the time that happened these homes will probably be sold and interest rates will have gone up. Is it possible to get a loan that wouldn't require me to have a down payment?

Edit: the costs of living independently would be somewhat balanced by having me girlfriend cover costs with me and possibly getting another roommate too. Hell, if money got really tight it could be us plus two housemates since we have three bedrooms

Assuming she has several private loans, is it worth looking at loan consolidation to try and lower her monthly payments? If so are there any reputable lenders which deal with this sort of thing? I'm pretty new to the US so I don't know who to look up.

Also I've heard of tuition.io as a tool to help keep track of all the loans, would you folks at PF reccomend it?


Any help is greatly appreciated. 


**EDIT: (Loan breakdown update)**


So it looks like I both underestimated how much she would make in a year **and** the amount that she borrowed to go to college. As she works freelance work is pretty unpredictable, but we took a look at her current work schedule and it looks like averaged over the course of a year she is set to make closer to **$35k/pa** . 

Loan Breakdown below. I've rounded the numbers to the nearest 10. For the private loans I know she has some outstanding interest payments but I'm not entirely sure what they are.

**Federal Loans**


Type | Interest Rate | Current Principal | Accrued Interest (uncapitalized) 
------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------
Direct Stafford Unsubsidized| 5.41%|$20,500|$700

Stafford Unsubsidized | 6.8% | $1,850 | $550
Stafford Subsidized  | 5.6% | $3,470 | $0
**Total** | N/A | **~$72,500** | **$3,380**



**Private Loans**


Interest Rate | Current Principal
---------------|-------------------
2.25% | $7,740
7.5% | $7,030
2.25% | $3,580
6% | $5,680
2.75% | $7,330
7.25% | $9,150



**Total Private : ~$40,400**


**Total Debt : ~$113,000**



We are going to try and apply for the 'Pay As you Earn' repayment plan for her federal loans (It looks to be similar to IBR but the payment term is 20 years instead of 25 and the payment amount is %10 of discretionary income instead of %15, unfortunately the forgiven amount is still classed as taxable income however I figure I'll be able to save for the tax bill if she can manage the loans) but we have a few questions:

1. With Pay as you earn/ IBR are you allowed to target individual loans with extra payments? (e.g. attempt to hit the high interest ~2k loans with any extra cash)? Would there be a benefit to this? We are pretty sure that by 20 years she won't be able to pay the full amount anyway.

2. Her loans are currently in a grace period after graduating, is it worth attempting to pay the outstanding interest on her loans (~3k for her federal loans), from her savings? Or should we just wait for the repayment period to start and ensure that she is on IBR/Pay as you Earn.

3. Her private loan rates look to be okay, (not the 9-12% that I've heard of). Would it be worth investigating into consolidating these into one payment? 

4. My plan for her at the moment is get onto IBR/Pay as you Earn and then only pay the minimum payment towards her federal loans (aiming for them to be forgiven by the end of the 20 year term), and to hit her private loans with as much as possible using the snowball method. I know that she would end up paying more that way, but she is the type of person who needs to be able to aim for a goal and I think the boost of being able to say that she paid off one of her loans entirely would really help.

5. Some time down the road we might want to get married. She mentioned that it might make her loan payments go up and assuming I keep my job It might mean she would no longer be eligible for IBR/Pay as you Earn. Is this true? What would our options be at that point?

I am 22 y/o who just finished undergrad and grad school over the last 5 years. Unfortunately, I'm terrible about knowing what is best when it comes to my loans. I get completely overwhelmed whenever I try to figure them out.


I have several federal loans (totaling about 91k including current interest), as well as 3 private loans from Wells Fargo (totaling about 65k including current interest), all with varying interest rates. 


I need to know--[should I consolidate my private loans?](https://www.wellsfargo.com/student/private-loan-consolidation/) My grace period ends in February, and it says that consolidation leads to immediate repayment. If I do consolidate, do I wait until later or should I do that sooner?


Also, which of these loans should I be focusing paying off first? Should I focus on the interest itself primarily? I just got a job that should get me an annual salary of $65k, which I will be starting within the next couple of weeks, so you all have an idea of what I'm working with.

Which repayment option would you recommend, given my situation?

personalfinance,Too good to be true? Offered $5/month for Rehab on $6k defaulted fed. student loan..,"So, I got a job recently where I don't want my wages garnished. I call up the collection agency assigned to my account by the US dept. of Education, full expecting to pay $100-120/month but hoping to talk them down to $80 or so.

They offer me Rehab program. Where, they say my debt will be taken out of default after 9 concurrent payments of $5/month. I was shocked, sounded to good to be true. ""Is that the fee on top of what I got to pay or..?"" I asked. Guy assures me thats the entire bill. ""Will it go up from there after I finish those first 9 months?."" He replies with something along the lines of ""We aren't out to get you, based on what you make ($8/hr 35 hr a week) that payment would remain sufficent unless I went over $25k/yr. Well, okay. Sounds great. Sign me up. I was also assured that after my first payment has been processed, I won't have to worry about wage garnishment any longer during the ""rehab"" program.

Quick math makes it sound too good to be true.. @ $5/month it would take me 100 years to pay off the debt, not including interest or other fees. So, I would die before it is paid. @ such a low rate, thats fine with me though.

Just can't get past the insanely low offer. Browsing around online it seems most people pay at least $100/month.

**EDITORIAL:**

* All eyes on Hinkley

The European Commission's decision that the revised UK support package for EDF's Hinkley Point C nuclear project is compatible with EU state aid rules does not necessarily provide an easy blueprint for subsequent projects. Other EU nuclear project sponsors and investors face a number of difficult issues that should be at the heart of planning for subsequent projects, write George Borovas, Nick Buckworth and James Webber.

The Commission found that although the UK's deal with EDF included state aid, such aid was permissible. This was particularly so given the need to support private financing for a project of such ""unprecedented nature and scale.""

Even so, the Commission tightened the economics of the project considerably. As a condition for its clearance, the Commission required EDF to pay higher fees for a state guarantee that will be provided to support the debt incurred constructing the plant, as well as mandating that any profits over the level originally anticipated are shared more generously with consumers than had been proposed in the UK's original deal with EDF.

To give some background, I graduated from college in 2008. I immediately moved from MA to NYC where I worked and earned a graduate degree (at my own expense). I am now living back in MA after 6 years of fun and carefree financial decisions.

I've been back in MA for about 6 months. I've become mature enough only within the last year to begin confronting my debt and bad financial habits. I've actually made a huge amount of progress in 2014, paying off about $6k of cc debt and saving $5,600 ($3k was contributed to a side business that I've started in September which is on the way to becoming profitable. I'll begin taking home $200- $500/month in compensation starting in December). All while leasing a new car and incurring hefty moving expenses.

My credit card debt will be wiped out in November. I'd like to build up an emergency fund of $15,600 which will cover 6 months of living expenses including student loans (but minus any entertainment/iced coffees etc). The amount of time this takes will vary with my income.

Right now I'm taking home a minimum of $3100/month. Can I qualify for a mortgage or FHA loan? How do I calculate my debt to income ratio and what ratio is typically required to qualify?


It kills me to pay rent each month instead of owning, but unfortunately It's not possible for me to live rent free. I'd really like to purchase a home for ~250k once my emergency fund is in order.

Any input or advice is welcome. I love this sub and it's been fantastic to educate and empower myself financially over the last few weeks. I appreciate everyone's brutal honesty.

personalfinance,Credit Card Advice - Cash back worth the interest rate?,"I'm wondering if I should accept an offer with my credit card company. 
I currently have a $2000 limit with an 11% interest rate. I have an offer for 1.5% cash back on all purchases, and after one year, my interest rate would go to a variable 22%. The one appealing part of the offer is that my credit limit would go up after five months of on-time payments. 

I've had the same credit card for the past six years, and it is my only credit card. I'm 28. I only use it for planned purchases, and pay it off at the end of every month. I have a good credit score for someone my age. 

I'd like to increase my credit limit (simply for the purposes of raising my credit score). I don't plan on using the card anymore than I already do - I currently have it set to automatically pay some bills. 

My main question is whether or not it is worth it to accept this offer. While cash back and a higher credit limit seems appealing, the interest rate seems not to be worth it. I don't have an emergency fund saved up yet (I'm getting on my feet as I'm slowly paying off my student loans, which has so far been going well.) Thoughts?

Bitcoin,BitLendingClub,"Hi All

A couple of weeks ago I saw the above site named on here and several people were asking questions about. I have signed signed up and started using it and thought would leave a review for you all.

Currently I am using it for the investor side (you can seek loans yourself if wanted/needed).

So far the whole process has been flawless.

You get a random generated btc address to send to your account, once there you can then look through those looking for investment. This can range from some looking for 0.01 to 20-30btc. You can either part fund if you don't have the full funds or if you do have the full funds you can fund them 100% yourself.

Once you have decided you can then set your interest rate at WHAT YOU WANT! This I thought is great and it works out APR automatically of your interest rate. So far mine have ranged from 5%-20%. 

Once you have made your offer this goes to the person seeking the loan for their approval.

BitLending do take a fee however this is not deducted from the investor fee but instead a fee on top so we keep out cut.

Each offered investment ranges from 1 day loan period to a year being the max I have seen.

My biggest issue was how to tell those who are trustworthy to pay back. This is done in three different ways.

1) You are able to see how many loans the person has had previously and if they were paid back on time
2) There is also a 'ebay style' feedback system with a plus feedback or negative.
3) Each individual investment screen has space at the bottom for you to contact the person seeking the loan with any questions you may have

Like I say I have only used this for two days but I am blown away with how easy and simple it is and already had some people pay back their loans early.

If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask!

Should you accept money from your parents?
Credit
I read a few posts lately about generational wealth transfer, and now that I am in my mid 30s, I still have friends around who think nothing of having their parents pay their rent (“but I HAVE to live in a 2 bed place, and I can’t afford it!”), cell phone plan (“but it’s cheaper because it is a family plan”), or any other splurge (“they paid for my ticket to Bali otherwise I couldn’t have gone”).

My case is pretty different. I left home at 17, paid my way through college and have never received more than a little cash for birthdays from my parents. My mum paid for a one week holiday once, and when she came to Guatemala with my sister she also paid for our expenses. When I am in Paris I do stay with her and expect to be fed and pay no rent, which averages a couple of weeks per year over the past 15 years. She is a primary school teacher who gives a ton of private tutoring classes after school so she can save enough for retirement as she stopped working for 15 years to raise two daughters. So she has cash but doesn’t spend on herself much, and when she asks me if I need money, or if she would like me to pay for a treat I am talking about at the time (new laptop, flight ticket…), I always say thanks, but no way.

I couldn’t possibly accept her money as she works 60 hour weeks so I could go on holidays! Plus I don’t need it in the first place, but if I had a hard working parent and was in need, I’d try to hustle as they do before asking for help. She did lend me money several times so I could snatch an investment opportunity without having to go to the bank, and I repaid her every time, with a 4% interest that was favorable to both parties, as her savings account gave her 1.5%.

The only way I feel conflicted about accepting money from her is I know she will leave a lot of cash behind as she spends close to nothing, and that will be heavily taxed by the French government, so I’d rather enjoy her tax-free money today than give half to the state when she passes.

Does it change anything when your parents are loaded? I guess the guilt wears off as it “costs” them less effort and % of their net worth to pass on their wealth to you.

My opinion on that is often, the trade-off for giving you money monthly, when paying part of your rent or utility bills is that you have to see them once a week, or holiday with them in summer. Remember Gilmore Girls when they had to have dinner once a week with the grandparents or they would stop paying college tuition at Yale?

That puts you in a beggar’s position. I have seen parents give money to their adult kids every time they visit. So are you really going because you genuinely enjoy your parents’ company or you need cash?

Parents, you are not doing your kids any favors by doing that. You are maintaining them in an artificial lifestyle they could not afford on their own, only resulting in them never having the urge to earn enough to deserve such lifestyle and becoming lazy entitled adults.

We never received cash from my grandparents, but every year, they would take the whole family somewhere nice, for a week long holiday. All 20 of us in a 5 star hotel must have cost a pretty penny, but I would rather have the memories of those fabulous holidays, than an inheritance in the bank and no family memories. When we would visit, the table was always full of good food and expensive wines. Yet the only thing they paid for their adult children was an education. No downpayment, no car, they assumed that once you had a good set of skills, you were good to go.

 

So for me, it is a strong NO on financing splurges, or receiving monthly money to live an inflated lifestyle and pretend you earned it. However, looking at the tax benefit of passing on wealth to your kids as you are alive, I’d be willing to accept a downpayment, or parents funding my kids’ college fund, or a stock portfolio. Not money to blow up, but money that will otherwise be partially confiscated by the state, as a bitter thank you for all their years of hard work and diligent saving. I would like my mother to die penniless, having passed all her estate to her daughters, while we would cover her health expenses in her last years. I think it is also kind of nice that your parents help you buy your forever home while you are young, so you can have memories with them in the home, instead of having to move every time you add a child to the family.

 

What do you think? Are you a young adult still accepting money from the bank of mum and dad? Where do you draw the line between spoiling and assisting?",finance,1413365527
investing,7 Factors to Understand Gold Prices,"7 Factors to Understand Gold Prices
 published on http://gold-prediction.com/2014/08/10/gold-news-7-key-factors-influence-gold-prices/
Understanding the true value of gold has always been a difficult task to achieve, as several factors wield influence on gold prices. Ben Bernanke, former chairman of America’s Federal Reserve, even told Congress in 2013 that “No one really understands gold prices,” and added afterwards that he didn’t get it either.
Here are 7 key factors that can help you understand gold prices better:
1- Inflation: Gold may perform especially well when inflation is high. For instance, over the past 45 years the average 12-month correlation between gold prices and the US consumer price index is 0.
2- Interest rates: The higher the interest rates, the less attractive it is to buy gold. Indeed, as owning gold doesn’t pay any interest rate, you loose the money of your investment when you could have earned interest on it. Yet, there is no constant relationship between gold prices and interest rates, they may move in opposite direction or rise and fall together.
3- Stock markets: Owning gold often helps having a balanced portfolio. Gold prices and the S&amp;P 500 index show an average “12-month correlation over the past 45 years.
4- Geopolitics: Gold investors are now closely following geopolitical developments in Iraq and in Ukraine, as gold is considered a safe haven in time of uncertainty. For instance gold peaked in 1980 at $850 an ounce when the USSR invaded Afghanistan, around the same time as the hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran. More recently in 2011, during the Arab Spring and the Euro crisis, gold peaked at $1,920 an ounce.
5- The dollar: A weaker dollar often means higher gold prices: it is not the value of gold that is going up, but rather the value of the dollar that is going down. But over long periods of time the value of gold may also change in other currencies: gold has gained 273% for British investors against 255% for US ones over the past 10 years.
6- Oil prices: Gold and crude oil prices move in the same direction 60% of the time. But not necessarily at the same speed : over the past 10 years gold gains have increased by 235% against 140% for oil.
7- Asian demand: Asian demand tends to follow gold prices rather than setting them. For example, as gold prices fell by 30% in 2013 against all major currencies, including the yuan, the China Gold Association reported last July that the gold demand was down 19% and that demand for gold bars fell 62% since January.",finance,1413365595

personalfinance,Taxes for 1099(contract) worker. Single in California,"Hi all,

I'm currently looking into doing some contract work as a software engineer. I've been talking to a company lately and they want to offer me X amount of money per hour. I want to figure out what kind of taxes I'll expect to pay before I decide if I want the job.

I understand as a 1099 employee I need to pay my social security as well as the employer's so that would be 6.2%+6.2%=12.4%. Also I'd need to pay my share of the medicare as well as their share, so 1.45%+1.45%=2.9%

So my federal taxes will be at 15.3% plus whatever tax bracket I end up in for my income.

I pulled this information off http://smallbusiness.chron.com/estimate-taxes-due-contract-work-21081.html so please let me know if it's wrong.

Aside from this, is my state tax affected by being a 1099 employee as opposed to a w-2? I couldn't find much information online that I could make sense of as a PF newb.

Furthermore, I understand that as a contractor I'll need to pay for health insurance and wont get 401k matching so that will cut out a good chunk of cash for me... anything else I haven't thought about that will cut into my cash flow?

And lastly, as a self-employed contractor, are there any tax benefits I could take advantage of that could alleviate my tax requirements?

I've been reading The Bogleheads Guide to Investing, went through Dave Ramsay's FPU, and have been reading the posts on this subreddit. I've been getting some mixed messages. It seems like the general consensus isthat it is best to keep my emergency fund in a Money Market Fund instead of just my regular savings account that I have with USAA. So I just called an advisor at Vanguard about setting up a money market fund and he advised against it. He said it would get a better interest rate in my savings account. Now I'm just confused.

personalfinance,Saving advice for grad student on scholarship,"Two questions:

1) Given my circumstances, how large should my emergency fund be?

2) What should I do with this spare $7,000?

I'm a PhD student in the humanities in year one of a six-year course. My university is in New York and gives me enough money to be able to save around $300 a month, which is about 15% of the stipend.

I also have around $7,000 of savings from my old job left over after my moving expenses are accounted for. It's just sitting in my checking account. This is on top of $5,000 earmarked for my emergency fund.

I don't get paid over the summer, but I plan on moving back to Europe in the summertime (where I am from), where I can stay for free for about 3 months of the year. I do not think it will be a problem breaking my lease, as the building manager already mentioned that when people leave early, it's better they come see him to give back the apartment than take off in the night. Flights are about $300 each way and I have already saved for them (category in YNAB).

Given that my income is basically guaranteed for the next six years (and I also have full health insurance), how large should my emergency fund be? I spend about $1,900 a month. I anticipate my tax burden this year will be small, as I will only have US income (of around $15,000) for this tax year.

I already have $5,000 set aside for my emergency fund in my European account, which I access through an international credit card with no foreign transaction fees. This money makes sense for me as an emergency fund because if I use it day-to-day my budget becomes vulnerable to the fluxes of the exchange rate.

I am getting an American credit card because I have no credit history in the US—so that's being taken care of. I tried to open a savings account with Ally but they rejected my application because they couldn't verify my identity (but I have an SSN).

I plan on an academic career, but I don't where it will be. It seems foolish to me to put that $7,000 extra into a retirement account because I may want it for a deposit, moving costs after my degree, etc. What's the best way to put it away for six years? Realistically, I know I should prepare for the possibility of adjuncting for a couple of years.

I've been reading about low-cost mutual funds, ETFs, Vanguard, etc. for about the last year but the uncertainty in my living situation (waiting to hear about grad school) stopped me from making any determined moves with this money.

I'm especially keen to hear from people who are a few years out of grad school, and what they ended up using lump sums of money for.

I have no compelling debt. By this I mean I have a UK student finance debt which has some tiny interest rate, is only paid back on amounts earned over a certain threshold, and gets written off after 15 or 20 years. I have no vehicle.",finance,1413392016

Anyway, I'll make this as brief and detailed as I can. I am twenty one years old, currently NOT a student in the US*, and am working four jobs in order to make significant dents in my student loans from the last few years. 

I managed to accrue one $15,000 and one $5,000 loan that have held me back for quite some time now due to the ridiculous interest rates. 

I live at home with my family and they do help with paying it but the interest rate is very high and it feels like we're just sinking money into a bottomless hole. Another thing is that i'm sure you all know that life happens, and whether it's the transmission going on my dads car, my sister's school expenses or family emergencies it means that not all of our attention can be focused on this 100% of the time no matter how much we want it to be. 

I've thought about potentially looking for other loans with lower interest rates in order to cover these two but have absolutely no idea how to even look for something like that. I'm an avid reader of this sub and can't wait to start saving and investing the money i'm working hard to earn but these loans are keeping me in financial limbo and I'm just hoping some of you have advice on how to rid myself of these burdens - whether it's a practice that worked for you or a government program or another loan with lower interest rate.

I've called the finance company and they will not allow me to go back on a payment plan, they require full payment of $4,400 by November 3 this is the only way I can get my car back. I can't ask friends or family for help I don't think anyone would do that for me anyways.

I'm a troubled person have been dealing with personal issues for some time, currently being treated for pretty serious depression and other chronic health ailments. I have some medical debt as well from a week stay in the hospital earlier this year.

My income is about 450-500 a week working from home selling items on eBay. I was simply irresponsible and I know it's my own fault, I did have the money to make payments but I have other expenses too. There's no good reason I didn't pay my bills, I don't gamble or do drugs I just manage my finances poorly and always have, really. 

When I got this car I wasn't told the interest rate until after I had already signed for it. The interest was 20%(!) I was paying almost as much in interest a month as I was towards the principal, due to unestablished credit. Had I known they would charge me 20% interest before I don't think I would have gone through with it but I had already put down $400 to hold the car so I felt locked in at that point.

I've been working hard all morning getting items listed on eBay but it would take a small miracle for me to earn $4,400 in just about 2-3 weeks.

I'm wondering what words of advice or wisdom this forum could impart on me. I feel absolutely terrible and guilty I just didn't make the damn payments. I know it's my own fault, I just wish I hadn't neglected this debt.

personalfinance,Is refinancing my student loans a no-brainer?,"Ahoy, 

I graduated from a private college in 2011 with an absurd amount of debt.  3 years later, I have been making monthly payments of $837 without ever missing a payment.  I still have a total $67,637 to pay back between 3 private loan companies and federal loans.  The interest rates all hover around 5.5-7.7% for the private loans; I'm not too concerned about the federal loans.  Money has been really tight but such as life.

Next year I will be going to graduate school which will result in a substantial decrease in take home pay.  It is unlikely that I will be able to continue paying $837 a month and the loans will go into deferment.  Meanwhile the interest accrued throughout graduate school will eradicate all progress I have made thus far on the loans.

Cue in Credit Karma.  Just signed up the other day.  Turns out my credit score is pretty awesome at 768 and on the recommendations tab they say I should refinance all my loans (both private and federal) through a company called SoFi to get a variable interest rate of 3.16 to 5.16%, reduce my monthly payment to $472, and save over $10,000 over the life time of the loan.

So here I am feeling like a schmuck for not looking into options like this earlier.  I think that I would be able to make the payments of $472/month throughout grad school and in the mean time I can take the extra money to build up a legitimate buffer and maybe a grad school start-up fund.  

Am I missing out on something here?  Should I sign up for this immediately?  Does anyone have any experience with SoFi?  

For salary reference I make ~$41K before taxes now and in grad school will make somewhere between $28.5-$32K before taxes.  Cost of living will likely go up as well but I haven't actually applied yet so I don't know where exactly I will be going.  First choice is San Francisco though... rent is scary over there.

investing,I thought I'd share a comment that had some positive feedback. Hopefully it sparks an interesting discussion!,"This was in response to the comment: ""For a 50% loss something catastrophic has to happen, nothing has so far. I'm not an economist at all, but my guess is we end this year flat or slightly up, we might go sideways, I don't think we will go much lower than this.""

Let's start with macroeconomic pressures.

*  EU, led by the periphery nations (which have been in depression-like or near depression-like scenarios for years) and now by the core nations like Germany and France, is slowing and it looks like the ECB will not act sufficiently to stop this. This is exacerbated by sanctions.
*  The emerging world is slowing their growth. Not necessarily as a global recession, but the IMF has reduced its global growth forecasts each year, and this year looks to have even lower growth forecasts than last year.
*  Disinflationary pressures in the US are building. You can tell by the TIPS spread as well as the extraordinary strength of government debt in the face of potentially rising rates that bond markets believe that inflation and growth will be below expectations and the Fed targets in the next few years. Expectations of future inflation 5 years down the line are also dropping below Fed targets, signalling that disinflationary pressures might mean inflation expectations are not as well anchored as the Fed thinks- only to the downside, not the upside.
*  Zero Lower Bound. If we have disinflation, the Fed may actually be out of tools, unless they implement QE4. However, there is a tremendous, TREMENDOUS amount of both internal pressure (fatigue of ""QE infinity"" and the Jeremy Stein wing of the Fed are working with the hawkish wing to fight against more QE as well as a HUGE desire to normalize rates eventually) and external pressure (more QE would be dramatically unpopular and might jeopardize the independence of the Fed) may prevent unconventional policy responses unless the US actually sinks into a recession, at which point it will be too late.
*  Forecasters have consistently been too bullish on the American economy for the past 5 years. The past 5 years has been a consistent pattern of the Fed, IMF, and private forecasters giving rosy predictions of GDP and then revising it downwards. This has continued- the IMF, Fed, and many private forecasters have, once again, downgraded their forecasts for US 2014 GDP, and some have also downgraded US 2015 GDP expectations.

So, that's a concerning macroeconomic picture. Let me now put on my other hat, and show you why I think the financial system is not as healthy as you think it is.

*  Let's start with corporations. There has been more junk bond issuance than ever before. Corporate debt exceeds the pre-2008 peak. Corporate cash piles are incredibly concentrated in certain mega-cap corporations, and so corporations tend to fall into either the super-large-refuse-to-spend-cash-piles type, or all of the other ones that are leveraging up to the hilt with cheap junk debt. If anything happens to either rates (going higher) or to liquidity (banks lending less, less search for yield, tightening lending standards), a lot of high yield issuers are going to go under when they can't refinance. This is exacerbated by most AAA or other high investment grade companies issuing debt because they'd rather lever up than keep their investment grade rating because there isn't much of a yield benefit right now to being AAA.
*  Mortgage debt may have dropped, but other consumer debt has risen, and total consumer debt is comparable to where it was pre-2008... just with less in housing and more in other places. This is very concerning to me, because it means that if there were to be another crisis from some area, consumer spending would plummet, leading to a cycle of bad things.
*  Bond liquidity has dropped due to regulation (Volcker rule, risk retention, risk-based-capital-cushion requirements), meaning instead of banks buying and selling bonds when retail investors panic and flee high yield (as happened historically before 2008, where it didn't happen because banks were the focus of the crisis), there will be no one to buy when retail investors panic as they sometimes do. This is exacerbated by the structure of high yield mutual funds and ETFs, which trade with a ton of liquidity, but their underlying asset does not have much liquidity, which can lead to redemption problems in case of a panic out of high yield debt.
*  Stock prices are incredibly overvalued from a normalized historical record via market cap to GDP, Shiller P/E, P/peak E, P/trend E, Tobin's Q, and dividend yield. I've mentioned this at length in this sub before. [Please see this graph as the TL;DR. It shows market cap to GDP v. expected stock returns over the next 10 years. Right now, stocks are priced to return between 0 and 2% annually over the next 10 years... after dividends.](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc140421a.png)
*  Investors are becoming more risk averse. It started with a sell off of small caps and junk bonds earlier this year, getting worse recently, as well as a sell off of foreign stocks. Now, you can see it in that the risk aversion is beginning to hit stocks as a whole- everything except mega caps. This is a classic signal that investors are getting more and more risk averse, which can lead to margin compression. Regardless of the macroeconomic foundation, margin expansion can lead to higher stock prices even when the economy shrinks, and margin compression can lead to lower stock prices even when the economy grows. If risk aversion continues unabated, it will hit even mega cap stocks, and there will be nowhere in stocks to hide.

There are other concerning things. It's concerning that real estate cap rates are near all time lows. It's concerning that junk stuff is getting securitized into mortgage backed securities again, although not quite as bad as in 2007. It's concerning that covenant quality in bonds across the board has dropped, and investors are giving up basic protections (like recourse in cases of fraud or violation of reps and warranties!) in order to issue bonds.

TL;DR: Current asset prices around the world are like a powder keg. I can't guarantee that this sell off represents the broader shift towards risk aversion that will light that keg, but it's a possibility, and if it goes it will be worse than anyone on /r/investing is predicting, likely on the order of 2000-2002.",finance,1413419094
personalfinance,Consolidating on Student Loans?,"I have a handful of student loans, both Private and Federal. Four are with SallieMae/Navient the other is with OSLA. They are as follows

For the past few years. I've only been paying the minimum payment on all these loans, because I couldn't afford to pay more. I even had to defer a few loans because I was out of a job last year. I finally have a solid full time job and will be making 40K a year. I'm on time with all of my bills, my credit score is ok, and I'm looking to start a 401K within the coming months. 

I've had these loans since 08'-09' and I just want to do away with them once and for all. I asked SallieMae/Navient about consolidating my student loans and they said I would have to talk to a bank about refinancing. I am with Chase and another small credit union. The credit union is where my main accounts are, and I've been with them since 2004, not sure if that makes a difference. 

I'm wondering if it's even worth it to try and refinance my loans or should I just pay the lender directly? Also, how much should I be putting toward these loans?

Currently all my bills and expenses not including the student loans comes out to roughly $2,202.00 a month and I bring home $2,392.00 a month.

personalfinance,Some questions about financing a new/used car,"First of all, I tried searching but the Reddit search feature is terrible and what I found didn't really clarify my situation much.

Okay, so I recently got a job that pays well enough and, with my budgets, will allow me to actually afford a reasonable payment on a car... but I have terrible credit.

Young me was stupid, so that's all we need to delve into there.

So I currently drive a 2003 Hyundai Tiburon that I am making payments on through a tiny place in my old hometown that did in-house financing. My payments there are $275/month. The car is falling apart, however. The engine has recently started knocking (yes, it's got plenty of oil), the back shocks/struts need replaced at the very least, probably needs it all around, I think the frame of the car is rusting to pieces (the fuel/brake lines were recently replaced because they were literally rotting away and burst).

Originally with the car there was a roughly $700 finance charge that was just added onto the price of the car (18 month financing) and I was not able to keep up with the $275 payments early on so there is going to be an additional cost on top of the $1,500 that I still owe once I get to the point that I can pay it off. Between the payments and the shit that keeps going wrong with the car I can't see the benefit of keeping it because it would cost thousands to fix.

----------

So that was my situation... here are my questions:

* I have bad credit, but a good job. Can I go into negotiations like a hardass and land a reasonable APR? Or is that pretty much set in stone based on my credit?
* I still owe on the car... does that pretty much put me in the situation where I *have* to trade it in? Or are there other options?
* I have access to a federal credit union through the county board of education that I work. I have no idea how that works, though.
* Are there any options that I am missing?

------
[Edit]

Budget stuff:

Gross pay should be around $1800 every 2 weeks, so I think I should pocket about $1300-1400 of that.

* Rent - $475/mo
* Utilities - $100
* Cable - $35
* Current car payment - $275
* Car insurance - $50
* Health/life Insurance - $90
* Groceries - $200
* Miscellaneous - $200

personalfinance,I made a web app that graphs effective / marginal tax rates vs income for each US state. Hope this might be interesting or useful for others in the sub,"I originally wanted to see a graph of how tax rates change in relation in income, and I couldn't find much outside of the pay calculators or marginal tax bracket tables. So I started building a web app that can interactively graph all the different marginal and effective tax rates for any given state.

The website for the app is at [http://taxgraphs.io](http://taxgraphs.io).

***Second Edit*** - There should be no more errors in Firefox, and you should be able to toggle no states now. I also added comparing married and single filing status in the Take Home Pay graph.

Right now there's three graphs supported:

- State Comparison: compare overall effective and marginal tax rate between states
- State Breakdown: view all individual effective and marginal tax rates for a state
- Take Home Pay: view net income amount and percent for a state 

You can hover or click on the graphs and it will show tooltips with the tax rates at that particular income level. You can also adjust the income range, animation time, and color scheme shown on the graph. The app should look and work well across desktop browsers and tablets, and still be ok but somewhat cramped on phones.

The tax data itself can be adjusted by the single / married jointly filing status and by the standard deduction for federal income. I also made sure to include Medicare, SS, and any state unemployment tax that exists. Unfortunately I am not yet deducting state taxes from the federal income tax, applying the Alternative Minimum Tax, or applying deductions for state income taxes as there's a lot of complexity I need to work on. Hopefully, the data should still be mostly accurate despite these flaws.

I also have the data and code hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hermantran/taxgraphs) if anyone wants to take a deeper look.

WOW, I AM BEYOND WORDS. I honestly DID NOT expect this will happen, but looks like Kickstart team took some time to analyze all the evidence. HUGE THANK YOU TO KICKSTARTER! You guys prevented a disaster!

Firstly, I want to thank all the people that recognized Anonabox is scam and fought with their decieving lies on Kickstarter comments, Twitter, here on Reddit. Then I would also like to thank every online media who covered this story. We couldn't do this without you guys!!!111


Hi,

You may know me from this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/2j9caq/anonabox_tor_router_box_is_false_representation/

I feel obligated to try to inform as much people as I can about the circumstances under which Anonabox is being sold and the consequences it will have.

We have proved that Anonabox guy and his twitter friends have intentionally deceived the public.

- They lied about the prototypes, saying that they invented the device while the device is bought from Aliexpress. What makes things absurd, they offered a bullshit story on how Arab Spring inspired them to create the device. Arab Spring started in 2010, so they are actually implying that the device was in the making for FOUR years, which is a blatant lie. All this to gain more sympathies from the people, thus deceiving them into backing their project!

- during AMA was the perfect opportunity for August Anonabox to come clean, to admit that he lied and everyone would forget about it. Of course, that did not happen. He continued to lie more and intentionally ignored the important questions for hours. When he replied he basically tried to ""stonewall"" people proving he is a liar and acted like he did not know about the Chinese devices.

- He finally came clean to the Wired author that in fact they are using the board from China, sourced by the company called Gainstrong. That is only about 10% of the truth, the whole device including design, board, plastic and everything was already made in China a long before August decided to “invent” Anonabox.

- Anonabox software is actually OpenWRT, which is something they did point out in logo, but intentionally withheld any actual specifications for the reason in next point. They withheld that information to BOOST SALES.

- They are intentionally misleading the public (LYING) about the device being fully open source, while it’s not. Hardware, the most important part of the device, is not open source. It’s a Chinese knockoff of TP-Link “3G routers” which opens the possibilities for a hardware backdoors in the hardware (think of Huawei backdoors). The reason why they did so is simple, nobody would buy the device in such numbers. Everyone would just build their own device.

- Their Tor package is actually The Grugq’s Portal (linked in edit above).

- OpenWRT is so BADLY configured by Anonabox team that device that is supposed to protect you is actually giving away your information. The device has BACKDOOR root password, OPEN wireless network (so anyone can connect to it) and is shipped with SSHD!!! This means that anyone can take control of the device!

- Anonabox marketing terms, pictures and prototypes are all ripped from various web sources. Wording is ripped off from UnJailPi, photos are actually just a photos of a Chinese clone, “prototypes” are well know hardware devices that are NOT invited by Anonabox.

If the above is not enough for you to back off, here’s my opinion on FAR WORSE issue that none seems to notice.

The Anonabox guy (and his helpers) are amateurs. They are offering fully secure device (and encrypted as they point out wrongfully) to people who need the anonymity. Their target group are non-tech people, journalists and whistle-blowers who are supposed to trust their LIFE to this piece of Chinese knockoff! We don't need more people ending up like Chelsea (Bradley) Manning, Snowden and many other unrecognized whistle-blowers!

The fact that the Anonabox guys continued to intentionally mislead the public, proves that they do not care about the people they are providing the device for! They just want to either steal the money with fake kickstarter and / or provide off the shelf “3G router” made in China with badly patched bunch of scripts they found online. 

Tor as every other service / application is constantly being audited for vulnerabilities, which will NOT be patched when discovered on Anonabox because 1) authors are not providing a way to update firmware 2) they do not posses the knowledge to do it!

Bottom line is, even if they deliver their device, it cannot be trusted. Of course, that's assuming Kickstarter doesn't cancel their project for breaking their TOS.

Thank you.

EDIT:

People, move on from the Arab Spring bullshit. It doesn't matter if that's how they got their idea or not. It's really disappointing to see so many people arguing and being butthurt about that instead of proving Anonabox is scam. If any of the prototypes nor final product are NOT made or designed by Anonabox, how the hell did they got inspiration from Arab Spring about it? On my other thread on /r/privacy we've proven that Anonabox RIPPED OF website text and ideas from UnJailPi. Now please stop the AS circlejerk, it's not helping anyone.

EDIT:

While I was battling with trolls I missed a update from @stevelord who got anonabox firmware. He also previously in detail inspected the Anonabox source code and discovered various misconfiguration and security issues https://twitter.com/stevelord


EDIT:

This needs more visibility as well. In previous thread on /r/privacy people on Twitter have discovered that Anonabox guy has a lot of little helpers both on twitter and on official Kickstarter comments. Everyone please check out the comments there, I won't name any names but it's kinda obvious who has the most replies there https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/augustgermar/anonabox-a-tor-hardware-router/comments

Update on Anonabox friend... he just got BANNED from kickstarter. We're talking about a guy who spent DAYS attacking people who wanted to share their doubts. GOOD! Is this the end of Anonabox?


**EDIT: Wired just posted a new article about all that it's happening with Anonabox in past few days**

http://www.wired.com/2014/10/anonabox-backlash/

I really want to give credit to Wired author for taking time to investigate the accusations! 

It seems that August from Anonabox is still refusing to show even a fraction of remorse for his actions that included intentional false representation, having bunch of people attack and attempt to discredit anyone who says anything against the anonabox, people who are clearly friends of his. He actually fabricated another lie in a effort to additionally deceive all of us by saying:

&gt; He insists his Kickstarter was actually aimed at developers and beta testers who he hoped would try out the Anonabox and work together to help him iron out its issues. “I had thought this would be like push-starting a car,” Germar says. “Instead, it’s been like being handcuffed to a rocket.” 

This is colossal bullshit, exactly the same one from the beginning, where he claimed the device is 100% open source and 100% his creation after years of prototyping (and 3 gens of NOT off the shelf hardware). If it was aimed for developers, why was the story about Arab Spring mentioned (made up)? Why is their kickstarter page saying they want to build ant-censorship box (?!) and ship it to the people? The people that are journalists, protesters and other non-tech people... clearly NOT BETA TESTERS AND DEVELOPERS.  

Feel free to analyze in detail the new Wired article, I find it even more offending and proving that he just want's the money, he will sell you everything you want to hear, as long as he gets his money.",technology,1413440592

MachineLearning,Why is my gradient descent algorithm stopping so soon?,"I am trying to implement a logistic regression classification in MATLAB and am stuck with calculating the correct weights using gradient descent.

I am using a stochastic approach, so i update each weight in the vector of weights individually    for each feature and then move onto the next sample and do again.

I am using the update equation

theta_j := theta_j - alpha * (y_i - h_theta(x_i)) * x_ij

and i break when the difference between the last weight vector and the current one is less than 0.00005. I calculate the ""difference"" between the two vectors by subtracting one from the other and then taking the square root of the dot product of their difference vector. 

The problem is that it seems to stop updating after only four updates, so only the first four of my 8 row weight vector is even updated at all. This happens no matter what my learning rate, alpha, is.

Here is my implementation:

    end


I have also tried doing a global method instead of stochastic, but it still results in extremely large weight values.

Here is my evaluateSigmoid function

    function logisticPrediciton = evaluateSigmoid(weightVector, sample)
        %% This function evaluates the sigmoid with a given weight vector and sample
        %% Input:
        % weightVector - column  vector of n weights
        % sample - row vector sample with n-1 features (a 1 will be appended to the
        % beginning for the constant weight
        
        sample = transpose(sample); % sample is fed in as a row vector, so must be transposed
        
        exponent = exp( -1 .* transpose(weightVector) * sample);
        
        logisticPrediciton = 1 ./ ( 1 + exponent);
        
        
    end

[And here is the data set i am working with.][1] The last column is filtered out, and the first column is turned into 1 or zero based on if it meets a threshold (below 22 is 0, above is 1).


**EDIT**: I know why it is stopping but don't know how to fix it. When the estimator uses the guess weights and happens to classify it as 1 or 0 correctly (matched with the true class), the error is zero which means newWeightVector equals oldWeightVector and the difference becomes zero. How do i avoid this? Its obvious that my guess the correct weight distribution.

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 281 - We Don't Know Yet,"Hey all, GoodShibe here.

So, yesterday I wrote what I thought was a pretty fair and balanced farewell to a very divisive company within our community.  

Almost immediately afterward, Alex came forward with a flourish [to announce that Moolah was not, in fact, going anywhere](http://blog.moolah.io/2014/10/15/the-reports-of-my-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated/).

14-ish hours later, Jackson Palmer released some 'evidence' which has since, at face value, shed a whole new light upon why Moolah has seemed unable to put out a steady stream of promised products.

Last night, [a former employee stepped forward, offering to reveal back-channel communications](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2jdid4/a_few_words_from_a_former_moolah_employee/).

As of 4 hours ago, [Alex has publicly resigned from Moolah](http://blog.moolah.io/2014/10/16/a-public-resignation/).

Right now, there are threads going up apologizing to Jackson and Ben - who did try to warn us - and, looking at what's been presented, it appears that there's been some real research put into figuring out who he is and what he may have done.

But here's the problem: the key words are 'May have'.  None of what I've seen so far is a smoking gun indicative of actual, current, wrongdoing.  A whole lot of 'this guy has a history of misdeeds' and definitely things that qualify as 'flat out bad management' and 'irresponsible' in regards to their company but... that's it.

*Now, I am in no way saying he's not all of the things that people say he is.*

But here's the thing:

Alex Green has asked the question

""What laws have been broken?""

And the answer is:

**We don't know yet.**

We're not the Internet police.

However, what IS warranted is taking whatever we have and giving it over to the proper, trained, UK and US authorities.  Essentially, if you're a citizen of an non-UK country and you believe you've been wronged, bring this case to the attention of the proper authorities in your country.  The more eyes on this the better.

Because there is enough 'evidence' now to get the law looking into this.  

Because here's the problem: What, really, are you going to do with this information that you've gleaned?  File a lawsuit?  Are you going to show up at his house?  So far, what's been 'proven' is that Alex may, in fact, be a long-time scammer -- and Alex admits that

""In the eyes of the law, my name is Alex Green.""

So, either he isn't whom people thinks he is, or he really, honestly believes that a legal name change will protect him from any possible prior misdeeds (it won't).

Interestingly enough, I've since had a few people send me snarky PMs about how they 'tried to warn me' and that 'I did nothing'.  But the thing is that having a few people send me hush-hush PMs with 'concerns' and every other abstract emotion is not actionable 'evidence'.

Do you want to know how scammers prosper?  They beat their accusers.

They weather the storm.  

That's how they get people like Ben -- who has since had /u/neutralitymentality banned from Reddit, by Reddit admins, for repeatedly breaking Reddit's 'no personal information' rule -- and even Jackson run off of the site.

They wait for well-meaning people to bring weak-sauce evidence against them and they, repeatedly weather it.  Because it's not a smoking gun.  The best scammers know how to hide their tracks - delete compromising threads, get compromising threads deleted because they break site rules, deal in back channels, etc.

There's grey area.  It's circumstantial.

And that's where Scammers thrive.

Do you want to know the most damning thing that's been done so far?  

It was 5 months ago, when Moolah tried to up and leave the community over a post by a one-day old account, claiming that this 'attack' was the final straw.  Moolah had claimed that that 'experienced members' were bullying him.

[You can read that thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/24cz49/) (The original writing that caused the firestorm was deleted and replaced with what's there now, which is admitted to in the post -- however it was enough to get people very, very riled up).

But check out the top comment.  

[And you can see my response here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/24cz49/goodbye_rdogecoin_neither_i_nor_my_company_will/ch5xu19).

I called Moolah out for trying to up and leave our community on a lark and I got attacked for 'abusing my position to make matters worse'.

Evidence is key.

**Reddit is not a court of Law.**  We are not trained investigators, lawyers, judges.

Do you know how scammers, especially big time scammers -- not saying that this directly applies to Moolah, yet -- slip away?  People try to fix things themselves.  They try 'internet justice'.  And where has that gotten anyone?

I say, we do the work.  Try to answer the question:

""What laws have been broken?"".

**To that end, screenshots, emails, everything need to be saved by as many people as possible so that things like times and dates and such can be corroborated**.  

And then we, as a community, turn it over to the proper authorities and let them do their job:

Investigate.

If no laws have been broken, then we consider it a lesson learned and we move forward.

If laws have been broken, then we send a powerful message that our community stands together and looks out for its own.

But, either way, we are not equipped to handle this.
 
So, please, bring this - and everything you have - to the people who are.

It's 8:12AM EST and we've found 94.27% of our first 100 Billion DOGEs - Only 5.73% remains until we reach our soft cap.  Our global hashrate is down from ~1373 to ~1028 and our Difficulty is down from ~18070 to ~16936.

We are getting near a position where we would like to finally buy a house. We will have no debt by the time we buy this house. Two reliable cars, a 2008 Accord with 50k miles and a 2014 Civic with about 2k miles.

I'm in the military so we can expect a steady paycheck.

Have about two months worth in the emergency fund. 

We are looking at buying a 290k house. It will be brand new and built in a growing development.

The we've shopped around and most of the loans are at a 3-3.5% interest rate on a 30 year loan and tax rate will be 2.5 (I know it's ridiculous but you can't escape it here). About 900 in homeowners insurance, and on a 0% down VA loan.

I estimate we should be able to pay off the house in 12 years. I am contributing a small amount to my Roth TSP but not maxing it out.

Would it be smart to pay off the house according to my plan and then bank everything in retirement accounts after this?

We need a house and honestly are sick of moving. I hate the idea of debt and my wife is onboard. I will likely be here for the rest of my career and we want a forever home. We also have no children and do not plan on having any within the foreseeable future.",finance,1413467209

personalfinance,How should I prioritize a 2nd emergency fund for a rental property be and how large should it be?,"Hey guys, I did some brief searching but I didn't see a topic that addresses my question specifically.  I've seen comments here and there on the subject, but I'd like to know if there's a prevailing view on how to plan for rental property emergencies.

**TL;DR** My wife and I are able to handle rent for ourselves and a mortgage for my old house, currently occupied by my mother that can't afford to pay rent.  We contribute to 401K/Roth/E-fund fund for ourselves, but our short term goal of paying off our car &amp; student loans in the next 3-4 years requires putting all extra take home money towards loans. 

1. It feels prudent to try to build a 2nd emergency fund just for the rental property, but how do I figure out what amount to aim for? 

2. How should we prioritize a 2nd emergency fund among paying off loans, maxing out retirement funds, and investing if FI/early retirement is our goal? 

2. From a budgeting perspective, should we count the mortgage as part of our own living expenses or an investment? 

 My wife and I disagree on this aspect. She sees it as a fixed payment for a house that we're required to pay for and the fact that we don't live in it doesn't factor in.  I see it as an asset we invest in (because we're building equity in at a rate equal to the interest rate on the mortgage) and that because we don't live in it, it's not a housing cost for us. Maybe it's not right to say it's an investment, but I have trouble saying it's part of our housing costs too.

**Details:**
About 4 years ago, I bought a single family home (15y note @ 3.75%, ~7-8 years left). My mom lived with me at the time because my parents are estranged and she works a low wage job. After I got married and moved to another state for work, she stayed in the house, making me an accidental landlord. 

She pays most of her recurring expenses (health/car/renters insurance, gas, utilities) - she just can't afford to pay market rent or close to it because her health insurance is so high. It's basically a net loss/$0 income property because my priority right now is to have her build an emergency fund (so that I don't have to fill that role as well).

Our current rent is about $1270/mo, much higher than my mortgage of $761/mo (includes T+I) + $40/mo extra + 1 extra pmt/yr (biweekly payments). I also pay for lawn care, internet, and a termite bond for the house to the tune of ~$130/mo. When I was still living in the house, it was the normal cycle of things breaking constantly and I'd pay for them out of the one emergency fund I had at the time.

My wife and I have been trimming our lifestyle &amp; spending with the goal of FI/early retirement, but having an add'l mortgage is obviously a huge drain on our objectives. We're able to handle paying both and our current ~3 month emergency fund includes having to pay the mortgage+maintenance on the house.  However, incidental costs like having to replace the HVAC unit or hot water heater (both are near the end of their lifetimes) is difficult to plan for. Therefore, I'm curious what approach other landlords here take to plan for these situations.",finance,1413474492

personalfinance,Inheritance and Savings. Pay off my mortgage or not.,"I just inherited mutual funds worth about $11,000 from my grandmother. I have been planning to just let them sit, because they've been generating an average of 9%+ since before I was born. My wife and I also have some bonds and savings amounting to about $13,000. So that's roughly $24,000, together. We are 27 and 28. Our after-tax income is somewhere around $50k. We also have a mortgage at $30,092, interest rate 3.625%. No other debt.

I want to know how wise it would be to just knock out the mortgage in a year or two, at the expense of all other kinds of saving. If we eliminated it today, we'd own the house free and clear, and we'd save $9200 in interest. We could immediately begin putting aside $1000+ a month toward our IRAs and other savings goals. We could also consider buying a second property to use as a rental, work on business ventures with more of a safety net, lots of other options. 

Do you think it is worth it to aggressively kill the mortgage, at the expense of other, more conservative investment and savings? Or should I just pay the monthly minimum at this awesome interest rate, saving more evenly all around. I will say, we're both comfortable with a fair amount of risk.",finance,1413478210

personalfinance,Advice on current financial health and possibility of tapping home equity to pay off student debt,"Hello, r/personalfinance!  Long time lurker, first time poster.... So here is our current situation that I was hoping someone could offer advice on what to do next:  

The combined income for my wife and I is $120,000/yr. We have great credit, health insurance, and we are contributing $1,200/mo (total, between the two of us) towards our retirement accounts.  We have, between the two of us, about $44,000 in retirement accounts, and we have about $35k in the bank in liquid cash as our savings. The only life insurance we have is thru each of our jobs, and its only in an amount equal to 1 year salary.  

Our house is worth $356,000, but we still owe $244,000 on it. Thus, we have $112,000 in equity in our home.  Our interest rate is 3.5%, so our payment is about $1,200/mo for the mortgage.  Once house insurance and property taxes are thrown in, it comes out to around $1,800/mo. 

I have tons and tons of debt from grad school, but I'm making payments through the Income Based Repayment option;  I work in the public sector, so I am eligible for total loan forgiveness in about 8 years.  I massage the numbers so that my taxable income is as low as possible, so my student payment is only about $115/mo (pennies, I know!).  

My wife has $55,000 in debt from school loans, and is paying $1425/mo on them. (The standard payment is $1200, but she pays an extra $200 towards principal each month) She is on a 10 year repayment plan, and the interest rate is 7.65%. I think she has about 6 years to go at this rate.

We file our taxes separately so that her income is not included in mine when calculating my loan repayment amount.  She takes the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction on her tax return b/c she benefits from it more that I would.  

We just bought a car for 0 down and 0% interest over 5 years.  The payment is around $425.  We also have our first child on the way, expected in January 2015.

My question is, would it be wise to get a home equity loan in order to pay off my wife's remaining student debt?  I understand that it in theory puts the house at risk, but I don't foresee either of us losing or jobs.  I'm thinking that the ability to deduct the interest of the student loans on her taxes, combined w/ the (slightly) lower rate we would get w/ the home equity line makes this proposition a no brainer.  As it is now, she cannot deduct one penny of interest from her loans b/c we file separately.

We were told we could pay 5% down, and qualify for a Conventional loan that has a lender paid mortgage insurance.   Our other option is to do an FHA loan by paying 3% down, and having private mortgage insurance. 

My understanding is that the interest rate is higher for the conventional loan, but the mortgage insurance costs less.

We have an FHA loan on another property, and once we established enough equity, the private mortgage insurance was dropped.  Does this happen with a lender paid mortgage insurance too?

If not, would the conventional loan end up costing us more money longterm?

personalfinance,"Cosign fiancee's mortgage? 29 y/o, $180k salary","First off, I know that in general cosigning isn't a favorable situation, but I think it may be worthwhile here.  Could use some other opinions, though.

My fiancee and I aren't getting married until late next year, but she just landed a great new job in a nearby city (~3 hours away) that starts in November.  This job is critical to her career progression, so there's no question in her taking it.  However, I can't go with her for at least 10 months.

In the meantime, I'd like to buy a relatively cheap house in the city where she will work.  I'm thinking something in the range of $170-$180k.  That way it's no sweat off my back even if the real estate market goes into the crapper again *and* I don't waste money on leasing a tiny apartment.  However, the problem is securing a home mortgage in the new city when I don't live there.

Since she will be living there, my working theory is that I should be able to cosign a mortgage for her despite being in another city.  This is preferable since, although I could simply give her the cash for a downpayment, my understanding is that this would be treated as a gift and she would need to pay taxes on it.  Also, my credit rating is ~780, while hers is merely OK.  Finally, the real estate market there seems very healthy, at least from the outside, and I worry that prices and interest rates will be significantly higher the longer I wait.

So is this possible?  Or is it a bad idea for other reasons?

personalfinance,Debt Snowball vs Debt Avalanche - Which is Better?,"First off let me start by saying that I've never actually been in debt (aside from mortgages on rental properties) so obviously I can't speak from experience on this.

So I wanted to ask for some feedback from those who have actually dug themselves out of debt on which strategy they used - debt avalanche or debt snowball (or something else?). If you're not familiar with the terms, with snowball you pay off your debts starting with the one that has the lowest balance and working your way up. With avalanche, you start with the one that has the highest interest rate and work your way down.

[Here is a handy calculator](http://unbury.me/) I found that will tell you how long it will take you to pay off your debt and how much interest you'll pay using either of the two. To me, debt avalanche seems better, because it will always result in you becoming debt free the fastest and will minimize the interest you pay. But I know some people like the snowball because you can get a boost of confidence from paying off a few low-balance debts fairly quickly.

I've done [this short case study](http://financessful.com/debt-snowball-vs-debt-avalanche/) that illustrates how debt avalanche is faster is cheaper. But what's your experience been like?",finance,1413490724

personalfinance,(CA) Collections company failed to report that I made a full payment. After four years.,"Hi,
So, long story short. Got a cell phone, didn't make payments. Account is cancelled and cellphone worth is calculated with payments I haven't made. Total sum is made and sent to me. I was unemployed and unable to pay. It is sent to a collection agency.

I pay the collection agency in FULL in 2010... I figured it was over. Come today (oct 16 2014). I go to apply for a credit card (first time). I call them to see if it is approved. I am told that it is declined due to a failure to pay my cell phone payment from 2010! I call my cell phone company and see what is going on. It turns out the collection Agency has FAILED to report my payment from 2010.

So, for the last 4+ years my credit score has been going down. Because of the collection agency FAILING to report my payment. My cellphone company quickly confirms it is paid and closes the account and tells me to call the agency asap. Now, I'm attempting to call the collections agency and they are busy.
What can I do? They have screwed me. I have bought a car at a high interest rate because of this. I did not know I figured it was because it's my first car at 23. But now I know it's because of this failure to report my payment to my cellphone company. Can I get some sort of reimbursement from them? What should I do??",finance,1413500361
personalfinance,"Expecting a $3,000 bonus this year, which student loan to throw it at for the most satisfaction?","First, I always throw all of my bonus at student loan debt.  Second, I can't decide which loan to put it toward:

Option 2.  $110,000, 4.41 interest rate, private loan, 1300 payment monthly

I have a total of 6 student loans, but these represent my lowest loan amount and highest interest rate.  I'm well aware of the ""throw it at your highest interest rate"" rhetoric, but these are pretty close together.  I already have a 6 month emergency fund in place and no other debts but student loans.  The $3,000 won't kill the $5,400, and at such a low interest rate, should I bother?  However it might be nice to just try to kill the lowest loan as fast as possible.  I'm not really saving THAT much money paying the $3,000 toward the highest interest rate.  What would you do?

personalfinance,(CA) Collections Agency fails to report I have made a full payment. Four years later I find out. Now credit score is horrible..,"Hi

Long story short. I got a cell phone in 2011. I missed 2 payments and my account was cancelled. I was billed for the cost of the phone for the remaining months as well as the 2 payments. I was unable to pay due to being unemployed at the time. So, my cell phone company sends it in to a collection agency.

The collection agency relentlessly calls until I finally was able to pay them in full two months after it was sent to them. After I paid I figured it was all done and over with. 

Four years later (2014). I caved in on getting a credit card for online purchases. I call my bank and make an application and send it in. I call them a few days after to see if I am approved. I was denied. The reason? I owed a collection agency through my cell phone company. Confused I called my cell phone company and ask why this is happening.

After an hour of back and fourth conversation. We found out that the collection agency had FAILED to report that I had made my payment. So, for the last FOUR years I have been getting BAD credit ratings. Thus my credit score is very very low. They quickly called the collection agency and got it figured out on their end.

Now, I'm stuck attempting to call this collection agency to get my credit score fixed. 

What can I do about this? I paid for a car on a loan with a high interest because of this. Otherwise I'd have decent credit and a lower interest rate. Is there any reimbursement I can ask for? Is there anyway I can get something back out of there mistake? I feel like they have screwed up and I deserve something for their mistake as it has affected me financially.",finance,1413501145

personalfinance,I was denied by multiple bank accounts.,"My short back-story: I recently turned 18 and I applied for an Ally online savings account (.90%) in order to store my money for long term in another place besides my checking(.01% lol). Almost 2 weeks went by and I never received any confirmation, even after multiple calls to them. On my latest call I spoke to the rep who told me that my app was not looked at since I submitted it and he thinks it may have been denied by their department that reviews the applications. I thought this was strange and I confronted my mom about it and she suggested that I just apply for a different savings account with another organization. 

So I applied for GE Capital Bank(.95%) and immediately after I submitted my app I got a email that basically said ""you were denied because information may have been transposed on the application."" I thought this was especially strange since my mother and I reviewed the app to ensure that there were no mistakes at all. My mom said that I should try annualcreditreport.com to check my report for free and so I did that. After submitting those forms, they also failed from all 3 of the companies that provide a report. ""unable to process request"" or something along those lines. At this point I think there is just something wrong with my social security number, maybe it doesn't match my name? But that doesn't make sense since I had 2 jobs before and I have successfully filed federal and state tax reports using that SSN. At this point my mom and I are just dumbfounded. I also applied for a MySocialSecurity account on ssa.gov and that also failed. 

I have no idea what is going on, all I want to do is move my money from my checking to a savings with high interest asap since I feel uncomfortable carrying around a card with so much money on it. Please, any advice would be helpful.

Adler is staying put — and she’s not alone. The dearth of residential listings nationwide is now feeding on itself, with homeowners such as Adler reluctant to sell because of the difficulty in finding a place to buy. For others who refinanced into historically low interest rates, the prospect of rising borrowing costs makes selling less appealing.

personalfinance,"Graduated College with over $100,000 in debt. As of today I am debt free!","In 2008 I graduated college and along with my diploma and starting real life, I accumulated a ton of debt:

Student Loan 1 (public): $7400 @ 6% interest  
Student Loan 2 (public): $6000 @ 2% interest  
Student Loan 3 (private): $58,000 @ 3% interest  
Car Loan: $13,000 @ .9% interest  
USAA Personal Loan: $25,000 @ 2% interest  
Best Buy Credit Card: $2000 @ 0% (deferred)  

At first I didn't understand the scope of my problem - I owed a lot of money.  In college, I had a job and paid for my own apartment, but I made so little money that I simply didn't understand how much $10,000 actually was.  Once it dawned on me that I owed a ton of money, I knew I had to act on it and started my plan.  

I tackled the debt based on a modified snowball approach.  Instead of paying off the loans with the smallest debt first, I paid off the loans based on a worst case scenario approach. The rationale was ""what would happen if I lost my job tomorrow.""  So, I made it a goal to pay off my car first.  Sure, it had one of the lowest interest rates but here is my thought process: if I defaulted on my debt, they at least couldn't take my car (I know that it is possible for assets to be seized but that takes time).  I saved my student loan debt for last for 2 reasons.  1 - the interest was tax deductible.  2 - if I defaulted, they couldn't take away my degree.

Throughout most of 2009, I paid only the minimum payments on all my debts.  Towards the end of that year, I started doubling my car payments.  By 2010 I was tripling/quintupling them.  I paid the car off in July of 2010.  This is what got the snowball rolling because now I had $359 extra a month.  I then focused on the Best Buy credit card.  Yes, it was at 0%, but I just wasn't comfortable with the looming 23% interest that I would get if I didn't pay it off in time.  I paid off that card by September of 2010.  

Following the credit card, I focused on my highest interest loan.  This was the public student loan @ 6%.  That was paid off in January of 2011.  Another big break happened to me in 2011, I decided to get my Master's degree.  So, even though I still accumulated interest on my private student loan, I no longer had to pay the minimums.  Using this break, I paid off the $25,000 personal loan.  This was paid off in August 2011.  After that I paid off the smaller student loan, it was at 0% interest at this time, but I wanted to get it out of the way.  That was paid off in November 2011.  

That left one final loan.  The big one.  from December 2011 to October 2014, I focused on paying off this enormous loan.  I was more than quintupling the minimum payment.  I started paying the minimums in 2013 because I moved to the East Coast. Having lived in the midwest and mountain west I was unaccustomed to the high cost of living.  But, this past month I moved back the the mountain west and my living expenses dropped significantly while my salary remained the same.  This allowed me to sprint towards the finish line and finish paying off the student loan account.  

Total debt payment (including interest): **$115,379.56**

Other than the Best Buy credit card, I had no credit card debt.  I paid off my balance in full every month (and have earned several hundred dollars in rewards as a result).  During this time period, I also managed to save up $60,000 in assets (stocks/mutual funds/IRA).  I also have an emergency fund that is sitting at $10,000.  

I realize that I was extremely fortunate in that I have had well paying jobs in mostly low cost of living areas.  I didn't really live frugally and I only had roommates for a handful of months.  But I didn't make crazy purchases either or spend all my money eating out/going to the bars.  

*Going Forward:*

Even though my student loans says account paid in full, it really won't dawn on me that I don't have to pay any more monthly payments until next month.  I'm still pondering what to do with my extra cash now.  I've already decided I am increasing my 401k contribution.  I'm also going to buy some toys that I have wanted for a long time (15TB+ NAS file server and a road bike).  I want to increase my IRA/mutual fund contributions but I need to research that heavily before I do.

personalfinance,Consolidating credit cards,"Hi. I've got a couple questions about credit card consolidation. I've got to credit cards with a total combined line of credit that equals $3500. I'm currently holding about $3200 across those. My CapitalOne card has about $850 on it at 12.15% interest and the Bank of America card has about $2200 at 14.24%. I've been thinking of different ways to tackle this debt and I've come up with three ideas. I wanted to see what advice y'all would have for me.

Idea one: Don't change a thing and keep paying the separate bills.

Idea two: Get a third credit card with a higher limit (around $5000) and transfer the balances from the other two cards. The card I am thinking about is the [Bank of America Better Balance Rewards card](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/products/better-balance-rewards.go). It gives you an extra $25 every quarter for making more than minimum  payments each month which I always do.

Idea three: Get a personal loan from [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for $4000. They have interest rates starting at 6.8% which is drastically lower than what I can qualify for on a credit card. 

At the moment my income is between $1200 and $1500 (I'm a temp right now) a month. I also have roughly $30,000 in student loan debt which is deferred due to unemployment.

To give some background, I graduated from college in 2008. I immediately moved from MA to NYC where I worked and earned a graduate degree (at my own expense). I am now living back in MA after 6 years of fun and carefree financial decisions.


I've been back in MA for about 6 months. I've become mature enough only within the last year to begin confronting my debt and bad financial habits. I've actually made a huge amount of progress in 2014, paying off about $6k of cc debt and saving $5,600 ($3k was contributed to a side business that I've started in September which is nearly profitable. I'll begin taking home $200- $500/month in compensation starting in December). All while leasing a new car and incurring hefty moving expenses.


My credit card debt will be wiped out in November. I'd like to build up an emergency fund of $15,600 which will cover 6 months of living expenses including student loans (but minus any entertainment/iced coffees etc). The amount of time this takes will vary with my income.


I'm projecting an income of $81,000 in 2015.


Given my current financial situation, these are my priorities.

1. Credit Card Debt

2. Emergency Fund Goal of $15,600

3. Save for house

4. Roth IRA - open and begin contributions


Does this plan make sense? On months when I'm netting an additional $850 beyond my basic expenses, should I put that entirely towards my emergency fund goal?


Once that goal is met, should I split it up between saving for a house downpayment, student loans, and an IRA? Or should I scrap the IRA and put more towards my student loans?

Bitcoin,Hey Jordan! Just some advice from a tech guy with greying hair and a penchant for hot chocolate and comfy slippers. Take it all with a pinch of salt…,"Earlier this year I was sat with a good friend in a London Taxi after a night out on the town.  He'd just read an email on his phone, ""That fucking Jordan, I swear I'm gonna' punch him in the face if I ever meet him.""  
""ATM delayed again then?"" I replied.  
Some 3 months late on the original delivery time and my friend was beyond furious.  It was all we could do but laugh at this point, and it's perhaps due to my mates sharp self-deprecating English humour and British 'stiff-upper lippedness' that he got through it all without actually punching anyone or anything (we Brits anticipate everything being as shit as the weather here, so bad news bounces off us like hailstones on shingle most of the time).  

His ATM's arrived in the end after a lot of hassle and the embarrassment of delayed launches and, AFAIK, he and his partner have had no major technical issues (though all the KYC stuff has been disabled as it's not yet needed in the UK).  Regardless, it takes a lot for my friend (whose a big teddy bear at heart) to get to the point where he wants to actually punch someone in the face…

Whilst concessions can be made for new and young companies who, in their excitement and enthusiasm tend to over-promise and under-deliver, the recent 'Robogate' controversy reveals a greater problem at the heart of Robocoin and it is that of a young CEO who has drunk the Ayn Rand / Gecko Kool Aid and got swept away by all the suits and Vegas business luncheons.  It's all too easy to let all that back-patting and lip-service go to your head.

Whilst Jordan's apology and swift refund is of course welcomed by the community, the numerous responses he has made (and retracted) prior to 'doing the right thing' tells me he is simply in damage-limitation mode and will ultimately view this whole thing as nothing more than an unfortunate PR mistake.  For what it's worth I pass on the following piece of advice to Jordan and hope he learns the more important lesson at the crux of all of this.

I started out in my mid-twenties as a web developer with my best mate from Uni; my third big job was for a young entrepreneur like Jordan (let's call him Gordon).  He was in his early twenties, had been born into money (public school, father a successful doctor/author) whereas I was from a working class background who gravitated to middle-class in my teens after a lot of hard graft on the part of my Mother and Step-father.  Gordon was making 60k a month when I met him for the contract interview (he owned a finance portal that earned revenue through PPC (Espotting/Overture) clicks).

I was pretty much blown away - I had no idea PPC could make so much money.  Gordon went onto to suggest I build a shopping site, he'd supply a feed and I'd get 20% of revenues.  ""It might make nothing, it might make 5k a month.  That's the risk you take""  We shook hands and made a Gentlemen's agreement and to my astonishment, within 3 months the site was making 40k a month.  I called him up after no payments were made ""Ahh, well when I agreed on 20% I had no idea it was going to make 40k a month mate.  I'm only happy to give you 5%"".  Aghast, I say no deal, he laughs and tells me I shouldn't have been so stupid as to not ask for a signed contract.  ""That's business mate.  You have to be ruthless.  Take the 5% or I'll see you in court.  Expect to lose.""

I quickly scrambled to the PC and in a few minutes we had encrypted everything on the web server so that none of the html could be edited, we then added a self-destruct script that would be activated when a certain phrase was entered into the search box on the front end of the site (effectively wiping everything on the server with a shell command).  Gordon changed the root password as we expected, hired a new web dev guy and kept raking in the money… 

Meanwhile, we moved onto the next job (needless to say we reneged on the original contracted work) and waited for the phone to ring…

A few months later the phone did indeed ring ""Er mate, my new web guy is having some problems updating the web pages.""
""Yeah, that's 'cause everything is encrypted.  You can't change anything without starting from scratch.""
""Oh, well no matter, it's still making 30k a month so I guess I still win.""
""Actually there is another thing we did; if you type 'German Cabbage Patch Doll Sticker Collection' into the search bar the entire site will be wiped and along with it, all that beautiful money…""
""What the...""
""Course no-one is going to do that if you just give me what we agreed to - 20% of earnings to date - I don't even care about future earnings, since we want nothing more to do with you.""
""I'll wire it right now.""

He later offered me 50% of his company for 50% of mine, I turned him down on account of his character.  He went onto sue a former partner who refused to hand back a company car after being stiffed in a similar contractual manner (the former partner won with nothing more than a pro-bono lawyer).  Years later, he stole a business idea from our company and effectively halved our income overnight.  When an employee left his company and did exactly the same thing to him (with the exact same idea) he considered suing them.  

He has been on the Sunday Times rich list for top entrepreneurs under 30 and the relentless pursuit of money and power was all his life was about until a family tragedy, the likes of which I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy occurred some years ago.  I went to the funeral, the first time I met him in over a decade and saw a broken man.  Shortly after, he split with his wife.

He's since authored a book on the subject and has 100's of employees that benefit from free private healthcare (rare in a British company) as well as company paid-for group vacations every year.   

He's a good, honest, open guy now, but he learnt the *very* hard way that life and business isn't simply about competing; it's pointless getting to the top of the ladder if you have no true friends to experience the highs and lows along the way.  It's pointless having a bulging bank account if you don't have the mutual respect and love of those people around you.  And it's pointless having happy customers if you got them by screwing everyone along the way.

I hope that recent events embolden Jordan to 'do the right thing' in future, not simply because it makes 'good business sense', but because it makes 'good human sense'.

personalfinance,$3000 school loan with $950 finance charge. Ripoff?,"Hey everyone,

So I am a med student and have been taking out loans for school. Apparently I didn't fill out some forms on a small loan the school advertised as a good one to take (instead of unsubsidized federal loans). I went to go fill out the forms so the loan could be distributed and saw that for the $3000 dollar loan, there is a finance charge of $950. This seems like a huge ripoff to me, to have to pay almost a thousand dollars just to get three thousand in loans. Is this normal for a loan like this, or is it a huge ripoff?

personalfinance,Sell stock to re-finance mortgage?,"I bought my $200,000 house about 5 years ago using an FHA loan and about 5000 down.  (First of many stupid mistakes)  I got a 6% interest rate and with taxes, I pay around 1850 a month.  Two years ago our roof started leaking so I got a Title 1 loan for around $15,000 to fix the roof (it needed venting and gutters).  

I failed to realize when I got the loan that it would prevent me from re-financing the house to lower my interest rate.  My wife started working part time to spend more time with our son and we are looking for ways to cut expenses.  

When I was born 35 years ago, my uncle gave me $1000 worth of private stock that is now worth around $50,000.  At times I think the only smart thing I've ever done financially is not cash in this stock.  

Lately I started looking at my numbers and I realized I could sell my stock, pay off the Title 1 loan, refinance my mortgage to get a cheaper rate and remove my PMI and I would save more money then my stock is earning every year.  Since I've owned the house, my house value hasn't increased but it hasn't decreased either.  My estimate is around $7k in gains taxes on the stock (based on the long term gain rate).   Over 35 years my stock has increased at a rate of around $2800/year.  If I remove my loan payment ($250/month), the PMI ($100), and reduce my interest rate ($1-200) I could save $5400/year.

personalfinance,What do you do when the cards are stacked against you?,"I've always been good with budgeting, saving money, and maintaining a really high credit score.  But lately I've been having some medical issues, and now the cards are stacked against me.

I have asthma, and it's always been well controlled.  A few weeks ago, I caught a cold from a co-worker which then developed into a severe upper and lower respiratory infection.  As a child, pneumonia almost killed me five times, so that's always a big worry of mine.  My asthma got way out of control with this last infection, and I even stopped breathing several times during nocturnal asthma attacks.

I am on a new inhaler that helps me tremendously, but I have to pay $200/week for it.  I do have insurance, but it's a $3,000 deductible.  I will probably hit it by December, and then it will start over again in January.

As far as my income goes, my take home pay is around $1300/month.  I am a full time teller supervisor at a bank.  I am also a full time college student double majoring in accounting and finance.  

I do have an emergency savings account which will cover my costs, but that money will be drained rapidly year after year.  I thought about going down to a part time job and then getting qualified for Medicaid while still going to school.  My boyfriend is a college student who qualified for Medicaid and all of his medical costs are free.  

Each option will hit my finances hard.  I think perhaps a part-time job is what I'll ulimately have to do.  Currently, my job is very stressful.  My company underwent a large software conversion, and it went wrong.  I am responsible for overlooking the staff, solving all customer problems, and balancing the bank.  I'm also in charge of the vault and dealing with the Federal Reserve.  If there's an issue with any of my responsibilities, I have to solve it.  In addition to all of this, our branch is short-staffed and very busy.  I usually have a line of customers to help in addition to my supervisor responsibilities.

Stress is probably a major factor to my health.  Mentally I can handle it, but physically I cannot.  I have used up all of my sick time, and my savings are slowly depleating.  I was not this sick prior to the changes in my job, although I am apt to catch anything that is going around--it just doesn't get out of hand.

Any suggestions for what I should do?  

I should note I do live with my boyfriend (very serious relationship), and his take home pay is around $1060/month.  I'm sure I can figure out a budget with me going part-time, but I am very afraid of not having enough money at the end of each month.  Of course, with my medication, it's looking like we're heading in that direction no matter what.  

I have looked into the ACA health insurance marketplace, and none of the plans are any better than what I currently have.  Plus, I'm not allowed to purchase them since my employer exceeds minimum standards.

tl;dr Costs of medical bills and medication are eating away at my emergency savings.  I'm in college trying to better myself while working a full time job, but I will soon be going into the hole every month just so I can stay alive.  Should I do a part-time job, get on Medicaid to cover my medicine, and attend college full-time (I have lots of scholarships)?",finance,1413571791

Hey all! Just found out about this subreddit and I'll try to make it short.

I'm 22yrs old, in Canada and I work as a Junior IT Consultant at a relatively new firm. The pay is quite well in regards to other newbies in the field so I'm satisfied.

I do pay rent at my parents house and contribute a monthly donation to my community. With some personal bills and fees, I basically use 1 full paycheck to take care of those. The second paycheck is usually for paying off my credit card expenses and a little bit of savings.

My car though is about to break down and I will need to either finance or lease a vehicle Q1 of 2015, so around Feb-March (Lowest interest rates!)

**My question is basically:** I can afford $600 for a car payment. Do I go with a fully loaded ""Regular"" car which would work out to be $450 a month then save the rest OR allow myself to enjoy a ""Luxury"" sportier car now OR actually get an older vehicle for much cheaper and contribute even more to my RRSP (Retirement Fund)

This is excluding Gas and Insurance as I already take care of that either way. A Luxury car would take premium gas, but it's a difference of $60 monthly to what my van already takes, technically negligible in the whole process.",finance,1413573009

personalfinance,Should I refinance my mortgage?,"We got a refinance offer from Quickenloans and it got me thinking. Would refinancing be a good idea? The main reason I can think of would be to lower the interest rate, and lower the monthly payment (we are paying my student loans off first, so that extra would go there until they were paid off, then we'd focus on home loan.)

Basically our stats are this:

* Home loan: $123,700 principal, 4.25% interest, $1135 monthly. we are not struggling to meet this, but the example offer we got was $500 lower, which could go to 6.3% student loans instead

* Original maturity date of mortgage is 9/1/2041, I understand this would extend that, but we aren't planning to allow the loan to go to its est. maturity date regardless

* About $117,000 combined income with wife

* Other debt is $24,400 student loan @ 6.3%, as well as a $31,000 car loan at 3.84% interest

Our credit ratings are both in the 770+ range, and DTI is good. 

The example refinance offer we got was a variable rate, versus fixed rate which our current one is. It had some confusing language though; it said it would start out at 3.75%(ish) for the first 5 years, then drop to 2.75% for the rest of the loan, but could change the % each year. How bad of an idea would that be? Should I stick to fixed rate only, or is this something I should consider? Or should I stick with current loan?",finance,1413575531

I make enough money (fortunately), and budget my expenses well enough that I always have money for my loan payments, whether is my CC, LOC, or student loans.   I mix and match the three so that it looks like I pay off a bunch of debt every month, but I really don't get anywhere with it (you'd be surprised on how well this has boosted my credit score -- upper 700's/low 800's depending on which bureau you ask).   

But this shit irked me earlier.  I work hard for my money.   A few months ago I switched back to my CU (still had my checking/savings from when I was 2 years old in 1993) after working at a bank with different policies that I held my account.  The CU charged me $28 the **moment** the loan payment came through, even though it was in my ""savings,"" as I didn't want to accidentally spend too much and be short for my student loan payment.  Luckily, I had never had an OD in my life before that point, and even without asking, the teller reversed the fee, realizing that I was attempting to be responsible but the processor they used didn't see that.

So last night I had $225 in my savings, put aside for my loan payment to come out, and when I got to work this morning all I said was ""fuck.""  I have another $28 fee eating up the rest of my paycheck and making me live for the next week on credit.  Awesomely, the teller I was working with the previous time set me up for a sweep from my savings meaning if I overdrafted my checking, it would transfer from my savings and I would be in the clear without a $28 fee.

So sweet, I avoided a $28 fee.

But, herein lies the issue... The auto withdrawal is processed through the Fed ACH, the same department that puts your direct deposits in your account.  It opens at (I believe?) 3AM Eastern Time, which is 2AM Central Time.  So I get a debit from my account between 2-4AM, and Navient sent me [this e-mail](http://i.imgur.com/4MosZ95.png) AT 345 PM AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY TRY TO COLLECT THE FUNDS.

Yeah, I knew it was coming out on the 17th.  I knew the price was going to be $220 and some change.  But the fact I was sent an e-mail half a day later saying I have an ""upcoming payment due that will be automatically debited from your bank account"" is entirely fucked up, as the payment has already been processed.

* An independent audit of tens of thousands of votes [found 10.](http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2012/08/cases-voter-id-election-fraud-found-virtually-non-existent) Since these were instances of ex-felons, using their own identity to vote before their rights had been restored, voter ID would have had no effect.
 
 NONE were prosecuted as intentional fraud.

Five were ex-felons, voting before their rights had been restored.  One actually *was* a case of a non-citizen voting - - a German national.

* Interestingly, the investigation also uncovered 20 ex-felons who were illegally *denied* the right to vote.  So there were actually  three times more ex-felons kept from voting legally, than allowed to vote illegally.

I have a fairly well paying job and the ability to pay my loans in full plus more each month. I finished grad school last may and knew that my loans were coming out of deferrment soon. I thought it was November, but I have been obsessively checking the fedloan page almost daily to confirm.

I got an email this thursday morning at 3am (10/16) saying my loans were out of defferment. I got another one at 5am saying they were ""due on october 18."" That gave me two days notice to pay it. Not a huge deal, but still shady practice.

 I went to pay it this morning (10/18-the first time I have sat down at a computer since thursday) and even though they accept payments online I couldn't pick a weekend day to pay it. I had to set it up for Monday (10/20).

Four questions here:
1. Can they bill me and have it due within 2 days?
2. If a bill is ""due on (date)"" that gives you until midnight that day to pay it, correct?
3. If #2 is true, is there any legality to fedloans saying that you can't pay on a weekend but have your bill be due on a weekend day?

economy,"I have a question that's been bothering me for a while, about math/physics and money policy. How are the policies of the Fed any different than a driven harmonic oscillator?","In intro physics in college, we learned about ""harmonic oscillators"". 

A standard harmonic oscillator looks like a sine wave. It would be an Austrian economist's view of economic cycles. 

One kind is called a ""damped harmonic oscillator"". It's when a pendulum swings and gradually runs out of energy. This is what a Keynesian sees as economic cycles, and why they feel that stimulus is necessary, to fight the forces of deflation.

Another kind is called a ""driven harmonic oscillator"". This is like when you jump on a trampoline and time your jump to match the upswing of the trampoline surface. One feature of this is that it keeps magnifying the oscillation until it hits some final quantity (your legs are only so powerful or the trampoline breaks). A graph looks [like this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/oscdr2.html#c3).

Based on the way that the Fed responds to financial crises, I can't see how they're any different than a driven harmonic oscillator working with the resonant frequency of our economic cycles. They are designed to start pumping on the downswing and stop pumping when ""momentum"" is gained, and the amount increases proportionally to the downswing. 

If you look at charts of stimulus vs. total increase in money supply/equities prices, it looks exactly like a harmonic oscillator in a physics experiment.

*I'm using a throwaway account just as I've posted a lot of personal info on my other account, and I'd like to not be personally identified.*

I'm 24 years old, working a retail job as a supervisor, big box electronics store in Ontario Canada. I've graduated from a Marketing Communications diploma program, where I've struggled to find work in. I'm currently going through a cognitive behavioural therapy course to deal with my anxiety issues that may have culminated from dealing with stress of debt and other factors.
I have recently obtained (past 5-6 weeks) a second job thanks to a friend of mine, where I get 5-10 hours extra per week.

Here are the income stats:

* Full time job is $15.40/hr @40 hours per week  
* Part time job is $11.00/hr @7 hours per week  

Expenses

* Rent is **$675**, all inclusive, monthly
* Car is **$105** bi-weekly (3 years remaining on loan, 2007 Honda Civic, with 230,000km)
* Car insurance is **$280** monthly (cheapest possible, full coverage required for loan on car with Honda Canada)
* Student line of credit is **$106** monthly with ~8700$ remaining
* Phone plan, heavily discounted through work is **$69** monthly

Credit Cards :(

* $3500 owing on a store card, used to finance a computer for 24 months at 0% interest, but between being semi-irresponsible and using the card for cash advances, did not make a dent in debt, after 24 months. Interest rate is 29%
* $5500 owing on a high-interest *President's Choice Financial* Mastercard, 27.5% interest. Currently overlimit, at about $50.
* $1800 owing on a 14% Interest Visa card.
* $475 owing on a Mastercard used to finance car repairs.

My parents divorced while I was attending college, cutting off funding for planned unpaid internships, and living expenses. I used cash advances on the store card, and paid for a lot of things with the PC Mastercard, while working part time at the job I currently work at fulltime.

I commute to my full time job, 45 minutes away, and I burn roughly $350 in gas monthly. I've gotten a number of pay raises in the last 9 months at this job, going from $13 hourly to $15.40 due to good performance. Job security is not much of an issue, and there is potential for further promotion so leaving this job currently doesn't seem like a good option.

I have never missed a payment on any of these debts, but making the minimum payments is becoming harder and harder.

I'm not quite sure what to do, or what options I have. I have tried for consolidation loans but I have been denied by my own bank and a credit union.

Any suggestions as to what I can do would be greatly appreciated.

investing,Question about inflation/deflation and investing in physical gold/silver.,"**Past**

I'm 26 years old. I graduated from High School in 2006. I haven't been around long enough to really experience true economic hardship. I can't relate to people who lost everything in the DotCom burst, '87 Crash, and even 2008. I didn't understand what was happening. I didn't even know what a mortgage was back then. Principal? No idea. Interest, yeah I remember that word from Math Class. My assumption back then was communism = bad, capitalism = good. 

Years ago I associated money with hard work. Those who controlled money, worked hard. They had every right to that money. Myself included. I had around 100k in savings. I knew I worked hard. My thought was anyone who wasn't well off, it was their own fault. We live in America. We strive for the American Dream. The land of opportunity. I used to write songs and one of my lyrics was *""Gotta give props to the corporate monopolies, succeeding in a world that's square as the block be.""*

When 2008 happened I just thought okay, this is capitalism. Yeah it sucks, but too bad. The people that were foreclosed on deserved it.  They shouldn't have lived beyond their means. They should have budgeted! That's their fault. Boy, how wrong I was. The monetary system is flawed. Capitalism, communism, they are all systems designed to fail.

Between graduating in 2006 and working with my dad I have learned the art of the buy and sell. I have taken his business model and really transformed it. It's been a long road. I'm pretty well off financially. I have around 500k in the bank. I've worked very hard to get where I am.

My confidence in the USD$ has always been very high. It's safe and sound. The United States is amazing. It's a global economic powerhouse. Trust in the dollar. It's a global currency. I never really understood how the monetary system worked, until just within the last few years. I never questioned it. It just worked. Even after 2008 I thought wow - even on the brink of an economic collapse we're still here. I didn't question how that was possible or exactly know how or why we've been able to climb out of such a deep hole while breaking stock records year after year.  My assumption was a high stock market value is an immediate indication of how well our economy is doing. WRONG. On the surface everything looks cozy, but deep down all we've been doing is giving an alcoholic more alcohol.

Last year despite being a bull market I lost a nice sum of change. About 15-20% of my wealth. I'm not uspet about it. I promised myself 8 months ago I would never trade another stock no matter how good it looked. My mental health and my already secured financial situation weren't worth essentially gambling on. The emotional roller coaster was not a ride I was willing to take any longer. It really made me take a good hard look at myself, and also taught me fundamentals/speculation will almost always lose to technicals. I bought and sold GTAT for $90k last year with around a 20% loss. (Bought $17 Sell $14) Well GTAT is now trading for $0.40. I could have easily lost everything had I not kept my promise. Insanity : doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

**Present**

That brings me to the present. My understanding of the way the game is played, the way money is circulated and created really leads me to believe were in for some serious shit. If not in the next 6 months, then when? It's not a question of if, it's a question of when. 

In 2012 we were sinking our debt/deficit at more $10mil per min. It's 2014 now. There's this little fucked up thing called. **Quantitative Easing. QE1, QE2, QE3 have all but done absolutely nothing except attempt to distort reality; increase the deficit; and put more money in the hands of the rich thus increasing the wealth gap.** $80 billion/month of bond buying is absolutely criminal. It's not necessary. You can't justify it, even when QE3 was put into place it's not like the economy was sinking. It would make more sense to just give everyone in America that doesn't make more than $250k/year - each $100k. You never hear about QE on any sort of mainstream news network. It's so poorly understood by the public. It's smoke and mirrors. It's given a name that sounds scientific. It's a non-essential Wall Street bailout. The success of Wall Street is seen as a positive. It's shown as the government  but no one questions why? Turn on ABC or CNN and all you'll hear about is how well the stock market is doing! Wow, people are making a ton of money just like the 1999 Nasdaq.

2 months ago Peter Schiff said the Fed's will use any bullshit excuse they can to continue 0% interest and QE. I passed it off as a conspiracy. When the October taper and ending of QE was coming to scheduled, I couldn't be happier. This is great, they're finally going to stock giving stock markets Heroin. Here we are, it's the end of QE3's taper (October). Stocks are going down. It's not like they've never gone down before.They are currently experiencing a healthy correction. That's awesome! You fucking need it. You can't keep going up without EVER coming down. 

And then you know what happens?

James Bullard of the Federal Reserve comes out last week and basically says ok, we're actually probably going to reconsider QE3. Peter Schiff nailed it right on the fucking head. I'm sick and tired of the Fed stepping in. The stock market is completely fake. Fake numbers based on a fake economy. Wake up. Do you want to destroy the world in the next 10 years, or in the next 10 months? QE is absolutely sickening. This isn't capitalism. This isn't communism. This is currency manipulation. This is the biggest fraud in the history of mankind. Who's going to pay for it? No one. 

Debt = Money. Money = Debt. It's a system of economic slavery. I have watched every single 2008 documentary there is. I have watched Zeitgeist 1+2+3 countless times. This doesn't make any sense. 

**Future**

There is no end game. There is no plan to fix this. The debt will continue to exponentially rise higher. Politicians are not trained to solve problems. No amount of politics can fix the shit storm were in. We've gone from bubble after bubble. Each bubble was mended and a bandaid was put over it. The cure all? Increase the money supply. The ramifications of which haven't been examined. Yes, you can turn on the television and every once in awhile hear about how high the deficit are. No one is talking about collapse. Something that is very possible. The 2008 bailout fixed nothing. It was only mended by increasing the money supply, thus increasing the debt.

Gross debt as percentage of GDP.

Look at Greece. 
 
* 2007 - 104%
* 2010 - 123% 
* 2011 - 165%
* 2014 - 174%

United States

* 2007 - 62%
* 2010 - 92%
* 2011 - 102%

These figures alone are scary. Greece basically collapsed onto itself. Riots, looting, end times. The EURO bailed them out. Who's going to bail out the United States? No one.

I have read that if the dollar bursts we're basically looking at a 25 year long depression and the loss of about $100 Trillion dollars.

The bull/bear is almost cyclical. I don't understand how everyone ISN'T freaking out about something that is so much more important than stock prices falling a few points. I don't understand how with so much volatility and warnings - everyone is believing this will NEVER happen. So they put all their long money into PCLN. The collapse of the dollar is the biggest threat we face right now. More than Ebola, Global Warming and ISIS. More than anything. Yes I know you can short the market, but I'm not looking to make a quick turn around on what I have. I'm looking at 5 years down the road. You can short the market, but if the dollar has NO value as it's not backed by anything then really? Fuck Nixon for creating Fiat.

The Chinese Real Estate bubble is also very real. It will cripple EVERYTHING as we know it if and when it happens. If China’s housing market crashes, the ripple effect could be even more cataclysmic for its economy than the recent housing market collapses in the US and Europe were for their economies. The likelihood of it happening is high. It happened to us. We didn't see it coming. As outsiders looking in, you just have to ask China what the fuck they think they're doing. They aren't stopping either. Our bubble burst when we had X% of our growth in relation to our GDP. I don't have the exact figures, but China's real estate bubble is already well beyond United States X% GDP. I think its double or triple that.

I have started to prepare myself and my family for whatever comes next. Even if it doesn't come tomorrow, I'd rather be safe than sorry. A few years ago I wouldn't have ever believed this shit, because I'm not one for conspiracies. Now I'm going Rick Grimes and preparing for the worst.

**My question is - what are safe investments? What should I do to prepare? Should I invest in physical gold? Physical silver? If the dollar collapses will there be any value left? Gold is gold. Owning gold in physical form, what's not to benefit from it? I know gold prices are still on their way down. I have heard several analysis' say it could go anywhere from $600 to $1100. Where do you guys see gold being at the end of the year? The end of next year? What would be a good buy in price?**

**What is the correlation between inflation/deflation/stagflation along with Gold/Silver prices?**

politics,Gerrymandering Analysis : A How-To,"**Installing the tools**

We only really need two things to get the ball rolling here. The first is Congressional District GIS data.  GIS data, or ""Geographic Information System Data"", is an array, or table, of data that draws boundaries or depicts points on some topographic space. In addition to the actual points and boundaries (like states, roads, cities, etc.), GIS data usually includes information regarding the kind of projection used to encode the information. Luckily, we don't have to go about drawing these lines ourselves - the United States Census Bureau publishes this information to keep us voters informed!

Navigate to the [Census Bureau's data download page](http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefilesrd13/main) and select ""Congressional Districts"" from the dropdown menu. Then click ""submit"" and download ""All states in one national file"" for the 113th (at time of writing) Congress - the resulting down is a .zip, so you can use WinZip or (preferably) 7-zip to extract the archive.

Now we need a tool to view, modify, and analyze the data! ArcGIS is a popular proprietary solution, but for this exercise, everything will be free - so we'll use [QGIS, an open-source GIS solution](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) that does exactly what we need. Navigate to the QGIS download page and download the appropriate version of the software.

After installing QGIS, launch ""QGIS Desktop"" to get to the main QGIS view. GIS data is usually depicted in 'layers' (for example, a topogrophic map with a layer of hiking trails on top it), so we're going to add a layer of our own by clicking ""Layer"" -&gt; ""Add Vector Layer..."" to open the vector layer import dialogue. Click the 'Browse' button and navigate to the folder containing the downloaded Congressional District data, then select the .shp file, click 'Open', and then 'Open' again in the layer import dialogue to confirm the new layer.

Voila! Before you should be the map that delineates the districts that elect the lower house of our representative democracy.

Now, some people may disagree, but to ease browsing the map as well as simplifying the calculations we'll do later on, we're going to reduce this map to the lower 48 states. Nowadays, Alaska, Hawaii, and the territories don't have many gerrymandering problems. 

Select the entire continental United States by changing the ""Select single feature"" button   to ""Select feature by freehand""  and draw a shape around the lower 48. Now, with all those districts selected, right click the layer that you just created and select ""Open attribute table."" This should open a table where each row corresponds to a congressional voting district. You may have to click on one of the cells (the internal cells, not the row number!) to make the highlighting appear. Click the ""invert selection"" button  to select those rows not in the continental United States, then enable editing  (you must do this in order to modify the table) and then delete the newly selected features with the ""delete features"" button  and finally save those changes with the ""save changes"" button .

**Doing the analysis**

You may have noticed that the Attribute Table contains some interesting information - lets take a closer look. 

I have to admit, none of these columns are all that self-explanatory. The STATEFP column is the Federal Information Processing Standard State Code, and the NAMELSAD column is the congressional voting district within that state. However, while this information is informative, it's not all that useful. With editing enabled, click on the ""New column"" button  name it ""AREA"", change the type to ""Decimal number (real)"", set the width to 10 and the precision to 10, then confirm the new column by clicking 'ok'. This should create a new column in the attribute table, albeit filled with the value NULL. To populate this column, again, with editing enabled, click the ""Field calculator"" button  to open the calculator menu. Here, we can define what attributes or calculations we want to put in our columns.

Make sure to have ""Only update selected features"" unselected (we want to update all features), then check ""Update existing field"" and select the AREA column we just created in the dropdown menu. Expand the ""Geometry"" menu inside the Function List and double click $area - this will add the function to our columns calculation as well as display the help in the right pane. 

Confirm this column by clicking ""ok"" and you should see your new AREA column  populated with the areas (in the unit of your projection - mine was NAD83). When you have this working, go ahead and repeat the process for perimeter. Then, create another column named RATIO which is the ratio of the district's perimeter to its area. This does not have to reference the other two columns, one can simply put $perimeter / $area in the Expression pane.

Once you've got all those columns together, sort the attributes (in both directions) table by the RATIO value and explore the districts by clicking the ""Zoom map to selected rows"" button.

**Perimeter / Area Ratio**

We've already created this one! 
    
    RATIO: $perimeter / $area

This is simple, though at a glance, effective metric for our polygons : ""if it's a lot bigger around the sides than it is in the middle, its probably an odd shape."" [We can see it detects some really messed up shapes.](http://i.imgur.com/SG8mMAr.png)

It turns out that the RATIO property is not a good metric because it doesn't scale well with the district's size. [Consider the limit of the RATIO of a circle as its AREA and PERIMETER approached zero.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=limit%28%282*pi*r%29%2F%28pi*r%5E2%29%29+as+r+approaches+0+from+the+right)

Now you don't even have to apply L'Hospital's Rule here to figure out that this approaches positive infinity for sensical values of the radius. Thus, as the area of our polygons decreases, the more exaggerated their RATIO becomes, which is no good.

Granted, congressional districts are far from perfect circles, but the same goes for generalized shapes (here's equilateral triangle and square). This is because AREA has a larger dimension than PERIMETER - therefore the RATIO property will not scale with the size of congressional voting districts. Think of all the cities that have several districts due to their population - those districts would be unfairly evaluated by the RATIO metric because of their small size compared the larger, multi-county or even at-large districts. Fear not, the next metric addresses this problem.

**Compactness**

If you were wondering how to contend with the dimensionality discrepancy between PERIMETER and AREA in RATIO, you're probably thinking too hard. The most common definition of compactness simply squares the PERIMETER in the Perimeter-Area ratio:

    COMPACTNESS: ($perimeter^2) / ($area)
    
Hah! Just slap another dimension of PERIMETER in there. That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see how it turns out - go ahead and create a COMPACTNESS column and sort your districts in descending order; you'll see that this metric works pretty well. 

[Maryland's infamous 3rd district has an insane compactness metric.](http://i.imgur.com/UnNWMvg.png)

**Circularity (Normalized compactness)**

Compactness seemed to work out pretty well, but if we take a little closer at the math like we did with RATIO, we see that the limit approaches a constant, specifically 4*pi. The CIRCULARITY metric just normalizes COMPACTNESS by inverting it (making low scores bad scores) and factoring in a constant (clamping the values between 0 and 1).

    CIRCULARITY: 4 * $pi * $area / ($perimeter^2)

**Normalized Perimeter**

This metric is the inverse ratio of the shape's perimeter to the perimeter of a equivalent-area circle.
   
    NORMPERIMETER: (2 * $pi * sqrt($area / $pi)) / $perimeter

**Concavity**

This one is a little more complex. The Convexity of a shape is the inverse ratio of the perimeter to that of the shape's convex hull. This can't be done with simple arithmetic on geometric data - for this, we need QGIS to help us out.

In the QGIS main view, select Vector-&gt;Geoprocessing Tools-&gt;Convex Hulls to bring up the Convex Hulls dialogue. Make sure the ""Use only selected features"" option is not checked and then select ""Create convex hulls based on input field"", specifying the GEOID (the column that provides the unique key for the district's geographic information) as the target column. Then, click the ""Browse"" button and select a place to save the resulting GIS data. Finally, after hitting 'ok', when the calculations are finished QGIS should prompt you to add the convex hulls as a layer to the current view - say yes.

Now that we have the convex hulls created, we want to relate each district to its convex hull - if you are familiar with databases, this is akin to the JOIN operation. Right click on the district layer in the Layers pane, then select ""Properties"". Select ""Joins"" from the left navigation pane and then click ""Add vector join"" button . Once in the vector join dialogue, make sure the convex hulls layer is selected as the join layer, select 'outID' as the join column, and make sure both ""Cache join layer in virtual memory"" and ""Create attribute index on join field"" are both not checked. Press 'Ok' and then ""Apply"" to create the join. Now, the attribute table should have the appropriate fields we need to construct the CONCAVITY metric.

    CONCAVITY: ""ConvexHulls_Perimeter"" / (2 * $pi * sqrt($area / $pi))

(where ConvexHulls_Perimeter is the name of the column containing the perimeter of that district's convex hull)

Note: if the districts are masked by the convex hulls, un-check the box next to the convex hull layer, right click the layer and select ""update drawing order"".

**Viable Interior Index**

Some districts are just gonna look funny. Those districts that border rivers (like the winding Mississippi) or include islands (the South Texas coast, Florida Keys) will inevitably have distorted metrics due to their geography.

We can address this in two ways: first, we could use the shape simplification algorithms or we could use the Viable Interior Index mentioned earlier. However, both methods still destroy the highly-granular polygon data. 

The viable interior index uses a shape [like this](http://i.imgur.com/wZhdcD3.png) to calculate its metric.

We need to decide how much ""buffer"" we want to use to find the viable interior for each district - obviously, we want it to scale with the area of the district, so we should probably use a normalized area measurement. To calculate the VIABLE_INTERIOR, we'll use viable interiors that are are contracted by %10 the radius of the district's equivalent area circle. QGIS can calculate this shape through the ""Geoprocessing Tools &gt; Buffer(s)"" tool.

We can use this information to create the VIABLE_INTERIOR Index metric:

    VIABLE_INTERIOR: ""viable_interior_area"" / $area

Where ""viable_interior_area"" is the area column of the viable interior shape joined to the attribute table.

**Conclusion**

This analysis is purely geometric - there are always more ways to look at the data, to include demographics, population density, transit routes, etc.; I encourage you to explore and, most importantly, equip yourself with the tools to make your own decisions.",technology,1413663248
investing,Looking Forward : Preparing for The Dollar Collapse. Inflation/Deflation/Stagflation. Chinese Real Estate Bubble. 25 Year - $100 Trillion Depression. 70% Loss in Stocks. Gold/Silver Investing. End times. Zeitgeist.,"I'm aware this is long. Did my best to make it not look like a big wall of text. Still looks like one though.

**Past**

I'm 26 years old. I graduated from High School in 2006. I haven't been around long enough to really experience true economic hardship. I can't relate to people who lost everything in the DotCom burst, '87 Crash, and even 2008. I didn't understand what was happening. I didn't even know what a mortgage was back then. Principal? No idea. Interest, yeah I remember that word from Math Class. My assumption back then was communism = bad, capitalism = good. 

Years ago I associated money with hard work. Those who controlled money, worked hard. They had every right to that money. Myself included. I had around 100k in savings. I knew I worked hard. My thought was anyone who wasn't well off, it was their own fault. We live in America. We strive for the American Dream. The land of opportunity. I used to write songs and one of my lyrics was *""Gotta give props to the corporate monopolies, succeeding in a world that's square as the block be.""*

When 2008 happened I just thought okay, this is capitalism. Yeah it sucks, but too bad. The people that were foreclosed on deserved it.  They shouldn't have lived beyond their means. They should have budgeted! That's their fault. Boy, how wrong I was. The monetary system is flawed. Capitalism, communism, they are all systems designed to fail.

Between graduating in 2006 and working with my dad I have learned the art of the buy and sell. I have taken his business model and really transformed it. It's been a long road. I'm pretty well off financially. I have around 500k in the bank. I've worked very hard to get where I am.

My confidence in the USD$ has always been very high. It's safe and sound. The United States is amazing. It's a global economic powerhouse. Trust in the dollar. It's a global currency. I never really understood how the monetary system worked, until just within the last few years. I never questioned it. It just worked. Even after 2008 I thought wow - even on the brink of an economic collapse we're still here. I didn't question how that was possible or exactly know how or why we've been able to climb out of such a deep hole while breaking stock records year after year.  My assumption was a high stock market value is an immediate indication of how well our economy is doing. WRONG. On the surface everything looks cozy, but deep down all we've been doing is giving an alcoholic more alcohol.

Last year despite being a bull market I lost a nice sum of change. About 15-20% of my wealth. I'm not uspet about it. I promised myself 8 months ago I would never trade another stock no matter how good it looked. My mental health and my already secured financial situation weren't worth essentially gambling on. The emotional roller coaster was not a ride I was willing to take any longer. It really made me take a good hard look at myself, and also taught me fundamentals/speculation will almost always lose to technicals. I bought and sold GTAT for $90k last year with around a 20% loss. (Bought $17 Sell $14) Well GTAT is now trading for $0.40. I could have easily lost everything had I not kept my promise. Insanity : doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

**Present**

That brings me to the present. My understanding of the way the game is played, the way money is circulated and created really leads me to believe were in for some serious shit. If not in the next 6 months, then when? It's not a question of if, it's a question of when. 

In 2012 we were sinking our debt/deficit at more $10mil per min. It's 2014 now. There's this little fucked up thing called. **Quantitative Easing. QE1, QE2, QE3 have all but done absolutely nothing except attempt to distort reality; increase the deficit; and put more money in the hands of the rich thus increasing the wealth gap.** $80 billion/month of bond buying is absolutely criminal. It's not necessary. You can't justify it, even when QE3 was put into place it's not like the economy was sinking. It would make more sense to just give everyone in America that doesn't make more than $250k/year - each $100k. You never hear about QE on any sort of mainstream news network. It's so poorly understood by the public. It's smoke and mirrors. It's given a name that sounds scientific. It's a non-essential Wall Street bailout. The success of Wall Street is seen as a positive. It's shown as the government doing good by the people, but no one questions why? What consequence? Stocks are going up! Turn on ABC or CNN and all you'll hear about is how well the stock market is doing! Wow, people are making a ton of money just like the 1999 Nasdaq.

2 months ago Peter Schiff said the Fed's will use any bullshit excuse they can to continue 0% interest and QE. I passed it off as a conspiracy. When the October taper and ending of QE was coming to scheduled, I couldn't be happier. This is great, they're finally going to stock giving stock markets Heroin.

As outsiders looking in, you just have to ask China what the fuck they're thinking??? They aren't stopping either. Our bubble burst when we had X% of our growth in relation to our GDP.

**My question's are** 

* What are safe investments? 
* What should I do to prepare? 
* Should I invest in physical gold? Physical silver?
* If the dollar collapses will there be any value left? 
* Owning gold or silver in physical form, what's not to benefit from it? 
* What is the correlation between inflation/deflation/stagflation along with Gold/Silver prices?
* What is the general correlation of Gold Prices and the strength of the dollar? Dollar is strong right now. Prices are going down.
* Where do you guys see gold being at the end of the year? The end of next year? Where is a good bounce?
* When are we going to see things really start to break down? 

I see the indices bouncing from the recent lows, only to form a Head and Shoulder back on its way down.

I know gold prices are still on their way down. I have heard several analysis' say it could go anywhere from $600 to $1100.  I can't find an exact correlation of gold prices and stock market prices, along with the USD being as strong as it is.  Gold prices seem to still be going down even when there is even less confidence

To invest in 100k in Gold is not out of the question for me. I'm not looking to make a ""quick buck"" on it. I'm looking at it is a safe haven. The same people that predicted the last 3 bubbles are predicting the same bubble forming as we speak.

personalfinance,Is this the best plan for my student loans and retirement?,"Long time lurker and figured I need to get some confirmation or see what else I may not have thought of.  

So I am in the military, medical field to be exact and because of this I think I have the best plan for myself but I wanted to reach out to see else I could be doing.  Let me give you the details first then how I am going about it.  My income is about $78K. Only $53K is taxable.  Additionally I also have a annual special pay bonus of $15K which currently goes straight into TSP (government 401K.) Okay so here is my debt.  $125K in student loans, mortgage $80K, two cars loans  $42K.  Total debt $247K.  No credit card debt but I am currently renting $1,600 month since my house with a mortgage is not where I am at the moment.  I rent out my house to family for about $100 over my mortgage to cover any incidentals.  They take care good care of it so make it worth it to give them a deal.  

So here is my current plan I am using the Federal Loan Forgiveness Plan for my student loans.  Due to family of 5 and they only look at taxable income I am only paying $30/month and will be forgiven after 120 monthly payments.  The FLFP uses the IBR repayment method and has to get updated every year. I know my taxable income will rise but shouldn't be going near what it would be paying for a ten year repayment term.  I am keeping my $15K special pay in my TSP 401K to keep my taxable income down and I am planning on increasing to max out my retirement @ $17.5K starting in 2015.  

Currently at end of year I owe in federal taxes while claiming exempt.  That's what I get for having three kids and I live in Florida as well.  Eventually I want convert $5.5K of the TSP into a roth but I am thinking that the less taxable income the better right now and to do that in a couple of years when I have finally have to pay federal taxes.    

So what do you think think PF are my student loans and retirement being executed properly.",finance,1413664611
dogecoin,A Statement from Landon Merrill,"My name is Landon Merrill, but most of you know me as TheBoffin, or just as Boff.  With everything that has been brought into the light over the past few days, I figured it would be best for me to make a statement of some sorts, so here it is.

I first began my interactions with “Alex Green” during the late part of December 2013.  We met in an internet chatroom (IRC) specifically for Dogecoin.  We started talking, and bouncing ideas off each other, and we hit it off.  We fed off each other’s ideas.  We soon began talking in depth about Moolah, and what could be done with it.  I signed up for his service, and instantly thought to myself that I had to be a part of this.  This is going to be big.  That is when the first round of “PIE” opened up.  I invested 500,000 DOGE (1.1 BTC at the time) but kept wanting more.  Eventually we began talking as business partners, and I was offered the role of Head of US Operations.  I immediately wanted myself to be protected, and incorporated Moolah.io Inc in the state of Wyoming.  I opened up a bank account with Wells Fargo, and we were in business. Yes, I am omitting the entire “Treats” formula from this equation.

Business was doing great.  Storefronts were working as planned, and life was good.  Sponsorships happened, tips were given, and Doge was going to the moon, or so I thought.  It was the middle of this year when I did become worried about a few minor things, not having access to certain features, or control over certain situations.  At the same time, I thought very simply to myself, would I trust this person whom I have never met?  I shrugged off my doubts simply as me worrying too much about nothing.
Things continued on, slander was stated, angry comments and legal threats were being thrown around like candy at a parade.  Here I sat, wondering not only what the hell was going on, but also what was true, and what was FUD?  Who do I believe?  Whose side is the right one to be on?  I was lost, confused, and to be completely honest, a bit scared.

    Then there was the video.  Aaah, the lovely video.  
    I’m sure most of you have seen it, and at first, I was furious that it was leaked.  
    Ben, I am still pissed at you for that, but we’re not going there right now :)

Let’s skip a whole bunch of the bullshit, and get to the part that everyone wants to know.  Is Moolah a scam, and if so, who was (is) involved, etc.  Here is what I can tell you.

CryptoCurrency,A Statement from Landon Merrill,"My name is Landon Merrill, but most of you know me as TheBoffin, or just as Boff.  With everything that has been brought into the light over the past few days, I figured it would be best for me to make a statement of some sorts, so here it is.

I first began my interactions with “Alex Green” during the late part of December 2013.  We met in an internet chatroom (IRC) specifically for Dogecoin.  We started talking, and bouncing ideas off each other, and we hit it off.  We fed off each other’s ideas.  We soon began talking in depth about Moolah, and what could be done with it.  I signed up for his service, and instantly thought to myself that I had to be a part of this.  This is going to be big.  That is when the first round of “PIE” opened up.  I invested 500,000 DOGE (1.1 BTC at the time) but kept wanting more.  Eventually we began talking as business partners, and I was offered the role of Head of US Operations.  I immediately wanted myself to be protected, and incorporated Moolah.io Inc in the state of Wyoming.  I opened up a bank account with Wells Fargo, and we were in business. Yes, I am omitting the entire “Treats” formula from this equation.

Business was doing great.  Storefronts were working as planned, and life was good.  Sponsorships happened, tips were given, and Doge was going to the moon, or so I thought.  It was the middle of this year when I did become worried about a few minor things, not having access to certain features, or control over certain situations.  At the same time, I thought very simply to myself, would I trust this person whom I have never met?  I shrugged off my doubts simply as me worrying too much about nothing.
Things continued on, slander was stated, angry comments and legal threats were being thrown around like candy at a parade.  Here I sat, wondering not only what the hell was going on, but also what was true, and what was FUD?  Who do I believe?  Whose side is the right one to be on?  I was lost, confused, and to be completely honest, a bit scared.

    Then there was the video.  Aaah, the lovely video.  
    I’m sure most of you have seen it, and at first, I was furious that it was leaked.  
    Ben, I am still pissed at you for that, but we’re not going there right now :)

Let’s skip a whole bunch of the bullshit, and get to the part that everyone wants to know.  Is Moolah a scam, and if so, who was (is) involved, etc.  Here is what I can tell you.  I knew that Alex Green went by the name Ryan in real life, to some people.  I did not know that was his real name, middle name, what it was, or what it meant.  I have many friends that go by names that are not their birth name, so I really did not put any thought into it.  Here is what I know to be fact.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinancing question,"Hi PF! I am looking for some insight regarding my current mortgage.  

Some background, I bought a house back in 2012 with an interest rate of 3.625%. The mortgage is an FHA and we only put 3.5% down so we pay PMI of $140/month. (I realize this wasn't a great move).  

So my current plan is to get to 22% LTV on the mortgage before 5 years so that PMI will be removed. However, since mortgage rates are still low I am wondering if it makes sense to refinance now to remove PMI. I understand we would need to pay closing costs again so maybe that makes this scenario a wash in the end and if anything bearing the cost now would be less optimal.  

Also I believe the house would have to be reassessed, not sure that would have an impact. Also if refinancing did make sense I am wondering if it would be wise to move to a 15 year, though I realize this would add some risk.

personalfinance,Creditor uses avalanche method when applying extra payments to my student loans. Why is the avalanche shrinking?,"I have 4 student loans with varying interest rates:

 * $11,000@3.4%, now $10,150

 * $5,500@4.5%, now $5,075

 * $5,257@5.6%, now $4,850

 * $7,000@6.5%, now $3,205

My minimum payment is $290 monthly, but I've been paying $600 monthly for 7 months now.  The extra payment is obviously going towards the high interest loan - yet every month the amount of my total payment going towards the principal of the highest interest loan keeps falling by a couple of dollars (while the amount of principal going towards the low interest loans are obviously increasing).  Back in April, $350 went towards the high interest loan, but this month only $341 went towards the same loan.

Why isn't the amount of money going towards the principal of my highest interest loan increasing?  Every payment I make should decrease the amount of money being paid towards interest in the proceeding month, so there should theoretically be more money available to put towards principal.

I almost have a hunch that my loan servicer is doing something weird, as they only tell me the total amount of principal and interest I pay - I have to deduce where my money is going by tracking the amount of principal left in each loan after every payment has been applied.  This is how I've been tracking how much principal gets paid off on each loan.

It should also be noted that I had a derogatory mark removed recently that could be the cause of the point jump, what I don't understand is the payment history change...and ideas?

Thanks for any info!

""you are responsible for investing your account in one or any combation of the plan's investment options. 
1) a stable value fund tha tprovides you with a lower risk/return option to preserve principal
2) bond fund provides you with a fixed income investment for portfolio diversification. bond fund returns can change as interest rates move up and donw 
3) stock funds that provide you with investments that have returns which can change as the stock market goes up and down""

personalfinance,My Dad just disowned me. What things do I need to pay for?,"**I realized I broke this into 2 parts, writing more than I had planned. For simplicity responding, I have labeled financial part A and emotional B**
**A**  
My Dad is a single parent. We have had a rough financial situation since about 2 years ago, partly due to my college tuition, partly due to personal things like my dog needing multiple surgeries and my father breaking his foot and needing surgery. He has a well paying job (around 100k, although much of it is going towards paying off loans and IRS fees,most of which end this December). I have been working to help him pay for me, him, everything, but sometimes I have had hours cut, or had school things arise, and some weeks I have had to borrow money from friends who know I will pay them back, but this tended to delay when I could deposit the money for my Dad to use. He would never let me borrow, and would instead go out and take ridiculous loans at like 80% interest rates, so I never told him.  
  
Tonight I came home from a night without my phone, and for various reasons, one of which being that he thinks I had a ''f**k you attitude'' to depositing these checks, he essentially said i'm on my own. I love him, and I understand his reasons, and I'm not looking for sympathy, just advice.   

I can make a paycheck of $1000 every 2 weeks, for a total of about $2000 per month. My rent is $700, I have alotted $400 for food, and I have about $1500 I owe various good friends, most of which is to a single one who is very understanding, but I want to pay this off asap, so I have alotted $300 dollars a month to paying debts. I'm hoping to pay for community college (real cheap), and save for university with financial aid. 
     What does a person absolutely have to pay for himself? I'm guessing health insurance, but I'm exhausted and can't think of much else right now. Any tips would be great, links to a similar thread would be awesome too.
  
**for those maybe interested in the emotional aspect**  

**B**  

I love my dad, and he loves me. We have been texting (it is incredibly late), and ultimately we ended on a note where he said ''call me tomorrow, and maybe we can work it out.''   
  Here's my problem. I am experiencing something strange, where before, even when I screwed up, my dad would always say no matter what he was rooting for me, and he would help me get back on track if things went wrong. Now, this just sounds to me like a looming threat, where any time I mess up, or heck maybe just don't call for 2 days straight, I could come home to a text saying ''good luck out there pal, you're on your own.'' That's the kind of relationship I want with a loanshark (obviously not perfect analogy), not with the person I love most in the world, and this whole situation has shattered that.  
  Most people who get put into a situation like this probably wouldn't have a great job ready to take them and pay for their housing and food and everything they could need, but I kind of do. The logical side of me (incredibly persuasively) argues that I should let my Dad help me, because anything that helps jumpstart me to a better life in the future is good, but the emotional side is still reeling from the shock, and feels like it would be better to preserve the picture of my Dad loving me, missing me, checking how I am, than to take the aid and picture him dangling this over my head.

personalfinance,"Should I invest a study loan into ETFs, given that I have enough savings to pay off the debt?","*Scroll down for the TL;DR, felt like /r/personalfinance seemed the best place for this topic, as I'm merely informing on whether I'm making a reasonable choice with taking out a study loan/deliberately building up debt.*

Currently, I live at home, studying, while earning roughly $ 20,000 a year. My situation will remain like this until August next year, when I'll move out and start living in another city in the Netherlands, where I'll rent a students room and start with my last year to obtain my masters degree. 

I've saved up around $ 30,000, of which I hold $ 10,000 on a regular bank account at 1,2% interest and $ 20,000 in short term deposit at 2,2% interest. Nothing exciting here.

Every month, I save roughly $ 750. Unfortunately, in the Netherlands we don't have something comparable to an IRA, and tax deferred retirement saving isn't attractive for me at this very moment. My wage is relatively low and I don't pay any taxes due to my deductible study and medical costs (nothing chronic). Long story short, I'm planning to invest this money in ETFs.

Now, once I'll start with my masters degree in Augustus, my monthly expenses will increase, my income will decrease (albeit it just being for 10 months). It won't be a problem to cope with this, but that doesn't withhold the possibility to lend money during that year.

During my masters degree, I can monthly lend $ 1,300 at an interest rate of 0,88%(!). My consideration is actually, would it be sensible to lend this money and put it (partly) towards my monthly investments? The accumulated debt would be deductible from my taxes, so I won't the Dutch 1,2% 'wealth tax' over the money. Basically, it would be a very interesting loan which I can put towards my investments. Over the long run, I definitely expect the ETFs to yield more than 0,88% which I have to pay over this study debt. On top of that, this study debt can be paid back over 35(!) years.

personalfinance,Help Me Fix My Credit Score!,"Hi everyone!

I need some help understanding/protecting my credit score. (""Fix"" isn't the right word--my understanding is that it's actually pretty decent right now.)

* According to Discover, my FICO credit score was 795 at the beginning of October.

I have two worries; the biggest one is my student loans:

* When I graduated in 2012, I had 14 separate loans with three different servicers totaling $68, 466.54.
* I have been paying these down as aggressively as possible. I currently have 6 separate loans with three different servicers totaling $28, 528.71
* I'd planned to pay this down to 0 loans totaling $0 (dreaming of the day!) within the next 12-24 months. 
* However, I recently heard that paying these loans off early will hurt my credit score. (For example, at least one of these loans has a repayment term of 218 months. I'm hoping to pay it off before I hit 48 months.)
* I've  been paying the loans in order of highest interest rate to lowest, but should I factor in the repayment terms, too? (Shortest to longest?)
* Is paying the remaining loans down to $0 a bad idea? Should I leave a manageable balance to pay over a longer period of time? And if so, what factors would I consider when determining that balance?
* In general, how should I balance the issue of paying less money on my loans over time (i.e., paying them off ASAP) versus protecting my credit score? (I can tell you, pretty much all of my money is going to these loans so I'm going to need a good credit score for the future!)

My second worry is my credit cards:

* I have three credit cards: Discover, Visa, and a store card (NY&amp;Co.)
* The Discover credit limit is $7,500. In the past three months, I have averaged utilizing 16.3% of that. 
* The Visa credit limit is $3,400. In the past three months, I have averaged utilizing 24% of that.
* Note: My spending in the past three months was relatively high due to trips and a number of special occasions. I'm also trying to stick to a stricter budget, so (hopefully for my budget, but not hopefully for this exercise) those percentages will likely go down.
* I rarely use the store credit card. I believe I opened it in 2013, and I *think* I've used it all of three times. (Call it four because I need to buy new pants next week.)
* Should I close the store card? Is it harming me to keep it open?
* Any insight on my habits with Discover and Visa? I'd like to keep both of them open, but I'd also like to know if there are things I should change in order to keep my credit score high.

I can provide more information, especially regarding the loans, if necessary.

personalfinance,Snowballing vs. Avalanching and Cashflow,"So my fiance and I are getting our financial house in order and we're debating how to get down  our credit card debt. I make more than she does, so I'm the one that fills out more bills than she does, and the notion of paying one less bill per month is a rewarding notion. However, she argues, and rightfully so, that avalanching will cost less in the long term.

As I was thinking about this, a question occurred to me and I wanted to bring it to others because I'm not great at math. So, let's say I have $2,000. One credit card with a $2,000 balance at 18% with a minimum payment of $67, then another with a $6,000 balance at 29% with a minimum payment of $180.

If I put that $2k toward the higher interest card, would that lower the monthly payment more than the $67/mo. I'm paying toward the other card? Basically the common argument I see for snowballing is that it increases cashflow to pay off other bills because you have one less bill to pay. My concern is that this just looks like I would have more cashflow because I have one less bill, when I could actually have more cashflow by lowering the minimum monthly payment on the higher interest card.

I'm bad at math, so I thought I would ask others to see if my reasoning makes sense. It seems to me that a credit card with a higher interest rate would have a quicker rising minimum monthly payment and by paying it down quickly, it would proportionally drop faster than a lower interest rate card.

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on how to allocate my income wrt debt, retirement, and other savings","Hi, I am looking for the kind of advice that seems to be very common here. My finances are a little complicated so I will try to give as much info as necessary but please feel free to ask for more. 

I am married but my husband and I tend to keep our finances more separate than most couples. We are more comfortable with things this way and I don't have any complaints about it. Because of that I don't have all the details (exact numbers) about his accounts but I can get it if it's necessary to get advice here.

The broad strokes wrt my husband's finances:

* salaried at $115k
* usually gets 10% annual bonus
* also gets to buy company stock at a discount and sell it twice a year (usually nets $1k to $3k twice a year)
* is starting a small business and putting a lot of his income into that; no profits yet
* 401k with about $50k, company matches so he maxes out his contributions

My finances:

* salaried at $52,000/year takehome about $3500/month
* have a mandatory pension contribution of $310/month, currently about $5000 in pension contribution account
* $45k student loan debt (at 1-2% interest)
* daycare $950/month
* car insurance $50/month

I don't have any other bills I'm personally responsible for. My husband pays the rent (since he makes a little over 2x what I make, we figured it was just easier if I pay daycare and he pays rent -- also bc I have a dependent care FSA plan through my work). Our utilities are bundled into our rent, except cable which his work pays for bc he works from home. Our cars are paid off and I walk to work so we don't spend much on gas.

Food and other household stuff (cleaning supplies, toiletries, diapers) we pay for out of a joint account.

We also have an e-fund of about 6 months expenses liquid that my husband has set aside.

My financial goals:

1. Get a much better retirement account going. I don't 100% understand the pension and I think that unless I stay at this job for &gt;5 years then I don't actually get anything out of it, and I'm not sure I'll be there that long. I think I need to start a separate account, but I don't know what kind. My employer doesn't offer a 401k and our income is too high to get any benefit from a tax-deferred IRA. What kind of retirement account should I have and how many dollars should I be putting in it every month?

2. Pay off student loans. The interest rate is so low that this is actually not a huge priority for me but I guess the sooner it's gone the better.

3. Save up for a downpayment for a house. I think we will need $50,000 to $100,000 to put 10-20% down. We don't have a dedicated house savings fund right now.

4. Save up to be able to buy my next car outright instead of financing it. I have a 9 year old Mazda with 160,000 miles on it. I don't mind driving it until the wheels fall off but I will need another car some point in my life and it would be great to be able to buy it free and clear.

5. Setting aside money for my daughter's college fund so that she doesn't have to live under the burden of student loans that I've had to.

I went to test drive the car and it drives awesome. When we talked money the total amount with tax is 11500. The interest rate they offered me was 13%. That seemed way high. Is that what i should expect with my credit score? I also submitted some car loan apps at different credit unions.

personalfinance,How to Build Credit (Without Getting in Too Much Debt),"Background: I found a job and currently migrating to US (I'm Asian) and I have no idea about 'building a credit' system. Debt is not in my dictionary and I am allergic to interest rates, mortgage, credit cards and loans. But they say you have to 'slowly build your credit' in US.

I need a step-by-step plan to 'build a credit' but at the same time not lose my hard earned savings (around 150k) to interests and payables and stuff. My Plan A was to buy a mobile home and buy a used car (without getting mortgage and stuff: I know how to live not beyond my means). I wish I can do things by cash but I know that's not the way.

personalfinance,"About $150k in school loans. Good credit, paying about $1000/month currently. 25 year repayment term. What can I do?","Hopefully some people here can offer me advice...

I graduated from a graduate program in 2011 with about $160,000 in loans.  I have two federal Stafford loans right now at a fixed rate of 6.875%.  The total balance I still owe on the loans is $145,896.00.

For the past 3 years, I've been paying about $1000 per month on these loans.  At this rate (I'm 29 now) I won't have them paid off until I'm 50 or so, which I cannot stand the thought of.  I currently make roughly $100k per year and have about $50k saved up (haven't really made any major purchases or taken any major vacations since I graduated and started working).  I pay $1500/month for rent and $300/month for my car payment.  No other real extravagant expenses other than that.

What can I do to pay my student loans off faster (preferably 10 or 15 years) without paying something insane like $2000 per month?

I've been considering refinancing with SoFi as they can apparently give me 10 or 15 years at about $1300-1600 per month at a slightly lower interest rate, but I've heard mixed reviews from them and something about giving up the benefits I have by paying the Department of Education back directly (stuff they offer like flexible repayment plans, etc.)

If anyone has any suggestions, I would be ecstatic to hear them.  All any of my friends/family can tell me is to start making double payments, which is not only a ridiculous amount of money to be forking over every month, but would also only cut down repayment term to about 15 years if I paid $2000 every single month.

I am filling out my ADP 401k investment allocation at my new job, and am incredibly confused about what to allocate. I'm aware that when you are younger, you go aggressive knowing over the long haul you win, and when you're much older in life you go very conservative.

i'm 33 years old, and have a lot of catching up to do let's say. My company matches up to 5%.

How should I spread my 5% across these? It says the total has to add up to 100. 
I'd image being more aggressive is the right move for the next 25 years right?

investing,A Brief Discussion of Long Term Returns,"I want to discuss some common misconceptions about risk. I've seen them both in this subreddit and with other investors. Specifically, the relationship between risk and return.

*  **Misconception 1: taking more risk guarantees better returns, particularly with the stock market**. Risk doesn't just mean increased volatility in the short term and higher maximum drawdowns- it also means increased volatility in things like 10 year returns and 20 year returns. Investing from 1990 to 2000 in stocks would return an incredibly different annualized return than 2000 to 2010. This is also true of longer time frames, though to a lesser degree- in the very long term, average stock returns tend to normalize out, but I keep seeing people answer that stocks are the only possible answer in a 10 year time frame and that high returns are guaranteed in a 10 year time frame, and I want to slap those people. You can believe what you want, but don't spread misinformation.
*  **Misconception 2: Future long term stock returns will look exactly like what past long term stock returns were, so you can just assume 8-10%.** Chances are, they are going to be a bit lower (not talking about market timing, just that long term returns likely won't be 8% after inflation). A few reasons- first, long term growth has slowed for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to slower population growth, an increase in inequality, a reduction in productivity growth, ""lowflation"" due to inflation targeting, and an increase in outsourcing; lower inflation expectations reducing the risk premium paid on risky assets (including stocks), lower interest rates (they've been on a long term trend, partly in response to the longer term lower inflation trend), and a one time significant increase in long term average P/E in the 90s. Long term NGDP growth is lower than in the past, and corporate earnings as a % of NGDP should average out to about the same in the long term (because if earnings are higher, there is less money for consumers, reducing earnings eventually).
*  **Misconception 3: Corporate earnings are high, therefore they will remain high.** [Corporate earnings historically are mean reverting.](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc140505b.png) The fact that they are high now does not guarantee that they will be high forever.
*  **Misconception 4: Long term returns increase in direct proportion to the risk you take.** This tends to be true for some risk- if you look at the S&amp;P 500, then compare it to the Russell 2000, the Russell 2000 has higher volatility and maximum drawdowns, but it has slightly higher long term average returns. Similarly, a value focused market cap weighted large cap index has higher volatility than the S&amp;P 500, but it also has slightly higher returns. Investment grade corporate bonds have lower volatility and lower drawdown, but lower return. Government bonds have even lower volatility, and even lower returns. Some notable exceptions: Commodities (including gold) tend to have higher volatility than the S&amp;P 500, but significantly lower returns; Junk bonds have higher volatility, but slightly lower returns (implying that there may not be a clear place for junk bonds in one's portfolio unless they are clearly underpriced); Tech stocks and growth stocks, both of which have higher volatility than the S&amp;P 500 and lower long term returns. These asset classes may sometimes outperform, sometimes for very long times, but historically in the long run they have lower risk-adjusted returns.
*  **Misconception 5: the price you get into the market literally does not matter if your time frame is long enough.** While the price you pay becomes less important to your average annualized returns over time, that just means you are spreading the price difference across different years. Example: let's say you get in at a 25% higher price (after dividends are paid) than a few months later. In 25 years, you would have had 25% more money getting in at the lower price, but your annual % return will only be different by 1%. 25 years after that, your annual % return will only be different by 0.5%, even though you still would have had 25% more money getting in at the lower price than the higher price. Now, **this does NOT mean you should market time, because most people are absolutely terrible at market timing and miss out on years of dividend payments, so often buy and hold and dollar cost averaging in is better than market timing. But dear god, stop saying that price doesn't matter, because it does.**

personalfinance,Fixed or Floating Student Loan Interest? About 10 days to decide.,"Hey Reddit, 
My student loans are about to enter repayment. I was sent the standard 'We're going to start taking money from you, how do you want it done?' letter in the mail and I have some questions about the interest options. 

Basically I have the option between a fixed interest rate and a floating interest rate.   
 
Fixed is Prime+5%  
Floating is Prime+2.5%  
Prime is currently 3%  

As it stands, I owe about 12,400. I have about 5800 that I'm putting towards it immediately, bringing it to 6600, and I'll likely be throwing another 2000 at it in the next few months.   

Without making any additional lump sum payments (which I plan to) my loans would be paid off in about 4 years with monthly payments. That's my 'Worst case, life/income levels stay the same' scenario, so I'm hoping to lower that considerably, ideally I'd like it paid off in the next year.  

As of right now, the floating interest rate seems better, but I understand that it changes, I just want to know what's best on a short term repayment plan.

personalfinance,Should I trade in my car or pay it off?,"So I am trying to decide what to do with my car...

Right now, I have a 2012 VW Jetta TDI that I purchased new in 2012. I have an interest rate of 2.9% over 66 months and have 42 payments remaining (around $10,500 left). 

Last year, the car had a complete fuel system failure which resulted in an entire replacement of the system minus the gas tank. Thankfully, it was under warranty, as it would have cost me over $10,000 to repair. Otherwise, the car has had all of its routine maintenance and regular oil changes.

My question is... do I trade in my car with its previous fuel system failure or do I keep paying it off, and maybe purchase an extended warranty for roughly $2000?

I am not in credit card debt and I do have a secure, well paying job for  at least another 1/2 year. However, I am getting married soon (the wedding is already paid for) and will be moving to where ever my future husband can land a job once he graduates. I do have a teaching certificate, so I could most likely land a job without a ton of hassle. (I think, I hope).


I'm simply worried about taking the car off and away across the country with it having that previous huge issue, especially if I can get a car or equal or better value for the same payments. Is it worth looking in to? Or should I stick with what I have?

personalfinance,"Saving for a house with student loan debt (Yes, I have reviewed the FAQ).","Hey there,

So here is my question.  I have approximately $8,200 in savings which I would like to continue growing it for a down payment on a house.  I also have approximately $12,000 in student loan debt with manageable interest rates (see below).  I understand that paying off my student loans with my savings will reduce the interest I pay on them, and from my calculations using unbury.me it would say approximately $1,600 in total if I were to pay both student loans completely off today.  My question comes in as this:  I would like to by a home, and I would like to buy one sooner rather than later because mortgage rates and housing prices right now make it a great time to buy.  I worry that If I were to pay off my student loans completely now, by the time I was able to save up for another down payment on a house mortgage rates and housing prices will have gone way up.  I live in the midwest, and I would likely buy a house for somewhere between $80,000-100,000.

Here is my current situation:
28 year old single, living alone.

-Fully employed in public service with a monthly net income of at least $2,200.  Generally it is higher due to mandatory overtime or overtime I volunteer for.  This year I will make no less than $50,000 gross.
  
-Retirement: $20,000 from previous employer 401k / $2,500 in current 403(b).  I also take part in the WI retirement system as ""Protected"" status; which I have read is one of the best in the country for public service.  Currently contributing $240/month to 403(b).

-Savings.  Checking account which I use for all expenditures: $1,200.  Emergency Fund: $4,200.  Savings (which I currently have designated for a house): $8,200.  I also have just started saving $50/ paycheck designated for a future car.  

-Vehicle: 2004 Ford Escape w/ 130,000 miles.  Excellent shape and I complete regular maintenance myself.  I need a vehicle, and cannot bike to work/ get rid of my vehicle.  Paid off.

-Rent: $600 / month. 
-Utilities: Electric $50/ month.  Internet: $50 / month.  Landlord pays heat, and I have ""cut the cord.""  Cell phone paid for for the next 1.5 years.

-Student Loan Debt:
Perkins Loan: $4,600 @ 5%.
Stafford Loan: $7,300 @ varied interest (the original loans were as follows: $9,000 @ 6.55%, and $5,520 @ 2.080 %). I am aware of the public service student loan program where your loans are cleared after 10 years, but mine will be paid off before then by making minimum payments.

I've been a long-time lurker but first-time poster!

I start a new job (first job out of university) in a couple of weeks, and need advice on how to utilize this money in the best way.
I'm hoping someone who's more of a finance guru than me can help me sort out how to save the most amount of money per month, while paying off my debts in the least amount of time.


MY INCOME will be $50k/year before any deductions and paid semi-monthly.

MY CURRENT DEBT IS:

1. $422.15 interest-free loan I owe my friend. While he hasn't been pressuring me, I'd like to pay this back ASAP.
2. $15993.56 owing to OSAP/NSLSC (student loan). According to their website, their current interest rate is 5.5% floating, and my daily interest charge is $2.31. The remaining term is 114 months after December 2014 (I will receive Repayment Assistance until December 31, 2014)

I do not carry a balance on my credit cards. And my credit rating is EXCELLENT.
I have negligible savings since I've diverted it to help my family out over the last couple of years.
I live with my parents for now, and so I do not have other monthly expenses (except buying groceries, etc. when I'm able to).

Finally, here's my existing game-plan:

1. Pay back my friend ASAP. This will come in the form of a lump-sum payment from one of my first paychecks.

2. My parents have taken out a line of credit to help me pay off NSLSC. This line of credit is a lower interest rate than the NSLSC charges, and I can make as large a payment as I want, whenever I want.
To that end, I'd like to put in 40% of my take-home towards that debt. At that rate, I think I should be able to pay it off in just over a year (12.26 months according to my math.)

3. 25% into long-term savings (what's best in my case? Mutual Funds? Stocks? How do I diversify?)

4. 10% in discretionary spending (which includes meals out &amp; entertainment + saving for big-item purchases)

5. The remaining 25% I've committed to my recurring monthly expenses &amp; giving (car insurance, etc.)


When OSAP is paid off, I'm considering adding 15% to my savings (bringing that to 40% of my take-home), 10% to my discretionary spending (bringing that to 20%), helping parents with 10%, and 5% into an emergency fund/short-term savings.

dogecoin,"Moolah, Reddit, and the future of the Dogecoin Community","Well, Moolah happened. A big thank you to Jackson, Ben, and all the Moolah staff who have come forward. This can't have been an easy process for any of them. 

I quit my Dogecoin job with a charity because of Moolah. I won't go into all the details here. That's for another time. We had many shady experiences with Moolah, and I quickly learned not to trust them. Suffice it to say that after Ben and Jackson left the community, I was no longer comfortable in my role as Reddit Dogecoin Marketer. I decided I would be much happier working at Taco Del Mar, finishing my classes, doing stand up comedy, and playing music. 

I don't want to talk about that, though. Water under the bridge. We all know what happened. At the risk of furthering the witch hunt, I'd like to talk about the big alien in the room. 

Reddit. 

My first interactions with Ben Doernberg were in the Restore the Fourth subreddit. I'm a privacy guy, and an anti-surveillance guy. You should know that about me, because it's why I'm interested in Dogecoin in the first place. If you disagree with me on those grounds, I welcome your input, but I think my perspective is important for the point I'm going to make. Ben did amazing work with Restore the Fourth, work that was unfortunately undershadowed by beauracratic proceedings and a general lack of interest. The situation was strangely similar to what happened with the Dogecoin Foundation. (this is my distant observer view -- I'm sure Ben has a different and much better perspective.)

I was embroilled in family drama at the same time the drama on the subreddit happened. When I heard that Ben and Jackson had left the community when I was gone, I was devestated. I looked up to both of them as people who took the initiative, people who had broken through the bystander effect in order to make dramatic, positive change. I thought Moolah had bought off the admins, I thought Moolah was paying shills. I've used Reddit for a very long time now, maybe over a decade, so I like to think I have a little bit of understanding of how Reddit works and how marketing on reddit works. 

All of this is my roundabout way of saying that I think we still have a serious problem in our community. According to Alex, Reddit came to him offering a sitewide crypto ad buy for 30,000$. Oddly enough, I believe him. Since Ben posted the Moolah info, his account has been banned from Reddit. There is a serious conflict of interest here. Reddit has a strong motivation to protect the people who are paying 30,000 for ad buys. Moolah is bankrupt, but his influence may remain. 

Does anyone else remember that list of banned words from /r/worldnews? Snowden, NSA, Surveillance, Bitcoin, Dogecoin. That hit me hard. It made me realize that censorship on reddit was a very real issue. While I can understand a mods' perspective, lord knows I can wax obnoxious about any of those topics, it still made something in me shift. When Ben and Jackson left, I was pretty much only visiting reddit for /r/dogecoin. Seriously, I love all y'all. You're amazing. But when I stopped visiting Dogecoin, I stopped visiting Reddit. I haven't found a replacement. 

I was a longtime Digg user before I found reddit, and I watched all the exodi as people became fed up with Digg. There was no straw that broke the camels back, people left in waves. I promise you, Reddit is in the early stages of this process. As they try to monetize, this phenomenon will continue to grow. You've already seen the rise of Whoaverse, but it doesn't really address some of the core issues. Ultimately, what it comes down to is that 

Dogecoin needs somewhere else to organize. We need somewhere where we don't have to plead with admins to get our most valued community members back. We need a place where marketers can market without breaking site rules or controlling the community. We need both increased mod power, and increased mod accountability. We need decreased admin power. We need a site where voting produces Doge. We could have it so much better. 

I recall a while ago, people were working on alternate discussion forums. I support these efforts 100%. If dogecoin is going to succeed as a community, our interests must come before that of the platform we are organizing on. Thanks for reading, and participating.

Bitcoin,Xapo loses two banking relationships in a year.,"From the website The Information. https://www.theinformation.com/Banks-Freeze-Out-Bitcoin

TL;DR: We know banking relationships are difficult for many Bitcoin startups, but I somewhat surprised that even companies with funding on the level of Xapo's are having difficulty keeping banking relationships. They've been kicked to the curb twice in the last year. 

Here's the full article text:


Banks Freeze Out Bitcoin

With $40 million in investments, you’d think the bitcoin company Xapo would have an easy time finding a bank to hold all that money. But twice in the last year, banks have sent Xapo to the curb.

“Here’s a cashiers check for all your cash, thank you for your business,” Xapo CEO Wences Casares recalls a U.S. bank telling the company which helps people buy and store bitcoins.

Big U.S. banks are freezing out the bitcoin industry, making it hard for companies dealing in the cryptocurrency to open accounts to pay their employees, let alone to deposit dollars that they receive in exchange for bitcoins. Banks say there are serious hurdles to working with bitcoin entrepreneurs. At the top of the list: the anonymity of bitcoin transactions makes it hard to comply with money laundering regulations, which carry stiff penalties for violations.

But increasingly, banks are quietly figuring out how to work with bitcoin companies. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo launched a group headed by the bank’s anti-money laundering head Jim Richards, to explore bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technologies. Both Bank of America and Citigroup’s research arms are studying the technology closely.

The efforts by major banks suggest just how seriously major players are taking bitcoin. As hundreds of millions of dollars have poured into bitcoin companies from eager VCs, it may pay off to be one of the few banks currently servicing those clients, like Silicon Valley Bank. But banks also say they’re intrigued by understanding the underlying technology better.

At the same time, the difficulties bitcoin entrepreneurs have in working with banks is a reminder of an ironic problem for bitcoin supporters: to succeed, their decentralized currency may need help from the most skeptical traditional forces, like regulators and banks.

“In 12 to 18 months, I hope and expect that there will be some banks that will be competing for bitcoin business and will be positioning themselves as bitcoin friendly banks,” says Barry Silbert, founder of the Digital Currency Group who meets with bankers regularly. “They’re all digging in and figuring out what their strategy should be.”

Money Laundering

During his yearly presentation to his limited partners, Meyer “Micky” Malka, the founder of Ribbit Capital and an early bitcoin investor, broke down the progress bitcoin had made in the last year: green, marked good news; yellow, okay; red, bad. Bitcoin’s relationship with the banking industry was in red.

That’s largely because banks have an obligation to adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires banks to watch out for money laundering.

Banks are extra wary of non-bank financial institutions.  That is the number two concern on a list of nine types of businesses to watch carefully in a 2010 manual from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, a conglomeration of government entities that monitor banking and money laundering.

Given bitcoin’s anonymity, and its links to murky activities like underground drug marketplace Silk Road, banks are extra cautious. That means that they’re likely to avoid serving bitcoin companies even when the company says an account is supposed to serve only operational functions, like paying employees.

“If you’re looking from a bank's perspective, what’s the upside for us?” says Adam Shapiro, director at the Promontory Financial Group, a major bank consulting firm that has advised banks on bitcoin and other new banking technologies. “The banks that are interested are those that already service [money services businesses] and see a growing and potentially lucrative market, or those that want to understand Bitcoin and blockchain technology better for their own purposes.”

Banks get even more worried when companies want to move beyond a traditional operational account to a “transactional” one, which makes it possible for bitcoin businesses to deposit their customers’ dollars in their account in exchange for services rendered, often selling bitcoins.

With transactional accounts, banks have to find ways to make sure their bitcoin clients aren’t letting their customers send money to someone on the Office of Foreign Asset Control’s blacklist, which includes individuals subject to sanctions for trade or national security reasons.

Banks have made some progress. One approach: bitcoin companies can give banks direct access to their internal data, so that the banks can watch for sketchy behavior. But that still can impose expensive monitoring hassles and risks.

As a result, most banks say they’re looking, but waiting.

“[Bitcoin] is one virtual currency that we’re monitoring in a rapidly evolving space,” a spokesman for Wells Fargo wrote in a statement. “For now, we’re gathering information and learning as much as we can.

Banks aren’t only interested in bitcoin because it could offer a new client base. The underlying technology could help banks cut costs. Transferring money internationally requires banks to pay fees to other banks. Not so with bitcoin, Ripple, Stellar and a range of other cryptocurrencies. That’s why companies like Ripple Labs, which manages an alternative cryptocurrency and is focused on building a new payments infrastructure, have been more successful developing ties to U.S. banks, who have an interest in their focus on the mechanics of sending money around the globe.

Interim Solutions

Right now, most bitcoin businesses depend on Silicon Valley Bank, which offers both operational and transactional accounts. Mr. Silbert says that it would be a major problem for the bitcoin industry if that bank left the market. Silicon Valley Bank did not have a comment for this article.

City National has made early moves to support bitcoin companies. And in many cases, venture capital investors are using their own connections at banks to help their bitcoin portfolio companies get access.

A few small banks have jumped in. The cryptocurrency company, Ripple Labs, signed CBW Bank of Topeka, Kansas and Cross River Bank of Teaneck, NJ. “The smaller banks do move faster,” says Chris Larsen, CEO of the company that’s trying to rethink international money transfers.

Quick has had ongoing problems. CEO Nathan Lands says that two months ago a major U.S. bank closed the company’s account and put a check in the mail. He says a banker even advised him to take his name off his and his wife’s personal account, lest it raise suspicion.

It took him ten days to find a new solution. He won’t say what it was. He says bitcoin companies can either rely on bitcoins for everything and keep cash under a mattress, keep trying commercial banks and hope they don’t get flagged, or open a bank account in another country.

Coinsetter, a bitcoin exchange, says it uses a bank in Malta as its transactional bank account. Using foreign bank accounts means that transaction speeds tend to be slower than they would at a big U.S. bank.

In the end, Promontory’s Mr. Shapiro says he expects more banks to open up to bitcoin—but it’s not clear how soon or how many.",cryptocurrency,1413828695
personalfinance,Public Student Loans and Death question,"Here is an uplifting question to start our Monday....

My wife has sizable student loans from law school ($200k +++ gotta love 5 years of interest). All were public/government loans (US, sallie mae) and were consolidated a few years ago (consolidated through government/sallie mae program). **I am not a cosigner on anything.**

Now that we have a child, I was thinking about or liabilities and what would happen to each of us. My life insurance is $400k term (though I will be increasing it in the next 2-3 years), she has about $150k-ish. Incomes are $65k/$50k (me/her).

From what Ive read, federal loans are discharged at death. But does this mean that they will ignore her 'estate' and not try to recover anything? or do i need to get enough of a policy to cover her loans plus the loss of her income? While I could get by on my income alone, it would be a struggle due to daycare costs and I'm sure i would need quite some time from work to cope.

The loans will disappear in another 5 years thanks to the public service forgiveness program. Hopefully this is a non issue, but I need make sure my family is protected.",finance,1413829154

personalfinance,"X-post from Mortages: Can you help me build a knowledge base about what goes into a mortgage refi? I.e., the math, the particularities behind a basic refi vs. FHA streamline, etc.","Hello! I've started looking at the possibility of refinancing our house. When we originally set up our mortgage, there were portions of the loan process that I just agreed through and portions that I wanted to make sure I understood - like the process of buying points and locking in an interest rate. But we've now been in the house for 4 years and rates look great when I look around. I just want to make sure I have the best understanding I can get about what's involved with actually performing a refinance. 

**Stuff I think I understand**

- The basic purpose of a refinance is to sell the existing loan and buy a new one with a reduced interest rate
- You either bring money to the table in order to pay for the appraisal, fees and closing costs...
- ...or you do an FHA streamline refinance and roll those costs into the price of the new mortgage (**this is going to work best for us, as we simply do not have the spare capital to pay the process of paying off the fees and closing costs associated with the new mortgage**)

**Stuff I do not understand or cannot figure out**

- When the new loan is created, is it based on the principal balance REMAINING on the loan or on the ORIGINAL price of the house?

- Does this negatively impact our credit rating?

- How much does the actual process of refi cost?

I sorta feel like I could answer this question if I could untangle the math in some of these [refi calculators,](http://www.hsh.com/refinance-calculator/) but they seemed geared towards a basic refi, not one involving the FHA streamline. Does anyone know if there's a calculator out there that includes the FHA streamline fees (or calcs them for you?) Or, alternately, can anyone explain those fees to me? I have no problem with building an excel sheet that cranks the numbers. 

My endgame here is that, when my wife and I sit down at the table to deal with...well, whoever we decide to refinance with, we both have stronger understanding of what's going on and why.",finance,1413831422

---

Hi, I am looking for the kind of advice that seems to be very common here. My finances are a little complicated so I will try to give as much info as necessary but please feel free to ask for more. 

I am married but my husband and I tend to keep our finances more separate than most couples. We are more comfortable with things this way and I don't have any complaints about it. Because of that I don't have all the details (exact numbers) about his accounts but I can get it if it's necessary to get advice here.

The broad strokes wrt my husband's finances:

* salaried at $115k
* usually gets 10% annual bonus
* also gets to buy company stock at a discount and sell it twice a year (usually nets $1k to $3k twice a year)
* is starting a small business and putting a lot of his income into that; no profits yet
* 401k with about $50k, company matches so he maxes out his contributions

My finances:

* salaried at $52,000/year takehome about $3500/month
* have a mandatory pension contribution of $310/month, currently about $5000 in pension contribution account
* $45k student loan debt (at 1-2% interest)
* daycare $950/month
* car insurance $50/month

I don't have any other bills I'm personally responsible for. My husband pays the rent (since he makes a little over 2x what I make, we figured it was just easier if I pay daycare and he pays rent -- also bc I have a dependent care FSA plan through my work). Our utilities are bundled into our rent, except cable which his work pays for bc he works from home. Our cars are paid off and I walk to work so we don't spend much on gas.

Food and other household stuff (cleaning supplies, toiletries, diapers) we pay for out of a joint account.

We also have an e-fund of about 6 months expenses liquid that my husband has set aside.

My financial goals:

1. Get a much better retirement account going. I don't 100% understand the pension and I think that unless I stay at this job for &gt;5 years then I don't actually get anything out of it, and I'm not sure I'll be there that long. I think I need to start a separate account, but I don't know what kind. My employer doesn't offer a 401k and our income is too high to get any benefit from a tax-deferred IRA. What kind of retirement account should I have and how many dollars should I be putting in it every month?

2. Pay off student loans. The interest rate is so low that this is actually not a huge priority for me but I guess the sooner it's gone the better.

3. Save up for a downpayment for a house. I think we will need $50,000 to $100,000 to put 10-20% down. We don't have a dedicated house savings fund right now.

4. Save up to be able to buy my next car outright instead of financing it. I have a 9 year old Mazda with 160,000 miles on it. I don't mind driving it until the wheels fall off but I will need another car some point in my life and it would be great to be able to buy it free and clear.

5. Setting aside money for my daughter's college fund so that she doesn't have to live under the burden of student loans that I've had to.

personalfinance,"I'm confused, need help deciding which route to take.","So I received an offer from discover for a zero fee balance transfer at 4.99% APR for 24 months or 0% APR for 18 months with a 3% fee. I was planning on using the 24 month offer. This offer uses your existing balance and does not do a hard pull on your credit.

I'm looking at two options for myself.

Here are my debts:  
  

BBVA: 3,475 [Here is the APR breakdown](http://i.imgur.com/hUVJc5O.png)
  

Capital One: 1,500 @ 11.15% APR

So my original plan was to do a balance transfer of 610 from BBVA to cover the purchase and cash balances. Then transfer 1500 from capital one. I have a $4300 limit on my discover card so that's the max I can transfer

The promo rate of 1.99% for the 2,939 will end March 2015 then convert to a cash interest rate. My plan was then to apply for a 0% APR card for another balance transfer in March.

I had a second thought. I want to avoid applying for a new card in march if i can, it will damage the ""average account age"" on my credit report plus having a new hard inquiry. My FICO according to Discover is 776 and I would like to keep it that way.

So i was thinking of transferring the full BBVA balance and doing a transfer of $600 from the capital one balance then paying off the rest. If i do this i lose 4 months of the promotional rate of 1.99% and i can't transfer the full capital one balance @ 11.15% APR, plus I paid 3% fee which loses value to me if i cut the promotion short.

So in summary should i transfer the full BBVA balance or wait until the promotion is over then apply for a new card (was thinking chase slate) or should i do it now and avoid applying for a new card?",finance,1413837798

personalfinance,Roth IRA contributions the year before getting married,"My fiancee and I are getting married next year.  The future Mrs Bender_Abandons recently found out that her parents opened an investment account in her name about a decade ago, which is now worth about $6,500 (about half of which are gains). They just gave control of the account over to us.  She currently makes $15-20K per year, however, when we are married we will most likely be in the 25% tax bracket.  We expect to retire in that tax bracket or higher.

We are thinking about closing the account and putting $5,500 of those funds into a Roth IRA.  My understanding is that because she will be in the 10% or 15% tax bracket for 2014, she will pay 0% in federal taxes on the capital gains and will owe 5.25% in MA state taxes (see sources below).  Since our combined tax bracket will be 25%, this is the last year she would be eligible for 0% taxes on capital gains.  The only other investment she has is about $3,500 in an SEP-IRA which her employer started contributing to this year (and I understand it does not count against traditional/roth IRA limits).

My thought is that this essentially lets her only pay 5.25% in taxes on the gains and then enjoy tax-free distributions when we retire.  This seems a little too simple.  What am I overlooking?

I recently graduated and just started my career with a position that pays $32,240 a year. It's a little less than what is typical for my field and I'm currently being paid hourly, but I love the job but the last person to have this position was promoted within 6 months to a salaried job with better pay and a 401k, so I’m optimistic.
 
I unexpectedly hit the limit on federal loans last year and had to spend the $8000~ I had saved up to replace my 22 year old car on school. Had to tough a summer driving two hours a day with no air conditioning in Texas. Plainly, it sucked. I don’t have a long commute anymore but I really do not want to spend another summer without A/C and I’m being realistic about how much more my car can take. Ideally, I want to pay around $8000 cash for a small car made between 06 – 09. Once that's taken care of, I want to save up for a small wedding - my partner and I come from families of bitter divorcées with tons of debt so we're not getting any help for a wedding from them.

Currently:


• Take home pay: **$2071.64**

• Currently in the bank: **$6500**

• Debt: **$34,992** in student loan debt from 10 different federal loans, averaging 5.9% interest rate ($386 a month to pay it off in 10 years with $11449 going to interest. Ideally, I would like to get this taken care of faster. I don’t officially start making payments until February.)

• No credit card debt or car loan

• Monthly expenses: **$1200** (including non-essentials)

• Left over:  **$871**


**In addition**, I was willed a piece of land in French Polynesia that’s jointly owned between myself and my half sister, my portion of the land was valued at $220,000 in 2009. She’s interested in selling it, but she willed the cash parts of the estate so she’s preoccupied with traveling the world and all that. Lucky her! This is sort of “out of sight, out of mind” for now, but it should factor into long term planning.

Anyway, I’m not sure how to balance my spending between saving up for a car, paying off loans, and saving for retirement with all of this in mind. 

Since I have about 5 months of expenses saved, I guess I can cross off the “emergency fund” from my savings goals. I know about paying off the highest interest loans first, but should I be making more than the minimum payments or start paying off the loans right now if I’d also like to buy a car in cash sometime in the next year? How much should I put towards retirement in an IRA at this point since I’ll eventually have the option of a 401(k)?

Fixed will be 5.25%, which will still leave me with a lower monthly payment than I currently have.  Obviously we're in a historically low interest rate environment here, so I am concerned that when rates start to rise my payment will reset and go up.  Any thoughts?  Thanks!",finance,1413896874
personalfinance,"My whole life has changed in the last 24 hours, I need advice.","Firstly, this is a throwaway. Secondly, sorry if this has been asked before...I'm beside myself and just want a quick answer. I've been doing reading around and was debating waiting until next moronic Monday if I couldn't find an answer...but let me explain.

I recently graduated college, got a career going, have roughly 35-40K in student loans of varying interest rates principals etc. etc. Lurking PF and posting a question or two has allowed me to develop a good plan for paying my debts off, building my credit etc etc.

So, to the life changing incident.
Someone very close to me has come across a very large amount of money, (legally btw) and I believe there is a very good chance that I'll be able to pay my loans off to some extent either completely or be able to take a large chunk out of it. Like I said, this person is very close to me and I've helped this person out a lot, I don't plan on expecting anything but this person has already alluded to helping me out. 

In the event I can pay them all off at once should I? Or should I put all the money (if I get it) into a separate checking account and set up auto payment and get them paid off in 3-5 years? What would be better for developing credit?

Also, if I do receive a ""gift"" I'll have to pay taxes on it correct?

Also, this person is getting in touch with a PF adviser who we know and trust and will be meeting with soon to discuss options.

I know 35-40 K is a large sum to let someone borrow but like I said, very near and dear, I don't expect anything, I'm just trying to figure out hypotheticals.

Sorry for the vagueness but I just want these couple of questions answered, we are going to the PFA for everything else and I couldn't wait to speak with him as it won't be for a few more hours, also the idea of having no more student loans is absolutely...I can't believe I'm writing this.

I haven't done much traveling in my life and I'm wondering what I should do about money while I am there. 

Hong Kong and Macau have different currencies, and I'm afraid sticking only to cash could get confusing. Should I open a credit card specifically for this trip that doesn't have foreign transaction fees? Is it ok to open a card for a few months and then close it when I'm done, or should I look for a card that I can continue to use long-term? 

Does anyone have good card recommendations? Browsing online, it seems like Chase Sapphire Preferred and Barclaycard Arrival are the top two recommended, but they have annual fees after the first year. I can also get a card through through PenFed, looks like they have a Premium Travel Rewards Amex card and a Platinum Rewards Visa.

Yesterday I wrote up a post (unpublished) that was 1 part throwing in the towel, and 1 part clawing myself across the battlefield with broken legs. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and say fuck that attitude. I'm going to raise funds for Doge4eSports again. The community contribution the first time was roughly 448K, and [I will contribute 500K this time](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2jw2co/f_it_doge4esports_lives_on/clg1wbq) (as I did last time). I don't care that I'm out this DOGE. Assholes and scammers (wolves and weasels?) aren't going to stop me from trying again.

I've asked a few people if they want to sponsor Doge4eSports, I'm waiting to hear back. Their purpose is to help distribute whatever Dogecoin we can raise for the students of HSEL's [Fall Semester](http://www.hsel.org/fallseason) League of Legends eSports Tournament. I'll get a new deposit address up as soon as I can.

Sorry for the language, but I'm fucking angry (and motivated). Below the break is the post I made yesterday. I'm leaving it there for context. But **tl;dr, I called the FBI on Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname) and filed a complaint with the IC3 and Doge4eSports lives on**.

The Doge4eSports funds are now gone due to the Moolah issues.

**Quick History**

* Doge4eSports kicked off [2 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2bqjip/doge4esports_a_dogecoin_initiative_that_combines/)
* My contributon: [500K DOGE](https://www.chain.so/tx/5d3f81cea29de80a2715209054d6fe62db3570041e7f8750938da9b61762c35f)
* A friend's contribution: [500K DOGE](https://www.chain.so/tx/b3a8ffd30952cc51b6d837f8c7e8765943b229fe14a343fc1164a35e79883dfa)
* Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname)'s contributions [[4 MM DOGE](https://www.chain.so/tx/75ed377f2854231c85a5757e0981c4f08b5286639a714cf55c2e21ea73355604) &amp; [5 MM DOGE](https://www.chain.so/tx/1d89ae705bc361dfe579429830b8dd67cf74d769934d898365044b7e15852aed)]
* The remaining contributions are from the communtiy
* Last week, Moolah was going to file for Bankruptcy
* I asked Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname) to forward the Doge4eSports full balance from the old wallet to a newly created wallet, as I figured the bankruptcy stuff would make him too busy
* Then the Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname) really blew up
* On Saturday, October 19th, Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname) sent [10 MM DOGE](https://chain.so/tx/DOGE/82d1cbbf0432c2aa87beeea4dd58bc01c9ae2587ed4340845569752c31f9bfcb) to the new wallet address I provided

**Current-ish Events**

I noticed the message and funds on Sunday morning. With the claims against Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname) heavily stacked against him, I contacted the authorities.

On October 19, 2014 @ 7:04 AM CDT, I called the FBI regarding the Doge4eSports funds potentially being mixed with stolen money. Hilariously, the operator on the phone said something to the effect of, ""Wait, so this is like Bitcoins?"" I answered yes, with some explanation, and then he referred me to the [IC3](http://www.ic3.gov)—a partnership between the [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](http://www.fbi.gov/) and the [National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C)](http://www.nw3c.org/).

On October 19, 2014 @ 7:32 AM CDT, I submitted a complaint through the IC3 website stating that the Doge4eSports funds were potentially mixed with stolen money.

On October 19, 2014 @ 7:32 AM CDT, I received an automated reply from the IC3 stating my complaint was received, and I may (or may not) be contacted by an investigator.

**DOGE Wallets**

**NOTE**: Do not send funds to either of these. These are here to show what was in the old wallet, and what is in the new wallet. If anything gets moved from Wallet 1, then we know Shifty-Saboteur McGee is doing something with it. Wallet 2 is entirely in my control. I just can't touch it till I get clearance from some authority.


**[DNEuWVvrArmgfR7PT9wivgh8b2rG9b84FQ](https://chain.so/address/DNEuWVvrArmgfR7PT9wivgh8b2rG9b84FQ)** is the original Doge4eSports wallet. (should be 10,448,595.28807554 DOGE).

**[DRbRqyCythYyvq5bkT4ZnkcDgGCqK9zgxX](https://chain.so/address/DRbRqyCythYyvq5bkT4ZnkcDgGCqK9zgxX)** is the new Doge4eSports wallet. (should be 10,000,000.00000000 MM DOGE)

**What Now?**

I don't know. I stated before, and I'll state it again, I'm willing to refund anyone the contributions they made from my personal wallet. That's the roughly 448K that wasn't my, my friend, or the contribution from Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname).

Then, I wait for the IC3, FBI, NW3C, or any federal authority to tell me what to do. If they don't respond by December, I'll consider release the 10 MM DOGE to the kids participating in Doge4eSports. But, since the entire thing is so sketchy, I'll have to really think this one over.

I could start a new, new Doge4eSports fund. Plenty of people said they'd contribute to it, but I'm still hesitant because this one just imploded so horrendously. If there was a Dogecoin Foundation that could hold the funds, I'd be willing to go that route. I can hold it, but I... don't want to. I'm just at a loss on who can/should be trusted.

**Doge4eSports Lives On**

Matches will continue. I'll figure out new prizing if no Dogecoin. It will still be sponsored by /r/dogecoin. Moolah as a sponsor is definitely gone.

To all who have been watching: THANK YOU.

**Refunds?**

If you contributed to the campaign, and you want me to refund your amount now, PM me. I don't really know when I should do this, but if I get a bunch of people saying they want a refund, I'll just refund each deposit address that isn't mine, my friend's or Moolah / Alex Green / Ryan (whatshisname).

personalfinance,SBA small business financing: which option would you take?,"A bit of background before I get into the three options: my father has owned and operated his small business for almost 40 years now but he hasn't owned the property.  As part of his lease, he has the right of first refusal if the landlord finds a buyer.  My father has been preparing for this (he wants to exercise his right) and a buyer was found a week ago -- he is now negotiating with banks for an SBA 7a loan and has received a term sheet.  The loan amount is ~$3.4 million and the bank provided three financing options (the term of the loan in each of these is 25 years).  The prime rate is currently 3.25% and has been for a few years now -- this is basically the floor for the rate:

**Option 1:**  Variable Annual Interest Rate of the Prime Rate + 1.00% that resets quarterly (results in a 4.25% annual interest rate)

**Option 2:** Variable Annual Interest Rate of the Prime Rate + 2.25% that resets every 5 years (results in a 5.50% annual interest rate)

**Option 3:** Fixed Annual Interest Rate of 6.50%

Rent is currently ~$28,000 a month and rises with CPI.  Option 1 and Option 2 both currently result in my father saving money by purchasing the land (e.g. the loan payments are less than his rent + management fee).  We assume that interest rates won't change. 

In Option 3, my father is initially paying ~$2,000 more per month until Year 5 when we assume he'll breakeven on the rent vs. buy -- this is due to our assumption that the CPI will increase by 2.0% each year. 

We're 99% sure he is going to purchase the property -- the only remaining question is which financing option is the best for him.  My thought is that Option 3 is the best as I think interest rates can only rise and they will rather quickly in the next few months as the Fed stops purchasing bonds.  It also takes any uncertainty with interest rates out of the equation and allows him to budget more effectively.

I'd still like to get other opinions on the matter as this is a huge family decision and it's always great to get other's perspectives.",finance,1413902030
personalfinance,"[advice] Student loan with aunt cosigner, was secretly borrowed for parents to help pay housing costs. Advice.","I took out a loan with an aunt as a cosigner. I was asked by my parents to do so so they could keep the house we were living in at the time.  It was 3 loans(none that i needed because I had fin-aid and half scholarship).  One of the loans didn't have an updated address for us when we moved so it fell into default. My aunt is flipping because she is trying to get another apartment and when they ran her credit she found this loan.  The other two are up to date.  My question is what advice can can you give to handle this?  

My plan was to save up money and offer the collection agency a large lump sum and a condition to remove default from credit report. My parents are terrible with money. they have a Costco membership but don't use it.  Movie channel packages but hardly watch them, chauffeur to my sisters friends, some of whom live 40 min one way, when we hardly use the car.  My aunt contacted my other aunt about how I am a scumbag and am letting my loans go and ruining her life. My parents don't want me to tell my aunt that the loan was for them to help pay for the house.  My other aunt knows about that secret arrangement as I let it slip years ago when I was first apprehensive about it.  She thinks I should put school on hold(taking night classes for a masters path), get a second job, and pay for my parents loan, ""because thats what families due, they support each other"".  I have my own loans to pay, I was in the hospital recently with a skin infection, have my own bills to pay.  I am looking to cut down on phone bill, i have already asked for over time and weekend hours at work, I have called my fed student loan service to get an application for income based repayment plan. 


What is your opinion?  Do you think it is right that I pay for this loan?  Do you think my plan is good as far as getting it paid? Save up lareg sum of money and try to cut a deal or set up payment plan and pay small payments over long period of time for full balance of loan.

personalfinance,Wondering what to do about 401K benefits at my new job vs. paying off my student loans.,"Hey everyone, I recently accepted a position with a Fortune 500 company. The pay isn't exceptional (about $14.50 hourly) but they're offering me Health/Dental/Life Insurance and 401K benefits. 

I don't have all the exact details yet, but I believe that they are willing to match my 401K contributions with an equal amount of company stock (I'm not sure up to what amount). 

I've got about $47,000 in private student loans (Sallie Mae, now Navient) mostly with interest rates between 7% and 8% but my highest, from freshman year is like 10.10%

I also have $27,000 in Federal loans. 

Altogether, my loan payments, beginning in December will be about $900 a month. 

So I kind of feel like I should opt out of 401K contributions and put that money towards my student loans but on the other hand I'm not sure, opting out of 401k feels a little shortsighted. 

If it helps, I probably won't be in this particular position more than 18 Months or so and then will probably either move to a different role in this company or move to another one. 

Also, for the foreseeable future, my only monthly expense will be my $900 student loan payments. I'm staying with family and have no rent or food expenses.",finance,1413903911

personalfinance,Pay off credit card or student loan interest before it capitalizes?,"I'll try to keep this quick! 

I have a credit card with a balance of $524 dollars. It is still in its introductory period so it charges 0% interest until December 1st. At that time, it will have an interest rate of 22.99%.

I have several student loans, some of which have 6.8% interest rates. The 3 loans with the highest interest rates have accrued interest totaling about $1000. This interest capitalizes on December 1st, when the grace period is up and my first payments are due. 

I have about $700 excess income each month, paid on the 1st of the month. For November, should I pay off that credit card and be done with it so I can contribute more to my loans each following month or should I let the credit card sit for November and pay off the accrued interest on my loans before it capitalizes?

I wouldn't be able to tackle all of the accrued interest, but I could make a big dent in it if I only paid my credit card's minimum payment (or even just $100-200.) I could then pay off the credit card over about two months, but it would be charging me interest. I am really trying to get out from under this credit card as soon as possible but a few months' interest on about $500 bucks doesn't seem as daunting as an additional $1000 dollars accumulating interest at 6.8% since it's on top of all of my other student loans.

personalfinance,How do I become independent from my parents while finishing up college?,"Alright, so I am currently in my fourth year of uni, probably graduating in May 2016 or December 2016 (recent addition of a double major). My parents pay for everything. They say that my tuition will be covered as well as books by them until I graduate. I commute 30 mins (each way) to school 3 days a week this semester. 

My problem is that I feel incredibly left out from an actual college experience. I am never on campus for long spans of time, never in the evenings or at night, I rarely go near campus during the weekends because I, 1) don't know whats going on and don't know how to integrate myself into the community and 2) don't have many friends that live near campus that I could crash with for the night if we went out or generally just chill with.

I want to move out so that I can live closer to campus and have more opportunities to meet people and hang out last minute instead of always planning ahead and needing to leave by a certain time to get home (also equals no drinking). The problem with this is, if I move out I also have to take on all of my bills, and I'm not certain that I would get to take my car - if I did I would have to pay the payments for it, my car insurance, and gas. This makes sense but I don't know how to go from having no responsibility to doing everything on my own.

I take 15 or 16 course hours per semester (going up to prob 18 hrs next semester), work a retail job earning $9 an hour for 10-16 hrs a week (currently looking for a second job or one that will give me more hours), I have a loan from last semester from study abroad that is $7,600 and at an interest rate of 3.6%, and if I would have to buy my car from my parents its current value is at about $13,000. What little savings I did have were mostly used up last semester. 

Where I live and the area around my campus are not pedestrian or public transport friendly so having a car is an absolute necessity. Moving out will hopefully help my quality of life (I seriously need to meet new people and experience more things than what I'm currently used to). How do I do it?

both gold and real estate are the big real asset plays. if interest rates go up, wouldnt that make gold shoot up? i was reading about a real estate correction that happened until 2009 then gold shot up quite a bit. do you thing it was a catalyst for people seeing their real estate drop with this correction in real estate that they jumped into gold?

also, i feel we are due soon for another correction in real estate because professionals have been hinting a bubble in real estate due to overproduction of condo's and interest rate (rise) that people would react to gold more and see a bullish perspective in that physical asset.

i can easily see a play on gold then when gold reaches a peak, real estate would look like a hotter asset for long term growth. the only thing effecting gold right now in a negative way is the USD rise. would the USD decline on interest rate change? i know nothing about how interest rates effect the market but all i know is not to see growth in companies involved in insurable assets",finance,1413926863

Looking at the current interest rates, a refinance looks very enticing right now. 

I've been looking at lenders the last couple of days and a lender has offered me to forgo all the lender fees (after some negotiation) and having to pay a closing cost of $1384.50. Being a Costco member helped.

The rate he is quoting me at is 4%if my credit score is 720 or greater, or 4.125% if my credit score is between 700 and 720. I went to Credit Karma, and my credit score was 760. I understand that this is not accurate, so I'm hoping I pop up in the 720+ range.

After the refinance, my mortgage payment will be about $1000, and $1200 if you include the insurance and taxes I pay monthly. In addition, I wouldn't have to pay PMI anymore!

Bitcoin,The two categories of Bitcoin skepticism (and why I'm not overly impressed by either),"So the other day I was reading through [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2jf2tr/of_those_people_that_understand_bitcoin_but_have/) on ""people that understand Bitcoin but have a negative view on it,"" and it occurred to me that most skepticism of Bitcoin falls into one of two categories: there's skepticism of Bitcoin *the concept* and then there's skepticism of Bitcoin's *implementation*.

**Bitcoin the concept**

What do I mean by Bitcoin the concept? Well, what are Bitcoin's key intended features? It's digital, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and has a fixed supply. If you don't think that's a desirable feature set for money, you're probably not going to be a huge fan of Bitcoin.

And skepticism of Bitcoin the concept can arise as a result of individuals having a problem with any one of those features. If you're a goldbug who thinks that ""real money"" must have ""intrinsic value,"" you probably consider Bitcoin's purely digital nature to be a deal-breaker.

Similarly, if you think that money must be ""backed by"" a state in order to have value, the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized may cause you to dismiss the idea.

If you're someone who thinks the state should be able to monitor and control how you spend your money (to prevent things like ""money laundering,"" ""tax evasion,"" the sale of politically-disfavored intoxicants, and Americans from playing online poker, etc.), you might also dislike the fact that Bitcoin is designed to be censorship-resistant.

And finally, you might be convinced that a fixed-supply currency is simply a terrible idea because you think it will lead to ""hoarding"" and economic stagnation.

**Bitcoin's implementation**

But even if you get past the objections outlined above, and still think that the promise of Bitcoin the concept is a good one, you might have doubts about Bitcoin's ability to actually deliver on that promise.

I won't try to list all of the objections in this category but they include doubts about Bitcoin's scalability (""you can't run the world economy on seven transactions per second!""), worries about mining centralization and/or declining block subsidies rendering the network vulnerable to a crippling 51% attack (""do you really think a system in which two or three pool operators control over half the hashing power is 'decentralized'?""), the possibility that the cryptography on which Bitcoin is based will be broken (""quantum computers, yo!""), the risk that concerted action by world governments will succeed in destroying Bitcoin (""the powers that be will never allow Bitcoin to survive""), the vague certainty that ""something better"" will come along and successfully displace Bitcoin (""Bitcoin is gonna be like, the mySpace of cryptocurrency"") and the belief that Bitcoin won't gain mainstream adoption because it's too difficult for ""non-techies"" to use securely (""do you really expect my grandma to use Bitcoin?"").

**Why it matters**

One thing to note is that the objections to Bitcoin the concept are primarily political or economic in nature, whereas the objections to its implementation are largely technical.  And yet, it seems as though people who are skeptical of Bitcoin the concept tend to also be skeptical of its implementation. Similarly, people who think the concept is great tend to think that the implementation is great (or at least not fatally broken). And that correlation strikes me as a not-terribly-surprising example of cognitive bias. If you love the idea of Bitcoin, you're going to want to believe that it can work. If you hate the idea, you're going to want to believe that it can't. I also think the distinction matters because it seems to me that we should be addressing people's conceptual objections first. If Bitcoin the concept is a bad idea, well then we can probably end the conversation there and I don't have to try to understand what the hell a ""bloom filter"" is. On the other hand, if Bitcoin the concept is a good idea, then for God's sake let's try to figure out a way to make it work and improve its implementation -- as opposed to mindlessly jeering from the sidelines about its current perceived shortcomings.

**My own views**

Personally, I'm not too impressed by the arguments against Bitcoin the concept. Considering Bitcoin's digital nature to be a bug rather than a feature is, I think, symptomatic of a failure to understand the nature and purpose of money. [Money is *always* a ledger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKkfhi8Eaiw), notwithstanding the fact that we've sometimes used physical tokens (such as pieces of shiny yellow metal) to serve as the accounting entries in that ledger. I also view decentralization as an incredibly important feature of good money. I'm firmly of the view that power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and that--in our money-driven world--a monopoly power over the issuance of money comes uncomfortably close to absolute power. I also want my money to be censorship resistant, because well, I don't like censorship, and because I believe that financial privacy and financial freedom are basic human rights. And finally, I think that money should have a fixed supply and that its purchasing power should increase as the economy grows, not stagnate or decline, because I view saving money as the functional equivalent of investing in the overall economy. Money isn't wealth. Instead, it gives you the effective ability to make a *claim* on a certain amount of real wealth. When you don't exercise that claim immediately, the resources that would have gone to satisfying your present consumption remain available to be used by others who *do* choose to spend now -- whether for consumption or investment. You have, in effect, ""loaned"" those resources to society. In an economy that uses sound money, deflation thus represents the market-determined interest rate on this form of low-risk ""loan,"" a loan that can be recalled at any time (by spending the money).

And so, just to make my views crystal clear, not only do I not consider Bitcoin's concept to be fatally flawed, I think it is absolutely brilliant. In my view, Bitcoin (assuming it works) has the potential to be the single best form of money the world has ever seen. For the first time we've got something that combines (and exceeds) the reliable scarcity of gold (the ""store-of-value"" aspect of money) with the transactional efficiency of a purely digital medium (the ""medium-of-exchange"" aspect of money).

What about the technical / implementation criticisms? Well, I feel less capable of evaluating these because of my ... let's just say ""less-than-impressive"" background in computer science generally and open-source projects, cryptography, and distributed systems more specifically. Having said that, I will offer a few general thoughts from my layman's perspective. (Also, I have written in a little more depth about the ""altcoin"" issue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2fch11/would_you_argue_that_bitcoin_has_more_or_less/ck877up), which I suppose is actually more economic than technical.) So, in part because I feel less capable of evaluating technical criticisms, I tend to worry about them more, but I'm still pretty (cautiously) optimistic about Bitcoin's future. Why is that? Well, one observation I have is that, in 2014, it's not really possible to be *completely* skeptical of Bitcoin's implementation. In 2008, you could have read the white paper and said, ""cool idea, but it'll never work."" You can't really say that today because Bitcoin *is* working. It's been almost six years now, and the Bitcoin network is still here, still processing transactions, still reaching consensus without any central authority, and still facilitating the transfer and storage of real economic value. And so, if you want to convince me that Bitcoin is doomed to fail, you have to convince me, not that Bitcoin can't work, but instead that it will *stop* working *AND* that it will stop working *in a way that can't be fixed*. So why aren't I convinced of that? Well, one reason, as suggested above, is simply that Bitcoin is still here. Every day that passes without it dying is another small piece of evidence suggesting that Bitcoin might be more resilient than its detractors think. 

But there's another reason, and it has to do with the fact that Bitcoin just isn't that complicated. It's a distributed public ledger that's independently maintained and verified by every full participant in the network using a common set of rules. Public key cryptography is used to allow users to prove ownership of (and reassign) particular entries in that ledger. And so the basic idea is actually quite simple. The only really tricky part was figuring out how to solve the ""double spend problem"" in a decentralized way. And that problem boils down to figuring out a way for participants in a distributed network to reliably reach consensus about the *order* in which transactions are received. That's it. And so the ""consensus algorithm"" is the tricky piece of Bitcoin, and that means that it's also the piece that's most likely to break. But, and here's the important part, the consensus algorithm can break without breaking the all-important ledger (e.g., even if an attacker gains control of 51% of the network, they can't rewrite the ledger an arbitrary distance into the past), and the consensus algorithm (and the protocol more generally) are not immutable -- if they fail or come under attack the network can adapt to counter the threat. As long as the *ledger* survives, and a solution for achieving consensus going forward can be found within a reasonable period of time, Bitcoin survives.

And finally, I'd just point that even if Bitcoin *does* fail catastrophically such that its ledger can't be preserved, that won't mean the end of cryptocurrency. We'll simply take the lessons that are learned from that failure and get to work building the next Bitcoin. Why? Because we believe that, no matter the challenges, the dream of a money that's honest, efficient, and free is one that's worth pursuing.",cryptocurrency,1413930561

I'm now 26, but when I was 18 I went to get my first checking account. I had a check that was probably for $50 from my first day of work at my then new job. I walked in and met with someone that could help me set up my account.. She asked me normal stuff SS, Address, need one or two forms of ID. Everything seemed normal. She did mention she was only a few days into her position at (bank). I didn't think anything of it. She mentioned that it would take about 5-7 business days for the DEBIT card to arrive at home. Cool. At the end I remember complementing her on her professionalism and walking out happy.

A few days later a card came with my name on it. I knew what the debit card was supposed to look like because a good number of my friends had one from (bank). When I opened it up the card wasn't the same and the paper stated that I had a $500 limit and interest rates. At the time I was confused because we didn't discuss a credit card at all (or on the off chance we did I definitely would have said I wasn't interested). I pretty much just put the card in my closet, where it sat for well over a year until I was ready to use it (i.e. pay off in full every month). I waited a few more days and the debit card came. I have thought about this before, but never asked anyone. Was this legal? Ethical? Do some banks automatically extend you a line of credit with a new free checking account? I'm glad I was responsible about this and the card even helped me build my credit.. But I always wondered if I should have even had the card.",finance,1413941982

Bitcoin,Novauri's comments on the BitLicense,"Hello, this is Will from Novauri.  You almost certainly haven't heard of our company before.  We are not planning on releasing it for use until 2015, and we haven't spent a dime on marketing.  Still, our team feels strongly about the emerging BitLicense regulations in New York, and I wanted to share the letter we sent to the DFS with the community today.

We already shared our views within days of the proposal being released [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2aycxs/hi_this_is_ben_lawsky_at_nydfs_here_are_the/cj001u3), but we've had much more time to craft a formal response.  You'll find an abbreviated version below, and a full copy of our letter on our website [here.](https://novauri.com/bitlicense/)

I know this is a somewhat 'dry' topic, but it's important to the future of bitcoin in the US.  Our thoughts on this topic are below.  Thank you.

**About Novauri**

Novauri is a virtual currency startup based in Denver, Colorado and San Francisco, California.  Novauri will allow bitcoin users to purchase and sell bitcoin using ACH debits and credits from their bank accounts.  The service will be available initially to US consumers in early 2015.


We are different from our competitors in that Novauri will not control the private keys to our customers’ bitcoin addresses.  Not only will Novauri never have access to customers’ private keys, but our systems are designed so we will never see private keys in unencrypted form.  


We intentionally built this feature into our service as a risk protection measure for our customers.  Novauri cannot suffer from the catastrophic failures and massive internal thefts we’ve witnessed at services that pool customer bitcoin and control their private keys because Novauri never has control of our customers’ funds, bitcoin or US Dollars.  We feel strongly that this feature is both safer for our customers and cheaper for us as a service provider.  Our design requires no expensive security layers around pooled wallets, no insurance for massive, pooled wallets that are vulnerable to insider theft, or regulatory responsibility as a fiduciary holding retail customer deposits like a bank.


**Innovation, bitcoin, and concerns about the proposed rules**

We believe bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology is the most significant invention of the century.  Bitcoin allows for unique digital information that can exist safely on the open Internet without the protection of a central authority.  Bitcoin’s unique combination of cryptography and “hashcash”-based proof of work consensus with an integrated economic incentive to participate in the consensus that also creates an automated, and fully predictable monetary policy is something we’ve never dreamed of before 2009. The applications for this technology extend far beyond payment systems, and have the capability to uniquely identify anything digitally; a possibility that becomes exponentially more exciting when it intersects with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of things, drone applications, or holograph-based UI and peer-to-peer communications.

That being said, we believe the proposed BitLicense regulation falls short in three key areas:

* Redundancy with existing regulation, and creates unfair playing field,
* KYC provisions and ineffective cyber security provisions are dangerous for consumers, and
* Failure to create a risk-based system that scales with the risk of the service.

**1) Redundancy with existing regulation, and creates an unfair playing field**

Novauri believes that the BitLicense regulation is written in such a way that it will greatly stunt growth and drive innovation to other States or Countries entirely.  The regulation contains provisions that exclude existing banks from the rules entirely.  

Novauri recommends removing the provisions that exempt banks entirely, and replacing the redundant and overreaching language in these areas with a simple statement: The rules and regulations applying to bitcoin at a Federal level (especially from FinCEN) shall apply to all applicable virtual currency businesses with activities in New York State.  

**2) KYC provisions and ineffective cyber security provisions are dangerous for consumers**

Perhaps the most dangerous aspects of the proposed regulations are the identity verification processes.  We’ve already seen the disasters that the data retention provisions in the Bank Secrecy Act have caused in terms of the ongoing identity theft epidemic.  Every week another bank is hacked, and more and more personal information goes up for sale on the darknet.  We feel that these issues are an unintended consequence of the data retention requirements in the BSA, as well as the decision by certain companies to monetize “big data”.  Novauri feels that these are misguided regulations and business decisions, and is vehemently opposed to corporations storing and selling personal information.  The economic costs of identity theft greatly outweigh any advertising revenue made by these companies, and the cost to taxpayers in reimbursing billions and billions of dollars in stolen tax refunds each year, to say nothing of the stress these unintended consequences cause normal people when they discover their identities have been stolen.  

This issue will be far worse with bitcoin, which features a public ledger.  As soon as personal information is leaked, it can be associated with the blockchain and the entire financial history of individuals will be viewable by anyone.  As written, Novauri feels the proposed KYC provisions in the BitLicense proposal constitute a potential threat to our National security. 

Novauri recommends that the NYDFS delay the requirements around KYC until a more elegant solution evolves that doesn’t risk massive identity theft incidents or violations of personal privacy.    We recommend full synchronization with existing regulation, and revision such that an individual’s right to privacy is balanced against the needs of law enforcement.  This synchronization should also include checks and balances that are non-existent today.

Regarding “cyber security”, Novauri believes that the regulations are ineffective, as technologies are continuously evolving.  Novauri recommends that the NYDFS require businesses that act as fiduciaries for customer deposits and maintain control of private keys to hold deposit insurance for 100% of the value of all fiat and virtual currency deposits.  If the business has faulty security, the insurance company can make that determination and increase their premiums.  In the event that the business’s security is unsafe, the insurance companies will not issue insurance at all.  This is a “future proof” way to ensure cyber security without politicizing the topic or risking that rules and regulations become ineffective and anachronistic with time, as they almost certainly will as written.

**3) Failure to create a risk-based system that scales with the risk of the service**

The proposed regulation doesn’t differentiate between businesses that exchange fiat for bitcoin while taking control of deposits, those that exchange fiat for bitcoin and do not take control of deposits, or even businesses that exchange no currency at all and have no responsibility as a fiduciary. This will effectively kill all small businesses and startups in the State of New York, and if these rules are used as a model in other States, will drive the industry offshore entirely.

Novauri recommends creating at least two types of businesses under the proposed BitLicense regulation:

* Virtual Currency Retail or Investment Banking Provider
* Virtual Currency Retail or Exchange Service Provider

Virtual Currency Retail or Investment Banking Providers would be regulated in a manner similar to banks, but Virtual Currency Retail or Exchange Service Providers would be subject to minimal regulation.   Again, Novauri highly recommends using insurance as a way to “future proof” the areas of cyber security and KYC provisions.

In closing, given the possibilities presented by this emerging technology, Novauri requests that the NYDFS consider revising the rules heavily, adopting a progressive and risk-based approach that uses insurance in lieu of prescriptive measures, removes duplicative rules and regulations, and gives the technology the room it needs to grow and evolve.

personalfinance,Family's only car repossessed- What are our options?,"Sorry if this is not the proper sub for this question, but I have been a long time reader and have learned a lot from everyone here, so I do value this community's knowledge and opinion. 

My family consists of myself, my husband and our two children (2yrs and 9mos). 

My husband was out of work from June 1 until last week due to an injury (tore medial meniscus and had surgery) and I am a stay at home parent. Our works comp. checks paid out less than half of his paycheck, we were getting about $200 a week while he was out. 

We fell behind on most of our bills and rent and used up anything we had saved. We were behind on our car payments, which are nearly $400/month, and although were paying what we could it was still too far behind to guarantee that they would not repossess. 

Well, they came and took the car two nights ago. We have our loan through Capital One and they offered to extend our loan so that way we could have to pay much less to get our car back, we would have to pay $1811 plus the towing company's fees, etc. OR we could apply for Loan Solutions, which is offered through Capital One, and they are supposed to renegotiate our loan so that our payments are more affordable and if we qualify, we would have to pay $884 plus towing fees to get our car back. 

I have never heard of this Loan Solutions option before, I have called Capital One countless times to see if there was any way they could help with our situation or help to lower our payments. We have had problems with the high payment before. To be honest, we have been in a dire financial situation for a while. We have saved and then savings went towards our car breaking down, our daughter getting sick and requiring hospitalization after her birth, my husband is working towards his degree so books and tuition, and just unforeseen life events. We are on any financial assistance we can get from the state. We have no family or anyone to ask for help. We also have lousy credit, due to our own fault and my mother using my name and info behind my back. 

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on the situation. We need our car. We have already sold anything and everything that is of any worth. I am young, only 27, I have no idea about where to look for help or any kind of assistance. No one to ask for advice. 

Should I see if we could apply for a loan? What institution is best to go through? Will our credit history just leave us SOL? If we loose this car, I doubt we would be able to finance another one, plus we literally only have $220 in our bank account. We live pay check to pay check at the moment and I just paid the termination notice on our gas and electric.  Ive been sitting here with my kids since yesterday waiting for the kooky ""lets raise some money"" montage to begin but Im totally blank. I have no idea. I can't magically make this money appear and Im afraid our car is just gone and we are…in bad shape. 

Any ideas or opinions would be really appreciated. I just don't know if we are just helpless to the situation or if we might have something that we could try to maybe get our car back and to help our family. 

Thanks for reading!

EDIT: MORE INFO AND ANSWERS TO SOME QUESTIONS

I do not work, I stay at home with our children. We have no one, no family, no one to watch them or to pay to watch them etc. I am trying to some work from home.

We also do not have any family to ask for money, our parents are….not able to help. We are on EBT (food stamps) and HEAP (which was already all used up), we do not qualify for any other assistance. I have tried to apply for everything but normally my husbands salary is too high. Last I applied was January for assistance but it was a no go. We all have state insurance too. I had WIC. Our EBT is enough to make it through for all 4 of us, especially now since the little one is eating everything in her sight. 

He works full time and goes to school full time. He can bus to school and work and get rides. We are fortunate enough to live not too far from a grocery store. There have been times when honestly, I don't know how we survived. It's just us, just the four of us. His coworkers adore my husband and they have helped us tremendously by dropping off diapers, groceries, money, donating their vacation pay to him, etc. We also have a very good family friend who has helped us so much and paid our rent for us and has been just, well just wonderful. That is how we survived the past few months. 

We have never made it out ahead, always just getting by. We were ahead for a while but our car, which is the most reliable thing ever, finally needed some work done. Its a 2009 Jeep Compass and has never had any issues until this past February when it needed over $1500 of work. The was most of our savings that we had started. Before then our savings were non existent because we only had money for rent and bills and gas. We were trying and did manage to save as much as we could.  

As for our loan on the car, we were screwed. We had just gotten married and sold our car to afford a move to another state. We were short the money for our new homes rent and literally the day before we moved- we sold the car, got enough money and went. We moved because my husband got an amazing job there and we were both working with the company and doing amazing. Really really well. But when we got down there, we had no car and no way to get to work, so we rode our bikes around and went to a dealership and they told us the only car they could finance us on was this 2009 Jeep Compass. The dealer told us to lie on our application about our schooling, our jobs, etc. and this is what we got. We had no idea what we were doing, no one to ask advice from and were desperate for a car. There was no way we could have gotten to work. So we did it. 

We still over $9176.43 on the car. 
Here are the terms of our loan:
Original Amount: $15,135.28
Interest Rate:20.580% APR
Loan Term:74 Month
Monthly Payment: $367.64
Open Date:Sep 10, 2010
Maturity Date:Nov 10, 2016

Total Interest Paid: $9,882.03
Total Principal Paid: $5,958.85

After two years of our amazing jobs and doing really well financially and working for a great company, I got pregnant, we had our first daughter, we were far from home, had no friend or family there and decided to move back to be with our family and to have that support and help. The move back cost a lot and so began our downward spiral. Also, babies are expensive (duh) and again, we only had ourselves to take care of everything. We bought everything we needed, we paid for the doctors, etc. Our families helped whatever way they could at the time, but they don't have much to begin with, although their help was tremendous at the time. Anyway, we moved back and my husband wasn't able to transfer with the company like they had promised us. They told us this right before we left too, that he was now only able to work part-time (from being a department manager), we lost our benefits, we lost our salary obviously, he wasn't guaranteed work and to top it off, they left him waiting for any contact of his transfer for 3 weeks! I lost my hours too and was barely working. After giving up on them, we were using all we had saved since there was no income coming in, finally my husband was hired with another company after applying everywhere (too qualified, young, etc) and now is with that same company today. I was working up until I was pregnant with our second daughter and my husband made much more than me, so we thought it made sense for him to work more than me working less and making less. We struggled, badly, for that whole year. The family that we moved back to be with also fell apart quickly. It was a horrible disgusting mess and we are now estranged from certain people and others, well, I have nothing nice to say. So like I said, its just us. Just me and my husband trying to figure this out so our children and family don't have to suffer like this, so we can give our children a better future, which is why my husband is also in school ( 1 1/2 years left till his bachelors, straight A student, deans list, VP of his majors club, etc.). Sorry to ramble but thats our story of our financial situation.

Our monthly expenses are:
$820 rent 
$367.64 car payment
$40 internet
$37 the one flip phone cell that we share
$130 roughly for gas/electric
$10 netflix
$35 for taxes we owe through a payment arrangement 

My husband makes roughly $2000/month

We have a lot of debt that we have accumulated this past couple of years since moving back.

So without going into much detail, I've recently been evicted from my apartment and have no place to go. I just got a new job which was my savior and was supposed to pay for a security deposit for a place to live in a few weeks however I just got told today that they had to let me go because I didn't have a car and they didn't want any risks of tardiness with transportation issues (despite taking a 3 hour bus commute both ways I would still risk being anywhere from 15-30 minutes late). Anyway, I realize my only hope at this point is to get a small personal loan to get a security deposit to get a place to live. My credit score is 606 according to credit karma (not that reliable I know, but it's the best I got for now). which is obviously very poor. I've researched and learned that I could possibly dispute items on my credit report and my credit score might increase, but briefly of course. I know nothing about PF and certainly don't know much about credit reports so my question to the experts is how does the process of disputing work and how possible would it be for me to get a small personal loan of about $2500 after disputing things on my credit report? I know if disputing worked, my score would only increase for a small amount of time but I figured in that small amount of time I'd be able to apply and get approved for a loan. Apologies in advance if I sound naive, but I just need some money to help me get on my feet.

personalfinance,Inherited house and mortgage. Should I 'refinance' to put the mortgage in my name?,"I recently inherited a house and mortgage. The LTV is about 52% (thanks to recent increases in property value).

The existing loan (in my mother's name) is 3.62% and about 8 years into a 30 year fixed. The deed has been put into my name (through probate). I am able to claim the interest paid to the existing mortgage as a tax deduction.

I have never had a mortgage, though would qualify for this one...likely at a higher rate. I have no trouble covering the expenses of this house (mortgage, taxes, maintenance, etc).

My intent is to utilize this house as a primary residence for the foreseeable future. I am protected by federal law in so that if I continue to occupy the house and make payments I am not required to refi the house.

I have contacted the servicer and inquired about assuming the loan. They promised to look into it. They also said they will never accelerate the loan, so long as I continue to pay...even if I did not occupy the house and used it as a rental

I would also like to purchase a second house sometime within the next 5 years. I am open to using the second house as a primary if need be.

Should I refinance into my name, or leave it as it sits?

Benefits to refi:

	Potential positive hit to credit


Disadvantage to refi:

	Higher debt to income ratio
        One time closing costs
	Could in theory walk away from the house with no consequences

That is, I work under my boss. He owns the company I spend all of my time at, but he is also a professor and I work at the University as his TA. In March of this year, I was offered a better title and a pay bump at the university in addition to my TA job. 

Every year before this, I received my usual salary, plus $3k a semester for the TA job (so $6k for the year), which, as a result of my own ignorance cost me a few hundred bucks two years in a row.

In March, things got much more complicated and I'm worried about having to pay a ton of money come tax season. I'll try to break it down as simply as I can. 

I attempted the IRS calculator but I'm not sure how to fill in anything considering the convoluted nature of my employment.

SO, for this year, I have:

- JOB1: This pays most of my salary, which was $40k until my review in June, at which point it got bumped to $44k
- TA: This position paid me $3k/semester, but $1,500 was paid out as part of a ""temporary employment"" agreement, AKA the better title and pay bump for spring semester, and was entirely rolled into my contract for fall semester.
- JOB2: from March 17 - June 30 I had a temporary contract for $20k, which I split down the middle with JOB1 to receive $10k by means of docking my pay for the duration of the contract (worked out with my CFO) + the remaining $1,500. From Sept 1 - Dec 31, I will receive another $10k as part of the second temporary contract.

All of these positions are taxed and on the books with a W2. JOB2 is one weekly paycheck through a temp agency although I am considered an employee of the University with two distinct roles. I file single 1 on Federal and State taxes. JOB1 pays me every other week and I also file single 1 on both Federal and State taxes. 

When all is said and done, I estimate that I will make about $68k gross this year (~$32k from JOB1, $6k from TA and $30k from JOB2). How the helllllll can I figure out if I'm paying out the right amount? HELP!",finance,1414003830

Nonetheless, a mortgage is a big long-term commitment. I've been a member of our local co-op bank for about 8 years now; is it worth asking them for a second quote just to compare options?

personalfinance,Auto Financing Advice Needed - Active Ch 13 Bankruptcy - Motion to Incur Additional Debt,"My husband was injured at work in April 2013. He was out of work with Worker's Comp for exactly one year. During that time, we started to drown in the debt we had. We had, before the injury, reduced the debt considerably, but the amount we still owed piled up with the small amount Worker's Comp paid us. In December 2013, we filed for Ch 13 bankruptcy. Prior to filing, we had 2 vehicles. We surrendered one vehicle, kept and included the other one with a reduced payment through the ch 13 plan. We did not want to file, so we are taking this opportunity to build our credit back and make most, if not all, purchases with cash. If the need for a vehicle wasn't so pressing, I would not consider financing at all.

 In January, I'll begin an intense school/class/clinical schedule commuting over 1 hour away. It will be necessary to have two vehicles. We intend on going through our Lawyer/Trustee to file a motion to incur additional debt. Our financial situation is much better now, but we aren't able to save the cash before January. We have in savings $1,500 to apply as a down payment. (possibly more) I've worked through the numbers to know what we can afford and be able to pay off in 1 - 2 years. I understand I'll need to obtain pre-approval on a loan for the Trustee to file with the motion. So, my main question - what is the best approach? 

 Likely, if I can find a lender to approve a loan, the interest rates will be very high. I don't need anything fancy, new, or extremely nice. Fuel efficient and affordable. 

A list of questions:

1. Are credit unions more flexible with bankruptcy cases than a ""big box"" bank (i.e. Bank of America)?

2. Should we save more for a down payment to increase our chances of loan approval? (Currently $1500)

3. Would I do better to go bank by bank seeking loan approval, or begin with an auto dealer and let them do the leg work?

4. Will this harm my credit further due to multiple credit inquiries? 

5. Should we consider a personal loan vs. an auto loan instead? (I realize the interest would be higher, but the amount would be under $10k, so a personal loan may be more ""giving?"")",finance,1414035987

personalfinance,[TX] Advise on buying car with low credit,"Hello folks,

I respect this group and would greatly appreciate some advise on how I should proceed with a situation.

My credit is bad ( 517 Transunion, 607 Vantage ).  I owe 14,792 in student loans, 2,549 Conns.  I took a new job 90 days ago at a salary of 119k and am able to put 3k a month aside.  Since my first paycheck I have paid off 6k in debt and now owe nothing to creditors beyond student loans that I am paying for.  I expect everything to fall off completely or show paid off within the next 30 days.  I have no credit cards but am exploring the option of getting one once my credit breaks 600.

The current plan has been to establish credit with Conns ( 0% 1 Year ) and make consistent payments to boost my credit until Jan 2015 when it will hopefully break ( 600 Trans 650 Vantage ) and I can put 9k down on a new car.  I will then give my aging car to my father who's car has known issues and is sliding into expensive repairs quickly.

My dads car took a dive last night and needs just under 3000 in repairs with a KBB of under 1500.  Not worth it obviously.

The ultimate goal is to buy a house in 3 years.

So my question is this.  Is it smarter to buy a beater at 3k and push the loan back to Feb or March?  How likely is it that I can get a loan putting 3k down with 119k a year salary on a job that is 90 days old?  I do not want to have my credit pulled if getting a loan is not possible or if the expected interest rates will be over 9%.

Bitcoin,Critique my idea for operating a Bitcoin ATM outside of FINCEN regs,"Newb here. I know very little about BTMs, FINCEN or any of the state laws regarding BTMs so I'm hoping to get some feedback on any points of contention that I might have overlooked. I apologize for the windy post. 

I own some cash dispensing ATMs in Sacramento and recently started researching ways to incorporate a few BTMs into my inventory. Naturally, the KYC/AML regulations put the slam on any such plans. 

Localbitcoins.com designed a BTM ([here](https://localbitcoins.com/atm/order-your-own-bitcoin-atm)) that got me thinking about ways to get around those laws. Their machine works like most others in that the owner of the machine has to provide either cash or bitcoins for their clients to purchase or sell on the localbitcoins website. If I understand the FINCEN laws, (if anyone can understand them,) that would qualify them as a Money Business or Transmitter. Localbitcoins makes 1% on each transaction, but they're based in Finland so they're not subject to the federal regs here in the US. It's important to understand how their machine and website work together in order to understand my hypothetical below. 

I contacted localbitcoins about their machine but they've put the BTM project on hold temporarily. I asked if there was a way an operator could own the machine, but not actually buy or sell any bitcoins with it; they would just use it as a trading post of sorts and let the buyers and sellers interact with each other. They thought it was likely that a system of that design might be created at some point, but not in the near future. They just wanted to know how many units I would buy...which would be zero, because their machine looks like a 1980's payphone.

That was the extent of my suggestion to them, but let me elaborate a bit more here. Ordinarily BTM owners would make their money on the spread between the buy and sell price, or charge a percentage of the transaction amount. If they make any money on the transaction then they qualify as a business and they're subjected to the FINCEN regs. If BTM owners could make their money through a different process though, then they might avoid the FINCEN laws. 

Here's my idea. It's similar to the unbanked btm concept article that the Lamassu machine was featured in [here](http://bitcoinism.liberty.me/2014/07/29/how-and-why-to-build-an-unbanked-bitcoin-atm/), but a little different. Someone would create a machine with a bill recycler and program it to only operate as a storage locker for cash and bitcoins, and the only way people could utilize it was thru the localbitcoins website, just like they've designed for their own BTM. The difference here would be that none of the coins or cash belonged to the BTM operator; the inventory would be supplied entirely by the local buyers and sellers. That way the machine and its owner does not transmit any money, and no commissions are collected at the machine because the amount of cash/btc coming in would be equal to the amount going out.  It stands to reason that would disqualify the operator as a MSB/T. And just like the Localbitcoins prototype, it wouldn't have to be connected to the internet; it would just have to recognize and validate codes that could have only come from localbitcoins.com, and generate codes recognized by LBC online. 

Localbitcoins would collect their 1% for facilitating the transaction and they would keep track of how much money/btc were in each machine, so as to only allow trades that the inventory of the BTM could accomodate. An additional 1%-5% (or whatever % the operator chose) would be charged on the website for using the BTM to redeem the btc codes or depositing the cash. Localbitcoins would then send this commission to the BTM owner for ""services rendered,"" as if it were ordinary income out of Finland. The Money Business would be in Finland, and the Transmitters would be the local users, who are free to follow the FINCEN regs as they see fit. 

I emailed Lamassu with this idea but haven't heard back yet. I'm sure someone else could modify some existing hardware and collaborate with localbitcoins to make it happen in the near future, if it indeed skirted the FINCEN regs. What do you guys think?",cryptocurrency,1414052759

I NEVER visit any other sites other than blockchain.info/wallet/(my wallet) 

Last night I transferred some bitcoins to it. This morning at about 5:00AM every single bitcoin was transferred to the following address:

13Z8pisGbS4QonggxMPdkPrxrtBEnNxoSg

If you look, this thief has over 69 BTC. How could have have stolen them from me? 

Is it possible that there is a vulnerability being exploited on blockchain? Or in TAILS? 

How can I prevent this in the future? I thought using it over TAILS and insuring that I don't click any possible phishing links would suffice.

Hi everyone,

First off, thank-you very much for the comments helping to figure out the likely method in which the BTC was stolen. Furthermore, thank-you again to those who suggested means of mitigating the risk of theft in the future. And to the other comments... Holy crap I didn't think losing BTC to a thief merited such hate!

As an update, here is some clarification on the circumstances surrounding my case.

* **1) No, 2FA was not setup on the account.**  Although this *could* have prevented this particular threat, this does nothing for determining the specifics of how the BTC were stolen
* **2) There was absolutely no email or any other information linked to the blockchain account.**  I did not want to introduce any weakness points which could be exploited (obviously to no avail) 
* **3) A live USB running and up-to-date TAILS was the ONLY tool used to access the blockchain account. Additionally, this live USB was absolutely never used to access anything other than blockchain.info (and, yes, I made sure I was visiting the correct address each time)** My reasoning for this was as follows: I used TAILS because my understanding of it was that it was one of the most secure operating systems out there. I did not visit any sites whatsoever other than blockchain.info because I did not want any vulnerabilities in the browser/OS to be exploited. And as I mentioned, I made absolute sure that each time I visited the site, I typed in the correct address with no errors
* **4) I did not purposely choose to connect to the blockchain over TOR. TAILS automatically connects over TOR and I didn't think that this would be an issue.** And as it turns out, this was likely a critical component leading to the theft. 
* **5) No, I did not make sure to connect to https://** This was largely due to my lack of knowledge of computer security. 
* **6) I used a complex password consisting of about 15 random characters including numbers, capital, and miniscule letters**

As was mentioned in the comments, the likely method of attack was either from having my account credentials ""sniffed"" at the exit node, or being presented with a phishing site which appeared to be the correct site/address by someone controlling the exit node. 

Please let me know if there are any other details 

Also, I am trying to write up a process which could be used to mitigate the risk of theft in the future. I will post as an update here. If anyone is interested, please visit this page again soon. Of course, being that I am not educated in computer security, don't rely on my methods to keep you safe. I am mostly posting it here so that it can be further criticized.",cryptocurrency,1414067595
finance,Noob question: Are interest rate swaps effective at all?,"It's occurred to me that in an IRS, both sides are still subject to interest rate risk, even if one side wants to hedge out the possibility of being exposed to a floating interest rate.

For example let's say you're investor A and you want to swap out your floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate.  Instead of paying floating you'd rather pay fixed.  so you swap with investor B so they pay you float while you pay fixed.

Great.  But now when rates fall, you're still going to have to pay the difference between the floating rate and fixed rate.  So technically you're still exposed to floating rate fluctuations, just you are now long the floating rate instead of short. 

Am I understanding everything correctly here?",finance,1414069129

personalfinance,Mortgage overpayments confusion. Advice?,"Hi PF, i'd like to know if there is anyone here knowledgeable enough to answer this question about mortgage overpayments. My knowledge on the subject is quite limited and, predictably, my mortgage provider is making it difficult to figure out the best course of action.

Some information about my mortgage:

Amount:		£83,000
Type: 			Repayment
Term:			20 Years
Interest Rate:		3.45% for 5 years, then 3.9%/whatever deal is available at that point
Monthly re-payment:	£479

I recently found out that I am able to make overpayments of 10% of the remaining value of my mortgage each year. Great, I thought, I’ll clear the debt faster and save bucketloads of interest. I’d punched some numbers into a calculator and it suggested that I would be able to save approximately £18k and around 9 years off the term of my mortgage.

When I came to make the overpayments, I noticed that my monthly payment (as above) had now gone down. I presume this is because the bank is recalculating the amount I would need to pay every month over the remaining term of the mortgage in order to clear the debt. This however raises questions and where you may be able to help:

1)	Has making these overpayments benefited me, or has the bank simply readjusted the proportion of principal/interest in my monthly payment, in order to keep the total interest for the term of the mortgage the same?

2)	Is this method beneficial when compared with requesting the bank reduce the term of the mortgage following an overpayment, or is there little difference between the two?

3)	After my initial 5 year fixed period is up, is it normal for the term to be recalculated based on remaining debt? I’m envisaging a point in the future where I have overpaid 10% of the remaining debt every year and now have ludicrously low payments for 5 or 6 years.

personalfinance,Buying a house - should we sell our car at a loss or ride it out?,"Hi Personal Finance - my partner and I need some help.

We recently made a decision to build a house due to running into a bit of money for a deposit, a government grant that gives us $30,000 and eligibility for a home loan that saves us paying interest on $57,000. Building a house as opposed to buying in Australia also saves us money on Stamp Duty (taxes) as we only pay it on the land we have purchased.

My partner purchased a new car a year ago, a 2013 Suzuki Grand Vitara. We no longer have a second car. He financed the full amount, including the leftover debt from his previous car leaving us with a loan balance of $31,000 over 7 years at 6.6% (yes, interest rates are crazy in Australia). We've payed this down to approximately $26,000 currently but the Redbook value is around the $18,000 mark. Yes, he now knows that buying a brand new car was a bad idea.

But now we want to right the wrong. When our house is built costs for the car per month will be as follows:

Repayments: $500  
Fuel: $440 (approx - we're moving a little further out of town than we are now).  
Insurance: $110  
Maintenance: $40  
Registration: $58  
**Total: $1148**  

We would also obviously be aiming to put any extra money directly into paying off the loan. Our options are to keep the car and eventually pay it off, or look at selling it at a loss, getting over it, and purchasing a new cheap (to purchase and run) car for approximately $1500. I've estimated these regular monthly costs as follows:

Fuel: $200  
Registration: $46  
Insurance: $20  
Maintenance: $100 (to allow for it being an older car in case things go wrong).  
**Total: $386**  

As an added complication, I'll be leaving for ten months at the end of next year for an exchange, at which point my partner will probably be bussing to work to save on parking costs - so the car will sit unused for part of the time.

Take home = AIG - Federal Income - State Income - SS - Medicare - MA Tax

This leaves approximately $1600 left over for payment towards school loans. I would pay the minimum on each and use the rest towards paying off via the avalanche method.

personalfinance,I [20M] am a college student seeking advice,"I have been working during the past 6 summers, last fall for a month, and started a new job for the school year in August.  Of the three employers, only my summer job has provided me with a retirement contribution.

A common theme in here, and with any financial discussion, is to start saving for retirement ASAP.  So, I want to contribute to a retirement account while I'm earning my degree.

I earn about $900/month.  I ride my bike to work (and, like most colleges/universities I'm familiar with I get free public transit in my area), eat in the Dining Commons (meal plan that allows me about 6 entries/week) and then buy very minimal groceries (milk, juice, cereal, bread, etc.) and I don't drink or use drugs so no expense there.

I do have loans, which I put $50 or $100 towards each month because they are all Federal but half are unsub' (those are the loans I work towards paying off while the sub' loans I'm waiting to pay towards).

What do you, my fellow /r/personalfinance community members, think is my best option: pay off the loans with the money I'm looking to put into a retirement account, continue with my current loan repayment plan and open a new retirement account, or something else?

P.S. I don't think I can contribute to my retirement account that is through my summer employer (it's a 405(c) or something not a 401(k) or IRA) but I am going to research that.",finance,1414127157

personalfinance,"[Budget Evaluation] some debt, some savings, wondering if I'm missing something","I've seen it mentioned a few times that you guys are willing to take a look at a budget and give suggestions, and since I have a few minutes, I figure I could post my finances and see if anything jumps out.

I currently take home $4,200 per month.

##Current state of my finances

Source | Amount
---------|----------:
Savings | $800
Loan (11% APR)* | $3,992
Credit card debt**/$2,500 max | $2,122
Car loan (3.9% APR) | $11,232
401k*** | +$3,000
Company options and stock (only ~5% vested) | ~$30,000

\* I took out a $7k loan with something like 26%, paid off about half of it before moving it over to another account at 11% when I switched to a credit union.  The lady helping me transfer everything when I first joined heard me talk about this loan was very helpful but I could tell she wanted to beat me with a rolled up newspaper on the nose.  Fair enough, it was a *terrible* decision.  I did get to see Europe, though, so it wasn't all bad.

** I've lately been trying to use my credit card as my primary means of payment for bills and daily expenses, but since I get no rewards on the card, I've lately been second guessing this decision. **Question**: Should I continue to use my credit card as an ""everyday expense"" card if I don't get any rewards?

*** Not sure what it's at currently (it's above $3k though), I'm matching @ 4% right now until end of year when matching goes away.

**Question**: How does a person handle taking another job if they've got unvested stock in their current job?  I assume the person just loses the stock, yes?  How big of a factor should that play into deciding to take a new job?

##Bills!

Rent | $1,300
Car loan | $340

Car Insurance | $110

Food (avg) | $500
Gas | $200

**TOTAL** | **$1400**

##Grand total: ~$4,600.  Yikes.

Also worth noting is my girlfriend and I have *just* bought tickets for a 10 day cruise (and plane to/from) in the Mediterranean in mid/late December.  I anticipate needing to fully drain my savings (plus anticipated savings up to the cruise date) to pay for the remainder of expenses for this trip.  I anticipate $0 savings on Jan 1, with the total cost coming in at around $5,000. 

The trip is a terrible financial decision, I realize that.  Am I fucked, though?  I don't feel fucked, but I could be wrong.

Also my car probably needs a new set of tires soon, and I've been putting that off to pay for things.

In general, I am playing my financial situation very fast and loose.  **Question**: What's my risk?  Are we looking at a precipitous drop into oblivion should anything go wrong, or does anyone here think I've got options if something goes awry (lost job, medical expenses, my tires fall off)?

**tl;dr**:

**Question**: Should I be using my credit card as an, ""everyday purchase + bills"" thing, or is that pointless if I don't get any benefits for doing so?

**Question**: What happens to my unvested stock if I leave my company, and how should that factor into my decision to accept jobs elsewhere?

**Question**: Clearly I'm running at a deficit and have low savings.  This is bad.  Is this entirely because I'm spending ~5k on a cruise, or are there other reasons?  What should I be doing when I get back from my cruise?

**Question**: What is my current risk, and what are some short/medium/long term things I can do to mitigate my current risk?

My credit score isn't too bad right and don't want to screw it up (it's 699 right now).

Over the past three years I've been paying down my private loans pretty aggressively (86k to 64k so far, very high interest) and been paying the minimum on my fed loans (20k to 16k).  In addition, my parents have asked me to take over a parent plus loan they took out for me because they have their own ridiculous money problems, that is $164. I've gone from making 56k to 72k (3500 a month). My expenses however, have been creeping up higher and higher. Admittedly, I try to strike a fine balance between doing what I want to do (be young and fun blah blah..) and trying to be responsible with my money, but lately it hasn't been quite balanced. Over the past year or so my spending got a little out of control, I was used to buying whatever I wanted whenever I felt like it.

I got tired of seeing less and less money in my checking so I started a mint account. It has been depressing to say the least. I spend $1450 a month in student loans, 600 on rent, 360 on car and insurance, over 100 in health expenses, then more money on phone bill, food, gas, shopping(i know...) and utilities and such. I also have a pretty expensive hobby, at 100 a month. It keeps me healthy, busy, and happy though, so I am reluctant to give it up for the savings. Coming to the realization after my first month on mint that I have barely $200 left over at the end of the month has been quite depressing for me. I'm not putting money into savings because I have $5000 for emergencies and crazy good job security, I match my 6% employer 401k contribution (30k).

personalfinance,Best method to build credit?,"I am trying to help my fiancée build credit, and I was wondering what might be the best way to do this. We were looking into three different options.

1. She gets a secured credit card. This would be through our credit union, so it would be easy to deal with since it's where we have our checking/savings accounts. There are no annual fees on the card we're looking at.

2. I have a car loan through the credit union that costs around $90/mo. She drives the car, but it's all in my name, and she pays me for the payment/insurance each month. What all would this involve if I wanted the loan to be in her name? Would I technically be ""selling"" her the car and have taxes to pay? Could I just add her on the loan just to build her credit? Would there be fees to change everything over? Would she end up with a  different interest rate? Is this even possible? What about insurance? Lots of questions, but maybe talking with the credit union would be best.

3. I have a credit card that I pay the balance on each month, and just use it to earn some reward points/etc. I could add her as an authorized user. It's through Chase.


Also, wanted to mention:

The insurance on her car is in my name, and I have homeowners insurance through the same company which gives me a discount on both, so if we have to change all that over, that may end up costing us more each month on insurance.

dogecoin,Side chains paper discussion! What if Dogecoins was to merge with bitcoin as a side chain?,"""How would altchains merge with sidechains on a protocol level?

Altchain is a generic term that includes both altcoins and sidechains. If you mean “Can an altcoin chain be a sidechain too?” The answer is yes. You can read more about this in section “6.1 Hashpower attack resistance”, in the point “Subsidy”.

If one wanted to turn an existing altchain into a sidechain or sidechain-compatible altchain, it would need to (just like Bitcoin) either use a softfork or federated pegging. Once that is in place, it would be up to the other sidechains whether they wish to accept that altchain’s assets being moved in or not in addition to (or instead of) bitcoins. If the current altchain is also desired to accept other assets (like bitcoins) being transferred in as a parallel asset to its native altcoin, it would be easiest done as a hardfork.""

personalfinance,I'm young(22) and wondering where I should put my money to get the greatest return out of my money in the future.,"I just got promoted to full time at my job and got offered a benefits package which got me thinking about retirement. I've been doing some research on my own and I'm wondering what I should be doing with my money to get ahead. Here are the options I've found:

* 401k (employer sponsored)
* IRA
* CD's
* HSA (employer sponsored)
* Investment certificates in employer

I opted for putting up to the cap that my employer would match into my 401k because it's free money(they are treating as traditional, I'm treating as Roth). Within my 401k I'm putting it all into Small/Mid U.S. Equity as I have many years before I'm taking it out and I've been told that over the long run that would be the best option. I opened up an IRA(Roth) yesterday at my local bank and put the minimum in it needed to collect insurance. I'm also putting the cap into my HSA that my employer will match.

Currently I'm paying off 2 student loans with a total of about 4k into them with interest rates of 3.4% and 5% each. I'm trying to pay the higher one off first to pay less in interest overall. I'm a little lost on what to do after they are paid off though. My IRA collects interest at a rate of .25% where as if I were to put that money into a CD at my bank, I'd get interest rates from .25% to 1.6% pending on the amount/length of time I opted to leave it in for. My employer also offers investment certificates that I can buy for $100 each that (iirc) can be sold back after a certain amount of time for $104 though I'm not sure on the length of time or the other limitations about that.

What would be the best option for me to take after my loans are paid off? Should I just leave my 401k at it's cap, and invest all the rest into my IRA until I hit the cap for that then invest into CD's? Should I try to invest in my 401k till I hit that cap and then put the rest into an IRA ignoring CD's? Should I just leave my IRA alone and save money to invest in a Jumbo CD that requires $100k that gives 1.75%? Should I be Investing about evenly in all of them? I'm just unsure what to do but I do know I want to invest for my future. Also, any options for investing I may have looked over, that would be a good idea, would be appreciated to hear about. 

Edit: I have read the FAQ and It did help me with wondering about the IRA vs. 401k debate, but let's say I max my 401k contributions for the year and still have money left over, do I put my money into CD's, my IRA, or Investment Certificates?",finance,1414175377

personalfinance,$100k Private Student Loans in Collections...What can I do??,"New to reddit -  really looking for some help



**Background Information:**  
I spent years paying what I could for my private student loans as I was not making enough money to make the full payments at the time. They then got sent to a collection agency where they tacked on some steep fees (~$20k), so I talked with a lawyer about my options. It came down to filing for bankruptcy or paying the collection agency $1250/month. The payments went from about $750/month to $1250/month after going to this agency. I was kind of weary about filing for bankruptcy as I was not exactly sure how this would impact the situation or my life so I chose to try to make the $1250/month work.



**Current Payment Method and Savings:**  
I have been making these payments for about 9 months now in addition to my federal loan monthly payments. My entire paycheck is going to these loans and I am unable to make more than the minimum payment. 

These are my current balances and interest rates:  
$13,201.07 - 6.70%  
$14,430.00	- 6.70%  
$13,232.00 - 6.55%  
$12,882.00	- 6.55%  
$18,315.37 - 7.92%  
$24,462.00 - 7.92%  

Current Savings: $5,000  


**Options to Consider:**  
I have called and spoken with the agency many times and feel like I get a different answer every time. I asked if it would be beneficial to throw $3k at one of the loans and I was told I would be better off saving up to settle one of the loans completely (they would take off some of the fees). After hearing this my plan was to try to save up enough money to completely pay off the smallest loan (~$9k), but I recently found out that this would not put much of a dent in the minimum monthly payment (it would go down $150/month). 

Also, since these monthly payments are so high, it is nearly impossible to save any money to try to do this. I am essentially waiting until I get my yearly bonus at the end of March and hoping I can negotiate a nice raise. Is it even worth it for me to try this method? Would I be better off putting the money I have now towards one of the loans or is there a better option? I feel like I am going to be trapped making these payments and never be able to move out of my parents’ house and afford rent. This problem has been hanging over me since I've graduated and makes me feel so helpless. 

Is there anything I can do to lower these monthly payments? Is there any kind of consolidating or refinancing I can do with a private loan that has gone into default that would lower the payments? Should I consider filing for bankruptcy? Has anyone experienced anything similar to this? What is the best way to handle this? Please help!

We have both lived on our own in college for most of the time while in college and are now living at home until we find a house. Her goal is to find a house that is no more than $250,000 but I believe we can afford maybe up to $300,000. We have found many homes we like but disagree on how much we are willing to pay and how much is to much. She grew up very poor and is very afraid of living paycheck to paycheck. I am more of the type who tends to crunch numbers and do research on money saving, retirement, and etc. 

I check PF daily and you all have helped me so much with the advice you guy others. Please help us decide what would could pay monthly and not live pay check to pay check. 


My Salary/Expenses:

I work for the state and get paid on the 15th and the 30th. After insurance, 401k, and other contributions I roughly make $900/check

Salary - $1800/month

$1000 personal loan - $54/month
Internet - $35/month
$24000 student loans - $93/month 
$2400 credit card (engagement ring) - $200/month
Rent (goes to my parents) - $450/month 
Food/Groceries - $200/month
Gas - $150/month

Total: $1182/month

Leaves me with roughly $620/month

I have $2500 in savings roughly right now and try to contribute $200 per check.

My fiancees Pay/Expenses

As a Registered Nurse she gets paid per hour and her checks varies depending on what days she work (nights and weekends) and holidays but she generally brings home $1700 every two weeks. 

Pay - 3400/month (roughly)

Expenses:

Car - $600/month (owes 3 more years)
Car Insurance - $130/month
Phone - $70/month
Cable - $245/month (she pays it for her household)
Student loan - $80/month
Gas - $140/month
Food/Groceries - $300/month
Credit Card - $200/month

Total: $1765/month

Leaves her roughly $1635


I put these numbers together kind of quick and of course some of this will change once we live together.


Please help us make some decisions. Ofcourse I understand I didnt not provide much information such as interest rates and things but I am really just looking for general tips on what we should look for and how much we may need to save and such.

I was always terrible with my finances. I haven't signed up for a 401K with the new job yet to help pay off a credit card debt (about $2500). This is my budget sheet after signing up for 401K @ 8% (company matches 50% up to 3% of our salary):

About $18,000 in my 401K from previous jobs. 

No savings / emergency fund. 

Rent is actually $2100 a month but I split it with my girlfriend who makes significantly less than I do (we live in an expensive city). She pays $600 and the electric and cable bill (which is really low). I can't cut cable or cell phone because I need it in my line of work in case I work from home. 

My car is my transportation to work. My AES student loan minimum payment is $200, but it has the highest interest rate so I'm technically paying it off avalanche style (not snowball). Groceries are split between the both of us and we bring out own lunches to work as much as we can. 

I just feel like my ""extra money"" which would go into savings or fun stuff is pretty damn low. I freelance at the moment which brings in an extra $500 or so a month but I can't rely on that consistently. 

How am I doing? Should I continue to make over the minimum payment on one of the student loans or save up for an emergency fund first?",finance,1414193079

TOTAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT ~ $88,460


I have no savings.

I haven't made a payment on a student loan for several years.  I switched gears and began to take nursing pre-reqs in 2012.  I'm currently on a medical leave from my nursing program.  I'm working a part time job with sporadic side gigs amounting to ~$1,500/mo income.  I will be working much less once I'm back in my program in a few weeks (~$750/mo) and hope to pick up work during school breaks.

Once my loan reimbursement kicks out in late November / early December, I'll have roughly $13,000 to get me from then to the beginning of my nursing career.  I'm optimistic and plan on having a job lined up soon after passing my boards in mid June.  Still, I would like to budget myself out through July in the instance that I don't start right away.

$13,000 through 8 months gives me $1,625/mo guaranteed income.
I can't say for certain I'll have work on the side so I want to budget based on that figure.


Monthly Bills:


Rent - $500

Utilities (g/w/e/i) ~ $120

Phone - $100

Trans (gas/tolls/car ins/public trans)- $180

Food (for me, the hardest to budget/not overspend) - $325
I figure $200 for groceries and &lt; $125 for eating on the go.

CC Payments - $400

Total - $1,625/mo

This doesn't leave room for the misc expenses of being a human (TP, beer, cat owning, etc) but its the rough budget I'm starting with.  Next phase is going through my past couple month's statements and seeing where the money is really going (probably coffee &amp; quick food).

I have been rather reckless in my 20s and so, this is where I'm at.  I am really excited to begin my new career and make a decent living and I know more income won't change poor habits, so this is the beginning of the changes I will be making!

Thanks for any tips or resources on managing finances you can provide.  I've been continually impressed by the redditors that offer advice on this sub and the great achievements folks have shared here.

Cheers!

For reasons beyond the scope of this post, I do not have sufficient liquid cash to pay this lump sum. My assets are in a retirement account (~$6k) and in my car's equity (~$10k). If I used savings to pay for this service, I would be very exposed if I had a medical emergency or something. I work in a job that pays a good portion of yearly salary in year-end bonuses, so I am 99% sure that I will have this cash by January 1st, but applications are due the first week of January. It is not an option to wait for my bonus and pay in cash.

I decided to finance the expense through an unsecured personal loan (this does not count as an educational loan). My bank (where I have checking and savings accounts) does not offer unsecured loans, so I had to use another bank with which I do not have accounts or a history. My plan is to take out the maximum amount I would need, make the monthly payments for the two bridge months until January, then pay off the entire loan. My cost of financing would be the amortized interest paid in those two monthly payments.

I was approved and received the terms, and the interest rate was a usurious 24% (!) for a 60-month loan. If I paid off this loan as planned, I would have paid 5% of the loan amount in interest! With 3-month T-bills yielding 0.02%, I was mostly upset how much the bank was going to rake in.

investing,SEC’s Stein builds bridges with startup businesses,"By Patrick Temple-West
10/24/14 10:12 AM EDT

Maturing startup companies are finding it harder to raise money from angel investors and venture capital firms, said Securities and Exchange Commission Democrat Kara Stein, even as it has become easier to secure funding from a wider array of smaller investors through crowdfunding.

Stein, in a phone interview on Thursday from Los Angeles, where she met with startup companies, said this dynamic is one reason for her agency to quickly finalize fundraising rules laid out in the 2012 JOBS Act.

But Stein and other Democrats have been wary of loosening rules that would allow small businesses to raise money from more sources out of concern it could lead the way to more fraud. When the SEC proposed crowdfunding rules in October 2013, Stein warned the proposal “may provide great risks to investors.” Republicans want the SEC to approve rules quickly with minimal burdens imposed on small businesses.

Stein emphasized the need for her agency to quickly finalize fundraising rules, but said her positions on crowdfunding have not changed and declined to comment on what specifics she wants to be included in the final rules.

“We need to be constantly vigilant that we are protecting capital formation,” Stein said, adding that “we need to get our crowdfunding rules done.”

Earlier in the day, she met with fundraising suitors and investors at the “Startup Garage” at the University of Southern California’s School of Engineering.

Stein said she was surprised to hear some of the fundraising fundamentals have flipped so that it is now easier to raise money on crowdfunding website Kickstarter, for example, than from sophisticated investors.

“The paradigm has shifted,” Stein said. “I heard from a number of people at the roundtable that it is easier to get smaller amounts of capital, $10,000 to $20,000, but that it was harder to get up to the next level. It is actually harder to get investments from the angel investors and investor firms.”

In Washington, Stein and her fellow commissioners are weighing how best to finalize the proposed crowdfunding and other rules the agency must adopt as part of the 2012 JOBS Act. Those rules have stalled as the agency grapples with finishing writing rules stemming from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.

In a speech Stein is scheduled to give later on Friday, she is expected to propose options for the little-used ""Regulation A"" exemption, which the SEC is considering changing.

The rules would allow businesses to raise up to $50 million over a year without having to register the offerings with the agency.

The SEC’s proposed rules said that the new stock and debt sales would be able to sidestep state regulations that critics say are too costly.

Stein is expected to offer that exchange-listed offerings would be subject to federal review but that over-the-counter offerings would be reviewed in a fast, efficient state-coordinated process.

“Reg A-plus might be the thing that could help get them to the next level,” Stein said, referring to the startup companies.

personalfinance,"Drowning in $4,325 worth of debt","Hi /r/

I have a total crushing debt of $4,325 on three cards and I am behind on two. I have paid one for the month and am planning onto the next, but this will leave me with the third card unpaid. 

I've tried to apply for Debt Consolidation loan and was systematically denied because my ""income"" is too low (They questioned if it was the correct 'income' I listed on the application when I spoke to them over the phone. 7 days later I received a nice ""denied"" letter in the mail.). I have tried to apply for extra-side jobs without success. I don't know if that can be considered discrimination to apply for Debt Consolidation then get denied for it because of income. 

I don't know what to do anymore. It has come down to deciding to pay off a credit bill or holding onto the money to make sure there is food to eat or at least, some money stored back. There is one Credit-Card holder with a horrible interest rate that had decided to raise up up my minimum on a card on that was steady, and because of that card-holder, I was unable to pay the other two cards on-time. They also caused my card to go over the limit,then tagged on an extra ""over-limit"" fee on top of it as a double-whammy. I do have however, a strong history of paying my Credit-Cards on-time. 

The phone is blasted with these CC's because of the bills. It's very tiresome and very stressful. I feel poor, I feel beaten, and I feel cheated.

Here is the debt ratio per card:

$1,659.50
$1,566.24
$1,042.78

Here is my average income:

$69-$112

So currently, I am stuck with the amount of hours/wages I can get.

financialindependence,Is the Roth conversion ladder a sound strategy? Has anybody successfully done it?,"[Mad FIentist](http://www.madfientist.com/traditional-ira-vs-roth-ira/) and [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/11/11/how-much-is-too-much-in-your-401k/) both speak highly of the Roth conversion ladder. The idea is most people (particularly FI types) have a lot of money in their pre-tax 401(k). To access it early without penalty, you rollover to a Traditional IRA, convert to Roth (paying taxes, if any; if you keep the conversion amount low and can live off of capital gains taxed at 0% in the 15% federal income tax bracket you may pay no federal income tax), then in 5 years you can access the money from your Roth IRA without penalty or tax.

However, I've heard on another site that there's a catch to the strategy: you can only withdraw the principal of your contributions, not their earnings. I believe this is referring to the earnings even going back to the 401(k). Mad FIentist doesn't allude to this, but MMM does say:

&gt; At this point, you can withdraw all of the principal (but not the gains yet, no big deal), penalty-free!

It's not clear to me if they mean the earnings while seasoning for 5 years in the Roth IRA, or while in the 401(k) and/or Traditional IRA.

I have always been under the impression that the entire amount converted to Roth is available for withdraw after 5 years without tax or penalty. If it's only the principal, it may not be as useful.

Can somebody provide a definitive answer on this, ideally citing IRS sources? I'm also curious, has anybody successfully executed this entire strategy, going from a pre-tax 401(k) to withdrawing tax- and penalty-free from a Roth IRA 5 years later?

Edit: TL;DR: I put $1 into a pre-tax 401(k). It earns an additional $1. I rollover to Traditional IRA, then convert to Roth. In 5 years it earns an additional $1. Everybody seems to agree I can withdraw the first $1 tax- and penalty-free. What about the second and third dollars?",finance,1414243738
personalfinance,*Need serious help understanding Loans..Consolidation.. what is best for me?*,"Hello PF! 

Graduated May 2013 and growing an immense hatred for student loan debt.

Before I begin, I will be very honest. I've been incredibly oblivious to loans/debt/interest and personal finance. Many thanks to this subreddit for opening my eyes and gaining interest and great concern for my finances!

Currently, I have a total of (6) federal loans, that seem to have been consolidated without my authorization. All of these loans were bundled up together before I began payment so I was not even aware that consolidation WAS even an option for repayment. 

I am trying to understand the numbers. I went on the Consolidation estimator to see what is best for me, but that did not help whatsoever. I've contacted Fed Loans to see why/how/when this all occurred. My best interest is to pay off my smallest loans, which also have the higher interest rates. 

Please see loan details below -- (current principal balance listed)

Loan 1 - $5,191.57 (3.15%)

Loan 2- $5,104.15 (3.15%)

Loan 3- $3,262.19 (4.25%)

Loan 4- $2,007.89 (6.55%) 

Loan 5- $2,138.25 (6.55%)

Loan 6- $2,258.81 (6.55%) 

Minimum payment has been $225.69 for all 6, which have been my monthly payments for the past year. (yes, realizing now that this was not the smartest thing) 

Therefore, I've increased my direct debit to an addtional $75 so that my monthly payment is $300 (which still isn't much, but all i can afford at the moment)

My monthly income is about $1,962. 

My question is to just understand what is best for me. I've been reading several posts, where redditors recommended others to pay these loans separately, rather than consolidating due to the higher interest rates, lack of borrower benefits, etc.

Please advise (as kindly as possible!) if I am not understanding something correctly, as I am VERY new to this.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on my financial situation- 26 y/o went through some rough spots and I want to get back on track!,"I figured after lurking here for months I would get some advice on my own situation. In May of this year I left an emotionally abusive relationship of 3+ years- we weren't married. I broke up with him after I found out he was cheating but it turned out to be the best decision I could have made. We never went on a vacation, hardly ate out, and generally stayed at home while he played video games/watched TV and got wasted almost every night. He would buy toys or video games first then contribute towards bills whereas all my money went towards our expenses and food, etc.  It was bad all around.  After the relationship ended, my first priority was getting my mental health in a better place and dealing with depression and PTSD, and now I'm doing better it's time to get the rest of me on track!   I keep inexpensive hobbies right now and I'm fairly introverted. I'm generally pretty frugal, I try to buy bulk when I can and when it makes sense fiscally, I don't go out to coffee often (maybe every other month as a treat), I generally stay home most nights and if I do go out on the weekend most of my friends are broke as well so we go to each others houses. I am happier, healthier (physically and mentally), and 110% better off than I was at the start of this year.  Now it's time to get my finances back on a tangible plan.
 



I had already been trying to adjust my budget to reduce costs  (alcoholics are expensive, believe it or not, especially when they hide their alcohol around the house and it's hard to tell where money is going) after reading some great financial books and lurking here I was working on building up our savings. After I kicked him out, I was left with a bunch of unpaid bills and less income (he worked part time and would often get called of early so it was sporadic but it helped) than I planned for that month. We also had a joint account for bills that he took half of before he left, leaving me with less saved up money for bills.Then I had to pay for therapy, etc.- I would then using all my paycheck money to pay off the credit card which I had to use to pay for bills. I would have little left over in my account until next payday, therefore needing to use credit card again, etc. etc..  It was always getting paid off but then I'd be stuck using it again for the next months bills.  I almost drained my emergency savings trying to play catch up (there wasn't much in there yet, about 900.00). Anyways, I decided to stop the madness and after reading this subreddit, the FAQ, and other resources this past week or so I got a better game plan.  I did not use my most recent paycheck to pay part of my card but instead used my debit card for all transactions and have completely ceased the use of my card until it is paid off and I'm in a better situation.  Also, I am 26 y/o female with a B.A. for reference. Income wise- I have a few promotional opportunities coming up and will be getting a pay raise next year so things are looking up. I just started doing some freelancing work in my free time but that hasn't made more than a few dollars yet so I haven't included that yet. Anyways, now you know the lengthy backstory, here is a breakdown of my situation:
 



This month (October) I just started getting insurance taken out so my income has decreased- they took double out so I would be a month ahead so this month was extremely tight.


**Gross Income**

2800.00 gross per month

From my paycheck I have a 3% contribution to retirement in lieu of Social Security. I am a government employee and we pay into a state plan instead. (employer pays 4% for 7% total).  I also contribute 4% pretax to a 457 deferred comp plan.  


My health insurance is 216.00 per month deducted from gross amount.  (For October 432.00 was deducted)  
Here is a breakdown of net income/expenses with some explanations.  


**Net Income**

2096.00 net monthly (As of November going forward- my income for October was 1880.00)  


**Expenses**  
680.00 Mortgage  
240.00~ Electric/water/garbage  
100.00 gas for car  
280.00 groceries/restaurants (Groceries are usually 230 ish, I eat pretty healthy but do need to get better at shopping sales/using coupons.  I eat out maybe 1-3 times per month with friends and try to keep it inexpensive)  
120.00 cable/internet (This is something I have looked at cutting- however to keep internet would be 90.00 as a current customer, and I have to pay a technician to come out.  Early next year I am eligible for a promotion for the price bump to down to 90.00)  
15.00 Netflix   
70.00 dog food  
42.00 cell phone (I'm on my parents plan and pay for my data only which I am VERY grateful for)  
100.00 misc purchases (household items like lightbulbs, stamps, services like haircut, etc.)  
100.00 personal loan payment (this is flexible, some months it's been less)  
25.00 savings towards home improvement project savings account   
Total Expenses: 1772.00  


**Leftover**- 324.00 (This used to go into savings/Roth)



I have one checking/savings that I use for my everyday use.  I would like to get the checking up to include a months expenses, I have 475.00 in my checking as of today. I have no outstanding bills at this time, my mortgage is paid up to 12/01, the last thing I used my card for was gas on 10/22 so my tank is full. I get paid next on 11/07.



I also have budgeted other expenses that are not monthly, I'm labeling them as ANNUALLY just to make it easier:

**Annual Expenses**


300.00 vet bill/pet misc (check up/shots, flea/tick medicine, etc.)

300.00 medical/co-pays/RX 

1300.00 car insurance (it is billed every 6 months for me)

200.00 misc home repairs/upkeep

500.00 misc car upkeep

100.00 christmas/birthdays for family/friends (Starting next year, this year I am doing homemade gifts that I already have all the supplies for)

2700.00  annual

*Ideally I would use my secondary checking/savings account with another bank for these larger/more infrequent expenses so I can automate monthly transfers to this account and use it when I need to.  So far this account has a measly 250.00 in it.  I will need to build it up more by next summer because I've already had most of my appointments, check-ups, tune-ups etc. fairly recently.  The only upcoming large expense will be car insurance in February which is 650.00 for 6 months.

**Assets/Other info**


Amount owed on credit card: 1300.00 (14% interest rate, minimum payment 25.00.  I paid 250.00 already for this billing cycle so next payment isn't due until December.  They have not charged me any interest yet so far -I'm not entirely sure why.  I've reviewed the policies and I think it's because I pay off the old balances by the time the new cycle starts maybe?  I've had a rolling balance of 400.00-1400.00 per month since July/August)


Roth IRA: 4660.00 

Employment retirement accounts (combined): 9,800.00

Emergency savings: 275.00 

Investments: 400.00 in stocks/ETFs

House mortgage: 104,000.00 owed (interest rate is 4.25%, I've owned the house for a year and a half and I used to make extra 50.00-100.00 principal only payments here and there when finances where better.  The house is in generally good condition but it was built in the 80s and has a lot of the original appliances, I had to get a new water heater, A/C and fridge.  There is a lot of minor/medium work and upgrades to be done but nothing dire yet.)  

Personal loan: 20,600.00 owed still (My parents helped me with down payment on house and some immediate repairs/new air conditioner/heater. There is no interest on the loan.  I just write them a check on payday and give it to them.  If anything happens around the house they would help pay for it and add it to the loan.  It was their idea to buy the house and do a rent-to-own to me but we found out I could afford the house payments myself so they decided to help me buy it so I could build equity in the house myself.  They help me out a TON with being a newish homeowner)




I have no student loan debt, I own my car outright, no other debts besides the credit card balance, my mortgage, and personal loan.  




**My eventual goals are these (NOT IN ORDER)** 

- Build my checking up so that I can pay directly from there and not have to rely on credit for my basic expenses.  
-Save for yearly expenses so I do not have any ""surprises"" that I should have planned for better. 
-Pay off credit card  
- Start contributing to Roth again and then max out Roth contributions. (Obviously not happening this year and probably not next year).   
- Build up emergency fund for 6 months of expenses ~10k. (I am secure in my job and am essentially the same as being a tenured, it would be extremely difficult to lose my job at this time if that makes a difference with anyone evaluating my priorities.  I will still be nervous until I have 1-2k for any personal/car/house emergencies.)  
-Contribute to investments and maybe open a mutual fund or something once I am in a better place.  
-Save for house renovations/improvement projects  



I'm so sorry for the length of this, I know I'm wordy and over-explain everything.  It helps me also get a grasp of my situation because it's been such a chaotic year BUT an amazing past few months being healthy and happier. If I didn't explain something or you have any questions about something that seems weird let me know.




I have a lot that I want to get done and not a lot of money to do it with so I'd like help figuring out a timeline on what to tackle first. Covering my expenses should be first so I can get ahead of bills and not be rolling a balance anymore with my credit card.  I have a few ideas on what to do but would really appreciate anyone's advice or their take on my situation. 

**Here are some of the questions rolling around in my brain for you:**


-What should be my plan going forward...my next paycheck on 11/07 will be 1048.00- how should I split this up saving for bills/credit card payment/etc. and how long should it take to pay off the credit card?   

-In my situation, what percentage of my ""leftover"" money should I be contributing to where, and how much should I pay towards my credit card per month while still contributing towards my annual expenses?    

-I get an extra paycheck in February, what would be the best use of this as this is not budgeted towards anything?  Same with my tax return- I'm estimating from the IRS calculator about a 300.00 return so far.
   
-Once I start making a little extra income from freelancing I was going to set aside half for taxes (If I make over 400.00- I don't anticipate I'll go over that this year.  I'll maybe make a extra 100-200 bucks for 2014) and put the rest towards any credit card debt- is this a good plan or should I do something else?   

-When I do get more income mid-next year from my raise, it will  be a 5% raise so not raking in that much extra.  Where should I put this extra income?    

-Anything else?

personalfinance,Is this is a wise plan and other questions.,"My grandmother recently passed away and left me $14,000. I've read the PF FAQ and I'd like PF's thoughts on the plans my wife and I have for the money based on our situation.

**Our Financial Situation:**

 My wife has a full-time job and I receive a stipend while I complete my PhD (2-3 year before I finish my dissertation). Since getting married, we have followed PF's recommendations: we have an emergency fund for 6 months of expenses and my wife contributes the maximum amount that her employer will match to her 401K (6%). We have also developed a budget and are pretty good at sticking to it, usually have anywhere from ~$200-1,000 left over a month depending on the month--I don't receive my stipend in the summer. We'd like to put more towards our savings, but it is tough right now since only my wife receives a full salary and I only make a stipend. I am looking into opportunities on the side that I could do though to supplement our income without taking time and energy away from completing my dissertation--it is my last step then I can find a full-time, well-paying job. Other than my wife's 401K, we have no long-term retirement savings.

We have a car loan and I have student loans:

Car Loan: 

Current Principal Balance $13,435.01 @2.990%; Monthly $234.40

Private Student Loans:

* $20,226.50 @ 3.15%; Monthly $129.14
* $24,638.10 @ 3.160%; Monthly $143.40
* $13,699 @ 2.410%; In Grace until March

Federal Student Loans:

* Stafford Subsidized: $5,500 @ 5.6%; In Deferment
* Stafford Subsidized: $3,500 @ 6.8%; In Deferment
* Stafford Unsubsidized:  $6,500 @ 6.8%; In Deferment

I am currently paying the minimum balance on the two private loans in repayment. I was putting extra money towards another unsub. stafford loan that I just finished paying off. It had a 6.8% int. rate. I took all of these loans out during my undergrad--bad decision in hindsight.

**The Plan:**

We our considering using the $14k to payoff the unsub. stafford loan of $6,500. The payoff amount is ~$9,150. Is this a wise decision?

We do not know what to do with the remaining ~$5,000. Should we put it towards another one of the loans? We've also considered putting it in a CD for a few years but are not sure if it is worth it considering a 5 year CD would, at most, get 2% whereas the loan interest rates are higher. We've also considered placing the $5K into a long-term mutual fund. What does PF think?

Other Question:

We are considering switching banks. At out current bank (PNC), our savings account, which holds our emergency fund, only earns .35% APY. We opened this account back when we both lived in an area where PNC has many branches. PNC has no branches in our current location. We've found that we don't have much of a need for brick and mortar banks. So, we are thinking about moving our savings and checking to Ally to earn the better APY. Thoughts?

Thank you all for your help.",finance,1414259421
personalfinance,You think your students loans are bad?,"Hi all, 

I've thoroughly enjoyed learning from the experience of everyone on this forum.  I thought I'd throw in my situation and see if anyone could weigh in on my options.  Also, you might be interested in the real world situation of a recent medical school graduate.  

So here goes, I just graduated medical school and am in my first year of residency.  I'm fortunate to have matched into good programs with a good prospect of a future job, but I currently have significant, and I mean significant student loan debt.  I'm trying to responsibly face this, and do whatever I can to make things better for me later.  I will have a total of 5 years in residency, making about $50K up to $60K annually.  If I then do one year of fellowship, I'll make maybe $65K for that year.  Then as an attending I could be making around $200K - $250K, though this is very quickly changing and hard to predict.  

My debt:
Federal loans - Consolidated Direct Loans $304,000 at 7.57%
Private loans - $86,000 at 5%

My Plan:
I have applied and qualified for PAYE, and plan on doing the 10 year PSLF on the federal loans.  So I am making the minimum required payments through the PAYE system (why pay extra if the excess will be forgiven?) This will only work if the forgiveness amount isn't capped at $57K, which is currently being proposed as part of next year's federal budget.  Otherwise, I could probably make the difference working in the private sector.  

My question comes in with the private loans.  I want to pay these as aggressively as possible, but also put some money towards retirement.  With my salary, after rent/utilities/insurance/food/gas/etc., I will have about $1000 per month to put towards these loans and/or retirement.  Should I be maxing out a Roth IRA? Or paying only to loans, though paying them off during my residency would not be feasible?

I could probably eek out a little more per month, but live with and support my wife and young child.  I want to find that balance of living well within my means and not making our lives miserable.  You only get to have your children when they are young once, or so I've been told. 

I should say, my employer does not have a 401K match, otherwise contributing to that would make most sense.  I have a good emergency fund put away (about 6 months of expenses), so can move to the next step.   

Thanks for any advice!",finance,1414264260

Unfortunately, the GOP, as a whole, is not better on those issues.  So, with that out of the way here's just some of the GOPs awful positions and doings and it is by no means a complete list.  Most of them correspond to their tireless work for big biz at the expense of the non very rich.

* Climate change deniers and anti-science in general.  This is an odd alliance between anti-environment pro biz evangelicals and fossil fuel; a GOP funding backbone (Kochs et. al.) 
* Against reproductive rights including, now, even birth control.  In general, the GOP seems to view women as second class citizens.
* Tax breaks for the rich, i.e. Supply side/Tinkle down economics - It's never worked for over 30 years.  Look at Kansas.  That doesn't stop the GOP because the rich are their benefactors and that's what they want.
* Shutting down the gov't which led to the sequester which slowed the recovery.
* Refusing to extend health care benefits to the poor vis-a-vis the almost free Medicare expansion.  This will leads to thousands of preventable deaths every year.  Pro Life?
* Blocking the reducing of student loan interest rates forcing them to pay much higher rates than they should and letting the gov't make a profit from them.  Blocking laws to deal with the problem of private colleges scamming students, and in particular veterans, out of education and the gov't out of money.
* Blocking the raising of the minimum wage
* The sequester slowing down the recovery (est -0.6% GDP, 750K jobs)
* Refusing to extend unemployment in a recession
* Obstructing bank reform
* Pushing for looser oil drilling regs post Horizon spill
* Getting nothing done BY EXPLICIT DESIGN (as per Mitch McConnel's statement in 2008)
* Blocking spending on huge infrastructure backlog to ensure a slower recovery regardless of the $2 Trillion backlog on our decaying infrastructure.
* Blocking the Surgeon General nomination to suit the NRA (for syaing GSWs are a health issue)
* Blocking any gun reform whatsoever
* Disenfranchising millions of poor people from voting.  Studies have shown the voter fraud is virtually non existent and impractical but now millions of poor can't vote because of the requirement for difficult to obtain IDs
* Blocking the nomination to head the Consumer Protection Agency- Because, well, Corporations first.
* Against Internet neutrality
* Against green/renewable energy
* For unlimited money in elections because money is speech and corporations are people.
* Keeping the identities of large donors secret.
* Blocking UN Disabilities treaty",energy,1414264645

personalfinance,Student loan company is giving me the run-around. Possibly on purpose. Any tips for straightening things out?,"Currently on no income. I'm staying with family, but family lives in the middle of nowhere. At this point I can't even get a minimum wage job in walking distance and don't have transportation for anything else. I've been doing odd-jobs where I can to sort it out, but in the mean time my student loans are my only serious financial obligation.

About ten months ago I tried calling the company that handles my loans to work something out. It was FedLoan back then, switched to Sallie Mae and now I'm being moved to Navient which I guess is the same company but a different name, I'm not sure of the purpose here.

Anywho, I called FedLoan the first time and they suggested a 3-month unemployment deferrment to start while I simultaneously applied for income based repayment. As long as my income is zero, the payment is zero. I filled that out as soon as the paperwork arrived.

Before I got a determination (whether I qualify, I guess?) I heard that I'd been switched to Sallie Mae. They had no idea I'd even applied. Cue from the top. This time, however, they sent me a handy link that allowed me to fill out the information online and link directly to my tax return at the IRS website. I received notification a few weeks later that I had not submitted all necessary documentation. (It's possible here that the problem was my tax return. I didn't make any taxable income the previous year, so my tax returns were a year older than expected.)

I called up Sallie Mae and asked about the problem. The lady I spoke to said, quote, ""I can't access that information. I can't even verify that you were sent such a response from us.""

Whatever. Time for round three. (With a new tax return, by this point) At her request, I extended the deferrment and I filled out the paperwork again. This time it was a printed PDF. 9 pages of text with only two requiring actual information and mailing back. I read these twice through to ensure I missed nothing. Two weeks later, ""You failed to submit required information. Your request is still pending.""

I called back and spoke to another woman who used different words, but to the same effect, ""We did not send you that reply. Your request is pending, but I'm not able to determine what you didn't send in.""

Now, I'm on Navient. I haven't called them yet because I'm so damn frustrated.(I still have a few days before the next payment is due.) I make literally zero dollars a year right now. My tax return from last year was less than $6000 which I'm pretty sure is at or very close to poverty level. I want to pay these loans back (relatively small amount, considering. Around $5,000 total over three loans), but at the moment my circumstances don't allow it. I'm running out of deferrment and can't seem to get the problem sorted on my own. Any ideas about who I should ask to speak to? Previous CSRs haven't even been able to connect me with someone who can find out what my paperwork is missing. Given the number of times and ways I've tried to apply, it's becoming really hard to believe that I'm the one making the mistake here. I don't want to wreck my credit or lose the ability to go back to school in the future, but don't know how else to deal with this.",finance,1414293523

personalfinance,Should I use my emergency fund to pay off my uncaptalized student loan interest?,"Hello, I've been a long timer lurker of /r/personalfinance and have picked up a ton of great information here. I'm looking for a little advise on how to handle my student loans that will go into repayment in March 2015.

I graduated from college last May and began working in June. My current salary is $61,000 before taxes and I have approximately $88,000 in student loans. ~$29,000 is in federal loans and the rest are all private loans. My current capitalized interest is as follows:




Loan | Uncapitalized Interest | Interest Rate | Total Loan Amount
----|----------------------|-------------|-----------------
Federal | $1,177.49 | ~4.5% | $29,000
Sallie Mae #1 | $1,352.57 | 8% | $23,050.51
Sallie Mae #2 | $2,078 | 7% | $19,215
Chase | ~4000 | 8.23% | $17,000

I have currently saved up $5,226 in my emergency fund by saving about $1,000 a month and plan on doing so until my loans go into repayment. So I'll have approximately $9,226 by March. I'm also contributing to my company matching 401k $456/mo and with my matching it bumps up to $571/mo. I generally always have around $1500 in my checking account at all times too that I view as money I can spend on things I want, it rarely ever drops below $1000 though.

So my main question is should I deplete my savings fund in order to knock off my uncapitalized interest? I figured at the very least I should get rid of the $4,000 since the interest rates are fairly high. I worry that once I start paying on my loans in March that I will not be able to contribute nearly as much to my emergency fund and obviously it will take a while to get back to the level I'm currently (or will be) at. I'm not too worried about being jobless. I went to a pretty prestigious private tech school (which is why I have high student loans) and have recruiters contacting me weekly. So this may give me a bit of a buffer on the emergency fund; however, I still don't want to just ignore it all together. 

Here is a breakdown of my current monthly expenses. I bring home about $3300 a month after taxes, 401k contributions and health insurance.



Bill | Amount
----|------
Rent | $1,000
Cellphone | $45
Netflix | $8
Spotify | $5
Electric | $20
Internet | $20
Groceries | $60

I don't track how much I spend eating out much but I would estimate ~200/mo. I can absolutely cut back on this if needed though.

personalfinance,"Put inheritance towards a better house now, or save it for later?","Hi PF,

My husband and I are about to buy our first house, and we've found ourselves in a fortunate position but we'd love your advice on how best to take advantage of it.

First, our situation:

We're renting right now for $1080/month, which is basically sustainable on my income alone. I make about $53k/year, I save 5% of that in my employer's 401k, and they match an additional 10%. After that tax advantaged retirement savings, taxes, expenses and rent, we're not saving anything extra, but we're not in the red either. My husband currently has no income, but that's because he just finished his degree and is looking for work. His field is less lucrative than mine so we can probably expect him to make something like $25-30k/year as soon as he finds something, but we don't know when that will be. We have nearly no debt whatsoever (his student loan is a few thousand at ~2%), so we've got that going for us, which is nice, but we're also planning on having a few kids in the next 5-6 years, which will cost however much kids cost.

So, on our own merits, we could probably afford a mortgage of about $925/month so that we can save a little extra for house maintenance, and hopefully save a lot more once my husband finds work. We have great credit and can put 20% down, so that puts our initial budget around $175k-$195k, which (in our city) equals a house and neighborhood in the okay to pretty good range.

But here's the plot twist:

We've had the good fortune of inheriting about $700k, which gives us some extra options. We're still inclined to take a mortgage rather than paying cash for a house, simply because we can get an interest rate below our expected long term investment return. Even so, with that safety net behind us, we could up our budget to the $270k-$310k range and get a great house in a great neighborhood. The mortgage would be closer to $1600/month which is more than our own incomes could cover (at least until I make more and/or he starts working), but the inheritance would cover the difference for the foreseeable future.

So the question is whether that's a good idea. I have the inheritance invested in broad, low-cost index funds (per /r/investing's advice) so it's not at huge risk, but a really serious market crash could theoretically put us into slightly nervous territory. We're also planning on a couple of kids in the not-too-distant future, so the less of that inheritance we spend now, the more we can have later to cover their education and even pass on to them. In principle we're also not thrilled about the idea of ""living beyond our means"" and using the inheritance to make up the difference.

And yet, it seems silly to have money if you're not willing to use it for anything, and a better house in a better neighborhood near better schools sure seems like it might be a justifiable investment in our family's future.

So, PF, what's your take? Is it worth using a chunk of this inheritance to get us an amazing ""forever home"" right away? Or should we keep the inheritance as a failsafe/for-the-kids fund and only buy a house we can currently afford by ourselves, even if that means having to move again in 5-10 years when we outgrow it?

Thanks for any advice!",finance,1414341948
Economics,"Article of the Week - ""Can Government Purchases Stimulate the Economy?"" (Ramey, 2011)","[Link](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~vramey/research/JEL_Fiscal_14June2011.pdf)

***

This week's nomination comes from /u/Integralds, who writes:

&gt; I'm submitting a long-overdue paper on fiscal multipliers. The paper I'm submitting is Valerie Ramey's 2011 JEL survey. I hope to have accompanying notes written up by the time discussion goes live, as I have provided in my past AotW discussions.

&gt; **Abstract**:

&gt; &gt; This essay briefly reviews the state of knowledge about the government spending multiplier. Drawing on theoretical work, aggregate empirical estimates from the United States, as well as cross-locality estimates, I assess the likely range of multiplier values for the experiment most relevant to the stimulus package debate: a temporary, deficit-financed increase in government purchases. I conclude that the multiplier for this type of spending is probably between 0.8 and 1.5.

&gt; Comments: Since interest rates have hit their effective zero lower bound in 2009, discussion of fiscal multipliers has renewed. This 2011 survey article synthesizes the results of over 25 estimates of the fiscal multiplier and offers useful comments.

Basically suggesting that their net asset value is higher than the price per share. They also pay very high dividends, monthly of about 8.5 cents per share, at the current share value of 8.7 dollars, that equates to a nice yearly yield. 

The company mainly provides Senior loans to small and medium sized businesses and based on the article it seems that the company's business is good and protected against rises in interest rates, and because it loans to so many companies, even a few defaults shouldn't cause a big strain on the company.

* Transportation is **$80**

* Insurance is still covered by my parents for the time being. 

* **8K** of debt, with repayments starting in january at a tiny interest rate (~2%). I've already been able to pay more than half by selling my car when I moved. The agreement right now is about 400 a month payment.  

* Food budget is almost always around **$400.** Though when i was working more it would be less since there was no time for drinking and eating out

These are pretty much my only expenses. My employer, however, doesn't offer a 401k plan, so while I'm able to save a decent amount I feel like I can't take full advantage of it since no matching is happening.

Right now it's a ""their house, their rules"" battle, and unfortunately for me the rest of the (distant/needs to mind their own issues) family is against me.

I do still have a minor's savings account at the bank where my parents have the large saving's accounts at. However, I am unable to get the bank tellers to turn over the paperwork for my parents to sign to hand the account over to me.  The interest rate sucks there, and my parent's can withdraw any money at will.

I've got a serious problem with my mom making me use my savings to pay for things that are hers. She really does force to go with her, with my money, to pay. Example, she was taking an accounting course at the same college I am enrolled in and I had to go down there and pay for the $400+ book/CD online package set, for a class which she eventually dropped. I know she's dipped into and snooped thorough my wallet &amp; piggy bank to see what all I have. I haven't cleaned my wallet out from the vacation from hell a few days ago, so there is still an emergency hundred dollar bill hidden in the one pocket; she asked when she could have it back. It was never hers. I'm going to fix that tonight.

So as you can see, I want to get this money into a bank account ASAP (like this week), at a local credit union. 

However, I am worried about being flagged (due to it being all cash) and made to account for every cent I have. So I don't know if I should deposit it all at once, or in increments over a period of time.  I also worry about being pulled over, while I complete this ""mission"", and having the money taken away from me by the police. Yes, Tennessee is one of those states where they, the police, can seize all money with out a warrant (calling it ""drug trafficking money"") and not give it back.

I do have a plan to get a job soon, whether my parent's like it or not, to help out with the credit/resumé problem. However, I need the next year's schooling schedules which aren't out yet. And I am mapping my new life out, thankfully I've been able to learn a lot by observing those around me. I know how to budget, write checks, cook, clean, etc.

If I have possibly forgotten anything or something isn't clear, please drop me a line and I will do my best to clear it up. Thanks in advance!",finance,1414387281

personalfinance,Should I sell my car? in desperate need for financial help. (KU),"Hello, 

  I am a 24 years single man from Kuwait. I started working almost two years ago and I make around $3870 a month. 

  Last year, I decided to buy a car, but I didn't have the money for it. So I financed it through a bank loan. At the time the car cost $51830. And I didn't have a down payment. 
  I took the loan for the whole amount at a 5% interest rate. I pay $984 a month. This all fine, and I don't pay rent because I live in our house (I inheretid it with my brother from my late father). 
  Now, after all these months, been 11 months exactly since I got the car. I sometimes start to feel that this is too much to pay, like a big chunk  out of my paycheck goes for nothing, but the car. So I started to feel that I should sell it and save up the money to travel. (I like traveling, and I get the chance to travel couple of times a year) 

Please help, I found a buyer, I would only lose around $2000 and where I will be able to close the remainder amount on the loan. 

What should I do? Should I sell it and use one of the old cars we have? 
I am worried that it will break down often, and I won't be saving any money. Should I keep it? I like it, it is a sports car that goes well with my age, and my social status. Since I am in Kuwait, these things are really important, the image and all, and also the thing is, is that I really like it. 

Please, if anyone have an insight on this, and may shed a better light of sense, I would really appreciate it. 

P.S: My mom encouraged me not to sell it, as she thinks that I make enough money to afford it. And I am sorry if I sound like a stuck up or an asshole. I am really not. 

Thank you.",finance,1414402919

personalfinance,"Put extra money in mortgage, savings or other?","I've been paying an extra $250 on our mortgage for a while now but am starting to wonder if I should be putting the money elsewhere.



The idea behind it was that the money would *hopefully* end up giving us a bigger check when we sell our current house. I'll never pay the house off before we sell it but $5,000 less we owe on the house when we sell it has to be a good thing. Now I'm wondering if it would be better in a savings account so that when we apply for a mortgage for our next house the bank will see we can save more money. Does this make sense?



I know the lender wanted months worth of pay stubs and bank account statements last time. Would it get us a better rate to have the money in savings rather than a lower outstanding balance on our mortgage?



Or do I do something completely different with the money like investing or something like that?



EDIT: We have about $100K in student loans ranging from 5.0 to 7.65% interest. We are paying a few hundred over the minimum on the two highest interest rate loans and a bit over minimum on the lower interest rate loans. We also have a $160 a month car loan payment. No other debt. We have a few months worth emergency fund in place. I put 6% of my paycheck into a 403B with 3% company match (it's the minimum amount to get the maximum match from the company). I'll eventually put more in (~10%) once my wife has a steady, full-time job (OT). We do not have any kids and won't for a few years. Our interest rate on the mortgage is 3.875%. Paying the minimum until a few months ago, our mortgage balance is about $3,000 less than when we got the house a year and a half ago for $88K.



I guess I just don't know what to do with the little extra money we have after paying our insane student loan bills, the mortgage and other monthly bills. Is it better to pay off those student loans even quicker? Better to put some toward the house so that when we sell it in a few years to upgrade we have a chunk of money to use toward the down payment on the next house? Just put it in savings and use it for the down payment on our next house? The debt with the highest interest rate is easily our student loans, then the mortgage followed by the car loan. Now that I'm thinking about it maybe it's better to pay off more of the student loans and use a portion of the $250 for savings towards the next down payment.",finance,1414431181

personalfinance,Looking to buy a new primary residence. Should I sell current one or rent it out?,"Using throwaway for this.

--Context--
My fiancee and I are considering buying our first home together. One of our primary motivations is to move into a district with better schools.

I currently own my residence with significant equity, a very low interest rate (3.375% 30-yr fixed) and monthly payment on the mortgage.

My primary question is, what's the best way to purchase our new primary residence. Should we sell my current home and make an offer on the new home with a contingency on the sale? Or should I keep and convert my current place to a rental, take out a line of credit on it, and use that to purchase the new home?

The properties we're interested are $900k-$1m range.

If it matters, I am 35 (and my fiancee doesn't like me telling others her age). We don't have kids but plan to have them within a few years.

--Our finances--

-Assets and Liabilities-
My primary residence has a $240k mortgage. I purchased 4 years ago at $550k and zillow says it's worth $740k. I don't believe this figure, but my neighbor sold his unit for $650k in the beginning of this year.

I co-own a couple of rental properties with a friend that have a (zillow) value of $380k. I have a $110k mortgage on one of them.

I have $80k in retirement and $70k in liquid accounts. Not sure of my fiancee's cash assets.

I have $20k in student loans. Not sure what my fiancee's loan totals are.

No rolling credit card debt.

I have no car loans. My fiancee has maybe $30k.


-Income-
My fiancee and I have a combined salary of $250k.
I also have an additional $20k-$30k in additional misc investment returns that's less stable than salary, (mostly from investment properties and poker).

-Expenses-
I have a mortgage on my primary residence that's $1800/month with property taxes escrowed in. With insurance, repairs, and other misc items, my monthly averages out to $2500 over the course of several years.

I have a mortgage on one of my investment properties that's $600/month.

My fiancee and I together have $700/month in school loans. Hers is $500/monthly with 6.8% rate, and mine is $200/month with 2% rate.

She has a $500/month car payment at 3% (4 more yrs left). I have an 8 yr old car that's paid off and hope to drive another 8 yrs. But I estimate my monthly cost on this car is $650 (gas, insurance, routine and nonroutine maintenance). Her car is new so less problems and free maintenance for the next couple of years.

Our food cost is around $1000/month. I know this is high, but we eat out a lot because we suck at cooking. Our excuse is we don't have time, but we're just lazy.

My monthly bills (water, gas, electric, phone, tv, internet, ...) comes out to $400. I take care of some of my parents' bills like tv, internet, and cell phone which is why it's higher.

I contribute $1000/month to a savings account for my parents. My dad is retired but my mom is still working. She makes very little in a nail salon and I told her I would replace her income there if she'd stop so she wouldn't have to breathe in those poisenous fumes. (Giving her money did not get her to stop but I now understand she does it more for the social interaction with the other girls.)

personalfinance,Bit miffed about retirement.,"Pertinent details: 

Single, no human dependents.

Renter, but if I had a down payment, I could easily afford a mortgage on my single income where I live.

No consumer debt (will be looking for another car in a couple years, though). 

Enough student loans to be on extended repayment--all eligible for PSLF--but in practice only one loan is eligible because your eligibility period starts when you start your eligible job. One loan (the smaller) is about 50% repaid. Other is at ~25% repaid. Both are flat rate: I'd pay more on income contingent. 

Potential to come into a small inheritance (sub 50k).

 
Gov't employee with pension. 401K not available, no matching on 457. 

Current retirement savings: negligible. For my first couple years out of school, I made very little and was paying ahead on loans, and did not contribute to a 401K. At a second job, contributed fully, but was laid off before fully invested. 

Have had a couple periods of significant unemployment. So while I'm trying to get back track with savings, there were also a *lot* of things that were put off for far too long (major dental/medical work, vet care for cat, car repairs, etc). Also slowly replacing things that have worn out (clothes, shoes, laptop, pots and pans, etc). I am of the mind that one buys quality, so larger up-front investment, but things last longer. 

So where this is all going: 

I'm a little miffed as to what to do about retirement. Should I roll that 401K into a private Roth IRA (can I do that?)? Do I want the 457, or the Roth? I could see myself maxing out a Roth, but not a 457 (I honestly don't see myself contributing much to a 457 for at least a year if I go with a Roth). If/when I get an inheritance, should I throw as much as I can into a Roth, and then other higher-yield savings, or should I pay off some student loans?",finance,1414437725
personalfinance,"Looking for advice on how to allocate my income wrt debt, retirement, and other savings","Sorry, this is a repost from last week, I only got 1 reply so am hoping for more. Thanks.

---

Hi, I am looking for the kind of advice that seems to be very common here. My finances are a little complicated so I will try to give as much info as necessary but please feel free to ask for more. 

I am married but my husband and I tend to keep our finances more separate than most couples. We are more comfortable with things this way and I don't have any complaints about it. Because of that I don't have all the details (exact numbers) about his accounts but I can get it if it's necessary to get advice here.

The broad strokes wrt my husband's finances:

* salaried at $115k
* usually gets 10% annual bonus
* also gets to buy company stock at a discount and sell it twice a year (usually nets $1k to $3k twice a year)
* is starting a small business and putting a lot of his income into that; no profits yet
* 401k with about $50k, company matches so he maxes out his contributions

My finances:

* salaried at $52,000/year takehome about $3500/month
* have a mandatory pension contribution of $310/month, currently about $5000 in pension contribution account
* $45k student loan debt (at 1-2% interest)
* daycare $950/month
* car insurance $50/month

I don't have any other bills I'm personally responsible for. My husband pays the rent (since he makes a little over 2x what I make, we figured it was just easier if I pay daycare and he pays rent -- also bc I have a dependent care FSA plan through my work). Our utilities are bundled into our rent, except cable which his work pays for bc he works from home. Our cars are paid off and I walk to work so we don't spend much on gas.

Food and other household stuff (cleaning supplies, toiletries, diapers) we pay for out of a joint account.

We also have an e-fund of about 6 months expenses liquid that my husband has set aside.

My financial goals:

1. Get a much better retirement account going. I don't 100% understand the pension and I think that unless I stay at this job for &gt;5 years then I don't actually get anything out of it, and I'm not sure I'll be there that long. I think I need to start a separate account, but I don't know what kind. My employer doesn't offer a 401k and our income is too high to get any benefit from a tax-deferred IRA. What kind of retirement account should I have and how many dollars should I be putting in it every month?

2. Pay off student loans. The interest rate is so low that this is actually not a huge priority for me but I guess the sooner it's gone the better.

3. Save up for a downpayment for a house. I think we will need $50,000 to $100,000 to put 10-20% down. We don't have a dedicated house savings fund right now.

4. Save up to be able to buy my next car outright instead of financing it. I have a 9 year old Mazda with 160,000 miles on it. I don't mind driving it until the wheels fall off but I will need another car some point in my life and it would be great to be able to buy it free and clear.

I broke my finger at the gym in mid 2010. Went to the urgent care, had insurance, and it was all fine an dandy. I received some letters in the mail about insurance wanting to discuss the circumstances of the care I received, but being in my very early twenties and focused on school, I didn't think much of it. I received a bill from the hospital, but I thought it was a mistake and assumed that the insurance would cover it. I never put two-and-two together until a couple of years later, when I was checking my credit score. I saw that I had a derogatory account. 

I contacted the collection agency that had owned my debt, and it turned out they had the wrong address, so they were sending the bill to an address that doesn't exist. I had them correct the address and told them I would pay as soon as I received a bill. Unfortunately, I never receive a bill, and I completely failed to follow up. It's something that's been on the back of my mind a lot lately, and it's causing me a lot of stress. The account is still marked as derogatory, and I'm not sure what my best course of action is. Can I file a dispute because the address was incorrect? Will that be enough to remove it from my record, or will it still remain there, harming my credit-worthiness? and if so, for how long?

**THE STORY:**  
Up until recently my financial life was not what I would call secure thanks to my career choice. I was always making money, I bought my house at 25 with a $20k down payment on $200k (using $9k from my RRSP's... Ugh...) but I bought in a nicer area with a longer mortgage thinking that having a roommate to reduce payments was a smart choice as opposed to renting for no possible equity gain/resale value. 

Went to University, then to a one-year grad school program out of town (thankfully I had the liquid cash due to using my RRSP's on the house), but I also kept the house (added a temporary additional roommate) and living in the new town without work for eight months decimated my savings. 

Now though my career has catapulted forward thanks to the school, I've moved back to my house, got a new job and now I'm in what I think is a comfortable place and looking ahead, and trying to decide what makes sense to grow. 


**MY QUESTIONS:**  
-Investing 101 please. I've read a little bit (I understand stocks, options, bonds, options, what a TFSA/mutual fund/RRSP is) but I have major paralysis when it comes to deciding/knowing what's the best move. Where should I be putting put my cash, and be putting my extra cash towards growth and retirement?

-I feel like my mortgage situation is terrible, but only from an ignorant point of view in that doing a 30 year mortgage PROBABLY wasn't smart? It COULD be paid down faster, but with the low mortgage rates, I think I could out-invest 2.59%? Or maybe that's backwards thinking... What can I/should I do here? I am willing to sell if this is more fiscally responsible.

-If you look at my expenses, obviously my bodybuilding oriented lifestyle is a major expense ($720 a month on groceries/supplements) but I'm thinking that lifestyle is one of my major ""luxuries"" that I enjoy. Other than that, are there any numbers that jump out as higher than expected?

personalfinance,Need guidance on paying off a credit card,"Friends, need some financial advice.

Maxed out a credit card. Was in the process of moving and hit some hard times and before I knew it the CC was at the max. Now I'm paying it back but with a monster interest rate. I tried to research some options but I'm so overwhelmed I don't know where to start. It was suggested to open a new credit card and transfer as much as the limit on the new CC would allow. To me this seems like I would just open another card and have to pay another bill.

I guess, where do I go from here, do I have options? If so, what are they? I'm not a financial wizard (obviously) but opening new cards to pay off existing ones doesn't make much sense to me.

Bitcoin,"LakeBTC to Add EUR, GBP Trading – CEO Thomas Xie Interview by AllcoinsNews","##allcoinsnews: My first question is about the history of LakeBTC. Who are the founders? You are in the Coinbase Big 4 index. What sort of volume do you do now in bitcoin (BTC)? How did you grow from the start? Have you raised venture capital?

Thomas Xie: LakeBTC was started in March 2013 as an exchange initially for a small group of traders and other financial professionals from investment banking and commercial banking sectors. These early users and investors helped shaped LakeBTC with their years of experience trading bonds, currencies, commodities, and all types of derivatives and structured products in financial markets.They know capital markets inside out, and they trade Bitcoins as a hobby, just like playing Texas hold’em. Later that year, we decided to incorporate and run the exchange under the current domain name. Naturally, our investors and many of the people we recruit have extensive financial experience, and this is one of the important differences than other players in the field. We are one of the big four bitcoin exchanges that determine CoinDesk BPI and a Gateway member of IRBA. We are also included in TeraExchange’s bitcoin index, which is the base of their US CFTC approved bitcoin swap, and our data is included in a number of leading bitcoin websites.

We are dedicated to building a fair Bitcoin platform with top security, excellent liquidity, and extraordinary customer service. As crypto currencies gained more and more exposures to the general public, LakeBTC is becoming a leading Bitcoin platform around the globe. Our years of risk management and internal control experience in financial industries build the most solid foundation for ensuring customers’ fund and privacy being safe and secure.

Additionally, creating a fair and efficient marketplace is also important to protect investors’ interests. We do everything in our power to minimize market manipulations and unfairness. Market surveillance programs, carefully designed products, comprehensive risk management, and strict internal controls are all meant to ensure this young and energetic market be fair and safe to every participant. At LakeBTC, users are best protected from financial predators, bitcoin theft, online fraud, market manipulators, trader errors, bot bugs, and flash crashes. We provide the same level of service to all users at all times. All users are treated with the same policy published on our website.

Trading volume really depends on the market conditions. It varies from a couple of thousand to over 10 thousand.

We have initial investors, but we have not raised any external funds yet. Some potential investors got in touch with us, and it’s ongoing.

##allcoinsnews: You exchange offers USD / BTC trading now. I know that you will offer EUR / BTC trading very soon. When will this happen? What other services or currencies will you support in the near future?
Thomas Xie: To better serve our customers’ needs, we are constantly looking for banking and payment processing partners around the world. We added Ripple network and EgoPay, and we became a Gateway Member of International Ripple Business Association.

To better serve our European customers, we are finalizing partnership details with our payment processing partner in Europe, and plan to launch the service later this year. EUR and GBP will be included in the first phase, and multiple payment methods including SEPA will be added. It’d be much easier for Europeans to make deposits and withdrawals to/from LakeBTC at a much lower cost. With LakeBTC’s outstanding security, great liquidity, and superb customer service, we expect to see a sizable BTC/EUR trading activities.

We are also working with partners in North America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America to introduce more local payment methods and streamline the deposit/withdrawal processes.

##allcoinsnews: How has the volatility of BTC affected your business planning?
Thomas Xie: Volatility definitely has an effect on market sentiment. Bitcoin is just a few years old, and this volatility is not surprising. As a matter of fact, when you look at the historical prices, what we see today is much smaller. On the bright side though, the volatility and the speculation help bitcoin stay on headline news and get more coverage from the media.

To any exchange, an effective market surveillance program is a critical component that ensures the fairness and smoothness of the marketplace. Unusual activities, abnormal positions, sudden price changes, and suspicious trades should raise alarms to exchange operators and if necessary, preventative actions should be taken quickly to mitigate the risk of price manipulations and human errors.

LakeBTC have a real time market surveillance program to monitor unusual trading activities and suspicious positions. By comparing with bitcoin index prices from other sources, we try to reduce the risk of market manipulations by individual attackers. This is especially important for a volatile market such as bitcoin. We shifted an enormous amount of effort into this, including market surveillance, limited orderbook, dark pool, product design, staff training and so on.

Other than that, we do plan to launch bitcoin derivatives such as futures to help miners, exchangers, merchants, and institutional investors to better manage their risks and exposures.

##allcoinsnews: Your exchange is in English, Swedish, and Chinese. What is your analysis of what countries your users are from?
Thomas Xie: We have users from all around the world, with a better concentration from Americas, Europe and southeast Asia.

As mentioned earlier, we are adding banking and payment processors all around the world. Besides, we are currently working on adding more languages as well to bring better experiences to non English speaking users.

We offer a comprehensive and secure REST and Websocket API, with sample codes in PHP, Ruby, Python, and a few other programming languages. Professional algorithm traders would find it extremely easy to integrate their trading bots to LakeBTC. Our website design is responsive, and works equally well on mobile devices so casual users may buy and sell bitcoins on their cell phones smoothly.

We just made a major change to our fee structures, with maker-taker introduced and a big promotion is going on right now. Users may enjoy a 0.05% or even free trading at LakeBTC. All of these strategies will further grow our user base globally.

##allcoinsnews: There have been some significant exchanges that have collapsed with hacking being an important factor (e.g. Mt Gox, Bitcoin Trader recently). How are you protecting your customers funds from this type of risk? In terms of wallets, what do you think is best solution for your customers?
Thomas Xie: The founder of Mt.Gox came from a technical background, but running a financial firm requires many years of risk management and internal control experience. That’s not something you can acquire overnight.

The safety of the wallet is indeed a huge challenge. Average users may choose and trust a professional bitcoin company such as LakeBTC, especially if it’s a lot of money. They should pick one who’s secure, legitimate, compliant, and well managed. Professional users who know what they are doing can manage their own wallets.

Security, liquidity and service are three strengths we have and security is number one. SSL encryption, cold storage, Google Authenticator, SMS confirmations, etc. are several technical measures we currently employ. But people have to realize that a Bitcoin exchange is not only a technology company, but more importantly, also a financial one.

If Facebook went under, it’s bad but people can live with it. Same thing for Amazon, Youtube, Uber and so on. But if your bank failed and all your savings vaporized? That’s horrifying.. A financial firm faces many security challenges that are unheard of typical technology companies. The technological security mechanisms mentioned above are certainly important, but what really matters to financial institutions are risk management and internal controls. Our team with years of experience in financial industries is working hard to ensure customers’ fund and privacy being safe and secure. For example, all withdrawals need to pass an automatic system checks for book balances, login history, trading patterns and so on, then passed to a two level manual approval process. If everything is good, the fund is transferred to the customer. We do everything in our power to minimize the risks of human errors, system bugs, and hacking activities. Incidents such as transaction malleability would not happen at LakeBTC.

##allcoinsnews: Many governments have concerns (e.g. China, USA, etc..) about crypto currencies. How will the Chinese cryptocurrency develop going forward?
Thomas Xie: First of all, we are a BVI company, with customer service and technical support in Shanghai. LakeBTC is a bitcoin exchange for the world. We pay attention to the government policies around the world and do our best to stay compliant. We believe this is to the best interest of all our users.

Chinese government clearly stated that bitcoin is not a currency and would not regulate it as a currency. Secondly, the policy is in fact quite easy on bitcoin participants. The latest official policy declared that people have the right to own, buy, and sell bitcoin. The major goal of the existing policies is to manage risk and stop market manipulation. Margin and shorting trading, futures, and many other high-leverage products (20 times or even higher) and price manipulation caused flash crashes early this year and that’s the target of the so-called ban. If the situation does not improve, we are not surprised to see the policy tightens further and the entire bitcoin ecosystem is jeopardized.

US is more complicated. Both federal and state regulators are involved. The most recent NY DFS proposal is not considered a positive sign. We are living in the new millennium now and they government agencies need to adapt to the digital age too. It’s impractical and cumbersome for every state plus Fed to come up with a regulation each separately. Bitcoin is an internet thing and there’s no state borderline on the internet after all.

personalfinance,(AU) Managing finances with an offset Mortgage,"My fiancee and I have bought our first house in the past 12 months and we got the mortgage option of an offset account to our Mortgage. This means that whatever the balance of this account, it is taken off the mortgage amount when interest is calculated. At the moment, we are putting all of our money into this account in an attempt to minimise our interest on our mortgage. 
I am finding it very difficult to keep track of our saving and expenditure with this method. Things like emergency funds, holiday savings, Wedding fund, money for future house modifications/repairs are hard to track when they are all in one pile of money. 

I am wondering if it would be worthwhile to split some of this into some other accounts verses losing the savings in interest repaid on the mortgage? Or if not, how best to manage my finances with and offset mortgage?

I envision this to be a little different than the famous Lazlo pizza purchase:

-  Denominated in Bits
-  Involving Multi-sig with a trusted third party
-  Including some item or items that just cannot be easily ordered by picking up the phone and ordering from Papa John’s, or using Fed Ex, Credit Cards, etc.

To execute this test of the bitcoin “peer-to-peer ad-hoc economy”, I envision the following:

1.  Two volunteers, one in San Francisco, another anywhere in the world to act as a trusted intermediary.

2.  We agree on the terms of the deal, and I fund the multi-sig address, coordinated by the intermediary.  (I don’t yet know how to do this, so I need some guidance.)

3.  The San Francisco volunteer builds a simple “care package” to include two Pizzas, a pack of Red Bulls (or other high energy  drink (Avitae Caffeinated Water?), and a “Good Luck” card  with a simple handwritten message to my son’s AngelHack team and another “Thank You” card to the AngelHack Organizers with a simple handwritten message.  Anything else included is a bonus (wrapping the box, including other items like Bitcoin cupcakes, or whatever.)

4.  Deliver the care package to the AngelHack San Francisco HQ (169 11th St.) for lunch this week before Thursday (ideally today).

5.  Funds will be released upon successful delivery, either by confirmation from my son that the Care Package was received (in which case I will release), or by photo of my son at AngelHack receiving the goods (funds then released by the intermediary; my son’s picture is on a link below).



If you are interested, please contact me, so we can negotiate the final terms of the deal.

personalfinance,Student loan holder ignoring request to apply payments to principal?,"I have contacted my lender multiple times and finally have gotten a response. I have asked them to apply payments which are above what it due to the principal to avoid paying excess interest. Perhaps I'm reading this completely wrong, but it sounds to me like they are just going to make me be 'paid ahead' and not actually apply it to the principal. Am I missing something? This is what they have said to me: 

&gt; Hi Technologian,
 
&gt;Thank you for your recent email.
 
&gt;If you make a payment that is more than the scheduled payment amount, the additional amount will be applied first to any remaining unpaid accrued interest, if any, and then to the principal balance. If an account has multiple loans, the additional amount is applied first to any remaining unpaid accrued interest and then to the principal balance of the unsubsidized loan with the highest interest rate. You can verify the amount of your payment applied to interest and principal by viewing your payment history at mygreatlakes.org.
 
&gt;Making higher or extra payments may result in your loan being “paid ahead.” This means you won’t be considered delinquent if you stop making payments until you are no longer paid ahead, but interest continues to accrue during this period. This does not mean that the payment is not applied to your account on the date it is made.
 
&gt;We hope this information is helpful. Please let us know if you have additional questions.",finance,1414504704

I have one month left on my lease then it rolls over to month-to-month. I opted for the two bedroom because at the time I could afford it easily and my SO and I had plans to move in together.

personalfinance,The Truth about Whole Life Insurance,"I have noticed some discussions in the past on /r/personalfinance about Whole Life Insurance.  I specialize in these products among other things, and my purpose today is to simply offer the truth about these products. My desire is to be as factual as possible in addressing the discrepancies surrounding this product.
  
Before I begin, I would like to point out that I am by no means opposed to investing in the market or Wall Street in general.   I will only use factual information as it pertains to a full disclosure of Whole Life Insurance.
 
To begin, it is readily apparent to most that Participating Dividend-Paying Permanent Life Insurance (I will refer to that entire title simply as “Whole Life” in the future due to convenience) is a highly misunderstood topic in the financial world today. There are a few clear misconceptions by most that I will address first.  I will then close by describing a true, properly designed Whole Life policy as simply and easily as possible. 

If one decides to go to a general agency and purchase a whole life policy without the proper guidance and information to effectively purchase whole life then the chances of purchasing an expensive and unattractive policy is very high.  I cannot stress enough that a properly designed Whole Life policy is vastly superior to a normal policy from a normal, unspecialized agent from a normal insurance company. 

The discrepancies surrounding whole life is due to two incorrect attributes. First and foremost, it is due to the Federal Trade Commission releasing over 30 years ago a deeply flawed study that grouped whole life with other products, including non-participating whole life and the now-defunct deposit term insurance, driving the return down to 2%. The study also failed to examine the track record of high-quality insurance companies. Unfortunately, the federal government has never repudiated the study, and this false premise has since been embedded into the financial mindset of today. Secondly, it is due to stories everyone has heard about someone’s financial well-being suffering from any number of defects found in an ill-designed policy sold by an incompetent agent. These folks, it seems, never bothered to go and check this out for themselves.  It is a good thing we have folks who have a passion for seeking out the truth on their beliefs or we would probably still be bleeding out sick patients in order to heal them. 

A properly designed whole life policy is only as good as the company who has issued it. One common attack on Whole Life that is being thrown around is that your money is at risk of the insurance company remaining solvent.  Actually, this is partially true. I encourage those reading to do a little research on companies like Ohio National (https://www.ohionational.com/portal/site/client/), Allianz (https://www.allianzlife.com/), and American Equity (http://www.american-equity.com/). These companies are just a few of the very old and very solid insurance companies that offer outstanding products and service. Their financial statements and customer reviews speak for themselves. I am not appointed nor do I write policies through companies with any less impressive features and neither would any other knowledgeable or professional agent. 
Furthermore, each state has a reservoir of insurance for the insurance companies if you will.  In other words, every state has a guarantee on the guarantees found within your whole life policy.  If the world economy was to distinguish overnight everyone who has a whole life policy is guaranteed at least more than half of their policies worth.  I am not aware of any state that guarantees less than roughly 85%. This guarantee of guarantees coupled with the financial fortitude of quality insurance companies speaks for itself in many ways.  

I do not mean to come across as arrogant or snobbish.  However, what I am relating is not of my opinion.  This information is readily available and I am more than willing to provide anyone who asks with further reading on the subject. 

In conclusion, I would like to express the “main Ingredients” so to speak of a properly designed whole life policy. My main point of emphasis is that the magic of whole life lies in a PARTICIPATING AND NON-DIRECT RECOGNITION insurance company. A genuine and properly designed whole life policy will provide all or some of the following: No risk, guarantees, no penalties (there are a few penalties worth noting however these penalties are incredibly rare), liquidity, use and control of your money, protection from creditors, leverage, tax deferred growth, tax free distributions, competitive and guaranteed rate of return, collateral, disability benefits (optional) until age 65, and a Death Benefit that will go to the heirs tax free.  Again, I would like to restate that a policy can truly provide all of these things if designed properly.

I'm in the process of increasing my contributions to my 401k. In the process of working out how much it will decrease my net pay per pay period I noticed something weird. I'm in the 25% federal tax bracket, but when I crunch the number it looks like im actually being taxed at 26.8%. Can anyone help me understand whats going on.

Here are the numbers:

Salary = 80k  

Total Gross Per Paycheck (bi-monthy) = $3333.33

Fed Taxable Gross (after pre-tax deductions) = $3197.81

Fed Withholding = 603.36

Fed MED/EE=48.30

Fed OASDI/EE=206.53

Total Fed taxes = 838.19

If I divide total Fed taxes by my total fed taxable gross its 26.8%. (838.19/3197.81=.268)

Any idea why its so much more than what I would expect with marginal tax rates? 

What am I missing here?",finance,1414532069

We are not suggesting or implying that anyone should buy, sell or hold AIG. We are merely supplying some investment notes I put together. Our internal notes are much more in depth and include various financial modeling.

I apologize for the disclaimer, but for compliance reasons I have included.

Please read disclaimer at bottom of this page.

October 28, 2014 (51.74) Notes 2Q14 as 3Q14 not yet released 

Our full notes can be found at this link: http://1drv.ms/1ry0DuR

AIG continues to improve their financial profile, and is making progress in returning to profitability of an industry standard. ROE is expected to be 6.50%, which is lower than I would like to see, but in light of the interest rate environment and discount to book value is totally acceptable. I would own this issue as long as Price to Book was at 1X. I could see owning this at a price to book of 1.5X, but that could be a long time away, and various scenarios could cause a sale prior to that if it ever occurred. Book value could grow at &gt; 10%. I expect that BVPS could be $80 at end of F2015. 

 AIG has a goal to return $25 - $30B in capital to shareholders during 2011 – 2015. Through 2013 ~$20B has been returned, of which about $15B has been done via share buybacks. Projected dividends are $0.50 for 2014, and $0.75 for 2015. If dividend stayed at $0.50, our thesis would remain unaffected. 

 The primary reasons for owning AIG is a quality organization being priced materially less than book value. From 1985 – 1996 AIG was priced between 1.5X to 2.5X BVPS. This increased to sometimes 3X BVPS from 1999 to 2002, and was typically at 1.5X to 2.5X from 2002 to 2008. P/BVPS was 47% in 2012, and 65% in F2014. I project BVPS of $75 in F2014, and $80 in F2015, which at the current price of $51.74 would be P/BVPS of 69% currently, and 65% in F2015. 

 Book Value per share excluding AOCI was $64.28 at F2013, and is projected by us to be $68 at F2014, and $71.50 at F2015. 

 Yield is 0.96% ($0.50). Earnings expected at $4.85 for 2014, which would give a P/E of 10.67X. Dividend payout has averaged &lt;10% for the last 25 years. Of course the ratio is distorted as 5 of the last 10 years had no payout or losses. The payout ratio was 0% in F2012, and 4% in F2013. Dividend payout ratio expected to be 10% and 10% for F2014 and F2015 respectively. Prior to 2006 ROE was typically greater than 10%. There was no ROE from 2008 – 2010, which coincided with the financial crisis, and AIG was one of the material culprits of that crisis. ROE is expected to be 6.50% for F2014 and 6.50% for F2015. Average P/E for the last 10 years has been inconsistent. Historically from 1980 – 1997 the average annual P/E was 12.68. From 1998 through 2002 the P/E was &gt;20. From 2003 till present, the P/E was between 8X (2012) and 29.9X (2011). Projected eps for F2015 is $4.95 which equates to a forward P/E of 10.45X. VL gives it ‘C++’ financial strength, and a Safety rating of 4. VL projects a price of $55 - $90 between 2017 – 2019 (8/15/14).

personalfinance,Student loans are weighing me down :( How can I stay motivated and stop obsessing?,"24/F, currently working to pay off $44k in student loan debt (gov't debt, was originally 57k). I work full time at an architecture firm and just got a raise of $2/hr (so I'm at $21/hr now) which allowed me to quit my second part-time job that eclipsed all of my free time on the weekends. I would have kept working the part time job but after 8+ months of 55+ hour work weeks and no vacation time, my sanity was wearing thin.

I force myself to pay a minimum of $1100/month to my loans. $280 of that is the required payments, and the rest goes to the loan with the highest interest rate. Even with my recent raise this is still about 45% of my income.

I pay any extra money I have to my loans. I've got an emergency fund (my car will probably fail soon), a small stock portfolio and a couple of Roth retirement accounts which I no longer contribute to. At my current rate, I should be debt free by July 2018, maybe even  sooner with raises/tax returns/holiday bonuses, etc... 

And yet I still feel really crappy. My thoughts alternate between ""I'm not making enough/putting enough towards my loans"" to ""I'm focusing too much on my loans and not enjoying life"". I obsessively read this sub and r/financialindependence, check all my accounts/mint daily, and do everything I'm supposed to do financially.

The lowest the 30 yr mortgage rate got to in the US was only down to about 3.25% and everyone was mentioning how ""rates"" are near zero.

I think ""rates"" is some rate controlled by the Fed.  From what I've read, I think the 30 yr mortgage rate depends heavily on the yield of the 10 yr treasury.  This yield appears to have only hit a low of a little below 2% (in 2012).

(1) If a near zero ""rate"" in the US results in a ~3% 30 yr mortgage rate, how did Japan's mortgage rate get so low?

(2) Is it possible for the US 30 yr mortgage rate to go as low as Japan's? What would need to happen for this to occur? 10 yr US treasury down to near 0%?

personalfinance,Should I move my Credit Card balance to Student Loans?,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I am relatively new to the personal finance scene. I have just started working on tackling my debt and responsible budgeting. I have spent the last week or so scouring this subreddit and additional resources and it has helped quite a bit in determining my best plan of action. Forgive me if this has been assessed previously; I was unable to find a thread assessing similar circumstances as mine. 

About me: 24, recently divorced, currently living with parents. I hold just under $10,000 in credit card debt (from wedding expenses... that's a mistake I only needed to make once) at 10.9%, in addition to ~$15k in federal student loan debt at varying rates from 3.8%-6.8%. 

Following the divorce and having time to refocus my priorities, I am returning to an idea I had before, which is enrolling in a Master's in Teaching program. I am applying to begin next Summer. My areas of work experience include childcare and marketing, which, after two years, I decided was not for me. I am doing childcare in the meantime. Getting this degree will greatly increase my earning potential and career opportunities, for a cost of less than my first year’s salary. Depending on which program I go with, I will need to take $38k-$43k additional student loan debt, which is an amount I am only willing to take because they will be federal student loans with more generous payoff schedules and plans. 

My question is this: is it wise to convert my Credit Card debt into student loan debt when I do this program? This debt would be repaid at either 4.7% (Stafford) or $7.4% (PLUS) interest, which is much better than the current 10.9%. I currently pay $300/mo. on the credit card which is due to be paid off at the current rate in 3.5 years. I realize that were I to stretch the payment out on my student loans it could cost me more in interest than the current plan, so I will be continuing to pay $300/mo. ($400/mo. total after this payment is added to my current loan payment) towards (Credit Card-turned-)student loans. This would allow me to pay off the equivalent credit card balance 3 months sooner, which is significant to me. One thing to keep in mind is that I will be upping the payment to at least $600/mo. after finishing my program, so the potential savings in pay-off grow more significant as more of this goes towards principal. Another thing to keep in mind is that during my program I am unable to work because it is very time intensive. This means that I will need to continue to make credit card payments through this time, which would have to come from student loans. So, at a minimum, I will be essentially “funneling” $3600 (less interest) from the credit card to the student loan across this 14-month period anyways.

Should I just take a chunk of $10k up front and payoff the credit card, then just stick diligently to the increased payback? 

It’s also worth noting that I am unable to get a balance transfer card that would serve this purpose because I will not qualify for a large enough credit limit due to earnings cuts both from my divorce and also to my personal income.

Am I missing anything here?",finance,1414557080
personalfinance,I'm interested in online banking. Which one is right for me?,"I am currently with BofA. Recently though, I've just grown tired of them and am looking for something a little more innovative. That's when I was introduced to the wonderful world of online banking. It seems like it would be a perfect fit for me. No fees, no hassles for the most part, and very easy to use with the mobile apps. I just have no use for physical banks anymore since I have direct deposit and use my tips as my spending money. And even then, most of the online banks I've read about reimburse for ATM fees which is awesome! So I guess my main focuses on which one to choose is one with no fees, a good interest rate, a good mobile app, and free atm usage, or at least being reimbursed for it. Also, if any of them has an easy feature for transferring money to others, even if they are at another bank, that would be a huge plus. Who should I be looking at?

EDIT: Just wanted to add a little more info. I'm not looking for all the fancy stuff like no international fees or stuff like that. Just something simple for day to day checking purposes. I'm not totally sure I even need a savings account since I have a 401k. But who knows, it might be useful.",finance,1414558019

I graduated 3 years ago, and currently have 2 more years of residency to finish. I then have two more additional years of fellowship to do. In totality, I will have done about 6-7 years of Income Based Repayment. At the moment, I am at 390K in loans with 7.7% interest. 

I have heard new news that they are planning to cap PSLF amount to 58,000$. Regardless if I do pursue a career (probably long term as I also want to teach) in medical academia at a public institution, I can probably have the total loan amount forgiven with a hefty tax at the end of the 10 year period.

The question is the contingency plan: If the PSLF is capped at 58000, meaning the federal government proceeds to go through with this, then the question is, how can I tackle a loan amount?

These are federal loans for Dental School that used to be through Direct Loans, but are now serviced through Nelnet.  I have 8 loan groups (A through H), that vary in amount from around $1,000 to around $40,000 in a group.  All of the interest rates are at about 7.65% right now.

I was told to beware of consolidation, because I will no longer be able to pay off an individual loan group in order to lessen my monthly payment over time.  In other words, once I consolidate, all of the groups will be rolled into one.  This will have the advantage of a lower interest rate, but the disadvantage will be that the monthly payment will stay the same until the entire debt is paid off.

personalfinance,"Just a small town girl, living in a confusing world... I need help with a strategy for savings.","Background info: 

Just started working in July (graduated college in May). I'm 22 years old, and I'm living in a small city. Rent is high here, but everything else is inexpensive. Salary $75k/year. I have no student loans or debt of any kind, and I have a 6-month emergency fund.

I get paid semi-monthly (before any deductions, that paycheck is $3125, so $6250/month). My monthly expenses add up to around $1800.

I want to retire early. Nothing drastic like age 30 (although that'd be awesome), but I definitely don't want to be working full time into my 50s and 60s. I know that this is totally possible within my personal definitions of success, happiness, and frugality.

I've been researching a lot about personal finance lately, but I'm still new to this, so forgive me if some of my concerns would fit better in a Moronic Monday thread!

---------------------------------

I'm working for a really really really big corporation, and they offer a traditional 401(k) through Aon Hewitt. The company won't start matching funds until I've been here for a full year (then they'll match 6%), and then their matching funds aren't fully vested until I've worked here for 5 years.

Here's my situation/confusion...

I don't plan on working here for more than 1.5 or 2 years, for many reasons that aren't really relevant to this discussion.

I want to take full advantage of the 401(k) that's offered, but I find it rather annoying that I can't access it without penalty until I'm 59 years old. I plan to start investing elsewhere in addition to the 401(k) once I have a sizeable chunk of money set aside with which to do so(probably ~$10k, and probably Vanguard).

I'm in the 25% federal income tax bracket. I live in Texas, so there is no state income tax (woohoo!).

What would be a good percentage of my income to put into the 401(k) right now? The company won't match until July 2015, but I like the advantage of taking money out before taxes. If I put 20% of each paycheck into the 401(k) vs. only 10%, I can save about $160 per month in taxes alone.

At the same time, I also want to be getting the most out of my income/investments in a way that I can access the money before I'm 59.

When I do leave this company, what will happen with my existing 401(k) money? I know there is a roll-over process, but I'm not really sure how it works. Is it taxed? Can I roll-over into an IRA as opposed to a 401(k)? What is the difference?

--------------------------------------

TL;DR... I'm making more money than I know what to do with. (*That came out a lot douchey-er than intended... sorry.*) I'm hoping to retire relatively early and I'm looking for the best strategy for saving and investing that will help me do so.",finance,1414595415

I'm a 22 y/o living in Silicon Valley with no debt to my name.

I'm looking for advice on whether it's the right time to start looking at building equity instead of renting an apartment. Here's the situation:

I currently pay $1850/mo for a 1-bedroom apartment in the bay area (this is actually cheap around here...). I've managed to save up around $50K total between maxing out my Roth IRA, putting away money into a personal Brokerage account, and an emergency fund etc. into a standard Checking account.

Do I keep renting an apartment until i've got 20% down on a decent house? Do I look elsewhere and commute 1-2hrs to work every day in order to find a cheaper home that I can buy relatively soon? Close relatives seem to all have something different to say and I'm looking for an outside opinion.

personalfinance,How are we doing? Need some general and retirement advice.,"Hi, r/personalfinance,


First post here, fist post on reddit ever. Long time lurker, I’ve learned a lot through this sub, but I’m looking to learn more.


I’m looking for some guidance and general advice regarding my finances and savings. Here are the basics:


Me: 29 year old employed full time making $81,505 a year. I got a raise today to $90,312 a year. My job is 100% secure. I’ve been there for 5 years and have enough seniority to avoid layoffs should they happen. Due to a union contract, they must layoff in order of reverse seniority, the newest workers would go first.
Wife: 29 year old employed full time making $45,000 a year


This results in me bringing home approximately $3,600 per month and my wife bringing home $2,800 per month for a total take home pay of about $6,400 per month. Her employment is relatively secure. My brother has worked for the company for 10 years and has never seen anyone laid off. I know that’s no guarantee, but I feel good about her chances.
This job is new for my wife, she just started within the last month. Prior to this she was a domestic worker in the area which resulted in decent, if unreliable income. This job pays better and has benefits.


I’m unsure what my take home pay will look like beginning with my next check in a couple weeks due to my raise, I’m assuming it’ll be a couple hundred more per month which I intend on putting into my 457(b) plan.


$12,000 emergency fund, a little low right now because we just made a down payment on our condo.


$12,000 in 457(b) retirement plan


We have no children and are not planning on any. While it’s not out of the question, the wife has an IUD now which 
greatly reduces the chances of an accident.


We live in Chicago. We like it here, relocating isn’t an option because we don’t want it to be. In spite of it being a high cost of living city, we do pretty well. We only own 1 car (2005 Honda) that’s paid off, she takes public transit to work, I commute about 40 miles round trip, but due to my schedule it’s only 2 or 3 times a week. We’ve only put around 5,000 miles on the car in the last year. It sometimes sits unused for weeks when I’m off of work because we both ride our bikes everywhere (other than work) whenever possible.


Current monthly expenses:
Mortgage (4.5% interest) - $2,000/month. This includes principal, interest, insurance, HOA fees. HOA includes water/sewage. We purchased this condo about a month ago.
Electric - $40
Gas - $60
Cell phones - $160
Food for me at work - $175 (I work 10 shifts per month, meals cost $15 per day, we do our own cooking at work. There’s also a mandatory $15 per month “house fund” to buy things that everyone at the firehouse uses like coffee, peanut butter, condiments, etc. These are contractual requirements, so although I’m not forced to eat with the crew everyday, because it’s in our contract this amount is tax deductible.)
Food for home - $600. Wife brings her lunch to work everyday, this adds to this expense, obviously takes away from the eating out expense.
Wife’s student loans - (4.875% interest) $500 ($37,545 remaining balance)
$70 - total for both of our gym memberships. Our food and gym memberships are a bit high because we eat very well at home. We rarely eat out, we exercise a lot, health is very important to both of us.
$250 - Medical expenses for my wife. This may change soon due to her starting on her new insurance. Not totally sure what the cost will be going foreword, but this is the maximum we’d pay.
Fuel for car - $120 per month (Car is paid off, has 130,000 miles on it, I do a bulk of the maintenance on my own. Just did a complete brake job for under $500)
Car insurance - $79 (paid every 6 months in $471.50 installments, get an extra discount this way)
Internet - $51
Netflix - $8
Entertainment and eating out - $75ish. Wife doesn’t drink, I drink rarely, we cook at home 99% of the time. We do enjoy the occasional meal out, but not often. We went out last night for the first time in a month and spent $45 for the two of us.
Wife’s transportation - $140 (90 for the CTA, $50 for a company shuttle)


Total: $4,320
Left over: $2,080



Credit card - We typically put around $2000 a month on our most used credit card. That’s mostly from the above expenses. In order to maximize cash back we put everything we can onto the card. We pay it off in full every month and have never carried a balance. We use a cash back card and have benefited pretty nicely from it. We also have around a $1,500 balance on a 0% interest card that we purchased our computer on. The 0% offer lasts until 06/2015 and we will have it paid off before then. We pay around $250 a month toward this card right now.


Our expenses have been a bit higher than normal over the last month due to buying some new things for the new house. Nothing big, just some new sheets, a bookshelf, a rug, etc.


As far as where the rest of the money goes:
457(b) - Similar to 401k, except for public employees. I’m contributing $400 per check or $10,400 per year (26 pay periods.) Now that my wife has a new and better paying job, I plan on upping this to the maximum contribution. I will up it again on January 1st when the new contribution limits take effect. There are no matching contributions to a 457b as I’m eligible for a public pension.


Each of my checks has 9.45% withheld for my pension. It’s a defined benefit pension system. I have to be 50 years old and have a minimum 20 years service to begin collecting at 50% of my last year’s salary. If I stay 30 years, it’s a maximum 75% salary. I have room to grow at work and am working on my education in order to increase my chances of getting a promotion in the future.
I’m not counting on the pension being there in the future, at least in that form. I certainly hope that it will be, but being that we live in Illinois, nothing is guaranteed as far as pensions go. That’s why I’m trying to put as much as possible in my 457b plan so that in the even that my pension completely goes away, I’ll have something to fall back on.


My wife has a profit sharing plan through her company. They contribute around 12% of an individual employee’s pay into an account for them. The account is invested and managed through the company. The employee has no say in the investments or allocations. However, this is at no expense to the employee. She pays nothing for this benefit. This plan is 20% vested after a year, 40% after 2 years, etc…and 100% vested after 5 years. She plans on staying with the company at least that long as they will pay for her masters degree. Because her company offers the profit sharing option, they do not offer any 401k or IRA options. She doesn’t plan on starting school until I’m done with school in about a year and a half. Her current plan is to get her degree in marketing. Our city has a relatively large number of marketing firms that pay very well.


I was putting $1,500 per year into a flex spending account as my health coverage through my employer was a higher deductible plan. I will no longer do this, we are going on my wife’s insurance as her’s has comparable coverage to mine but only has a $350 deductible per person.


Here’s where things get complicated.


We’re putting an additional $1,100 per month on the credit card to pay for school for me. I have an associates degree. My employer offers tuition reimbursement toward a bachelors degree. I’m taking advantage of this because, free education. The only issue is that we have to pay for it up front and get reimbursed at the end of each semester. I’m in my first semester right now and am paying approximately $4,500 per semester. I have not been reimbursed yet as the semester isn’t over. This doesn’t really create a problem, but I’m essentially looking at it as $5,000 not existing for the next year and a half as it will continually be spent then reimbursed. Employer doesn’t pay for books, but I’ve been able to find most of my textbooks on Amazon for under $10 used.


We own an investment property. It’s a townhouse that we were renting to a nice family. They are now getting a divorce, are breaking the lease, and are moving out in the middle of November. I’m keeping their security deposit as they broke the lease, but there will be expenses associated with this process. I’m working on finding another renter, but it’s not easy this time of year. Therefore, I need to be prepared to pay the approximately $1,400 in monthly expenses out of my own pocket. Some of this will come back to me at tax time, but for now, I may end up going out of pocket for an unknown amount of time. Thus far the rent has covered all expenses associated with the investment property. Due to the tax situation this puts me in, I show a rental loss every year. This is fine with me as I don’t really lose any money but I get a lot back from the IRS because they take depreciation into account.


So that was long-winded. I apologize. Now what I’m looking for is some advice.

I want to retire at age 50. This would allow me to retire with 68% of my salary through my pension. If the pension system stays in its current form I’d receive a 3% annual COLA. I could stay until age 54 to get the full 75%, but I don’t really want to. I love my job, but I’d rather retire if I’m able to. I don’t have a problem staying longer, but 54 is the latest I’d stay.


I want to have both my properties paid off by the time I retire. This gives me about 20 years to accomplish both. I feel that with the money my wife and I bring home, this is doable. I’m not as concerned with paying off the rental property as it’s more or less self-sufficient. However, retiring at age 50 with zero debt sounds like one hell of a good deal to me.


So my question is, how the hell do I pull this off?
1. Am I stupid for maxing out my 457b and not having any kind of an IRA?
With our withholding and the rental property, we usually bring in close to a $10,000 tax refund. I’m not interested in changing this, I’d rather have a large refund. The amount of interest I lose on this is worth not having the hassle of trying to save it on my own. Would I be better off taking this and putting half in a Roth IRA for me and half in a Roth IRA for my wife? We’d certainly have the money to max them both out as well.


I feel like Roth would be best for us as my 457b and pension are both taxable. My wife’s profit sharing is taxable too. Might be nice to have some post-tax retirement income as well.


2. Or should I take the tax refund and put at least a portion of it toward the mortgage? We’re planning on making at least 1 extra mortgage payment per year, we’d like to make 2 or 3, but we’re not sure if we’ll be able to pull that off yet. Would it be smart to throw some of the tax refund at it and not worry about it the rest of the year?


3. Should we take our extra money that we’ll have leftover every month and put it toward my wife’s student loans? Or would we be better off continuing the $500 per month payment and putting that money into an IRA, some other retirement vehicle, or toward the mortgage? The mortgage rate and her student loan interest rate are very similar (4.5% vs 4.875.)


4. What’s our best course of action? I know I’d feel great about getting my wife’s loans paid off as soon as possible, so should that be our first priority after building our emergency fund back up a bit? I’d like to have around $20,000 in there at all times.


5. Are there any other retirement options that I’m missing that I should be investigating? I went to see a financial planner but he was unhelpful to say the least. He tried to sell me permanent life insurance. That doesn’t seem like the best option for me, but I’m not totally sure.


6. Because neither of us has a matching option for 401k or 457b plans, is there any disadvantage to me maxing out my 457b? Is this money better utilized elsewhere? I got around 13% return last year on the money. I know everyone had a good year, but it seems like a good place to have my money.


I feel like we have things in relatively good shape. We make good money, we control our expenses well, we have no credit card debt, we have savings, and we’re saving aggressively for retirement, all before the age of 30. What can we do to improve? How can we make the most of our money and achieve our goal of retiring early and comfortably?


Sorry again for the long post, I wanted to include as much detail and information as possible so as to get the most information that I can from everyone here. Thanks a lot, r/personalfinance! Can’t wait to hear what you have to say!

personalfinance,Tax strategy for 3-fund portfolio in taxable account - fund selection questions,"A bit about myself, I am a STEM Ph.D. student several years from graduating. I have no debt and plenty of savings in addition to the investments discussed here. I don’t have any tax-advantaged opportunities right now, but I will start a maxed-out Roth IRA next year. I’m looking at some advice about my taxable investments.

TL;DR: Making a taxable investment allocation with 3 funds (US stock, international stock, bonds), want to optimize the plan a bit for taxes, have some funds picked out, looking for advice.

I am restructuring my taxable investments, currently about $20000 and contributing $500/month. I had been using a “get-started” online brokerage, but now that I have a large enough portfolio, I am switching over to a Vanguard account to avoid fees (I’d been paying $4 each time to contribute $500 to only one fund; this constrains me from paying into multiple funds at once) and get lower expense ratios. 

I am in a low-tax situation; I will pay 0% long-term federal capital gains and the lowest rate in my state, and I don’t have much capital gains anyway (a few thousand dollars). As an aside, I’ll be holding onto what I’ve bought in the last year, VV (large-cap ETF, Vanguard) until it’s been a year (I’ll have the same tax situation). Anyway, I believe I will save the amount paid in state taxes with the reduced expense ratios and fees in just a couple years.

Some of this is saving for “moderate term” use after maybe 10+ years. Things like a wedding, house, child expenses. Otherwise, it is starting on retirement savings. I don’t have an exact fraction in mind (I’m not sure about what I’ll require mid-life yet, so I’m just trying to build something up now to give me options), but 50% or more is for retirement.

My current retirement savings would be 90/10 stocks/bonds to mirror a far-out target date fund (VFFVX target 2055). The shorter-term things need more bond allocation. I think an overall 70/30 allocation is what I will do for this. 

Question 1:  How’s this sounding so far, especially the allocation?

I want to set up the likes of a “three fund portfolio” or something similar-looking to the Vanguard LifeStrategy funds (VASGX, VSMGX). I prefer getting a few funds myself, rather than a “fund of funds” like LifeStrategy.  Once I have some Admiral shares (funds &gt; $10000), the total expense ratio is lower; I can get more experience/intuition about rebalancing by doing it myself; and I will have more control over the allocation (and what parts I liquidate) when I need to move things around for a house down payment or whatever.

Those LifeStrategy funds actually have four funds; the fourth one is an international bonds fund (VTIBX), but with an allocation ~ 6%, I’d need a much larger portfolio (&gt; $50000) to get past the $3000 minimum, so I’ll stick with one bond fund for now.

Since this is a taxable account, I want to pay attention to the tax implications down the line. Right now I’m in the lowest tax bracket, but in several years, I hope not to be. Here is a discussion of the three other funds from LifeStrategy and what I’m planning to do. The allocations are between the 60/40 and 80/20 LifeStrategy funds, with all the bonds lumped together.

U.S. Stock:  VTSMX (total stock market) looks pretty tax-efficient, and I will make my portfolio large enough to just have admiral shares in this (expense ratio 0.05% instead of 0.17%). If there’s a tax managed version of this that may do better, I’d love to hear about it! 49% allocation.

International Stock:  VGTSX (international stock market) is said to be less tax-efficient. Expense ratio 0.22% for now, 0.14% admiral shares (reachable in several years). There has been a recent change about this, but Vanguard puts out tax-managed international stock funds (see http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-managed_fund_comparison#Total_international). So I was thinking I would go for VDVIX (non-U.S. developed markets). Expense ratio 0.20% now, 0.09% admiral. According to the link, it isn’t exactly the same coverage as VGTSX, but I don’t think I’m too worried about that right now. Looking at the prospectuses from VGTSX and VDVIX, the tax pains [(Return Before Taxes) - (Return After Taxes on Distributions)] are better by roughly 0.2% on VDVIX. That’s good, since it’s supposed to be tax managed. And since that’s comparable to the expense ratio, I think it’s worth paying attention to! So I’m thinking of going for VDVIX, 21% allocation.

Bonds:  VTBIX (total bond fund II) is for funds-of-funds only; it’s basically VBMFX (total bond fund). Expense ratio 0.20% now, 0.08% admiral (reachable in a couple years). I was thinking I might also like something tax managed for this; I’m guessing a lot of people put them in tax advantaged accounts and don’t care. I also want something “intermediate term” or so to go with my timeline. I didn’t see too many options in tax managed bond funds. The relevant one seems to be VWITX (intermediate-term tax-exempt fund). Expense ratio 0.20% now, 0.12% admiral. It’s in municipal bonds, rather than U.S. and corporate bonds (VTBIX). The average durations are both about 5 years. For VWITX, “Return After Taxes on Distributions” is the same as “Return Before Taxes;” for VTBIX, the taxes knock down the the return by about 1%-1.5%. That’s an even bigger difference! That would be VWITX, 30% allocation.

Question 2:  Am I on the right track with these fund selections? Any insight to share with me?

personalfinance,Is student debt really worth it?,"I am a 23 year old Irish male and have had the good fortune of completing my Bachelors degree without student debt. Because I come from low-income family, the Irish government paid for my tuition fees and awarded me a maintenance grant for my four year stint. The area of work in which I want to pursue (Neuroscience) requires at least a masters for a candidate to be even considered for any position. Here is where I move on to my predicament.

I have been looking at two year research-masters in the Netherlands and have been accepted into a programme due to begin in February. It isn't necessarily cheap to study in the Netherlands. My projected costs over the two years are in the range of 22,000 - 24,000 euros. I plan to have about 4,000 euro saved from working by the beginning of February and I also took out a loan of 10,000 euro in August. This loan is a 'preferred faculty' loan, which is interest free for the first five years and I have to option to begin repayments  anytime within the next five years. I plan to take out another post-graduate loan of about 10,000 euro next year which offers a low interest rate (4.5%) and the first payment for this loan can be differed for the first 12 months. The thing is a similar masters is offered in Germany, due to start September 2015. Germany offer free fees and a possible grant of 750 euro a month, based on my proposal, to aid me in my research. I would walk away relatively debt free if I attend the German university. I am not entitled to any financial assistance from the Dutch government. The thing is, the Dutch degree is perfectly tailored to my projected career path while the German degree is broader but on a similar path. Also I have the urge to go back into education. A lot can happen in 10 months and I have the fear that if I don't take this opportunity, I may regret it.

I would hope to pursue a Ph.D after this masters and I want to go down the road of academia, so I won't be earning money for a long, long time. From reading this sub frequently, I see one of the main problems people have is student debt. It really seems to cause a lot of anxiety and place a huge burden on people from day one of their careers. Can anyone tell me if it's really worth it to pursue the masters of my dreams when I could do a similar one that will leave me relatively debt free? How did some of you manage with your student debts and was it worth it?

Apologies for the grammar, I'm on my phone.

Edit: At the moment I'm in a low paying job. While it isn't an awful job, it's not something I want to be doing for a long period of time. 95% of students who complete the research-masters go into a Ph.d afterwards, which pay anywhere from 17,000 - 25,000 euro p/a.

personalfinance,BOA sold my account. How can I remove myself from BOA entirely without affecting my credit score?,"My checking account and all of my assets within it were unknowingly transferred to a new bank after the purchase of a single location of BOA by an outside bank. 

I was not sufficiently notified of this transaction and did not gain understanding until trying to withdraw cash from a BOA atm and received account error. I found that my account was sold, with the BOA office location to a smaller regional bank. I would have immediately opted out from joining the First Bank of Bumfuck nowhere, had I known this transaction was happening. I moved from this general location in Summer 2014 and opened a credit card with BOA and updated my location to my new residency. I had opened the initial checking account years prior in an entirely different state/location and relied on BOA since I travel frequently and BOA generally has locations across the US. I was informed that despite the fact that BOA is a national, widespread bank, each account is owned by one branch and therefore transitioned with it when sold. In the transaction among the two banks, Bank of America retained my credit card account, but sold my checking account as their representative failed to change the associated address when I updated my information, only tying the new credit card to this address.  Now, I no longer have the convenience of managing checking/credit accounts with 1 bank and my assets are hundreds of physical miles from my home. I do not believe I was provided amble notification to avoid this. Having no agreement or response on my end, yet transferring what could have been my lone source of money to a new bank seems like a god-awful policy on BOA’s end. I was able to track down two ‘Welcome to your new account’ emails from the First Bank of Bumfuck nowhere in my promotions email section, but would have likely disregarded them as spam since I had no knowledge of their institution or BOA’s agreement to sell my account. Although I have been enrolled in ebanking, which I thought eliminated paper statements, BOA claims that my notification must have been sent to my old address. I did not opt out during the given timeframe and therefore my account was moved. From my perspective, their representatives failed to input my change of address in a face-to-face meeting, having only used this as my credit card address and ignored my checking account. I can’t quite understand their logic here. As a young and single individual with no co-signed accounts, why would I maintain two separate addresses? I do not feel I was duly noted of this change. I am extremely dissatisfied with their customer service and business practices and I would like to leave their bank altogether. 

**Will cancelling my newly opened card, even with regular payments and zero balance leave me with negative credit report feedback as my average age of accounts will have one account with an age of 2 months, for the next n years? I have one other credit card, and would like to maintain 2 for a variety of reasons. This would require me to have another credit check done (knocking my score down a few points from my understanding). Then signing up for a new account, after having just opened a new credit card in August, I also anticipated would lower my credit score, since a flurry of newly opened credit cards traditionally represents a risky individual on their end.** When speaking to 2 of BOA customer service reps with input from their direct manager, they assured me that I had nothing to worry about since I had paid my balance in full each month, even as I detailed each of the circumstances above. This answer, coming from their credit card division shocked me the most. I was baffled that I received a ‘yeah that’s what me and my manager think’ when asking about something I would have expected to have more concrete answers to. I also asked about the cash rewards I had accumulated over the last few months and what the status was on receiving those rewards, as I no longer have a checking account with BOA, thanks to their efforts. I was told I would lose these rewards when cancelling my credit card and it is my understanding that if I’d like to keep those rewards…I have to open a new checking account with BOA!

All in all, I’d never like to deal with Bank of America, or their extremely incompetent employees ever again in my life. It seems like a widespread incompetence, starting the branch rep I met to issue me a credit card, that failed to update my address across the entirety of my account. This continued to the customer service reps I spoke with on the phone that answered my questions using their own thoughts and life experiences, without any concept of precedence from the company they work for. Not a lot of brain activity shared among that group, I’ll tell ya.

My goals are to get my damn money back, avoid taking hits to my credit score, separate entirely and wish everyone at Bank of America a short and miserable life. My long-term goals include purchasing an owner occupied investment property and from my research, I need a credit score around 730 to receive the minimum loan interest rates.

personalfinance,Does making extra payments on an amortizing loan actually net you more than the interest rate?,"I've been trying to find an efficient way to ask this question, so please bear with me.  People often say that making extra payments on a 5% loan is equivalent to making an investment and getting a guaranteed 5% return.  (So if you think investment X can make a better than 5% rate of return, you should make investment X instead of paying down a 5% loan faster.)  BUT on an amortizing loan like a 30-year home mortgage, making extra payments in the first few years significantly reduces your total interest payment because of how front-loaded the amortization schedule is.

So my question is: will I make/save more than a 5% return if I make extra payments for say the first five years of a 30-year, 5% mortgage?  If so, how could I calculate the equivalent rate of return I'd be earning?

Bitcoin,Effects of regulation and some observations (warning: long),"The stiff regulatory headwind which manifestated itself in the [SEC investigation letters](https://coinfire.cf/2014/10/27/sec-begins-sending-investigation-letters/) and FinCEN guidelines [FIN-2013-G001](http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html) (published in March 2013) followed by this weeks Rulings [FIN-2014-R011](http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/rulings/html/FIN-2014-R011.html) and [FIN-2014-R012](http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/rulings/html/FIN-2014-R012.html) make it obvious that Bitcoin is fundamentally incompatible with the current financial system at large. It is clear now that FinCEN regards any business which engages in Bitcoin as a money services business (MSB), which means that such business will have to implement an elaborate anti-money laundering program and comply with recordkeeping, reporting and transaction monitoring requirements as set forth by FinCEN^[1].

In and of itself, these rulings cannot come as a surprise as it is extending existing legislation to the Bitcoin domain and treats bitcoin as just another asset which can be used to transfer value between entities. In the narrow view of the FinCEN, any value transferred has to use the closed circuit of the current financial system and must play by its rules, and Bitcoin can be no exception.

For Bitcoin to remain viable as a payment option, Bitcoin payment processors such as Bitpay and Vaurum have now started to [spend money on compliance] (http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141028005244/en/Arthur-Levitt-Advises-Bitcoin-Companies-BitPay-Vaurum#.VFENYZOUc1g) - money that will have to be recouped by only small margins on processed bitcoin payments. Current volumes in bitcoin payments likely don't justify these costs, so investing money in compliance therefore speculates on the viability and growth of Bitcoin as a payments system within the USA in the future.

Bitcoin is by design able to operate outside of the current financial system as a fully automated, frictionless and efficient payment system. The FinCEN rulings state that companies engaging in Bitcoin are unsurprisingly subject to existing regulations - and compliance incurs cost and removes at least some of the efficiencies which Bitcoin enjoyed over traditional payment systems. Bitcoin is no longer frictionless - processing bitcoin payments now incurs significant upfront and ongoing costs. Needless to say, this will hurt - perhaps even reverse - its adoption.

Let's speculate a bit on what this might mean for the near and long-term future. It is save to say that a lot will depend on whether payment processors and exchanges will have the resources to survive, comply to MSB regulations and recoup the investments. If so, Bitcoin will likely continue to be gradually adopted by more and more businesses. If not, and if for instance BitPay and other payment processors throw the towel, this would largely reverse merchant adoption and pushes Bitcoin outside the existing closed, legal financial circuit. The third option would be ""neither of the above"" - new legislation might create exemptions for Bitcoin, for instance.

The cost of compliance clearly acts as a giant hurdle for Bitcoin processors and exchanges. FinCEN regulations seemingly seek to create a closed circuit in which money circulates, and in which every transfer can be tracked. That this has failed miserably has been illustrated by the recent [money](http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/12/news/companies/hsbc-money-laundering/index.html) [laundering](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/standard-chartered-settles-with-new-york-for-340-million.html?hp&amp;_r=0) [scandals](http://nypost.com/2014/06/04/bnp-paribas-probed-over-100b-money-laundering-scheme/) as well as the fact that criminals continue to use of plain old cash. The effectiveness of anti-money laundering regulations is [increasingly](http://www.economist.com/node/5056338?story_id=E1_VDVGPPR) [questioned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Value_of_enforcement_costs_and_associated_privacy_concerns). Considering the questionable effectiveness of these regulations, the net effect of these regulations comes down to protecting the established finance industry and make life hard for new contenders such as BitPay, that have nowhere near the resources as for instance a giant such as VISA, for which the cost of compliance can be much smaller because of economies of scale. There is no level playing field and the regulations are benefitting the establishment, while hurting new entrants.


**The bigger picture**

Financial scandals, crises, as well as perceived terrorist threats fan ever more stringent rules and regulations that have questionable effectiveness but do increase cost, hurt privacy and diminish autonomy over ones own funds. Recent [civil](http://rt.com/usa/199883-irs-structuring-civil-asset-forfeiture/) [asset](http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2014/10/27/a-new-irs-horror-story-that-makes-past-scandals-pale-in-comparison/) [forfeitures](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/us/law-lets-irs-seize-accounts-on-suspicion-no-crime-required.html) by the IRS under the [Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2014/03/13/bill-hr1658enr-2000.pdf) are a manifestation of the latter. Cash amounts of over $10,000 are [suspicious by default](http://www.forbes.com/2011/06/08/property-civil-forfeiture.html) and have to [be reported](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Workbook-on-Reporting-Cash-Payments-of-Over-$10,000) using [form 8300](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8300.pdf) - the justification might be that the pervasive presence of banking does not require the use of large sums of cash, which are therefore suspicious by default. Obviously, this discourages the use of cash and makes it very difficult to do large transactions outside of the closed financial circuit.

The presumptions here are:

* Possession of large amounts of cash is suspicious, because mostly only criminals (terrorists and money launderers) do this;
* Banks can be entrusted with all your money, distrust of banks is no justification to keep more than $10,000 outside of the banking system;
* The government acts in your best interest and can be trusted not to misuse the fact your funds can be frozen and seized.

It needs no arguing here that each of these presumptions are false.

For the first time in history, Bitcoin offers a way to store value privately, anonymously (if done properly) and such that it is impossible to confiscate. Now this is something new, and it profound. On the shallow practical side, doing a transaction valued more than $10,000 is trivial. Money stored as bitcoin can be accessed anywhere and at all times. Although rules and regulations apply, the ability to fully anonymously access and transfer value (if the proper precautions are taken) make them unenforceable.

The resistance against confiscation gives Bitcoin additional utility. For this to work, Bitcoin must offer a way to be used completely anonymously. Because if a government knows you own bitcoin which they cannot seize, they can seize your car, house or ultimately *you yourself* instead (as in, put you in jail), until you give up your bitcoin. Full anonymity is therefore not a nice-to-have, it is essential in offering protection against confiscation of wealth.

Another well known avenue to confiscate wealth of an entire nation is by monetary inflation. Simply printing or creating money enriches those close to where the money surfaces first - at the expense of those who receive the money last. In quantitative easing, banks sold illiquid bonds to the Fed, and receive cash in return which they used to prop up their balances or to buy assets. Since bank lending has not much improved, the overall effect on the economy has been low. However, bank stocks are doing great - clearly showing banks gained most from QE, [outperforming the Dow Jones industrial average as well as the S&amp;P500 by a margin](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=XLF+Interactive#%7B%22range%22%3A%7B%22start%22%3A%222009-03-05T04%3A00%3A00.000Z%22%2C%22end%22%3A%222014-10-28T04%3A00%3A00.000Z%22%7D%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%2C%22comparisons%22%3A%7B%22SPY%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23cc0000%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%2C%22%5EDJI%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23009999%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%7D%7D), a rebound that kicked off in earnest a mere 4 months after the start of QE in November 2008. Since wealth can not be created by the QE magic wand, left or right this gain has been at the expense of everyone else owning dollars.

More extremely, history is full of [countries defaulting on their debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_debt_crises) - often rendering their currency worthless with obviously devastating effects on most of the population. Another profoundly new property of Bitcoin is the predictability of the rate in which it is created, and the hard limit which is set at 24 million bitcoins ever to be created. This offers owners of bitcoin the peace of mind that the value of bitcoin can not be stolen insidiously by means of inflation - as it can and is done today with fiat.

Clearly, in its design, Bitcoin offers resistance against inflation and confiscation, two privileges misused by governments all over the world and throughout history. This can be one of the reasons why Bitcoin appeals to many as a way to store value safely - the irony here being of course the many Bitcoin related scams and people losing their coins through theft. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is still immature technology but rapidly improving - it is only a matter of time before stolen coins are mostly a thing of the past. No regulation required.

In the mean time, there although economic improvement is reported, this [growth is not experienced by consumers](http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economy-grew-at-4-6-rate-in-second-quarter-1411734858). Burdensome regulations, combined with the uncharted territory of QE as well as [USA debt being higher than ever except during WW2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#mediaviewer/File:Federal_Debt_Held_by_the_Public_1790-2013.png) will make some people reason to be skeptical towards the current economical *and* political state of affairs, and this may be an additional factor in the attraction towards bitcoin as an alternative store of value.

So far the focus was on the USA, where Bitcoin adoption is the largest. However the world is a big place and the global nature of Bitcoin as well as the regulatory harassment in the USA might well mean that Bitcoin will prosper elsewhere first. The global nature of Bitcoin and the fact that anyone without a bank account or credit card can now also participate in global commerce was previously impossible and very exciting in itself. Who knows what derivatives built on top of Bitcoin may hold in the future.

In the long term, Bitcoin will just not go away, it will prevail, and grow. Either gradually, or in the event of a new economic crisis or a period of high (USD or EUR) price-inflation, perhaps in a big way.

technology,Why do carriers (US) give Wifi calling a bad rap?,"I used to have T-Mobile years ago and the killer feature for me was UMA, which was calling over wifi.  It was so clutch, I bought specific phones just to use it.  But that fizzled out for some reason.  ATT has their poorly implemented MicroCell, which is brilliant in concept.  It is the absolutely perfect technology, and yet gets no attention, no support, and barely works. ATT might actually get around to a proper Wifi calling rollout next year, but I'm not holding my breath. 

Everytime I see an article about this, the feedback is that by having Wifi calling, a carrier is admitting to their own shortcoming in their service coverage.  Why does this idiotic attitude persist?  Is this a lie being told to try to avoid rolling out this technology, or do people actually believe this and the carriers are ""afraid""?

Does this technology come with some kind of additional cost or complexity?  Are carriers afraid of having to tech-support someones bad Wifi connection when calls get dropped?

If you have a below grade basement in a house, or your house is buried in a heavily wooded area, your reception is going to suck and no outside cell tower is going to fix that.  Is this really the fault of the carrier?  I get full strength outside my house, but lousy coverage in my house.  Why would I NOT want to have Wifi calling?

I can save 0.25% on my interest rate by signing up for automatic payments which I am comfortable doing.

I would like to build up an emergency fund but also want to make more than minimum payments on my loans. 

Do I spend a large chunk of my savings on this first payment towards my higher interest loan to just take it out quickly? Or do I make minimum payments until I have built up an emergency fund and then start knocking out the loans? I hope to start paying $500-$600/month towards loans once I build up savings to meet my payoff goals.

personalfinance,Should I Wait for my Moving Bonus?,"Hello /r/personalfinance! After being a roamer for the last three months and learning a lot from you guys, I finally have a question of my own! In just under a month, I will be relocating to the state of Florida for work. It's both exciting and ushers in several new considerations with how I prepare for the move and changes in my income.

A bit of a background first. I have had this position since July and am currently living in Maryland. I have only been considered a ""Maryland resident"" since July. Because of the move to Florida, I will no longer be paying state income taxes from my pay check. The questions that this raises, however, I am turning over to you all!

First, since I will have lived in Maryland for less than 183 days, do I not qualify for Maryland state taxes? The reason I ask this is because I read a CNN Money article that said that you technically aren't a state resident unless you've lived there for 183 days... Odd I thought. But I'm curious of how that will reflect on my tax forms when the spring rolls around.

Second, I am receiving a moving bonus for relocation on this project. The bonus amounts to $2500 to cover the costs of any flights or Uhaul needed for the move. However, the bonus I am receiving will be taxed for state and federal. My question is whether or not it would be better to receive it early on to cover the costs or if it would be worth holding out to receive the bonus after I have moved to Florida?

The only reason I'm wondering is if it would even make that big of a difference to claim Florida residency to save a little bit on the income tax. I'm very new to this stuff, so I figured I would turn to you all for advice. I sincerely appreciate the help in advance and would be willing to provide more information if needed!

TL;DR- moving to Florida from Maryland. Is it worth it to hold out on a moving bonus so I can claim it without income tax? What happens to other taxes taken in Maryland if I was living there for less than 183 days?

Thank you! :D",finance,1414644763

personalfinance,Should I study abroad?,"Hey /r/pfinance,

First off, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate what you guys do for people here. Personal finance is such a byzantine field, and you guys -- some of whom are obviously experts who could, and likely do, charge for similar services -- helping others solely for the sake of helping is inspiring. There aren't many places on Earth where one could find similar help.

All that being said, I do need your help now. I'm a sophomore at The College of New Jersey, a very well-respected public college. I have merit scholarship, as well as a few others, but because it's a public school the scholarships are meager at best. In the end, I pay about 24k per year. Additionally, my parents are in no position to be helping me financially, and even though I work two jobs on campus and have jobs at home, I can't pull in the funds to make any significant difference in the net cost. Most of that money amounts to little more than petty cash. So, needless to say, my college is paid through loans. Last I checked, I have around 44k in private loans, after interest, and another 8k in federal loans. 

Now comes the actual question: I was accepted to study abroad at Oxford University next semester through the Oxford Study Abroad Program. I've taken all the steps necessary, including my school's $425 application fee, and am prepared to go next semester. That being said, the program, which runs from January to June, is $30,900. I get my second semester tuition at TCNJ refunded to me, and my financial aid follows me, so the total gap would be around 15-17k that would need to be taken out in a loan. That represents almost another year's worth of loans for a semester long experience. This is definitely the program I want to do, and I couldn't change it even if it wasn't; it's either this or not going.

Additionally, I intend to pursue a transfer to a different school following my sophomore year at TCNJ. My top choices are Ivy League or equivalent, which obviously means Ivy League prices. I REALLY want to go abroad, and if I transferred, I wouldn't be able to do so. This is my only chance as an undergrad, and quite possibly my only chance as a student of any kind. The scholarships available to students studying abroad in the UK are EXTREMELY limited for people of my gender and ethnicity. 

So, I guess, should I study abroad? Is it responsible, and even if it isn't, is studying abroad more important than responsibility. 

EDIT: I'm a political science and psychology double major, heading toward law school, presumably. My loans are from NJCLASS, which I'm honestly not sure if it's government or private, but it's certainly not federal. I'm only eligible for $5000 subbed Stafford loans.

EDIT 2: I'm considering transfer because I find TCNJ to simply not be enough for me. I'm 44k in debt and yet feel like it's not been a poor investment. I feel smarter than everyone, and every professor and student seems to think I'm impressive. I don't want to be impressive. I want to have to work exceptionally hard, and I don't need to here while still maintaining a 3.9. That's all very tl;dr, but I think you get the gist.

Edit 3: I MIGHT be able to change my duration with OSAP to only stay for one UK term, or about 13 weeks. That would only cost $21k, but it would leave me with a weird amount of free time when I returned to the States, and brings up the question of whether or not it's worth it temporally speaking.",finance,1414681509

personalfinance,Buying part of my neighbors property... Seeking advice on best balance of HELOC &amp; my savings,"Hey,

**Little background:**

Bought my first house about 14 months ago. It’s a true “first home.” Paid 175k for 1050 square feet, 2 bed, 1 bath. 5k square foot lot. Since buying it, I’ve put on a new roof, new furnace, exterior/interior paint, ripped up old shag carpet to find nice wood floors – refinished those, etc. A TON OF SWEAT EQUITY. 

My house is positioned on the back of the lot, so I don’t have a back yard, and the property line on one side of my house is about 10” away. Lucky for me, the developer who was going to build a mansion next to my house changed his mind and sold to my neighbor on the other side of the lot. It’s a 6,500 square foot lot. My neighbor paid 200k for the lot. It’s a field and looks like my yard if you drive by.

I am buying 1,500 square feet of that lot from my neighbor. It will be a great addition to my property. It will allow me to build a nice side yard, fence that in to create a private yard since I don’t have a back yard and it will allow future additions of my house if I ever want to remodel. 

I am paying 20k for the section of property. Based on the 200k that he spent on the lot, 1,500 square feet of it should be closer to 50k. My neighbor is cutting me an incredible deal. This price includes the necessary surveying, and documentation with the city. Seriously… greatest neighbor on earth.

**The financial question:**

I have 12k in savings and about 60k in various retirement accounts (will not touch the retirement accounts, but added that for context.) I am taking out a line of credit to pay my neighbor for the property. The interest rate will be 3.75%, but I may lock it in, which causes it to jump to around 5.5%. I like having the 12k in savings as a just-in-case fund, but I’m looking for advice on if perhaps I should take a decent chunk out of my savings (say $5k) and only 15k on the line of credit to minimize any money spent on interest. 

I plan to be fairly aggressive about paying it off, but if I lock it in it will be a 15-yr loan and I figure in 5-7 years, I may be looking to sell the house and could pay any remainder off then.

Finally… I am wondering if you can think of a good way for me to pay my neighbor with my credit card to get airmiles out of the deal… ya, I know I’m being greedy, but if I can do a little manufactured spending here, I could pay the card off instantly with the line of credit.

I am currently a college Junior and will be graduating in May 2016. I just want to make sure what I had been doing is right and I want to get on a plan to make sure I am in a good situation once I graduate. I figured it would be better to start now and be well prepared than be SOL later. 

About Me: I am an engineering undergrad, it is normally a 5 year program and I will be graduating in 4 years. I live in a major city at home with my parents during that time. I will graduate with student loan debt. When I graduate I estimate (worst case scenario) approximately $25k in federal (8 loans, average 4.4%) and $25k in private student loans (3 loans, average 8%). I currently work at a small bank doing data entry type stuff and make $10 and have a very flexible schedule (which has allowed me to do fairly well in school). At 18, I applied for 4 credit cards and now because of it I have over 20k credit availability. This has drastically helped my credit score from 640 a little over a year ago to 735 now (TransUnion) .

Stats:  
Checking: $500  
Savings: $1200  
Biweekly Paycheck (after taxes): $335  
Monthly In-School Private loan Payment: $25  
Credit Card Debt (still 0% for 8 more months): $700  
Total Credit Availability: $22,500  

Also about a year ago I lent my parents $2.8k (that I had saved up) to pay off their credit cards because they were just making minimum payments. They pay me back $50 every paycheck and they still have about 2k left to pay me back. (I don't really give them a hard time about it or anything as they let me live at home rent free, and get dropped off everyday which adds 20 minutes to my dads commute).

SO any advice or goals that i should strive for right now. Personally, I am very goal motivated so specific number goals would be great. Thanks!",finance,1414705743

personalfinance,Employer withheld much less federal tax than they should have,"Last week, I turned in a new W-4 to HR. On it, I put down 0 exemptions (line 5) and asked that they withhold an *additional* $100 (line 6) from each paycheck in federal taxes (I did some independent contracting work earlier in the year and didn't save for taxes, so I wanted to at least partially make up for this by withholding extra federal taxes from my current income). However, someone botched things when entering it into our payroll system, and only $100 was withheld from this paycheck. I don't know how to calculate exactly how much should have been withheld, but I estimate that another $600 or so should have been withheld instead of paid to me.

My question: is there any option other than holding on to the extra money I was paid until tax time? Is there a good reason to do anything different?",finance,1414712343

personalfinance,Messed up W-4 and owe taxes. Losing job in two months. Advice?,"Anyone who can provide advice to me will be sincerely thanked!

So I made a big mistake when I filled out my W-4 form when I got my job back on the last week of July: I put ""exempt"" when I actually wasn't exempt. This was my second time filling out a W-4 ever and I mistook the language on it. Therefore, I have not paid any federal income tax or state income tax (California) since that last week of July up to today. I have, however, paid these taxes since the beginning of the current tax year with my previous job, which was right until the last week of July.

I will be losing my job after the first week of December (got outsourced...). After doing some math I owe around $1,020 in FIC and $250 in SIT. Now that I will start having my taxes taken out, I'll take home about $550 a week. I have to pay monthly rent of $700 (plus utilities that will add up total to about $60) and student loan payment of $340. I have about $2,300 in savings.

So my question is: should I put in MORE money in taxes on my next paychecks and just live mega-frugal for the next months, OR should I wait until filing taxes when, they take out whatever I would've gotten in a refund, and just pay the difference then? I'm a bit worried because I have no idea how long it will be before I get another job. I don't want to get into any sort of financial trouble or have some collection agency come at me and affect my credit score (cause it's decent right now and I definitely need it to stay that way).

Side note: I know I should have more money saved, but after the death of my mother, I had $0 to my name. I've been working hard to keep a roof over my head, food on the table, and still enjoy a night at the movies sometimes.",finance,1414724663
personalfinance,Best place for long term travel cash,"Ok here I go again*.  Recieved a letter from a major fund I traded into 2.3 yrs (mm to small cap) that I had 30 days to respond or the state of TX would transfer it to their ""unclaimed property division"" since, according to them, I hadn't contacted the fund in over 3 years.  This is false since I have the confirmation ltr and even if a database error, ....still not comforting. 

First thought was it's a hoax, so I call the fund direct and it's legit.  Not only that but the out of state webhelp obviously dealt with other Texans on this matter, ... plus other states with similar policies.  Problem should be solved but here's are my PF issues: 

(1) The letter claims I need to contact the fund family at least every 3 years but the state of TX website is currently saying every year for funds, stocks, bonds, other financial accounts. 

http://www.window.state.tx.us/up/generalinfo.html

Texas doesn't ""confiscate"" the assets, according to their website anyways, but holds them.  Still 1 year or 3? 
Now before accusations of TX hate, other states have had this problem and while they need to be careful identifying the rightful owner, out of 41 billion only 2 billion has been returned (2013) /  ... not a system one wants to be caught up in.

http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/05/pf/unclaimed-money/

Basically add TX to that list.  So if in a fund or brokerage it's pretty much mandatory to buy/sell since ""buy and hold"" is now ""abandonment"" - not what was taught in personal finance but ok.  Would've been nice to know prior to aforementioned letter though...

(2) Compounding this is another problem with other savings I want to travel with for fun, but if ""abandonment"" dates are seemingly shortening, I need an account with some true activity (gains obviously doesn't count). 

I've traveled overseas for 13 mo. at a time for work as a Texan and this wasn't an issue in the past (direct deposit).  However if the state is cracking down on ""abandoned"" financial assets, I am really loathe risk reclaiming my accounts just because of international work or play (hell I've been working in-state and I still got the f'ed up notice).

 So my tentative solution (have traded US accounts overseas and went thru securely about 5 years ago) ... is put it all in one taxable brokerage account linked to my checking and maybe set a couple days per year to buy/sell, keeping the acct active (considering that my old standby of having money markets and brokerages for the past 20 years isn't good enough anymore as per the correspondance and the website accessed at this post)? Regardless of state since other states likely have similar policies btw.  Thoughts? Any other suggestions for a traveller who doesn't want to find their accounts transfered especially if overseas?

Trade history : mostly index but have halted my US vacations to trade TVIX, DDD -- closed out profitably - not my first rodeo.  Lost money in short term bond funds of all places, so don't recommend.  I might need to stay away from market news though.

personalfinance,Pay off credit card or put money in my house savings account (explained inside) (Norway),"Ok, this may perhaps be a bit more of mathematical problem, but as far as I can tell it's better to put the money into the house savings (BSU) account.

BSU is a type of account for young people (under 33) in Norway. You can save up to 25 000 NOK (roughly $3700) yearly, up to a maximum of 200 000 NOK (roughly $30k). 

If you save the yearly maximum, you will get 5000 (20% of 25000) back on your tax returns. So save 5000, get 1000 back. 

My specific account also has a 4,7% interest rate. Is it wrong to think that this gives me a 24,7% ROI?

Meanwhile, my CC with a negative balance of around 9000 NOK (roughly $1340) has an effective interest rate of 21,97%

It's also worth noting that if you cancel the BSU account, you will have to pay back the tax benefit you've recieved. 

Any thoughts? I haven't started by BSU savings yet, and at 23 years old it's about time to do so.

personalfinance,A heads up to recent graduates about to start repayment!,"It has been some months now since graduating and my loans are entering repayment. I made a decision to run a credit report a few days ago and it seriously saved my skin.  
  
I am thankful to be well employed and now paying down my student loans, however something strange caught my eye on my credit report. I had just recently graduated and left my state to find career opportunities in a major city. Now I only took out  private loans via SallieMae who told me that they were also managing my federal loans. My credit report was taken out twice this year: the first was two months after graduating (looking normal) and the second was just days ago. The second report told me something new: I had one federal loan that was for some reason handled by a different company and I was never alerted (even though the loan was taken through my university a year before graduating and they had my contact information on file AND I had an exit counseling session about my loans). It is currently in grace, but had I not ran a credit report I would have not known about it and the company would have no way of contacting me since I left the state! I would have been screwed! I had to call them and fork over my SSI because I never even got a notice with an account number. 
  
I was angry at myself and my university that I came so close to hurting my credit score. My TL;DR is WORK WITH YOUR UNIVERSITY to make sure ALL loans are accounted for upon graduation. It sounds idiotic, but when I saw that SallieMae had taken on what looked like 100% of my federal loans in addition to my private loans it didn't occur to me that my university also could have used other companies and not informed me (unless you seek it out). I EVEN HAD AN EXITING CONSULTATION WITH MY UNIVERSITY ABOUT MY LOANS. It wasn't brought up. Ugh I could just kick someone. I'm on the phone with them today to make sure there are no more surprises.  
  
**EDIT**: This wasn't Navient. I was aware SallieMae was split. This was an entirely different company called ACS.  
  
**HOW TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING TO YOU**: Ultimately, if this loan hit the fan it would have been my fault, but that still doesn't mean this is a straight forward process unless your armed with some knowledge. If you are about to graduate with loans please go to https://www.nslds.ed.gov where the government keeps a tab on all of your federal loans. This won't help with private, but at least you'll be able to find out who owns what when it comes to your federal loans. You will need your PIN (Don't know what a PIN is? If you took out a government loan you have one. Check out this site to find out what your PIN is: https://pin.ed.gov/PINWebApp/pinindex.jsp), your SSI, your date of birth and other personal details.   
  
Also, please make an appointment with Financial Aid. Prepare questions ahead of time and make sure you fully are aware of how much you will be paying after school and who owns your loans.

Some background:

I graduated college at 2013. Went to a semester of Grad school.

* Currently 14k Student loan, $145/mo payment. (Fedloan, 3.5, 4.5, 4.5%)
* 4 Credit cards, paid off fully except of one card that has 4k CC debt (0% apr till March. I'm not using this card and I'm paying as much as I can. Bought stuff to make my work more efficient.)
* I make $13/hr, no 401k. Saves $400/mo for emergency funds.
* Live at home, so no rent.

I currently have 2 cars and I'm debating to sell one (current value around 14k) to pay off my student loan. But the issue is that when my family visits me, They will eventually need one car too. That's why I own two cars. 

Before this I was debating to get another car, a car that I really wanted, and make the $14k car as a down payment, keeping my monthly payments around $350/60 mo (Yes, I know I'll get bashed by doing this, but I could not help. That's why I'm here.)

So here's the question, Should I be selling my car and paying off my student loan fully? 

The difference between paying it after 10 years and now is a $3k difference.

Or should I be paying off lets say $12k, and keep 2k across the 10 years for paying a minimum and stretching out my credit score account length?

Or, keep the current two cars and pay the $145 over the next 10 years.

Will paying off my student loans increase the amount and lower rates I can get for car loans? (got offer for 19k at 3.44% few weeks ago, 21k at 3.45% last month. I was really looking forward buying a car.)

I may be going to prison. I recently was federally indicted for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, distribution of a controlled substance, and money laundering. Money was seized by the FBI out of a my bank account.

That's really as far as I need to go with that. I'm not here for legal advice, I do have a lawyer. I am here to ask, what you would do if you where in my situation (or rather my fiance's situation)?

**Let us just assume I am already gone.**

My main concern is my fiance and son. My fiance is aware of what is going on with my situation. I am worried that at her current job (fast food) she will not be able to survive on her own. She makes about $21k/year before taxes.

After I was indicted we moved into a rent to own house, we pay $700/month $350 of that goes to the seller, and $350 goes towards the principle of the house. We currently owe $52,900 the house was originally $72,000. Our current monthly bills are sure to change due to the fact that we now have 1 less person in the house. That being said she will now have to pay for full time daycare, as I was in charge of watching our son, as well as taking him to school (part time).

Bills:
Rent - $700 ***Rent is paid off till the end of 2015***
Car Insurance - $130
Gas Bill - $50
Electric - $99
Cell phone - $80
Internet - $30
Cable - $30
Gas for work - $30 (give or take)
Food - $150-200 (best guess)

That puts her at $1351/month ($635/month if you take away the rent) before daycare, which I have to call around and see what it will be.

I was considering an FHA loan to lower her rent, but her credit isn't really established. She has a 755 credit score. Not too sure how this would work but I feel like she should be able to use what we've already paid into the house as a down payment for the loan.
Now my fiance has been working in fast food all her working life (she is 23). She worked at Wendy's moved her way up to an assistant management position. She had a falling out after having to testify against one of her friends for when Wendy's fought her claim for unemployment. She put her 2 weeks notice in after securing a job at Burger King for the same position, slightly better pay. What I am trying to say is she has a very good work ethic and has no issues keeping a job.

I have pleaded with her to look for a job/career that she could do for the rest of her life, or to go to school. I wanted her to do anything that would make it so she wouldn't have to come home almost every night miserable. I offered to pay for her school, all she needed to do is pick what she wanted to be, she has yet to do so. It just seems like she wants to work at Burger King for the rest of her life.

Question:

Is there really anything I can do to prepare her for supporting her our son while I am away?",finance,1414797191
