personalfinance,Please help a poor young lady out with a financial decision... thanks. (Sorry for wall of text),"Hello friends. The world of personal finance is new to me. I hope I don't sound naive. Feel free to explain like I'm 5. Please know that I have only done some preliminary research on this, so I'm far from making a decision about anything. If I sound like I haven't done enough research or planning yet to make a decision, you would be correct. I'm just hoping you guys could start me in the right direction.

Ok. I'm looking to get a medical procedure done. It will not be covered by my health insurance. More or less, it's considered an elective surgery and there are specific guidelines to meet in order to qualify that I don't meet. I believe that getting this procedure done will ultimately be the best thing for my health, my well being, and even my financial future to some degree. It will alleviate a chronic illness that will lead to big medical bills and pain in the future. Aside from that, my quality of life would improve significantly, and that's something that all the money in the world can't buy. Please consider all of this.

The cost of this procedure would be about $7500. I would need to take out some sort of loan to pay for this. People who get this procedure typically do one of the following things: 1. use a medical loan company  like Citerra and MedLoanFinance.com(I've read that interest rates can be ridiculous like 15-25%) 2. put it on credit cards or 3. get personal loans. 

The last time I checked my credit score probably a few months ago, it was in the middle of the average category. Maybe that might help you determine what a potential interest rate for me might be. I'm still settling into a new job in a different part of the country, so I'm still trying to determine what my monthly expenses are, but it looks like the total amount of surplus income I have every month (minus rent, health insurance, food, student loans etc.) is about $500 or so. I definitely realize that this is not a lot, but luckily I have experience living with low means. 

Another thing to note is that I work for the federal government, and I contribute to retirement, FERs (similar to a 401k... and separate from the regular retirement), and Social Security. I feel a little bit better knowing that some money of mine is being saved somewhere. I also have access to starting a Flex Savings Account, which I may be able to use for this procedure (need to double check). There are probably other government benefits that I'm not even aware of, since I just started.

I'll also throw in that I'm a very determined person. If getting this procedure means I have to take public transportation everyday, have no social life (not like I have one now), no Starbucks in the morning, so be it! I could see myself contributing as much money as humanly possible every month. Aren't there credit cards/loans that offer 0% interest for 1 year. I might not be able to pay the whole thing off in one year, but if I really tightened up my budget for that one year, hopefully I could make a solid dent so that the interest wouldn't destroy me.

I do have supportive people in my life, but borrowing money from people is something that I'm not open to doing.

If you were in my position, what sort of options would you pursue? Where should I start my search for financing my procedure?

Thank you, kind people.",finance,1414805548
personalfinance,Netflix knew about my new debit card before I did?,"I'm feeling like the security of my financial information is being violated here, and I'm not sure what to do about it, if anything.

Rough timeline of events:

~October 20th = Navy Federal Credit Union determines that my debit card may be at risk of fraud/bad things due to recent Target/Home Depot/Whatever data breach, and elects to issue me a new debit card to be on the safe side. If they notified me about this via email or otherwise, I missed it.

October 25th = I receive an email from Netflix telling me that there's a problem processing my payment, which is a notice I've seen before, doesn't concern me at all. I had been issued a new card somewhat recently (before the card this post is about) so I figured I just missed updating my Netflix info or something. I don't use Netflix much, so I figure I'll just ignore it for now and fix it next time I want to watch stuff.

October 26th = I log into eMusic (a music buying service) and am greeted with a page informing me that my payment information needs to be updated before I can go buy songs. I am confused because they have filled in some new payment information for me using a card ending in shall-we-say 1234. To my knowledge, I've never had a card ending in 1234, so I send eMusic an eMail saying ""Where did you get this card information, I don't have a card like that."" 

October 28th = I'm going through my mail at around 2am, and discover that my credit union issued me a new debit card, ending in 1234. I'm very concerned as I didn't order a new debit card, and the fact that eMusic already had the info starts screaming ""FRAUD!!!"" to me, so I call my credit union to sort things out. I am informed that my old card was determined to be at risk, so they issued me a new one to be safe. I ask ""But how did eMusic know I had a new card before I did?"" The summarized response amounted to ""something about the way those companies process the information allows them to pick up your new card info.""

October 29th/30th = eMusic responds to my customer query with a copy-paste response of helpful instructions on how to update my payment information. I angrily reply that they have misread/ignored my problem, which is that they got my new card information without my knowledge.

October 31st = I get an apologetic email from eMusic, claiming that there's no way for them to get my payment information without me. I tell them that this clearly isn't true, because they apparently had that information days before I opened the envelope to discover my new debit card. **MEANWHILE**, I get an email from Netflix that essentially reads: ""No more payment problem! We charged the card ending in 1234!"" I certainly didn't give Netflix my new card info, and I call them immediately to find out how they got this info. The woman on the other end tells me she's seen this before and was just as freaked out as me at that time. According to her research team, the card issuer is able to update this information *for* me as a *courtesy* so monthly bills like gym or website memberships can continue uninterrupted.

So the way I see it is like this:

I don't like that these companies were able to obtain my new card information A: before I have that information, and B: without my knowledge or consent. I especially don't like that Netflix charged my new card without my consent. It isn't clear which entity (the credit union, Visa, or the services) is the culprit, I feel like they're all pointing fingers. I'll readily admit that maybe there is something I didn't read in the Terms &amp; Conditions that allows any of these groups to do this, but that doesn't mean I like it. To be fair, the new 1234 card is connected to the same checking account as the old card, but I don't feel like that means I automatically consent to these services using that card, ESPECIALLY when I don't know about that card.

So, am I being violated here, is this something I should even be concerned about (my card information being used without my knowledge/consent) and is there anything I can or should do?",finance,1414810888

personalfinance,Help me with my current car situation!,"Hi,

I purchased a vehicle back in February which I feel like it was a mistake. I'm paying too much for it and just want to know what you guys think my options can be or if I'm pretty much screwed...

I owe 21k on the car but the trade in value is around 16k. (I was already upside down on my previous trade in).

Interest rate is 4.5% on 6 year loan.

I pay $375 a month on car payments. $200 a month on gas, and $160 on car insurance. 

I make $55k a year but I still feel like I am paying way too much on my overall auto expenses.

personalfinance,Should I finance a car for a long term (let's say 60 months) to keep my monthly payments low if I am planning to sell the vehicle in a year or two?,"Here's the situation:

My wife and I sold both of our vehicles in preparation for an international relocation.  Unfortunately, that fell through.  I have accepted a job offer in another state, so we need a vehicle to both replace our current rental when it's returned and to help us move.

The job pays well, but money is a little tight at the moment.  So when the time comes to buy a car before the move, I'm thinking of buying something cheap, making a down payment, and doing a 60 month term on the financed balance.  In about a year, after the move and after more money has been saved, we will trade-in the car and buy a more long-term vehicle.

The question I'd like some help evaluating is if this is a wise idea or not.  I understand longer term financing will increase the interest rate, but since retaining money right now is the priority, I think this could be worth doing in order to get a lower monthly payment.

Thanks!",finance,1414834319

personalfinance,Am I on track to retire?,"Hey guys, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this or not, and since I’m going to give personal financial information I’m using a throw away.  I do plan on talking to a financial advisor, but wanted to get a quick opinion on our situation from others.

I started saving for retirement pretty late in life.  I’m now 36, and my wife is 30.  We started saving when I was 32.  I know we’re well off, I have no illusions otherwise, but am still worried about retirement.  My question is, do I need to ramp up savings?  Am I over-saving (I know you can’t over save, but if I could save less, we could do more fun stuff), or am I on track?

Right now my wife and I make a combined total of $200,000 per year.  We own a condo in Arlington, VA that’s worth ~$530,000 and owe ~$480,000 on it.  Our interest rate is 3.25%.  We plan on living here for 3 more years, then renting it out until it’s totally paid off.  We may sell, or hold it for monthly income, it just depends on how much of a pain it is.

My 401K has a balance of about $55,000 and my contribution is maxed out.  My employer matches something, but not much.  I think it works out to be about $120 a month.  I’m aggressively investing, last year I got a 13% return, this year it’s about 6%.
My wife’s 401K has a balance of about $14,000 and she contributes $7,040 per year, her employer match isn’t much better than mine.  It’s also aggressively invested, but this year she only got a return of 2%.

I have a crappy IRA that has $12,000 in it, and it probably gets about 2% per year (and has done about that rate over the last 3 years).  I don’t contribute to it at all and may have to do something with this money since I don’t believe it’s even keeping up with inflation.  I’m thinking of cashing it out and investing in stocks.  I know I’ll take a pretty big hit on it, but maybe I can make up for that hit in the long run?

I have a stock account with $27,000 in it.  I’m investing $19,000 in a combination of DIS, AAPL, and QQQ.  I’ve held those stocks for a few months now and plan on holding them indefinitely.  Before I held them I made a stupid investment in VMW and pretty much got handed my ass, so that part of my account is making about 1.5% this year (it was negative until a month or so ago).  I took $1,000 of that money and turned it into $3,000 very quickly playing with options.  I’m doing extremely well with options, but am only willing to risk my initial $1,000 plus the profits that they have made to date.   I am aware of the risk involved, but I’m averaging 28% profit per week on them.   I attempt to deposit $1,500 per month into this account, and think that’s doable.  The other $5,000 is just sitting in the account in case we need the money quickly.

So, if you add up the above numbers, we have a total of $108,000 in savings.  Same time last year, we had about $60,000.  We don’t have credit card debt, but we owe a combined $20,000 in student loans.  My wife still has 2 years of school left, but generally her balance isn’t increasing throughout the year.  I try to make a big enough payment so the balance doesn’t increase.  We owe about $14,000 on our car (1 car only), but don’t plan on trading it until well after it’s paid off.

Like I said, we live in Arlington, VA which has an extremely high cost of living.  I’d like the option to retire here, but would be willing to move elsewhere if need be.  Most of the online calculators tell me we need about $4 million to retire, and that there is no way we’re going to hit that mark.  Others say we’re fine and it shouldn’t be an issue.

I do plan on talking to a financial advisor, but am curious what reddit’s take on my situation is.  Thanks for the help.

financialindependence,US Expat unique situation- Am I maximizing my tax potential?,"I've been lurking on this sub for over a year, never posted before. I'm 27 male, married 1 child another on the way. We live in Europe but work for a US company who still allow me to contribute to a 401(k), I make more than the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) ($99,000k 2014) and have been contributing to a Roth IRA for my myself and my wife up to the limit of my taxable income, which is generally covered under our standard deduction. Thus far we haven't paid any US Federal Income taxes, I still pay SS and Medicare up to the limit. Also I'm on military orders which allow me to not pay taxes in the host country. I have to be in a country other than the USA for 330 days a year or I lose the FEIE due to the Physical Presence test.

Details:

* $118,000 Salary + cost of living adjustment

Assets

* $88,000 Roth 401k + company match

* $10,000 Roth IRA Vanguard

* $11,000 Roth IRA Vanguard Wife

* $10,000 taxable investment account

* $10,000 Cash

We max out Roth 401k every year and then contribute to our Roth IRAs up to the total Earned Income that wasn't excluded under FEIE. We could save more but we spend a lot of money traveling around in Europe and flights home aren't cheap. We've decided to try and maximize our tax benefit while still enjoying/taking advantage of where we live. We have a CPA do our taxes every year to try and make sure we stay above board, they specialize in international tax returns. Does anyone have any ideas on how we can take more advantage of our tax situation?",finance,1414853039
personalfinance,Where is the best value to get a personal loan to refinance credit card debt?,"Here's the situation:

Card | Provider | Total Debt | Interest Rate
---|---|----|----
1 | Capital One | $4,172 | 24%
2 | Capital One | $2,712 | 19.9%
3 | Citibank | $1,977 | 18%
4 | Chase | $1,203 | 18.24%
5 | Discover | $2,740 | 20%
Total | -- | $12,804 | --

My income is $63,000/year.

My cost of rent is $1,225/month.

My credit score from credit karma is 684. I have no derogatory marks and have never missed a payment ever. My largest issues are age of accounts (2yrs, 11mons) and my utilization is at 50%. I plan to close the two newest credit cards once I have a refinancing plan to raise my average age of accounts.

I accrued this debt over the course of around 8 months. Since that time I have developed a budget and my finances are turning around. I would like to refinance all of this debt so I have a lower interest rate on the payments. I have been, and plan to continue paying around $1,000 per month on this credit card debt.

I attempted to get a loan from my local credit union, but was denied for length of employment (6 months, new college grad) and ""Excessive unsecured/revolving obligations in relation to income"". I am not entirely sure what the second statement actually means.

I also looked into LendingClub for a loan, but the fees were &lt; $600 which seems excessive for my situation.

I have checking/savings accounts with Ally and Bank of America, but I haven't seen anything from either of them that seems to fit my needs.

Can anyone offer any advice on how I can consolidate this credit card debt? I would like to get my financial house in order before my student loans kick in later this month. Any advice on lending services with reasonable fees would be greatly appreciated, along with any general advice on how I can improve my situation.",finance,1414861995

Essentially taking a loan to pay off a loan. Is this even possible? The dealer would obviously have the title since the car is not paid off.

financialindependence,Where to move money?,"I am getting a bonus in February and I will be notified how much it will be in January. I will also be notified as to what my raise will be! So exciting times ahead.

I'm starting to realize the errors of my ways thanks to this thread. It has literally been eye opening to read the stories of how much people spend and still enjoy their life. I came from families who lived for the things they could buy. I'm trying to change that learned trait about myself. It is difficult and I still have much work to do but I want to ask this thread's advice so I can start to build a good foundation.

Now to the numbers:
Cash: ~600
401k: ~2,500 (vested)
Broker: ~1,800
AMEX: ~(1,300) APR: 22.99%
Auto Loan: ~(18,200) IR: 6.69%
School Loans: ~(27,000) IR: ~3-6%
(The largest amount roughly ~18,000 is at ~6%)

Yearly Salary: ~$61k
401k contribution: 4% of salary and bonus. Company matches 4% and it is vested after working for 3 years. I have worked for 1.
Take Home Net Pay: $3450.00/month
Fixed Expenses: $2,000.00/month
--&gt;This includes: Rent, Loan Payments, Utilities, Phone Bill, Insurance, Internet
Variable Expenses: $2,000 - $750 (Last 6 months average - Goal)
--&gt;This includes: Gas, Food, Weed, Alcohol, Car Maintenance, Clothes and anything else that isn't a planned expense.
(The 6 month average is probably skewed because of fixing my car twice in that time frame, i think it's closer to ~$1,200 when taking out those)

My plans:
I'm going to be getting the bonus paid to me in the first 2 weeks of February. In the meantime I'm going to be tightening my variable budget, most of which is food, but I do foresee extra spending in the near future to buy Christmas gifts for my family. The questions I have in order of the time they can be made actionable:

1. Should I keep the brokerage account? It has a high interest rate for cash (1%), and I have $300 in there. No fee for keeping and holding funds, only for transactions. I read on here all the time that a necessary goal is to max your 401k. Should I do that or should I put that money towards my loans?

2. How should I go about my auto loan? After November I will have 12 months done of the 60 month term. I think because it was my first auto loan they gave me such a high interest rate. Seeing that it is the only loan I can get refinanced, is this a route I should pursue? What are the pros and cons?

3. The money I save from cutting down my spending will go towards what? Should I max out my 401K? Should I build a small emergency fund for large unplanned expenses? My auto maintenance these past few months killed me which is why I have the balance on the credit card. Should they go to my highest interest loan instead?

4. The bonus I'm expecting will be at the least ~$9,000 before tax. I'm hoping for something closer to ~15,000. Where should this money go? I think it should be put towards the highest interest rate loans? What would you recommend?

personalfinance,Am I being taxed properly?,"So, I'm a student, and I get paid the first of the month, 9 months out of the year. I just got paid for the first time, and I feel like I got more than I should have, but I honestly don't really know and I hope that my school would be smart enough to not fuck over its grad students.

Here's the details: I'm in California. My job pays an annual salary of 37k to ""100% time"" employees. Us lowly grad students all work ""50% time"" so our income is 18.5k a year. On top of this income, the school also pays basically all of my tuition, except for some fees, which amounts to another 16-17k each year. I have no idea if I'm expected to pay tax on that.

So, my first check, $2060 gross, netted me $1746. I don't have my actual stub yet, and I am fairly certain that union dues come to 2.1%, meaning the total taxes I payed were only like 13%, which seems drastically lower than what I was expecting to pay. I used to have money in a mutual fund, and just to make sure I didn't end up owing the government at the end of the year, I've always claimed 0 on my W-2. Even though I've recently liquidated those funds, I ended up claiming 0 out of habit, thinking that I'll be making enough to live on in the mean time, and now I'll have a decent refund come tax season (even though typically I would aim for a very small refund: I'd rather my money be in my bank account than in the IRS's).

Should I be worried? I tried using a payroll calculator based on annual salary and just multiplied the monthly taxes by 12/9 to see what I should be paying, which I think would be the correct way to do it, but the tax system is a total nightmare to me.

Thanks for the help.

I work as a seasonal employee for 6 months of the year. I make $18.69/hr, plus OT. This year I made (pre-tax) $25,591 for 5 1/2 months work. My reported annual salary is $39,012. (I don't know if this matters for how they decide to withhold taxes)

This winter I'm collecting unemployment (caveat: unless I can find a job, which is very difficult in my geographic location.) Unemployment is $450 a week, and I have an option to withhold 10% for federal income tax. 

Last year (2013), I received an $800 federal tax refund. My unemployment amount was different ($280/week), but I withheld taxes on it.

Here's my question: Do I choose to not withhold on my unemployment? I'm trying to figure out my winter budget-- $1800 and $1640 are different. Will it mean I get a smaller tax refund? It seems like I'm overtaxed during my work season. I'm relatively new at this stuff.

personalfinance,Considering Discounted ESPP,"I'm interested in pf's opinion on investing in my employer's ESPP discounted at 15%. I have to put in a whole number between 1 and 10% of my gross paycheck to put towards the program. I'm thinking 5% so we'll call it ~$280 per month.

Here's an approximate breakdown of my budget:

* $3600 - Income after taxes, 5% 401(k) contribution, insurance
* $875 - Rent
* $75 - Electric
* $35 - Internet
* $1005 - Savings
* $1200 - Cash per month for everything else (I won't go into where I spend my money, so save your judgment)

This normally leaves ~$400, $120 if I do the stock purchase, for whatever comes up during the month: tires, car repairs, six moth insurance policy, Christmas presents, extra savings, shiny new toys, etc.

I'm thinking about holding the stock for one year and then selling off the oldest shares as they reach one year old to avoid short term capital gains.

dogecoin,DOGE ‘s Advantages in Chinese eyes: eventually replacing BTC,"DOGE ‘s  basic  advantages:

1, DOGE  is one of the three Democratic currency: the Democracy currency, I recognized only BTC, LTC and DOGE. Currency operated by company such as XRP, BTSX, PTS, DNS, in my eyes just get money props, full of tricks but worthless. The remaining fictitious currency basically had only few number of users, since the voters are not enough ,how to talk about democracy?

2, DOGE’s technical strength range NO 2 in all currency : DOGE have an open powerful technical team, some of them are BTC core technician. This year in September DOGE refused LTC’s merged mining conspiracy but choose to create  the AuxPoW mode, this campaign illustrate that DOGE technical strength has far exceeded LTC. Of course, BTC is still have the strongest technical team,while DOGE ranked second,as for LTC development team ,you have to remember: they are very closed-minded, conservative and offended a lot of people on the line.

3, DOGE’s number of users range NO 2 in all currency:from the latest 24 hours active wallet data, BTC / LTC / DOGE data is: 184934,7094,29578, DOGE is16% of BTC, but four times than LTC. You can log in bitinfocharts.com for query at any time.

4, DOGE’s liquidity range NO 2 in all currency:Many people may doubt this view,they think LTC definitely had  larger trading volume, I admit that, but do not forget: LTC entirely relies on mainstream platforms ,in some charge sites, such as btc38.com, bter.com, cryptsy.com, LTC trading volume is no different with the garbage currency, only DOGE’s trading volume can match BTC. I can say responsibly that, as long as DOGE online large platform, the transaction volume should pass LTC soon.

5, DOGE has officially registered non-profit leadership organization --DOGE Foundation, this advantage, among other currency , only BTC have. Legitimate institutional identity allows DOGE have the chance to cooperate with other companies, government departments, international agencies . 

————————————————————————

DOGE unique advantages:

1, Global promotion lineup: DOGE not only has a first-class marketing team, but also each Shibes are enthusiastic promotion ! This phenomenon is not found in any other currency! Do not believe? Ask yourself how you learned DOGE's? And how many people you have led to hold DOGE?

2, a precise designing as tipping. DOGE from the date of publication is on picking up ""tipping"" banner, besides tipping fuction of facebook, DOGE will be uesd on on-line video platform Twitch, which was bought at the price of $ 970 million by Amazon .this is DOGE’s strategic applications, marking DOGE opens offical mode of cooperation with the mainstream website, but also marks DOGE is striding forword the game industry. Look at other coins, except for the BTC traditional payment and exchange capabilities,other coins make no achivement.

3, healthy image, easier to be  accepted by  mainstream society . BTC is currently being abused by hackers, drugs, money laundering organizations, making itself notoriously, despised by mainstream society. More recently even been used in a terrorist organization for extortion. It can be said, BTC, in order to get accepted in mainstream society, even more difficult, is bound to become a political victim. Perhaps, DOGE and BTC ,one is bright while the other is dark,maybe is the best match. As for LTC image, ah, LTC has a image? I have to think seriously......

4, the main technical design of 100 billion finished digged in 1 year,makes the miners’s selling pressure is very low. DOGE , born on  December 8, 2013, has now finished 95% digging, form 100 billion main part finished digging, their is only a month's time. In contrast, BTC digging 64% , LTC just digging 40% .As for the coin prices, Citibank in September pointed that miners throw BTC is an important reason for its low price, and the LTC situation is even worse, there are at least 40% hashrate in the hands of one mines, it can be said LTC has been long-term kidnapped, nobody dare to greatly pull the price of LTC. Under the stimulus by the lever and futures, the miners will surely become the short 's accomplice, the last past six months have been well documented this. In this regard, DOGE says: immune, immune, immune!

5, 5% annual inflation rate advantage, favor by mainstream economic institutions. DOGE after the first year finished digging 100 billion main part, annual fixed output of 5%, which is 5 billion. In this regard, many people can not understand, in my opinion this is one of the most important value of DOGE. According to western economic theory, proper inflation is required by market economy . To fight with the current monetary junk, BTC select fixed total amount , seemingly revolutionary move, but in reality overkill. Specifically, the fixed total amount BTC can not become internationally accepted investment goods, since digging at a certain period, its yield is too low,as for increasing rate, it is difficult to matching with other investment products, then,it become anti-economy .Do not forget that such a collapse of the Bretton Woods system, gold fate befell because of its low output, not to mention the BTC. In my opinion, DOGE is the only fictitious currency can be adopted by international currency markets in the future. This view has been recognised by some Economics Professor (Robert McMillan, former US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Stanford University Economics).

6, the time advantage: BTC / LTC / DOGE birth time are 2009.01.09, 2011.10.08, 2013.12.08, DOGE create such a situation in less than one year's time, its future is promising!

————————————————————————

DOGE’s  problems:

1, trademark issues, cute logo of DOGE have been advanced registed by UltraPRO, the Foundation had submitted opposition application ,and got two-month registration period extension. the outcome is still unknown. Although UltraPRO state that if they registered the trademark,DOGE can use it free of charge, but this should not be tolerated by Foundation. Prepare for the worst, it’s not a big deal for  DOGE to consider to change  its trademark.

2, leaders of DOGE Foundation pay no attention to the price. I had real exprience about this. I contacted them several times and found they show no interest on the price, even ignore the marketing request for DOGE online on the China three exchanges. There are several possible reasons: First, the Board of Directors are technical geeks, maybe their pursue is for the technical perfection, averse to speculators; Second ,DOGE Foundation advocated a healthy, natural mass promotion route, rather than deliberately cater to the market.

————————————————————————

Finally, talk about  DOGE price forecast:

1, surpass  LTC market value, time will be at mid-December of this year. Price will be 8 cent (about 1.5 US cent) or more.

2,surpass BTC market value:,time will be in 1-2 years, as long as DOGE tipping application get supports by more and more websites in china and abroad, or get more support by game companies ,DOGE price will Ushered in the explosive growth. Moreover, leverage and future , will greatly promote the prices. So at that  time, DOGE price is predicting to reach 40 cents (about 7 US cent) .",cryptocurrency,1414895162

personalfinance,Financed a car to help my credit score. Did I make the right choice?,"When I was 16, my dad matched me dollar for dollar to purchase my first car. In January, that car broke down and I sold it. It was my dream to own a motorcycle, so I bought one cash. I realized about 6 months in that it's fun to ride a motorcycle when you want to, however, not when you have to. Naturally, I needed a car. I'm only 23 and was a first-time buyer, so it was difficult for me to get financed for a vehicle, but I was able to find a second chance lender to approve me at a high interest rate (24%). I wanted to raise my credit score as well, so I went through with the deal. I should also mention that I work at the dealership I bought my car from, so other than the high interest rate, I got a pretty good deal. Did I make the right decision, or was/is there a better way I could have gone about things? 

I wasn't able to get a co-signer and I had checked on other prime lenders, but was declined. I was also expecting the interest rate and I can afford the payments on the car without any problems. My credit score has gone up 10 points since the purchase a few months ago and I make my payments for $5 more than I have to and one day earlier, not sure if that makes a difference in the long run.",finance,1414901847
personalfinance,Would I benefit switching to a credit union?,"I fall under the group of being happy with my bank (wellsfargo) and never really complained about anything other than them offering a pretty bad rewards credit line (which my other credit card covers for now).

personalfinance,"400K Student Loans, best approach?","Background info: Little background. I started medical school a few years back. I was unable to qualify for any scholarships or grants. However, it was my life dream to become a physician and heal people.

I graduated 3 years ago, and currently have 2 more years of residency to finish. I then have two more additional years of fellowship to do. In totality, I will have done about 6-7 years of Income Based Repayment. At the moment, I am at 390K in loans with 7.7% interest.
I have heard new news that they are planning to cap PSLF amount to 58,000$. Regardless if I do pursue a career (probably long term as I also want to teach) in medical academia at a public institution, I can probably have the total loan amount forgiven with a hefty tax at the end of the 10 year period.
The question is the contingency plan: If the PSLF is capped at 58000, meaning the federal government proceeds to go through with this, then the question is, how can I tackle a loan amount?

Here is some more info:
I will be 31 yao, with an average starting salary between 200k-250k per year, with a potential retiring salary with bonuses over 300k.
I am currently single, however I do plan to marry my girlfriend (Potential earnings of 100k+).
I currently save a couple of hundred dollars a month, was planning to toss some money in a retirement account.
Either way, my concern is that if PSLF is indeed capped, what is the most efficient way to pay this loan amount off. My calculated monthly payments at a 10 year cycle is about 3500 a month, and 25 year plan is about 2200 a month.

**Should I only refinance the 9.74% and 7.24% private loans? Or should I also refinance the 6.55% public loans?** 

What I'm thinking of doing is trying to get the lowest fixed interest rate I can (3-5%) by going with the 5-year schedule. My minimum payment would definitely increase with the refinance, but I don't think I would/should mind since I plan on paying as much as I can each month anyway.

personalfinance,What should my plan of attack be for paying off my small student loan?,"Compared to most people, I’m pretty lucky when it comes to my after-school finances. My student loan debt is chump change compared to some of the other dilemmas on this sub, but debt is debt and I want to be out of debt in the shortest, cheapest way possible.

In 2010, I took a Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loan for $3,500. At the 6.8% interest rate, that’s $959.16 on top of the principle for a grand total (at the time of writing this) of $4,459.16. Again, not bad.  I’ve since graduated school, and I get to start making payments this month. I think the minimum payment is going to be something like $50 per month.

Right now I’m working in China teaching English, and I net around $1000 USD per month. Not much, but not terrible considering the cost of living here. I could very well make more-than-minimum payments starting this month and just pay the loan off “normally”.

But, I have enough money to pay off the loan right now because I have $5k invested in a index fund. If I wanted to, I could pay off the loan now and use what would have been loan payments to invest back into this fund. But, this fund is making money. When I recently checked, the YTD return was 7.64%, higher than the interest on my loan. I realize that I’m playing with fire on the stock market, but this is a very conservative investment.

Also, this is all the money I have “in the bank”. When I get back to the US after this year of teaching, I'll have what I’ve saved from my paychecks, $1k in my checking account, and whatever is in that fund to “start out”. 

**Start here for TL;DR**

So options to pay off my student loans: A) Pay back the loan gradually by making more-than-minimum monthly payments, which I can afford, or B) Pay off the loan in a lump sum by taking my money off the stock market. Which will set me up for an easier financial beginning when I return to the US and start ""real life""?",finance,1414933080
personalfinance,I created a Google Script Custom Debt Snowball/Avalanche Calculator,"Hi all,

I dove ""deep"" into the heart of google sheets/scripts and came up with a custom function where you feed it in your debt balances (as negatives), interest rates (0.05 rather than 5% but that can change), minimum payments, and additional monthly contributions and it spits out how long each loan will take to pay off. It takes into account interest accrual, rolling the minimum payments from paid off loans into the new additional payment, and can handle snowball or avalanche all based off how you input the information.

The easiest way to use it is to load it into your sheet using the below link and the script gallery then call =debtSnowball(1:2,3:4,5:6,7)
where 1:2 is your loan balances, 3:4 is your interest rates, 5:6 is your monthly payments and 7 is your additional contribution.

I'm in a very tricky situation with my finances at the moment, and I'd like some advice.
I went to a relatively cheap college with no choice but to live on campus. In 4 years, I managed to accumulate a total of over $130,000 in student loan debt.

* Sallie Mae

   * $26,860.75  |  7.00% interest rate


 **Student loan TOTAL:** $134,928.73

Currently, the federal loans and Sallie Mae are still in a grace period. My monthly payment for HESAA is **$750.00**.
I estimate my total monthly minimum payments for all of the loans to be around $1,200.00 once the grace periods end for all of them.

This being said, my total expenses for each month once I am paying all of the loans will be: **$2,075.10**.

After taxes (and 401(k), insurances expenses, etc), I bring home $3,200 per month.

This means that I have an extra $1,124.90.

My main question is: How should I use that remaining $1,100 each month? Should I throw it at the student loans that have the highest interest rates? Or would it make more sense to start investing it?

What kind of student loan options do I have? (Consolidation, forgiveness, etc)?

Using the worst case senario...
$207,307.60 / 20 years =  $10,365.38/year (needed to save yearly for 20 years) compared to $1,450.35/month * 12 months = $17,404.2/year.  I'd save ~$7000 a year for 20 years which would be ~$140,000.

Just trying to figure out my options and seeking advice.   It seems like in all these scenarios it would be best to just do income based paying 10% of income and wait for the forgiveness.  

Also, can the government get rid of loan forgiveness or is it part of the contract made with borrowing that will not be able to be changed? The idea of having $300,000 to $400,000 in debt just to be forgiven scares me.  Yet, if the forgiveness is truly guaranteed it really would increase the quality of life.",finance,1414946727

I made most of my money during an internship this summer and would like to open a Roth IRA before the end of this contribution cycle. I have been looking into Vanguard and ETrade. Any other recommendations? Also, should I contribute the full amount ($5500) since I just have the amount in a savings account currently? I have more than $15000 of expected expenses between June 2015 and December 2015, but will also have started work by then. I just want to make sure that I have enough liquid savings for everything as well as enough for my emergency fund and enough to take advantage of my employer's 401k match next year. Also, I am looking into applying for another credit card with a low interest rate since the max on my student credit card is only $500. I would be smart about using it and not letting debt accumulate, but it would be another helpful tool as I transition into working life.

personalfinance,help w/student loans/rent/possible mortgage,"Alright, so I'm looking for some feedback and advice about what to do here. My wife and I have a ongoing argument about buying a house. She is convinced that it is the right thing to do, but I feel like getting our finances in order first is more appropriate.

The loans:

She has about $60,000 in student loans, 5 totaling around $45k are federal Stafford types, and 1 about $15k as a personal through Bank of America.

We have no other loans, or debt. Cars were paid for in cash, no credit cards, I have no student loans, etc...

Expenses (all monthly) no including loan payments:

Rent is $1,150, about $1,100 for food/gas (family of 4 w/long commutes), around $400 for childcare, $450 on bills/insurance, etc... for a total of around $2,900... ( medical insurance included through my job)

Income:

After taxes, I bring home around $2,500 monthly, and she brings home $2,400 monthly, for a total of $4,900.

Loan Payments:

So after we were married, my parents took over her loan payments as we were scraping to get by. We took over the Bank of America loan and its about $133 monthly. The other loans put together are costing my parents about $500 a month.

Savings:

Our current savings are about $1,800 monthly. We have about $8,000 already saved.

Future expectations:

I will be getting a salary increase yearly, so I'll go from $2,500 after taxes monthly to about $4,200 over the next 2 years. She will probably drop to part time after my income goes up, so child care will go down but her salary will also ( I don't see a pay-raise coming for her anytime soon). So I would estimate our monthly combined income will be around $5,600 monthly in about 2 years.

Future mortgate.

We would be looking at a house around $300,000 for where we live, so assuming around $30,000 down, monthly payments of $1,750.

The Dilema.

Here is the thing. I am convinced that we should pay off the student loans before buying a house. She is convinced we should buy now or as soon as possible. My reasons for paying the loans off are that I feel guilty for my parents help (her parents are not able to help financially), and I feel that to some degree that helps level us out on a financial sense as a couple, as she entered the marriage with the loans. I want us to buy a house together without her having the loans. Also, I feel like financially its less risky to be paying rent while tackling the $800ish monthly payments if one of us looses a job or something. She on the other hand thinks that we are wasting money on rent when we could be building equity, and that our jobs are secure enough to make this work.

Cheat Codes:

So what I didn't mention above is we get a fairly large yearly gift from a family friend of around $12,000 every January. Now this has happened every year since our marriage, but there isn't any guarantee that it will in the future, and I don't want to 'bank' too heavily on it. 

Conclusions.

My thinking here is that we will be able to pay off the Bank of America loan in January, still have ~8k left over, and after saving and the gift next year, be able to pay off the other loans by next January (roughly 14 months from now).

She thinks we should use all the money including the gift and buy a house this spring, and carry both the loans and the mortgage.

I have ~$4,000 in savings which generally stays around the same amount per month. I would say with all my expenses and salary, I'm staying about even since my savings is not growing or shrinking.

**My questions:**

* Should I still consider consolidating my loans?

* It seems like the 6.5% is a rip off. If I setup auto pay now, they offer a 0.25% reduction in interest rates. I've heard if you do that, they pay off the lowest interest rate loans first, so it sounds like a bad idea. I'm not sure if that offer stands after (if) I consolidate; if so, sounds like a good deal.

* Should I maintain my current high payments, regardless of my decision to consolidate?

* $635 is very high and at that rate I'm unable to save at the rate I would like. Considering my wage is expected to increase over time, is it a good idea to lower payments to say $400 while I'm still making a relatively low wage, then increase upon raises?

* Can you recommend readings that might benefit me and my situation?

* Any other advice for my financial situation?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1414958224
personalfinance,Two girls debating about debt consolidation would love your opinions,"I was having coffee with one of my girlfriends and the topic of credit card debt came up.  She maintains that it's better to pay off the debt you've accumulated on a credit card until the balance is empty, paying interest if necessary.

I am of the opinion that I should find a credit card that allows for debt consolidation and has a lower interest rate so that any interest that is required is lower.

I currently have capital one venture card with about 10k debt on it from a few years of school.  I was looking into a discover IT card that allows for debt consolidation and has a lower interest rate than my venture.  The capital one card is 12% interest and the discover card is 10% for 15 months.  I'd be saving a pretty penny for 1.25 years if I made the switch

personalfinance,Is it possible to extend the payback time on student loans and just really go hard on paying back one loan at a time?,"From simple calculations regarding paying back multiple loans, I've gathered that it is the best to pay back the loan with the highest interest rate on it while paying the minimum monthly payments on the others. 



For the default 10 year payback plan, the minimum monthly payment for 3 loans would be around $800+ a month (distributed among the 3 loans).


My mom called and was able to get the plan switched to a 25 year payback period where the monthly payment for the 3 loans would be around $400+ a month (distributed among the 3 loans).


My basic question is can't I just pay the minimum monthly payment on 2 loans while throwing much more than the minimum payment on the highest interest loan? I'm planning on throwing 2500 dollars a month towards loans to get them paid back within a few years. It would clearly be the best to keep this 25 year plan and throw minimum payments on the two lower interest loans until my highest interest loan is paid off.

MONEY

1. Savings: $8,000
2. A job starting in the fall of 2015 with a salary of $60,000 pre-tax.

1. How much should I be spending per month on food/housing/utilities?

2. What about other necessities, like health insurance, car insurance, gas (car is necessary for where I live) and retirement? My soon-to-be employer matches 6% of my contributions, but I think the employer contributions are only accessible after 4 years of full-time work, and most people in my field don't stay in that particular kind of place for 4 years. Is it worth it to make the full 6% contribution?

3. How much should I be saving each month vs putting into my loans?

4. Roughly how much should go to other expenses, like internet, cell phone, gas, entertainment, etc?

5. Are there any other things that I haven't thought of?

6. Is there any chance that I can pay off my loans within 5 years? (I realize that I'm most likely looking at 10 years, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway?)

Abstract: 

&gt; The paper builds a tractable model of patent pools, agreements among patent owners to license sets of their patents. It provides a necessary and sufficient condition for patent pools to enhance welfare and shows that requiring pool members to be able to independently license patents matters if and only if the pool is otherwise welfare reducing. The paper allows patents to differ in importance, asymmetric blocking patterns, and licensors to also be licensees. We undertake some initial exploration of the impact of pools on innovation. The analysis has broader applicability than pools, being arrangements

personalfinance,Right Ways to Save Income Taxes,"1. Check if you qualify for the earned income tax credit.

The earned income tax credit, which applies to low- and 

moderate-income taxpayers, can offer credit as high as 

$6,000. Karl Frank, author of the book, “Go Tax Free,” 

urges anyone earning less than $50,000 to investigate 

whether this credit applies to them; he qualified when he 

became a new parent, and he points out that many people 

qualify but don’t realize it they so lose out on the benefit.

2. Launch a business.

Becoming an entrepreneur can also improve your tax 

situation because business owners are able to take more 

control over how they pay taxes. They have the option of 

keeping more money in their company instead of drawing it 

down as income, and they can also count certain costs as 

expenses. (Tax professionals can help small business 

owners navigate the ins and outs of the Internal Revenue 

Service rules on eligible expenses, which are lengthy.)

**More Tips and Finance News are here &gt;&gt; www.news-g.com **

3. Take advantage of your children.

The tax code offers a handful of benefits to parents, 

including credit for child care costs, the child tax credit 

(worth up to $1,000 for each child under age 17 and phased 

out for high earners) and the ability to count more 

dependents in your household. Alimony payments are also 

tax deductible.

**More Tips on-- www.news-g.com **

4. Put money into college savings.

Just a small fraction of parents create 529 college savings 

accounts for their children, which means they miss out on 

the tax benefit of letting the money grow tax-free. As long 

as the money goes toward tuition, parents don’t have to 

pay taxes on the earnings. (They invest after-tax money.)

5. Keep your mortgage for as long as possible.

Mortgage interest payments are tax deductible, which 

means homeowners benefit, from a tax perspective, by 

keeping their mortgage for as long as possible (as opposed 

to paying it off early). Of course, you have to balance that 

tax benefit against the additional interest payments incurred, 

and the satisfaction of paying off the debt if you have the 

savings to afford to do so.

6. Save more money for retirement.

Voluntarily lowering your take-home paycheck by upping 

your retirement contributions might be painful in the short-

term, but it offers two benefits. First, you beef up your 

retirement savings, and second, you lower your tax burden. 

Money funneled into certain types of retirement accounts, 

including 401(k)s and IRAs, is tax deductible, within limits.

**More Tips take a look &gt;&gt; www.news-g.com **

7. Give more money away.

Charitable contributions aren’t the only type of tax-

deductible gift. Individuals can also receive up to $13,000 

without paying taxes, and parents can join forces to give 

each child $26,000 with a technique dubbed “gift splitting.”

8. Track medical expenses.

Certain health-related expenses, including acupuncture, 

supplies like bandages, and breast pumps are tax 

deductible. For a complete list of eligible items, visit 

irs.gov, and be sure to keep all receipts.

9. Become more energy efficient.

The federal government encourages taxpayers to make their 

homes more energy efficient by offering credits for a variety 

of moves, including installing insulation, new windows or 

doors, and qualified heating and cooling systems. Certain 

alternative energy sources, like solar panels, are also eligible 

for tax credits.

**More Tips and Finance News are here &gt;&gt; www.news-g.com **

10. Check for ordinary losses on stock losers.

Tax expert and U.S. News contributor Barbara Weltman 

says that while last year saw a lot of stocks go up, not 

every investment paid off. She points out that ordinary 

losses on the sale of stock can be deducted as capital 

losses, which can offset capital gains (including capital gain 

distributions from mutual funds) and up to $3,000 of 

ordinary income, or $1,500 for married couples filing 

separately.

11. See if you have any worthless securities.

Weltman says if you have a security that has become 

worthless – and it must be completely worthless, not just 

have filed for bankruptcy, for example – then you can 

deduct your loss. You treat the security as if you sold it on 

the last day of the year when it became worthless, she adds, 

and you have seven years to do so. That means you can 

check back for any securities that became worthless in 2006 

or later.

These tips should make it easier for you to maximize your 

deductions and avoid overpaying Uncle Sam.

**Current Situation**

* my mom has a $30,000 principal parent plus taken your for my freshman year 2010-2011. I have to pay her back for it once I pay off my own loans.
* I have a current principal of $7500 in federal loans + another $7500 coming over the course of this year
* I have about $5400 in credit card debt out of a total limit of $5800 since my loans haven't been enough to cover my expenses.
* legal resident of Virginia but I could easily establish residency in D.C. if needed

**Why I need another loan**

1) consolidate my credit card debt at a lower interest rate

2) cover my expenses for the rest of the year without credit card ($1050 per month rent, ~$150 per month utilities, ~$500-700 per month food, ~$300 per month entertainment)

3) finance a solo backpacking trip to Europe next summer before I start work. I estimate $1200 for flights, $1200 for hostels, $800 for transport, and $1200 for food + entertainment. Gonna round up to $5000 to be safe.

**Considerations**

* Don't have a job guaranteed yet. However, I anticipate being hired by the federal government at an initial rate of $55,421, starting at any time of my choosing between June and September of 2015. I would have a guaranteed (provided I meet basic expectations + no misconduct) promotion track to $75,621 over my first 2.5 years.
* My agency will repay up to $10,000 of my federal loans per year to a max of $60,000, knocking out my federal loans in 2 years.
* They will not be able to pay back the loan my mom took on my behalf.
* I plan to join the military reserves after I graduate for supplemental income + benefits.

**Where this leaves me**

I'd have to pay back whatever private loan I take out first, then pay back my mom's plus loan.

**Where I'm struggling**

**I've applied twice now for private loans from my credit union. They offer loans at 8.25-10.25% rates. I've been instantly declined both times. I have to put down my own information + rent ($1050 per month) and my mom as a cosigner. Her information for the loan app is listed below**

**Mom's situation:**

* $85,703 gross income for past 1 yr 1 month (they require listing previous employer if current is &lt; 2 yrs)
* $55,604 gross income for previous 11 yr 2 months
* $2450 per month rent + $3200 per month mortgage
* Not sure what her credit score is but my Dad has done a lot of damage to it over the past few years.

Dad is a depressed and alcoholic mess and was unemployed completely from fall 2010 to fall 2013, has been working as a substitute teacher from Fall 2013-present, as well as another part time job more recently with the local parks department doing maintenance. Not sure what his income is but it isn't anything great. He is blowing up their joint credit cards buying booze and dining out and she's stuck paying them off and paying the full mortgage ($3200 per month) so her credit doesn't get wrecked. They co-own the house and have realtors trying to sell it right now. Approximate market value is $828k from zillow. She moved out 2 months ago because up until then he refused to consent to a divorce, and in my home state the only way she can force the issue is with a full 12 months of separation, hence having to pay rent and mortgage simultaneously. She is drawing on their 401ks with penalties to cover expenses although I think they'll reach retirement age soon. Not sure what the timeline will be on the house sale.

**Help me**

Where should I look to get loans? How can I increase my chances of being approved? I have aunts and uncles who are very wealthy but I hate to ask them for help, but if it's worth it I'm willing to ask one of them to cosign for me.

If I have to drop the Eurotrip I won't be heartbroken, but if I'm able to get funds for it it would be 100% worth it to me. I estimate a $10,000-$15000 additional loan will cover my CC debt plus the trip. If I can take out more than that I'd like to so I can pay my mom cash to cover her plus loan. It'll be a higher interest rate but she needs the help as she has 2 kids in college (myself included) and 1 in high school.

**TL;DR: Senior in college. Got declined twice for additional student loans by my credit union. Need them to knock out substantial CC debt ($5400) and finance a trip to Europe next summer (est. cost $5000). Will be able to comfortably pay off my debts after I graduate, great employment outlook.

personalfinance,Using Student Loans to pay down Credit card debt.,"I checked the FAQ's and didn't see an answer to my question. 

Currently My wife and I have about $4500 in CC debt, $13k in student loans from my under grad and about $2000 in Medical Debt. My wife is in Grad school currently and has a full ride scholarship and currently has 0 student loans. I am currently working making about $50k (before taxes). We also have about $350.00 in savings. We are able to pay our bills on time but we are having a hard time getting our credit card debt down. I use YNAB and we try to stick to it but it seems like something always comes up. 


My question is: Should we take out a student loan to pay off the CC and Medical Debt? I was thinking that the lower interest rates on student loans could save us a lot of money while we pay it down. But, I am not sure if it is a good idea or not. 

Thanks in Advance


Edit: Thanks for the info. I definitely won't be pursuing this option. I didn't realize that student loan's couldn't be discharged in bankruptcy. Hopefully it won't come to that. We can still pay the minimums but I am just trying to figure out what the next step is.",finance,1415036621
personalfinance,To pay off low interest student loans or not,"Quick Profile:
Midwest area
About to graduate with a 62K starting salary in the IT Field. 

About $18,000 in Federal college loans. @3.4%-4.6% 
Which totals out to ~$180 a month. 

After taxes I believe I'll make around $1800 bi-weekly. I already have a Roth-IRA I've been contributing too. And a employee 401k which I have current access to as an intern. 

My rent expense will be around $600-750 (including utilities, etc) 
Car expense $300-400 (Including insurance, gas, payments, etc)
Food is around $200-300(I cook home mostly) 

My main goal is to live on half my salary. Which seems pretty possible even including my student loan payment. That means I'll have an extra $1800 (post-tax) to play around with. 

Question: Should I aggressively pay off the student loans?  OR try to put that money somewhere else where I can expect a higher return. 

If I aggressively pay back my loans I can knock them out less than a years time.

personalfinance,"How to prioritize my spending? 50k Income, 52k Student Loan, 3500 Credit Card, 24k Auto loan (USA)","Hi.

 I am 31. No real savings. Previous position only made about $36K and I was not able to save. My new position is $50K. Credit score is about 780. Will most likely see $70K to $80K income within 5 years (we hope). GF (future wife, maybe) makes about $60k and is much more frugal than I, and I don't expect her to contribute to my loans, but she is financially set.

**Expenses**

* Student loans: about 52K (fedloan) @ 6 - 6.8%
* Rent: Just under $400. Utilities are $50 (roommates)
* Credit Card: 0% until late next summer. $3500 Balance, ($85 minimum payment) (Discover IT card)
* Car Loan: $375 month (+$100 insurance). I live in snow and have a new base model AWD (Subaru, 2.9% APR)
* Fuel: ~$200 a month
* Food: $250 a month eating out, groceries $250 a month

* Cell phone: $68 month (Tmobile)

**Future expenses I know are coming next month**

* Medical / Dental: $1000
* Last semester of Grad school: $5000

I have about $3800 in a 401K which I could pull out, but, it would cost me so much to do so (probably 30% loss).

Should I start paying my student loans or auto loan first? I could probably put about $500 - $800 monthly towards it if I am lucky, but I still need to pay my tuition in January and medical bills.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Outside advice on some financial decisions.,"**I’d like some outside advice, here’s our situation:**


My wife and I are in our early 30’s.  No debt, education or otherwise, we pay everything on credit cards and pay those off monthly.  We have perfect credit.


I make about $80k take home, fulltime job.  She makes around $40k take home, part time job. One of the two of us stays home with the kids so no childcare expenses - while the other works.  Our son is grade school, our daughter is 2 years old.  When both kids are in school (3 years from now) we will be looking at $100k for me (guaranteed raises), and $80k for her when she goes back to fulltime work, she has a lot of potential for advancement when she decides to be more committed to her employer.
We have full health insurance for the family. 


I have a solid pension.  She does not contribute to a retirement fund.


We have a savings of $10k (previously $50k, paid off a car), as primary bread winner I have AFLAC to cover off work injury. I have $500k life insurance, she has $250k.  As far as contingency goes we’re well covered.
Our mortgage principal Balance $430k @ 4.5%.  We currently pay $700 over every month, at this rate we will pay it off in about 20 years.  As we get pay increases we put more money into our mortgage to increase our principal.


We just received an inheritance of $120k.  There is a potential, decades down the line that we will inherit over a millions dollars and a number of commercial real estate buildings. We have never planned on getting anything from anyone, we never count on anything that hasn’t happened.


My wife was just diagnosed with a serious form of cancer, curable but there is a possibility for relapse in the years to come.


We’ve worked very hard to get to where we are when we were younger… and have always planned for the future.


**So here is my general plan:**


Pay off our house ASAP. No interest/debt makes the most sense to me. I can amortize the savings that will be had by paying our note down - bynot paying interest/mortgage payments the savings will be in the mid-hundreds of thousands, on top of the equity of the home.  I figure that when I receive a paycheck or a pension check it will be 100% mine to invest as I please with, whether that is in another property, or my children’s education, etc.


Don’t pay into a 401k or buy stocks.  I have no control over the market conditions, fee’s, or future federal tax liability (I feel the market is inherently rigged, that I will always be the dumb money,  and that by the time I’m ready to retire and pull out my money the tax rate/my income will be much higher that it currently is on a ROTH IRA).  I will only invest in the market under two conditions, if I have mad money, which should happen in my late 40’s to early 50’s.


When our first house is paid off, do one of two things.  Sell it at at as close to 100% equity as possible and roll that into our “final house” … or pay off the house we’re currently in and turn it into a rental; use our rental as an asset combined with my pension and our paychecks to quickly pay off our “final house”.
When the kids hit college age in ~15+ years they can go to community college like their mother and I did - on their own dime, just like we did. They can live at home if they are studious and responsible.  The caveat is if they are excellent students and show promise/dedication to their chosen study. If that is the case then we will assist with tuition at a larger university, we will also assist if they complete their community college studies and wish to transfer to a university.


**Ultimate Goal:**


To do the best to raise our children to be as responsible in life and with money as we have been. To be debt free. To travel, while young and healthy. 


I’d like to retire at 53, get a part time job in another life of work. Her, to work whatever hours that she wants, and eventually when we’re done working, live in a home that we own outright with assets/pension supporting our life and travel. 


**Problem:**


My wife’s cancer diagnosis changes priorities for me, and her.  We’d like to experience more travel sooner, which translates to less assets later – I feel that all of our planning will be for naught if the cancer does come back and shit goes wrong 5 years from now (yes it sounds pessimistic- but I always plan for the worst hope for the best).  At least if we travel now we’ll have had good experiences/memories with the kids.


The inheritance of $120k can accelerate our ultimate goals, but also provides us the ability to travel, something we’ve yet to do in our lives.  We are doing a $30k remodel - so she’ll stay in the home longer, (which in turn allows us to pay down more equity on the note, also slightly increasing our home value)… I’d like to take a good portion of it and pay down the mortgage so we can have this thing paid off sooner. And take a portion to do some travel after her cancer is in remission.

personalfinance,Shorter Mortgage Term VS Long term Investing,"Opinions please ! 

We're buying a house but are unsure whether to go 30 yr or 15 yr term. Fiscally we are good, putting 25% down and earn enough to afford either loan term. The question is whether to

1. Pay off the house faster by taking a 15 year term -or-
2. Take a 30 year term and investing the monthly remainder from mortgage payments into index funds.

To think with actual numbers, we have about $330 remaining a month if we go 30 year term. The house costs around $200K, putting down $50k, getting 3.25% 15 yr or 4% 30 yr. I expect a 7% rate of return on investments. We make around $140k pretax as a couple. 

I'm assuming we hold on to the house for 15 years, even if we move out, its a good place to rent out. If we did end up buying a larger house in ~7 years, we would have enough savings to provide another down payment without selling this house and keep this as an investment property.

Of course, I guess we could refinance when we move out as an investment property, but I don't think it's wise to expect these kind of interest rates in the future. Also, we don't have kids, but when we do, the lower monthly payments may help I guess ? We're pretty fierce with actually saving up, so I don't doubt that we will invest the remainder instead of spending it. We'll just add it to our regular investments.

This question is related solely to improving credit with that in mind, and I do not address any other aspect of our finances. DH=husband and DW=wife.

Our credit scores are as follows, with no negatives except an 08/2013 30-day-late for DH on one card. 

&amp;nbsp;



MYFICO: DH: 637 EQ, 634 TU, 677 EX (does not have the one 30daylate); DW: 659 EQ, 670 TU,669 EX.  

&amp;nbsp;

We'd like to try to raise this, obviously.

It appears that the one 30-day late is not amenable to removing it for whatever reason, so that leaves us with paydown and credit limit increases as mechanisms to use here, we believe.

We have ~26,000 in balances on 20 credit cards between us, including 6 store cards.  Limits total ~30,000.  

One of those cards has ~900 balance and DH closed to keep a very low interest rate - how is the prior 2,000 limit treated for utilization? I included the balance but NOT the credit limit in the above numbers to give a more conservative estimate. 
 
We have ~300,000 combined student loans, paying $525 a month total.  We are not going to touch those, they are fine where they are (consolidated, IBR).  Paying ~$850 a month on the cards now (just made a couple of paydowns so need to recalculate once new statements show up).  No other debt, so total debt payments ~$1375/mo.

&amp;nbsp;
 
 
**We have ~$6,000 cash NOW to pay down cards.  Should we pay the highest utilization or highest payment?  Either way we will focus on DH's cards to improve his scores.  We will also try to get credit limits increased if we can do so without hard inquiries, to get a better utilization and improve scores.  Is there any difference between paying on authorized user cards (does benefit accrue to both?)  Is there any reason to pay store cards before OR after others?** 

We would typically just pay down the highest interest first, but in this situation we are willing to pay extra interest in order to have a quicker impact on credit scores.

So earlier this year I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I've recently landed a job as a software engineer at the same company my father works at and am wondering what would be the best way to utilize my income. The only debt I have is about $50,000 in student loan debt at an interest rate of roughly 5%. 

I plan on living with my parents until I'm 26 (but am willing to live at home longer) so I plan on pitching in $500/month towards utilities/groceries just to say thanks (they don't want me to, though). Parents recently bought me a new SUV that I plan on driving the wheels off of, so no car expenses.

My personal financial goals: Get rid of my student loan debt, Max out my 401k contributions, and possibly own my own home close to my parents free and clear by age 30 (I have a girlfriend who's still in college, but marriage isn't in the picture for either of us until that age). Retire before my mid 50s.

Given my current financial situation, what do you think is the best course of action that I could take?

I looked into consolidating and I'm not sure it's a great idea (correct me if I'm wrong). The WA interest rate of my loans current come to 6.39% and if I consolidate, my interest rate will be at 6.5%.

As for my financial situation: I make ~$48,000 a year. I expect a +$4,000 raise a year in the next three months. My current loan payment is $635/mo. Rent is $550. Utilities ~$70-100.

I have ~$4,000 in savings which generally stays around the same amount per month. I would say with all my expenses and salary, I'm staying about even since my savings is not growing or shrinking.

My questions:

* Should I still consider consolidating my loans?
* It seems like the 6.5% is a rip off. If I setup auto pay now, they offer a 0.25% reduction in interest rates. I've heard if you do that, they pay off the lowest interest rate loans first, so it sounds like a bad idea. I'm not sure if that offer stands after (if) I consolidate; if so, sounds like a good deal.
* Should I maintain my current high payments, regardless of my decision to consolidate?
* $635 is very high and at that rate I'm unable to save at the rate I would like. Considering my wage is expected to increase over time, is it a good idea to lower payments to say $400 while I'm still making a relatively low wage, then increase upon raises?
* Can you recommend readings that might benefit me and my situation?
* Any other advice for my financial situation?

I have a grace period until Jan. but since I'm doing ok with money with my new job so I want to start paying it back sooner rather than later.

When I made my first monthly payment  of $860 last month (which is what they will require as a monthly payment after my 6 month grace period) I noticed the payment was distributed seemingly randomly across the 6 loans with one account getting only $70 where another one got over $500 and the others got somewhere in between. When I just logged onto the site tonight I realized that you could choose which loan to make a payment to, so I'm looking for advice as to which of the accounts I should focus on more, or if I should just give them a lump payment and let them distribute it.  Below I have listed each Loan (A-F) the interest rate, balance, and put the interest they have accrued in parenthesis.

personalfinance,Student Loans and Divorce are crushing my finances - am I a good candidate for Chapter 13?,"Hi All - using a throwaway account, as this is a situation I'm not entirely proud of, though I'll try to provide as much detail as is possible.

I'm a college graduate with both a Bachelors and Masters degree in a relatively low paying field (music performance), and through various means - poor financial choices (borrowing too much damn money for college), dream chasing, and choice of school (I had other, lower cost options), wound up graduating college with a whopping $165,000 in student loan debt.  My loans are a mix of Federal &amp; Private ($65K &amp; 100K respectively), and through my first few years after graduation I managed to barely scrape by, by way of a mix of minimum payments and forebearance.  I am still working in my field, but I'd also managed to carve out a second career in a very well paying industry that made repayment somewhat manageable.  That was, unfortunately, until this year.

I won't go to deep into the weeds, but I'm in the middle of a divorce, and child support has taken my solid monthly income down to a level where repayment is barely possible.  I'm also managing a rather hefty credit card debt load (roughly 8K), and after the standard 20% is taken every month I'm left in the negative, with no savings to lean back on.  This is making is impossibly hard to keep up with payments to my attorney AND continue making regular payments on my loans.  

Forebearance is all but gone at this point, and I really don't have much, if any options to defer my loans any longer.  About 20K of my private ed loans are co-signed by my parents, the rest are held through my own credit - which after this year, has been significantly impacted due to my reduced income and inability to keep up with many payments.

Going back to school isn't really an option, nor would it be much help, since I'm already working two jobs.  I'm looking into whether a Chapter 13 Filing may help easy my cash flow and help me get caught up on my attorney fees, but I'm concerned that my parents (recently retired) would be impacted by the filing.  

Can anyone chime in and provide some solid advice?  Please help!",finance,1415079130
personalfinance,"Apply for CC via pre-approval code, or as fresh website application?","I've been receiving a TON (like, every other day) of pre-approval notices for the Capital One Quicksilver card in the mail, and it's something I'd like to take them up on.

I've noticed though a few differences between what appears when I enter my pre-approval codes, and what is shown if I open up a fresh application on their website. Specifically:

**Fresh application:**

* Interest rates are shown as a range

* $100 sign-up bonus

* $3000 minimum credit limit in the small print

**Pre-approval:**

* Specified APR

* No sign-up bonus mentioned

* $500 minimum credit limit in the small print

My question is whether there is any benefit or risk in using one application vs the other? Obviously the bonus and minimum limit for the regular application are more enticing, however I'm worried that I might be more likely to get rejected that way, versus using the 'in' that the pre-approval offers, even though the application is for the same card and my application itself would be identical.

personalfinance,"My grandfather passed away recently, and I think my aunt is attempting to misrepresent and effectively steal a large portion of the inheritance away from my father and his siblings","Hi everyone, kind of been lurking this sub for awhile (managed to save up to a $3k emergency fund and am currently debt free), and I figured this might be the place to get some more information about my situation. I'm missing a lot of information simply because it has not been given to my dad, so I can really only provide what I know and ask for help in relation to that.  
 
So here's the situation: According to my dad, grandpa had a large amount of money spread across several checking and savings accounts, and several CDs worth anywhere from $5k-$20k each. We're talking about a couple hundred thousand dollars, and the value of his house. Grandpa died about 7 months ago. One Aunt (I'll call her Mary) was named executor of his will/estate. Another Aunt (Jane) was named co-executor. Dad and his 3rd sister were not given executor status or anything else, that I know of. 
  
Mary is taking far too long to deal with the situation, spreading out a couple of bank visits and notarization of some legal documents over the course of the 7 months since he died. My dad is getting fed up with this to the point that he is losing sleep and appetite. Dad, Jane, and the other sister have repeatedly tried to get Mary to speed up the process, or even give them the materials so Jane can handle it. Mary refuses to give up any of the bank statements or legal documents so Jane can file everything with the bank and so on. We strongly suspect Mary is trying to keep some sum of money hidden from the rest of the family. 

My question is this: What can my dad, or at the very least Jane, do about this? Is there a cheap solution? Short of physically going to the house and taking the documents (which none of them are able to do, nor do they want to do that), I can't think of anything short of paying tons of money for a lawyer to get it all sorted out, but my dad wants to wait til AFTER she eventually files everything before attempting that route.

I really just want to help my dad out, I'm tired of seeing him lose sleep and not be able to eat at his age. This is tearing him apart and we don't know what to do. Sorry if this post isn't really appropriate here, I couldn't find anything against it. I'll add any information as I get it, or answer any questions as best as I can.",finance,1415080066
personalfinance,Just when I think I am settling I get into something ..,"I am 32, make a little under 100k a year. I built a house from the country I am all paid for which is fetching a monthly rental of $600/month and that will continue to increase each passing year. The money collected goes directly into a 9% CD or a Fixed deposit investment in a local bank (blame the inflation).

I put 24k in 401k + 3k company contribution, 21k an ongoing mutual fund.

I drive a 90k mile car which I bought at an auction cost me 10k after some maintenance and got a bank loan at 1.25% interest for 50 months. 

I have a 5k in emergency fund which I don't touch (basically to buy air tickets if there is a family emergency).

So whats the problem.. I am committed to a relationship now soon will be getting married. My Fiancee has around 100k in student + car loans.
Car loan I am not too worried about the interest rate is cheap. But student loan is daunting.

I am okay helping my fiancee with the loans from what I save monthly which is around $600, once we get married, I plan to pay rent and she will save the rent money and put towards all her loans. She makes a little over 45k.

here is the strategy, heads down, she puts 2k/month and we will be out of debt in 4 years. 2k / month will save her another 300-400 for her monthly expenses. I am very committed to help her out of debt.

I have always lived in poverty and by age 30 I worked hard, saved well , but my struggles don't end. The house I built was for my parents, so I got to build one more in USA. So after 4 years, I will start working on house, between now and 4th year I will have a baby or two and more expenses, and then house mortgage, school, college...

Just hate budgeting. have been doing it all my life but man I hate budgeting. 

sometime I want to start my own company, but my ideas are useless and I am scared that I will die budgeting all my life.

investing,Understanding The Basics of The Thrift Savings Plan,"Most people that work for the federal government have a basic idea of what a Thrift Savings Plan is. However, investing for retirement can be difficult regardless of the particular type of plan that is used. As a result, it is important to understand the basics of a Thrift Savings Plan, more commonly referred to as the TSP. Things like TSP allocations and TSP investing are important to understand. It is also important to understand how this type of plan is related to a traditional 401(k) retirement plan.

The Basics
The basics of a Thrift Savings Plan are fairly straightforward. People that are eligible for this type of plan must work for the government and they can join immediately upon being hired. Individuals are currently able to contribute as much as $17,500 a year to their TSP account. This is limited by the maximum amount of money that the Internal Revenue Service will allow to be contributed to any retirement account. The Thrift Savings Plan does allow individuals to contribute the maximum amount allowed by the IRS. As a result, this amount can fluctuate depending on current IRS regulations. The best part about it is that the money that is contributed to the TSP account is not taxed, allowing individuals to contribute slightly more than $17,000 a year free of taxes. Furthermore, the government will match the amount of money that is contributed by the employee. Typically, the amount that is matched dollar for dollar is approximately 2% but in some cases, more money can be contributed by the government as long as a greater percentage is contributed by the individual employee. For individuals that qualify and that contribute an amount that corresponds accordingly, the government may contribute as much as 5% to the account on an annual basis. In addition, individuals can sometimes have more than one TSP account. For example, a person that has previously worked as a uniformed officer and now works in another capacity for the federal government can actually have two separate ESP accounts that work independently from each other.

TSP Allocations During Employment
One of the most unique things about a Thrift Savings Plan is that TSP allocations can be accessed during employment, through loans and withdrawals. Employees have the opportunity to withdraw certain funds from their TSP account while they are employed in order to cover additional expenses that they may have for things such as major home renovations, auto repairs or anything else that incurs an unexpected expense on their part. By the same token, they may also qualify for loans that are based on the money that is in the TSP account. While they still have to pay the money back, this can be far more convenient than having to get a loan through some other resource in order to get the amount of money that is needed to pay for something unexpected.

TSP Investing
TSP investing is rather flexible, providing a wide range of opportunities for individuals to find a method of investing that works well for them. When it comes to personal investing, there are five different individual funds that can be accessed.

The I Fund, as it is known, is used to invest in the International Stock Index
The S Fund is used for Small Capitalization Stock
The G Fund is utilized to invest in Government Securities
The C Fund is for the Common Stock Index
The F Fund is the Fixed Income Index
Individuals also have the opportunity to invest with Lifecycle Funds. These funds are tailored towards individuals planning on beginning their retirement on a set date. Once the individual choses the fund, they are suppose to set it and forget it. The portfolio is allocated among the 5 individuals in order to provide the optimal portfolio.

During Retirement
When a person that has a TSP account makes the decision to retire, there are several options available. The money can be rolled over into a traditional IRA account. In this respect, a TSP account is much like a traditional 401(k). Furthermore, an individual has the option of receiving a single lump sum payment from their TSP account or they can receive monthly payments for a predetermined amount of time. It is up to the individual to determine the best method to receive payments from their account during their retirement. In addition, the amount of money that is available will depend largely on the type of investing that a person has done throughout their career and how much money has been made from those investments.",finance,1415086135

personalfinance,Can we get some non-US centric advice for investing,"I know reddit's community is mostly american, and this is usually fine in most subreddits, but it really gets frustrating in /r/personalfinance.

The most common pieces of advice around here seem to be:

 - Invest for retirement in a 401k, IRA plan
 - Pay off your student loans
 - Don't get into debt or pay them when first when they start smothering you.

I agree, it's great general advice, but it does not transpose necessarily well in all cases. For instance, not all countries have retirement schemes, some countries have free education and usually, the debt-centric system is much worse in the US than anywhere else (don't have credit history in my country and debit cards instead of credit cards).

My money is split between 2 countries, the one I was born in and the one I am currently living in. The one I was born in has little to no investment schemes like the 401k, so that's not an option. The one I am working in has 0 interest rates so no saving account, near-0 retirement option (you can put aside about $100 a month, invested in really crappy funds which loose money more often than not and it's closer to a racket than anything else).

As a result, I now have ~100k which I have no idea how to invest. My employer is not providing any realistic option for saving up for retirement, my bank offers nothing but time deposits which loose money over inflation (~4-6% p.a.).
What should I do? 

I can't invest in real estate as the market is overblown and in a fully fledged bubble. Stock market has never been so high but might also be about to crash. Bonds are loosing over inflation.

Right now, I'm witnessing my savings beeing eaten by inflation every year and I don't know what to do, short of investing in risky assets.

I had hoped /r/personalfinance would be of some help, but reading through the FAQ and top thread, I see next to nothing that applies to my situation...

What would you do in my situation, apart from posting a desperate-sounding thread to a subreddit visited by people in a much worse situation than mine? (shouldn't be complaining as I have some money, I guess...)

EDIT: thank you very  much to those who participated. I did not expect this subject to be very welcome here, but I didn't expect the downvoting to oblivion. I guess this is probably only helping the point I was trying to make about this subreddit. Shame, really...",finance,1415100373
personalfinance,"Recovering from financial hardships, looking to consolidate credit card debt without taking a major credit hit. What are my options?","Long time lurker, ready for some advice.  My wife and I have $25,000 in credit card debt that we racked up a few years ago while I was changing careers and going to school.  I'm 2 years into my much more lucrative and stable career, and we're ready to eliminate some accounts.  Here's our financial situation.

My wife makes about $70,000 per year with an additional $10,000 per year ""bonus"" that her employer applies to her student loans on a per-month basis.  We bought our house while I was unemployed and still with a poor credit rating, so she is on the mortgage alone.  We currently owe $103,000 on a house worth approximately $115,000.  She still has about $85,000 across several student loans, which she does not pay, but no lending agency will acknowledge the 10k per year her employer pays towards the loans, and consider her on the hook for the monthly payments when considering income to payment ratios.  She also has about $1500 left on an auto loan which will be paid off in a month or two.  about half of the $25,000 credit card debt is solely in her name, while we are both on for the rest.  Her credit rating is about 670, with a lot of history and a lot of debt.

I make approximately $50,000 per year.  My current debt is approximately $12,000 in credit card debt jointly with my wife, about $1,500 on my own, $8000 on one student loan, and I owe about $18,000 of a $20,000 auto loan, which was the first loan I was able to acquire on my own. My credit rating is approximately 690 with good but scanty recent history, and several small collections that were paid but unremoved from my report more than 8 years ago.  

Our current problem is that we are trapped with so many different payments, and the credit card debt is carrying high interest rates, and even though we can contribute more than minimums, we really aren't making any dents in the actual balances.  

We don't have much to use as collateral in a personal loan except a little equity in the house and our car that's nearly paid off.  Our other expenses include a toddler and a newborn, and it seems like every time I build any kind of an emergency fund we have to tap it for an unexpected expense and I'm back to square one.  We've discussed taking a loan from her 401k to pay off the credit cards, but the fees/taxes scare us.  Reducing the number of accounts we have active is our #1 priority right now, and would also like to see lower interest rates so we can pay the same amounts each month and drop the balance faster without taking a major hit to our credit rating.

What are our options?",finance,1415100816

Forex,What do you think GBP/JPY will do next?,"So last week I bought GBP/JPY @174.39 at the 50% retracement of the sept 20 high, hoping for a bounce to the 78.6% level @177.97. 
BOJ released their new and unexpected monetary policy last friday which cause the sterling/yen to shoot up and I ended up selling @180.02 for a 563 pip gain.

[See for yourself on the daily chart](http://i.imgur.com/zkWy3cu.png?2)

My question is now that it's [consolidating](http://i.imgur.com/cDUGETD.png?1) (as you can see on this 1h chart) after shooting up hundreds of pips, that yen fundamentals are weak and is expected to continue to decline throughout the rest of Q4 and Q1 2015, is it just taking its breath for its next run to the 127.2%(184.14) level or will it fall down to lower retracements until an eventual reversal?

If you look on the [monthly chart](http://i.imgur.com/VUg3kqL.png?1), it seems to in an uptrend from the 2012 low of 116.66, with support confirmed at 38.2%(168.11) retracement. Am I correct to assume the next target is the 50% (183.96) level (which is 18 pips from the 127.2% (184.14) retracement on the daily chart)??

personalfinance,Student Loans Broken Into 10 Different Accounts. 2 Late Payments Dinged My Credit 10 Times Each. Advice Would Be Appreciated,"Hi all. I have almost a six-figure federal loan from Nelnet that I have been paying on for a couple of years now (terrible I know). Late last year, I hit some hard times and missed a couple of payments (again, terrible, I know). Because my Nelnet account is split 10 different ways, they hit my credit 10 different times for each late payment, resulting in 20 negative statements on my credit for only 2 actual missed payments. 

I tried to work with Nelnet to consolidate those late payments into just two, but they were unwilling to work with me on that. After some more research, I ended up disputing the late payments with the three bureaus. My justification simply asked that they consolidate the missed payments down to the two that actually occurred.

Last week, I received a statement from Equifax saying that the account information on my Nelnet accounts had been updated, which I thought was good news, but further inspection showed that all the late payments were still present.

Fast forward to today when I checked my credit report on CreditKarma to see that the late payments with Nelnet had ballooned from 20 to 40. Additionally, my recorded payment history went from something like 650 down to 447 payments on file. 

How is this possible? The adviser at Nelnet suggested I consolidate, which would not take care of anything in the past, but might look good on my credit report. Essentially, those accounts would be closed down and a new one opened up. Can't this hurt me?

I am now in a great financial position, but I'm being smothered by the mistakes of my past. I want to buy a house and start progressing a little bit, but I'm stuck. What can I do? I'm lost.

Thanks for reading. Any advice is welcome.",finance,1415118866
personalfinance,My to-be American fiancee's $400k student loans,"I've been dating my gf for over a year now and we're both in our early 30s. She's American and I am in the country on a work permit for my job. Considering things between us were going extremely well, we began to talk about marriage and I started to consider living in the States on a more permanent basis.


I've recently discovered she has student loans from her undergraduate and medical school graduation, that have been sitting unpaid in a forbearance state and have now ballooned into a massive $400,000 sum total, once consolidated into a single federal loan. She is set to finish her residency next year and does not have a job lined up as yet. Once she does get a job, she's looking at a starting pay for $60-80k. She is however in a very specialized field of medicine that has very few job openings from what I can tell.


My financial situation on the other hand is fairly straight-forward - I have zero debt and I also own nothing of great value in this country, besides my car. I have job that pays me $120-140k and currently keeps me comfortable in my no-debt situation (i.e. I have the means to buy a home etc. when I want to). Note, I also live in an area where a 6-figure income is very commonplace and really not as much as it sounds. 


Me learning so late in the game of my gf's loans has our relationship in a strain, simply because I'm unable to wrap my head around how I'm going to pay of a $400k loan thats growing at 7% every year. I've looked into all sorts of loan forgiveness programs but those go as far as making monthly payments for 10-25 yrs (depending on public vs pvt employment) and leave you with a massive tax bill from the IRS at the end of the forgiveness. Does reddit have any advice for me?





EDIT: Thanks for the extremely helpful responses! I've added some more info after further research on my end:


* Her starting pay will be $55-60k for a fellowship, and closer to $100-120k after that (assuming her secures full time employment after the fellowship)


* Medical specialization is Podiatry (DPM). On talking to other medical professionals in the area and running job searches, there seem to very few openings in our region, due to a saturation of similar specialists.


* We are considering IBR (Income-Based Payments) and seeking loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for 10-yr public service. Still confused about the tax burdens in the 10th year.


* Question now is - How does a combined salary of &gt;= $200k go about paying off a $400k loan @ 7%, while also hoping to purchase a first home, etc.",finance,1415119054

personalfinance,"""Single"" homeowner(28M) looking to consolidate debt. What are your suggestions?","I have a home that I bought 3.5 years ago, it was a foreclosure and I stumbled upon a fantastic deal while apartment hunting (101K home for 81K). I was more than financially stable up until February (when I stopped receiving 20+ overtime hours a week) because business slowed. Regardless of slow business, I know I am completely secure at my company, considering I don't change my work ethic. However, since losing that overtime I have come to a point where i am scraping the bottom of the barrel every month. Down to the nitty gritty...

-My monthly income after taxes is $2,600, without overtime
-My monthly expenses are approximately $2400, In my expenses I have factored in everything (needs and also credit lines)

Debts I owe are (rounded up):
-Mortgage = $740/mo ($69K @ 4% with 27 years left)
-Car = $440/mo ($13K @ 5% with 28 months left)
-Credit Line 1 = minimum $35 ($1300 @ 24%)
-Credit Line 2 = Minimum $35 ($1200 @ 24%)
-Credit Line 3 = Minimum $25 ($750 @ 18%)

I would like to consolidate these loans, excluding my mortgage, into one lower interest rate (preferably fixed) and more manageable payment. I do not have a credit card that I use actively. Each of those credit lines were for items I needed at the time and did not have the cash (ie. new furnace). I do not foresee needing to pay for anything on credit and have no interest in doing so in the future (until I have the debt completely paid off, a nest egg, and emergency savings built up... then maybe). 

I want to go back to school but I don't want to incur school loans with other debts hanging over me.

I have been in a relationship for a while with a single mom, whom is financially stable, and I would like to clear this debt before we take things to the next level.

My questions:

- if the current tenant's lease payment greatly exceeds the sum of: the mortgage payment I can get with current interest rates plus a property management fee plus utilities, isn't this a no-brainer?

- if I purchase it as a private individual, will it suddenly be assessed and due taxes, or as long as it is zoned ""religious"" will it be prop. tax free?

personalfinance,Back to School (for Adults!) Planning,"Heyo. Okay, I know PF likes some delicious bullet points, so here:

* My student loan 1: $407.39 @ 6.8%
* My student loan 2: $1,654.86 @ 3.4%
* My take home pay: $1,704.75 per month - **CHANGING** in January to $1,537.98 because I will be eligible for:
* My company retirement match: 9% for my 6% - Currently at $0.00 retirement savings cause I dumped money into my student loans while I was ineligible for matching.
* No other debts (no CC payments or cars or w/e).

* Husband student loans (I think 11?) totaling about $25,000, IBR of $230/month. I am sitting down to review that break down with him this evening and put the individual loans in our YNAB.
* Husband take home pay varies from $450-$600 a check - avg. $1,100 per month ($10/hr).
* Husband putting in 3% to get company match of 1.5%. Currently at about $1,000.
* Various old debts that are past statues of limitations and coming off the credit reports this spring. He fixed this behavior before we met and stopped using a credit card for anything, but he is less financially literate than I am. BUT he is happily on board with w/e budget I put into YNAB and follows it on his phone, so we are okay there.

* Expensive east coast city 
* No savings ATM - bought our Honeymoon trip and then had major dental surgery emergency right after. &gt;.&lt; Promise I am working on it, as it is giving me a heart attack.
* We use YNAB and are being frugal to try to get some savings back.

So anyway, we are looking towards the future and trying to put ourselves in a better position. Husband does not have a degree even though he has all those loans. He was the first person in his family to go to college, struggled with a lot of personal issues and such, and ended up bailing half way through. Currently he works in retail, and he reallllly hates it as he wants a structured schedule. He is very good at sales and customer service though.

We have decided he will go back to school at the local community college to get his Associates. This will cost us about $150 per credit, which is not bad. He needs 42 more credits or about $6000 total for the Associates. An Associates from the community college guarantees him admission to the state college nearby to finish his degree. Tuition there is about $15,000 per year. I work in higher education and in 3.5 years he would be eligible for free tutition at my job place, IF I still work there and IF he gets accepted. These are not guarantees, but are a possibility.

Now questions:

So we are thinking he will enroll at half time so he can continue to work. This will allow him to put his loans on deferment. We want to continue to pay money towards his student loans while they are in deferment to help us get ahead on them. Am I correct in thinking it is best to pay off on the unsubsidized loans during this time because they are still accruing interest? If we paid $1000 down across 3 loans at the same interest rate, would it change anything vs paying off 1 loan at that interest rate entirely? Is there a special order we should do things in? 

Now Pell Grant stuff- you get up to 600% lifetime eligibility. AKA you can use the Pell Grants for 6 years. He is currently sitting at 400%. From what I understand, Pell Grants are pro-rated if you don't use 100% of your eligibility each year. So if he qualifies for $5000 and uses half, then he can use the other half the next year. Should we apply for the Pell Grants while he is at community college or save using them for when he transfers and try to pay out of pocket as we go? I feel like there must be some strategy here to the best way to use this money but I can't quite figure it out. What if my salary goes up over the next few years? Would that affect things?

Finally, he likes sales/customer service stuff but hates retail. He is hoping to major in Marketing &amp; Communications. I know people love to harp on the engineering majors, but it's really not for him. Is this a reasonable 'soft' degree for a middle class career, or are there some other options we should consider that are related but offer better opportunities?

I just feel all this anxiety about the future cause we need make changes to improve our prospects. I tend to get anxiety about money after growing up realllly poor and worrying about evictions and having enough food to eat. I am not sure if it's better for him to just take out more loans and finish school faster so he can make better money sooner, but I'm so scared of taking out MORE loans on top of everything and being the sole provider while he powers through school. Is there any logic to apply to this decision, or does it come down to personal comfort?

personalfinance,"Coming into some money, which loan should I kill?","I have about $7,000 coming to me at the end of this year as a gift from a family member. Terms are that I must use it to kill debt, and then whatever monthly payment is dissolved from paying that debt, the equivalent is rolled over to attack another loan (snowball/avalanche style). That's it, no other strings.

I have three major loan groups: 2 student loan groups and my car. I need help deciding which loan would be best to kill?

The Loans:

1. Direct Un/Subsidized Federal Loans -- $21,113 
  * Monthly $198.86 (I'm on the graduated repayment, so this will ramp up every 2 years)
  * Rate 6.55%
  * This is a consolidated group of 4: a $2K, $4K, $6K and a $8K
2.  State loans -- $8159 
  * Monthly $106
  * Rate 3.3%
  * Consolidated group of 2, each with about $4K
3. Car loan -- $6845.45
  * Monthly $212
  * Rate 4.29%

I'm leaning toward paying off the car loan for two reasons: the monthly payment is the biggest (thus, will have a major effect if I roll it over to something else) and the car is worth about $2000 less than what's left on the loan now. 

My family member is leaning toward having the money to go toward the federal stuff, but is open to that.

personalfinance,Attacking student loans with forgiveness program.,"Hi there, I have been reading people's situations on personal finance and have found them very informative. I want to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program where if you make 120 payments while working for a public service (non profit, educational institution etc.) your loans get paid off after that 120th payment (whatever is left over). 

I am seeking some advice...

I have $82,000 in federal loans and around $24,000 in private loans. The private can't be touched by the PSLF program, I know that. But the federal loans can be (they are all direct stafford). 

I currently work at a for profit institution making $50k and I am on the ICR plan. My payments are roughly $638 / month (+ $250 for private). 

I am wondering if at this point I should simply ditch this job (which I really don't like anyway) and find a job for a non-profit institution (most likely making way less) in an effort to be qualified for the Loan Forgiveness Program. 

I work in counseling/academic advising so doing that at a big public institution where I live could be a possibility also and i would still have a decent salary. 

I guess my thought is, the loans are going to sap my discretionary income anyway, as ICR and IBR are a % of your income, so what does it matter if my salary is 35k or 50k (as long as I can live within my means)? I'd rather be able to have my loans forgiven after 10 years (120 payments) than have to pay them all off in 25 years by myself...

Thoughts??? Thanks all. 

**UPDATE** Thanks for your insights. I think the answer may be...get a job at my local state school with a stellar reputation and great pay/benefits. It could be awhile before I get it as it is a prestigious school, but I think that would kill two birds with one stone: high salary and takes advantage of PSLF.",finance,1415143080

personalfinance,Where to begin,"Hey r/personalfianance,

I’ve spent the last 5 years staying in debt, ruining my credit and somehow I don’t have anything to show for it. I have no savings and an income of $2300.00 a month, with a stipend and a part time job.  I’m not proud of my past actions, but I’m trying to steps in the right direction. I can really use your help on how I should proceed.

I have the following debts:
-$16,000.00 in federal 3 Stafford Loans from undergraduate in deferment until April 2015. Loan 1 at $3,500 at 2.3% interest and loan 2 and 3 totaling $12,500 6.5% interest
-$5,500.00 from charge off from credit card 1 (2011) and $8,300.00 from charge off from credit card 2 (2012. Clearly, I was reckless those years)

I spent the last 1.5 years in a master’s of science that I will complete in April 2015. The master’s was covered by scholarship, I’m 27 and will most likely will continue with school with the goal of obtaining a PhD in 2018. I would most likely bring in $2700 a month, but the thought of having no emergency money/savings and poor credit has me thinking about what is the best course of action.

I browsed r/personalfianance for similar situations and advice, and I decided to really transform my budget to spend as little as possible each month. I also began to take on as many hours at the part time job as possible. It’s a start but I have a long way to go. Any others tips? Also, where is this “extra” money best utilized? Should I try to resolve the charge-offs and repair credit? All help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!",finance,1415144698
personalfinance,In a tight spot,"Due to me not knowing much about personal finance, I have gotten myself into a hole. I currently owe $24,500 to my bank for student loans, $8,000 to the federal government also for student loans, $3500 to another bank for CDL training, and $4000 on my car.

Each month, I pay 
$320 to the bank for student loans
$298 for my car
$154 to the federal government
$119 for insurance
$250 for the loan for CDL training
$70 for a loan my mom got for me to make a down payment on the loan for the CDL training

I currently make about $450 a week, which means all of my extra money after the loans (if any) goes towards food and gas to get to work, and if there is anything left after that, I have to give that to my parents as I'm stuck living at home (no money to live on my own) 

Is there anything I could do to try to dig myself out of this hole faster, or if there was any way besides bankruptcy that I could somehow get some breathing room so I can move out (24 years old and I would like to marry my girlfriend, but I cant do that until I'm able to live on my own). I feel like I just can't get ahead. I work hard, but don't make much money, and as I said, I know next to nothing about personal finance, so I don't know what routes there are for me to take to get out of this hole.

I would really appreciate any and all advice, because I'm kind of getting to the point where nothing looks like it's going to get better anytime soon.",finance,1415144845

* Enhanced nuclear safety?

Does the EU nuclear safety directive risk fragmenting international standards, asks Ana Stanic.

Seeking to strengthen nuclear safety standards in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident, in July this year the European Union amended the nuclear safety directive adopted in 2009.

Back then, adoption of the nuclear safety directive marked an important development in regulating nuclear safety. Building on the provisions of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, an incentive-only instrument, and the principles adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the EU became the first regional actor to adopt legally-binding nuclear safety rules. The 2009 directive granted the EU for the first time express competence in nuclear safety. Its adoption met, however, with strong opposition from industry and national regulators, which consider nuclear energy as falling within the purview of member states.",energy,1415145301

Also, what's the difference with discover and other cards? Is discover accepted at many places? Lastly is it possible to negotiate my current cards interest rate down once interest starts to be applied? (Sorry I know that's a lot of questions)",finance,1415162116
personalfinance,Advice for refinance from 30 year to 15 year,"Our lender has been pushing us new rates for refinancing, and we've been weighing to see if this is a good way to save money over the long term. I would love to have additional opinions for peace of mind.

We are 65 months into our 30 year loan. Amount was for 210k, with down payment of 60k. (Original amount financed was 147k. Rate at 5.633%) Current property value probably between 170 and 200.

We pay 1040.00 a month with taxes included, and would pay about 304-310k by the time the loan is fully paid.

We earn 4k monthly. No other debts.

They are offering these refinances:

30 year: Monthly payment 891.00 : Interest rate of 4.25

20 year: Monthly payment 1,061.00 : Interest rate of 4.125

15 year: Monthly payment of 1215.00 : Interest rate of 3.625

We are thinking of going with the 15 year and paying an extra 175 a month so we can pay off the loan 10 years faster. (And, if my math is correct pay around 88k less overall)

Now on to the specific questions;

1. Are these interest rates comparable to what we should expect, or should we shop around instead of letting our current lender make the offer?

2. Would it make more sense to keep the loan we have, or pick the 30 or 20 instead and simply make additional payments on the principal?

3. How much should the ""appraisal"" and out of pocket closing fees normally cost? $500+ seems a bit steep to pay out of pocket for just an appraisal and credit check.

4. Any tips or knowledge I should be aware of? I would like to be as informed as possible before I start making decisions.


Thank you for the counsel!

Bitcoin,Is this how short squeeze happens with Bitcoin?,"I understand that some companies allow you to deposit BTC at a decent interest rate. The companies in turn let people borrow those coins which they then sell. (It doesn't matter if you call this shorting although in effect that is exactly what it is, I think.)

If BTC drops, then those who have sold it can buy BTC and give them back to the lending companies and get their collateral back which would be USD.

But the companies are concerned about getting the BTC back and I guess are monitoring the value of the BTC borrowed vs the cash deposits.

I am guessing that the borrowers deposit quite a bit more in cash than the value of the coins borrowed. If this is true, what sort of margin is required? That is, say to borrow one BTC at 400 market price you have to deposit 800 USD.

What price would BTC have to move to so that the lender either requests more USD or buys coins on the market using the borrowers cash? Is it any movement against the borrower? Or would BTC price have to move say 10 percent against them?

EDIT: Are lenders concerned solely with last trade or do they take into account the average price during some period, etc.?",cryptocurrency,1415173670
personalfinance,"Considering refinancing my student loans. May be better for us now, but will it be worth it in the long run?","I'll try to provide as much information as possible without writing a novel here. I owe around $16k in student loans. I was living on the street last year after my husband lost both of his jobs and we were evicted for being habitually late on our rent. I was working, but supporting my husband and son while they stayed with family. Saved enough for an apartment and moved in 6 months ago. Right around the same time, my wages started being garnished. From what I understand, they take out a percent of whatever I make that pay period. 


It's killing us. Any overtime I get goes to loans. Any bonus I get goes to loans. I can still pay the rent and buy food, but there is no way Christmas is happening this year if I don't do something about these loans. 

Then I see my bank offers refinancing. I desperately need the lower monthly payments. However, I don't know how this will effect us in the future. I'll probably pay a high interest rate, but would the lower payments make it worth the interest?

I'll be happy to give any more information needed if I can. I no longer have any of the paperwork for my loans since all our belongings were tossed or sold when we couldn't afford storage.

Bitcoin,Checking GAW against the Securities and Exchange Commission list of Ponzi Red Flags.....,"I may be a bit slow but, finally, I'm getting suspicious and have begun to ask myself questions that, if I were smarter, I’d have asked before investing any money.  Like, is there any proof GAW miners is mining anything at all?  The answer to that is technically no, there isn't.  The question then becomes where are their payouts coming from then?  The official answer to this is that GAW make their money by renting out their mining power to private companies and it's this income that provides the customers with their ever diminishing payouts.  Though who these companies are is a mystery.  And, in any case, that seems like a peculiar business model.  Why isn't GAW’s business of the sort that its website and marketing implies it is?  i.e  a cloud mining service that mines bitcoin and sells shares of the mining power to customers.
The fact that the thing looks like a Ponzi scheme is inescapable.  A smart and more worldly person would probably have spotted that straight away.
 
 
How does slow witted person like me finally identify a Ponzi scheme then?  Well, he checks his experience against the US Securities and Exchange Commission list of Ponzi Scheme red flags:
 
 1. High investment returns with little or no risk. Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Be highly suspicious of any ""guaranteed"" investment opportunity.
  2. Overly consistent returns. Investment values tend to go up and down over time, especially those offering potentially high returns. Be suspect of an investment that continues to generate regular, positive returns regardless of overall market conditions.
   3. Unregistered investments. Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that have not been registered with the SEC or with state regulators. Registration is important because it provides investors with access to key information about the company's management, products, services, and finances.
  4.  Unlicensed sellers. Federal and state securities laws require investment professionals and their firms to be licensed or registered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.
   5.  Secretive and/or complex strategies. Avoiding investments you do not understand, or for which you cannot get complete information, is a good rule of thumb.
  6. Issues with paperwork. Do not accept excuses regarding why you cannot review information about an investment in writing. Also, account statement errors and inconsistencies may be signs that funds are not being invested as promised.
  7. Difficulty receiving payments. Be suspicious if you do not receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out your investment. Keep in mind that Ponzi scheme promoters routinely encourage participants to ""roll over"" investments and sometimes promise returns offering even higher returns on the amount rolled over.

Of course, GAW miners gets a few red flags but not across the board.  It didn’t necessarily promise ‘high’ returns – just consistent ones that were higher than you’d receive elsewhere.  Eventually these consistent and ‘higher than elsewhere’ returns became inconsistent and low.  A big red flag is the company being unregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission:      
 
 
3.12 GAW as defined herein  is not engaged in providing investment products, regulated commodities, or financial products of any type or kind.  GAW is not registered as a securities broker-dealer or an investment adviser either with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or with any state securities regulatory authority, and does not offer any product or service based upon the sale or acquisition of securities or derivative based products or services. GAW is neither licensed nor qualified to provide investment advice and you are specifically and adamantly advised not to rely upon anything posted/communicated/implied or expressed by GAW. - From the GAW Miners Terms and Conditions


So, it certainly is unregistered and unlicensed.  The fifth red flag is particularly interesting – GAW does indeed appear to have a secretive and/or complex strategy. Far more complex and secretive than you’d think a cloud mining service needs to be.  One that involves renting out mining power to unknown private companies, making payouts based on pool estimates rather than actual payments from mining, mysterious negotiations that involve over-the-horizon promises just as soon as they’re completed and a very strange ‘store credit’ type scheme in which, if we stick with the company and mine 'hashpoints' we'll be, one day, much rewarded with 'hashcoins' which will be very, very valuable. 

Issues with paperwork?  There isn’t any paperwork.  I suppose this is an advantage of selling mining shares as if they are property rather than a contract which would necessarily involve a contract. 

Finally, difficulty receiving payments.  There have, I believe, been a fair few people who’ve had difficulties with withdrawing their money.  The payments themselves have plummeted though whether that counts as a difficulty I don’t know.  I’d be inclined to give GAW a pass on this one but just because I’ve not had the difficulty myself. 

Anyway, I just wanted to put all that down here before I conclude that GAW looks very much like a Ponzi scheme and I’m a goddamned idiot for buying into it and before I go log-in to Zen cloud and panic buy every hashlet I own.",cryptocurrency,1415191340

Filed a chapter 7 jointly with my SO today in California, discharging about 55K of debt including numerous credit cards, 2 auto loans.

Loss in income and unemployment in the last few months was the main driver of this decision with a bit of push from my SO, i was already living paycheck to paycheck and was barely keeping up with expenses; paying minimum balances and really not giving my family the life that they could have (with growing children;2) because i am paying debt that is all accruing huge interest rates. basically i was working to pay minimum payments and had nothing left. also no savings, no retirement, owed IRS 6k, interst rates in the 20%+.(so irresponsible and making good money 100K+/yr)(30 years old)

The main contributor that got me here was myself; mismanagement of funds-making alot of money at a young age and being stupid with it, not saving money, and spending my ass off - to get things and play with things that are now either sitting in my garage or collecting dust, its not here now to make me happy. Also financing and trading in cars with negative equity to further put me in the hole, as well as stupid high car payments totaling $1200. Monthly cashflow was like 6600, expenses were like 6500, just sad.

So yes, it was 1st, admitting how i was not being responsible and staying on top of my business and looking at the future - and making others suffer.

So, we filed - now what.

Main goals for me are - regain my SO's trust, no credit, save money, use cash, plan and budget and work my ass off, and communicate.

Additionally does anyone have any advice on which card to use to get the most point value from this type of transaction?  I currently have a chase sapphire preferred so will get 1 point per dollar assuming the transaction comes through as a purchase and not a money transfer.

tl;dr Want to use a credit card to pay off student loan debt to accumulate points instead of just directly paying off the loan.  Can it be done?  Which card is best.


Thanks for any guidance

EDIT:

Thanks for the replies.  Will call the loan companies and inquire about fees.  If/when we decide to do this I will update this for future reference.

Edit #2: Called the loan company and there were in fact no service charges or fees when using a credit card for payment.  The catch is that you cannot use a credit card to make a payment for more than the monthly payment, making it not an option if you are trying to pay off the balance of your loans for payments.  (you could use it on a month to month basis though)",finance,1415234438
personalfinance,I'm a college sophomore that will graduate with around 140k in debt. What should I do?,I'm getting 10k a year from the gov and that interest rate is around 7%.

personalfinance,I need advice paying down my loan/CC debt as a chef making little money.,"Hey all, here's my situation:

I'm on track to make around 24K this year (before taxes).  I'm earning $14 an hour, but only working about 30 hours a week.  I've tried asking for more hours, but it's the slow season and that's unlikely.  I've been in the industry for almost 4 years and have enough experience to make Sous Chef somewhere, and hopefully a hefty raise to go with it, but the job market is extremely competitive and I haven't found anything so far.  I'm searching and applying to anything that seems good every single day.  I have a potential lead that will pay around 40K, but that isn't a reality yet.

I'm about 20K in debt with student loans, plus a credit card that I just dropped a $1440 bomb on to bring that balance down to about $1860.  A bit over 7K of my 20 in student loans is from Sallie Mae, with a fabulous 12% interest rate (same as my CC).  The rest is DoE and ranges from 3-5% interest.

Expenses:  Student loans - $550(340 is Sallie Mae).  Phone - $90  Car insurance - ~$50. Gas is probably around $100-120.  Credit card is whatever is left over. I don't have rent or utilities because I moved back in with my parents to get my finances in order.  Did I mention that I'm 32?  Or that my girlfriend dumped me Saturday because I'm so focused on getting out of debt that I never have money to do anything, causing her to constantly stress about my finances?  Feeling really, really low lately and struggling to stay optimistic.

I'm starting a hummus business because I make really, really good hummus and I really, really am sick &amp; tired of being constantly broke.  The initial costs are minimal and I'm hoping it can bring in some additional cash with an eye towards making it a way to support myself in the future.

I'm mainly just looking for any suggestions or thoughts on what I could do differently.  I'm beyond frustrated with feeling like I'm just constantly dumping all my money into a bottomless pit, waiting for my life to begin and losing people I care about while I do so.  Thoughts?",finance,1415243487

personalfinance,Taking out a loan or applying for a credit card for medical needs,"I'm considering taking out a loan or getting a credit card to deal with some major dental work. I have not been to the dentist in about 7 years and my teeth are in bad shape but still fixable. Everything from prior shoddy dental work in the past to just the amount of time that has gone  by since I've been to a dentist has left me in a shit position. I'm in need of a few root canals/crowns and or extractions/bridges as well as general cavities that need to be taken care of.

 I doubt I have the best credit but in the same merit I'm also only 24 years old. Any bad credit I have is due to an old medical bill or two as well as a contested debt via college tuition. I bank with with Navy Federal and USAA if that in any way is relevant. I'm currently working two jobs. One of which is minimum wage gas station job and the other is for the state. Since my current state job isn't full time I don't get benefits. I'm about to move to another full time job with the state (that would include modest benefits) as well as keep the other part time state job while dropping the minimum wage job. 

 My question is...should I get a loan? Should I apply for a credit card? Is this a decent means to both get the dental work taken care of as well as build up credit? As I'm typing this I have a tooth in extreme pain.

I'm making enough money for payments, but not enough to pay outright for the expense. I do not have a lot of knowledge of credit cards or loans and I'd like to keep myself from getting into a sea of debt. I'm aware of the options to finance through a dental office. But CareCredit and Citi Health Cards seem like a rip off in terms of APR and monthly terms. Their contract makes me feel uneasy and if possible I'd like to avoid the ""Medical credit card"" options. I'd appreciate any advice. Or if you'd need more information please ask. I'm feeling a bit at the end of my ropes. Thanks.",finance,1415255788

I will make ~$85000 this year pre-tax with plenty of opportunities to grow fairly fast in the coming years. The only debt I have is $16643 (4.3%) in student loans that I will need to make payments on (~$171/mo) or pay off. I have ~$12000 cash on hand, own my car outright, and have house mates to share the rent burden. I also have a 750+ credit score. What I need to know is how I can reduce my potential ~$17000 pre-deductions tax burden. I also need to know how I can afford to buy a house ASAP. Interest rates are just going to go up and where I live housing prices have been going up 10% annually since the housing market bottomed out. Worse than that rents are going up just as fast! Currently the prices of the houses in the area I want to live/buy (the place where prices are going up fastest) are in the $320k-$380k range. Where I live property taxes are around 1%.

As far as retirement, my company does 401k matching after 1 year and I am still young enough that I think I can put it off until I am 25 especially with the investment opportunities of housing right now combined with the costs of renting. As far as risk goes, if things go badly I have enough credit card limits and such a great work ethic that I think I'll be able to figure out how to manage anything that might arise. I am also young enough that I am willing to take the risks at this time. Can reddit help me out?

Bitcoin,PSA on using changetip or any tipping service,"With the growing amount of tipping, I just wanted to remind everyone to keep no more than small amounts of bitcoins on these bots.  You don't control the private key, and the btc can disappear at any time with whatever is deposited. 

For example, changetip has it expressly written in their TOS that they can change the TOS at any time, and you cannot withdraw you coins (or use any of their services) unless you accept the new terms [1].  If you try tipping to someone else, the recipient must also agree to the TOS to accept the tip. If you want to sue to get your money back, you can't, the terms force you to use an arbitrator in California as well as waive your rights to a trial or class action lawsuit [2]. I despise forced arbitration.

Personally, I really don't like the idea of forcing a recipient to accept changetip's TOS to get a tip.  It's centralized bitcoin tipping, and that sounds like an oxymoron to me.  Even banks don't do that; if I write a check for $5, the recipient doesn't need to open an account at my bank to cash it.

Changetip will probably eventually sell to another business. They are primed to do so [3][4]. When that happens, users will be forced to accept whatever new TOS the new owners mandate, or the users will need to abandon their bitcoins with the option travel to California, pay an arbitrator, and hope to win the coins back. 

This isn't just changetip, please, weigh the risks before trusting any company with any amount that you mind losing.  **If you don't control the keys, then you don't control the coins.** 

Anyway, just be careful out there. There are a lot of wolves in sheep's clothing.

I'm a 25 year old undergraduate student. I have been working at a same job for 8 years now, and this past summer I started working for the University to make ends meet. I am a full time student, so usually it is part-time work to cover rent and I try to pay the interest on my unsub loans. I am inept when it comes to income tax and W-4/W-2, as my HR dept usually held my hand through it. 

My concern is that I am not having any tax taken from my paychecks from the school. I receive the gross amount of money for the hours worked. I have taxes taken out (state, federal, SS, etc) from my longtime employer, which I am used to. 

So finally my question: if I surpass the income for my tax bracket (single, unmarried), will I have to pay tax on the total amount I made for the year? Or just the amount that exceeds the tax bracket limit?

We're both living in the San Francisco bay area. We're both well paid in secure jobs, and we both still have decent credit ratings (above 700). However, I'm worried that won't last long if we don't do something about our debts. Here's how her balances look:

I have about $16K more per year that I can pay into my $175K student debt.

$20K at 4.22% interest on a private loan (not fixed)
$67K at 6.55% interest on government loans
$87K at 7.65% interest on government loans


Which option makes more sense for the next 6 years (when my husband gets a real paycheck in 6 years, we're dumping all of his take home pay into our student loan payments):

Option one: Continue paying on the graduated 25 year plan at $1087.09/mo, to be increased by about $200/mo every two years starting in 2015. 

Dump what remains of the $16K into the loans with the highest interest rate in December and June every year (The 16K figure has to account for subtracting the $200/mo increase in 2015 and 2017).

This option works out in the event we have a life event that would eat through our savings quickly (we have about 9 months of savings). 

Option two: Switch to the 10 year plan at $2059.80. With the extra $4327.48 (the amount left over from the 16k after accounting for the 972.71 extra per month paid on the 10 year plan versus the graduated plan) pay down the loans with the highest interest rate quicker. My loans would theoretically be paid off by 2024. (Assuming the following doesn't occur-)

After these 6 years, we're using virtually all of my husbands take home pay to pay down our loans as soon as possible. 33% will go towards my loans until they're paid off. The remaining 66% will go towards his (he'll have about $400K in student loans).

 So yesterday I made my decision and finally pulled the trigger on buying a car I've needed for months. After tons of research, I decided on a 2011 Mazda3 grand touring sedan with 40k miles for just under 15k at Carmax.

 I'm 27 years old, but i had no credit history at all. All my bills were under my parents/brothers name, or i pay ""under the table"". Before going to Carmax I tried to apply to my bank for a loan, but was denied due to no credit history. I know i should have gone to a credit union next, but i am not a member of one, and i figured Carmax would give me a decent APR rate.

 As it turns out, they could only offer me a 12.25% APR rate. This was a great car, and it had all the features i wanted, I just feel bummed about the high interest rate. They said i had 3 days to see if I can qualify for a better rate somewhere else, but with no credit history, how much better should I expect to get? is this an acceptable rate for a first time buyer with no credit history?

 The Carmax dealer told me i could always refinance after a year (not missing any payments) and I'd get a much lower rate. is this true? should i wait it out, or try and find a better rate ASAP (i have three days from purchase to find one). I would greatly appreciate any advice/tips/suggestions.

personalfinance,Wife owes me $30K; likely to be closer to $100K in a few years. I'm going to talk to a lawyer. What should I ask? (CA),"**I'M GOING TO TALK TO A LAWYER**

Canadian here. I have bee living with my SO for six years and got married a year ago. She has been in school the entire time and I have been working. I make about $150K and she makes nothing. She currently owes me about $30,000 for spending money and incidentals/rent on a place that I own. Since we got married, she no longer qualifies for student loans, so I have been paying her tuition. That's included in the $30K she owes. She starts her master's next year and I will be paying for that as well. She has been in an intensive program and there is little time for work. A part time job would cover a few hundred dollars here and there, but I would prefer if she focused on school instead since she is making top marks and getting decent scholarships. Still, they don't cover the full cost of tuition.

Her student loans, which she can no longer draw from, total about $75,000. Payments aren't due until she is done her master's so that gives us two years of breathing room -- yeah, right, as if I'm going to rest with that debt. I've been making regular payments on her student loans and any extra cash I get go into paying those down. The interest rate will be 8%!! We are both very careful with my money and she hates the fact that she needs to rely on me. I consider it all a wise investment since when she is done she will be looking at a six-figure salary to start in a stable, high demand, local career.

Now... **I'm going to see a lawyer** since after these next two years the money she owes me could very easily be close to $100,000. I am not charging her interest and have no intention of doing so. I want to see a lawyer because:

1. If the unexpected happens and we get a divorce, even though she promises that she will pay me everything back and will sign documents to that effect, does she have a legal obligation to do so?
2. If she dies, would I be able to take the money that she owes me from her inheritance or her parents' estate? (Her family hasn't and won't contribute anything to her schooling -- they think education is a waste of time. Yeah.)
3. If she dies, would I be able to write off the money that she owes me on my taxes?

I am posting this here to see if there is anything else the community can think of for me to ask the lawyer or there are any other issues I haven't thought about. Thanks!

**NB:**

* In anticipation of comments about how I'm not helping her by supporting her and it's her debt, she should take care of it -- I agree. The fact is though, that 8% on that loan is huge and is enough to impact my life as well. I want the debt gone as fast as possible so more of her money can go into savings for a down payment on a larger home. I'm just saving her the exorbitant interest.

It was only after marriage that she decided to do her master's (which I fully, 100% agree with), but it's those extra two years that are going to push her debt to me to uncomfortable levels.

personalfinance,Need advice for rebuilding credit--wait it out or is there something I can do now? Details in summary.,"College student, 22, will be done in Spring 2015. I have a solid income for now, just made a lot of mistakes, and am now learning from these lessons. I want to rebuild my credit, but don't have any credit cards right now to prove this. Let's just run through the details first:

- Bad credit score

- 9 active accounts, 4 closed (these should be gone within the next 1.5 yrs) the 9 active accounts are Fed Student Loans, and a Sallie Mae loan, will be around $55k total by the time I graduate

- 12 hard credit inquires (this is my big concern!) (4 will be gone in the next Q1 and Q2 of 2015, the rest in 2016) (I know, big mistake)

- CareCredit loan (paying a little above minimum every month, automatically deducted) (doable) (decided to keep a steady payment schedule to show consistency)

- Sallie Mae loan (same as above, steady payment schedule for consistency)

- Take home about $1500 a month, $650-$700 in rent/utilities/household supplies, ~$300 in food (home cooking and going out), the rest is left over income. Usually will put to entertainment, extra bill pay, and sometimes stupid stuff.

- I have enough for savings each month, I do keep a little here and there. My job takes out $150-$200 in ""short term investment loan"" aka retirement each month, so I have savings for when I leave the job. This varies on how many hours I work. I also Taskrabbit on the side when I have time. This usually is to pay for fun.

- Will be going through the Fed Loan repayment info soon, not worried about being able to pay these back.

(Let me know if any other info is necessary)

Things I know I am doing wrong:
- not keeping hard numbers on things
- not tracking how much I spend on food/entertainment
- not budgeting myself

Questions:

- Should I wait until more credit inquires clear to apply for a secured credit card? I want to rebuild my credit so that I can apply for apts with my better half in the next 2-4 years. They have excellent credit. I know that not having any credit lines is bad for my report. What do I do?

- **The two accts I have now, CareCredit and Sallie Mae, should I still keep the steady pay schedule or try to pay these off sooner?** They are in good standing on my credit report now.

- Recommendations? Which kind of card should I get? Can I apply for a secured card with a co-signer or something? I would want one soon because of holiday flights, which I can mostly afford, but will apply for one in mid-Spring 2015. Any other tips? 

I've lurked through a lot of similar conversations, decided to put out my own. I am slowly but surely keeping check on my finances!

personalfinance,"Going to have extra money, what to pay toward first? (US)","I am in the process of changing jobs and I am going to receive an ""extra"" paycheck of my accrued vacation time. I should have an ""extra"" 1300$ coming to me. I'm wondering what I should pay off or pay toward with this extra money to make the best possible choice.  

I am considering putting the full 1300$ toward my debts, split between my credit card and my student loans. Here are the loans that I am considering:  
* 1096.08$ with an interest rate of 6.55%  
* 383.46$ with an interest rate of 6.55%  
* 801.82$ with an interest rate of 6.55%

* 1013.75$ with an interest rate of 6.55%  
* 940.63$ with an interest rate of 5.35%    

My credit card balance is currently 2140.46$, which is a bit high for my liking, but the interest rate will be 0% until June of 2015, so I have a bit of time to pay it off.  

I was thinking about paying off the 383.46$ and 801.82$ in their entirety and then putting ~114$ toward the credit card for good measure.  

Ideas? Hints? Brilliant reasoning? Help me out, PF!

personalfinance,I desperately need to save my credit score... or do I?,"I am a freelance writer and editor (in two ways: I have a steady job, just without benefits/I also write and edit for additional publications for extra money) in New York City. I've got some pretty big overtime/freelance paychecks coming in, and I'm wondering how to best use them.

Money I currently have: 

Checking: $1,300

Savings: $1,000

Tax fund (I am sure I will owe, though unsure how much -- last year I got $1000 back, though I had a lot less 
freelance work. I am hoping I will break even this year, but am setting money aside just in case): $500

High interest savings: $3,000

I took some of the money I'd already received and just paid off my rent for the rest of the year.

I can expect to receive about $3500 in additional, freelance (so pre-tax) wages before the end of the year. I try to save about 30% of each freelance check, for taxes.

Here are my two main debts (other loans: one very small loan paid off earlier this year, one large bank loan being paid by my parents, one $17,000 loan that will take me a few more years to pay off):
Private bank loan: $4,364.00, at 6.494% mixed interest rate
Gov loan: $4,669.69, at 3.4% interest rate

IMPORTANT: I have bad credit. That loan being paid by my parents?  It is always late. I got a call from the lender today, and the payments are 70 days past due, due to an error on my father's behalf. I downloaded my credit report soon after; all my other loans are ""green"" and paid on time, but this Parent Loan is totally spotty. I cannot afford to pay it on my own, so this is my best option for now. Furthermore: after I graduated, there was a mix up and I thought my loans were in deferment for several months. They were not. I am back to paying on time (and have been for a year), but my credit is below 600. I cannot get a credit card. I was also able to pay off a very small ($800) loan earlier this year.

Here is my plan of action: first, I outlined a plan with my parents that they will transfer the money into my bank account monthly and I will manually pay the loan, to avoid any more errors. Second is to take a couple hundred bucks and apply for a secured credit card.

Where I am lost, though, is security vs. score: again, I'm a freelancer, so I like to have a nice cushion in case of the worst (and having financially unsavvy parents makes you obsess over these things), but if I skimp and scourge until the end of the year, I can have enough to pay off one of the smaller loan and have a little bit left over (I'd only pay if I had at least $1000 left over). 

Is that enough to make a noticeable dent in my credit score? I'm planning on moving out of my apartment in a few months, which means two things are on my mind: a credit check and having enough to pay first/last/security.",finance,1415318352

Basically, I have a set amount of money every month allotted to pay off these loans, that amount ranges from 1,200 to 1,500 dollars. Using this money I will pay all of the minimum payments and then any extra put towards to whatever loans make the most sense paying. I will also put any bonuses from work towards my loans so any advice on where I should put this would also be appreciated.  
 

My questions are:  
In what order should I prioritize paying these off?  
Is there any tips on expediting the payoff process, consolidating?  
With your recommendation, how long will it take me if I can pay the 1500 consistantly every month?  


I do budget every month and do want to be very aggressive on paying these off. My goal is to do it in 5 years. I know this will take sacrifices but right now I just need some guidance from you guys to get started.

1)Does frozen mean that the issuers no longer required to make interest payments? 

2)Wikipedia mentioned that if there are not enough bidders, the issuer must pay the maximum rate specified in the offering plans. Why would it be difficult to figure out a value for the ARS if it is paying a specific rate?

3) Were the issuers of the ARS mainly corporations or municipals, or investment banks? Just trying to get an idea of who wasn't able to pay off their debts or who got screwed into paying very high interest rates.

4) A lot of the ARS's were repurchased by the issuers at par. For the ones that did not / could not repurchase, does it mean that they were in default?",finance,1415334417

personalfinance,Tackling a life challenge,"Hey PF, hoping for some help in my life.

23yo grad-to-be here living in Kansas, and my day has been turned upside down. 

I happened to be at my parents house today while they were at work, and had a knock on the door. A county clerk delivered a summons for court. I read through it and saw my parents owed around $6000 on their mortgage and were being sued for non-payment the past 120 days. As I read further, I noticed the State had a claim to the property as well, due to the fact that my mother had unpaid state taxes of $4000 from their jointly-filed 2011 taxes.

When my parents get home, I present them with this and everything unravels. My dad has $30k in credit card debt that hasn't had payment in a year, owes $40k in federal taxes from 2011 and earlier. The reason it isn't higher is because he hasn't filed the past two years. My mom was oblivious to all of this.

It was a really emotional experience where my Dad told of his gambling addiction, how with his winnings he had to claim $300k in income but really just put all that money back into the casinos. Their income from their paid jobs is around $90k. This continued in the past two years, and those taxes aren't even filed.

You can imagine how long it took me to process this. There is no way they don't divorce, and I'm looking for ANY guidance on how to beat this.

First, I want to take you through the steps I've taken in the past few hours.

- Ran a credit report on my mom and dad. Outside of the $30k in cc debt on the same card, their reports looked extremely good! They've taken around $510,000 in loans and credit throughout their life and have paid it all off.

- My best friend's brother is a bankruptcy lawyer and has his own firm, said he would come to their house to consult with them on Monday.

- Called the bank to tell them the situation, their lawyer said he would immediately stop the foreclosure process. He's mailing the paperwork Monday for an allowance period before starting the payments on the final $6k. They didn't want to go to court at all on this issue.

My dad was a self-employed salesman from 1990 to 2008. Retired in May of that year, and during the recession lost around $1.2m from his investments over the course of two years. He know works and makes $30k/year. My mother is a teacher and makes $60k. They have no retirement fund outside of her pension, but they are able to pay their other monthly bills.

- Do my brother and I need pay for a CPA to join the meeting monday?
- How do I go about contacting the correct people at the IRS? There is no way he'll be able to pay those back-taxes.
- I thought my family was extremely close and we could help each other through anything, but now I think I need to get counseling help for my dad. This is beyond us.

I'm hoping that some of you might be able to give me some advice and help put my mind at ease, even if only for a little while.  In December, I'll be graduating from West Virginia University with a B.A. in geography and political science.  Between Christmas and the new year, I will be flying out to Seattle to live with a friend from college who's already established herself out there.  Under the most likely scenario, we'll be staying in her current apartment in Fremont/Wallingford where rent will be $400/month per person.  At least at first, I will be leaving my car behind in Maryland.  Thus far, I do not have a job lined up there, although I've potentially lined up one interview (I'll find out late next week).  With my one-way flight already purchased, I've got a little under $2000 and counting in my savings account.  

Unfortunately, my naïveté allowed me to accrue what is now approximately $110,000 in student loans over the course of my college career.  About $30,000 of those are student loans insured by the federal government (as most are), which of course provides for an array of repayment options.  The rest are insured by PNC Bank.  Because these loans are insured by a bank, nothing like an income-based repayment plan exists and they are currently accruing interest at a very high rate.  I can do nothing about this until I enter my grace period, the six months between my graduation and when the first payment is due.  A customer service rep I spoke with recently estimated that my payment would be approximately $850/month and that no other payment options would be available to me until I've expended all of my deferment and forbearance time (during which interest would obviously continue to accrue).  Refinancing was suggested as an option, but I know nothing of what that might entail and no one would give me details as I'm still currently enrolled in school.  

As I said, I've still got seven months before I necessarily have to worry about paying on these loans, but I'll have moving expenses, rent, and utilities beginning in January.  I just want to have a solid plan in place sooner rather than later.  Aside from my abhorrent student loan situation (which, to be fair to me, was primarily laid out for me by my similarly naive ~75 year old grandparents when I was 17), I've always been good at saving, living within my means, and making responsible decisions with regard to money.  Although none of the bills at my current residence are in my name, I've collected the money each money and have yet to be late on a payment.  Similarly, I have never missed a credit card payment.  I just want to maintain my good credit and to be able to meet my obligations every month without living in absolute poverty.  I truly would appreciate any advice you might have.",finance,1415353564

Really want to get back on track.,"**The short:** I’m a 27y.o., survivor of sexual abuse, living with PTSD and depression, and facing almost 65K of debt. My personal story is not pleasant, but I persevered to survive. Along the way to recovery, however, I made some very bad financial choices and feel like it’s almost too late to rectify.  


I have my emotional health and life together now, and have found happiness in love and friendships. However, the financial hole I dug myself into is not getting all that better. I would like to do everything I can so that I do not become a burden on my incredibly loving partner. I would also like to be pre-emptive so that I do not face any further negative ramifications.   
  
I paid off the first two years of college during it with a simultaneous job. My family was unable to help me financially with my education. In University, I was able to maintain an average B level GPA, was on the student government, was president of an organization, and in an honors fraternity. After graduation, I found work at various office jobs - despite that my degree and heart is in the arts. I put aside ""*following my dream*"" because it didn't pay my rent. I've been doing what I can to make ends meet. I've spent the last four or five years working to try to pay down my loans and try to get a job that will allow me to do so. The past year has been hard financially, and I now only have a job as a host at a bar for $10/hour for about 30 hours a week, because it is better than no job. I am moving to weekend bar-backing there soon, at $10/hr plus tips, and to act as the fill-in bartender while I learn. I know I’ll be a great at it and start making more money soon, but I’m scared about my car getting repo-ed and my other bills piling up while I work my way up. What can I do?   
  
My credit score was 720, but has now completely tanked. I have no active credit cards, so there is no more spending on those. I do not go out, I do not shop, and every paycheck I make goes to my bills. My partner and I split rent and utilities, and he’s aware of my financial situation. 
  
**Monthly rent:** $350 + $50 Utilities  
**Misc monthly costs:** $100/phone (contract ends in May and I can go down to $45/month if I keep the same phone and no new contract.), groceries, and gas to get to work (approx. $50 every three weeks.)  
**My car:** $280/mo - I’ve paid off two out of five years total already, and it was the only thing helping my credit right now. However, I’m now two months behind because my checks haven’t been able to cover it. I have to have it to get to work, and I know I won't get a better interest rate than I did for many years since I tanked my credit. Total outstanding due is $11,188.77 at 2.5%   
  
**My insurance:** Was $125, but they cancelled my coverage when a check bounced. I need new low-cost insurance despite my bad credit.  
  
**School loans:** I have $60/month that I actually pay. And the rest is on hold until I prove my income level, and my application for income-based repayment goes through.  
  
*AES Loan 1: $5,363.31 at 2.85%  
*AES Loan 2: 2,274.66 at 2.08%  
*Sallie Mae loan 1: 6,460.96 at 8.25%  
*Sallie Mae/gov loan 1: $20,727.51 at 6.38% (I was able to consolidate a ton of small loans into one two years ago and bring that interest rate down.)  
*Sallie Mae/gov loan 2: $5,376.42 at 6.38%  
**Total school debt:** $40,202.86  
  
The majority of my credit card debt is food/rent that I stupidly charged while not making enough to live during college and early post-college when I didn't have anywhere else to go. I kept thinking I’d land a great job with my degree and hard work and things would get better. I’m a dumb-ass. I know that now.  
  
*Credit card 1: $3,210.51  
*Credit card 2: $677.53  
*Credit card 3: $6,112.00 (I’m on a 12 month repayment program with them for $180/month to bring my account to good standing. I’ve been able to make the first two months on time. It takes all the money that’s left after rent, utilities, and my phone bill in order for me to keep this arrangement.)  
*Credit card 4: $3,336.86 (21+%APR on the original card. I’d been paying $90/month for six years, took a long time to figure out why it wasn't going down. Bought it out with a loan from my credit union, with a lower interest rate, but have since defaulted on it, as I went through a catatonic state last year and lost track of my bills. Definitely the dumbest thing I've done and the first thing I’d like to get back on track.)  
  
**Total debt cards + school loans = $64,728.46**  
  
**Income:** $10/hour, 30 hours a week. Approx $300 per bi-weekly paycheck, after taxes.  
  
I know my personal circumstances are not excuses for my financial situation, and I’ve made some bad choices. However, battling both PTSD and poor financial choices is a very hard thing to do at the same time. I am having a very hard time sleeping while worrying so much about finances and the two do not mix well. Any help is greatly appreciated. It took a lot to post this.",finance,1415356879

personalfinance,Currently a second-year undergraduate student. What can I do to prepare for paying med school tuition?,"I'm a sophomore paying out-of-state tuition (~40,000 including living/food costs). Currently, my fist and second year has been paid for, with the exception of ~12,000 in federal loans. I don't know how else to pay for the remaining years except with loans, since I don't expect my parents to support me, partially because they are unable to, beyond occasional help in paying for groceries or so.

I'm currently pre-med. Assuming I follow through with this decision, what can I do to minimize my med school costs (and even my undergraduate cost if possible)? A few options include any combination of doing an MD, PhD which pays a stipend for my research (a really appealing option, because I can't decide between grad school and researching and medicine!), going to my state school, going to another public school like Ohio State where they allow you to pay in-state tuition after one year, taking out loans, and living frugally.

personalfinance,"Trying to decide what makes more sense, pay off my car loan, re finance,steady payments, all before I move to CA.","This is my first time posting here, but you guys are pillars of wisdom so I am hoping you can help shed some light on this for me as I am really trying to get a more solid handle on things. 

I currently owe about $5,700 on my car loan at a 12% interest rate. I can refinance it back to $6,700 @ 7% 

I pay $211 a month on this and have since purchasing over two years ago. 

In hindsight...I was a first time car buyer and had no cosigner so I was just an idiot with this purchase. 

To add to this, I am moving from MN to CA at the beginning of April to pursue film work in producing. 

As of today I have around 8k in savings and am projected to have 12-13k by the date I move. 

Moving expenses including first months rent and deposit will be around $3,500 and in general it is just more expensive out there. 

That being said, does it make more sense to take the hit in my savings, pay the loan off outright, refinance it or just keep on making my steady payments?

My hope is to double my car payment once I pay off the $800 or so in credit card debt I currently have. Which should be done by the end of this month. 

My concern/apprehension in doing it is taking such a large bite out of my savings before moving. I was unemployed last year for around 6 months and having that cushion saved me then and I hope to have it should things get rough in CA. 

Thank you all so much for your input. Please let me know if there is further info that might help you get a better sense of my financial picture.

personalfinance,Magical $3000 Cars,"A recurring piece of advice given in r/PF is to sell your new or newish car and buy a cheap used car to help pay off debt.

This is curious to me because it seems like it comes with a fair amount of risk.  I personally wouldn't want to choose something that ends up costing me money, time or frustration in the long run...thereby damaging the goal of paying off debt.

Basically, how are you not pouring money into unexpected repairs?  

Is it because:
a.) You have a relative/friend that ""knows"" how to help you choose a ""good"" used car?
b.) You have an existing good relationship with a mechanic?
c.) You are a mechanical engineer or mechanic yourself?
d.) Other?

Just curious why these cars are not risky in most people's opinion?

And for context, my debt is not eating me alive, but I have about 10K equity in my car right now and some low interest card debt.  I am considering selling and buying used but I am just scared of the risk from my perception.  For the record I definitely could understand maybe taking the risk if someone is drowning in debt (super high balance/interest rate, low income, etc.).

EDIT: I did not expect this discussion to be so popular as it is my first Reddit post ever. :-)  Good points below, I did not expect so many folks to share my thoughts on the risk!  Those folks valued the peace of mind...which I do as well.  Many of you who are proponents of the magical $3000 car mitigated that risk because of a-c above, earning to do the work on your own or knowing the seller of the vehicle.",finance,1415373665

personalfinance,How to prepare financially for a spouse with a chronic medical condition?,"Hi! I've been a lurker for quite some time on this sub and the amount of information that I've learned has been amazing. It has made me panic less about money and made my relationship even better (wasn't in trouble but could have been if we didn't listen to you guys!).

I recently had the realization that my husband, 31, will always have expensive medical bills because he *had* ulcerative colitis, now has a j-pouch, and requires periodic tests and constant meditation to keep the pouchitis under control. We currently have good insurance (BCBS PPO with a low deductible) but because he recently had a flex sig, it reminded me that this may not always be the case and will be something that may become worse in older age. 

How can I prepare for this possibility? I love the idea of HSAs, but the high deductible at this point would be more than we can afford if he were on the plan.

Right now, we make pretty much exactly 100k. 

1. We have about 70k in student loans between the two of us.

2. We have a 17k car loan for a whopping 1.2% interest rate.

3. Have about 2k in CC debt. And dropping. Should be out in only a few more months.

4. Have been working on reducing the debt a lot in the past year and this is why this sub has been awesome for us.

5. The insurance is deducted from my husband's paycheck on a monthly basis through his employer, so this is the only financial information I do not have immediate access to, though I am 100% positive on the basics of $150/month (I believe for each of us), PPO, deductible is $300 for each of us, meds are mostly covered, and through CVS, are even cheaper if they are not covered.

6. Our cost of living is about 4700/month, take home after insurance and retirement accounts and public transportation stuff is 5800/month. the rest is divided between loans and savings. I know we could reduce our cost of living *more* but please, I'm not looking for that. As it stands, that's a compromise with my husband and I put him before saving a few bucks more.

7. His medication though CVS is about $8/month, though this recently changed because it wasn't as effective anymore. IDK what the cost was for the new meds but they weren't terrible.

I mostly manage the money now (and I think you'd be proud how much I reduced our debt in the last year and that awesome low car loan interest). Our emergency fund is still rather small as we have had a few small emergencies in the last year. It's at $1600. Not nearly enough for a major emergency.

My question is, how can I save for his health? 

What accounts are out there that could be useful for him, other than a good old fashion savings account? 

Is it possible or beneficial for me to have my own insurance with an HSA that I can then use for his payments or can I only use the HSA for *my* medical bills? I don't need as many checkups as he does, so a high deductible for me wouldn't be as big of a problem as long as I can get free yearly checkups (gyno at the very least).

Is our insurance currently acceptable or is there something out there that will be better, like ACA (example)?

Also, I'm 27, with only endometriosis, which is a mostly benign disease, though I do need BC pills to help control it or my fertility could diminish from scarring. My doctor prescribed me beyaz, which is probably the only BC that does not make me moody as hell, but is $120 out of pocket but free through our insurance and CVS. And I don't think there is a generic version yet (because patents). I'm very healthy otherwise.

If there's anything else that I might have missed, please feel free to ask. Also, legal things I should consider (other than divorce)?

Thanks in advance! Also, please refrain from advice on how I can reduce the cost of living, or whatever. I know. I put this info up so that you have the best idea possible of our current situation. I'm asking for financial information on chronic medical conditions, not debt reduction.",finance,1415375748

personalfinance,Judge my retirement plan please.,"My wife and I are in our mid-20s.  So far we've been living frugally and dedicating about 70% of our income on paying off our student loans.  At this point all of our private loans are gone and we only have a handful of federal loans left that we expect to have paid off by the end of this year.

We are trying to put together a retirement plan that we can start to action on starting January of next year.  Everything is based on 2014 dollars.  I read all the guides and FAQ on the site to come up with this plan.  

My wife is in the military but she'll be out by the time she is 44.  She has employment on the side, employment before the military, and will work after the military.  At this rate I believe she will draw a pension and a small social security amount.

1.  Expected pension - ~$28,000/year.
2.  Expected total social security - ~$38,000/year

Our retirement account contributions...  I don't have a 401k yet but I hopefully will in the next year or so.

1.  $18,000/year into her Roth 401k
2.  $5,500/year into my Roth IRA
3.  $5,500/year into her Roth IRA

And our investment contributions...

1.  $15,300/year into Vanguard total bond market index
2.  $15,300/year into Vanguard total stock index
3.  $7,000/year into Vanguard total international stock index

These investment numbers should increase after she retires but I'm leaving them as is because I really don't know how to calculate that.  Assuming everything else remained the same that would mean an extra $28,000 (before taxes) annually to invest.

Our goal is $150,000 in 2014 dollars in retirement at a withdrawal rate of 4%.  I calculate that we would need $2.1 million in 2014 dollars to achieve this goal.

Do you think this plan will achieve that goal?  I saw a recommendation to use FireCalc and I used it but I'm not sure I did it correctly.  I put a portfolio of 0, spending of $150,000, and years = 100.  On the other income tab I entered 38,000 starting in 2055 and 28,000 starting in 2032.  On the 'not retired' tab I entered the retirement year of 2045 and an annual contribution of 67,200.  Spending model was CPI and constant spending power adjusted for inflation.

Also, are we over-planning?

personalfinance,"I have a tax question regarding income from sales commissions (In Colorado, USA)","This is my first post to this sub.  As far as I can tell, it's not in violation of any rules, but if there's a better place to take my question, please let me know.  

Background:

My wife started a job in sales about a year ago.  She makes like $15/hour, and then gets $8 per demo she sets up, and $100/sale that comes from any of her demos.  The company she works for hires on a temp basis to start, and does a full hire once an employee demonstrates 3 consecutive months of achieving the target sales numbers.  Last may, she was hired full time.  

The question:

When my wife was employed as a temp, her commissions were taxed at the highest rate, so 40% or so.  Once she was hired full time, they were taxing her far less.  I don't have a pay stub, but a recent commission total of $808 turned into $738 deposit in her checking account.  I told her to ask about it, and her payroll department said her commission total was below some threshold for federal withholding.  

Does this seem right?  I typically do our taxes with turbotax, but last year, she hadn't yet earned any commissions (she was only employed during the month of December, most of which was training in 2013, so she really hadn't had any sales yet) so I haven't seen how that works out.  738/808 is only 8.7% tax (or whatever withholding...I haven't seen her pay stub) so I'm just afraid that I'll be hit with a huge tax bill.  

As far as overall taxation, does income from sales commissions count the same as any other income, or is it considered a bonus?  Was the 40% they were withholding from her as a temp too high, and would it balance out some of her potentially undertaxed checks from more recent months?  Due to some recent policy/pricing/hiring changes at her company, her sales have been down considerably since she was hired full time, and so her biggest checks were taxed the highest (she went from $2000 gross commission checks/month to $500-$800).  

My goal with income taxes is to come out as close to even as possible in April.  If I owe, there's little benefit, as I'll be earning fractions of a percent in interest from my savings account, and if I get a return, I'm giving the government a free loan, so I'd rather not do that either. I've been trying to get my wife to get answers from her employer, but they've been slow in getting back to her and I just finally learned what I've described about it being below a threshold yesterday.  We make around $120k/year combined, if that's of any relevance.  

What do you kind folks think?  Does anyone that's worked for commissions know how the tax rates on that kind of thing work? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1415380300
personalfinance,Curious to see where I can improve my finances!,"Hi /r/personalfinance! I've lurked here for awhile but never posted anything. Reading through a lot of threads has made me curious where I can make improvements here and there on my spending and get a better/realistic savings goal going on. I don't know of any specific advice I need, but any constructive feedback is welcomed :) 

So here's a little bit about me:

* 25 years old
* 740 credit score 
* $15,550 total debt ($15k of which is my car, which I have a 0.9% interest rate on and 4 more years left on the payments, $400 is on my credit card for a hotel which I literally *just* charged--normally the card stays dormant at 0 balance, $50 is on my secured credit card and that is from a recurring gym membership, and $100 is on my paypal credit account for misc spending like gifts for family and clothes I needed). Other than the car payment, I generally keep my balances close to 0. I have a couple of store credit cards, all sitting at 0 balance.
* Savings account currently sitting at about $2100 for emergencies. I'd like to start adding to this more regularly but I'm not sure how much per month would be realistic.
* Rent is $800/month. 
* Car payment is $300/month.
* Utilities are about $300/month on average.
* I make about $2000-$2500 monthly, paid once a month and I am an IC so I get a 1099 at the end of the year. My roommate gives me $300 a month for his room, and my fiance who lives with me generally takes care of our food, gas, and misc monthly expenses.

personalfinance,GA: Should my husband walk away from the house or do we have other options? (xpost r/legaladvice),"I have never owned a home myself, so I don't know the technicalities or jargon related to owning a home, but I will do my best to explain the situation as far as I know.

Some background: my husband got a divorce after a 22-year marriage in 2008. The home mortgage was in both his and his ex-wife's name, and the home has not been refinanced since, so it is still in both of their names, although the ex-wife does not live in the home. His ex-wife filed bankruptcy soon after the divorce; my husband did not. His mortgage is split up into two: one mortgage is worth $140,000, and the second mortgage is worth $37,000.

He was paying about $650 for the first mortgage, and about $100 for the second per month. (Why they were so low I'll get to later.) The second mortgage was being automatically deducted from his bank account per month. However, he checked his bank account yesterday only to find that Suntrust (the bank with his second mortgage) had taken out over $850 for the $100 payment. He had $1200 in his checking account, so there was no overdraft, but he was still miffed.

Assuming it was a mistake, he went to the bank to try and get the $750 back that was charged to him on top of his $100 monthly minimum. However, they informed him that the second mortgage (which his ex-wife had opened up) was only a 10-year loan, and it had expired that month. My husband asked if it could be renewed, but they responded they could not renew a contract that was in collections. Confused, my husband asked why it was in collections since he was paying on time every single month. They said that since his ex-wife was on the second mortgage and she had filed bankruptcy, their system also had him flagged as bankrupt, and so the account automatically went into collections, resulting in the $850 payments. (We still don't know how they came up with that number per month.)

My husband told Suntrust he could prove he was, in fact, not bankrupt so that way they could fix error in the system so he could renew and go back to $100 payments. The lady gave him a number to call (bankruptcy department), but she was absolutely no help. The lady on the phone basically said there was nothing they could do to fix the error, and the account would remain in collections and that $850 per month was the absolute lowest they could go on the payments.

Now, we really can't afford $850 + $650 per month. We just can't. And I am in between jobs now, so I can't apply for a mortgage myself. We only see that we have two options:

* Try and get a loan to pay off the $37,000 and home that the payments are still in the do-able range for us. (Probably no more than $300 per month.) I really don't think we're going to find a loan that will do that for us, but this is our first option.

* When/if that doesn't happen, rent a house somewhere, declare bankruptcy, and walk away from the house altogether.

Those are the only two options I see given that Suntrust is going to remain incompetent on this matter. On top of all this, I looked at my husbands statements going back the last ten years, and because his payments were so low on the $37,000 loan, he was only paying interest for at least ten years, and has only paid a few thousand towards the principle on his $140,000 loan. So he has basically been renting his home for the last ten years and almost exclusively paying toward the interest. I don't know if that's entirely relevant, but I feel like it makes it a hell of a lot easier to walk away from the house.

Do we have any other options? We're hoping Suntrust gets their shit together, but we can't find anyone willing to help us out there...

personalfinance,"~$800 student loan payments, half in my name, half are Parent Plus loans I am helping Mom with. Advice please.","So long time lurker... First time, well you know..
Anyways, Here is the background.  
I was a bit lost after high school(06 grad) and was fully expected go to straight to college but was not prepared(totally my fault). I saw ITTs ad and next time i know i was enrolled for an EE degree. I do have a passion for electronics, and i rationalized that electronics are going to be in everything in the future so good job stability. At the time i did not fully grasp the amount of debt this would lead to. and there was indication of financial support with it from the parents after graduation. And there was at first. 

After working my butt off to show i was as capable engineer as the others around me(i had to start out as an electronic technician), i am currently an EE making decent money. I am paying my loans i took out, roughly 300 a month directly out of school. and my mom was paying her end. I offered to help pay for the $450 monthly payments for her because she does not have a large income at all.  I can afford to pay this and rent and all of that but the sacrifice is not having much play money.

i am posting this so i can get a better grasp of how to move forward.
Total debt : $23,000 in my personal loans, $29,000 in parent plus loans in my mothers name but taken out for me so i am paying them,
Current payments: $300 for my loans, $450 for the Parent Plus.

I believe that those are somewhat a bit higher than the minimum, and i am not sure what the current interest rates are. 

Please Reddit, give me some options and advice.  
1) can i consolidate these loans somehow? is it worth it?  
2)Are there low income assistance programs for this circumstance(I cut her a check, she then cuts a check for the loan, since the loan is in her name and she has low income, is there anything we can do there)?  
3)??? I dont even know.. Obviously budget, and i do, but every time i get a little savings up, the car breaks or something in the house breaks and needs to be replaced. 

There are a few large expenses i see coming up, mainly needing to replace the car( i can fix most things, but its nickel and diming me to death). see #3 above.

Thanks Reddit!

*$231 'Everything Else' (Restaurants, alcohol, entertainment, sports, medical, car repairs/maintenance, mini-emergencies, etc.)

[Company matches 100% on 1st 3% ($25 contribution + $25 match), 50% on next 2% ($17 contribution + $8.50 match)]


MISC: 
BONUSES: Quarterly, based on sales, range from $250-$800 take home pay per quarter. (I purposely don't factor these into my income)


NOTE: I base all my budgets on the idea of getting two bi-weekly paychecks / month. This gives me ~2 'freebie' paychecks per year depending on the yearly pay schedule calendar-- I like to consider this bonus money and not rely on it for budgeting.


Current situation:
I just paid off my car ($2400, 95 Toyota Avalon, ~88k mi, excellent condition) as of today and thus am reorganizing my monthly budgets to utilize that money differently. Looking at a snapshot of my debts and expenses, I just feel like it's time to get some input on what to tackle first.
I've taken an honest look at my expenses over the last 6 months, and feel I have it whittled down to a point where I can comfortably eat healthy, enjoy a few splurges a month on fun, but also keep my belt tight. I'm satisfied with my current expenditures.


*The main thing I want input on is whether or not it makes sense to put essentially any and all extra income into my emergency savings.
*My goal is to aggressively save ($350 currently allotted per onth plus  any credit card rewards, work bonuses, 'freebie' income checks, tax refunds, etc.) until I hit the $4000 mark, as that puts me at 3+ months worth of expenses safely tucked away.
*I would eventually like to live and work abroad again, perhaps permanently (in the next 5 years or so), and feel that paying off my debt (especially my federal student loans) is crucial to that goal
*The idea of moving abroad makes me nervous to contribute too much to a 401k retirement account that may be useless later. (Is this a rational fear?)
*The $10000 loan from my parents is repayable whenever, and in any increments, as long as I pay it to them in full eventually. However, they are adamant that I should get on my own more solid financial footing before I make a concerted effort to pay that back aggressively.
*I am not planning any major purchases in the forseeable future.
*After the holidays, I will be looking to upgrade my job situation and will start aggressively applying to jobs that will earn me more money. This will likely mean relocating.


Some things I am prepping for:
*In spite of being unsure about long term retirement plans/location, I'll want to max out 401k contributions the moment I am able to do so, 2/24/15, and will plan for $50/mo contributions starting that date.
*My IBR on my student loan will be re-calculated Feb 2015, and will likely go up (though since my gross income is 27k it will still likely be quite low).


So my questions are:
-Am I correct in thinking my best move is to aggressively sock away any extra funds into my emergency account until it hits that $4000 mark? Or am I slacking on something else in the meantime that isn't obvious to me?
*Would this be a reasonable way to use that $350 a month after I've hit that $4000 mark:
--Downsize monthly emergency savings fund contributions from $350 to $50
--Increase federal student loan payments from $0 to $300
--Any 'extra' money (i.e. any credit card rewards, work bonuses, 'freebie' income checks, tax refunds, etc.) go to a new, non-emergency savings account (essentially just to keep me from putting it immediately in my checking account and doing something impulsive with it). I'm still fleshing out what the actual purpose of this 2nd savings account would be, but I'm thinking it would be a good holding ground for things like relocation funds or deciding to make a large payment on one of my debts. 


I am very open to input on what to do with my money that is not already going to expenses! This is unchartered territory for me, as it's the first time I feel in control somewhat of my financial situation, but I want to make sure I'm maximizing every penny! Thanks all.

I need to move out of my apartment because it has mold in it on the walls in the drains etc,.. I think it is toxic mold because my cats and I are experiencing symptoms associated with toxic mold illness as far as what I can see online. I have a mold inspector coming in Saturday and I have to pay him $390. I'm currently withholding rent and they take legal action on the 15th. I'm going to have the mold results and be out of the apartment by then. I'm going to have a lawyer handle breaking the lease for me as it is legal to do so for mold under Civil Code 1941. 

I don't have enough money to relocate to a new apartment or even to stay in a hotel room so I've been trying to apply for loans. My credit was barely established in August and I have two stupid parking tickets on my credit showing up as collections but otherwise absolutely no missed payments anywhere. The score on CKarma shows as 598, my bank says my FICO score is 633. 

I've applied for personal loans through my bank, for payday and installment and signature loans online, even with shitty interest rates, and I haven't been approved by ANYONE so far. My current employment has only been since the start of September so I think that affects it as well. I've tried going through broker websites like LendingTree etc,. Basically if you can google 'bad credit loans' I've already applied and fucking failed. 

I don't know what to do. I just need $3500 and I've even offered a cosigner $1500 of a $5k loan that I'll pay off entirely -- essentially a free $1.5k. But nobody will help me. And I don't have ANYONE close to me family/friends wise who can cosign. 


I don't have a lot of faith that I'll find a loan or a route I've already tried going down here, but I'm posting out of desperation. Please, PLEASE someone help me figure this out. I'm only 23.

personalfinance,"Full time job, full time NYC college student. I pay for everything, parents reap the ""benefits"" of claiming me as a dependent, and I have no guidance on how to function (financially) as an adult.","This is a two-part question. I'm going to give a quick rundown of my college financial info and then later my general financial info.

* I attend Columbia University which has a massive tuition BUT they meet 100% of financial need (according to FAFSA). It was cheaper for me to go to Columbia than a state school.
* My parents paid for my first year at college. I'm currently in my second year and I've been working nonstop and I've been paying my own tuition for the current second year.
* I also pay my own living expenses (food, clothes, etc.). I do not live at home. I haven't lived at home since I moved out to come to college. I currently live on campus and in the summers I get an apartment.

To break down what's included in my money to Columbia and my financial aid:

* FAFSA determined we could pay $18,000 per year.
* Columbia's tuition + room + board + health insurance is about $63,000 so Columbia gave me $40,000 in financial aid (gift money!) with about $5k in federal loans.
* How did I pay the $18k? I donated my eggs twice this summer ($8k each time) and then I worked at a SAT test prep school making $40/hour in cash full time. CURRENTLY I put in about 16 hours at the test prep school each weekend. I also work 20 hours/week at a ""real"" $10/hour job. As an FYI, I will not be reporting egg donation money and my SAT test prep school job will not be filing a 1099 and all my income is in cash/off the record. A lot of the money over the summer went to rent so I wasn't able to enter into the school year with much in savings. I also took a trip to Europe with my best friend which may have been a little silly financially but I don't regret it at all. The school is cutting down its classes so I'll be going from 16 hours/week to 6 hours/week. A lot of my money now is going to helping my little brothers and other random stuff (bought one a laptop he needed for an internship, gas money when they're short, the family cat needed a $500 surgery done last week, I had to pay $500 last month for dental work, etc)

I'd like to file independently on the FAFSA for the 2015-2015 school year so that I can receive more gift money because it's becoming very difficult to keep up with tuition and buy food and new shoes and textbooks, etc. I fear that my expected family contribution will increase in the 2015-2016 school year and I'll struggle to keep up with those payments when I'm barely scraping by already.

**Question 1: Does anyone have any advice on how to switch my FAFSA dependency?** I know it's very difficult to do, but there was a history of physical abuse and drug abuse in the past. We're on relatively good terms now, but I pay everything so that I don't ""owe"" them anything (yes, I frequent /r/raisedbynarcissists!).

Some additional financial info:

* I have $1,000 in savings. Not much, I know, but I'm maxed out on time and I have no way of picking up a third job in addition to school.
* I FINALLY have my first credit card (no cosigner - my parents' credit is very bad). I'm working on building my credit. I've only had it for 4-5 months though. I pay it off in full every month so there aren't any issues there.
* I have student loans (no private loans). I'm not concerned about them yet because, well, I don't really have any room to start working on them and they're not technically due for another 3 years.
* My parents only currently pay for my cell phone bill. 

**Question 2: ANY general financial advice for me? I don't really have any financial guidance in my life and any direction would be appreciated!**

Fortunately, I seem to be okay at this lawyering thing, although I really don't know what to do with what I have, and now that I have a 1 year old, and I'd really like to start seriously planning about the future.

1) Living with parents with wife (was broke after law school, and even after I paid off loans three years ago, just sort of hung around).

2) Have 1 year old child (which means parents actually want me around)

3) Wife and I have 1 car between us that we just purchased last year, an SUV that cost $26,000.  We carpool to work.

4) After taxes we made $120,000 in the last 12 months and spent $40,000

5) We've saved about $180,000 in cash and put about $100,000 in retirement in the last three years.  Retirement is all in a Vanguard Target Retirement 2040/2045 funds.

6) Wife is a shop-a-holic.  I don't think I can do anything about this, but she doesn't spend as much as she earns.

7) I have a $500,000 life insurance plan, wife has $250,000 life insurance plan.  I =think this is a term life insurance plan.  I'm not even sure what it is, but I heard on the radio that maybe I should have one.

8) Wife works for federal government and is getting some sort of pension on retirement.  Don't know the details of this.

9) Spend $1000 a month on daycare.

10) We eat out every day.

personalfinance,US Printing $85 Billion Per Month,"Did you know the Federal Reserve is printing $85 billion per month of new money through a program called Quantitative Easing? This is the 3rd round and like all the last programs it has to come to an end. Did you know this could be one of the greatest investment opportunities since the financial crash of 2008? 

Let me explain… 

The last time they ended Quantitative Easing 2 was June.31, 2011 and at the time gold was sitting at $1500 per ounce while silver was sitting at $34 per ounce. In less than 2 month of ending Quantitative Easing 2 by August.22, 2011 gold skyrocketed to over $1900 per ounce while silver moved to over $46. If you do the math that is a 35% increase in silver and a 27% increase in gold in LESS than 2 months! The reason this happened is because gold and silver are the ultimate hedge against the devaluation of the dollar and as they print more money… gold and silver become extremely valuable.

The time to buy gold and silver is now. If you are like me and you do not have immediate cash available to purchase gold and silver… then do what I did. I discovered a way to take an existing retirement account and move it into physical gold and silver you can hold, completely tax free WITHOUT your financial planner. 

I am happy to tell you that after hours and hours of research I have found the most reputable company who specializes in this kind of transaction and I urge you to get in contact with them. This company was recently featured in the Forbes 2013 Investment Guide and made the 2013 Inc. 500 list as one of the fastest growing companies in the US.

personalfinance,"Planning to go to college soon, but I'm facing crippling debt in the future.","Okay. A little backstory:

I graduated in 2012 and then took some time off to work to earn some savings. My first job was a failure (part-time, but working 12 hour days at minimum wage, no overtime) so as a last resort I took a fast food job. I worked for tips and made less than $10,000 annually under a super shitty franchise owner. I worked there for a year and a half with little to no benefits, so I didn't save much. I quit in July for family reasons and because they didn't give any PTO, let alone time off, I had to quit.

Last December I moved out of my parents home and in with my boyfriend (now husband) and friend into a 2 bedroom apartment. The set up wasn't bad, and we had it really good at first. Long story short, roomate is immature and financially irresponsible. He quit his well-paying job to jump around temp agencies for... some reason I have yet to understand, and couldn't come up with his portion of money multiple times. Fearing eviction, more charges and bad credit I ended up covering things a couple of time. Drained my savings.

Then, last month, I got married. That drained quite a bit of money as well. My husband got fired from his job while I was taking care of family matters. So we were both out of a job. We are now currently working an overnight shift at a Target (no worries, we have no problems working together). We are getting paid better now but I'm still only making approximately $12,000 annually. 

Now about school. While I was at my shitty fast food job, I felt awful. Miserable. I felt like a lazy piece of shit. So I jumped the gun and applied to my dream school. I got accepted and started applying for scholarships. I only got one, from the school for a very small amount, plus a small federal grant. My very poor parents paid for my enrollment because they wanted to help with something. It was alot for them.

The school is out of state. On the plus-side, it's private so it doesn't cost any extra than in-state. On the down-side it's private. The cost is enormous. 

Now, I'm scared. I'm looking at a bill for over $7,000 due December 1st that was just sent me. This is for the semester after all my financial aid. I opted to live off-campus because it's out of state and the dorm was just as expensive anyways. I don't have a car. I will be living alone because my husband has to stay in our home state because he's already committed to a few things here. I will be looking at nearly a $30,000 loan for just this year if I go. But if I don't, I feel like I never will. 

My family says to get the loans, worry about paying them off later. My husband says ""Don't go."" I know this is what I want to do, but I don't want to kill myself doing it. It's too late for any more scholarships, and my family legitimately pay for anything else. The apartment's lease ends in January and that's when I'm scheduled to leave for school.

$5,500 @ 4.5% (federal)  


(the principal amounts to $281k, the remaining 50k ballooned from accruing interest).

r/personalfinance, I need your help about the best course of action to take with respect to paying off this debt. Here's a breakdown of my monthly, post-tax salary, subtracted by sunk costs (rent, utilities, etc)


Monthly, post-tax salary: $7600.


Rent: -$1825


Utilities: $-200


Groceries: $-300
  

After sunk costs, I'm left with $5,275 (for simplicity's sake, let's say $5k). 

How do you think I should allocate the remaining funds b/t paying off debt and saving for the future? I haven't put anything from my salary towards the 401(k), thinking that loans are a priority and should be paid off first. Plus, my employer does not match my 401(k), which is a further disincentive.  Do you think that's a good plan, or should I at least have some money saved up, either in a 401(k) or something with more growth potential, like an index fund? Likewise, do you think that refinancing the private loans, especially that 11% interest monster, is a good idea? I do have good credit (other than the debt), as I've been punctual with paying off bills fully as they became due.

I sincerely appreciate any advice or help you may offer. Even if you don't have time to respond, I would be very grateful if you could point me in the right direction for useful information (a book, a blog, any source that could enlighten me about this situation). I'm just starting my career, and I want nothing more than to make the right financial decisions for my future.

Thank you in advance for your time!

personalfinance,[Texas] Trying to get my plan grounded. Need help.,"See my post history and understand that I attempted a last minute move to Olathe, KS in Kansas City from Austin because my kids live with their mother there.  She just remarried and moved there.  I thought because of my problem with my roommate, I could go ahead and move out.  But as I made my way to Kansas City, I got into a car accident while hauling my stuff in the Uhaul trailer.  

My SUV is totalled (undriveable).  I rear ended someone else. It's possible that it would turn into my fault and I had liability insurance coverage on it.  My friend came up with her SUV and was able to pull the trailer back to where I moved out of.  

My other roommate said it was okay for me to stay here.  But the hostile roommate was nasty to me through texting.  Also I am actually located in Round Rock which doesn't seem to have friendly public transportation options.

I am waiting for the insurance adjustor to call me back and I am hoping to convince her that I should be covered by the uninsured coverage because the other driver didn't have driver license and possibility had expired insurance as well.  But I need to look at the option that it would be possible that the insurance won't cover it.

I only have $1,100 in the bank at this moment.  I had $250 deposit made for my room. I surrendered it because of my last minute move out but however, my female roommate said it was okay for me to pay $250 this month to cover the $500 rent.  I have been paying $500 a month for the last couple of months for this room.

I am looking at the option of moving further into the Austin city where the public transportation options are more better.  I am actually afraid that I may become broke after I move there because I would have to pay up front for the rent plus possible security deposit.

My income is based on SSDI because of my deafness.  I pull in $1500 a month.  My usual bills are the rent ($500), insurance coverage ($64 a month) for my SUV, iphone $45 a month (deaf plan), and netflix.  My usual spending for food has been $400 (home based cooking with crock pot, cast iron pan, etc), gas was like $200 a month.

I got a call from Fedex, just before I made the move to Kansas City, when they asked if I would like to come and work for them as package handler at 4 am until 8 am.  I have not called back because I made my decision to move to Kansas City.  With common sense, I would take the job but my transportation is more difficult. It's like an hour of walk to get there.  And winter is coming for Texas.

If I get a job and keep the income under $1,000 a month, it won't affect my SSDI.

I have already spent about $600 (including towing charges, gas money for myself and my friend) with unknown possible charges for the Uhaul trailer to be returned to the wrong destination instead of Olathe, KS.

Starting in January, I will be working at a new co-op employment for 8-months, making approximately $3500 per month (gross), or $28,000 total over the course of the 8 months. I have approximately $12,000 in savings. I will be living at home for the 8-months, so I will have no/minimal expenses in terms of rent/food. However, I will require access to a car in order to be able to get to work (it's about a 20-minute drive away, and in the middle of nowhere so there is no public transit). 

I am expecting to owe around $20,000 in government student loans when I graduate in April 2016. My province has a 6-month no-interest period after graduating for paying back loans. Unfortunately I'm not sure exactly what the interest rate will be once it starts accumulating... but I was hoping to be able to pay that back as quickly as possible.

The problem is, I don't know very much about cars, and don't know anyone very well that has a great knowledge of cars. I have seen a lot of people suggest buying a ~$3k beater car, but I am *very* concerned that I wouldn't be aware enough of the potential issues involved in taking care of a car like that, or even being able to tell whether a car is in decent condition or not. I think it would be a better idea for me to buy a &lt;$10k used car (preferably something reliable like a Toyota Corolla). However, I would want the car to be able to last at least 5 years (preferably more) if I spend that much money on it. My other option is to buy new and finance it, but the costs seem to very quickly add up when I consider that option.

I would appreciate if anyone could advise me towards how much I can feasibly spend on a car based on my assets. Should I buy used or spend the extra money on a new car that is more likely to last me a long time (5-10 years)? If I do buy a ~$10k used car, should I pay cash and leave myself with very little savings left, or should I make a reasonable down-payment and finance the rest?

Thank you very much in advance if you take the time to read/reply to this thread. I apologize if it isn't in the right place.

Edit: I also wanted to mention that I don't yet have a job lined up for when I graduate. I am hoping I might be able to return to the company I will be working at in January, but I am not sure what their policy is with that. I do have the option of returning to one of my previous employments, but that was across the country (in Alberta vs. Ontario) - but that is more of a last resort (and might cause issues if I have an older car that can't make it across the country).",finance,1415470444
personalfinance,"Am about to come into $6200. Have a private student loan of $7250 (including interest), and federal loans. Need advice.","Hi and thank you in advance for helping.

I graduated last spring with a B.S. in geology and a B.S. in biology. Because of my huge debt burden I decided to forego grad school, which I really really wanted to pursue. However, the stress was really killing me. I recently started working for the government, and intending to do PSLF. I do not make much in terms of take home pay. I started working at my current job in August and I estimated that if I work there for 1 FULL year I will have an AGI of about $26k and take home pay of $22k. I made about $6k in AGI from my previous job. 

So I have in student loans about $28k (no interest) in federal, a $2500 perkins loan, and a private loan that was $6k when I took it out with interest now it is $7250. 

My living expenses are fairly cheap. I pay an average of $355 a month for rent, utilities, internet etc. And I budget out $140 a month for anything other than food and gas which I usually spend around $250 a month for. In addition I have a car which is a bit of a junker and can be costly to repair (to me at least). I currently have about $9k in the bank.

I am about to enter repayment and set up IBR for which I am to pay $140/month. Not unbearable but a little upsetting since the online calculators said I would pay less. 

So I am worried the most about the private loan because of it's high interest. 

I am about to come into $6200. I have no idea what to do because I have not lived with this money in mind. I could pool it into my private loan and nearly be done with it, but I feel a little weird about doing that for some reason.

I work part-time and my income is about $15k a year. I have a job lined up for me post-graduation. However, I don't know the salary yet. 

I don't really have any expenses (sans gas and eating lunch every Friday with my coworkers), since I live with my parents, but I do plan on putting at least $500 a month for rent when I graduate. I'd do it now, but I accidentally claimed Exempt on my taxes when I joined my new company, so I'm withholding almost my entire paycheck to pay State and Federal taxes. 

Here's how my money is looking right now:

1. Each paycheck, I contribute 15% to my current company's 401k. I'm about to roll-over $2400 from my old employer (I switched companies in May). I also contribute 5% to my company's Roth 401k. 
2. After reading up jcollinsnh and Mr. Money Mustache for a weekend, I created a Vanguard account about two weeks ago, and deposited $10.2k into VTSAX from my savings account. 
3. I currently have about 45k in my Capital One 360 account (after moving $10.2k). 

I do not have any sort of IRA, and that's one of my questions. How does taxing work with the Vanguard account I have with VTSAX? If I understand correctly, I don't get taxed until I withdraw all of it? 
I've seen on Boglehead's forum that it is ""tax efficient"", but I have no idea what that means for filing my taxes. What else can I do to achieve FI? 

Finally, I've made a mock-up of how I plan to spend my money post-graduation: 

05%- Move to ING Direct

14%- Taxes
15%- 401k
25%- Vanguard VTSAX-	25%
36%- Live Off (Includes IRA, Rent, and Car Insurance, other expenses)

TLDR: I know it's a long post and my apologies. I just want to make sure I'm doing this right. I have a Vanguard account with $10k in VTSAX, Capital One 360 with 45k, max out my 401k contribution (but 15%), participate in a Roth 401k as well. Anything else I can add?",finance,1415471691

personalfinance,"Dad was just offered a pension buyout, and we have some questions. Like how to decipher a PBGC table we found, or how to figure out if it's a decent deal. Details inside.","**TL;DR**: Can anyone explain the numbers in this [this PBGC table](http://www.pbgc.gov/prac/interest/vls.html) and how to use them when analyzing a pension buyout offer?

-----------------------

Hi everyone,

&amp;nbsp;

My dad is thinking about retiring next year, and he recently got a letter in the mail from his employer’s pension office.

&amp;nbsp;

They’re offering him the opportunity to take a lump sum payment (and roll it into an IRA) instead of taking one of the usual annuity options --- if he retires in the next few months. Lump sum buyouts like this aren’t always offered since it depends on a plan’s funding level, so he’s trying to figure out if he should retire during the window &amp; take the lump sum. I thought I’d turn to the great folks of /r/personalfinance for some help. (Specific numbers at bottom of post).

&amp;nbsp;

By many accounts his employer is in decline (if I said it’s name and you live in the US, you’d probably agree), but their pension plan [is covered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation](http://search.pbgc.gov/search/InsuredPlans/InsuredPlans). I guess it's like the FDIC, but for pensions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Should the growing possibility that his company will have financial troubles in the coming years play any role in his decision on lump sum vs. annuity?**

Worst case is that PBGC takes over the plan, right? Now, I've looked at [what the PBGC guarantees](http://www.pbgc.gov/wr/benefits/guaranteed-benefits.html) and it says it covers monthly payments a lot higher than what he'd be getting. But during the initial PBGC takeover, could everyone's pensions be reduced regardless??

&amp;nbsp;

**How do we determine what % interest he'd need to meet or beat each year to make the lump sum last and beat the annuity option?**

I think if he were to take the lump sum, he’d have to meet or beat a certain % interest each year to make the lump sum worth it. How would we go about determining that %? Is it in the PBGC table we found? (see next point)

&amp;nbsp;

**Can anyone explain the numbers in [this PBGC table on Interest Rates for Determining Lump Sums](http://www.pbgc.gov/prac/interest/vls.html) ?**

It seems like a very useful table for analyzing the offer. Problem is, we have no idea what the values mean, or what formula(s) they plug into. Anyone know?

&amp;nbsp;

Below are some numbers that his employer is estimating. A few quick things - he is married and would probably take the “100% Joint and Survivor w/ 10 years guaranteed payments” if he were to go the annuity route. My folks have no debts, so there’s no immediate need for the cash (other than the peace of mind knowing they have it). And I’m their only kid, and I do not need, nor do I expect any inheritance from them in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

Lump sum offer: $127,000

100% J&amp;S annuity w/ 10 yrs guaranteed: $662/month

&amp;nbsp;

I'm super curious on the PBGC table and the formula(s) used when calculating a pension lump sum buyout offer, because I think that might be the key to understanding this whole thing, and could help others in the future figure out if their buyout offer is a decent deal.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,24 years old and a poor financial track record. Looking to change that.,"I'm just a bit lost in life in general, but I'm hoping you all can right me towards a better financial situation for the future.

I've been going to college for the past 5 years, changing majors four times, never obtaining a degree. I have ~120 credits and roughly 275k student debt to show for it. My loan deferment ends in about 3 months, and I'm concerned about how that will affect my situation.

**EDIT**: I should clarify, that is about 30k in federal loans in my name, and the rest in the Parent PLUS loans under my parents name.

I make about 1200/mo cleared as a bike mechanic, working 30-35 hr/wk. I have two credit cards; one from Citi at 11.99% with a ~$1500 balance, and one from Chase at 15.99% with a ~3k balance.

I also have typical bills which sum to ~260/mo (utilities, phone, internet).

I'm sick of using my money irresponsibly. What should my plan of action be here?

**EDIT:** Thank you for your replies. As another option, could I not just transfer to a relatively inexpensive state college and finish my degree? My loan payments would be deferred until I finish, no?

**LAST EDIT**: As per your recommendations, I went home today and spoke to my parents. They were in fact well aware of the situation, and have been preparing for some time now. The have an unwavering faith in me, I am incredibly lucky to have them. I've been so, so selfish with their trust, but that ends today. On a positive note, I was off on my 260k number by a considerable margin. My loans total closer to 160k, which is still a daunting sum, but still relatively good news. I think I'm going to be ok.

We have been renting out all the other rooms in the house in order to stay here. My parents have moved back home and we have released all the renters and my parents dont want us living here anymore. So we have 2 options really. 

Find a place to rent or find a place to buy.

I was laid off last month, (construction industry) but If needed I could pick up even a low paying position to help supplement. 

On the other hand my wife makes about $6k per month gross. and about $4k take home.

we have saved up $22k 
Both cars are paid off ( both are in good condition)
Cell phones are roughly $70 per month
health insurance is about 300 per month
student loans ($25k) are about 300 per month but we overpay and do $600 per month to help pay them down faster
she commutes about 130 miles for work 4-5 days a week and spends probably 300-350 per month in gas.

now Rent seems high right now where we currently live and Low near her work. 
$1400 per month will get you a 1500 sqft 2bed 2 bath here were we live currently  
or $1500 per month will get you 1000 sqft 2bed 2 bath close to her work 

to me it makes more since to move close to her work and rent if we are going to rent because she can save money in gas and possibly utilities as its near the ocean and much cooler.

If we buy we would be looking for something out where we currently live and she would continue to commute. Homes are fairly cheap avg. 260k for a 3bed 2 bath 1700 sqft home.

you couldn't even find a small condo for that price by her work.

if we got a loan to buy our interest rate would be high as she is just now repairing her credit from some overdue medical bills and such.

based on a small spread sheet i put together. 

Renting (excluding gas and utilities/groceries ect.) would cost roughly 20k per year. 

buying at 5.5% interest (excluding gas and utilities/groceries ect.) would cost roughtly 14k per year. after tax incentives. that would be what I consider rent as its going all to interest/property tax, insurance and PMI. it does not include paying anything to the principle.

My question deals only with the 401k account, as it doesn't have the income restrictions that are inherent to the IRA.  Anyway...

My current situation is that I make enough that I'm into the 28% federal tax bracket.  With a possible year end bonus, I *could* get into the 33% bracket.  I also currently live in a state with a 6% top tax bracket, which I am solidly in.  I'm still currently contributing to my Roth 401k, with the assumption that my income will only increase as I progress, but my wife and I have a five year plan that includes moving to another state which has **no** state income tax.  

If I'm thinking about this correctly, especially assuming I make it to the 33% tax bracket, my best choice is to begin contributing to a traditional account, ""saving"" the 6% state income tax.  Then once I'm in the no income tax state, I will contribute once again to the Roth account, and make up the difference, thus locking in that 6% savings.  I say especially if I'm in the 33% bracket because at worst, if my income increases significantly, I may end up in a 39.6% federal tax bracket in the no income tax state, which is roughly break even at that point.  In this case, I think I'd have enough to save that the 0.6% difference wouldn't make much of an impact and I don't see this as likely.  More likely, I end up remaining in the 33% fed tax bracket and ""saving"" six percent in state taxes on my contributions over the next five or so years.

I hope my rambling isn't too incoherent.  Where am I going wrong?  Or is this a viable tax strategy to save some money?",finance,1415550741
personalfinance,"Transferring Money From Fidelity to Bank, What Steps Do I Have To Take?","Hi guys, 

Quick question on stocks &amp; taxes. 

So I had $18k worth of stocks in my Fidelity account. These stocks were given to me as a child, and I have been holding them since. I decided to sell them in order to put the money towards my $80k in student loans. 

I am in the 10% federal tax bracket, so I owe 0% capital gains tax, right? 

My question is: What extra steps do I have to take? I will be transferring $18,000 to my bank account and then straight towards student loans. Do I have to file paperwork with the IRS ahead of time? I just don't want there to be any backfire from transferring a lot of money.

personalfinance,"Debt Prioritization, Retirement, and Car Questions","Hey /r/personalfinance! Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Through my lurking over the past 1.5 years, I have made some substantial changes for the better when it comes to my personal finances - so thank you for your awesome advice!

As the title suggests, I have some questions regarding what my next steps should be for debt prioritization vs retirement, and an additional question about cars that sort of ties into the whole debt and retirement question. But first, some background info:

### Background

## Personal

* I'm 30, married (wife is 31), and have no kids.
* We currently rent an apartment.
* We are planning on moving to a different state next summer because we are not happy in the state we currently live in (for multiple reasons). We will rent when we move. My job doesn't care where I live, so we're trying to figure out where we want to put down roots before we have kids and while we have this flexibility.

## Financial

**Wife**

* Wife does not currently work (this will be changing soon) and has no real retirement savings.
* Wife does have student loans, but has been diligently paying them off on her own through her savings (without tapping into her own $1000 emergency fund). This reminds me, I need to ask her the details on these loans - interest rates, etc. She should have 4 years left on them at her current repayment rate.

**Retirement**

* I have a 401k through work that matches 0.5% for the first 6%. I'm contributing the full match amount (yay free money!).
* We have no other forms of retirement currently.

**Debt**

* We have no credit card debt, or any debt other than student loans and a car lease.

**Student Loans**

4 | Stafford | $6,628.45 | 6.55% | Unknown

**Cars**

* My wife's car is a 2003 Malibu and is paid off.
* My car is a 2012 Subaru Legacy and is on lease. The lease is over on January 28, 2016.
* For fun, I ran a payoff quote this morning using a zip code in the area that we're looking to move to. The payoff quote came to $17,165.81. Granted, I would expect this to go down between now and the end of the lease.

Here's what we're looking at for general costs of the cars. This does not include fuel or estimated maintenance.

 | Payment | Tags/Taxes | Insurance | Total $/month
 :--:|--:|--:|--:|--:
Subaru | $298.94  | $21  | $52  | $371.94 
Malibu | $0  | $5  | $49  | $54.00 


**Savings**

* Both the wife and I have (separate - we only have one joint account that we use to transfer money back and forth) $1000 emergency funds.
* I have 1 month of living expenses saved up ($3265) on top of the $1000 emergency fund.
* Currently saving for moving costs. Savings goal is $8000 (although I certainly hope the apartment hunting trip + move doesn't cost this much!). We're on-target to meet this goal 1 month prior to the move date.

### The Questions

Back when I had credit card debt, I was using the snowball approach to paying off debt. After the credit cards were gone, we decided to move. So, I've been just throwing the snowball at that, which equals out to $650/mo. The root of the questions I have ultimately come down to ""What do I do with this $650/mo after we move?""

## Retirement vs Loans

Time is currently on our side when it comes to retirement, so I'm feeling some pressure to get an IRA started in order to best take advantage of this. However, some of my interest rates are pretty high, and given that paying off the loans is like a guaranteed rate of return on an investment, I'm inclined to just throw the money at the 6.x% and 5.x% loans first. Would you recommend this?

On a related note, do you see a way for me to consolidate any loans to lower my interest rate?

## Cars

*Background:* My first car purchase (a used 2003 VW Passat) was a disaster. It started running into mechanical issues that the mechanics couldn't figure out. After dumping ~$3000 into that POS, I decided to just look into getting a different car. I was still $2000 underwater on that loan (stupid high APR plus $0 downpayment plus a stupid younger me = that bad situation). They took my VW in as a trade-in and paid it off completely, knocked some $$ off of the sticker price of the Subaru, and lowered the interest rate on the lease terms. What I walked out with was a new car and a lower (by about $25) monthly payment than I had on my VW. Given how little I drive, it made perfect sense at the time.

Given that the wife's car is paid off (but not quite as mechanically sound as my car - I'd guess we have maybe 2 years of use out of it before we have to put more $$ into it than it's worth) we are debating on what to do. I'm currently budgeting $105/mo for car maintenance based on our driving habits and age of the vehicles. This is intended to cover mechanical issues as well as tires, oil changes, etc.

So, do you think we should sell her car, get rid of my car (after the lease is up), or plan to keep both? Dropping down to 1 car will likely be very inconvenient after we move due to the both of us needing to work and likely being on very different schedules. The up side to the schedule issue is that I tend to work from home or fly to a client site...and I could take a shuttle to the airport.

## Further Emergency Fund

I'd love to get to a 6 month emergency fund. I have a stable job in a stable field, so I'm not really worried about not being able to find work. But, I'd also rather be prepared than not. My assumption would be to fund this after the student loans are paid off. Do you agree? How do you see this fitting into the larger picture with the cars, retirement, and loans?",finance,1415552941

personalfinance,Made the mistake of cosigning my ex-fiancees student loans and taking out a loan for a car.,"Hey Guys, I'm a regular poster here but I'm using a throwaway because of how embarrassingly bad I goofed up.

Also, please know that I harbor no ill feelings towards my ex and any mean or hurtful comments are NOT appreciated or helpful.

Anyways, I'll try to be brief. For about 2 years, I was engaged to someone I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with, otherwise I never would have made these decisions. 6 months ago she was diagnosed with mood disorder. Long story short that mood disorder made her a risk to herself, she constantly would talk about hurting herself and this of course worried me. Her biggest concern was dropping out of school and in an naive attempt to help someone I loved, I did everything I could to make sure that didn't happen. Part of that help consisted of co-signing her student loans and taking a car loan out for her so she'd be able to get to school and work (she's had trouble keeping a job in the past). Part of me had the horrible fear that she would hurt herself if something happened to her education and the other part of me did it under the assumption this woman would be my wife and we could deal with the finances together.

Heres where it gets complicated. After a while of visiting doctors she finally got on meds that started helping. Everything was going fine and then one day she leaves me. She told me it was because she had to figure out school and work and I lived to far for the commute and coupled with my work schedule we'd never see each other. I was sad but I understood that and took it as a good sign that her new meds were working and she was finally able to start setting her priorities straight. I told her that as long as she continued to make payments on everything I'd continue to help for 6 more months while she looked for a new co-signer and refinanced the car. 
A week later I found out she had been cheating on me the better half of our relationship and was already with someone new. Obviously this caused a lot of trust issues that could no longer allow me to trust her to not screw me over on everything. So I called her and told her everything needs to be taken care of ASAP or I'll need to sell the car. Anyways, she was unable to get the car refinanced and now is returning the car to me. I know I have to sell it obviously and bite the cost of the damages she did to it (they're lower than my insurance deductible). But what I'm more concerned about is her ability to remove me as a co-signer on the loans. I figure since she herself (and the people who she tried to get help her refiance) doesn't have good enough credit to get a loan for a 14k car, I can imagine getting a new co-signer for the loans will be quite difficult. 

What are my options here as far as the co-signing goes? Am I stuck because of a stupid decision I made as over stressed emotional wreck?",finance,1415555196

Bitcoin,What many of us don't get about Bitcoin (its biggest strength).,"Are you worried about the trolls, the Professor Bitcorn and BitCon types the media books on their shows, while ignoring people like Andreas, Roger, TwoBitIdiot, Circle execs, the Xapo CEO - all of whom would be better representatives of the technology and the currency.

Look, these people are playing their game: they don't want Bitcoin to succeed.

Allow me to repeat that: they do not want Bitcoin to succeed.

For people in the media, especially television, who already have money - they don't want to hear the Bitcoin narrative. They really don't. They're busy and being told their millions are worthless fiat shit bothers them. People don't like change - we couldn't even switch to the metric system in the States. This turns money around, a full 180. Some aren't ready for that.

And the credit card companies, the banks, some governments... Bitcoin is not a thorn in their side. It's an existential threat and, as with Occupy, they're doing their thing to make it go away. How much of the regulatory and legislative shitstorm do you think has been generated by card company lobbyists whispering into the right people's ears? Think about it.

This stuff is not conspiracy thinking. It is economic war. They're threatened, and they are attempting to crush that threat. 

I was never in Occupy, I found it pedantic, but a friend was. Recently we were talking and I told her ""something like that was doomed from the get go - no clear demands, no clear leaders, no vision"".

This led to a very scary conversation about her experiences in Occupy. She's one of the smarter people I know, definitely not a UFO/conspiracy/NWO conspiratard. And she said, point blank, it was her experience that *at least* 1 out of every 4 ""Occupiers"" by the end of it was a fed, undercover cop, or provocateur. None of it made sense toward the end - crazies showing up to meetings, advocating violence and property damage. People with no history in activist communities whatsoever popping up with recording equipment, not journalists mind you, and asking questions and taking face shots without permission.

All that scary Cointelpro shit they used against Martin Luther King, Jr and others whose views were a little too ahead of the curve?

Those programs have not ended, they have just been compartmentalized and in many cases privatized. Internet trolling is big business. Social engineering and opinion ""shepherding"" is also big business.

Why do banks advertise on TV so much? Why do they sponsor so many stadiums?

The Buttcoiners frequently say Bitcoin is a cult. Money IS a cult: flip around a dollar bill, you'll find more occult creepiness than in the last twenty minutes of *Eyes Wide Shut*. 

Money is a psychological phenomena, and Satoshi got the economics right for duplicating that phenomena, without needing a government to kickstart it with all of their imagery, force, and bullshit.

One of the recent favorite lines of Bitcoin detractors is ""the blockchain technology is great, but the currency side of it will never work"".

This is intentional, one last attempt to undermine Bitcoin in the courts of public opinion.

""The engines on this plane are great, but it will never fly.""

Wrong. Currency, value transfer, is the whole fucking point of Bitcoin. Notice how the trolling increased as Changetipping took off? That's because if tipping goes viral, the threat to them increases - it cannot be stopped at that point.

Also, sorry it took me so long to get to the point of this post: **Bitcoin's biggest strength IS its currency aspect.**

All the rest is nice bells and whistles, but currency is what Bitcoin was designed to replace. As Gates said, ""Bitcoin is *better* than currency."" He's not a dumb guy. That's one of those five word quotations that doesn't seem like much today, but in three years will appear positively prophetic in its accuracy. Bitcoin isn't just another currency. It's not just some card network for transferring ledger credit/debit balances around. It's a technology inherently better than govt-issued currency itself, just as email is inherently better than the post.

The logical conclusion, therefore, is that price does matter. Sellers - each of us - decide the price of Bitcoin. Given how much bullshit they are throwing at the wall lately trying to slow us down, I no longer recognize Bitcoin as a $350, $500, or $1,000 per coin technology. 

It's become personal. I'll HODL until the bastards are out of business. Because if more of us thought like that, Bitcoin fairy tale time would be here a lot sooner. These banks and institutions are begging to be put out of business. And they know it, or the trolls and media shills wouldn't be out in force. 

Time to finish the job. HODL til the bleed. For every shill who says price doesn't matter and Bitcoin will never work as money, I say it *is* money - more money than your derogatory surveillance and war funding Chuck E Cheese notes, more money than the heavy metal our predecessors used to have to lug around. 

And price does matter. The detractors will see that this holiday season. Satoshi built a brilliant Chinese finger trap for money: it won't take much fresh seasonal demand to send all these numbers astronomical.

And I think enough of us are pissed off that we won't sell when things heat up. That's when it gets fun. To quote my favorite Bond villain, ""Hello, James. Welcome. Do you like the island? My grandmother had an island. Nothing to boast of. You could walk around it in an hour, but still it was, it was a paradise for us. One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait and the rats would come for the coconut and... they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you have trapped all the rats, but what do you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it and they begin to get hungry. And one by one... they start eating each other until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what? Do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees, but now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now, they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us.""

We're going to change their nature. We want it badder than they do, and the future is ours.",cryptocurrency,1415559326
personalfinance,Any suggestions on paying a few things off?,"Looking for a few suggestions on whether or not I should use a portion of my savings to pay a few things off, or let them run their scheduled course. Just to give you some insight to my finances:

•Salary: about $104k/yr

•Monthly after taxes: $5,500

•Currently have $30k emergency savings, would prefer not to touch

•Have another almost $10k savings, which is what I'd like to use to pay a few things down

•$500/mo goes directly to savings, $400 goes to an IRA (nearly maxed out for the year) - not sure the relevancy of this info though

**What I'm looking to pay down/off**

•Federal Student Loans: $7650 @ 6.8% - I pay about $50/mo, and they're split into two separate halves

•Amazon card - $1808 (but I cannot find the APR for some reason, I imagine it's more than I want to carry) - I pay about $100-$400/mo, depending on what I buy

•Motorcycle - $2008 @ 2.9% - I pay about $80/mo

•I also have about $77k in additional student loans that I put about $575/mo toward, but they're at 3% and I'd prefer to get the smaller ones paid down first

Of course, paying the cycle and Amazon card will save me more per month now, the Student loans are the biggest culprit IMO. Maybe I pay the two smaller bills above and get more aggressive with the student loans?

personalfinance,Home Loan Question,"Hi reddit! I'm a long time lurker, first time poster.

I have been married to my current spouse for a little over a year. My spouse currently has multiple rental properties (titled in a trust name), and then his homestead (titled in his name). He currently is in the process of refinancing his rental properties mortgages to lower his interest rates.

He said that because the property he lives in is his homestead he can get a lower rate on it than he can on the rest of his rental properties, because of this he wants to take cash out (around $80,000) from his homestead to pay down his rental properties.

Here is where we are running into the problem. Because we are married would I be liable for some of this debt if something were to happen (death, divorce, ect)? I am just a bit concerned that although my name is not on anything, I would suddenly be saddled with a large amount of debt if something were to happen.

As a bit more information I have been living in the house the same amount of time he has (around 4-5 years), and I have been paying 50% of the rent during this time as well. Only his name is on the mortgage, as well as on the title. The state that we live in is Texas.",finance,1415571368
investing,Long term interest rates thoughts?,"I'm starting to let the cash pile up.  I was thinking about paying off the house and taking the 3.8% return (before tax write offs).  I also was going to wait until I had enough liquid cash to write a single check.  I suspect it will be in about one year.

Part of me still thinks I'm an idiot for paying off such a low rate.  One side of me is saying put it in a mix of large cap dividend payers, bcds, and reits.  Over the next 30 years if I only get 3.8% annual return out of the market that will be pretty disappointing.  If I'm in large cap dividend payers paying ~4% dividends that means the market has run about flat for 30 years.  I don't consider that very likely but who knows.

The other part of me is saying if rates stay low I'd be better off opening an account at IB and buying on margin.  By investing this ""house money"" and not paying on the loan I'm basically investing at 3.8% margin rates.  IB has ~1% margin rates.  The difference is my home loan is fixed and not subject to margin calls while IB is variable.  Again if rates stay low I'd be better paying on the house.

While what happened in the USA wasn't nearly as bad as Japan it was pretty bad.  Europe has taken a big shit as of late.  QE is done but 30 year Tbills haven't really budged.

I just don't think rates are going to rise much in the next 10 years.  Again while I don't think the USA is bad as Japan, Japan has been in a zero rate environment for 20+ years.  I further don't think rates will rise because if they do rise housing prices will take another giant shit.  The states and counties have been jacking up the tax levy to make up for the drop in home prices.  If mortgage rates go up you can afford less house.  Using rough numbers if rates go from 4% to 5% you are looking at about 200 less per month you can spend on a purchase price on a 200k house.  You'd need a 20% drop in housing price.  That means the house would need to then sell for 160k to get back to the 800 per month payment.

Thoughts?  Pay off the house?  First world investor problems I suppose but 100k at 3.8% vs 10% is 6.2k a year which is a decent chunk of change.

I just think we are going to be in grind for quite some time.  I don't think rates are going to go up and I don't think we are going to see the market pop up a whole lot more.  I also don't really see it dropping.  Long term as the boomers head to nursing homes I'm sort of bearish to flat on housing.  All of this sort of leads to believe we will be in ZIRP for quite a while.  The fed can talk about upping rates all it wants but it just doesn't seem to be happening nor does the economic data seems to support it.  I think this last go round might leave a 10 to 20 year spending change on how people handle their money.  People are literally burning money in savings to keep it out of the market.  People aren't spending like they used to either.",finance,1415571708

personalfinance,"After working 5 years in Australia, I am coming home to the USA... what to do with my AUD savings?","Hello Finance folks!

I am new here. I have read through the FAQ and done my best to wrap my mind around basic PF concepts, though I have to admit I struggle with comprehension and focus when it comes to numbers, percentages, and other essential components of understanding finance... however, I have done my best to get the basics set in my mind before coming with my question. I'm really sorry if I put too much information here, I just didn't want to skip anything that might be relevant... so thank you for listening! 

My question is about how to transfer, or if I should transfer, my savings, which are currently in Australian dollars. Thus far, I left home around 17 years old and traveled for many years before settling these last 5 or so in Australia, where I have been working full time at a great job, on a proper work visa. I have not lived in the USA in any meaningful way, financially, as an adult... I have worked odd jobs and restaurant jobs here and there between travels. 

I am 28 years old. I don't believe I have an American 401k account. I have never done my taxes in the US (I do them here in Australia every year.) I have no debt. My credit seems to be ok - I tried to do a credit check and 2 companies were fine, but 1 company was alarming. However I felt that the way they were alarming felt like a scam - they were asking for money - and confirmed this scam via research. I never got my credit score for that company, so I don't know it it's ok.

My savings here in Australia are at $30k AUD. When I leave, I will withdraw my Superannuation (retirement fund) - it's currently at $16k AUD, and I believe there's a 30% penalty for withdrawing it. 

At this point in my life, I am ready to come home and settle in. I want my ducks in a row. 

Does it make sense to leave my money in Australia, where perhaps it might grow with better interest rates than I can get in the US, or wait for a day when the exchange rates are better? If I were to transfer right now, it looks like my fancy $30k is a measly $25k in USD. Even though they are essentially the same, there's a weird feeling in going from $30k to $25k! (This is where emotional people like me probably fail at finances.)

Is there any chance of someone not-so-financially-minded like me to make my money grow by investing it with a bit of risk? I have seen mixed advice on here regarding financial advisers, and I have to say I'm scared to put my trust in someone whose interest in my money is not purely the fee I am paying, but how my investments can benefit them/their company.

personalfinance,(CA) Using RRSP towards Owner's Contribution for small business financing?,"Good evening! Just wondering if someone would be able to help 'demystify' the process/clarify whether it's possible to use RRSP funds towards an owner's contribution for a small business loan.

My spouse and I are looking to start a small business. It's a solid investment in a healthcare business, and all our numbers make sense. They more than make sense: all of our market research demonstrates our business concept is solid and we are very excited. Market conditions are very favourable as our two main competitors are hemorrhaging business and we stand to reap the benefits of their folly. Our small community is growing exponentially and its only a matter of time before someone else comes in if we don't open soon.

What stands in our way is the sizeable requirement for the owner's contribution for our small business financing. Between my wife and I, we hold $100K in RRSPs and another $40K in her pension. We've been told that we can ""use our RRSPs as equity"", and even that we can use funds from an RRSP mortgage.. but information I'm finding online isn't so clear. We do have some savings, but not enough to cover the full amount. 

I just want to make sure that I understand my options before we sit down with a bank. I have also been told that some institutions might offer us 100% financing without the need for an owner's contribution, but we'll end up paying a considerably higher interest rate.

It's not quite enough to guarantee I can live the rest of my life without concern for my finances but it's close (let's just call it a million dollars).  I have no debts of any sort at this point. Here is the allocation I've been considering:

35% US equities

15% international equities

5% emerging equities

15% REIT

20% Bonds

The more mathematically inclined might notice that only adds to 90%. I'm looking for a reasonably safe investment with a reasonable return that isn't extremely correlated with the stock market for the final 10%. I would normally just have 30% bonds but with interest rates bound to rise eventually I hate to allocate that much of my portfolio to bonds. I'm not interested in commodities or gold.

I have just found out I am currently in line to inherit $300,000 as a trust fund. I have about $30,000 in university debt however the HECS help scheme charges a low interest rate so I am not too worried about repaying my debts immediately.

personalfinance,I need to figure out how to take care of my 8yr old niece,"I looked at the FAQ (never posted here before), I feel like this problem falls in several categories, i.e taxes/relationships. I'll try to keep it succinct.

Background: I have a niece who has been ""homeschooled"" since 1st grade by my disabled sister (her mother), who is a single mom living with my parents. The kid is 8 years old and should be in 3rd grade. I am extremely worried because my niece is not really learning anything. My sister does her best, but has problems that prevent her from being consistent in my niece's education. I am terrified that my favorite kid in the whole world is going to fall behind in school, never catch up, and that this could affect her long-term.

My sister agreed to send my niece to school, but only if it was private. I looked into it, and there are tuition assistance programs that would almost cover school in full for the daughter of a disabled single mom.

PF PROBLEM: The school's tuition assistance wants financial records, including tax information, that my sister has no clue about and seems to think doesn't apply to her. She had a brain tumor several years ago and hasn't been able to work since. She receives disability payments every month, but has never filed taxes or anything. The school requires:

Federal Form 1040, 1040A or 1040-EZ U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.

Copies of all 2014 W-2 Wage and Tax Statements for both the applicant and co-applicant. 

How do I get this stuff when my sister's income is all disability? Should she be filing taxes? Does she get W2s for disability income? I ask her this stuff and she blows it off/doesn't understand. If she hasn't filed taxes since she first got sick 8 years ago, how do I retroactively fix this? 

I don't want to get bogged down in all of my sister's financial stuff, my bottom line is getting my niece in school and making sure she's successful and happy. I would pay for it myself if I could, but I'm 23 and in college, I can barely pay my own bills.

FYI: If your solution is enroll the kid in public school, I've been arguing for two years about this, and my sister won't budge. It just isn't an option. 

TLDR: Niece is homeschooled but not learning anything, need to figure out how to get her tuition assistance for a private school. Her mom is disabled and hasn't filed taxes on her disability income.",finance,1415592273
personalfinance,IRS penalty for underpayment of estimated tax... quarterly estimated payments,"So I just want to get some verification that I am interpreting this IRS page correctly.  http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306.html

&gt;Generally, most taxpayers will avoid this penalty if they owe less than $1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits, or if they paid at least 90% of the tax for the current year, or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year, whichever is smaller.

So if the sum of all the federal tax withholdings from my 2014 paychecks exceeds the total amount of federal tax I owed for 2013, then I will not get an underpayment penalty.  This number is going to be smaller than 90% of the taxes I will owe for 2014.  But it says **generally**, which I don't get.

From reading http://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000194563
it sounds like I should have (or the IRS prefers that I would have paid quarterly estimated tax payments), but the language doesn't sound that strict.

personalfinance,"Just doubled my salary to 80k, need some advice on how best to proceed","Hi all! I don't visit this sub too much but I have a distinct need for its expertise now. I've been working in my industry for about 2.5 years (since college) and I've been making about 40k a year. This has been pretty comfortable, but I'm supporting my wife as well (she is working minimum wage) and we both have debts. So up until now we've been treading water financially and enjoying ourselves but have never managed to save up any money.

Well last week I got a job offer for 80k in a relatively cheap city in the midwest. This is honestly quite a shock, and was easily 20k more than I was hoping for. My wife and I are ecstatic, but now I find myself wondering what our plan of action should be financially. Here's our situation (2 20somethings, no kids):

    Income: 80k salary
    Student Loans: 35k
    Credit Card debt: 5k
    Car loan: 5k
    
After crunching some numbers I tried to come up with a monthly budget that looks generally something like:

    Income after tax, benefit deductions: 4,000
    Rent: 1,200
    Fixed costs (phones, insurance, utilities, gym, etc.): $650
    Debt payment: 1,150
    food, gas, everything else: $1000
    Whatever's left at the end of the month goes to debt payment.

So, my questions for you all:

1. For the debts, I'm going to be prioritizing the order I pay them down by interest rate. Just paying the minimums except for the debt with the highest APR. I figure this is a safe strategy since I won't have to worry about being able to pay all the minimums anymore. Is this a good strategy?

2. My plan is to pay off the credit cards and the car entirely before establishing any sort of emergency fund (CCs because of the APR, car loan because it's a loan from a family member and I want to get it paid ASAP). Is this a good plan, or are there reasons to save some money first? What would be a reasonable amount to have in an emergency fund?

3. My company will match 50% of my 401k contribution up to 6% of  total salary. Should I start investing right away, and if so, how much? Would it be better to aggressively pay off my debts first?

4. I listed $1,200 for rent above. This seems to be a pretty average figure for the area, the housing and apartment market there is really booming. I know this comes down to preference, but is 1200 a reasonable amount to pay on rent given my salary? What would you pay if it was you?

5. I'd love any other advice anyone can give, specific or general. Any info about pitfalls to watch out for, relevant investment/debt repayment tips... Anything is appreciated!

science,"Science AMA Series: I’m Ken Buesseler, an oceanographer who headed to Japan shortly after the explosions at Fukushima Dai-ichi to study ocean impacts and now I’m being asked -is it safe to swim in the Pacific? Ask me anything.","I’m Ken Buesseler, an oceanographer who studies marine radioactivity.  I’ve been doing this since I was a graduate student, looking at plutonium in the Atlantic deposited from the atmospheric nuclear weapons testing that peaked in the early 1960’s.  Then came Chernobyl in 1986, the year of my PhD, and that disaster brought us to study the Black Sea, which is connected by a river to the reactors and by fallout that reached that ocean in early May of that year.  Fast forward 25 years and [a career studying radioactive elements such as thorium that are naturally occurring in the ocean](http://cafethorium.whoi.edu), and you reach March 11, 2011 the topic of this AMA.  

The triple disaster of the 2011 “Tohoku” earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent radiation releases at Fukushima Dai-ichi were unprecedented events for the ocean and society.  Unlike Chernobyl, most of the explosive releases blew out over the ocean, plus the cooling waters and contaminated groundwater enter the ocean directly, and still can be measured to this day. 
Across the Pacific, ocean currents carrying Fukushima cesium are predicted to be detectable along the west coast of North America by 2014 or 2015, and though models suggest at levels below those considered of human health concern, measurements are needed.  That being said, in the US, no federal agency has taken on this task or supported independent scientists like ourselves to do this.  

In response to public concerns, we launched in January 2014 a campaign using crowd funding and citizen scientist volunteers to sample the west coast, from San Diego to Alaska and Hawaii looking for sign of Fukushima radionuclides that we identify by measuring cesium isotopes.    Check out http://OurRadioactiveOcean.org for the participants, results and to learn more.

So far, we have not YET seen any of the telltale Fukushima cesium-134 along the beaches.  However new sampling efforts further offshore have confirmed the presence of small amounts of radioactivity from the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant 100 miles (150 km) due west of Eureka.   What does that mean for our oceans? How much cesium was in the ocean before Fukushima?  What about other radioactive contaminants?  This is the reason we are holding this AMA, to explain our results and let you ask the questions.

investing,How i became a landlady,"I have always had this financial independence idea in the back of my head, ever since I started working and realizing that a normal, 9 to 5 job is not the thing for me. And when thinking about how to produce passive income, real estate was always on the top of my head.

This is how I was picturing things, back when there was no crisis, no bubble, easy lending… I would buy a first flat, earn a 10% return on it. It would be paid for by the rents, and after two years, I would go back to the bank, show that I was a successful landlady, ask for some more money, and repeat. By age 40, I would have a dozen properties, and live off my rental income for the rest of my life. Easy!

In real life, I graduated with a small savings account, and since the bank wouldn’t lend me a penny, I bought a very small flat that I found through propertywide.co.uk, and charged a very small rent, far from enough to cover my living expenses. Renting came with lots of troubles attached, like the tenant not paying rent for months at a time.

But the numbers were still good. I bought at $25,000, rented at $350 per month including $100 condo fees and maintenance, and after 9 years, I sold at $50000. You can see more numbers here.

Nonetheless, I felt like I could have achieved much more, had I had access to credit. I had no stable income or hefty savings to buy outright again, but I had the will to buy another property.

So I set my mind to achieving my goal. I needed stable income, ok, I got a job as an IT consultant. I dreaded the office, my work, but loved the paycheck and the fact that I was able to see myself progressing towards my goal. After working there for about 18 months, I went to the bank and asked for a mortgage. It was borderline since my income wasn’t super high and I was trying to buy in a high cost of living area, but after much bargaining and some luck since the interest rates were dropping and making my affordability higher, I got the keys to a brand new 3 bedroom flat.

My boyfriend moved in with me, and was paying part of the utilities, but since he didn’t have much of a job at the time, we took in a tenant immediately. We kept two rooms to ourselves, one for office/closet/guestroom, and one as our actual bedroom. After a few months, we realized that we were barely using the second room, and how much rental income we were missing out on.

In this area, a room rents for $750 or more. That is a lot of money! We would be able to do a lot more stuff every month with that cash in hand! Suddenly, the convenience of having two rooms seemed to bear a really high price tag. We put the room on the market, and were lucky to find an exchange student wanting to rent for a month. The idea was to try for a month, and decide after that. During that month, we didn’t miss the guestroom, and were very grateful for the cash.

Since then, I have moved out of the flat, and the three rooms are currently rented. I have been very lucky so far, my worst problem has been tenants not getting along, but I have never had a bad debtor.

Letting my flat was natural for me since I had always been living with roommates, or alone in shoebox apartments. So I had no trouble sharing the space. It was also great to be the landlady since I had a stronger say in house matters, or could get rid of someone in the eventuality of severe disagreements, something I wish I had been able to do with previous roommates.",finance,1415625119

Am I right in thinking you are just trading a flattening of the yield curve, basically shorting the spread by going long 10Y and short 1Y then balancing your portfolio to be duration neutral?

personalfinance,Credit Card Penalty Survey - This is why you shouldn't carry a balance.,"A [new survey](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/penalty-rate-survey.php) examines the penalty rates for different credit cards and how they assess penalties for balances that are carried over. The messed up thing is that card issuers are only required to disclose the penalty rate on monthly statements, **not** before you sign up. 

Some interesting stats:

&gt;Those who fall 60 days behind in credit card payments face an average penalty interest rate of 28.45 percent, according to CreditCards.com's survey of major 100 U.S. credit cards.

&gt;Sixty of 100 surveyed cards have a penalty interest rate of some kind: 28 have penalty APRs based on the prime rate plus a specified percent, 32 calculate a cardholder's penalty APR based on creditworthiness. Rates based on the prime rate can move up automatically when that index rises, as it is expected to in 2015.

This survey reaffirms the need to pay off your balance in full each month as the penalty rates are steep and the majority of credit card providers are charging at or as close as possible to the maximum rate allowed by Federal law. This is a great read and adds some significant data behind the mantra of pay off your balance in full each month.",finance,1415632026

This is my first post in this sub and I am looking to get some help setting up my finances.
Here is some background about me:
 

Just finished my mba and began work about a month and a half ago. I also just got married 2 months ago. For now I plan on keeping my wife’s finances separate. Right now I reside in Ontario Canada, also I have no savings as I have put everything towards my debt.
 

I have no significant credit card debt, but I do have quite a few other debts.


Student LOC - $79,700 @ 3.5%  (limit $80k)

Unsecured LOC - $8,600 @ 8% (limit $15k)

OSAP (student loan from undergrad) - $33,350 @ 5.5%
 

I make $86,000 a year on salary. My current biweekly pay cheques come out to about $2,200 (or $4,400 a month). My expenses are about $700 per two weeks, or about $1400 a month. This number does not include the payments on debt I am making. After my expenses I put all remaining money towards my debt (close to $3000 a month)
 

I make 2% deductions per pay towards DC pension plan, it is matched another 2% by the company
 

My goal so far has been to pay the Unsecured LOC as much as I can, while making minimal payments on the student LOC. I assumed with the higher interest rate on the unsecured, this was the best plan of action
My current OSAP payments are $500 a month (I plan on increasing them once unsecured is paid off)
 

Right now I have minimal expenses, and I would like to take this opportunity to not only pay off my debts but also to set myself up for savings in the long run. I understand that paying off my debt first is a better idea than saving money, and since these are LOCs I can always take money back out if I need it.
 

I also have a ton of education credits and interest payment credits to use for my tax return next year.
 

So my questions are:

- Am I doing the right thing by focusing all my money to debt repayment at the moment

- What can I do to maximize my tax return, when it comes around in March

- If I plan on purchasing a house next year or the year after (or at any point in my life) (either as residence or investment), What can I do to make that as efficient as possible (I have heard about maximizing my retirement deductions and then using that money to put towards a down payment, I am unclear about this process and would like to know more)
- Are there any creative ways to maximize the money I keep in my pocket from my income (set up a corporation, etc.) I do not have any knowledge about this and I have only heard/seen stuff on the media

- Are there any ways of setting up supplemental income once my debts are paid off (or even before if the returns are higher than my interest rates (doubt it)). Examples would be a savings account or investment in another vessel that would get me solid and safe returns

personalfinance,Are FHA Mortgages still a reasonably viable option?,"FHA loans have seen a lot of changes recently, most specifically not being able to ever remove the PMI once you hit 20% equity, and having to refinance.  

My wife and I (both 28) are looking to buy our first house. We make a combined salary of 150k. We have 8-10k put away for a down payment (wife was 1099 half the year, have to see how taxes pan out in January, we have more than enough saved to cover those). After next month, we will be CC debt free for the first time since before college! We still have about 70k in student loans. We just recently started budgeting out our monthly expenses so we know exactly where our money is going and have our future mapped out thanks to the helpful FAQ in this sub! My credit score is around 800, while hers needed lots of work and we've managed to get her up around 650.  

We are looking at buying around a $250k house. This will be our first house, but we want to be here for at least 10 years. We'll hopefully be trying for our first kid in two years or so, and we'd like to be settled into a house we own first. With an FHA loan and seller's assist, we already have the money to make this work. My wife and I both have very stable jobs, and she stands to get a pay raise of $10-20k in the next couple of years. I'm also considering a job move which would result in a pay bump.  

I'm reading lots of articles on how FHA mortgages are a great option, but most of these were written prior to the PMI change. Our current plan is to get an FHA Mortgage, aggressively pay to 20%, and then refinance with a conventional mortgage to eliminate PMI. But with no real knowledge of how the real estate market works, I'm concerned that with rates being so low, they might shoot up by the time we're ready to refinance? I suppose a higher interest rate is still better than burning money in PMI payments, and you can always refinance again later if rates drop.  

If we were to go for some kind of conventional mortgage with 10% down, even if we aggressively saved something like $3k/month, it would still take us a year or so, really setting back our plans for the future. Our current rent lease is up next June. While it has been a great rental house, it is an old house that needs lots of work and is tight on space. I really don't want to take another year lease and would rather the money we spend on rent be paying into a mortgage since we will definitely be buying a house, and quite frankly, we're sick of living there. We also want to move closer to my wife's work to lessen the burden of her commute, since she has a great job and foresees herself being there for many years.  

This is easily the biggest decision I've ever had to make in my life. We will easily be able to afford the monthly payments, even with PMI and seller's assist to reduce the money due at closing. Am I just being paranoid and over thinking the situation? Obviously the ""perfect"" situation is we pay off all of our student loans first and then save up 20% and buy a house with a conventional mortgage, but that will take years! We're almost 30 and want to move into the next phase of our life. Thanks for reading.",finance,1415646251

I bought a town home last June.  It cost me $324,000 which after a down payment and seller coverage really cost about $309k.  I've been living in one of the bedrooms while renting out the other rooms to some friends (we split utilities).  My mortgage payments are $1853.67 / month and I have an association of $300 / month.  I get $2200 in rent from my roommates each month.  I pay $850 to myself in rent and my portion of the utilities averages out to around $80 / month.  I've paid down my principle a little but I still owe $292,441.34.  It's a 4.125% interest rate.  The property tax is about $4100/year and the insurance is $225 / year.  According to Zillow's estimate my home is currently worth $511,875.  That can't be right, it's usually in the lower $400k range.
That's about to change.  I'm pretty sure a couple roommates are going to move out within 2 or 3 months which will basically force everyone (including myself) to move out so I can rent it out.  2 of the other 3 town homes in my association are renting for $2750 / mo.  I'll probably have to move into an apartment near work for around $1000/mo including utilities.

**Salary***
My current salary is $83,000 but It's going to be lowered to $77,000 January 1st (long story short - I get $500/mo for insurance but I'm on my moms insurance still, that $500 is going away).  I also have a Roth 401k with this company.  The employer match is 4% if you pay 5%.  I believe I put in 7% which I'm pretty sure is setup as aggressive growth.  My Roth 401k is currently at $2,100.91  There's a potential for a 10% bonus but I don't include that because it isn't guaranteed.

**Student Loans**
I consolidated my loans right out of college so now I have 2 loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) at $12,936.50 and $6,018.28.  They're each 5% interest rate.

**Saved Money**
Bank 1 - Used for my home / rental property.  I have a money market account setup as a 6 month safety net for my mortgage / association.  I have $15,173.06 in that account (just over 6 months now).  The interest rate on the money market account is something like 0.2%
Bank 2 - Savings / Checking.  I have $17,088.10 in my savings and $12,282.76 in my checking.  The interest rate in my savings is something really, maybe 0.1%  I just pull from either account because I don't have either setup as a safety net quite yet, although I have 6 months covered easily.

**Expenses**
For the time being I have a lot of stuff paid for by my mom (I know, I know).  That'll soon change but it is what it is right now.  She pays my car insurance, health insurance, and phone bill.
According to Mint I spend ~ $40/mo on gas, $17/mo on the gym, $130/mo misc shopping, $350/mo all food.
I usually will pay $1000/mo or so on student loans or something and have a net of $2500/mo somehow.


**List of stuff broken down**

* House Original cost - $324,000 ($309,000 real cost after down payment / seller coverage, etc)
* Current Mortgage - $292,441.34 @ 4.125% interest rate
* Association - $300 / mo
* Salary - $83,000 current - $77,000 starting January
* 401k - $2,100.91.  I put in 7% (aggressive growth?) and the company matches 4%.
* Student Loans - $18954.78 @ 5%
* Net Income after all spending ~ $2500 ($3800 if you don't include paying down loans early).
* Money in rental property account - $15,173.06
* Money in savings / checking - $29,370.86

**My questions**
1.  I know my student loans have a higher interest rate than my home, however, it's my understanding that banks charge a ton of interest first rather than normal interest + a lot of principal.  Would it be smarter to pay my mortgage principal down now to have smaller initial interest payments?  Would you do that, pay the student loans off first, or do other investments (Roth IRA, get some stocks, etc)?

2.  I probably have to move out soon, does anyone have any experience with the professional landlords that rent your house for you?  I don't have a lot of time to commit to that sort of stuff.  Also, if anyone has any advice about what to look for / watch out for when renting a 1BR apartment I'm all ears.

3.  Knowing all of my expenses / income, is there anything that you would do if you were in my situation?  (I'm good with computers, not so much in financing)  I'm probably overlooking something.

Sorry for being so longwinded / unorganized.  However, I'd appreciate it very much if you had any advice for me. Thank you!",finance,1415648284
investing,PLAY - Does anyone find their filings a little odd?,"I like Dave and Buster's. They are growing pretty rapidly and for the most part have a huge potential for new markets both in the U.S. and internationally as markets begin to compete and leisure becomes a part of life. 

I have been to D&amp;B a few times in a few different cities, and I personally know their Hawaii GM and Concept Leader, and from what I'm hearing their recent repositioning for overall entertainment(not just arcade games) seems very promising. I am interested in taking a very long position.

Here is the thing. I am going through all of their reports for the last three years, as well as some non-GAAP numbers for the prior 6 years. One thing I'm noticing is that their assets and liabilities almost always match, as in they have a debt ratio of 100% on the dot. They don't plan on dividends for the foreseeable future, and I'm left wondering if, as interest rates rise, will their cost of capital take a possibly disproportionately bigger chunk out of returns as they have to pay more for their debts? On top of that, do you think the 100% debt ratio (to the nearest thousand dollars) is a sign of poor or questionable accounting? You can find their reports here: http://ir.daveandbusters.com/results.cfm

And you can find their non-GAAP measures for '06 to '12 here: http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-16L7N9/3619796536x0x670081/6E74B3D2-07A4-436B-B1ED-D0791BB59097/Non-GAAP_Calculations.M4.pdf

I think the stock is too new to care about sentiment or technical analysis, so I'm leaning 100% on the fundamentals.

personalfinance,"27 y/o student, very limited credit history, need to buy a car. Best option?","Hello PF! Been lurking for a while and now I actually need some advice for myself. Here's a (somewhat) brief overview of my situation:

* I was (wrongly) told by my parents for the longest time that credit cards are the devil and I should avoid them as long as possible. So, until I was 26, I had absolutely no credit history. Through advice gleaned from my SO and you fine folks here, in January I opened a secured card for $300, and then in August I qualified for my very first unsecured card. Hooray for me!
* I've also opened a couple ""store cards"" in the last few months, which I've been using for small purchases and paying off immediately. I also understand this is good for my credit, even though their limits are low. 
* I am also a student and I have been taking out federal student loans. Last year, which was my first taking out loans, this caused a gigantic dip in my credit score right after they were originated (I was monitoring it through Mint for a while but stopped because it was expensive) but it bounced back after about a month. I believe that might have just happened again, because...
* I applied for a car loan through my bank so that I could buy a car to get myself around. I asked for a somewhat large amount ($17.5k) and was denied partially due to my low credit score (student loans?), but mostly due to my lack of credit history.
* I asked my parents to co-sign on the car loan, but they are unable to due to my older brother's student loans that they co-signed on (and he never paid, because he's an entitled jerk, so they are stuck paying instead) and also because my dad is close to retirement and my car loan wouldn't end until after he's retired.

So, now I'm looking at financing through the dealership itself. I'm looking at buying a used car that's relatively new, so that it will last me a while and also pass the requirements for being a Lyft driver (which would hopefully translate into quitting my current retail job, giving me more flexible hours and more time to study). The loan I previously applied for was somewhat big because I was aiming for a used Prius, but since then I've narrowed it down to a few others that are between $10-12k. 

My questions:

1) Does the size of the loan determine whether I qualify when it's due to lack of credit history? I'm not sure whether to ask my bank again if they'd go for a smaller amount. 

2) What range of interest rates am I looking at going through a dealership with limited credit history? 

3) Would this kind of financing through a dealership negatively affect my credit score, similar to ""payday loans"", or does it matter where I finance it from?

personalfinance,"How paying cash for a new car can cost you $20,000 or more!","Just an article I wrote for my own use to show customers when talking finance. Wondering what PF thinks of this (BTW I suspect you guys will tear this article apart)

The finance advantage!

So you are very good with your money! You have been working hard and budgeting properly for many years. You have also managed to save up an emergency fund of $45,000 plus create an investment portfolio of $250,000! Congratulations, you are way ahead of everyone else. Now your last kid just got out of college and you and your wife have decided that you no longer want to be driving used cars and its now time to purchase a BRAND NEW CAR. Sure its not a wise investment, but you've never had a new car and its time to treat yourself. Good for you, you deserve it! You guys decide on a budget and say you want to spend a pretty penny get all the bells and whistles, but not go overboard and decide to spend $45,000 to include tax and title on a mid size luxury SUV. So how are you going pay for it? Well you have $250,000 in the bank with a monthly income of $12,000 you should just go ahead and pay cash and avoid finance charges right? 

NO! Thats the worst thing you can do! 

Sure if you pay cash you won't pay any interest...however there are two very good reasons why paying cash is a bad idea.

* Reason 1: Finance rebates! Banks often incentive customers to finance by offering rebates for finance. Sometimes those finance rebates can be as high as $2,000! (this is quite rare) I however often times see them around $1,000. To get this finance rebate you must finance with a particular bank. Let me ask you this...would you rather get a $1,000 discount and finance or pay cash and pay $1,000 more?

* Reason 2: Let your money work for you! Interest rates are at an all time low. I bet you money that if you have $250,000 invests you are making more then 6%. So lets do the math on your $45,000 car.

You have a choice finance or paying cash. If you finance you will get a 60 month loan at 2% for $44,000 which puts your payments at $771 a month. Which means IF you let the loan ride out its entire time you will pay $46,200 vs the $45,000 had you paid cash. But now wait, how is paying $1,200 more a good deal? 

Now of course if you took the finance offer you left $45,000 in your investment right? And its earning 6% which means in 5 years time that $45,000 would actually be worth $60,400. We could even factor in taxes at 30% which would put your $45,000 at $55,780 meaning you still came out ahead by nearly $10,000! So paying cash would have actually cost you $10,000 MORE for the SAME car.

What if there is no finance rebate? Well its still worth it! If there was no finance rebate and you financed a $45,000 car at 2% for 60 months your payments would be $788 putting your final cost at $47,280 meaning even if you financed, after you've paid upwards of 30% tax you would still come out ahead by $8,500!

So just for the curious, lets see how much farther you'd come out ahead if you made more money on your investments. (assuming there is a $1,000 finance rebate with 30% capital gains tax)

* 6% gives you a net benefit of $9,580
* 7% gives you a net benefit of $11,687
* 8% gives you a net benefit of $13,901
* 9% gives you a net benefit of $16,251 (you can buy a new car with this)
* 10% gives you a net benefit of $18,688 (you can buy a nicer new car with this)
* 11% gives you a net benefit of $21,224 (you can buy an even newer car with this)",finance,1415661926

I am starting a full-time job soon and will be able to make the monthly minimum payments on all of these loans, but likely not much more.

As an alternate way to handle this debt, a family member has suggested the idea of letting me use their home equity line of credit to pay off some or all of my student loan debt. They are not wealthy, but financially stable so that this is not a huge risk for them. I would then be responsible for paying down the credit line, which has a current rate of 2.9% but would change over time based on the prime rate. I do not know yet know the monthly minimum payment amount or amortization schedule to compare to the student loans, but this would effectively remove the debt from my credit score and get me a better interest rate. I believe more of the interest would be tax deductible, but the line of credit is in my family member's name and we discussed the possibility of him keeping the return from the deduction.

So I posted [this](http://theoatmeal.com/blog/net_neutrality) link to Facebook today, with the following text:

A serious issue that was just given a catchphrase with no real argument? THAT'S politics.

And no, Net Neutrality is nothing like Obamacare--especially since the idea is that it NOT be controlled. By anyone.

My brother posted this:

On Monday Obama announced that ""the Internet"" should be regulated like any other utility. Yeah, seeing as how the government regulating and subsidizing all other utilities has historically worked out so well...
There is currently NO REGULATION of the Internet, Net Neutrality will exert control over it and institute government influence. You can argue that government regulation of the Internet is what you want, but don't say that Net Neutrality is about the Internet NOT being controlled. It IS Obamacare for the Internet. Get ready for cell phone like ""Bandwidth Plans"" if this law passes...
_____________

My response:

From Wikipedia: Net neutrality s the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication. Proponents often see net neutrality as an important component of an open Internet, where policies such as equal treatment of data and open web standards allow those on the Internet to easily communicate and conduct business without interference from a third party.

The issue is that opponents are trying to say that Net Neutrality is the exact opposite of that. And since many people listen to politicians and not the experts, there ends up more confusion than information.

Obama, in an unexpected move, has NOT asked for regulating the internet, but to reclassify the internet as a Title II classification, which is what phones are classified under right now. That way, phone companies don't gouge prices if you're calling a friend with a different carrier. If Comcast has its way, they could charge extra to use sites like YouTube, Netflix, and even Facebook. If you want those services, you can pay for internet ""fastlanes"" at a ""nominal"" fee.

There is currently no regulation of the internet. But Comcast has already made moves to charge extra for services. Netflix is already paying Comcast money to defer the cost from their customers, and hoping that this will be ruled illegal. (With a link to Net Neutrality on Wikipedia)
_____________

His response:

So you are agreeing with me that you are FOR government regulation of the Internet, of which there is currently none (as stated in this article). Also, it compares the type of regulation to telephone companies. Let me remind you that before the break up of AT&amp;T in '86, there was no need to have a maintenance contract for your phone lines. If something broke it was AT&amp;T's responsibility to fix it no matter where the trouble was-without an additional charge to the customer. After divestiture, the government established ""tariffed"" and ""non-tariffed"" areas of the telephone circuit. If the customers did not pay an additional charge each month for a maintenance plan then they could be charged up to a $110 one-time fee for a repair to the ""non-tariffed"" or customer's side of the Demarcation Point. Customers who had lived their entire lives accustomed to ""Ma Bell"" just fixing the trouble free of charge were understandably outraged by this new fine. But it was an unforeseen consequence of the government regulation that the majority of consumers wanted.
I use that example to illustrate that this Net Neutrality will do everything BUT leave the Internet ""free from control"". Again I say, get ready for cell-phone-like data plans for your home broadband connection...how many gigs a month are you gonna need Nick?

My question is, how is it that the opposition has made it that Net Neutrality is the over-regulation of internet?  Or is there a hint of truth to that?  Am I missing some important advice?",technology,1415687860
personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans in a big lump sum?,"I have roughly $13k in Federal Stafford loans at 6.8% interest. I've been employed as an independent contractor in a fairly stable setting for 11 months (I can plan on at least another 2 years in this job).

Is it wise to just pay off this $13k in a big lump sum immediately? I feel like I can afford it, I am just not sure if its a great plan to just sign away such a large percentage of my assets to clear the student loan debt, particularly at the expense of a retirement contribution (I'm 26).

I have been putting 3000 every month...;however, I'm getting frustrated. I end up at around 169,000 but by end of the month I'm back up to 171,000. I put in another 3k, and then back at 168,000 and then end of the month I'm back to 170,000.

I'm not at the best at numbers but help me understand this:


Every dollar i put in just goes into interest and not principal...so technically im getting the same accrued interest every month (UNTIL I CHIP AWAY AT PRINCIPAL). Not only that, but I'm also getting compounded interest which is making my life miserable.

I do have 10,000 in savings, and I'm debating on putting 8k in right now- have all interest paid off, and just chip away at my principal amounts with 2-3k monthly payments after.

If my thinking is correct- I'll lower ""interest rate"" because I'm chipping away at PRINCIPAL. Until i payoff my accrued interest...the SAME amount of interest is accumulating every month due to no changes in the principal...am i right?

Realistically speaking- will I be saving alot of money? 10,000? 5000? 1000? in the long run...  If its just something like 1000...then maybe I'll wait it out...

Where do I go from here?","I have roughly $116,000 in student loan debt spread across I believe 9 accounts. Interest rates range from 3-9%. The minimum monthly payment is $1758 when you add up all the minimums.

I take home $4664 per month (gross $92,000/yr).

I graduated college in 2009.

My budget right now looks as follows:

* Rent $515
* Internet $70
* Gas + Electric $100
* Water $50
* Car Payment $138 
* Gas $290 (see commute details, below)
* Food $300 (I need to cut this down, but on days I commute, cooking is just not something I have time for. I commute 4 hours a day, 3 days a week)
* Loan Minimums $1758
* Savings $200

------
Total outflow $3421

I've been trying to throw $1000 a month extra at the debt but it doesn't seem to really be helping that much. Which should still leave me $200 for ""unexpected"" but it always seems like there is something that sucks that money up--like this month I need to contribute food to two thanksgiving dinners, and I needed a pair of work pants because I ripped the pair I have. I'm a girl, if that matters.

I guess when $116,000 becomes $115,000 that doesn't seem like very much. I feel like for making so much money, I never have any money. I have about $3k in savings as an emergency fund, but that's it.

I don't know how else to tackle this. I know some of you will see the gas cost and tell me to move closer, but the difference in rent between where I live and where my office is would far, far exceed both the cost of the car and the gas. A mediocre 1br near my office would run me an easy $1500+utilities, so right now it is cheaper to drive. So I drive 180 miles round trip, 3 days a week, to go to work. Other days I work from home.

Do I just keep throwing a thousand bucks at it and wear thrift store clothes while working a near 6-figure job until eventually something happens? The whole situation seems pretty hopeless. Everyone seems to think I should be able to pay on the debt and still have a ton of money left over (my parents, for example, are extremely disappointed in my savings rate and seem to think I can just put $2k a month away) but I don't see how that's possible.",finance,1415717943
personalfinance,Recent college graduate looking for financial guidance,"Hey all,

Looking for some financial guidance as I begin my working career.  Here's some numbers:

Just graduated from college in May and started a $63,000 job over the summer.  My company does a 4% match for my ROTH 401(K), so I am contributing at that level.

After deducting that, federal tax, social security, medicare, and state tax and I'm at an income of around $44,000 annually.

My rent is $1,100 a month, utilities are around $200 (they've been lower, but I think they may go up during the winter time).

I spend about $75 every two weeks on gas, and we'll say $100 a week on food (been eating out a lot which I've been trying to change, and I usually am not home during the weekends, so this is more a guestimate than a hard number...probably end up spending a bit more).

After these expenses, I'm at around $21,000 annually.  I also think in the next few months I'm going to have to start paying for dental and vision insurance, I'm not exactly sure on the details of that yet but I will know soon.  So here's where it gets a little tricky...

I have nine student loans with varying interest rates going into repayment this month with a current balance of $33,000.  With all this considered, I'm trying to find what's best to do with my extra income.  

1) How much is a good amount of money to keep in my savings?  I currently have about $3,000 in my savings account.  I know people talk about having an emergency fund which I'm all for, but I know the money isn't doing anything when just sitting there, so I'm trying to find a sweet spot.

2) I believe I can do a ten year repayment plan on the loans for a bit over $350 a month.  I guess this would be my minimum payment, but that also means I'd be paying a good amount of interest, which I'd like to avoid.

3) Should I consider investing my money?  Perhaps put more in the 401(K)?  Is this a better option than having a higher loan payment?  I have a knowledgable friend who is interested in setting up a hedge fund, which I am considering, but I don't really have any details on that now.  If I decide to get involved with that I would probably start with an initial $500-$1,000 and see how that goes for a bit until I get raise or something.

4) I would like to attend graduate school at some point (maybe 2-3 years down the road), so I'm keeping that in the back of my mind.  If I did this, I would most likely go for my PhD, and would hopefully not have to incure more loans to do this.

5) With the holiday season coming up I'd like to have some spending money available for gifts and maybe a weekend vacation...

personalfinance,Please Share your thoughts on my current financial situation,"Hello PF. Whether you realize it or not, some of you have been very helpful in directing people like me towards a better future financially. I would like to share my current situation, and my budget and would like to get your thoughts on whether my expectations are reasonable.

**Background:** I have accumulated a fair amount of debt from going to an East coast private university for graduate school. After completing the degree, I realized I hated the field that I had decided to pursue educationally, and ended up in an entirely different field that I quite enjoy, but had to start at the bottom (hope to change that soon). The student loan debt was somewhere in the $59,000+ range, but I've managed to reduce it to $35,000+ over the last 2 1/2 years. I also got married 4 months ago. I personally didn't feel like I was financially ready to get married, but I love my wife, and I knew her parents were worrying about her getting older (we're Asian, that matters a lot to Asians) so we decided to get married and that happened 4 months ago. At the moment, due to... immigration issues and stuff, my wife is unable to work so it's only my income. We have attempted to tackle my student loan debt hard (or as hard as we currently can) and I thought I would see what PF has to say about it.

**Monthly Budget:**

- Take Home Pay: $3000

- Tithe: $300.

- Rent: $683.

- Groceries: $150. My wife seems fairly confident that she can make it work with this amount, and it's been fairly healthy food so far (e.g. we had moussaka yesterday)

- Internet: $40.

- Cell phones (for two): $63(ish) for approximately 2 gb (each), and unlimited talk/text. 

- Water / Trash / Sewage: $40(ish).

- Electricity: $50(ish). This one varies quite a bit. Our high was $90. The last couple months, we got it down to $48.

- Car payment: $285.

- Car insurance: Lump sum amount given to parents who I am still covered under, because it was a better deal than getting insurance by myself.

- Gas/Fuel: $70.

- Entertainment: $20. A lot of free, low-cost date nights at the moment. Or Netflix movie nights.

- Credit Card: $100. (Approximately $2500 in credit card debt; all wedding expense related. This is the first time I've not paid off a credit card balance entirely. The plus side is it's 0% APR at the moment).

- Federal Loan Servicing: $685 minimum payment for 8 student loans (interest varies from 6.8% to 8.5%). Balance: $34,984(ish).

- Sallie Mae / Navient: $50 minimum payment (interest is 2.33%). Balance: $644(ish).

- Miscellaneous Expenses: $50. For when we realize we need something that we don't have budgeted elsewhere (i.e. medicine).

403B contribution, health insurance, etc. is already taken out through my employer prior to my take home pay, and it's a reasonable price (something like $50 a month for our health ins.). We have $2000 put aside as an emergency fund.

The remaining $400 or so that we have left over each month is being thrown at the 8.5% Fed loan.

**Main Question(s):**
What am I forgetting? Is there anything I'm not accounting for? Is there anything I should do differently?

Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Should I do income based student loan repayment? I may qualify for public service loan forgiveness.,"Hello all. New to PersonalFinance. I was looking for some advice on if I should do Income Based Loan Repayment on my federal student loans. Currently I have been paying for 2 years and have $26,000 left. My monthly payments are $331.00. I don't struggle to make my monthly payments by any means. However, I did the IBR calculation on the student loan website and found that I would probably be paying around $150 for the next couple years.

I am currently saving for a wedding that me and my s.o. are paying for cash (as opposed to credit) and after that we will be looking to save for a house. An extra $120 a month would certainly help. Yet over the course of the loan with IBR I would be paying an additional $9000 in interest. Current payment plan has me paying $36k after everything is said and done and with IBR it would be $45k. HOWEVER, I have been working for a non-profit for two years and may continue to work in the non-profit or government sector for another 8, which would mean I would qualify for the public service loan forgiveness and anything left over in 8 years would ""go away"".

personalfinance,Rent vs. Buy: How does renting and buying affect wealth?,"This [infographic by HelloWallet](http://www.hellowallet.com/research/house-of-cards) shows how renting or buying affects wealth creation. It also mentions how online Rent vs. Buy calculators are misleading and falsely inflate the benefits of home ownership.

The whitepaper which dives into more detail can be found here: http://www.hellowallet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HelloWallet-House-of-Cards.pdf

The paper includes two analyses. The first examines historical home purchase data from the Federal Reserve Board’s 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances. Szapiro compares how much wealth Americans would have created had they rented a comparable home and invested any savings in a portfolio of stocks and bonds over the home ownership period. The second analysis looks at two hypothetical households—one earning $50,000 per year and the other $100,000—living in 20 major cities to examine the effect of state and local tax structures on the buy versus rent decision. HelloWallet’s research finds:

* A median-income U.S. household ($50,000 in annual income) could generate more than 50 percent more net wealth over the next 10 years by renting and investing instead of buying a home.
* Median income homeowners realize no federal tax benefit in 75 percent of major cities.
* More than half of current homeowners, or more than 40 million households, purchased their homes during time periods when average homebuyers would have been better off renting and investing.
* Many popular, free, online “buy-or-rent” calculators inflate the benefits of home buying. The study shows that calculators provide inaccurate guidance to more than 90 percent of renters considering whether to buy a home by overestimating tax benefits and underestimating the returns an individual can earn by investing.
* Prospective home buyers should calculate their “rent-to-price” ratio, or the ratio of the annual rental costs of a home compared with its purchase price, to determine whether to by a home or rent and invest. If the rent-to-price ratio is 5% or less, people may be better off renting and investing any savings. If the rent-to-price ratio is greater than that, they may be better off buying a house.",finance,1415726362

personalfinance,Question regarding student loans,"I am currently paying off $27,000 in Direct Loans. $20,000 is from a consolidated *subsidized* loan, while the other $7,000 is from a consolidated *unsubsidized* loan. They are both at a fixed interest rate of 6.375%, for minimum monthly payments of $160 for the subsidized loan and $60 for the unsubsidized loan.

My question is, if I start to pay off more than the minimum every month (say a total of $600 per month) is there any reason that it would be more beneficial to put the entire extra ~$380 towards one or the other of the two loan repayment first?

My tentative understanding is that there is no difference which I pay first as the distinction between subsidized and unsubsidized becomes obsolete once out of deferment status. Is this correct?

personalfinance,How can I avoid (or at least limit) federal estate taxes legally?,"I will be inheriting a sum of money in the near future due to a family member who is suffering from declining health. The state I live in has no death/estate taxes so I am only interested in learning about the federal estate tax and ways around it that are legal. It is my understanding that right now the first 5.34 million of an estate are exempt from taxes and next year that will be raised to 5.45 million. However, after the exemption every dollar is taxed at a sickening 40%. 

My question is how can I legally avoid as much of this tax as possible. I know that gifting can be done at 14k per person per year which is awesome but is no where near the scale that I am looking for.

They are all subsidized Federal Stafford Loans with 5.6% to 6.8% fixed interest rates. 

My question is should I pay off the loans as much as I can now, since the loans are in deferment and the interests are not accumulating? I can live comfortable with my stipend even contributing to the loan repayment. 

Are there any other benefits of repaying the student loans now while they are in deferment (besides of the non-accumulating interest rates)? What about penalties? Are there any penalties that I should be aware of if I repay my student loans right now? (I can't not find any information of any existing penalties, but please let me know).

personalfinance,Graduated College and have a new job: Saving and Paying Loans (questions inside),"Hi everyone,

I've followed for a while and have read a lot on this sub, but was looking for some advice specific to my situation. I'll lay out what my circumstances are and what I think I want some longer-term goals to be, but this is an area that is open for discussion. I think having the situation be my own has might have made me overlook certain areas that would be obvious to someone looking in.

My situation:

* Graduated with my B.S. in may
* Started a new job last week (full time) in Northeastern Massachusetts, near the NH border.
* I am paid $69,000 annually. There is a 401k match up to 8% of income, and MA has a 5% state income tax. This means I will gross about $46,000 into my bank account. 
* I currently live with my parents in NH where I grow up and basically do not pay rent, but do just buy what the house needs when needed (e.g. concessional shopping trip). The commute though is long--over 60 miles to work, and takes about an hour and a half on the interstate to get home.
* I currently have ~$2,000 in savings.
* I have about $21,000 in student loans. Interest rates vary between about 3.5% and 6%.
* I owe $10,000 on a car loan that has a 0% interest rate. It's a year old now and has had no problems. Only foreseeable expense would be snow tires.
* No credit card debt or any major purchases I am expecting to need in the next six months or so.

I'm really excited about my new job and feel like I am in a very good spot. But I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can. So that's where I have some questions:

* What's a good dollar value to put on my emergency fund? I plan to build to this level before starting aggressive loan payments
* How aggressively should I pay my student loans down? My inclination would be to pay these down as fast as possible, if mostly for the psychological desire to be debt free.
* I am planning on moving out into my own apartment. Unfortunately housing is still pretty expensive near where I want to work, at least without roommates, and I don't know anyone in the area to live with. What would be a good rent budget?
* After my loans, I have a goal of starting to save for a home purchase. Is this a reasonable next step goal? Should I focus on loans first and then this kind of major savings, or work on them simultaneously?
* What are the thoughts of continuing the long commute to save money vs. getting an apartment close to work. I will admit the commute is a large quality of life factor for me.

I've been actively using Mint for about of a year and it's been a great tool. Is there anything obvious or important I am overlooking in my planning?

Thanks for the help and advice everyone.",finance,1415738303
personalfinance,Should I sell my car to pay for college?,"I am kind of a strange predicament and am just looking for advice on what the best move is for my current situation and the future. I currently own a car that is paid off and worth 10k, but is starting to have mechanical issues and might need major work done soon. I have been given the opportunity to use my brothers car while he is deployed. All I would have to pay for is insurance and maintenance. His car is almost brand new and gets twice the gas mileage as my car and would save me over $150 on gas a month. The reason I am even considering this, is because I am currently about to attend my last three semesters in college and the cash in hand from selling my car and the money I save, would come close to paying for those semesters. So is it better to come out of college with 20k in college loans or 20k car loan debt? I can get a lower interest rate on the car loan then the school loan I have been offered from the government. I should add that I will be making 60k a year out of college and already have the job 90% locked up.",finance,1415741778
technology,Help me figure out what I think about Net Neutrality? [x-post],"I've been trying to wrap my mind around the whole Net Neutrality issue (specifically, in the US). **I want to see all of the arguments from every angle so that my opinion on the topic is thought-out and well-informed.** Help me do that?

There are plenty of discussions on Reddit and elsewhere that can go in every direction. Of course most sources online are also going to be skewed in a pro Net Neutrality position as well. So I'd like to provide some direction. Below is a list of questions that I've boiled my thoughts down to. If you respond directly to this post, **please at least address some of them before contributing anything else**. This isn't necessarily just about Net Neutrality in and of itself. I think part of the conversation has to address the political ideologies that we follow to our conclusions.

I'll do my best to leave out my own opinions (which are ultimately weak and undecided anyways). **Please provide a source** for your answers *if possible*. You don't have to, but I can only take comments without support as a grain of salt. That said, I don't mean to discourage sharing your own opinions! I value those as well as facts. 

*1) How would you describe or quantify the government's investment to date in the Internet's infrastructure? (at every level: federal, state, local)*

*2) How have these resources been managed so far? Why?*

*3) Is there any practical, legal standing to the notion that the government can reclaim the infrastructure from ISPs? (For example, could the government at some level take an ISP to court for mismanaging investments and win, corruption aside?)*

*4) To what extent have ISPs been granted special or exclusive rights in certain locales or regions? How exactly did they obtain this power?*

*5) When, if ever, should government regulated monopolies be permitted? What is your qualification for when the government should step in versus when it should stay away?*

*6) Is it practically possible for Internet access to be provided by competitive companies in a free market environment? Or are regulated monopolies (at some level) necessary?*

*7) How exactly could either of those options (free market or government regulation) create and protect an open Internet? How exactly could either of those options backfire? How would you compare the feasibility and the effectiveness of these options?*

*8) Are there other options?*

*9) Why should/shouldn't Internet access be classified as a utility? How does this affect the debate?*

*10) Exactly what level of control would the ""common carrier"" proposal grant the FCC? How could that power be abused? Why should/shouldn't we expect the FCC to protect an open Internet any more than ISPs?*

personalfinance,"Need some financial advice. In the process of approving a debt consolidation loan, and I'm considering my options for paying off a few different debts. Details in text.","Long story short, if this loan is approved, I'm planning to pay off at least two or three outstanding accounts (credit cards, LASIK financing, car financing, online credit accounts, etc). I'm weighing the interest rate of the loan against current interest rates of my accounts as well as monthly expenses for each account vs. how much the monthly payment for the loan will be.  

That said, I'm faced with a few options, and I wanted some advice.  
* The loan's interest rate is 19.99%, and I'm looking at the following options:  
* Pay off credit card that's been open and near or at its limit for over 5-6 years ($3200 @ 14.65%; I know it's affecting my credit) as well as my LASIK financing completely ($3900; two separate expenses at 30.98% &amp; 26.99%).  
* Pay off LASIK financing and car financing completely ($4050 @ only 14.7% interest rate). This option opens up the possibility of selling my car for something more reliable and less expensive, but it still leaves the credit card completely unpaid.  
* Pay off small part of LASIK ($450 @ 30.99%) the car financing completely, and the credit card completely.  
* Pay off the majority of my LASIK ($3440 @ 26.99%), the credit card that's been open forever ($3100 @ 14.65%) and another credit card ($1800 @ 16.24%).  

These are the only combinations of my expenses that balance out in my mind when it comes to interest and monthly payments, and each has its benefits I suppose. The point is, I'll be paying down debt, closing accounts, and staying at the same monthly payments each month, so that's good.

personalfinance,Question about paying off a car loan to contribute more to 401k,"I’m 29 years of age, and I’ve got an emergency fund of about 5 months saved up ($8000) – through much budgeting for the past year.  Trying to figure out what to do with some of the money as I feel it’s not doing anything for me just sitting in my checking account (although I know it’s good to have it liquid for the emergency).    
    
I’ve got 16 months left of minimum payments, totaling about $3,000 on my car payment at 5% APR.  I’m wanting to be able to contribute to my 401k to get the full match from my employer, which is 50% up to 10% of your income.  The issue is if I contributed 10% every month, I’d be left without much wiggle room at all when I match up income versus expenses.    
    
I’m asking if it’s a bad idea for any reason to just go ahead and pay off the car loan now.  This would only take about a third of my emergency fund away, and it would free up $200 a month that I can contribute to my 401k.  My only other debts are student loans totaling about $8000 at varying interest rates, with 3 years of minimum payments left.    
    Or do I just continue paying the car loan, still contribute the max matched amount to my 401k, and just supplement my income with my savings?
Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!",finance,1415745814

Between my husband (30/M) and I (26/F), we take home about $7240 per month (gross - Him: $75000 paid twice a month, Me: 64000 paid biweekly) not including bonuses.  My bonus is typically around $7000, his TBD, started new job in September, commissions expected to be ~$2000 per month, but not currently included in budget.

FYI, we live in the SF bay area, so our expenses are much higher than many that I have seen.

Our loans, currently:

* My Personal Loan: $3821 remaining @ 12.49% (originally $11000, opened 7/2013)
* Husband’s Unsubsidized Federal Student Loan: $9830 remaining @ 6.8% (originally $10500, repayment began 11/2007)
* Husband’s Subsidized Federal Student Loan: $4817 remaining @ 2.33% (originally $5125, repayment began 11/2007)
* Car Loan: $27143 remaining @ 0%
* No credit card debt – the personal loan paid off my mistakes while working in retail and we pay statement balances in full every month.

Our budget, currently (rounded to nearest dollar):

* Rent: $1932
* Car: $512 (put less down payment, $2000, since it’s at 0%, used funds originally allocated to down payment towards personal loan, ~$4500)
* Student Loan Minimum, combined: $257
* Personal Loan Minimum: $247
* Cable/Internet: $188 (full package, probably not necessary, but we enjoy TV/movies and I find this to be an ok expense for entertainment)
* Electric: ~$40
* Water/Sewer/Trash (billed by apartment complex): ~$160
* Cell phone: $135
* Car insurance: $105 ($1262 billed annually)
* Gas: ~$175
* Food/Drinks: $1400 (I realize this is astronomical for this sub, but we are foodies and enjoy cooking good food and going to good restaurants. Please save me the “cut your food costs and save $1000/mo!”)
* Cat food/litter/expenses: $100

Depending on other miscellaneous expenses, we put $1500-$1900 into savings each month, trying to build up a sizeable emergency fund and save for a house (no small task here, where fixer-uppers (e.g., tear-downs) routinely exceed $1M).  We currently have $7650 saved, and are steadily adding via paycheck deductions ($1400/mo) and whatever else is left at the next payday to throw in.

My question is, should we continue with our current strategy, use the savings to pay off the personal loan, pay over the minimums and decrease savings by some amount, or some other idea I haven’t thought of?  I'm open to any suggestions!

25 years old

Income: **42k** 

Student Loans: **13k** ($200 minimum payment)

Car Loan: **8k** ($200 minimum payment)

Savings/Emergency/Liquid: **15k**



I live in a pretty expensive area (Los Angeles).



I'm looking at houses in a slightly less desirable area where the houses are a bit cheaper.  I've always dreamed of living in a tiny house where space is used efficiently, but even the smallest houses in an area I would consider living in are **200k-300k**.  Now I have been looking into getting a mortgage for quite some time and since my credit is great, it looks like there are institutions willing to approve me.  



I'm getting several offers for the purchase price of a home at a 4% interest rate with 5% down 30 year fixed.  My current s/o would plan on moving into the house with me, which, when you break down the payments would be similar to what I am used to paying in rent.  I know there are other expenses with owning a house, but even with insurance, property taxes, maintenance, I'd still be putting about the same amount toward living every month.  



Now, I'm conflicted on this...On the one hand I feel like this is WAY too deep of a hole to bury myself in.  I feel I should continue paying off my loans, continue saving for a large down payment, and possibly look for a higher paying job.  At my current employer (3 years) I've been getting a 15% raise every year since I started.



The other part of me is so sick of paying rent.  I hate that the majority of my salary every month goes towards something I'm not getting a return on.  The thought of paying the same amount towards something I would eventually own is extremely enticing and property values in the area I'm browsing should only increase over time.  It's a very centrally located neighborhood with low crime. 

So I'm wondering, has anyone been in a similar situation?  Is it a really bad idea to try and move into a house in my current situation?  I've asked just about every knowledgeable person/home owner I know to give advice on the subject and I keep getting conflicting opinions.  Every buy/rent calculator I've taken online says to buy, but there is a big part of me that thinks that could potentially be a stupid decision.

Hey guys, a little about me before I go into further detail: I'm single so no other income, 20 years old, net 50k/year at my current stable job and have about ~60k in the bank and am wondering whether I should buy my dream car (chevrolet corvette) or put a down payment on a house. I plan on doing one of these in the upcoming year (2015).

About the car: It's a [2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray] (http://images.autotrader.com/scaler/544/408/hn/91ba9c5e3e824c36b8ab77463a9ed9bb.jpg) (hopefully I can find a fairly used one on the used market for a decent price in 2015) I hope to pay it all off in one go so I don't have to pay any interest rates etc. This is a dream car for me, I've always wanted one and I'm figuring I have the rest of my life ahead of me so why bother settling down so soon especially since I have no intentions of getting married anytime soon I know the financial drain that comes with a car like that which brings me here.

About the house: the area the houses are in that I'm looking to buy will cost about 500k, (this is because I plan on buying a duplex and plan to rent the other half of the house for about $1k/month to help pay the mortgage) I've checked with my financial advisor and taking into account how frugal he says I am, and adding the extra income from renting half the house, I can easily take on the mortgage for the house granted my spending habits stay low and that I don't get laid off.

Pros/Cons for the two:
(will update this with other pros/cons you guys post):

Car:
Pros: Get to drive my dream car and live my young dream, the car will be paid off so no need to worry about paying back a loan/interest rates, less stress involved in purchasing a car.
Cons: Financial drain (Gas/Insurance/Maintenance etc.)

House :
Pros: Investment, no need to pay rent and instead put that money towards the house, low interest rate (bank quotes me at a 3% rate).
Cons: Will likely eat up most of my earnings for the years to come, financial commitment, lots of stress involved.

I know that financially speaking the home would be the way to go but personally I just need some convincing that the home is worth it in the long run, so what do you guys think? Am I too young and should instead buy myself a nice toy and worry about the whole home thing later on? Or should I start early in order to get ahead and take on the responsibility of owning a home for the sake of my future?

personalfinance,Refinance vs. Home Equity line of credit,"I've been mulling over refinancing the mortgage on our house to lower the interest rate and get ride of the PMI. I would also like to get some money out, $15K, to do some repairs/upgrades around the house and perhaps payoff some credit card debt. I've been having trouble wrapping my head around whether it's better to refinance (with or without cash out) and/or go with a HELOC.

Here is our situation:

My wife and I would like to try and sell the house within the next 3-5 years. We understand that things don't always work out as planned and can't bank on this actually happening for one reason or another (e.g. market crashes again).

Our current mortgage balance is $285,000 at 4.875%, original loan amount was $309,000 which we got in Feb of 2010. So we have about 25 years left. 

We believe our house should be appraised around $400,000. We've checked recent sales in our area as well as had our realtor send us list of recent sales in our area. They've ranged around $375K - $450K. 

Here are a some estimates we've received from our mortgage broker:

Closing Costs: $3500

* No Cash Out, 30 years at 4.125%
* No Cash Out, 20 years at 4.125%
* No Cash Out, 25 years at 4.00%
* 15K Out, 30 years at 4.25%

Current credit card debt: $2600 @ 6.74%, $4900 @ 7.5%

We're currently pay $120 a month for the PMI payment. I've just started reading up on HELOC and how they work so I'm not too sure if that would be a good option to look into.

personalfinance,Made a pretty mistake and need advice(car loan)...,"My wife and I have always been pretty good at managing our credit, but I think I may have just made a laughably silly mistake that could end up costing us big time.  

Okay, Background: Back in '10, I purchased a new 2010 Civic on a 60-month loan which was financed through Honda Financial (UGH, I know) and set myself up with auto-pay online.  Everything at this point is going swimmingly - great interest rate, not a single issue with payments ever, despite all the horror stories I have heard about dealing with HF.  We've been lucky enough to have been met with some good fortune on the financial side of things in the last year, so I decide about a month-and-a-half ago ""Screw it, I'll just pay this mother off and be done with it"" and get rid of this monthly bill we no longer need.

The first thing I do, as I have been bitten by not doing this in the past with other lenders, is go ahead and cancel the auto-pay with the intent of paying off the remainder as a lump sum (I've had other lenders continue to process automatic payments even after the loan has been paid off, and that was a horrid experience to have to fix).  I do this, but decide to hold off on the lump sum for a bit on a whim.  Guess what happens next, of course - I SPACE IT!!!!  For 40 days of course, meaning now my account is in warning status.  Meanwhile Honda is calling me, and I ignore the calls thinking they are unrelated (not putting 2&amp;2 together obviously).   Now, I realize I messed up and quickly go ahead and pay off the lump sum.  However, at this point it my payment is now 40 days late and it has hit my credit (was around 780....WAS)

Anyways, I'm going to call Honda and explain the situation to them and plead for some forgiveness, as I have read that your credit score can drop by 100. My question is - is there anything else I can do to prevent any damage?  It appears the credit bureaus have been contacted and the damage has been done, but I have heard that sometimes lenders will forgive depending on the situation.  Do any of you gurus have advice on how to proceed?


EDIT: GREAT NEWS!  I pleaded with Honda Financial and they agreed to remove any penalties and to contact the credit bureaus and remove the delinquency.  I almost can't believe how easy that was.  Thank you for all the advice!",finance,1415801766

personalfinance,Advice on paying off student loans while in college,"Hey personal finance, 

I just have a few questions about all things that relate to student loans. I tried r/studentloans, but all I found there was posts about people paying off their loans, rather than info on student loans.

Also, I bet all this can be find through search or some saved threads, but I can't seem to find them.

1) All my loans are at 4.66% (They're a mixture of subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans) After this year I will have around 5700 in unsubsidized loans, and 675 in subsidized loans. I'm currently a sophomore. (Didn't take out loans my freshman year, I had some money saved) When I graduate, using these figures I expect 17100 in ubsubsizied and ~1800 in subsidized. (This is at the very very maximum, I expect the amount of be lower)

From what I understand the unsubsidized loans are accruing interest the entire time I'm here in college, but interest won't accrue on this interest until 6 months after I graduate. Correct? So using some quick calculations (I know loan rates change but just an estimate... I overshot loan amount so I think if I undershoot the loan rate it'll close to balance out)

Therefore, if I pay off school before the interest is capitalized, I can expect to pay (17100+(17100*.0466) + 1800) which is ~20,000.

Am I correct in my statement here?

I'm using a lump sum estimate, as it is very possible my parents will gift me this money as a graduation present. At this moment my parents are not helping me pay for school at all, I'm on scholarships and loans, so they told me they will pay off the loans when I finish, but it isn't 100% set in stone.

Moving on:

2) Currently I have ~4,000 saved in the bank. Actually it's 2,600 right now but the 1,400 will be reimbursed by January.

Should I be using any of this money to be paying off the loans now, while I am still in school?

I don't have anything that I pay for at school regularly, and I eat out once a week with friends, so I am spending ~5 dollars a week.

However, I work as a research assistant making ~85 dollars after taxes for 10 hours of work per week.

So I'm making around 80 dollars a week. This money will be used for school as each new semester starts and books are required etc. etc.

So would it be worthwhile to take a thousand or two out of the bank and pay off some of the loans.

I understand that this would lower the total interest accrued over my time in college, but seeing as total interest only comes out to ~800 dollars after 4 years, I think it would make sense to have slightly more interest accrue in exchange for having a fund for emergencies or trips or going out whatever. (I understand saving money is very important, but I also don't want to be 100% saving every penny I make and never enjoying anything)

Anything else I should know about my student loans?

Thanks!

*For every dollar you contribute up to 4% of your compensation (base salary, commissions and bonuses) [Company] will add 50 cents to your account per year, up to $2,000 per year. 
For example, an employee earning $100,000 who contributes 4% ($4,000), will have 50% of that matched (the $2,000 cap). An employee earning $50,000 who contributes 8% (still $4,000 in total dollars), will receive a $1,000 match since only 4% of the employees’ contribution counts towards the match.*

I used it for some car repairs and hit about $450 on it a couple of months ago. Right around the same time the intro 0% interest rate ended. I couldn't pay it off all at once.

I was just laid off. I have $50,000 in a 401(k). If you were in my situation, would you:

* A. roll over my 401(k) to my Roth IRA, paying 25% federal income tax on it (about $12,500, which I can pay with cash on hand)?

* B. leave it in the current 401(k)?

* C. open a traditional IRA and roll it over there?

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for your time, reasoning, and opinions!

&amp;nbsp;

**Explanation:**

I was just laid off from my job. I have the option of leaving my 401(k) with them, or rolling it over to my own (Roth) IRA. (If I had another job lined up, I could also roll it over to that employer's 401(k)...but I don't have a job lined up yet.)

Two reasons to roll over a 401(k) to one’s own (Roth) IRA are:

1. You can control your fund choices and fees

2. You can more easily rebalance your portfolio when your asset allocation proportions stray too far

In my case, (1) is NOT an issue because, in this 401(k), I have access to index funds and an average ER of about 0.18%, with no other fees. This means **option B could work**.

However, (2) applies to my situation, so B isn't necessarily the best option.

&amp;nbsp;

I currently have:

* $85,000 in a post-tax Vanguard **Roth IRA**

* $50,000 in a pre-tax **401(k)** through employer

* $12,000 **cash** available (plus $8,000 emergency fund, for a total of $20,000 cash on hand)

* (I do NOT currently have a traditional IRA open.)

&amp;nbsp;

**My taxable 2014 income will be:**

**around $38,000**

&amp;nbsp;

To get $38,000, take $69,000 in gross income and subtract the following non-taxable amounts:

* $17,000 withholding into 401(k)

* $2,200 withholding into HSA

* $1,050 withholding for medical, dental, vision

* $6,200 standard deduction

* $3,950 personal exemption

(Note that my interest, dividends, and capital gains from taxable accounts will be under $500 for 2014.)

(Note that I’ve already had enough withholding each paycheck to pay off my income tax bill on $38,000. If I make no changes, I expect a small refund of $300+.)

&amp;nbsp;

2014 federal tax brackets for a single person:

* The first $9,075 of my income will be taxed at 10%.

* Any income between $9,075 and $36,900 will be taxed at 15%. (That bracket is $27,825 wide.)

* Any income between $36,900 and $89,350 will be taxed at 25%. (That bracket is $52,450 wide.)

In my case, that’s:

* $9,075 at 10% income tax

* $27,825 at 15% income tax

* $1,100 at 25% income tax (since my taxable income will be $38,000, or $1,100 more than $36,900)

That means any extra “income” above $38,000 will also be taxed at 25%.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a window of about $51,350 before I have to deal with the 28% tax bracket, so all $50,000 would fit within 25% tax bracket.

**If I choose option A and roll over my entire $50,000 401(k) to my Roth IRA, that would be $50,000 in extra “income,” all taxed at 25%, which would add about $12,500 to my 2014 tax year bill.**

I have the cash on hand to pay off such a tax bill.

&amp;nbsp;

Another concern: **I'd rather not do option C (opening a new traditional IRA)** because I hope, someday, to have a high enough income that I actually NEED to do backdoor Roth IRA contributions. However, having a large, pre-existing IRA effectively precludes one from doing such a backdoor contribution (having the IRA leads to [an annoying and expensive tax problem](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth_IRA#Caution)).

Therefore, I’m less inclined to choose the option of rolling over my 401(k) to an IRA and leaving it there.

Bitcoin,"Seriously disappointed in Coinbase. My story of how Coinbase has lost a long-time customer with a transaction history of hundreds of BTC, due to a botched and unprofessional ""compliance"" survey.","Hopefully my story here will help others make the right decisions on the platforms they use and the service and professionalism they demand from those platforms.

A little history first: I have had a Coinbase account for a couple years now, and have made transactions consistently with them, with no other account on any other exchange or trading platform linked to a fiat account of mine. I verified my personal identification information, banking account information, and credit card information as soon as it was available to do so, and have had zero problems making transactions of at least several thousand USD at once. My experience with Coinbase had been perfect up until recently. 

A week and a half or so ago, I decided to make another, rather large buy, of around $6k at the $340 price point. The transaction went through and went into Pending status immediately, waiting on my bank to process the wire transfer the next Monday. Easy, normal.

Come the weekend, I receive a notification that I've never gotten before: a notification that my transaction was cancelled. No reasons given, no information. I email them back. They tell me they will get back to me. Then I hear nothing from them for several days. I send them a follow up email. Another two days of no response. At this point, I am frustrated and confused. Nothing like this has ever happened to me with Coinbase. Their service has always been flawless. I've done everything right! 

So I made a post on /r/coinbase, hoping to force a response through a public forum. This gave me a response in a mere five minutes in my email inbox (Perhaps the Coinbase reddit guy had to poke the Coinbase support guy?): Apparently, my account was disabled to due a compliance survey sent back in September in my email inbox. September? I flip through my inbox and have an ""Aha"" moment. I remember receiving an email from a Coinbase entity asking me to send them personal information regarding my source of funds and my use of BTC. At the time, while irked that Coinbase was asking for even more personal information after already having enough information to steal my identity, I felt willing to provide them the answers. After all, I had no problems with their service and ""trusted"" them as a company. However, the problem came when I double checked the Coinbase website for more information on this survey. There was nothing. Nothing in the FAQ, nothing on my homepage. I checked my verification settings. All verified with green checkmarks as always. I attempt to initiate a buy order. No mentions or warnings of compliance, or a survey, or my account being disabled. Not a hair out of place. Wow, I thought, I'm not sure what the sender of the email was going to do with the information had I sent it, but it must be some sort of complex spam/phishing attempt. Surely Coinbase would make a bigger deal out of a huge effort of compliance by making sure its customers are fully aware of the survey and would send in the information in order to protect themselves. They'd surely do so by alerting its customers on the platform itself, so that we do not continue to try to use their service without having done all the steps necessary to fully comply with the law ourselves. This isn't a casual email matter. This is a big-yellow-notification-on-the-front-page-and-on-the-order-screen matter. Nope. Indeed, it was just an out-of-the-blue email asking for personal information that looked suspicious and uncharacteristically unprofessional enough that a long-time customer of Coinbase (me) would delete it assuming it was spam/phishing. 

Alright, alright, I think to myself after being told my order was cancelled due to this survey, NOW you tell me that that email was actually sent by you, that it was actually legitimate. I go back and fill out the survey with a couple sentences. (My use of BTC is not a cause for alarm, FYI; it's pretty much only for trading/investing for which I DO pay taxes.) Done. Sure, the survey could have been handled a LOT better by Coinbase, but I'm glad Coinbase is appropriately cancelling orders when its customers have not satisfied the requirements for full-compliance. I request that my transaction, which was held off because I had not filled out the survey, now be completed now that I had completed it. After all, had I had filled out the survey then, there would be no problems with the transaction at all. Nope to this too. They message me back basically saying that it's fantastic that I now filled out the survey, but because I was non-compliant a week ago when I made the transaction, they cannot honor it even though I am compliant now. This part frustrated me the most. What difference does it make that I didn't fulfill all the requirements a week ago? I fulfill them now, don't I? When I pressed the confirmation button on the platform, it was the agreement: X coins for Y dollars. Sure, it was put on hold due to logistics, but because those logistics are cleared now, continue on our original contract! Is Coinbase really trying to force me to re-do the transaction now that the price point has risen since a week ago?

So here I am, after years of loyalty to Coinbase and after experiencing the frustration of a completely ambiguous and haphazard ""compliance survey"" methodology that did not seem to value the customer's comfort or confidence, being gouged an extra bit of money that's dwarfed by the amount of fees I've paid to Coinbase under the guise of non-compliance. They want me to redo the order at the new price point? Forget it, I'll do so on another platform. 

**tldr; Long-time user of Coinbase, receive a shady email with a compliance survey asking for personal information, see no mention of it on their website so I ignore it as spam/phishing, get my big transaction cancelled because it was actually Coinbase who sent it, they then refuse to honor my original transaction due to ""non-compliance,"" although it seems like they want to make a profit off of my dealing with their botched survey.**",cryptocurrency,1415836530
personalfinance,Shameful financial situation. What to do?,"I'm 35 years old, and in the USA. Due to problems with my health, I don't earn very much. Right now I am working part-time making $10.75 an hour for 13 hours a week, on average. I also make $100-$400 a month selling things that I make, but it's very irregular. I am on foodstamps and medicaid. 

I am 35 years old. My credit score is ~630 (I haven't checked it in a few months). I have $1300 in credit card debt, and ~$40k in student loans, ~$2,300 in unpaid medical bills.  I owe a friend of mine $270 (it was $600, I've been paying him slowly.)

I don't have to pay rent or a car payment, but I do have to pay for gas, $1200 a year in car insurance, $75 a month for the cable/internet (I can't eliminate this payment, it's part of the free-rent deal), and $75 a month for phone.

I have no savings, as I lost my 401k and used up all my savings dealing with my health problems. 

I was just accepted into a Masters program. I am going to take out more loans to pay for it. Tuition is $6k per semester. Professionals in my chosen field make anywhere from $40k to $120k annually, depending on how competitive they are. Some positions offer student loan forgiveness after 10 years of payments and pensions after 25 years.

I'm currently working full time while going to school, and I bring in about $3,600 a month (more if I pick up extra shifts).  Right now, I'm putting $350 a month toward the loan mentioned above.  I also put $450 a month toward a saving's account.  Right now, that currently has $8,997,37 with a 0.75% APY.

I'm studying to be a nurse practitioner, and my program is set up such that I do theory classes now, and then do 4 semesters of clinical rotations - which is essentially a full-time job.  I work full-time as an RN now, but will have to cut down to very part-time next year for my clinical rotations.  I'm also living as cheaply as I can now so that I can save up to be able afford to not work full-time next year (this is what the $450 a month is for).  When I start my clinical rotations, I'll be moving back home and my mom won't ask for rent or utilities and she'll probs buy my food.  My expenses will shrink even more at that point.

 So far, I've tried to get a home equity loan to cover it without success, even though I have about 60k in equity. I've tried getting 0% balance transfers through a few CCs recently also without success.  I was told today my credit score is 691.  My housing payment is 1451, utilities are about 240, and car is modern and paid for.

 I'm not increasing my debt at all since getting a job, but I feel there's a finally smarter way of just attacking from highest interest to lower.  I've looked into Prosper and Lending Club for a loan but their interest rates are more than my highest credit card.  I recently talked to a member of Rescue One Financial that is trying to get me into a freedom debt relief program by lowering balances from all my credit card into one payment.  This sounds nice theoretically but I don't want to damage credit for the future.  Anybody with advice or experience with that

Wife and I decided on a $500k condo in a coveted neighborhood. We can put down 20%, no problem. Our credit scores are each over 760. Been working at our companies over 5 years. We have been pre-approved by several banks during out home search the past one year+. Here is where I TIFU.

I choose a mortgage bank and started working with the loan officer. We sit down and go over the closing costs, what my rate would be, etc. We request for an appraisal and have the condo questionnaire filled out. Appraisal comes back fine but questionnaire has some things that do not fit Fannie/Freddie guidelines for ""safe"" loans. The building is however FHA approved and they can get me an FHA loan. 

The loan officer said because of the unwarrantable status of the building, it is difficult find a bank willing to do a traditional loan. He said I would most likely get an adjustable rate loan with higher interest rate if I went with a smaller bank. Larger banks wouldnt even want to entertain the idea of a non-standard mortgage. 

Because I have a short commitment date (up in a week), I feel like this is all or nothing. If I don't take the FHA loan and continue to shop around, I will miss my commitment date and the seller may find another buyer (this location is popular). 

Did I mess up by not using a mortgage broker first? What are my best options now? Take the FHA loan and then try to refinance in a few years if the building becomes warrantable?",finance,1415842386

I've been living rent-free with my grandfather for roughly 3 years and in exchange my mother and I take care of him 24/7 between the two of us. My only expenses are food/gas (I use his car) and my mother takes care of everything else. For the last year, my grandfather has been giving me about $3,000-$4,000/month which is a pretty standard rate for 24/7 care in CA. In fact, my mom used to get $4,000/month from another elderly person's family before she moved here. I have been putting everything into several savings account which stand at around $45,000 total. I have paid no taxes on anything. I thought it was ok because it was a gift, but I'm starting to worry that there are laws on how much money can be gifted but I don't know where to find that kind of information.

I want to invest my money to receive a higher return but I don't even know where to start. I keep seeing that low-cost index-funds are a good start but when I go to the site there's hundreds of them and it's insanely overwhelming. How do you pick out the good ones?

Me: 25, $42,400 gross salary, very stable job, $23,000 in student loan debt at 0% interest (family type deal). 722 credit score

Husband: 25, $42,00 gross salary (technically hourly but he's a paramedic so it's a consistent schedule), $5,400 student loan debt at 3.86% interest. $250/month car payment on a 2014 Ford Focus (we just bought after months of searching, he desperately needed a new car). 714 credit score

Money stuff: We bring home about $4600 post tax each month. We save about $1000+ consistently since June. We are still working on raising this number to $1500 but I don't think we really need budget advice (we use Republic Wireless for our phones, don't have cable, just Netflix, rarely eat out, etc.)

We have $10,000 in an emergency fund, which is closer to 3 or 4 months of expenses but like I said above, both our jobs are very stable. We have about $5,000 in a savings account that we just...have. I was lucky and got a huge unexpected bonus so we just received this recently. It caused us to start thinking about buying, because we would just love to own a home. We're thinking about starting a family soon, we like the area we live in, low cost of living, etc.

House stuff: We currently pay $1200 in rent for a nice enough house. It's not a place I love coming home to, but it's not a shithole by any means. HOWEVER, I am Native American, so I qualify for a Section 184 loan. The minimum we would have to put down is 2.25% (we will probably put down more), there is no PMI (there is a 1.5% fee rolled into the loan, but I added it up and after 21 months the fee becomes a better deal. We will certainly be in the house for longer than that). We would get a 3.75% interest rate. I am also eligible for a grant from my tribe of $2125 to help with a down payment or closing costs. We are looking at houses that are about $180,000. New builds, very efficient, lots of granite countertops and wood floors to satisfy all my yuppie nesting slightly maternal needs (that's kind of a joke...). Doing the math with estimated taxes and insurance and everything, it looks like we could pay about $1050 monthly.

This SEEMS like a good deal to us. Is there something we are missing? We definitely don't plan on being in the home for 30 years, so I don't think paying more in interest over a 30 year period is really an issue for us, if that makes sense.

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to use financial aid to pay off credit card debt?,"Before you answer please read my background. This is my first time posting here, so I will try to keep it brief. If you have pertinent questions, please feel free to ask.

At the beginning of the year, I was a top server at a decent restaurant but and I did not want to make a career out of it, I decided during the summer to apply to graduate school (I have a college degree, BS in Political Science, May 2012). I was admitted into the PhD program and offered a Teaching Assistant position. The position comes with pay and a scholarship; my tuition is completely paid for and I'm paid $1,170/month (after taxes). 

I left my job at the restaurant for the semester to focus on my studies (plus I am not technically allowed to have outside employment). So I accepted Federal Unsubsidized Stafford loans to cover living expenses.

Here is the catch. Early in the year I accepted what I thought was a marketing position, but turned out to be a pyramid scheme (amazingly stupid of me I know). What is worse, is that it took me a while to get paid so I got a couple of credit cards to pay for things and keep afloat (also stupid I know), as I had rent and other bills plus this shitty job required I wear a suit and tie, which I did not have. Also, in October, for lots of reasons, I paid to get out of my lease and move into a new place with my SO of 2 years, which obviously cost a good bit of money. I always made at least $2,000-2,500 a month at the restaurant so I was doing OK, but not great.

My current situation:

---approx. $4k in credit card debt (I know, stupid of me to do but I definitely learned my lesson). These DO NOT start accruing interest until May of this year (2014).

---received $8k this semester in financial aid, and will get another $8k in January. The school must disperse the same amount each semester in a given school year. I DO NOT have to accept the full amount next year but I already did this year. 

---I make $1,170 (after taxes) on the first of every month through June 1. I will not have income from the school in July, August or September (as the fiscal year starts in Sept. and thus we get our first paycheck in October)

---I have zero dollars saved. My bills (rent, and obligations not including food, gas and entertainment) are about $1,300/month. This includes payments on my credit card, car payment, car insurance, cell phone plan. 

---My car payment is $230/month and the total loan is worth a little over $12k. I have made two payments so far.

---By my math, I only really need about $1,000/month in addition to my pay to be comfortable. Meaning I really only need $5k out of the $8k in financial aid next semester. 

---When my semester ends on 12/10, I will be able to work shifts at the restaurant for about a month, plus I have some extra work for the university over the next two weekends that will pay me an extra $1,100 by 12/15. In addition, due to my course schedule I might be able to work a shift a week during next semester which would give me an extra $200 or so a month.

---Also, my GF (who I live with and split expenses with) has a salary position as a school teacher (approx. $40k/year after taxes) and a very generous amount in savings. She is financially stable, and we are moving towards getting engaged sometime next year, most likely. So I have a major interest in minimizing my debt and financial insecurity as much as possible NOW. 

These are my questions: Would it be a bad idea to use part of my financial aid next semester to pay off my credit card debt before it starts accruing interest? If it is a bad idea, what should I do?

What should be my next moves financially? The next full school year will be much like this one as far as expenses and income. However, after this, I will be able to start lecturing while writing my dissertation and so I will not need to accept as much, if any, financial aid. I want to get my PhD with as little debt as possible.

I know this was a lot of information, but I tried to keep it brief. Thanks for reading this and I welcome any useful advice I can get.",finance,1415849840

Sen sijaan se on huomaavaista laajentamista Civilization-sarjan osaksi tulevaisuuden aikakauteen, mielekkäitä muutoksia mekaniikka että järkeä yhteydessä tarina.

Mitä se tarina, lähtökohta on pohjimmiltaan, että maapallo on kollektiivisesti koonnut suuren Expeditionary voima, vetää ihmisiä eri kansojen, etsiä ja asuttaa uusia maailmoja.Valloittajat kotoisin monenlaisia taustoja, ja sen sijaan, että jaetaan kansakunnan kuin ne olivat aiemmissa Civilization-pelejä, he sponsoroi eri järjestöjen ja tavoitteet kyseisten järjestöjen ilmoitettava ryhmittymän ominaisuuksia.

Sponsorit ovat myös Arc, joka loistaa salaisia operaatioita; MLB, joka tarjoaa 10% bonuksen lähitaistelua; Ranskalais-Iberia, joka on teknologian painopiste; Kavithan suojelualue, joka on hyvä laajentaa kautta kolonisaatio; Pan Asian Osuuskunta, joka voi nopeasti kehittää maata ja rakentaa ihmeitä; Afrikkalainen unionin maatalouden voimanpesä; Polystralia, joka hyötyy parempi kauppa; ja slaavilainen Federation, joka on vahva uutena lisätty kiertoradan kerros osa peliä. Pelaajat myös käydä läpi lyhyt bonus valinta kun aloitetaan uusi peli, joka antaa heille erilaisia laskuolosuhteet ja ensimmäisen puolestaan bonuksia kun alkaa.

Että kiertoaika kerros on uuden kartan tasolle, joka on olemassa pinnan yläpuolella maasto, jossa pelaajat voivat ottaa käyttöön satelliittien ja yksiköitä antamaan alueen laatat (ja yksiköiden) erityiset pelattavuus bonuksia, kuten nopeampaa paranemista, parempaa resurssien kerääminen, suojaa syntyperäinen planeettojen vaaroja ja enemmän. Orbital yksiköissä on ajoitettu elämä; aivan aidolta satelliitteja, he työskentelevät joukko painejaksomäärän ja sitten ne palavat harmittomasti ilmakehään. Se on rikas lisäominaisuus, ja yksi, joka tarvitaan kunnostautua kehittynyt vaikeuksia pelin, vaikka löysin pelaaminen helpompaa tilat tarkoitti sitä, että jos et ole täysin varma siitä, miten parhaiten pelata uusi mekaanikko kun alkaa, se uskaltaisi 't tuntuvasti satuttaa kokemus.

Myös uusi peli ovat yhteenkuuluvuus, ja nämä ovat ydin Civilization: Beyond Maan kokemus. On kolme affiniteeteilla peliin, ja nämä edustavat pistejärjestelmä perusteella, miten päätät ohjata oman yhteiskunnan [**teknologisen**](https://plus.google.com/u/0/104367194723827265861/posts) kehityksen. Tech Civilization: Beyond Maa ole täysin lineaarinen; se on verkossa, ja voit tehdä valintoja kyseisessä jotka suosivat erilaista lähestymistapaa kolonisoitumaan vieraaseen maailmaan. Jotkut tekniikat, kun tutkitaan, tulee avata Affinity pistettä, ja saada taso erityinen side vaikuttaa suuntaan laitteen kehitystä.

Kpl Civilization: Beyond maapallon ovat erilaisia, liian - et vain tutkia kunkin uuden yksikön tyyppi, vaan valitse päivityksiä muutaman perusluokkia yksikköä (maa-, ilma- ja meri aseellisten taistelijoiden enimmäkseen), joka perustuu omaan Affinity etenemiseen. Kaikki olemassa olevat yksiköt päivittyvät automaattisesti, ratkaista yksi suurimmista päänsärkyä viimeisen Civilization yksikkö evoluutio, ja muutokset eivät maksa mitään. Tämä tekee Affinity järjestelmä tärkeää saada sotilaallisen yliotteen, niin voit keskittyä teknologian tutkimus nopeuttaa edistymistä järjestelmän tasoilla ja saada päivitykset nopeammin.

Kolme affiniteeteilla pelissä ovat Harmony, puhtaus, ja Supremacy. Harmonia tarkoittaa pelaaja on olennaisesti päättänyt työskennellä yhdessä planeetan ainutlaatuisen ympäristön ja syntyperäinen luontoa, ja he saavat attribuutteja ja yksikön tyyppien mukaisesti. He tulla immuuneja myrkyllisiä myrkkyhöyry että dots kartta laatat, esimerkiksi ja jopa saada harrastaja siitä vastaavasti, ja he kehittävät yksiköt, jotka sisältävät ulkomaalainen petoja. Puhtaus pelaajat pyrittävä säilyttämään ihmisten tavoin, ja omaksua Maan Tech menneisyyden, samalla parantaa sitä. He päätyvät valtava tulivoima, ja hyvä puolustus. Supremacy kattaa evoluution teknologian, mukaan lukien kybernetiikkaa ja AI. Pelaajat tässä Affinity on yksiköitä, jotka saavat ylimääräistä hyökkäys bonuksia, ja robotteja, jotka ovat erityisen vahva alue.

Pelaa läpi nämä löysin luonnollinen taipumus pyrkivät kohti Harmony Affinity, mutta jokainen pelaaja on erityinen tyyli pelattavuus ja affiniteetit voi täydentää näitä eri tavoin. Kokeminen kaikki (ja erilaisia yhdistelmiä edellä) tarjoaa paljon pelattavaa peliin yleistä.

Samoin Tech Web, joka on ei-lineaarinen, eikä tarkoitus saattaa päätökseen kokonaan pelin lopussa, tarjoaa paljon erilaisia pelaajia läpi heidän toisella yrittämällä. Techs myös nyt sisäkkäin, niin että on olemassa niin sanottu varsi teknologioita, joilla on kaksi lehtiä techs alla. Tutkiminen haluttu lehtiä tech vaatii oppimista varsi teknologian ensimmäinen, mutta voit napsauttaa perimmäinen haluttu teknologian tutkimukseen kaikki edellytykset ensimmäisen, liian. Tech peli tuntuu vähemmän kuin Syöte marssi läpi historian, ja enemmän kuin joukko valintoja siitä, miten parhaiten vastata yksilöllisiin tarpeisiin erityinen tilanne, tässä tapauksessa tähtienvälisen etsintä. Se ehkä tuntuu vähemmän grand kuin aiemmissa peleissä, mutta vapauttamalla sen potentiaali on yhtä hauskaa.

Muita uusia ominaisuuksia tässä pelissä ovat myös terveys- ja jahdit. Terveys rajoittaa kykyäsi kasvaa nopeasti ja liittää uusiin kaupunkeihin tehokkaasti tuomalla rangaistus liikakasvuun. Torjumiseksi, sinun täytyy varustaa aina kaupunkien tilat, jotka tarjoavat terveyteen bonus, ja unohdetaan se tulee nopeasti johtaa sakkoihin tuottavuuteen, kauppaa ja muita tekijöitä, jotka voivat vakavasti vaikuttaa teidän kyky käydä sotaa, tai tutkimukseen riittävän nopeasti pysyä. Oma pelityyli suosii sotilaallista voittoa, onnistuu nopeasti asuttaminen ja valloittaminen, joten tämä osoittautui vaikeaksi muutos tottua. Silti se on hyvä haaste, joka on järkevää logiikkaa pelin maailmassa, ja sotilaallinen pelaajat voivat silti saada jollies kun ne tulevat toimeen sen kanssa.

Jahdit syntyy aina, kun rakentaa uuden rakennuksen tyyppi, tai kun törmätä erityinen laatta kartalle. Rakennus liittyviä tehtäviä vain pyytää sinua tekemään pysyvä valinta siitä, millaista bonus, että rakenne tarjoaa, ja kartta quests liittyy yleensä tutkimusmatkailijat kehittää laatta tai lähettämällä yksikkö tarkistaa jotain. Ne tarjoavat mielenkiintoisia erilaisia keskellä yleistä jauhaa Civ perinteinen vuoropohjainen pelattavuus, ja ovat mukava lisä yleinen kokemus, joka tuntuu luonnolliselta.

Voittaa Civilization: Beyond Maan, voit joko tuhota kaikki muutkin (valitsemani tapa voittaa) poistamalla kaikki niiden pääkaupungit ja tärkeimmissä kaupungeissa, yhteyttä älykäs entinen planeetan asukas rotu, hyökätä maahan, jos olet Supremacy pelaaja, escort ja asettua valtuuskunta maasta jos olet Puhtaus pelaaja, tai tullut yksi planeetan kanssa, jos olet Harmony pelaaja.Kolme Affinity voittoja vaativat rakentaa endgame rakenne, joka on samanlainen kuin avaruudessa voittoja edelliset pelit. Kaikki sanelee ainutlaatuinen tyyli pelattavuus, mutta kaikki tarjoavat hauska kokemus.Hienosäädön taistelujärjestelmä ja yksikön kehitys tarkoittaa olen vielä enemmän sotilaallisen valloituksen fani kuin koskaan, mutta siitä huolimatta (tai ehkä juuri) lisäksi Terveyden estää karannut sotilaallista ylivaltaa.

Loppujen lopuksi tämä on totta Civilization peli, ja arvoisensa seuraajan eeppisen Civilization V Sen scifi-määritteitä tarkoittaa pelin suunnittelijat saivat levittää siipiään hieman tavallista enemmän, ja mekaniikka käyttöön täällä takaisin ylös mielikuvituksellinen , mutta myös realistinen, visio tulevaisuudesta, jossa avaruuskolonian on seuraava askel ihmiskunnalle.

personalfinance,Help with refinancing student loans (93k debt),"I only have student loan debt, I make around 60-65k/yr (which should be fairly steady and dependable). I have ~8k in the bank and pretty much have been keeping it at that level and paying extra on my loans whenever I exceed that. I just did a ridiculously expensive vacation and switched jobs (both were planned events) and expect to be in this job for awhile. 

I graduated from grad school 18 months ago, and have chipped away from ~106k to 93k (In the last 12 months I have paid about 19k into my loans). My current plan is paying the minimums on the lower interest loans and paying whatever I can afford on the higher interest loan - this allows me some flexibility, especially since I previously worked some temporary/contract jobs and I had more variability with my pay. Now that I am settling into a permanent job, I am hoping to budget ~$1000-1200/month towards paying off loans. 


(principle remaining / interest)

$814.53	2.08%

$7,912.32	6.55%

$3,656.63	5.75%

$25,500.00	6.55%

$35,737.28	6.55%

$14,603.95	7.65%

$4,864.44   5.00%

These are all public loans managed by great lakes (except for one of the smaller ones). Consolidating through them does not seem helpful - I auto pay anyways and it doesn't give me a better interest rate.

 Would the positives of refinancing through something like sofi.com make sense if I can get a lower interest rate? Am I missing any risks?

My main goal is finding a way to decrease my interest rates - I don't mind the higher monthly payments. 

Are there benefits to staying within the public loan set up I am in? I don't anticipate going into public/non-profit work (I'm in the medical field) long enough to take advantage of loan deferment programs, and I don't anticipate I will be going back to school and taking advantage of further deferment.

This sounds scumbaggish and daern robot just landed on a comet, but the truth is that I honestly don't know what to do and I'm not sure I'm getting the greatest/unbiased advice from friends and family members who are more familiar with this stuff.

Should I pay off all of this debt now with the new money?  Invest and let the investment pay off the loan?  Just invest and pay the loans off with my income?  Will the coming global military conflict absolve me of my debt?

Thanks for any insight you guys can give.",finance,1415851769
personalfinance,"Pay off loans, buy a house, quit Big Law, none of the above?","Here's my situation: 

* I have enough money in the bank to pay off all of my student loans (undergrad, LLM, JD).  
* If I paid off my loans today, I'd have about 60K left over and no debt, not assets (except for a new car). 
* I've got my eye on a house--it's about 90-100K. 
* I'm a lawyer, and I work for a Big Law firm. I hate it so much, and I want out. Everyday might be the day I quit. It's bad. 
* Wife, 2 kids (both babies still)--all's good there. 

So, everyone tells me I'm stupid for not paying of my loans and buying a house already. But my gut tells me that I can do something smarter with this money--make it make me some money. 

I'm not into saving for retirement. Screw that. I'd rather take my chances--I don't want to save up for a future that may never come. If I end up being a broke and toothless as an old man than, so be it. I'm just fed up with being a sniveling pencil pusher.  

So, my question is, what the heck should I do with this money? Even if I quit my current job, I need a pace to stay so, maybe buying a modest (90-100k) house is worth it. 

I know this isn't much for you all to work with, but if you ask me questions, I'll respond, and maybe you could help me brainstorm.

Bitcoin,Any fundamental reason or just bitcoin being bitcoin,"Bitcoin doesnt generally react to fundamentals, but is it in this case? Aside from the Winklevoss ETF Im not sure what could trigger this:

""The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is likely to pass federal scrutiny and become the first digital currency-based exchange traded fund (ETF), maybe before the end of the year, although no one knows for sure, according to ETF analysts. "" 

http://www.ibtimes.com/winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-will-likely-pass-federal-scrutiny-eventually-experts-say-1626106

Although no mention from Coindesk:

""t should be noted that the biggest price rally in bitcoin history – rocketing from under $300 to over $1,000 – started almost exactly a year ago to the day.

This spike did not last long, however, and bitcoin's value began falling in December, followed by a protracted period of extreme volatility.

It's always hard, if not impossible, to pin down the exact cause of price changes. Last year’s rally came just a few weeks after the FBI closed illicit black market Silk Road.

While some may argue that the latest rally roughly coincides with the seizure of Silk Road 2.0 and numerous other dark web sites just days ago, it's impossible to correlate the two events for certain.

Other factors suggested by community members include the celebration of ‘Singles Day’ in China, which is known to generate a lot of e-commerce traffic.

Data from Blockchain points to a steady increase in the number of daily transactions, although that change is not followed by a corresponding rise in transaction fees. This, in turn, points to a greater number of non-commercial transactions taking place.""",cryptocurrency,1415853558

politics,Politics 101: Midterm Ballot Initiatives Recap,"The Midterm Elections are over and there has been a huge amount of coverage discussing the Republican victories in the House and Senate. As we all know by now, the Republicans have gained control of the Senate and many of the ""close"" races ended up not being very close at all. However, there has not been much discussion about the ballot initiatives that passed and failed across the US (aside from the marijuana legalization measures). So, let's check it all out.

&amp;nbsp;

##This Politics 101 post will discuss:

* Ballot initiatives in cities and states across the USA and whether they passed or failed.
* Trends and the potential measures for 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

##Discussion

We'd like the discussion this week to really focus on why so many progressive ballot measures passed and yet so many Republicans were elected to Congress. What does this say about the US and our political parties? Which of these ballot initiatives do you think is the most promising?

##Summary of Trends and Potential for 2016 

&amp;nbsp;

*MOST POPULAR:* 

People highly favored the raising of the minimum wage and it succeeded in every state where it appeared on the ballot. This issue will almost certainly show up on ballots in more states in 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

*LEGALIZE IT:* 

Marijuana legalization/decriminalization is becoming increasingly popular and it is HIGHLY probable that it will appear on the ballot in upcoming elections. The issue is gaining momentum and continued success could lead to significant changes at a federal level. 

&amp;nbsp;

*IT'S ALIVE!:*

Personhood made it on to several state ballots this year, but did not fare well. Only the more tempered version in Tennessee succeeded. Proponents for personhood may take this as a sign that less aggressive wording will garner better results at the polls while also achieving the same ends. I would not be surprised to see more restrained personhood bills in future elections. 

&amp;nbsp;

*IS THAT....EDIBLE?:*

GMO labeling also appears to be an increasingly hot topic and I expect that the issue will be raised again in 2016.

personalfinance,need advice about my defaulted student loan,"So recently (like in the past 3 months or so) I've been getting calls from a collection agency...I've been juggling forbearance and paying what I can from time to time so I had been used to these kinds of calls, except I know for a fact that I had mostly gotten my shit together (as in everything was current and either on a payment plan or in forbearance).  I finally really talk to the girl and I find out its for my loan that apparently came directly from my school when sallie mae and federal grants didn't cover the whole thing, so it wasn't put into forbearance or included in my payment plan.  She says its for like 2200 and 500 of that is a default fee.  I'm like wtf I haven't heard anything about this how has it defaulted and she tells me it has been in default since June 1, 2006.  
I was a full time student from aug 05-dec 10 and then took enough credits to be full time from 11-12 after getting my degree because it was more affordable than paying back my loans (like $800/semester at a comm college)
Point being, my loan should have been in deferral at the time since I was a full time student.  The collections girl said she would have her people look into it but I don't hold up much hope for that.  What can I do? There is no reason that loan should have been in default for that long and it really doesn't even make sense. 

[a little back story..i have almost 60g in debt. it was only like 50ish when i graduated but jumped to after like a year 75 because some of my loans had 14%(!!) fucking bullshit interest. i also cannot afford to pay off the loan currently]



tldr: loan has been in default since june 06 even though i was a full time student from aug 05-dec 10 &amp; then again aug 11- may 12. don't know what to do &amp; refuse to pay $500 default fee

Bitcoin,My first reddit post is my Bitcoin story,"Long time listener, first time caller here..

It was around this time last year that I dove face first into bitcoin.  I've heard the term in passing while watching YouTube videos on the inevitable collapse of the US dollar and the subsequent implementation of marshal law.  Every time I would watch these oh so light hearted presentations, along with impending doom, I remember always having the same mixed feelings.  I was constantly torn between a compulsion to combat the tyranny of the Federal Reserve's big banking system or surrender to the herd mentality, which most of us live by.  What was a lowly peasant like myself to do?  Well, after reading ""the"" white paper, and a few thousand videos later, I slowly began comprehend what bitcoin was all about.  Finally, even though minute in scale, there was a way the average schmuck could finger the Fed, without actually ending up in prison.

So I started with coinbase(since it was a little cheaper than Mt.Gox), jumped through all the flaming hoops of verification, and started purchasing small amounts of Bitcoin.  After that, I indulged my curiosity in cloud mining with CEX.io and even purchased some cryptostocks from the site of the same name.  Albeit, these were some expensive lessons to learn.  In hindsight, more research was in order, however the active participation morphed into a fix.  I began reading as much as I could, studying charts, I even the I posted a few nooby questions and ideas on Bitcoin discussion forum.  Most of my comments and questions were met with technocratic arrogance, which is fine. A couple things that new users should keep in mind: 

1.Never let anyone discourage your search for knowledge and truth, because guess what, this technology is so new that anyone who acts like they know it all, are typically full of poo.

2.Ask questions, make suggestions, help each other out.  The more people that get involved can only make this community stronger.  Lets face it, this is not designed to be an elitist social club.  More widespread adoption and understanding adds value to the network.

So much for keeping this short...but in closing I just want to touch upon what researching bitcoin has done for me and will hopefully happen for others.  We are talking about, philosophy, mathematics, economics, cryptology, computer science, and that's just the surface.  Once I got passed the frustration of not having a PhD in these fields and just soaked in as much as I could, at my own pace, I noticed that my mind started exploding with ideas and possible applications.  For example, one of the first things I realized was that information could be time stamped in the blockchain.  Being an advocate of free speech, this fact is monumental for me.  Moreover, since the mainstream media is so controlled anymore, I believe that peer to peer connections are the way to truly stay informed these days and the next to come.  Substantiated or not, I already get my news from my facebook feed and similar sites.  

Furthermore, it's not just about the paradigm shift of power.  I don't really like the term de-centralized.  We are not simply moving away from something that is centered, and on to it's polar opposite.  This is something totally new.  I'm akin to words that sound more proactive and fresh, because this stuff really is so very new and fresh gentlemens.  The fact that anyone in the universe can participate makes it more than just de-centralized.  For me, it makes it universalized.

I hope someone likes my little story.  I am obviously not the most academic or technical person, so there was some trepidation that led to hesitation on my part for posting anything on reddit.  But I'm glad to be over that now and I aspire to share more.  Maybe some folks will be encouraged to do the same.  The more voices and ideas the better.",cryptocurrency,1415867261
personalfinance,Possibly making a lump sum overseas (CN),"Hi guys, I'm looking for some additional opinions or advice on my situation.  I am helping a friend sell his company.  I will be entitled to 5% of the final sale price if we are successful.  We are expecting to sell the company at around $10M USD, so I am looking at a possible lump sum of $500K.  The problem (or perhaps advantage) is that this deal is occurring in China.  I am a US citizen.  My own preliminary research suggests that opening a company in Hong Kong to receive the payment might be the best way to go.

If I take the 500K as personal income, I will need to pay Chinese income tax, marginal rates on everything above $100K in US federal income tax (the US has a $100K foreign earned income exclusion), and CA state tax.  This does not feel optimal to me.

If I have the money sent to a company in Hong Kong, I think that HK doesn't collect taxes on any money earned outside of Hong Kong, but I don't know much about what I would do after that.  How would I get this money to myself to use personally?

If I have it sent to ""myself"" in the US, I would have to pay all of the regular income taxes.  This seems to be the worst option.  California would take $39K alone, Federal would be $152K according to online resources.

I do not have much money at all.  This is a life-changing sum that will give me a lot more flexibility and options moving forward, so every percent saved matters to me.  That's why I am interested in making sure I plan this out at least close to optimally and not make any big mistakes.",finance,1415867434

Instead of trying to move 22mil in cash in dufflebags and suitcases (presumably $100 bills) physically from the USA to this bank in Switzerland they were trying to get to, they could have just bought $50kBTC, tumbled it a bit, and then sold that on a European exchange somewhere, wiring the result to swiss bank.

If BTC volatility did not frighten them then they also could have just held the BTC and cut the swiss bank out completely (which, if you've seen the movie would have made a redonkulous difference in the outcome.. :P).

Now I do not condone the fashion in which these stock fraudsters *made* their money, basically robbing from greedy investors, but said money is no better off being stolen a second time by the US federal government either: two wrongs do not make a right. 

But most importantly, there exists no compelling reason for individuals to be forced to broadcast to the government how much wealth they possess nor where they are moving it or how they are handling it. It is entirely possible for honest individuals who have legitimately earned their keep to want to be discrete about their finances: that should not have to be anybody's  business but their own. :P

personalfinance,How much is enough to start looking into more complex investment? Inheritance advice (AU),"Hi all,

Just read some of the advice in a post about someone who has just inherited a very large amount of money.

This has got me thinking about my own situation. Within the next few months I stand to inherit a bit of money, not as much as the other poster but about AUD400-450k.

For context:

- I'm engaged, have about 30k savings with my SO, expecting wedding to cost about 25k
- mortgage, approx 350k, interest rate 4.91%, in an offset arrangement (30k in offset)
- HECS (Aus university tuition loan) debt of about 25k
- Australian... obviously.

We have been thinking we will pay for wedding, honeymoon, probably get a new car as we are in need (30kish), and the rest can go on the mortgage and we'll start working towards our next house, and retain our current townhouse as a rental property.

I'd be interested to know if anyone has suggestions about better ways we can make this money work for us, without taking on too much risk? I'm conscious that it is a lot of money if you look at it as a lump sum but over a long period, if mismanaged it could seem like it just disappeared. Then again, maybe it's not enough to be worth investing, using the interest generated, etc. Where is that line?

The family member who left it behind worked so hard for it and will never get to enjoy it as they should have. I want to make the most of it.

I know that I will be paying more in the long run and I will have a longer amount of time to pay off the loans, but I feel like getting them down to a lower monthly payment is a good idea, plus I could always still pay in the same amount and pay off more of the principle if I want to right?",finance,1415885401

Over the summer I was laid-off from my job, and we decided together that this was a good opportunity for me to go to grad school to become a CPA. My layoff came at exactly the time my boyfriend received a pay raise equal to my lost salary. Currently he pays for food and rent, and I cover tuition and all my personal expenses from savings and federal student loans. Before losing my job, I had been saving half my income for several years, along with aggressively paying off my student loans from undergrad. Finances are not tight. We are planning on getting married about a year and a half, after I finish school. This timing will not negatively impact my financial aid. I anticipate graduating with a combined 15-20k in student loans from undergrad and grad school. We'll get married at the courthouse, with no reception.  
I'm very careful and meticulous when it comes to money. I make $500 per month on average just through credit card churning/ manufactured spending, and have never paid cc interest. I also place a high priority on investing for retirement. On the other hand, after deciding how much money to set aside, I spend 'fun' money on whatever I want without guilt. I anticipate that we will be earning similar salaries within a few years after I graduate.  
My boyfriend earns more than double what I did before losing my job. He has carried large credit card balances in the past, and wasn't bothered by the amount of interest he was paying. He has no savings or retirement accounts. On the upside, his financial behavior has drastically improved over the past year, and he no longer carries any debt.  
Neither of us want children. We've lived together 4 years, so I'm not worried about disputes over living arrangements. Do you think I should pay 100% of my student loans alone if we get married?

dogecoin,Doge Market Analysis 13/11/2014,"Current price: 58/57 Satoshi 24 hr volume: $1,084,030 Ranking #3 for liquidity 24hr Change (USD) +5.33%

Observations: Bitcoin went on a strong bull run yesterday breaking the $370 mark into $430! Bitcoin has been in a bear market  probably since the collapse of Mt.Gox. It tends to have an annual cycle of a really aggressive bull market with record breaking highs. Then it gradually slumps back down, but its lows are usually higher than previous lows. It's too early to tell but if Bitcoin goes back up on an aggressive trend than this is excellent news for Dogecoin, heres why...

When Bitcoin goes up it tends to drag up all the rest of its kingdom with it. 70% of all crytpo has seen a sharp increase in price over the past 24 hours. More importantly the volume has trippled for most coins including Doge. Earlier this week we were hitting $260,000-$320,000 and now we broke the million mark again. Yesterday there were a few knee jerk reactions to Bitcoin's price spike by dumping lots of doge on the market. Perhaps this wasn't the result of “whales” but it was definitely a pack of well fed dolphins ;-) This volatility made for excellent trading conditions, big waves = fun surfing. Overall, Doge has since stabilized a bit and has maintained an increase in USD value. 

In the big picture, if Bitcoin goes back into a bull cycle we will see a strong market increase in new Shibes. When Bitcoin prices break records, it attracts lots of mainstream media hype and a new wave of crypto enthusiasts flood the market. This will be great for Doge because the dogecoin community is more welcoming and light hearted for new commers to learn. Doge has a way of attracting new people that weren't previously into crypto. 

It's not productive to compete directly with Bitcoin and Litecoin for the #1-#2 spot (although Doge has #2 largest crypto community.) A more strategic approach is to leverage natural archetypes and position ourselves as the unquestionable #3 of crypto. Historically all coins came in gold, silver and copper. We are part of the new trinity of crypto and if we stay relevant we will all make it to the moon together. Our advantage is that we're the friendliest community in crypto and if we meet adversity with kindness, we will win the hearts and minds of our crypto comrades.",cryptocurrency,1415889046
personalfinance,Payroll lower than expected?,"I'm a 20 year old working in a grocery market in Washington state where the minimum wage is $9.32. My gross wage is $9.42. My payroll is weekly. The past 7 days, I worked 39 hours. My net pay was $285.23. Now, with some calculations, the monthly net pay /hour is $7.31. That's $2.11 less than the gross hourly wage. To me, it just seems like it's way too much deducted.

When it comes to deductions, I'm clueless, besides the mandatory union I had to join, which is around ~$45 a month, but I know it wasn't deducted from this particular payroll. I know the easiest route is to ask the store manager about the details of my payroll deductions, but I'm afraid it might give off the wrong impression. I still do, however plan to talk to him. I want to read your responses before doing so. What type of deductions should I be expected to be taken from my payroll that it reduces my hourly net wage by ~21%?

I was literally clueless about 5 minutes ago until I did a quick Google search on payroll deductions and here's what I think is deducted:  
-Union $~45 /month.  
-Federal income tax  
-Some forgotten thing that I agreed on during job hiring process that deducts $0.50 from each payroll.  
No state income tax in Washington state.

Well, that's all I can think of. I don't get any benefits because I frequently work anywhere from 20-39 hours per week.

So should I talk to my store manager, or is this absolutely normal?

As an ending note, I find it almost mind-blowingly unfathomable how anyone can survive working on minimum wage, or in the case in Washington, live off and possibly be expected to raise a family on a net hourly wage of ~$7.31. I'm a student taking a break from school, making spare cash at the moment, with no expenses to pay at all, and I feel depressed just thinking about how people have to make a living working one more hour than I did (40 hours for fulltime work) and be expected support themselves without government assistance.

personalfinance,"About to marry into some student loans, looking for advice","Hey PF!

I've been a long time lurker here, as well as over in /r/investing.  I'd like to think I have a very solid head on my shoulders when it comes to finances, but would like some validation and/or tips from those who have gone through a similar situation.  Let's air out the dirty laundry:

I have a salary of $93k as a software developer in a pretty cheap city.  I've also been granted some stock options, being an early hire in a growing (but now stable) startup.  I can add details about those if it's deemed relevant for the discussion.

**Savings**

* $5,500/yr to a vanguard Roth IRA (index fund)
* $17,500/yr to company 401(k) (we have vanguard fund choices, but no matching)
* $3,300/yr to HSA (investing through TDAmeritrade into low-expense index fund)
* $800/mo to wedding/honeymoon savings ($13k currently saved, budgeting for $20k wedding + honeymoon)
* No emergency fund

This leaves me with about $3.5k take home pay a month.

**Bigger/Important Expenses**

* $60/mo car insurance (covers me and fiancee's cars)
* $308/mo on my 2009 Scion tC (4.25% interest, paid off in full next oct)
* $420/mo on fiancee's new 2014 Ford Escape (0% interest, ~4 years left)
* $780/mo on mortgage + home insurance + prop tax escrow (2.85% interest, 15yr fixed)
* No student loans

Now a little about my fiancee.  We've been together for almost 6 years now, and lived together for probably 5 of those years.  We're engaged and have a wedding scheduled for next June.  She doesn't have any monthly expenses, outside of a minimal budget for food and gas...and the rest of her income goes to her student loan balance.

**Her Loans**

* $34.6k private loans (split between 4 different places, averages around a 7-8% interest rate)
* $19.4k government loans (also split on the type, but I'd say about 4-5% average interest rate)

Right now she works in retail and brings home around $800/mo.  The minimum payment for all of her loans combined is roughly $700 or so a month, so that's where pretty much all of her income is going.  She's about to start an alternative teaching certification online program offered through the state so that she can become a science teacher.  Her degree is in geology, but there were very few prospects available to her upon graduating.

I'm worried, but not necessarily overwhelmed by the amount of student debt that we're going to be facing together once we're married.  I've read about different options, and I'm wondering which would be best considering our situation.

Should we just lower savings for a time and attack the highest interest loans first?

Should we consolidate the government loans and look into a repayment plan such as the IBR/ICR program?

Should we attempt to consolidate the private loans through a CU and aim for a lower interest/payment?

What I'm really concerned about right now is my fiancee essentially has no income available to her after these loans take their share.  This just doesn't feel right to me.  I know once we get married the situation doesn't look as bleak, but it will still cut into our savings dramatically (assuming we take an agressive repayment approach).  This isn't a woe is me post, this is simply an attempt to find the most efficient strategy here on a topic that I'm not very familiar with.",finance,1415896071

technology,Why do people think that giving the U.S. Federal Government full control over the U.S. Internet would be a GOOD thing for Net Neutrality?,"On the surface, the phrase sounds good, right? I mean, what could be better than a ""neutral"" internet? 

Then there's the statement put out by Obama. You can find the full text here: http://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality

I mean, go ahead, read it. Sounds wonderful, right? No blocking, no throttling, increased transparency, no paid prioritization! These bullet points are absolutely beautiful! Of COURSE we should have net neutrality! Obama's right on! Just read his statement!

Oh but wait... Isn't this the guy who has lied to us every single step of the way? Isn't this the guy that said we can ""keep our health plan""? (I lose mine starting 1 Jan.) Isn't this the guy that said we wouldn't be fined for not having health insurance? (You are currently being fined this year for 1% of your pre-tax income if you don't have health insurance. You won't know about it until April 15th when you file your taxes. This will go up to 2% on January 1st.)

Okay, but certainly he's not lying about this Net Neutrality thing, right? I mean, it's right there in black and white. But wait, what's this sentence in Obama's statement?

""If the FCC appropriately forbears from the Title II regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above — principles that most ISPs have followed for years — it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the Internet.""

Why does he like to use big words that aren't common in the English language now? Oh, that's right. So he can hide his deceptions, and then later say he never lied.

forbears - to politely refrain from

So what this sentence in his statement is saying, is that IF (and IF is a GIANT freaking word here) the FCC ""refrains"" from the ""Title II"" regulations that they don't NEED to use, everything will be hunky dorey. If.

At what point in history has the Federal Government ever REFRAINED from wielding any overreaching powers that they were given?

They also like to tout that ""The FCC is an independent agency"". What does that mean, exactly? The FEDERAL Communications Commission, with their website at FCC.Gov is independent of what, exactly? And how are they ""independent?"" Like the same way the FDA is independent? The folks that are so deep in the big pharmaceutical pockets that they ceased to answer to the people decades ago? (Literally half of the budget for the FDA comes directly from the pharmaceutical companies.)

And what's ""Title II"" anyway? Has anyone ever actually read the 333 page document?

As a matter of fact, yes. Yes I have.

Title II is the second section of the Communications Act of 1934. (You know, the act that established the FCC?) This act was enacted by Roosevelt in 1934, and since then, our entire communications system has ceased to advance technologically. Even our cell phone systems are still using the same basic technology we had in the 1930's.

Compare this to the internet. We've gone from using phone lines, to using copper cables, to using GLASS cables in the span of 20 years. We've gone from dialup, to satellites, to broadband. We're on the 6th iteration of the ""Internet Protocol"" (IP) that allows for enough IP addresses for every man woman and child to have a unique IP for every cell in their body. We're designing a ""cloud"" system that would allow any device with a screen (such as your cell phone) to have more computational power than any computer you've ever sat at, from anywhere in the world. We have literally gone from a handheld calculator being the most powerful computer in your house to putting the power of a supercomputer into a device of the same size in just decades.

Do you know WHY the internet has been able to technologically progress so incredibly rapidly for the past 20 years? Because the Federal Government was NOT IN CHARGE OF IT. (According to the Communications Act, it can take between 6 months to a year for anyone to make the most miniscule of changes to ANY protocol, all of which are REQUIRED to be rubber-stamped by the FCC.)

So what, exactly, is in Title II? For one, its primary focus is on the ""Carriers"", e.g., the people who provide the service. Currently, the internet is not regulated by the government in any way, which is why it's been so phenomenally successful in those countries where this is the case. (Not so much in China, Egypt, North Korea, etc.) By sticking the internet under Title II, you would then make anyone providing any sort of internet service a ""Carrier"" and thus, they would have to follow all the laws as laid out in Title II. One of which is the following:

""In case of failure or refusal on the part of any carrier to comply with the provisions of this section or of any regulation or order made by the Commission thereunder, such carrier shall forfeit to the United States the sum of $6,000 for each such offense, and $300 for each and every day of the continuance of such offense.""

Now, bear in mind that this act was written in 1934, so the dollar amounts are just minimums. This statement in Title II has made it clear that if you fall under Title II, you fall under the FEDERAL Communication's Commission's thumb. NOT just those provisions under Title II. And you can be fined into oblivion for failing to meet ANY regulations laid down in the act AS WELL AS ANY ORDERS that the FCC makes.

This is further clarified in section 205(a) (which I won't quote here as it's huge, and purposely confusing) which gives the FCC the full authority to charge ANYONE for ANYTHING at ANY time for ANY amount. This gives the FCC full control without any secondary checks and balances. (Still wondering why the phone systems are still so antiquated?)

Let's not also forget that this covers radio (which is why civilians are only permitted a tiny, short band of frequencies to use, resulting in the inability for us to have easy access to long-range hand-held radios) and the Cable system (which hey, how much do we all love our current Cable monopolies in our individual areas?)

So now that we've established that this does truly and fully put everything internet related into the hands of the Federal Government, let's look at some of the specifics.

""The Commission shall, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, prescribe regulations to implement this section, including regulations that--
(A) establish functional requirements, guidelines, and operations procedures for telecommunications relay services;
(B) establish minimum standards that shall be met in carrying out subsection (c);""

etc. etc. etc. Long story short, the Federal Government is now in charge of setting the standards for the internet. Not the people who, you know, developed the internet. All future advancement of the internet will not only grind to the same screeching halt our phone system did, there's every chance it could regress, and fall apart. Look forward to going back to the days of dialup speeds as more and more people use a system that's unable to advance. Say goodbye to the bandwidth intense invention of cloud computing.

Then there are little gems like this:

""(B) LIMITATION.--The requirement of subparagraph (A)shall not apply if, on the basis of the proceeding under paragraph(3)(A), the Commission makes (and includes in the report required by paragraph (3)(B)(iii)) a factual determination that market forces are securing rates and charges that are just and reasonable, as evidenced by rate levels, costs, complaints, service quality, and other relevant factors.""

This was specifically referring to phone services, but yes, the government is in charge of setting the rates that phone companies can charge you, both maximums AND MINIMUMS.

Currently, Google is working to establish a FREE internet for all people worldwide. Imagine that. FREE. Internet for FREE, for EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE. This is what happens when you allow the free market to work.

Now… How long do you think it will take a lobbyist from Comcast, Cox, Verizon, you name it, to run to the FCC, drop some money in someone's pocket, and have them pass a MINIMUM charge on the internet within the United States? Instead of switching to a different model like Google's (advertising) to gain revenue, or finding another way to succeed, it's way easier to drop a tiny fraction of a percent of your profits into an infinitely corrupted system to just have the competition ""lawed"" out. It happens all the time.  (Look no further than the FDA for gross examples.) 

Not to mention, what happens when the government decides that all conservatives, christians, or anyone else they disagree with fall under the title of ""terrorist"". Then they start shutting your sites down. It wouldn't even be hard, when the Federal Government is in charge. They'd just block your server IPs from the internet. This is LITERALLY as easy as typing your IP address into a text file. Wouldn't happen? Ask the Tea Party folks what happened with the IRS.

Or what if they decide they want to record and compile every text message, e-mail, website you browse, purchase you make, every single move you make online, and profile you to see if you're someone they should bring the hammer down on before you MIGHT make a move? Can't happen? Ask the NSA and the cell phone carriers. (Also, ask yourself why that was even possible. It was ONLY made possible through the Communications Act of 1934. Had the entire phone system been privately run and developed and constantly morphing like the internet is, they wouldn't have had the ability or resources to keep up and infiltrate enough private companies to spy on even a fraction of that scale in the first place.)

Think you're going to sneak that movie, or song without the government knowing? (You know you all do it.) Boom. Now they have ""probable cause"" to come after you for anything they want. And THEY get to set the fines.

Think you're going to encrypt what you do online? Or do it anonymously? How are you going to manage that, when the Federal Government is in charge of the standards and protocols?

Enjoy listening to your podcasts? Wait until they're regulated to oblivion. (This is why Howard Stern moved to satellite radio.) Joe Blow won't be able to even understand all of the laws that will be restricting them to the point that only the professionals will even try.

You can say goodbye to any anonymous social media, too. They're already wanting to get rid of the anonymity on the internet. How easy will it be when you don't get a say in it?

Personal blogs? Just wait until those get regulated the same way public broadcasts are. Better be sure to watch your language.

And I'm only touching on the tiniest thread of all that is in this 333 page document.

By putting the internet under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, you will NOT be insuring ""Net Neutrality"". It's very much quite the opposite. You will be insuring the death of the internet as we know it. You will be giving the government carte blanche to pass laws on the internet without even telling you, much less giving you the chance to vote on it.

Ted Cruise is right. It would absolutely ""be the Obamacare of the Internet"". And the liberals are lambasting him for it. We called PRECISELY what would happen if Obamacare were passed, because we read it. And we're calling PRECISELY what will happen if the internet is allowed to go into the Federal Government's hands. And we're right.

And Obama knows it. That's why he said ""If.""",technology,1415898278

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing and Credit Score,"I was hoping someone with a better background in finance could give me a little advice/some insight on the decision of whether or not to Refinance my student loans. My main concern with this is that it will tank my good credit score, due to the amount of loans I have already taken out this year.  

some background info:  I have an obscene amount of student loans. I have federal, private, and parent plus. It sucks, but I am learning to live with it.  

Currently my Private loans are the worst. They are through Chase bank and they amount to 458.00 a month alone. I have four total loans through them, but they take everything out as one payment and divide it up amongst the four loans as needed. (They are not consolidated.) I obtained these loans in 2007-2009, so obviously I have like the worst interest rates ever. (I believe one is 6%, two are 9%, and one is 11% - yikes I know.)  

I have been paying all of these loans for about a year and a half now, on time. Never late, never missed a payment. I was just sent a letter from Charter One. They are now offering student loan refinancing for mucchhh lower interest rates. I can even take my loan payment period from 20 to 15 years and still save about 100.00 a month. I don't want to refinance my federal loans since it likely won't save me much and I don't want to risk losing any potential benefits I might receive later, from the government.

However, I am really interested in refinancing for my private loans because I can get down to like 3% interest instead of 11%. Here is a link to Charter One's refinance loan if it helps: http://www.charterone.com/student-loans/education-refinance-loan-overview.aspx. 

I'm just a little hesitant. Is this all it's cracked up to be? Should I be wary? I know it will help me in the long run by lowering my payment, but I just feel so nervous about borrowing AGAIN. Even if it IS replacing what I've already borrowed. 

Part of reason I'm so nervous about this, which I briefly mentioned is that I have already taken out a fair amount of loans this year. (All of which are being paid on time with no problems.) I have a pretty decent credit score of about 759 (could vary, explanation below).

* In April I was approved for an air miles credit card with a limit of 2500. (In the last week, I found out they have actually raised my credit limit from 2500 to 6500 without me asking, current balance is like 200.00)
* In August I took out an 8,000.00 car loan (From a bank not the dealership.)  
*  Around September I got sucked into the ""coupon hype"" at a store I regularly shop at and agreed to get a credit card. The highest limit anyone can get at this store is 500.00 (which I got), and I almost never use the card. 0.00 balance currently. Still though.  
*  Literally two days ago I financed a 1,500.00 laptop. (mine tanked, and I work on a laptop for a living so no choice here.) I was approved for 2,000 and spent 1497 - Should have this paid off pretty quickly.


will all of these loans I have already taken out tank my credit score if I try to go and and apply for a 50,000 student refinance loan? When I applied for my car loan they told me my credit score was 759, My credit card offers a tool where they show you your FICO score and the trend, and as of today it lists 745. I'm assuming this is temporary from pulling my credit the last two times but I want it to remain temporary. 

I could really use the lower payments but don't want to screw myself. I know a good credit score is an important thing to have, an easy thing to lose, and a hard thing to gain. Thanks for any suggestions.",finance,1415899628

My mortgage payment is paid automatically on the first of each month from my checking account, so I am never late and never forget.  I also have an extra $25 payment made automatically towards the principal on the first of each month.  I have heard that paying even this little bit extra each month can you save you several mortgage payments down the road.

My question:

I do not earn a ton of money (i am a public school teacher), but my wife and I live very frugally and live within our means.  My wife does babysitting and tutoring every now and then to earn a little bit of money, and I also earn a few extra bucks from miscellaneous things here and there.  Also, occasionally we have one or two hundred dollars extra left over in our budget if we under-spend over the course of a few months.

Is it a good idea to throw any and all extra monies we come upon or are able to earn at the principal of the mortgage?  I am talking about a few extra payments of anywhere in between $25 and $100 a month.  The sad reality is that if we don't put this towards the mortgage, we probably will not invest it or do anything else other than let it sit in the checking account.  In other words, will paying off even little amounts at a time be worth it in the end?  Or is it so nominal that it's not even worth it?",finance,1415904386

**Me**: 25, $60k salary (~$3500/mn take-home), $100k student loans from grad school (~$300/mn loan repayment), no other debt, probably not able to do full reno work but can fix most things

**Her**: 26, Grad student w/ 2 years before making money and end of deferral, will end with ~$120k student loans, no other debt, negligible income currently, will make ~$30-60k after graduation and internship.

**Current Apartment**: $600/mn rent, $75/mn utilities, 1 bedroom (just us), 700-sq ft, neighbors are fine (but we're not friends)

**Prospective House**: Looking for houses in ~$75k-150k range, can probably get preapproval for $200k if desired (but don't want that much), will have 20% down (ie, no PMI)

We're looking to potentially move into a starter-type house in Greenwood, IN (south of Indianapolis). I see little reason to continue renting when we're planning on staying here and have most other expenses figured out (student loan repayment plan being the primary concern). Rent vs buy calculators tend to agree with that assessment. It really doesn't make much sense to me to continue paying into a rent instead of paying into home equity. The better half is concerned we're overlooking things however and wanted more input.

I am scared and I am not even remotely prepared to pay this, and before I start working on making a payment plan with the IRS (or researching which type of rope is best for noose construction) I'd like to present my problem to the public. I plan on hiring the help of a tax professional to work things over with me, but posting here and getting some feedback is my first and reluctant step at working on this issue.  
  
Set up: when I was born, my grandparents deposited $10,000 in to a Vanguard UGMA (United Gift to Minors) account. In February of 2014, the total balance of this account was $64000.

From January 2014 to May 15 of 2014, I worked one job and earned $4200 as gross pay and paid $900 in federal taxes. From June 1 until present of 2014, I worked a second job. I will likely work this job until December 31, and my anticipated gross pay for 2014 will be $26500. My anticipated federal income tax deductions will be $3100.  
  
In February of 2014 I itched to cash out Vanguard UGMA after having recovered entirely and then some from the 2008 financial crisis. So I did, and I had $64000 in my checking account. I lived $8000 worth of foolish lifestyle inflation, and then I paid my student loans in their entirety at cost of $58000. $6000 of this $58000 was to student loan interest, but to simplify our numbers here let us neglect this interest paid.  
  
Then my gross pay from both jobs was $30700 for this year, but the income from the UGMA puts me at $95000 taxable income for 2014. From this taxable income, I have paid $4000 in federal income tax. As I said earlier, rough IRS tax calculator work estimates that my tax burden is $16000. As I have paid $4000 already, I will owe $12000. This does not make me feel better. I now realize that I did a foolish thing by cashing out my entire UGMA all at once and even more foolishly living that lifestyle inflation, but this has all given me a valuable lesson in tax burdens and frugality.

personalfinance,"Hi PF, I've listened to you guys and have done everything ""right"" for almost 3 years...now what?","Husband and I finished grad school in late 2011. We left grad school with 

* 65k combined Federal Student Loan (SL) debt with interest rates varying on our loans from 1.5-6.55%

* 14k Auto Loan at 3.5 %

* 8k credit card debt at 18%

After three years we have substantially reduced our debt; 9 mos ago I also landed a very good job in my field. I have paid attention to this sub and have done everything ""right"", and we have been lucky too. My husband is currently making a bit over 60k and after the new year my salary will be over 80k. Credit cards, auto loan and high interest Student Loans have been paid in-full. We are currently living off of my income and applying 100% of his monthly take-home income (~3500$) to what is left on our Federal Student Loans. Today I realized that in a few months we will have paid them off...I've been so focused on escaping them that I have not thought much further. I'm not sure what we will do with his salary. 

We already

* Have a sufficient emergency fund

* Maximize contributions to 403(b) and 401(k) accounts for matching

* Own a home (owed 119k @ 4.25%), which we bought at the absolute bottom of the housing crash in our area (mortgage payment is significantly less then rent here...university town) and have about 30k equity in it. 

* Recently Opened a Roth IRA with some wedding gift funds, which will will contribute the maximum to as soon as our SL are paid off. 

We are accustom to comfortably living on my salary alone; I don't want to change that. What is the most sensible thing to do with my husband's salary? Should we pay off our home? Should we start investing? If we should invest, where do we start (we both have very demanding jobs, and probably can't spend a lot of time educating ourselves on this topic which we know nothing about...) We have no plans for children.

My real question is, how should I budget savings/paying down student loan/enjoying life a bit?

My car is fully paid off, but gas is a killer. I'm living with my parents to save on rent for now, but sacrificing with a 60 mile commute roundtrip. Gas comes out to around $80/week. 

My company pays for lunch and parking so that's pretty sweet.

Now, my student loan is $110,000. I know that's quite a large amount for undergrad, but I had no financial aid and had to pay for textbooks and rent.

My biweekly pay is about $1600. My company matches 50% up to 7%, so I'm contributing the full 7% for now.

Bitcoin,0 in Share . Bitcoin Former Federal Reserve Bank Examiner Mark T. Williams: Bitcorn Says Bitcoin May Attack Sovereignty,"Former Federal Reserve Bank Examiner Mark T. Williams believes that if adopted in its current raw form, Bitcoin has the potential to undermine the longstanding bond between sovereign and its currency. His statement came when he was presenting his views on Bitcoin’s sovereign attack risk at the World Bank Conference.

This though is not a new issue as Bitcoin has long been considered a challenge for the State and its sovereignty to issue currency. However, as the point has been presented by the former Federal Reserve Bank Examiner, it has been taken into perspective. Williams seems to be concerned with how Bitcoin manages its own monetary base in a decentralized manner.

According to Federal Reserve Bank Examiner controlling the monetary base is an immense power and responsibility that is put into the hands of those who create the algorithm, protocol, manage the transactional ledger and mine virtual currencies. However, when this is given to non-State elements, there is heavy risk for sovereignty.

Williams says that governments and central banks are needed to provide economic stability for their citizens. According to him governments exercise a monopoly power on currency creation with the understanding that doing so will provide its citizens with a greater level of economic stability. Bitcoin can generate instability not just for citizens but for the country.

He also says that if Bitcoin were allowed to co-exist as ‘legal tender’ it could also create a situation where under Gresham’s Law ‘Bad money drives out good.’ According to him in such a scenario, bad currency i.e. Bitcoin would be used and good currency i.e. US dollar would be hoarded, creating greater economic instability.

Asks for International Oversight on Bitcoin

Though he believe that Bitcoin is an example of new technology that has clear promise, it also poses a multitude of risks to consumers, companies and sovereigns. According to him Bitcoin and its delivery system cannot be separated. The strength or weakness of the system is linked to Bitcoin the currency (engine) and Bitcoin the delivery platform (rails).

Williams adds that no matter how sturdy the rails, if the engine is not sound due to extreme market volatility, or artificial scarcity, the system cannot function at reliable and safe levels.

He suggests that to counteract the panoply of risks associated with virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, there needs to be greater regulation, international oversight, sovereign control and stronger consumer protection rules put firmly in place.",cryptocurrency,1415914423

A little background: I have a degree in International Business/Economics. I graduated in Dec 2011, Accepted a job to teach English in Europe for the 2012/2013 school year. Fell for European girl. Moved back to Texas in July/2013 with $5 in my bank account. Worked parttime while job hunting. My car broke down, put $1200 on a credit card to fix it. It broke down again, another $800. I forgot to delay a student loan, so they called collecting. When I finally received a Job as a Marketing Research Analyst making $45,000/year last Fall, I was $7,000 in debt. I paid all that off and the small student loan off in 4 month. That does not include the debt I had delayed, which are the rest of my student loans. After a year of working, my employer asked me to take a Graduate Certification Class. Cost is $3,900. They will pay for $3,000. I will pay the remaining $900. I will be visiting the GF at the beginning of the year. The trip to Europe, combined with the graduate program, my savings is depleted,

I need some help with a strategy. I do not want to be paying off my debt for the next 10 years. I want to pay them off ASAP. I want to have a little more breathing room incase I do want to marry this European girl. Right now, We couldnt afford that. I learned today I will receive a $750 bonus for the holidays. That will go to the CC debt. I will pay the rest off by the end of the year. So I will be at a fresh start in 2015.

The Plan:
1) I am wondering, Should I consolidate my debt, the Sallie Mae Loans, and the NelNet loans and extend them out for 20-25 years. With the savings on the Student Loan monthly Payments, I would then use that money to attack a single loans principle until its paid off.

2) Using my Tax return to pay off one of the smaller ones. Saving me $20-30/month and rolling that into paying the principle on another loan.

3) I feel like my Interest Rate is extremely high on my Car loan. How do I go about Refinancing those?

4) What can I have my dad do to lower the payment on the Parent Plus?

5) Should I drop my 401K contributions from 14% to a lower %, and using that extra money on student loans? My Employer does not offer a match. They offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, at a 5% discount. Do I need to take advantage of that?

So what has happened with 0% interest rates? Well we have funded a huge amount of shale oil plays junk bonds and MLP's (high yield debt) to fund these plays. Well these all were based on oil at $100 a barrel... 

But the problem with this, the issue we have and why it's a bubble is this debt was based off of artificial interest rates and thus miss-priced. 

We now today have a ton of debt out there for things like oil plays that are starting to get very scary with oil here. What happens if oil goes to $60? 

Do you know how much debt there is in these things? Oil is crashing... We are going to get retail numbers tomorrow. They might be good but if they aren't people are going to flip out as the thesis is low oil = good consumer sales.

personalfinance,"Make sure you know if your retirement accounts are ERISA compliant or not. SIMPLE IRAs and SEPs are booby trapped by lack of anti-alienation protection, and you can lose them if you're sued in state court.","http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2006/jan/protectretirementassets

ERISA accounts lose their protection in state court, and while most of them are protected by the anti-alienation clause, SIMPLE IRAs and SEP accounts don't have it.

Relevant scenario from the link:

As an example, Mark Smith is a small business owner who has $500,000 invested in a SEP IRA established by his company. Under his state’s law, assets held in an IRA generally are exempted from any creditor claims. Mark is successfully sued for $300,000 of damages in state court and is not filing for federal bankruptcy protection.

This matter is outside of federal bankruptcy law, and the new bankruptcy protections therefore do not apply. Because Mark’s money is in a SEP IRA, it constitutes an ERISA pension plan, preempting any state law directly protecting it, and it would not qualify for the antialienation protections usually afforded ERISA plans. The judgment creditor therefore may successfully attach Mark’s IRA.

If Mark transferred the money in his SEP IRA to a rollover IRA, it no longer would qualify as an ERISA pension plan. Thus it would be protected from creditor claims up to $1 million either inside a bankruptcy proceeding or possibly to an unlimited extent outside of bankruptcy under applicable state law.",finance,1415939620

My MIL is in the final stage of a long, degenerative illness. I don't expect her to make it through the weekend. She has been in an care facility here in PA for the last two and a half years. The facility is one of those ""sell your house, move into our nice condo"" deals. But when her condition became too advanced, she moved into their nursing home and finally, for the last seven months, hospice. As per her advance directive, following a very bad fall, all medical care was stopped and they were simply making her comfortable with medication.

I am terrified because we live in PA, which has filial responsibilty laws. My husband, his brother (who lives in CA) and his sister (also PA) could potentially be on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars. I do not know if they would be, because I have no idea what kind of contract my MIL signed with the care facility. I was told (through my huband, via his sister) that because she basically gave the nursing home (owned by the Lutherans) a pile of money with the sale of her house, that would cover the cost of her care, regardless of what came after. I have a hard time believing this, quite frankly.

I know my MIL had investments, there was life insurance following my FIL's death. How much of that is eaten up, I don't know. My husband and his sister (who has POA, his brother is the executor of the estate) have been on terrible terms since all this began (all her fault. My hubby has done nothing to deserve the treatment he's gotten, but that's a different story.)

We have a new baby. And while we both have worked very hard to have 800+ credit scores, a home with a rock-bottom mortgage and amazing interest rate, $25,000 in emergency savings, $20,000 in my 401K, two paid-off cars and no debt of our own, our money barely covers our own expenses. Daycare is so expensive, my parents have started helping us out there.

There is no freaking way we could handle 100,000+, or even 30 grand worth of debt that we did not incur. PA's laws basically say the adult children are perpetually responsible for the bills their parents incur and can be pursued after death. There is no mandate that children be apprised of these debts as they are incurred, either. It's basically ""Hey, you owe us 90 grand. Pay up or we sue and destroy your credit!"" I have no idea if there will be an estate, though I can't imagine there will be. It also seems that the state cherry picks the one they go after. Honestly, my sister and brother-in law out earn the both of us 2 to 1. But my husband was the one visiting his mom every single (and I mean every single solitary weekend for the last two years) weekend, they know us. 

I've asked my husband many times to please, please, please get a real understanding of where his mother stands financially and now, what responsibility may fall on us when she dies. So far, he's given it the ""well, we'll see."" 

And, of course, as the in-law, I have absolutley no say or right to any information. PF, what can I do to protect ourselves? Like I said, I have no way of knowing if this is actually going to come to pass, but since I have zero information, I have to assume the worst.",finance,1415970717

[I made a post yesterday in student loans](http://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/2m6nwe/can_it_be_bad_to_pay_more_than_the_minimum/) regarding a student loan I have that has a 0% interest rate. Currently have $24,500 remaining on the loan to be paid off in 20 years with a $146 monthly payment.

I wanted to put extra money towards the loan each month (an additional $350 on top of the minimum payment for a total of $500 a month). Someone in the thread mentioned that, since I have no interest to pay, I should put that extra money into a savings that accrues interest. I like this idea. However, I currently bank with Chase and their savings account interest rate is measly 0.01% 

I have $3200 in an emergency fund that I'd like to be able to access at a moment's notice shall I run into said emergency. I would ideally like to open a savings with an initial deposit of $500 that has a reasonable interest rate. After that, each month I would put the additional $350 into the savings that I would have put towards the loan. Again, this loan is a 0% interest loan, so instead of simply knocking down the debt at a faster rate I'll be able to start building a separate savings account that accrues interest at a much higher rate than my current Chase savings. 

Is this a sound idea? Is this possible? Instead of throwing money at a loan that will never increase in payments unless I'm very late on payments, I put that extra money into a different account? Are there resources available that will allow me to start with an initial small deposit and offer a high interest rate? Should I just throw the money at the loan to get it off of my name? Your thoughts?

I'm not in a financial crutch at the moment. I can afford upping the payments. I have no other debts.

personalfinance,"We're young and got lucky with money. Right now it's in low interest savings, and we're considering investing.","So, a few key details here:

- My husband already contributes to his 401K through his employer. 
- We already have an emergency fund of $5,000 (though we want it to be bigger, circumstances like our 5 month old son, dental problems, etc keep bringing that down to about $4,500 or so. Those funds are separate from the money I'm talking about investing in this post.
- Both of our cars are completely paid off, and we do not have any outstanding debt in student loans, payday loans, and we always pay off our credit card immediately (within 2 weeks) but we do have one hospital bill from when I delivered our son in June. We will have paid off this debt by February 2016 by making $100 payments every month. 
- We bought a townhome almost a year ago. Mortgage payment is $890/month on a $162,000 loan with an interest rate below 5% - this is our only ""debt""
- I am not employed. I am a stay at home mom.
- **YES, I did read the ""I have $X, What do I do with it?!"" post! I'm now considering a Roth IRA, but we have quite a bit more than $5,500 to invest. Now it's time to get more specific!**

Okay. So. Last summer, my husband participated in a contest and won quite a huge chunk of money. I think in total he walked away with $84,000. A lot of that money went to taxes, I think we put about 20-25% into the down payment on our townhome, some went to our wedding last fall, and our honeymoon, some went to buying a nice TV and a nice bed, furnishings for our house, and now we have $20,000 in a CD at our local credit union.

The CD expires next June, and we're pondering what to do with it. We've talked about putting about $10,000 into stocks/bonds, and after some investigation by me this morning, I think a Roth IRA would be responsible as well. We talked to my sister in law about short and long term goals, and I know that plays an important role in what we ultimately decide to do with our money... but I don't know HOW to actually get from where we are now TO those long term goals.

- Short term: We hope to have multiple children, and we will probably need to move into a larger home within the next 10 years. I would love to have a big house and a big back yard. A 4-5 bedroom house with a big backyard would probably cost about $250,000-300,000 in Utah where we live.

- Short term: My husband would LOVE to buy a nice car. He realistically knows other things take a big priority (like, our kids being able to go to college someday) but if we got really lucky somehow in the stock market, he would probably want to buy an EVO at about $42,000. We've decided that won't really happen unless his career starts paying him more. It's a goal, but not a high priority one.

- Long term: Husband being able to retire early is something I'd like to consider. 

- Long term: We would like to provide for our families in the event of an untimely death. We're already kind of taking care of this and we felt strongly that life insurance was very important. We've got about 300-400K life insurance policies on each of us, costing us about $80/month. We're basically set there, but if we can leave more to divide amongst our children and provide for them if they're under 18 and left with other family members, we don't want expenses to be any kind of a burden. 

--------

So yeah. That's basically where we are at. We have a house ($162K), we have a son (5 months old) and we plan to try for about 3-5 kids, we already have an emergency fund (and I plan to make that bigger once our CD expires), both cars are paid off and in great working condition, and beyond our mortgage, our only debt is a hospital bill.

**So what do we want to do with our $20,000 when the 1-year CD expires June 2015?**

- Roth IRA = $5,500
- Bigger emergency fund = $4,500 (to make our existing one about $10K)

**That leaves us with about $10,000 free to invest in stocks/bonds... But considering our short term goal of buying a bigger house in the next 10 years, would it be unwise to put all $10,000 in stocks/bonds?**

I'm a total n00b when it comes to all this stuff and I feel a responsibility to learn. I'm gonna go do some more research (like, *what is a feduciary*, for example) and try to have some information to show my husband so we can start making a plan NOW.",finance,1415990004

personalfinance,I do not know where to go from here,"Hi everyone. This is a continuation from the MIL dying thread, for those who asked for my expenses so see if they could help. I am going to throw myself on my sword before I get started. My husband smokes and he eats at least two, sometimes three meals out every work day. There is nothing I can do to change this behavior. In spite of the fact that he is a wonderful, caring, attentive and considerate husband, who cooks, cleans and cares for our kid in equal measure, he flat-out refuses to quit smoking or carry his lunch/dinner. I carry my breakfast lunch and (if necessary) dinner and my daughter's breakfast and lunch and only get to go out to eat when someone else is paying the bills. He also refuses to find another job because he wants to keep doing what he's doing, in spite of the fact it costs us about a thousand dollars a month for him to keep a job that pays him 800. 

I have tried everything to get him to quit, from calm conversation to threats and screaming. The same goes for the eating out. We just had a major fight about it two weekends ago. Honestly, I'm out of options. If you've got better suggestions, I'm all ears. Details below.

Me: Business professional, 36, 55K/yr $1428 take home every two weeks (includes deductions for health/dental/eye insurance [I cover all of us] and my maxed 401K contribution)
Him: Newspaper photographer, 44, 28K/yr $800 every two weeks (his health/dental/eye insurance is taken out, but we will be dropping it this year and just keeping my plan)

We have one home we bought four years ago for $189K with 20 percent down. We have two paid-for cars (five years old and eight years old) and $20,000 in my 401K. His work stopped offering a 401k three years ago and his subequently has about $2,000 in it. We have $25,000 in emergency fund savings ($15,000 for home-related emergencies, $10,000 for general emergency), a liquid account that has about $3,000-$3,500 in it (earmarked for mortage and CC bill. This month, at the end of the month, we had $900 in there after paying both), plus my account (usually end up with a few dollars left over at the end of the month) and his (taking anywhere from $60 to $100 out of the joint to go into his account)

Mortgage, home owners and taxes (all one payment): $1,075/mo (we refied about 18 mo ago and have a 3.5 percent interest rate)

Car insurance (both vehicles): $118 (he has shitty Safe Auto, I have a pretty decent policy)

Daycare: $972/month (it is a literal two minute walk from my office. At $243 a week, this is the midpoint of childcare costs in my area. Any lower, and you're talking shoddy facilities in low-income areas with low state ratings. The two other acceptable facilities with slightly cheaper rates ($200/week) have a two-year-long wait list. We are on both and have still not been called. Higher costs are places like KinderKare, Goddard, etc. Private care is equivalent cost.)

Heating oil: $266/month (budget payment plan with price cap, no option to switch to natural gas, the lines don't run out to our part of the county)

Cable (two TVs, downstairs and our bedroom) and high-speed internet: $145 (just threatened/negotiated with comcast for a locked in one-year rate with free DVR and all-free movie channels. This is our main source of entertainment. Internet is essential because both of us have to be able to work from home at a moment's notice)

Cell phones (two smart phones, requirements for both of our jobs. Not an option to downgrade phones or data plan. My husband's job requires him to shoot video/upload from the field to all SM sites the paper owns, etc. and my job requires constant ability to be in contact and mobile. They used to give him $25 for the cell phone, but they stopped that about a year ago): $185 on Verizon (discounted 18 percent through my employer).

Electric: varies between $143 to $220 a month, depending on usage. We just switched to a cheaper electric providers as our rates hiked here in PA. These are the new rates.

Food: $400 per month including diapers and stuff for the kid (I have been shopping at the local bend and dent and recently got this number down to about $300)

Garbage: $13/month, billed quarterly

Gasoline (my car): $192 (filling up four times a month, 16 gallons at current $3/gal rate)

Credit Card (paid in full every month): 900-1500 (includes my husband's gas for his car and all his meals out). His job requires him to drive at a moment's notice anywhere in a five county area, with occassional trips farther based on stories. He gets a whopping 28 cents a mile for his trouble. It also includes the $50/month perscription he has for his chronic blood condition. 

There are still copays at the doctor's, out-of-pocket co-insurace (my ins for the coming year has a cap of $4800 max out of pocket for a family) prescriptions for the kid and myself when we get sick, various fees associated with daycare, getting our taxes done each year, oil changes for both cars, etc. 

My parents give us $900 a month. I cannot tell you how sick this makes me. Until we had the kid and the daycare costs started killing us, we were banking $500 a month by saving what we would have paid in car payments. I didn't ask. My parents just gave it to me. They are very, very well off financially and are not hurting by giving me this money. And I know they don't want me to feel bad about it, but I do. I feel so frustrated that I cannot make my husband see that his stupid job, which he is absolutely, 100 percent wonderful at, is going to end up putting us in the poor house. I got out of journalism for exactly this reason. I realized that I could never have the life we both wanted if I stayed. And I love my husband dearly, so please, no one suggest divorce. This is not one of those situations. He is a great guy. It's just these things. I am certain there is a way through this, I just can't see it. 

I am just absolutely befuddled why he needs to stay at the paper and take the abuse (I could start a whole other thread on the abusive working conditions he endures, including mandatory unpaid overtime (he left early today because his mom is dying after working 13, 8-to- 10-hour days straight) and boss who refuses to let him take sick days or set a schedule that isn't dictated by the man's whims and side-business committments.) My husband has virtually no gear of his own and everything he owns is either broken or held together with gaffers tape. Six years ago, we had to actually buy him a camera or he wouldn't have had a job come Monday. Thank god it lasted as long as it did because the paper finally sprang for a new one a year and a half ago. My husband was named the state's top photographer two years ago, but the market in our region is flooded with photogs and momographers who think a fancy camera set to autofocus and a website makes them a photographer. Everyone wants free and/or cheap sessions or thinks their PR team with a camera is good enough. The major metro daily laid off about four photogs last year. He also doesn't believe he has any other option beyond being a photographer because he has no college degree. It's either that or Walmart, or being a truck driver. I really don't believe that, but he does.

personalfinance,"Fiancee has 80k in private Discover student loans, 20k in federal loans. Need advice.","Here's the situation. My fiancee finished school with a BA in psychology and criminal justice in May, and has a combined 100k in debt, 20k in federal loans, and 80k in private loans with Discover. To my knowledge there are 3 Discover loans, one with an 11% interest rate. These loans are all co-signed by fiancee's aging maternal grandmother.

I have a High School diploma, no debt, and 7 years of experience with design/layout work, and office work. I lost my (part time) job of many years just after fiancee graduated, due to budget cutbacks by the non-profit I had been working for.

We have spent the entire summer since she graduated living on the generosity of friends, and looking for work. I have had multiple interviews but am still currently unemployed and looking for work, any kind of work, at this point.

Fiancee has *just* managed to get a part time job with a security firm, and will be starting soon. The pay is $11/hr and we do not yet know how many hours she will be given, though the company has said that its supposedly easy to move from part time to full time. This is the good news. 

The bad news is that now the generosity of friends has run out, and Fiancee's part time job is what we will be living on. There is no option for either of us to live with our parents. We will *have* to get an apartment as soon as Fiancee's paychecks start coming in. I have scraped by living frugally on my own for all of my adult life with a $800/month budget, so that's not the problem. 

The problem is I have no idea how to do this with the addition of student loans, because I have no idea how student loans work. For the federal, I know those can be deferred, and repaid based on income, so I am not worried about them.

What I worry about is the 80k of private student loans, which go into repayment in December.
 Here are my questions.

**I have heard that these can not be discharged even with bankruptcy. Is this completely true?**

**If private student loans are refinanced, can they be discharged through bankruptcy?**

**Can loans be refinanced so that fiancee's grandmother is no longer responsible for the debt? Is there any way to remove a cosigner from a loan?**

**Is Discover likely to work with us so that we can make payments on the loan that we can afford, and not go into default, or is there a hard amount that we will absolutely have to pay no matter what?**

**What *really* happens if we go into default on private student loans because we legitimately are unable to pay them?**

My fiancee has already called Discover to discuss- however they will not talk about repayment options until her grace period is over, which is next week, apparently. In the meantime, I am trying to figure out all I can.

business,Considering Starting A Micro-Lending Online Company. Any Advice is Welcome!!,"Hi Everyone,

I am a finance major and have experience working in the financial services industry for the past 7 years.  Recently I had an idea to start a sort of social network that pairs personal lenders with borrowers.  I realize that sites like this already exist kiva.com etc. for business start-ups.  What I want to do is allow borrowers to request money for whatever situation they require (paying off school loans, college, credit card debt, a new computer etc.) and allow them to request borrowers who will provide them with a specific interest rate.  

The model I was considering using is $6.99 monthly membership to all lenders (lenders could be anyone, me, you or your neighbor it doesn't matter!) Borrowers do not pay a monthly membership, but each loan given is subject to a $.30 fee that our company will donate to various charities.  One borrower could retrieve micro-loans for hundreds of different lenders in order to reach their goal, and the minimum amount to borrow is $5.00.  I believe that having a social network and knowing that you are borrowing money from actual people, not large banks will encourage borrowers to make these payments. 

My question to you all is: - Where do I even begin here? What type of licenses would I require etc. and would I need to be bonded in order to start this company even though all money is peer-to-peer.

Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your support for net neutrality. It is good to hear from you.
 
As you may know, there is some controversy related to the amount of control broadband providers should have over a subscriber's access to the Internet. In 2004, the FCC proposed guidelines to keep the Internet open. These were not rules or regulations, merely proposed principles for Internet Service Providers. In 2008, the FCC attempted to enforce these principles against Comcast when they were accused of slowing down traffic for BitTorrent. The FCC would eventually censure Comcast. This led to a ruling on April 6, 2010 by the  DC Circuit Court of Appeals that held the FCC does not hold the authority to regulate cable Internet services under the broad policy goals contained in the Communications Act. In December 2010, then Chair of the FCC, Julius Genachowski , issued the ""open Internet"" rules. This was undertaken without direction or authorization from Congress.  In January 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court overturned those rules, but did say the FCC had the power to regulate the Internet. On May 15, the FCC released a revised proposal of rules to replace those struck down by the court. 
 
It may interest you to know, I supported H.R. 1, the Continuing Resolution that provided appropriations for  the fiscal year 2011. In that bill was an amendment that would prohibit the FCC from enforcing net neutrality rules. I also was a cosponsor to H.R. 96, the Internet Freedom Act in the last session of Congress which would also prohibit the FCC from enforcing these regulations. I believe issuing the net neutrality rules was an unconstitutional, unauthorized, and unprecedented move by the FCC to over-regulate a private industry.  Additionally, the rules infringe on an internet subscriber's constitutional right to free speech. This would patently change the telecommunications industry and negatively affect consumers by giving the federal government the authority to police the internet. As Congress considers other measures to prohibit the implementation of net neutrality, I will keep your thoughts in mind. Once again, thank you again for contacting me. Please do not hesitate to do so again in the future.

personalfinance,"Just graduated, bought a brand new car. FUCK. Any advice on how to tackle this + student loans?","Hey PF,

I’ve made some bad financial decisions in the past and I’m looking for a bit of advice. I graduated from college in May and got a job that pays $60,000 in addition to a $5,000 signing bonus too. 

I went to an expensive private college and have $120,000 in student loans. My parents said they’ll pay for most and I’d be responsible for $40,000. I’m in the software development field, which could pay much more as my career progresses. 

My job is in Westlake, Texas, but I’m currently in Raleigh, NC for training. I’m getting free rent, but I’ll be moving back in mid-December. So that’s when all my student loans and rent will be kicking in. 

For rent, my sister currently lives in East Dallas and would be willing to let me live with her and my brother-in-law for free. However, this would mean a 1+ hour commute every morning and evening. I ran some numbers and found that it would cost me about 3-4 gallons of gas every day for that commute, which would end up being about $200/month and adding ~2,000 miles to my car every month.

I have found some nice apartments close to the office for about $800, which would only be about 5 minutes away and much less money spent on gas.

I needed a car for work, and my dad said to start looking for cars below $25,000. I did and I found some decent ones I thought I could afford for about $22,000. Problem is, when we went to the Lexus dealership, my dad suggested that I test drive the new 2014 Lexus ES 350’s. I loved it compared to the other ones I was looking at, and my dad started talking to the salesman. Specifically, the model we looked at was at an MSRP of $44,000. He took over the negotiations and managed to get the price down to about $37,000. All during this time, I could’ve objected, but I didn’t, and he sat down with me and ran the numbers and said I could afford it. So we bought it. And it’s killing me.

I make about $3200 a month. I’ve made a budget on Mint that looks like this:

&gt; -	$800 student loans  
&gt; -	$800 rent  
&gt; -	$615 car payment  
&gt; -	$165 car insurance  
&gt; -	$150 shopping  
&gt; -	$100 fast food  
&gt; -	$100 groceries  
&gt; -	$80 gas  
&gt; -	$40 restaurants  
&gt; -	$20 gym  
&gt; -	$20 alcohol/bars  
&gt; -	$300 savings


I haven’t finalized any rent payments, so that number could fluctuate. Same with student loans; the minimum payment seems to be around $400, but I would like to pay them off fast. The interest rates range from 7.23 to 3.4 for those. The car payment interest rate is 3.79. Using unbury.me, if I stick to this budget I should be able to be debt-free by December 2019, when I’m 27.

I love my parents to death, but I think that they think I can afford a much more luxurious lifestyle than I can really sustain. These $800 car and insurance payments are killing me. I’ve talked to them and they offered to pay for some of the payments, but in January they’re all mine. I read that it’s possible to resell cars that you just bought, but the car has already lost so much value because it’s pre-owned. So I’m not sure what to do about that.

Another thing that I have, which is kind of silly, is a HUGE desire to move to Montreal. I’m starting to save up for it and I would love to be there ASAP. So I want to save more money than $300/month. I currently have $4,000 in my savings and would be projected to have about $10,000 by the time July 2016 rolls around, which is when I turn 24, which I think would be fine. But if I could go there sooner that would be amazing…

So basically, I would love a critique of my budget. I want to know what I’m doing right and what I’m doing wrong. Should I sell my car? Should I live with my sister? Is Montreal realistic for me? ANY advice is appreciated!

financialindependence,401k or Taxable FIRE account for ER @ 50 (no employer match),"Looking for input on how to evaluate whether it'd be better to contribute my annual $17.5k ($18k in 2015) to a 401k, or to a Taxable FIRE account. What makes it more complicated is that I have NO company match at my new job and my retirement is planned for many years before federal retirement age. If I had a company match I would definitely contribute to 401k up to the match limit. I'll likely have a 401k match at some point again before I'm 50, but not this this year.

Couple things worth noting:   
* **edit** Vanguard 401k provider  
* No company match.  
* I'm 31 and on track to retire @ 50  
* Currently have $200k in 401k, and $180k in Taxable FIRE account.  
* In addition to the annual $17.5k I'm looking for guidance on here,  I also contribute $4k/month to my taxable FIRE account to speed up early retirement.  
* I Don't contribute to any type of IRA because my income puts me in range where I receive no annual tax benefit.  
  
As I see it there are 2 paths that I'm looking for guidance on:  
  
1. Continue to put $17.5k in to Taxable FIRE account which I can withdraw from ""penalty-free"" at 50. Downside is that I have to pay income taxes on that money now, pay taxes on the dividends now, and then pay taxes on growth when I take out the money at 50+. Lot's a lot of taxes paid!  
  
2. Contribute to 401k and defer taxes until after retirement. But since I'm planning to retire at 50, that means I'll likely need to access some of this money early and therefore pay the 10% penalty.  
  
  
I know for MOST folks it never makes sense to take early withdrawals from 401k, but I'm wondering if for FIRE folks it can may make sense when retirement is ~50.

Also worth noting that my new employer offers a Roth 401k in addition to 401k.",finance,1416020535

personalfinance,Question about in-state tuition and working/residing in 2 states,"The 2 states I'm dealing with are TN and FL, both of which do not have state income tax.

I currently work in TN.  Starting January 2015, I'd like to officially become a resident of FL (get my driver's license, voter's registration, etc.) and I will own property there and pay property taxes.

However, I want to continue working in TN until July 2015.  (I will be flying back and forth for family.)  Beginning Fall 2015, I will enroll at a FL state school where I'd pay out-of-state tuition that semester.  When I enroll for Spring 2016, I'd like to obtain residency so I can pay in-state tuition.  

By this time, I'll be able to provide all the evidence for FL residency.  The school will want to see my 2015 federal tax return with an FL address (which I'll provide).  But I'm worried that my employment in TN will get me denied.  However, according to my most recent tax return there is no indication that I specifically worked in TN and my employer is a national company.  And as I said before, both states only require filing federal income tax.

I'd like to continue working in TN up until I enroll in college because I'm earning a decent income that will help me save for school.  But most importantly, I'd like to pay in-state tuition as soon as possible.

Does this seem like a feasible plan to get in-state tuition?",finance,1416020943

personalfinance,"Parents getting evicted, asking for money. Should I help out? Also, I'm really bad with money.","Long time lurker here. 
The story goes like this. I live in New Zealand, my parents are absolutely terrible with their money. In return I've picked up a lot of really bad habits. 

I don't know what my credit score is, but that is beside the point to the question I'm about to ask. 

My parents (living 6+ hours away) are getting evicted from their rental (they've got a really big, unsustainable house). They both don't have jobs and live off the government. They have lied to the government in order to get more money.

They waste (my opinion) a lot of money on things they don't actually need, even though they are living week by week. 

They owners of the house they are renting are coming back. They have 20 days left to move out. They don't have money to cover the costs of hiring cleaners to clean the house (no bond returned). 

They are quite unhealthy and it's actually physically impossible for them to do the necessary cleaning needed. They were told it's a no smoking house, yet she continues to smoke. Even though she had long cancer. But that is just something I personally think is stupid. 

They spend $100+ on smokes a week + $50 to $100+ on lotto tickets (complete waste of money that could be better served helping them save) (in my opinion).

Now comes to my part. They've asked me for as much money as I can give them. I'm living in a risk-free arrangement. I have a decent minimum wage job. Working 40+ hours a week. Makes me about $450 dollars a week after tax.

Part of my terrible habits I've obtained from my parents is that I like to squander my money away. On things I really do NOT need. 

My rent = $70 dollars a week.
I have a loan that I pay $68 dollars a week on. Interest rate is 15% for a $3,000 dollar loan. 

I also was given a credit card ($1000 dollar max) that I've already maxed out. I told myself not to do it, but they asked for some money and I had high hopes I could stop spending so much money on food every week.

I spend about $300 dollars a week on food. It's absolutely ridiculous. I know it. As of this week I'm buying all my food which has worked out to be about $80 dollars.

So my dilemma goes like this. 
I was going to use whatever I save from the next few weeks to knock off my credit card debt.

But my parents want about $500 dollars from me (which I KNOW they won't be able to pay back). 

I understand this, and it wouldn't be the WORST thing in the world, especially considering they need money for cleaners and a bond and a $300 dollar ""letting fee"" to move house. 

What should I do? I know I need to get my finances in check, not exactly sure how to. I know that the food that I buy is an easy solution to save a lot of money.

But if I give my parents the money, they don't risk being kicked out onto the street (but something tells me that they'll find a way to cope). I don't exactly have the best relationship with them, they've screwed me over so many times when it comes to money. And I always end up helping them. And our relationship has basically become a ""ring when I need money"" type of relationship. Usually $20-$40 dollars here and there.

So please, if anybody could give me some enlightenment on what I can or should do, I'd appreciate it.",finance,1416054538
personalfinance,I just want to thank this subreddit and my Mom,"Through motivation of this subreddit and my mom telling me I couldn't, I made my final student loan payment 6 months after my gradation date. Now to added some extra money towards retirement. :)



Edit: **How I paid them off**

I started school in 2010 and didn't start paying anything until summer of 2013. By January 2014 I racked up ~20k total loans. 

My junior year (2013) is when I decided I should start paying on them. 
Mint was a huge help in reminding me on how much I had left. 

I started worked 25 hours a week in the first half of 2013 and starting in the summer through graduation I worked 40 hours a week. This allowed me not to use any of my extra loan money for rent or other expenses. 

At the beginning of 2014 I decided to make huge payments to 2 of my 3 loans. Those added up to 10k with an high interest rate I no longer had to deal with. One was 4% and the other was 6.4% which had a majority of the balance. Managed to get down to 10k loans left at my graduation date with ~6k in savings.

For a couple months until I was certain to have a full time job I paid $100 per month. In June I started working full time. Not until August did I pay another large chunk of $4000 down. Basically from there on I put $1000+$100 a month to pay down the loans. I had a goal the whole time to pay my loans off by the end of my grace period. (I was already accusing interest because of later loans even though they were subsidized.) I was about a week late, but made the final payment 11/14/2014. My grade period ended 11/8/2014. I graduated on the 13th of May so close enough. :P

**Future Plans:**
Currently have ~3 months living expense. Going to get that up to 6 slowly, but going to at least double my IRA contribution. I have a 3% match and comes out to ~200 a month going into my IRA with match included. The company I work for just announced a 401k plan starting in January so I'll have to figure out how to transfer everything. 

My current plan is to break down my extra income to budget myself $200 for what ever I want. (Computer hardware / hiking stuff / other things not crucial for survival. $500 a month for e-fund and saving for a new car. The rest for my retirement which I think should be 500-$600 a month. I manage $1000-$1300 a month spare income. I work hourly at pre-tax income would be some where between 40-45k. I get overtime every week.

Luckily, I just paid off my student debt of $36,000 this year.  I make $64,500 and have no debt other than my 15-year mortgage payment of $1,075. I currently have 13 years remaining on a balance of $117,000.  

Currently, I have $10,000 in an emergency fund, $6,500 in savings, and $30,000 in a Roth IRA.  I put $350 per month in my Roth, and save $500 a month in my savings account. Furthermore, my university will offer me a pension when I retire of 75% of my highest five years worth of salary.  In addition, I have other teaching/consulting opportunities which usually give me an extra $5,000 per year.  

What do you think would be the best thing to do with my money/savings?

Some of my thoughts were:

1.  Max out my Roth IRA and forget about saving $500 per month (maybe only saving $400).

2.  Keep things status quo and increase my Roth IRA/savings as I earn raises over time

3.  Pay an extra $100 - $200 per month on my house payment so that I pay less interest and pay off the loan quicker (Currently, though, I have an unbelievable 2.5% interest rate).

4.  Put all money that I make outside of my salary into savings or on the house

personalfinance,Just got summoned to court for medical debt in collections,"Not sure what to do in this situation, so I'm hoping you all can help us figure out where to go from here. Back in April 2013, I went to the hospital and ended up racking up a $3k debt. There was more, but I paid off the other bills flat out ($500 here, $200 there). I didn't realize you can request payments, so I paid those in full... but when I got the $3k bill, I sluffed it off because I made about $400 a month and had (still have) no savings to pay it off in full. 

In July they sold my debt to a collector, and by September it was in collections. $3k is very overwhelming when you're 22 making minimum wage and in-between jobs, and I ignored every single piece of mail I got from any of them. After it hit my credit, I didn't even consider it debt anymore, as I'd just wait for the 7 years or w/e and let it fall off my credit. Or, as I just found out you can request to pay them less to have them take it off your account, so I was thinking of waiting a couple years then settling for less than I owe if possible.

Flawed, I know. Well, fast-forward a year and late two nights ago there's a knock on the door and my husband is served papers, summoning me to court over my unpaid collections. We have 20 days to respond. I have never dealt with anything like this before, but the timing can't be worse, just going into the holidays.

My husband called the number on the summons (we're supposed to call the next day), since I had to work through their business hours, and I guess they wanted us to just play along and be dumb, because they were very rude to him when he was trying to get information. He's in the Navy, so he mentioned we will be taking this to our JAG lawyer (or w/e it's called), and they pretty much told him ""No, no. No need to get lawyers involved. Just pay us the $3.2k"".

He called our insurance provider, since I am covered now, and asked if there was anything they could do to help us. The guy he was talking to looked up my info and said I did have coverage from another provider during the time I was seen back in 2013, and we needed to call the hospital and have them send a claim to TriCare, so they can contact the other provider.

After we called the hospital and looped around a few departments, we were told all they can do is send us an itemized list of the bill, since it isn't their account anymore. We called Tricare back, and the lady on the phone this time said there wasn't anything in the system for me except tricare so she doesn't know what my husband was talking about, was very snippy and blah blah we cant do anything outside our provider. I'm honestly not sure if I had coverage or not at the time. If I did it would have been something from the state.

So, my husband will be talking to his Chief on Monday, and getting with a lawyer as soon as possible, but I'm concerned because I don't speak lawyer. I don't make much money at my job - it all goes towards bills, gas, and home necessities as is. We don't have $3.2k sitting around to pay this off. We're already trying to tackle our massive debts and shape our spending habits, especially since we just found out I'm pregnant last month and the last thing I need is more stress.

personalfinance,Freelance - better to be classified as an independent contractor or employee?,"Hi there,

I work as a freelancer in New York City. I am a sole proprietor. No LLC or s-corp. By all logical measures I am an independent contractor. I keep my own hours, do not use client equipment, work from my home office, and receive only a request for finished product and no exact instructions from client.

I am almost always classified as an independent contractor (box 7 'Nonemployee compensation' on the 1099-MISC form.)

Every once in a while an employer will classify me as an employee instead (usually for vague workers comp legal concerns) and request a time sheet and W4 withholdings allowance worksheet info. While this is technically incorrect, I only care so far as to how this effects my tax rate.

So my question is - does this negatively effect my taxes in any way? The withholding percentage the last time this happened was about 40% of the invoice which struck me as very high considering that my total tax rate (Fed + State/City) after all business expenses is usually more like 25-30%.

Please forgive my ignorance on the matter. I just can't seem to wrap my head around how this will all boil down in the tax math later. I know that if they withheld too much it'll be compensated for; but I don't know if this money goes through a different ""channel"" in my tax workbooks and therefore won't benefit from my business expense deductions and will end up being taxed at a higher rate, or something like that.

Just getting started, any flaws in my plan?","I recently graduated from college and am trying to make sure I avoid financially expensive mistakes as I am starting things out. I’ve been lurking on pf for a few months now and I really have appreciated the great discussion I’ve found here. After reading the pf FAQ and taking stock of my situation, I came up with the below plan. Please let me know if you see any flaws, something I haven't considered, or have other recommendations.

**Current Situation**:

Salary: $66,000 (gross)

Checking: $500

Savings: $6000 (Only earns 0.06%, I will want to put this somewhere else in the future)

Student Loans: (All fixed rate, grace periods end on March 1st)

Current Monthly Spending: 

Amount|Category

**Assets**:
Just found out (earlier this week) that my parents set me up with an investment fund when I was a child. Apparently I have $5,200 with Voya in the Voya Core Equity Research Fund-Class I. I have not looked into this much at all and plan on leaving it where it is for the time being.

**Other Details**: 

No other debt. Most of my spending is done on CC and I pay the balance each month. Money in savings is intended as an emergency fund, but I am tempted to use half of it to knock out student loan debt faster. Given my expenses, I think my emergency fund is slightly oversized. 
I become eligible for the company 401k plan in mid-March and intend to get the 5% match. 

**The Plan**:

I will starting paying off the student loans as rapidly as possible using the ~$3000/month surplus income I currently have. I will start with the highest interest rate loans and work my way down until only the 3.4% loans remain. These I will just pay minimums on, since I believe I can earn more by investing the money. From my understanding I will also benefit from this because it gives me a long-history item to benefit my credit score.

Once I am eligible for my company’s 401k, I will contribute up to the 5% match. Eventually I want to open a Roth IRA, which I was planning on doing with Vanguard. Is there any benefit to doing this before the end of the year so that I can make contributions for both this year and next? 

Long term I intend to purchase a nicer used car in the next few years and I will probably move to cut down my commute but will have a higher rent as a result (I am willing to trade the $ for my time). Currently I am on my parents insurance and I just pay them my share, but I will have to get a separate plan once I am 26. I have not decided whether I will rent or just get my own place. I will most likely get a small foreclosed home close to my place of employment if I decide to go that route.

personalfinance,Networking in college and being successful while young.,"I am a long time reader, and I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit so feel free to point me in the right direction if it is.

Some background: 
I am a freshman at a well known private college in my area. I graduated high school early at 17 and moved across the country to get started with my life. I am a finance major and I not only dream big, but I act it as well. I would like to see myself with a good job, and good connections within the next year. I feel like if I am not successful in my life than to me it is a waste. I only want to be financially free and happy, and I see money as the gateway to that. My entire life I have seen my family members dream without acting, I have been held back by my age and family limitations. My family has ""failed"" all around me and I want to break free from their cycle. I am the first person in my family to go to college right out of high school and I want to be different. Now that I am on my own and free I want to achieve what I've always wanted. 

Now:
Recently I have become more and more fed up with how things are going in my life. I live in a dormitory and I am not like everyone around me who just wants to party and smoke all day. I want to go and grind. Which I have been. In my city there are multiple car dealerships owned by the same family, I have for some reason been extremely interested in them and wanted to work in these dealerships in some way (hopefully finance related). Recently I went into a high end clothing store just to look originally and I started talking to the person working at the time for a while. She could tell I was interested in the store and brand (I really am!) and we ended up talking about how it is like to work there and she told me that the owners of the car dealerships that I am interested in own the store. She suggested I email her supervisor about openings, so I did. I mentioned my interest in an internship or position and my interest in the store in general. She emailed back a few days later and said that the owner of the store(and local luxury car dealership) was on a vacation and that she would ask him about internships when he returned(early next week). She also said she would like to meet me in person and that there are no positions now, but that the future is always open. This got me extremely motivated and thinking about the future. This is where I have been recently thinking about how I do not want to do the typical college life recently. I want to have a kickstarted career and also finish my degree at the same time. 
Another connection I had recently was when I was taking lyft recently to an event I was talking with the driver and she was extremely nice. On the way back my girlfriend and I ended up requesting her again and we were talking about careers and I said I was looking for internships pretty hard, especially at car dealerships. She said that she worked with the owner of a very successful parent company who happens to own a bunch of car dealerships in this area as well and she said she would mention what we talked about to her the next time she saw her and I gave her my name and email to pass on as she requested. 

Part of me feels like I have some opportunities of a lifetime that I cannot pass up, and another part of me feels like I am overreacting everything because I am pretty fed up with how things are going in my life right now. I have always been high energy and about getting things done. 

I didn't just come here to rant/brag/or tell a story. I came here because I want to know if any other college students feel the same way as I do, if anyone has had any opportunities like this and what they did with them, and if you guys even think this is really anything. I really need other peoples input even though there isn't one direct question. I feel this is personal finance related because a big part of being successful and having a career is loving what you do and making connections. I feel like I have these connections that could open doors to doing something that I love. So mods, please let this stay or point me in another direction. If you made it this far thank you for sticking with my as I frantically wrote this out on the spot.

personalfinance,Can You Make Daily Payments on Student Loans?,"Hey all,

This morning--while I was eating a bowl of Cookie Crisp and watching cartoons like the post-grad that I am--I had a thought regarding my student loans (which will soon enter repayment in January).  Basically, if interest accrues daily on the loans, can I make daily payments to reduce the payback period and total interest paid?

A few notes about my loans (and the Excel analysis I did this morning):

- I have 6 loans. For my Excel experiment, I lumped them all together to make things simpler.  The total principal is $31,000 and the outstanding interest on January 1, 2015 will be $6,665.16.  2 of the loans have an interest rate of 6.0%, the others are at 6.8% (to be safe I assumed this was one loan of 31,000 with an interest rate of 6.8%).
- My standard monthly payment will be $434.08 beginning on 01/16/2015
- I assume that 100% of my payments go towards fees/interest before I can touch the principal (if I make the minimum payment)

Alright, so I thought I would compare three separate payment schemes:

1. Plan A: Make the standard (minimum) monthly payment ($434.08) just like normal
2. Plan B: Make daily payments of $14.47 (434.08 / 30)
3. Plan C: Make daily payments of $15.00 (to see the effect of a slight increase in payment rate

After toying with it for a while, I came up with this graph: http://i.imgur.com/gGS5E5n.png  (Edit: Data points were plotted daily...hence the stair-step in the monthly line)

Some numbers for comparison


Payment Scheme | Payoff Date | Interest Paid | % Interest Saved | % Total Saved
---|---|----|----|----
Monthly | 01/16/2025 | 20,223.37 | - | -
Daily ($14.47) | 08/02/2024 | $19,658.71 | 2.792% | 1.102%
Daily ($15.00) | 06/17/2024 | $19,380.96 | 4.166% | 1.645%

So (it appears to me) to at least be a feasible option on paper.  Obviously the mechanics and logistics are a little bit messier--it also assumes my budget can stand a payment every day from a cash flow perspective.

So a couple of questions:

1. I've seen some similar posts on some other subreddits where some people indicate that their ""back of the envelope math"" shows minimal savings.  While my results aren't very significant in my scenario (~$560 over the course of 9+ years isn't that big of a deal), it's definitely nothing to scoff at if you had significantly larger student loans. Is this too much work/too crazy to be worth the small results?
2. Is this even allowed (my bank allows it, but I have no idea about Navient)

personalfinance,Mizzou is refusing to release my transcript,"I'm not sure if this post belongs here, but it seems to be the most appropriate place so here goes nothing...

I was a student attending the University of Missouri-Columbia from 2008 through 2011.  I was emancipated from my parents, therefore I was independent as far as taxes/fafsa are concerned.  Because of this, I was receiving a generous Pell grant and all the student loans I needed.  There was some sort of federal law that changed causing me to lose my independent status because I wasn't emancipated before age 18 and was not yet 24.  Due to this change, I lost my Pell grant.  I couldn't make the payments for one particular semester, so the university did an admistrative withdrawal from all my classes.

Now fast forward to today.  I'm 24 and I'm in a position in my life where I can afford going back to school.  I contact the university and they tell me that I owe $6,000 from that semester I was withdrawn despite not receiving credit.  A large portion of this balance is accumulated late fees and interest.  It doesn't make sense to me that I'm being charged for classes even though I was withdrawn.  I went through a lengthy appeals process which got me absolutely nowhere.  I decided to just apply at another college in town rather than continue at the university.  

Now Mizzou is refusing to release my transcript because of the past due balance.  I'm not trying to show proof of classes I never paid for.  I'm not trying to cheat anyone out of money.  I just want my transcript to show classes that have been paid in full, which is about 70 credit hours.  The university is treating me like I never paid them a dime.  I took out over 15k in student loans that I currently paid down to about $3,500(I'm quite proud of this accomplishment).  Now I'm being told the 3 years I spent in school and the loans I took out were all for nothing unless I pay them $6,000.  This doesn't seem right to me.

I've had people offer me personal loans to get back in school, but that is not what matters to me.  I don't feel like I should have to pay the university a single penny to show proof of classes that I've already paid for.  I even went out of my way to hire an attourney, but all they said was that I could try to sue the university for breach of contract and it would cost $5k and I would likely lose.

Can anyone give me some advice or point me in the right direction here?  Who must I speak with to get results?  I legitimately feel as though I've been wronged by Mizzou and I just want to continue my education elsewhere.   I may have forgotten some details so please feel free to ask questions.

On the contrary, if the interest rate is significantly lower than 7% (e.g., like student loans that are 2-4%), then it's considered **low** and you'll benefit more if you slowly pay that off while investing in the market more?

1.) I'm employed full time ~90k/year before taxes. I'm not currently investing in anything. I have extra cash, and I want to put it to use, but I'm just not sure where to start. I'm not married, but I do live with my girlfriend. She works part time while finishing school and we have a very healthy financial situation.

2.) I have a mortgage in another state ~ approximately 100k owed on a house that's probably worth 120-150. I'm currently renting the property for $850/month which covers the mortgage. 

3.) I have 5 other properties paid for in that same state, some of which came to me via family, others I've bought. None of them are particularly valuable properties. 4 probably worth somewhere in the ballpark of 65k-100k. The 5th, I bought for $21k cash and have invested another $4k to get it livable. All of these properties rent for between 400-600 /month. 

My dilemmas:

My job has taken me far away from my property. Currently They're being managed by a friend, but I definitely don't have the bandwidth to pay them much attention beyond checking in with him once a month.

The property isn't making money. 2k-3k /month sounds great, but in reality, they're shitty houses and something breaks every few months. That upkeep generally eats up any real money. (Recently a renter DESTROYED one of the houses and the repairs will run 20k easily) At the end of the year, the properties combine to basically cost me nothing. They pay for themselves, but nothing more.

Raising rent, while possible, won't get me too far because rent in the general area is already pretty close to what my tenants are paying.

I don't know what to do. I feel like selling the properties would be a mistake because they're not actually costing me anything, but I can't help but to feel like I can make better use of these assets.

Also noteworthy: The properties aren't set up under any sort of LLC or anything. They're all in my name or my mother's name.

So some back story first.  

I'm enrolled in University. I have about 3 more years ahead of me. Tuition is about $10,000 a year. The cost of books vary, I'd guess anywhere from $300 to $1000 a year. I also live in student living, which costs about $550 a month ($6,600 a year). So I figure a yearly total cost of about $17,500 a year for my studies for the next three years

Here's the good news. I have a job. During school I make $600 a month. During break I make about $1200 a month. This equals about $10,200 yearly income. I also have a substantial savings. I have $10,000 in savings and  $17,000 in the stock market as of last Friday (The value goes up and down). 

So, do I need to take out Student Loans? I don't enjoy my job and would like to focus on my education. Any advice would be helpful.

Also, I qualify for unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and those are only $7,500 a year. I think interest rate is 4.6% for those things.",finance,1416182364
personalfinance,"Making a presentation for coworkers ""The Secret Behind Your Credit Score""","**For a few months now I have been the ""Finance guy"" at work**, and I wanted to start putting the knowledge I've gained reading and asking questions here in Personal Finance to good use. The plan is to make a bunch of ~10 minute presentations around the hot topics of finances to fix some misconceptions people may have and to try to encourage good financial habits.

**The first presentation will be about your credit score.** This seems like the best one to start with because it is an attention grabber. People love to worry about their credit score even more than their high interest credit card debt. This will hopefully solve the mystery of the credit score.

**The audience will be** enlisted military members ages 20-35 with a majority under 25. Sadly most im sure have credit card debt and prefer not to save much. This makes this a sensitive subject so I try to avoid ""Don't do this"" as much as possible and just try to share information.

**Rough Outline Subject to Change:**

* What is a credit score and how do you get one? (loans/credit cards/missed payments)

* What is a credit report, is that different? (Get your report free from each bureau AnnualCreditReport.com)

* What is a good credit score useful for? (low interest rates on car loan, best mortgage rates, lower car insurance, and better credit card rewards)

* What makes a good credit score? (35% Payment history, 30% credit utilization, 15% length of credit history, 10% types of credit, and 10% hard pulls) 

http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/whatsinyourscore.aspx

* Where do I find my credit score? (Certain credit cards give you a real credit score, but CreditKarma.com gives you an estimation +/- 50 points)

* What's the best way to get a good credit score? (Get a credit card and pay it off every month after you get the bill and before the due date. Most importantly don't miss payments.)

* Common Misconceptions (1. Carry a balance to improve credit score and paying interest makes the bank trust me more, 2. Open a loan just to improve credit score, 3. Pay off card right after purchase to improve credit, 4. Closing accounts will help my credit score, 5. Getting a credit card will hurt my score in the long term)

**Now I could stop here.** What I really want to do is go into detail about churning credit cards, but many in my audience carry a balance on their credit cards making churning pretty futile. I could do a very short bit about it under ""What is a good credit score useful for?"" talking briefly about rewards cards.

**The next presentations** will be ""The Magic of Compounding Interest"", ""Make a Killer Budget"", ""20 Easy Ways to Save Thousands a Year"", ""Retire by the age of 40"", ""Get Rich Using Your Credit Score"" talking about churning credit cards, and added ""True Cost of a New Car""

investing,100 % in S&amp;P100 ? Newbie need advice ! (Have read FAQ and every link in guideline),"Hi, I'm a 20 Y/O male that have saved up a small amount of money, Id like to think that I'm good with money, i don't buy shit i don't need, i still live with my parent.

I got a job in February after high school  and make around 1000 USD a month and study at the same time.
I got no expenses what so ever, my parents are kind enough to pay for everything (Its in our culture that parents pay for everything until you get married or move out for some reason)
so i tend to save about 800-900 USD every month and i got around 15,000 USD saved up in a bank with terrible interest rate.

I have opened a investment account and read up about the stock market religiously the last week, I'm still a complete idiot, and allot of the terms i still don't understand, because my native language is not English.

I'm not a greedy person, and i got a big amount of patience, my plan is to put my 15K in SP100 or SP500 for the next 10-15-20 years, and add around 7-9 K every year, more if i get a better paying job in the future.

I mean, even if the stock market would crash, in the long term, it should still go up, even if there is no guarantee, but ill amuse its 99% secure, and that even in the worst case scenario, i wont loose my money.

And then I'm going to invest the rest off the money i make, in individual stocks i have faith in, For an example Apple or Google.

I'm not expecting to become super rich, but it would be nice to able to have saved up about 100 K USD by the time I'm 25 so i can hopefully get a house for myself, And if i manage to save up another 10-12 K every year, + Add interest above it, i think it is and achievable goal.

What are you´re toughs about my plan ?

What should I claim for my part time job?  Should I do a 0 or would a 1 be okay without me having to owe and still get the most back each week as opposed to the end of the year?

personalfinance,I need advice on the frequency with which I should make student loan payments,"So, just a quick background.  This is my first post here, I've lurked for about a month now.  I graduated from college in April and got a job starting in May where I take home about $2600/month after taxes.

I have $66k in public loan debt ($31k student loans, $35k parent loans), split across 7 loans with varying interest rates.  I have minimum payments of ~$360 and ~$390 respectively.  My debt has been accruing ~$350 total in interest a month since May, and since then I've been making payments of $1100 once per month.  I'm content with the rate at which I'm paying them back, because I live fairly comfortably otherwise, and I expect to be making more money at my job as I gradually move up the ladder.  

My question for you all is would it be more efficient to make several payments per month to keep from paying more interest on interest?  I would ideally like to send manual payments for the amount of accrued interest (from my last payment) twice per week.  I would make these payments on top of the $1100 I already pay.  I've searched for any advice on this on reddit and elsewhere on the internet and I can't seem to find the right search string to come across the right advice, but maybe I'm not searching hard enough.

Any help is appreciated, thank you.",finance,1416188331
stocks,Going on record saying we are about to face a major pull back,"Reddit will down vote  me, say I'm an idiot. I don't care. 

Why am I bearish. 

1. Oil. and this might sound stupid as down oil is great for the economy (it is I don't disagree with this) but shale oil has been funded via hundreds of billions possibly even a trillion worth of debt all that needs $90-$100 oil to allow those who took out the loans to pay back. Remember sub prime.. No one thought the home prices were going to go down in value. No one thought oil would go down in value... 

2. Emerging market debt, like oil a ton of debt has been issued. Like oil this debt is based on artificially low rates based off the 10 year. As the dollar strengthens the emerging market currencies will go down in value and their economies will be forced to combat this and raise rates. This debt which didn't price in the real risk will also be another possible one to default. 

Long and short we have issued an absurd amount of debt all based on the low fed funds rate, and the market has sought yield as there is none in treasuries. We are back to 2007-08 again.. 

The oil bubble is what really scares me as the oil market is starting to pop. 

You can look at what is going on in Japan and the quantitative easing they announced which made the markets rally did nothing to stop them from entering into a recession. 

Please Please be very conservative and consider cash or other very conservative investment positions, and consider buying puts to protect that position. 

I could be very wrong, and timing matters on this which I also could be wrong on... But I want to go on record. I want to warn you and start this convo so what happened to many in 2008 doesn't happen again. 

Note I'm absurdly bullish long term and despite fearful of a crash I look forward to it as when everyone else is running for the exits you can look and find amazing opportunities. But not if you aren't prepared, and not if you don't have an idea of what's going on. 

Please tear me apart, I hope I'm wrong... But I can't sit here and not talk about this...

personalfinance,Do you have a credit card? Are you carrying a balance? Ask your bank about getting the low interest card!,"Most bank tellers won't even mention it, or they'll downplay it because it has an annual fee, but every bank should have a lower interest rate credit card, where the interest is often half of those Rebate or Reward credit cards that they always try to sell. In my case, I had a Rebate Rewards credit card with a bank in Canada. The interest rate was 19.25%. Their lower interest rate card has a fee of $25 a year and an interest rate of around 9%. If a financial adviser at my new bank hadn't mentioned the low interest card was an option, I wouldn't have known. So here I am to tell you guys.

personalfinance,Paying off deceased parents mortgage,"Hi, so me my bro &amp; sisters parents both passed away. My brother and I are 20 and my sister is 27. We have inherited our parents house and want to pay off the rest of the mortgage. there is currently 444k left on the mortgage. we have a 4.75% refinanced interest rate and have around 30 years to go on the mortgage. we get $750 knocked out in principal each month and pay $1800 in interest. We want to pay the house off asap.

My brother and I have $280000 cash and want to dump all of that money (maybe set aside 10k for emergencies.) into the mortgage to reduce the balance to 164k. Our sister has no savings she could use on the mortgage, so we would come to an agreement where my brother and I own 280k extra in equity, and we would get that when we sold the house. we also have our moms retirement account which was 1 million split 3 ways = 333k each. The problem here is that taking money out of a retirement account means you have to add it to your income and pay income tax on it at the end of the year. However, mortgage payments are tax deductible, no? So if we each took out 54k from the retirement accounts would we not have to pay taxes on it since it would all be used to pay down the mortgage?
I would like to get some of your thoughts and opinions on what the best way to go about paying off the house is.",finance,1416193913
personalfinance,"95K salary, 50K credit card debt. Do I even make enough?","Long story short, I've secured a job paying 95K a year, but have racked up massive CC debt over the years. Early/mid-20s guy in NY.

I'm no longer racking up the CC debt, and I know how I got there in the first place -- impulsive behavior, serious compensating for basically having no parents (long story short, they were extremely abusive and I had to cut contact), and lack of guidance from any adult/mentor. I'm seeing a shrink and in a support group. 

The average interest rate of all the CC debt comes out to 15%. My minimums are $900 a month. 

I finally got YNAB and am putting together a budget. I put down $950 in CC minimums to be safe, and the ""3 months living expenses"" is how much I need to save each month to have saved up 3 months of living expenses (using 12k as a ballpark) in three years (12K divided by 36 months, rounded up to $350). 

See screenshot:
Initial YNAB budget: http://imgur.com/fZdrp8z  (updated budget at bottom of post)

My job starts at the beginning of December, so I won't know for a few weeks what exactly my biweekly paycheck will be. But I've estimated it'll be $2,325 every two weeks (assuming I put 5% of pretax income to my 401k and my tax rate comes out to 33%). 

I'm still over budget on YNAB. What should I try cutting back on? It's hard to find much lower rent in NYC in safe areas. I can't cut back on my phone plan because (a) I'm in a contract and (b) MVNOs/prepaid don't have good call-block features (I've used AT&amp;T prepaid in the past), which I need to avoid aforementioned abusive family members.

Also, the $950 I attributed to minimum CC payments just keeps me above water, not really getting out ahead of the debt. The personal loan payment ($500/mo) would end next august but I think I'd just have to devote all that money to CC payments after that time.

1. **Can I even solve this with my salary? If I'm only making minimums, it'll take decades to pay off my CC debt, and that's even before I consider saving towards a down payment for a home.**

2. **How can I cut back further (if I can...I don't really see what else I can cut back on).**

3. **If this debt is really too much, what are my options?**

Bitcoin,Bitcoin: The Commercial rough pass,"OK, to really get the concept and the feel of this one, better to show than tell. Watch this music video by some group called HUMANS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4oxs7S3bEI

The narrative there: it's foreboding, not good at all, what are these young people gearing up for? Revolution? Vandalism? 

Then the moment of truth, and that explosion of color and fun as we realize they are just there to party, not to harm anyone. Relief and shared joy. Close out strong.

Now that you understand the feel I want to aim for, here's the rough narrative arc of the commercial: 

Shot in stark black&amp;white, an old stern looking woman behind a podium—a powerful monarch of some unnamed empire in the near dystopian future (think V for Vendetta or Aeon Flux).

You can't hear what she's saying, it's muted and the subtitle is provided below. She looks quite upset, incensed, practically declaring war.

""We will not lose to these rebels, these *malcontents*. By midnight ALL digital currencies are to be removed from all the homeland's devices, let that not go unheard in any of the colonies!"" (the subtle irony here is that her message IS going unheard, we need to read the subtitles to understand what she has said)

""The penalty for violating the new national security protocols is death,"" she reminds the audience of Parliament members and media. They applaud in consent, but they look at each other uneasily... the old queen has gone too far. This is cruel. 

...

The clock strikes midnight, families are nervously crowded around their TVs to see if anyone shows up to the planned protest in the Square. 

The Square is shrouded in fog, bright spotlights and dogs barking, the sound of helicopters. As the fog partially clears, you see that only one person has showed up. 

A woman in her early twenties, collegiate looking with her dog by her side.

The networks cover the image of the girl, the newscasters are speechless. What will happen to her?

The young woman looks straight ahead into the spotlights and camera lenses, and without wavering she lifts her smartphone into the air, showing a Bitcoin app's load screen. 

The authorities close in, they take the leash to her dog and take him in the opposite direction. She's blackbagged and cuffed on live television. There are gasps, surprise, then silence—as there too often is.

She's in the back of a van, it stops at its destination and she's pulled out. Nondescript, ominous metal doors are opened by some security guys and she walks in.

We are then shown she's being ushered into a pulsating, massive, off the hook night club—think Marquee in Vegas on a spunky night. 

The monarch herself, the feared Queen, is on a big 1984-like screen between the DJs and turntable—a pre-recorded message from her starts.

This time because all you can hear is the loud beat of the track (I actually kind of like that song I linked to, anything uplifting in that genre that could be licensed for cheap).... you can't hear her, but she's subtitled in:

""Citizen, your bravery is MOST unusual. I must reconsider this whole affair—effective immediately the use of these bitcoins is allowed, allowing us more time to study it. And I am lifting the national security protocols—limited expression at the Square and elsewhere has been reinstated. That is all."" [the video ends, replaced with a rotating symbol for the Monarchy]

People go apeshit partying, huge array of colors and people smiling, hugging, as many of the elites and nouveau riche approach the woman—our wholesome heroine—and tap their phones against hers, sending huge transfers of wealth around the world's data pipelines and mobile phone airwaves. 

Quick montage of news headlines unfolding on the cable networks:

""QUEEN HAS CHANGE OF HEART—BITCOIN RIGHTS RESTORED—FREE SPEECH BACK""

Cuts ahead to a futuristic, Hunger Games kind of morning show—dystopian power meets the Today show, essentially. 

""Your Majesty, what made you change your mind so—well, quite frankly, so abruptly?""

The cameras cut to the Queen, a producer in the control room looks ahead nervously.

""I don't quite know, sometimes you just positively hate something, and you always did, mind you,""

The attractive TV hosts nod furiously in agreement, in that telltale way television presenters do in nations where freedom of speech is less than total.

""But a friend, a friend with a dog.... SUGGESTED I reconsider. And I did. I rather like these bitcoins now, whatever they are,"" the Queen says and shrugs nonchalantly, then smiles contentedly.

The people have never seen the Queen smile and be humorous before, or at least they can't recall the last time they've seen her smile in any way like that. 

And the reconciliation offered by the Queen calling that protester a ""friend""—families in front of their TVs start to tear up, hug, they can tell things are going to change from here on out. Nothing has been said yet, but the Queen has changed her mind, that's clear. 

...fades out...

personalfinance,Torn between rebuilding credit and getting out of debt.,"I got myself into serious credit trouble about 7 years ago after job less left me unable to pay off credit card bills. The accounts charged off and my current score is below 600. Woof. 

But I'm intent on rebuilding. I've had a personal finance rebirth and have been light years better with my money. YNAB and a newly adopted frugal mindset have got me in really decent shape in terms of my current situation. I have a cushion of money for emergencies, I'm living off of a previous month's income (very important when your job has variable income as mine does) and overall things are really moving nicely.

So my credit rebuild is the next step. Part of that is that my charge offs will be falling off of my report next spring. Very excited for that. Another part is that I've got a new credit card that I use only for gas, Netflix and my cell phone bill each month, paying the balance in full to avoid the insane interest (since I had to get a bad credit credit card if I wanted one at all). 

I also had to get a new car recently after my last car got smashed into while parked in front of my house. I was debating simply buying a beater and avoiding the payment, but I thought that as part of rebuilding my credit it would be good to have another loan/line of credit that I'm proving I can repay. The only problem I have now is that it's a bad interest rate (15.99%) and I'd love to have that monkey off my back.

TL;DR version would be: Am I better off making payments on the car loan for a year or so to build better credit, or should I eliminate that debt as quickly as possible and rely on my credit card payments to bring my score back up? What about liquidating some of my emergency fund to pay off the car even faster?",finance,1416208701
investing,Bond fund investing in a rising interest rate environment?,"So, it is ""certain"" that interest rates will rise: but when and by how much is anybody's guess. 

But *when* they do my understanding is that bond funds, in general, can be suboptimal investments because as newer bonds are issued at higher rates, current investors naturally exit the fund forcing the manager to liquidate positions at a lower NAV in order to return investor principle as demand warrants. I hope I have that correct.

While I don't own any bond funds outright, except via target retirement date funds (i.e. 2045, 2050, etc), I roughly calculate my percentage of bonds held at around 4% of my total account. I'm in mid-30's btw. 

- Is it a good idea increase my percentage of bonds in my portfolio? 
- If yes, is it better to buy now or wait? 
- When that time comes, what fund(s) make the most sense (assuming Vanguard choices)? Short/Intermediate/Long? Sectors?
- Or... Is there an altogether better alternative than bond funds?

What are your strategies?

personalfinance,"Just turned 27 and things might be looking up, but I need advice...","Hi PF,


Throwaway because I don't really feel like I'm 'contributing' to the community as much as I'm just looking for advice. I've been lurking for a few months and, after a couple recent events, would love to get some insight from those of you who are more educated, experienced, and/or just plain smarter than I. Sorry for the ensuing wall of text.



**Goal:**
I just turned 27, and for the first time feel like I'm in a place where my desire and means may finally allow me to dig myself out of the hole I dug in my late teens and early 20's. I'm hoping to rebuild my credit, purchase my *first car*, and start saving for a down payment on a condo (2-5 years out). I know none of these things come quickly, but am really just looking for your advice.



**Backstory:**
After high school I attended a small private university for one year (2007), and racked up a decent chunk of debt (private + federal loans = $17k upon leaving) pursuing a degree that I have no interest in pursuing (theology).


After a brief stint in some truly awful entry-level jobs, I ended up in the service industry and lived off the radar (i.e. no bank account/cash only, paying taxes though) for a couple of years. It was then that I started at my current employer as a second job, and coincidentally it was also then that the judgements (for defaulting on aforementioned loans) rolled in. This was on top of two medical bills incurred while uninsured in the service industry (thanks Obama! :P), that also went to collections/judgements.



**Fast forward four years (present):**
Having lived with garnished wages for the last few years, I've finally paid/closed all debt save one private loan still held by the university ($4.5k) and, coincidentally, got a promotion I've been working for since starting with said company. It is a fairly significant promotion in terms of responsibility but, thankfully, also in salary so I'm hoping that it might just be enough to help me start looking at my 30's with a more positive outlook than I've had most of my 20's. My credit right now is basically screwed, though a secured card I opened in January has been helping, slowly but surely. As of Oct.'14, my TU (98) score is 653, with the FAKO sites showing anywhere between 595-610. I'd like to be in 'Average' territory by the end of 2015.



**The specifics:**  
*Salary: $62,500  
    *Including overtime/bonuses, it's more likely to be around $75k  
*Assets: $23k in company stock via ESPP purchases over 4 years (I know... *diversify*...), $15k in a traditional 401k


**Monthly Living Costs:**  
*Rent: $600  
*Utilities: $100 (gas/electric/internet)  
*Insurance: $82 (med/dental/vision)  
*Transportation: $30 - I use public transit, get a free monthly pass through work, and pay approx. $1.20/day for a light rail ticket not covered by said pass  
*Food/Entertainment: $400-500, as I eat out 90% of the time (I know, but bachelorhood has its perks)  
*Phone: $50  
*Secured Loan: $86 - took it strictly to get installment credit on my report, 50% paid off 12mo term as of this month  
*Secured Credit Card: $10-20 - CapitolOne w/$650 limit, only used for one/two small purchases per month, paid in full monthly, and currently my only open line of revolving credit


**Ongoing Savings/Investments:**  
*ESPP: 10% of gross (post tax, buying @ 15% discount)  
* 401k: 6% (with 75% matching)  
*Savings: $600  
*Checking: $1,000  



**My Assessment:**
At my best guess (haven't seen my first adjusted paycheck yet), I'll be taking home somewhere between $3k-3.4k per month net. My current expenses total about $1.5k, and I enjoy my lifestyle, but I do want to do whatever I can to boost my credit score in preparation for a car and, hopefully some day, a condo/house.

I'm still trying to figure out what to do about the university-held loan, as it's set to fall of my report in 4 months, and the statute of limitations in TN where it originated has passed. I'd feel bad not paying it, so I'm contemplating seeing if they'll settle for what I originally borrowed ($2.9k), but also don't want to reset said SOL.

Three other judgements are about to age off my report in the next three months, so I'm trying to figure out how to best capitalize on what may be my best looking credit report since I opened any kind of credit account.

Any input is appreciated, and if you've made it this far, thanks for reading!



**TL;DR**  
*Want to improve credit score, buy a car, and be financially responsible for the future  
*$1.5k living expenses, now making $3k-3.4k per month net  
*Have shit credit (several judgements, 4x scheduled to fall off in the next 4 months), but am trying to rebuild with one secured card and one secured loan

Bitcoin,Widening poor-rich gap and inflation. Seems Bitcoin can help solve this?,"There's the old adage ""it takes money to make money."" While there are the exceptions, from everything I've seen in life, it's generally true. Those who already have a large stash of money can use that money to find some place to put it with a better interest rate, put it in ""the market"" and get a return for said money just to name a few options. 

Those without money, living paycheck to paycheck, or only putting minimal amounts into a savings account, not having time to manage their own funds in ""the market"" or the money to pay someone else to manage it (ever looked at the rates and commissions those guys get? Man... They make money no matter how they perform. Sad. ) 

The second group can't even keep up with inflation. What they have, they have to spend to live. The first group, with their sizable holdings,  have no issue keeping up with 2% inflation. (~US inflation rate) 

Wouldn't Bitcoin with its deflationary nature be more self leveling?

personalfinance,I feel like my car is on its last legs and has a number of issues. How do I go about getting my best value for it or just run it into the ground?,"I drive an 03 Olds Alero with ~160,000 miles and a number of issues have been cropping up over that past months. First the button on the AC to choose if it is using the air from the inside or outside broke, second the check engine light came on and when I plugged the computer in it reported a small evaporative leak and the guy at the shop said I shouldn't worry about it, cleared it but it came back. Third is periodically the blinkers won't turn on, when I tap the hazard button they will then work again for another week or two before I repeat that. This morning after getting off the freeway when I pushed the gas the engine revved like normal but the car accelerated very slowly. Put it in park and back in drive and it worked normally again. I also live in Minnesota so it has a tough long winter ahead of it that I'm not sure it will survive. 

I have 6,000 sitting in an emergency fund and currently attacking my student loans by paying minimums and throwing anything extra at the highest interest rate.

personalfinance,OK to use part of auto loan to pay down credit card debt?,"Hello, all. I'm looking for gut checks / some advice on something I'm considering: I'd like to use part of a used auto loan (an amount in excess of the cost of the vehicle I'll be purchasing) to pay down some credit card debt that will become more expensive in January. Are there any downsides I'm missing?

The approximately $4,500 credit card debt is at a 2.9 percent interest through the end of the year. In January, it jumps to 9.9 percent. The five-year used auto loan will be at a 2.49 percent interest rate; I can borrow up to the retail value of the vehicle, about $9,000.

I know that shuffling around debt is not a way to get out of it, but if I have an opportunity to finance my debt at a lower interest rate, is there any reason I should not? I can make the monthly auto loan payments; I realize that if I continue to add to my credit card debt, this discussion becomes academic at best ...

personalfinance,Critique my financial plan!,"Hi PF… been lurking this subreddit for a few months and thus started taking a better look at my own finances and now want to see if you all think my plan is a good one. I feel like I’m far behind where I should be for my age, but am now determined to “catch up”. Purchased YNAB and am 30 days into using it… love it already. 

28/M living in Chicago working in a stable job at a Fortune 100 financial services company. Current salary is $62,500 and have a promotion lined up by end of year (already approved, just waiting for HR to finalize… have a meeting soon where there may be some salary negotiation). On the conservative side I expect to get bumped up to $72,000. Current guaranteed bonus is 10% annually, will increase to 15% annually after promotion. 

 *Emergency fund is currently $3,100. 
 *401k balance is $19,500. Company matches up to 4% if I contribute 8%. Currently I only contribute 4%, so I’m only getting a 2% match. Stupid, I know, so I’m changing it to contribute 8% immediately. Even more stupidly, I took a $9,000 401k loan out to pay off most of my credit card debt. My spending habits have at least completely changed and I will never continue to put anything on a credit card that I don’t have the cash for. 
 *Car is a 2008, paid off, excellent condition 80k miles, no issues there… plan on keeping it until it falls apart. 

 **Debt:**
 1. Best Buy Credit Card = $900 (0% interest until July ‘15)
 2. Federal Student Loan @ 2.08% = $3,200
 3. Federal Student Loan @ 6.55% = $5,600
 4. 401k Loan Balance @ 4% = $8,600 (interest paid back into the 401k)

 **Income:** $2,900/mo after 8% 401k contribution and $246/mo 401k loan repayment

 **Expenses:**
 *Rent = $930
 *TV + Internet = $57
 *Cell = $61
 *Gas = $30
 *Electric = $50
 *Car Insurance = $78
 *Gas = $60 (I walk to work luckily)
 *Student Loan Payment = $140

 Total Fixed = $1,406

 This leaves just shy of $1,500/mo for savings and variable expenses. The last few months I’ve been having $1,000/mo routed to my Ally savings acct for the emergency fund and then the remaining $500/mo covers groceries, budgeting for future small expenses (next car insurance renwal, next license plate stickers, clothing, etc.), and fun money. 

 **Plan**
1. Bring emergency fund to $5,000
2. Pay student loans to $0
3. Pay the Best Buy credit card off in June ‘15 before interest hits
4. Begin saving to pay the 401k loan in full (can only pay it off in one lump payment)
5. Will not change my spending habits when the raise kicks in. Will use the extra income to pay debt faster. 
6. After above is complete, open a Roth IRA and begin contributions and keep saving for down payment on a house

You are very fortunate, but then again it makes up for the time you couldn't afford antifreeze for the engine you replaced in your 1980 Pontiac Firebird POS when the antifreeze factories stopped making it in 1991 and you spent the night pouring hot water over the engine in sub-zero weather in Missouri before a physics exam. And all the other crazy crap you went through to get here.

Lurk the FI subreddit hoping someone is in your situation, strangely enough no one appears to have lost their mind like you to do what you've done.

Have to buy a home? Tax reasons. Had one in Australia, have to buy one again or will have to pay significant tax on income from house sale.

For those that might say buy a cheaper home, sorry, it's SoCal (San Diego), and *have* to live close to work on the north side of the city (read that as $$$ area unfortunately) because of the work hours and the need to come in randomly 7 days a week with 15 mins notice. 

For those that might say move to a cheaper location...you *did*...Melbourne Australia is just stupid expensive. An aside: for those considering moving to Australia, be prepared to pay. Anyway, tenured professorships don't come often and you are fortunate to have this job. And, strangely enough, you like this job and think it is probably the one you'll end up having until it kills you or you drop dead from old age, whichever comes first.

At 3.5% interest, seems as if the money is being given away, but of course there are problems: 

* you do have the 20% deposit for $1.1 million home, including up-front fees and maintenance and taxes, but 
* $150K salary compared to $900K loan does not compute, 
* there are 25 or ~28 years (in theory) of loan where the interest rate might end up being unacceptable, depending on choice of loan 
* $1.1 million does not buy much in SoCal---seriously,
* the excellent [rent-vs-buy calculator](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=0) you guys recommend from NYT page shows that buying is better because the rents are 1.5 to 2x the amount from the calculator, and that's for a much less suitable place (i.e., 2 bed 1 bath shoebox unit for rent at $2.5k vs $2.1k for a 4br 2.5 bath home with garage for purchase).

What would you do?

I am 6 months out of a 3 year chapter 13 bankruptcy (hence why my wife has 2 car leases)
I had $17,000 medical bills wiped out due to no insurance being young and my mother didn't care.

Now that is out of the way...
We sat down with a family friend who so happens to be a bankruptcy lawyer.
He gave us some instructions and I want to get your opinions.

He said first of all up our limits on the 3 cards my wife owns.

Secondly, go to this local dealer and apply for a loan for 2 vehicles which we have looked at and found 2 vehicles for around $10,500 together. She will only be the one applying.
Since she upped her limit on her 3 cards, her new credit score will be above 700 so most likely will get the loan even tho the interest rate for the cars will be outrageous.

Third, start charging the necessities (gas, food, clothing and whatnot) to her credit cards after getting the vehicles. Pay the minimum on her cards all awhile pay towards her STUDENT LOANS with her check every payday.

Fourth, let the dealership repossess the 2 leased cars.

Fifth, get our tax return and put that towards her STUDENT LOAN

He then said after that file for chapter 13 bankruptcy and put all of her medical bills and cards towards the bankruptcy along with the 2 cars she got a loan for. She will basically be paying off the 2 cars for 3 years all while using the extra money we get towards paying off her student loans. 

Even tho this is a low amount to file for but it will be a fresh new start for her and us.

Prior to this car, I owned a 1994 dodge where I first hand got to experience the amount of repairs and the costs associated with them, and I thought paying for the price of a new car was worth adverting the risk of an older car breaking down or being costly in the long run.

personalfinance,Short Term Plan Advice,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I have a financial decision to make soon, and I would love to hear your opinions on the different possible options.

In the next few weeks, I will be receiving around $275k in completely liquid funds. My plan for this money is to use it as a down payment for real estate. This was the intent of the person who gifted the money to me, and I want to respect that. Using the principal to purchase a home outright is not an option in our home market. 

With my partner still in graduate school, we will not be ready to purchase a home for another 2-4 years. I would like your advice on a relatively secure place to park the funds in the meantime. Here are the options as I see it:

* CD from a major bank (This seems to give really low interest rates and is likely to lose money compared to inflation. However, others have suggested that this is safest for the short term.)
* Higher rate CD from a less well-known bank (Is this riskier? [CIT](https://www.bankoncit.com/products-jumbo-cd.htm) seems to be offering impressive rates at the moment.)
* Relatively low-risk investment in diversified bond fund from Vanguard, such as VSCSX (This has some risk and might not provide a noticeably higher rate than the CDs in the short term.)
* A higher-risk index fund (My hunch is that this is not a good idea for such a short term investment.)
* Something else (You tell me!)

* I have 8 small loans with interest rates ranging from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. My total debt is 27.9k. 
* My AGI for last year is only $6,631. I don't expect it to be much higher this year. The field I'm in usually provides housing and board and counts that as part of wages, so I make very little on paper. Very little in reality, less on paper. 
* My required monthly payment will probably be $0 based on what the applications said. 
* I selected PAYE, which had the lowest timeframe of repayment, 240 months. The projected amount forgiven at the end of that period was around 55k.

I am concerned about paying taxes on that amount when the time comes, I have no idea what to expect with that. It seems like the laws surrounding this are in flex, and it's something that may change. 

I don't know what kind of priority I should be giving to these loan payments. My current plan is to prioritize savings, but I'm not sure if that's the right choice, or if I should be paying as much as I can towards the loan even though I'm not required to. 

* I also have a bit of credit card debt, $840 on a card with 9.9% interest, and $500 on a card with 22% interest. 

Currently, I'm putting about half of every paycheck into paying off the card with the higher interest rate. My savings are virtually non existent, and my car is aging! I don't have much in the way of monthly obligations.

personalfinance,"I am drowning in debt, need help moving forward. PLEASE HELP ME.","This is one of those, ""what do I do"" posts, but PLEASE HELP because any insight would be great. I'm hoping that you guys can me find a good strategy, moving forward.

Long story short, I broke up with my BF and had to find a place quickly. I signed a 13-month lease (starting Sept 2014) for a place that is drowning me, financially. STUPID, I know. I can cancel my lease, but will have to pay $2600 (2mths rent) &amp; concessions $1450, so $4,050. I have $100 in savings right now so that's not an option. I can transfer to a smaller unit (I am in a 1-bedroom, can move down to a studio at $1050/mth), but that will be a $500 transfer fee (I could use my Christmas bonus for this). I don't know if transferring starts a new lease. If it does, I may not want to do that either because I don't love my apartment building. The walls are thin for what I pay for rent. (Side note, is it a breach of the apartment's obligations if the apartment is too noisy?). 

Christmas is coming and I will likely get a $2K bonus, so part of this question involves how to best use this bonus.

My monthly finances are as follows:

$4,200 monthly income after taxes. ($200 each month goes into savings, but I've been dipping into that, so I currently have $100 in savings)

LESS MONTHLY EXPENSES
RENT                        $1350
CABLE/INTERNET         $75 (this is included with the lease, so I cant get out of it)
ELECTRICITY              $100 +/-
CAR PAYMENT            $350 (Financed purchase at 8.98%)
CAR INSURANCE         $250/mth   (I have a bad driving record and this is the best deal I could find. I could probably go to $200/mth if I lower my policy limits).
STUDENT LOAN #1     $530 (consolidated federal at 6%)
STUDENT LOAN #2     $150  (private at 9%)
STUDENT LOAN #3     $200 (private at 6.5%)  
NETFLIX                    $12 
--- PLUS
FOOD                     $200-$300/mth
GAS                       $120/mth
DOC VISITS AND RX  $100/mth

I also owe money to a few friends and family, that I would really like to pay off. Those loans are:

Friend loan $1400 (0% interest)
Friend Loan $2000 (0% interest)
Parents loan $4000 (0% interest)
Dentist Bill   $400 (1.75% interest)


I am temped to move in with my parents and sock away money to get myself straightened out, financially. But with my current lease, the penalties would be too great. Right now, it seems like maybe I should just move to the studio, swallow that $500 fee in order to save money for the remaining 12 months.

personalfinance,Earning 93K with student loans 18K. Should I buy this car ?,"Hi,

I'm 24 yrs, working as a software engineer in the US for almost a year now and make 93K pretax.

I am thinking of buying a new car (my first) worth 33K. I'm financing it for 60mo and am likely to get anywhere between 0-2% APR.
Is this the right thing for me to do at this stage ?

What has also got me thinking is that I'm getting a Buick, and I've been told that American cars don't hold up for long. I was hoping to run this car for at least 5yrs trouble free (and with potential for more) to get the max worth out of it.

My financial situation is below :

I have about 6K in savings and my monthly rent is ~800$.
I do have about 18K in overseas student loans at an interest rate of, wait for it, 14% per yr. But I have almost nil credit card debt. And I've already paid all other foreign debts (about 20K in total).

I don't exactly have an emergency fund personally, but my fam overseas can handle me if shit breaks loose.

As for retirement, I have a 4% 401K that my company contributes equally to (or however that works, not too sure).

My lifestyle is fairly moderate. I'm neither a scrooge nor a bling king. That's about it, I guess ?

investing,Fixing mutual fund investment mistake on child's account.,"A couple years ago we decided to start investing money into an account for our children. We ended up talking to a FA at our local bank whom we trust (it's local and not a national chain so they are very easy to work with) and they talked me into investing in a Franklin Templeton Hybrid Fund-A. After reading up a bit here and seeing how banks are getting kickbacks for promoting Franklin and seeing how little growth I've had on the account in the past two years, I think it's time to start looking at other options.

I've read a bit on here and it seems that one of the most popular funds to get for children is a 529 Plan with Vanguard. The one concern I have with doing this is how it will affect the account if our kids decide not to go to university. The account can roll over into a 401k or IRA but if they want to do something like use the money in their accounts to start a business or something of that nature, wouldn't they take a huge hit on it?

The one other option my wife has been asking me to look at is investing in her own 401k for our kids. The reason being that every time we put money into her account, her company will match it so if we put in something like $1000 a year, the company will also put $1000 in giving us $2000 more into the 401k (the company she works for deals with other peoples pensions so I'd like to assume they would know what they are doing in that aspect). Now we can take money out of that 401k at any time and I believe the interest rate for a loan is 4%, but I don't have anything to compare that to in order to say if that is good or not. I also don't know if it's smart to pay for our kids university out of her retirement fund like that or not, but I will say that it seems like a damn good deal to have the company match anything we put into it.

Any advice on this matter would be great.",finance,1416261436

This is my first post here.. I have read the FAQs, but please forgive any naivety in advance. 

I am a 26 year old, I live in Los Angeles, California. I should have been living more frugally than I have been and I have been working towards changing that. 
I support my Mother and Brother a bit because my mother doesn't make enough to support herself (Life really kicked her bad a few years ago). And my brother just recently got a low paying job after failing to get a job in his field after college for 2 years.

To handle how much I will help them with.. We summed up all of our incomes and then we all pay percentage based on our incomes.. I make 80% of the total family income, but because I don't live with them... I pay 70% of their expenses. 

-------------------------------------------

**Income**

I have got a very good job where I am going to be making about **105k** this year and about 130k next year. (pretax)

--------------------------------------------

**Current Debt**

*1) Car 1(Mine):*

Monthly Payment: **$350** (Paid off in 30 more months at 2.9% APR)

*2) Car 2(Mother's):*

Monthly Payment: **$450** (Paid off in 9 more months at 0.9% APR)

*3) House:*

- 500k

- 30 year fixed at 4.25%

- The house was bought on FHA at 3.5% down.. so we have to pay about $600 a month in PMI.

We were spending about $2200 a month in rent for my mother and brother(Orange County). Hence we figured while interest rates are low, buy a house and build equity. They both live in it, I live separate. 

Monthly Payment(My share, I pay 70%) = **$2500**

*4) Student Loan:*

$9000 pending. Monthly Payment: **$121**


*5) Credit Card:*

None outstanding. Only monthly expenses which I pay off immediately.

------------------------------------------

**Expenditure**

*1) My Rent:*

I live close to work, So, I can put in a lot of overtime hours. I pay **$1100** a month

*2) Car Insurance:*

**$250** a month. I pay for my mother and brother's insurance too. (I pay this 6 monthly)

*3) Phone:*

My share: **$50** a month

*4) All other expense:*

Gas, utilities, internet, groceries, entertainment, charity

**$1000**

------------------------------------------

**Investments**

*1) Whole Life Insurance:*

**$100** a month.

-------------------------------------------

So, my monthly income after taxes and other deductions is about **$6500**. 
My expenses are about **$5800**. 


Here are my questions:

1) Do you see any way where I can reduce my monthly expenditure? (I am working on cutting off my spending on entertainment and other wasteful stuff. Moving back home is not an option at the moment)

2) Should I invest my money or use it to pay off my debts?

2a) If debts, then should I pay off student loans or put extra money directly towards my house's principal?

2b) If invest, what should I be investing in? Mutual Funds, 401k, Roth IRA, Stocks? 

3) How much monthly should I set aside to plan for retirement? Is putting money in 401k enough? 

4) Is it worth it for me to pay for a financial advisor in person and take his help in spending my money?

4a) How do I know if the financial advisor is good? Do I need second opinions? (The financial advisor I worked with in the past, seemed inclined to force the whole life insurance on me, and when he told me that he makes commission off of it, I just couldn't trust him)

5) Should I buy real life insurance? (I have perfect health right now)

My periodical expenditures:
Cell bill~$60 per month
Rent~$100 per month (help out with groceries time to time)
Car~$190 biweekly (car payments, new car financed over 6.5 years remaining. Bad idea I aware, I had extenuating circumstances)

Entertainment~$200 bi-weekly(this includes lunches packed for myself as well as eating out, drinking etc. I eat at home alot).
Gas~$0 company pays for gas. Comes to about $100 per week i don't have to spend, and isn't part of taxable income.
$150 bi weekly for retirement fund  


Single Time Expenditures:
Schooling~$4400 approximately for civil engineering with a specialization in computing technology per semester of full time schooling (taking 4 classes a semester at the moment)
Car Payment~$31000 remaining (@0.05% annually)
School Loans~$5000 thus far. Debating on more. (@0% as long as I am in school.)  


My incomes:
BTCF=$36,000 annually +gas unofficially because I really dont drive that much for work.
ATCF=$1114.72 bi-weekly.
A little about me:
I am a graduate of college with a diploma in civil engineering technologist. I seem to have a penchant for civil engineering and I wanted to get my bachelors so i could potentially one day do my own engineering on a worldwide scale for a larger company.   


At the moment I work as a project estimator/manager for a small company making $36000 annually. I kept the job because they are allowing me to go back to school part time as long as it doesnt compete with my work hours too much. I am owed a raise this year to keep in line with typ. Interest rates, but that only comes in December.  


I live at home with parents. I had moved out for a couple years and I couldnt feasibly do it without help anymore as I work 44hrs a week and I am in school for 30 of the remaining hours in the week. Including Saturdays and some Sundays. So I live at home and they help me out while I finish up my Bachelor's degree.  


My question is, how do I properly budget my finances to maximize the money I do save, and what principles should I be following to ensure that I am not wasting money in the meantime? And what should I be doing with my retirement savings. At the moment they are in a TAX free savings account, but over the next couple months I want to try investing them? And where should I look for that info.  


Current financial principles:
1) don't worry about being too cheap, try to increase the income before trying to cut the spending.
2)saving $150 bi-weekly for retirement fund already, last thing I want is to be broke, old, and not have any equity or saving to my name. (Currently have about 1.5k in there)
3) I personally think, I am smarter than average, but dumber than a stump when it comes to money. It has been a huge source of personal discomfort for me and I want to be better at it. But I have no idea where to start.

investing,"Why 5-year futures prices of oil are around $80, yet I still think oil will be over $100 in five years","Someone submitted an interesting question to me, and I thought I would answer more in detail, because several people didn't seem to either understand me (I got downvoted). Also, I do believe there is interest for that kind of question.

Here's the question:

ME: I do believe oil will be above $100 in five years.

POSTER: No, it can't, because 5 year futures of oil today are at around $80. Therefore, the market doesn't think oil will be over $100 in five years.

_______________

The posted then argued that, for the market to expect oil to be over $100 in five years, the future price should be around $100 today.

Here's why it doesn't work like that.

Let's say oil today is at $75.42. Futures' price in Nov. 2019 is $80.62 currently. Let's say it was instead at $100.

In that case, you enter a LONG position in that future. You are thus obligated to sell oil at $100 on Nov. 2019 (let's ignore daily margins and all) to someone.

Being smart, you buy a barrel of oil right now, at $75.42. To pay for that, you take a fixed 5-year loan of $74.52 at 3% rate (you can get even lower than that for 5 years). You pay a factory store it, at a cost of $0.15 to $0.50 per barrel. Let's be super conservative and put $1 per barrel for storage fees. You also borrow to pay that fee, every year, still at 3%.

Your net cash flows are as follow:

YEAR 0: -$75.42 (buy oil)+$75.42 (loan)=$0

YEAR 1: -$1 (storage fee,)+$1 (another loan, which you could borrow at year 0 to lock the interest rate)=$0

YEAR 2: -$1+1=$0

YEAR 3: -$1+1=$0

YEAR 4: -$1+$1=$0

YEAR 5: -$1+$100 (from the future)- $75.42 * 1.03^5 (repaying the loan from year 0)+ 1*1.03^4 +1*1.03^3  + 1*1.03^2 +1*1.03 = + $8.29

Overall, you have obtained a new profit of roughly $8.29 with absolutely no risk whatsoever. This is called **arbitrage** and it's a tactic commonly used, although on a smaller scale.

**You risked no capital and yet you return a pure profit at year 5. It cost you $0 to do these trades and you are 100% sure to make money. Look at the trade above: you stand 0% chance to lose money no matter what happens**

Therefore, it follows that, given market efficiency and the laws of arbitrage, it's simply not true to say that, if you expect oil prices to be around $100 in 5 years, the futures price today should be around $100. It doesn't work like that: the market price of the future is usually a little bit over the spot price currently to cover for interest, storage fees and so on; a resources that  costs a lot to store would for example have a much higher futures price. Lastly, futures and forwards are normally priced using the risk-free probability measure, but often in real measure as well (remember that we assumed we could borrow at 3% for five years and not at the near-0 interest rate).

In real life, the final price of the futures is thus determined by arbitrage possibilities: as soon as a firm finds a possibility for arbitrage (or thinks there is a possibility for arbitrage), it is exploited and the futures price changes accordingly. Arbitrage opportunities are typically grabbed by supercomputers within milliseconds.",finance,1416275125
personalfinance,Using a Credit Card as an Interest Free Loan Until Starting Job,"Some friends and I have been planning a trip for months, and will be leaving at the end of the year.  We're all students, and one of the guys I'm going with is really low on funds at the moment and is wondering how to make ends meet from now through the vacation.

I was telling him that I wouldn't normally advocate going into credit card debt, but in his situation it seems like a viable option.  He will be graduating in december and starting a good job mid-January while working at home and minimizing expenses. 

He needs about $800-$1k extra for the trip.  I was telling him he could theoretically get a credit card or 2 with 0% intro rates, and use them to get by for the trip and the next month and a half until we leave.  After he gets back he would likely be able to make all the money back within a month of employment and then just pay off the cards without having to deal with interest.

What are you thoughts on this? I agree he should have saved for the trip in advance, but he didn't and now we need a solution.  He already spent $700 on a plane ticket so not going isn't an option.

Thanks in advance

Edit: I understand there will be a minimum payment.  Will paying the minimum for a month and then having the balance paid in full within 3 months negatively affect his credit score?

Edit 2**: The job is as a commercial truck salesman and he is getting it through family.  To my knowledge it is 100% certain that he will be working there once we get back.  He will likely be earning between $40k-$50k/year and living with his parents so his only real expenses would be a car payment and cell phone bill.  Cards he'd likely qualify for have introductory interest rates of 0% for between 6 and 15 billing cycles.",finance,1416275783

I've been told the general rule is you go after the highest interest rate debt first. But what if that interest is tax deductible?

I have a line of credit(now locked) from when I was a student that's $X at 4.0% annually. I have a student loan that's approximately $X*3 at 8.0% interest. 

Now my gut reaction is to work down the debt thats not only larger, but at a higher interest rate before working away at the line of credit. But I do get to deduct the interest paid on the student loan against my taxes (15% credit for interest paid), so it seems like there's an incentive to keep it while I work on the LoC.

I'm 28 and have a salary of $85K. My employer offers a 401K, but doesn't match anything (why bother with this?).

I have about 20K in a checking account, about 5K in cash and about 20K in student loans (the net interest rate of the loans is 4.67%).

I figure if I need a windfall of around 15K to be comfortable, but the majority of that would probably be better off in a savings account, right? What are my other options?

So now for the next 5K, I figure I should put this toward my loans to bring the net interest rate to about 3.9%

The last 5K should probably be invested long term. I am thinking Traditional IRA since I want the tax advantage now? I genuinely don't know if I will be earning more near the end of my life or now so I'm not sure what to do here.

Financial Overview:

* Income: Around $200 weekly, $800 a month
* Bills: $60 a month for phone, $50 a month towards Uni, and money for a bus pass (transportation), currently have FED Loans on forbearance that will turn into a deferment once enrollment has been updated
* Loans: I have roughly $9000 in Fed Loans (Four separate loans)

Questions:

* I was told through Fed Loan that consolidation would remove my default status on loans, and allow me to utilize the Pell Grant (which would, essentially, let me go to college for free). Is consolidation a smart option with my current debt of ~$9000? Or...
* Would it be more advantageous to just use my income to support my college endeavors? College payment plan is 1/3 of total tuiton &amp; fees, spaced out monthly. Considering I make $800 a month and $600 a month is the cost of tuition, also considering the $110 from phone and uni payments, that would leave me with $90 a month to keep for my own. Because my parents are supportive and all around cool people, I have no other bills.

Owner and administrator of the site, he pleaded guilty to infringing articles under the copyright act. As David Wood, director of the British Phonographic Industry's Protection Copyright Unit, puts it, 'Today’s sentencing sends a clear message to the operators and users of illegal music sites that online piracy is a criminal activity that will not be tolerated by law enforcement in the UK or overseas. Piracy – particularly pre-release – can make or break an artist’s career, and can determine whether a record label is able to invest in that crucial second or third album.' On the same day, Newcastle Crown Court also handed out a two year SUSPENDED sentence to self a confessed peadophile who pleaded guilty to four accounts of sexual assault.

Kane's sentence was a real shock to our community; nobody really expected him to do any time. In hindsight we were incredibly naive to the BPI's commitment to scapegoating Kane and their ruthlessness in doing so (we skipped farewell drinks with him the night before, so sure we were that he would not go to jail). Even though Kane made virtually no money himself, the BPI claimed that the 22,500 links posted by users between 2006 and 2011 cost the music industry up to £242m, a number hugely inflated and essentially unchallenged by the court. Despite no previous history, despite only being a teenager when he started the site and despite no commercial benefit, Kane was sentenced to 32 months (reduced from 4 years due to his immediate guilty plea on arrest) and his co-defendant, Richard Graham of Leicester, who contributed around a third of all links; 21 months. Our outrage continued as this disproportionate, morally corrupt sentence was followed by media coverage committed to broadcasting these absurd figures (as well as the sensationalist comments of the judge) whilst ignoring the ethical debate regarding the harshness of the punishment. It is clear that in this instance, sending a message is far more important than justice being served.

Dancing Jesus started in 2006, around the time Kane's beloved Arctic Monkeys set records in the UK albums charts. 'What Ever People Say I Am That's What I Am Not' became the fastest selling British Debut Album of all time largely due to file sharing. A photographer/blogger known as Sheriff was the first to share their music and everybody had a copied CD of the bootleg EP, Beneath the Boardwalk. The majority of the tracks it contained appeared on their eponymous debut and although music piracy was nothing new, the Arctics meteoric rise seemed to symbolise the shifting paradigm concerning artist and their consumers. The noise made without a record released fed into their notoriety and the band were filling venues up and down the country long before they were on the radio. Interestingly, Sheriff would later document the band's tours suggesting that at least they recognised the importance of peer to peer file sharing and the buzz it created.

We've seen some dramatic developments in music distribution since; Radiohead gave away their 2009 album, In Rainbows, allowing fans to decide how much they paid for it. As Dave Grohl states, when commenting on Taylor Swift's decision to take her music off spotify last week, 'You want people to fucking listen to your music? Give them your music...And then go play a show. They like hearing your music? They'll go see a show. To me it's that simple'. Of course this easy for him to say the week before playing two shows at Wembley but even setting aside the debate surrounding the real cost of music, it's hard argue that the BPI's figures which condemned Kane are not ridiculous. In the world's largest copyright case, the US Government is claiming that Megaupload cost the entertainment industry $500m by hosting 12 billion files and having 100 million users. It does not take a mathematician to calculate that the supposed $378m loss from Dancing Jesus' 22,500 links and 12,000 users is at best, inaccurate.  

If you knew Kane, you would know he is massive music fan. The main motivation in starting Dancing Jesus was that all his friends could access the newest music together; the forum content as important as the downloads themselves. At the time, he was also the manager of the Arctic Monkeys' official website (his picture used by local television news cruelly crops out the band's 2007 Q award that he's holding), headhunted on the back of mardybum.com another fan forum he created that demonstrated his love and appetite for the band and other music going on that the time. He has spent thousands over the years on gigs and festivals and of course he buys originals of all his favourite albums. Being a gifted teenage computer whizz, Dancing Jesus was Kane's way of sharing his passion for what was an exciting time for British bands and although it was against the law, he was witnessing his favourite band reap the rewards of file sharing. The only part of this the media has mentioned thus far, taking a break from regurgitating Wood's comments about sending a message, is that Kane set up the website to get 'kudos' for getting the newest, often unreleased music.

As the site got bigger Kane's involvement waned. Donations meant the server was maintained and his creation essentially ran itself. The year or two leading up to his arrest, you could tell he felt uneasy about it. The youthful ignorance to its wrongdoing had disappeared and he knew it was dangerous to keep it running. I guess he never really considered it a real threat to the music he loved. It all came to an end in 2011 when London Metropolitan Police raided his parent's home in the early hours, arresting Kane and seizing all his devices. Over the next three years, Kane waited for a trial. The lengths the BPI had gone to secure the conviction became apparent (America's homeland security were called in to identify the domain owner) as was the compulsion to enforce a ludicrous punishment. Finally, the book was well and truly thrown at him and he left Newcastle Crown Court to start his near four year sentence; justice apparently served.

Piracy is against the law. The lack of proximity to those we steal from negates our acquiescence of this fact but sharing copyrighted music is indeed a crime. To this, we have no argument. What we object to (and when I say we, I'm talking about the generous donators to Kane's appeal, Kane's friends and family as well as our community as a whole), is the severity of the sentence. Kane is not the first person to be penalised to the extreme because his victim happens to be a multi-million pound industry and we are not ignorant to the legal influence the BPI has. But is this really the message (message being such a crucial incentive to the BPI) that the justice system wants to send; that sex crimes and violent crimes are a lesser threat to this society than a teenager who illegally shares music in his bedroom? Of course, the answer to this is quite simple; money talks. Revisiting Dave Grohl, I would like to share his thoughts on music piracy from an interview he gave in 2012, where he eloquently outlines his thoughts on who the real pirates are;

'I think it’s a good idea because it’s people trading music. It has nothing to do with industry or finance, it’s just people that want music and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s the same as someone turning on the fucking radio, it’s the same as someone putting a cassette in a cassette deck when the BBC plays a special radio session. I don’t think it’s a crime, it’s been going on for years. It’s the same as people making tapes for each other. The industry is more threatened by it because it’s the worldwide web and it’s a broader scope of trading, but I don’t think it’s such a fucking horrible thing. The first thing we should do is get all the fucking millionaires to shut their mouths, stop bitching about the 25 cents a time they’re losing.'

We have begun proceedings to appeal the sentence and hope that this abomination of justice can be reduced. We've received great support already and we are grateful to those who have donated.",technology,1416322960

The majority of the tracks it contained appeared on their eponymous debut and although music piracy was nothing new, the Arctics meteoric rise seemed to symbolise the shifting paradigm concerning artist and their consumers. The noise made without a record released fed into their notoriety and the band were filling venues up and down the country long before they were on the radio. Interestingly, Sheriff would later document the band's tours suggesting that at least they recognised the importance of peer to peer file sharing and the buzz it created.

We've seen some dramatic developments in music distribution since; Radiohead gave away their 2009 album, In Rainbows, allowing fans to decide how much they paid for it. As Dave Grohl states, when commenting on Taylor Swift's decision to take her music off spotify last week, 'You want people to fucking listen to your music? Give them your music...And then go play a show. They like hearing your music? They'll go see a show. To me it's that simple'. Of course this easy for him to say the week before playing two shows at Wembley but even setting aside the debate surrounding the real cost of music, it's hard argue that the BPI's figures which condemned Kane are not ridiculous. In the world's largest copyright case, the US Government is claiming that Megaupload cost the entertainment industry $500m by hosting 12 billion files and having 100 million users. It does not take a mathematician to calculate that the supposed $378m loss from Dancing Jesus' 22,500 links and 12,000 users is at best, inaccurate.  

If you knew Kane, you would know he is massive music fan. The main motivation in starting Dancing Jesus was that all his friends could access the newest music together; the forum content as important as the downloads themselves. At the time, he was also the manager of the Arctic Monkeys' official website (his picture used by local television news cruelly crops out the band's 2007 Q award that he's holding), headhunted on the back of mardybum.com another fan forum he created that demonstrated his love and appetite for the band and other music going on that the time. He has spent thousands over the years on gigs and festivals and of course he buys originals of all his favourite albums. Being a gifted teenage computer whizz, Dancing Jesus was Kane's way of sharing his passion for what was an exciting time for British bands and although it was against the law, he was witnessing his favourite band reap the rewards of file sharing. The only part of this the media has mentioned thus far, taking a break from regurgitating Wood's comments about sending a message, is that Kane set up the website to get 'kudos' for getting the newest, often unreleased music.

As the site got bigger Kane's involvement waned. Donations meant the server was maintained and his creation essentially ran itself. The year or two leading up to his arrest, you could tell he felt uneasy about it. The youthful ignorance to its wrongdoing had disappeared and he knew it was dangerous to keep it running. I guess he never really considered it a real threat to the music he loved. It all came to an end in 2011 when London Metropolitan Police raided his parent's home in the early hours, arresting Kane and seizing all his devices. Over the next three years, Kane waited for a trial. The lengths the BPI had gone to secure the conviction became apparent (America's homeland security were called in to identify the domain owner) as was the compulsion to enforce a ludicrous punishment. Finally, the book was well and truly thrown at him and he left Newcastle Crown Court to start his near four year sentence; justice apparently served.

Piracy is against the law. The lack of proximity to those we steal from negates our acquiescence of this fact but sharing copyrighted music is indeed a crime. To this, we have no argument. What we object to (and when I say we, I'm talking about the generous donators to Kane's appeal, Kane's friends and family as well as our community as a whole), is the severity of the sentence. Kane is not the first person to be penalised to the extreme because his victim happens to be a multi-million pound industry and we are not ignorant to the legal influence the BPI has. But is this really the message (message being such a crucial incentive to the BPI) that the justice system wants to send; that sex crimes and violent crimes are a lesser threat to this society than a teenager who illegally shares music in his bedroom? Of course, the answer to this is quite simple; money talks. Revisiting Dave Grohl, I would like to share his thoughts on music piracy from an interview he gave in 2012, where he eloquently outlines his thoughts on who the real pirates are;

'I think it’s a good idea because it’s people trading music. It has nothing to do with industry or finance, it’s just people that want music and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s the same as someone turning on the fucking radio, it’s the same as someone putting a cassette in a cassette deck when the BBC plays a special radio session. I don’t think it’s a crime, it’s been going on for years. It’s the same as people making tapes for each other. The industry is more threatened by it because it’s the worldwide web and it’s a broader scope of trading, but I don’t think it’s such a fucking horrible thing. The first thing we should do is get all the fucking millionaires to shut their mouths, stop bitching about the 25 cents a time they’re losing.'

We have begun proceedings to appeal the sentence and hope that this abomination of justice can be reduced. We've received great support already and we are grateful to those who have donated.",technology,1416323635

 * Given that my credit union has interest rates: .25% checking and .75% saving, would it be wiser to switch my savings account to a money market account (1%) or switch banks altogether to a larger one with more rewards like Ally. 

 * Should I go ahead and get a credit card now to start building credit or wait until I'm out of school and have a different living arrangement?

November 18, 2014

Dear Friends and Family,

I just need to get this out.  I’m sending this to all of the people I know and trust who might have a word or two of wisdom.  

I’ve looked through X’s financial situation, and he is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.  $30,000 credit card here, $32,000 in State Taxes alone for 2010, and that’s just the tip of the volcano.  He spent and wasted all his money while he was simultaneously going into deep debt.  There is no way to save the house.  There is no way to maintain his current living situation.  I cannot afford to resolve this.

The best thing he could do is sell everything, put the money in the bank, file bankruptcy, and let the creditors fight over the house.  He should have already moved out.  I cannot afford to make up the rest of what is needed just to keep him in his house warm and fed.  It’s costing me personally a thousand a month to do it.  I can’t do it.  

X has taken no responsibility for his situation.  He admits to nothing.  He does nothing to help himself.  He stays as drunk and stoned as possible and has no interest in healing.  It’s always been about what is pleasurable and easy for X and X alone.  

If there is dementia, he doesn’t want to know how or why.  My non-medical suspicion is that he has damaged his brain from too much drugs and alcohol.  He claims that he’d trade being able to drink for seeing his grandchildren.  I don’t even know what to do with that.  I know that’s his addiction speaking, but it’s an indication of his choice.

I’ve been losing sleep over this situation, and it’s been interfering with my own family and work.  I have my own children, house and career to worry about.  If X was enthusiastically trying to help or get his shit together, then it might be different.  But, he doesn’t seem to care of want to change.  I don’t know the compassionate response.  But, it’s clear that I have to be finished with this.  Unfortunately, I know that [daughter], who is in an even worse financial situation, and who has less bandwidth, is probably going to try to take this all on.  I’m sorry for that, and I don’t encourage her, but will help where I can.

The person with the most intimate knowledge of X’s situation right now is [neighbor], his caretaker and next door neighbor.  [neighbor] you are a saint, and we all thank you for your help.  Any thoughts you have would be appreciated as well.  Am I being too fatalistic about X’s interest in recovery/survival?

Thank you all,
ZZZ

financialindependence,"Taxable Income, Federal Returns, and allowances on a W-4","So I have always liked and planned for in a sense for my end of the financial year federal tax return but recently could use and would rather have that money spread out through my pay checks. I understand that I can, with relative ease, figure out in what bracket my federal taxes for the year will be and thus what the tax deductions per paycheck would be. What I don't understand is how exactly the number of allowances specified on the W-4 will affect the amount of federal taxes deducted. I get that the more allowances the less taxes taken out but what exactly does that number mean. 

If I had a consistent paycheck it would be relatively easy to move that number around to dial in that deduction or even use some of these online calculators I have found, but I am an hourly employee while in the office and am on a day rate while in the field which causes upwards of 1000's of dollars difference between paychecks. Additionally I just started this job in August so I don't even have that large of a database to work with to figure out average paychecks to come to an accurate yearly income, although I know this number is well under the 37,000 tax bracket from the short employment period unless I have severely underestimated  earnings from a part time job earlier in the year.

Anyway, that was a little long winded.

TL;DR

What exactly are allowances on the W-4 and how do they specifically affect federal taxes on paychecks. Additionally how is a specific number decided to minimize over taxing and a large tax return at the end of the year, especially for an inconsistent paycheck without a specific yearly salary.",finance,1416355262

personalfinance,"Just submitted an offer on a fixer-upper home through a FHA 203K loan, did I f* up?","House is in a great location in one of best neighborhoods of Seattle and extremely convenient for both me and my wife, but in a bad condition. Inspector estimated cost of remodeling to 100-120K, even though it's likely to be cheaper (I asked him to take the highest range of each estimate). Asking price was 500K.

We made an initial offer of 400K, up to 470K maximum (incl. closing costs). Now, assuming they accept our highest offer: 203K loan amount would be 500K; our savings are currently about 150K, for a total of available funds of 650K. Cost of house + cost of remodeling would be between 570 and 590K. This is getting us quite close to our total available funds.

According to 203K loan rules, the house need to be in habitable condition within 6 months, which according to a contractor friend is doable. We plan to stay in our rental property for that time. We estimated that the total monthly cost for the two properties during the 6-month period would be about 6.5K (incl. utilities on both properties and property tax/insurance for new property); our take-home (post-tax) monthly income is around 10K. Once the new house becomes habitable, 2 things will likely happen:

1) We will move in. That will save us about 2.5K/month on rent/utilities.
2) We will (try to) refinance. That will save us another 600/month (FHA insurance). Also, perhaps get a slightly better interest rate (currently at 4.25%).

That will bring our monthly mortgage to about 3K, which would be about 30% of our post-tax income.

Does that sound like a reasonable plan? Are we missing something important? We will hear back from the seller regarding our offer in about 24 hours.",finance,1416364975
personalfinance,I think I messed up with a debt collector,"In June of this year I recieved a call from a debt collector that I was 19, 000 dollars in debt from my fall semester in 2012. They told me that because I didn't graduate my federal loans no longer applied so I owed my school directly and it went to collections. I guess my school had tried to contact me but my phone number and address had been changed.

The lady on the phone seemed adamant about me paying in full instead of payments and I, being 6 months pregnant at the time, panicked and stopped answering their phone calls (I know, I'm an idiot). After a while, they stopped.

Fast forward to today, I realized I should stop running from this and I contacted them myself. The man on the phone told me that I had to pay 2, 000 TODAY. He did not allow me to hang up the phone at all to check bank accounts or even discuss anything with my boyfriend but instead said he'd wait as long as it takes. Apparently, since I had been avoiding them, if I hung up he would assume I wasn't going to pay and further action would be taken. When I told him that I couldn't pay today and would need time to get the money because I hadn't worked for half the year and wouldn't go back to work until January, he told me that he needed to know that I would pay the 2, 000 by next week at the latest. He asked me how I would pay and if I was going to ask my family for money. I told him I probably would have to resort to that and then he asked for my debit card information so he could set up an automatic withdrawal for next week because he didn't believe I would pay and set me up on a plan to pay 2, 000 on the 26th and then 1, 000 a month for the rest.

Being super scared I agreed to it all, but I really don't have the money to pay. I have 400 dollars in my bank account. Is there anything I can do? Am I screwed? I've been trying to read up on all of the things debt collectors are/aren't allowed to do but I'm not sure if it applies to my situation anymore and I don't know if I gave away all of my rights by agreeing to pay this guy.

The APR for cash advances is your standard variable APR of the Prime Rate plus 15.99%, which is currently 19.24%.

Upon expiration of your introductory APR, your purchase APR will become a variable rate of the Prime Rate plus 9.99%, which is currently 13.24%. A variable APR may change monthly according to changes in the Prime Rate.

Aside from the jargon of not just giving me a flat answer, I'm thinking my best bet is to find some sort of loan and pay off the card with my loan.

I am on a throwaway as I am sure with some of the information and my main user name someone could potentially identify me through my situation.

I would like to know whether or not my wife and I should invest in her company stock offered through work. She currently works for Pearson (NYSE:PSO), which offers a 15% discount on the lower of either the period start value, or the pay period withdrawal price. As I understand it if the stock goes up, you get the price Jan 1, if it goes down, you continue to buy at the lower price. She can contribute up to $6,000 each period with 2 periods starting Jan 1 and July 1.

Information to better understand our financial situation:

* Both are in our late 20's with 1 child and another on the way
* Annual combined take home $191,000
* Each fully vest in our 401k for a combined annual total of $35,000
* Each fully fund a Roth IRA for a combined annual total of $11,000
* I contribute $6,000 per year to my company's stock (large chemical company, matches 15% and growth consistently for 20+ years)
* We have started a 503c and contribute 5,000 - $10,000 annually
* We add $2,500 a year to a 529 for child one.
* Child care $12,000 per year for one, the newborn will be $10,000 due to in home friend
* Mortgage/Taxes/Insurance - $17,340
* Federal/State/SS - $32,000
* Groceries - $6,000
* Gas/Water/Electrical/Trash - $2,400

She has a company car which pays almost all gas/insurance/service/payment. Maybe on a heavy personal driving month, we will pay $150, but less than $1,000 per year. I also have a personal car used for the company which I am reimbursed mileage and make $6,800 year after gas/insurance/registration/service. My car is paid off.

We have no credit card debt. We have no student loans due to both receiving full scholarships throughout school.

Right now we are really loose with the expendable cash ~$50,000 year and I was thinking of starting my own little ""play money"" account and see how I could do. Obviously $12,000 year is not play money to us, but I wondered if I could beat a guaranteed 15% gain on capital?

My apprehension is the severe loss of capital. I am no expert stock picker and was hoping someone could chime in on what they thought of the future of the company based on P/E, dividend, etc.

business,Capital markets growth fueled mergers and acquisitions,"The global market for mergers and acquisitions, which is the most active one in 2014, switched to an even higher gear Monday when companies take advantage of rising stock prices, announced deals on over 100 billion USD. Two large deals supported the total amount of [mergers and acquisitions](http://finweek.info) to exceed 3 trillion USD so far this year. This proved to be a signal that the industry is alive despite recent volatility in the [markets](http://finweek.info), more stringent conditions and the failure of some great deals.

In the largest settlement in the year Actavis has agreed to buy the maker of Botox Allergan 66 billion USD, while the company servicing oil fields Halliburton secure acquisition of rival Baker Hughes to 34.6 billion USD.

The corporations involved in the transactions identified a number of factors behind the appetite for mergers and acquisitions. The list come cheap credit and high stock prices, both are fueled by onerous monetary policy leading central banks around the world who are trying to deal with slowing economic growth. Moreover, the high prices of the shares given to the heads of companies the confidence to take bold acquisitions, especially if they are being paid at least in part with shares of the buyer.

""At the moment its executives say, If I can acquire this company and I can not use its own shares in order to do it, it's a bargain. Sellers think, that can take a good price and did nothing grows forever”, said Wall Street analyst.

According to investors, the boom in mergers and acquisitions will continue for at least 6 to 12 months. Then a number of factors, including the approach of the US presidential election in 2016, will make it difficult forecasts.

Something new that market participants would consider, is welcome news for a number of acquisitions by investors, even those who own shares in the company buyer, they are often the biggest skeptics. Moreover, when a company starts to buy, the other around her also gaining confidence or just do not want to lag behind. Consultants also reported that companies often turn to acquisitions in those areas where they already have a strong position, rather than tread on unfamiliar territory.",finance,1416386115

I have two credit cards which I opened when I was doing some non traditional schooling and not employed. They are interest free and I have about 3000-3500 owed on them.

I also have about 6500 in federal loans.

personalfinance,PSLF opinion,"I graduated this past May with my Master of Education degree. Unfortunately, I did not get a job this year (currently subbing and working at Starbucks to meet my private loan payments and other bills). However, next year I plan on getting a full time job...even if I have to move out of state. Therefore starting next year I'll be able to qualify for the PSLF program and can start the beginning of my 120 payments. Since whatever is leftover after ten years is forgiven, I figure I should go ahead and switch over to the IBR plan now because in the end the interest I build up from this year won't really matter (I qualify for $0 monthly payments). 

If in 5 years I marry and with both our incomes we don't fit the criteria for the IBR plan anymore, I have to switch back over to the standard repayment plan and then basically screwed myself over with accruing all the interest. I could of course, file separately on my taxes which then lets me still qualify for the IBR (I don't see my income reaching over 50k by the end of 10 years). 

My question is this-I know filing separately on taxes won't give me the benefit of any sort of tax break if i filed jointly but this is the right frame of mind of what I should do if I DO get married correct? I'm so scared of somehow screwing myself over with this plan.

My father (divorced parents) works for himself renovating houses and has supported me for the last few years as I traveled around the country in hopes of making it to college. Now I'm here and it took me most of this semester to realize just how expensive this whole ordeal would be. 

It's a vast understatement to say that I have no idea how I'm going to finance my education. I have looked into federal loans, but can't apply for them due to an awkward tax situation my father is working through. I have been denied private loans since my last source of income was a part time job when I was 17.

I have received several scholarships, but will still end up owing ~20k per year at this school with the first half of that due in full at the end of December.

personalfinance,Company Match vs. Paying Off Education Loan,"Hello PF, I have a question for you all. 

I've been paying off my student loan along with contributing to my retirement account. I would like to pay off my loan faster. In order to increase my monthly payment, I was considering decreasing my retirment contribution until the loan is paid off. I am currently contributing the full percentage with a company match and was wondering if this is a wise move or more of a short-term move.

My company has a matching policy of 100% for the first 2%, 50% for the next 2%, and 25% for the next 4%. They do this for three different buckets (pre-tax &amp; after-tax Traditional 401k, and a Roth 401k) and I'm contributing 8% of my paycheck to each.

The education loan has a 6.6% interest rate with a current balance of $18,732.99. I was wondering if I should cut back to 4% for each bucket (or even 2%) and redirect that money into my loans instead.

| Current Balance: | $18,732.99
| Current Monthly Loan Payment: | $600
| # of Months: | 35
| Current Retirement Deductions: | $559.38

Adjusting that to

| Proposed Monthly Loan Payment: | $900
| # of Months: | 23
| Proposed Retirement Deduction: | $279.69

While writing this out it made me think, maybe I could keep the pre-tax contribution at the max 8% while dropping the other two to 4% for a 8/4/4 split, adjusting the loan payment to 800.

| Proposed Monthly Loan Payment: | $800
| # of Months| 26
| Proposed Retirement Deduction: | $279.69

With the $900 contribution I'll be lopping off a year of payments (compared to the $600) from ~3 years to ~2 years. Does this sound like a wise move? Am I shortchanging my future self for short term relief? Please let me know if I need to provide more information or expand my field of view.",finance,1416414398
personalfinance,Need serious help. Feeling incredibly overwhelmed and no idea where to start...,"Hi PF -- using a throwaway bc there are friends on here.

Currently my gf and I have been in a relationship for the past 3 years living together, paying bills together, etc. She and I are 31 and 29 respectively, and currently in (what feels like) a state of massively overwhelming debt. I have always had good credit up until this year (explanation below), so for the first time I am totally in over my head and I have no idea where I should begin - I desperately need any/all help.

Long story short, my gf was unemployed for almost this whole past year and we have moved from a stage of good credit to disastrous credit. She could not file for unemployment help since, formally, she ""resigned"" from the non-profit she was working at, but she was given a month of notice to look for jobs. I was the sole support for our household, with some help from her parents, and we went from paying things regularly to living pay check to pay check. Because we were barely making rent/basic utilities/food, credit cards/cable went unpaid all together. She just got a job about 2 months ago and we are finally trying to get our shit together to tackle things, but I have no idea where to start -- outlined below are our current bills/debts below, but let me know if more detail is needed:

**EDIT 1: Added in detail regarding our location and the interest/loan information I have immediately available**

*New Dual Income Take Home*: **$4520**

*Rent*: **$1800** -- **Living in major city in North East USA**; Lease does not go up until Sept of next year. Transportation is not an issue as we take public transit that is reimbursed by both our jobs.

**EDIT 2: Adding in more description re:budget -- though at this point we are starting from scratch**

*Food/Dining Out*: We were thinking to allot approximately **$400/month**. Obviously this can be changed based on what sort of money we should be putting towards bills.

*Cellphone*: Currently I am the only one with a cell phone bill and I pay **$110/month**. This bill is up to date.

*Monthly Gas/Elec Combined*: **$100/month**

*Cable/Internet*: This was **$90/month** but currently nonexistent - we just owe (see below). I would like internet only but obviously we have bigger fish to fry.

*Pet*: **$30/month** - Two cats; this only includes food/flea medication.

**EDIT 3: Corrected amount. Added Interest rates**

*Total School Loans*: 
**$25,027** -- We both have automatic minimum payments on these, and she has started hers back up since she's become employed so these feel the most managed and are most long term.

* GF Loans: $22,463 Federal -- Not sure what the interest rate is but I can find out tonight. Making minimum payment of **$145/month** @ 4.88%
* My Loan: Private -- Currently paid down to **$2,564.80** with 2.66% interest; Making minimum payment of **$50/month**

*Household*:

* Gas/Electric: **Owe $200** --- This was paid with whatever money we had leftover after rent/help from her parents, at the end of each month. We should be able to pay this off by then end of this month or next month.

* Cable: **Late/Owe $180 - $580** -- Because we were unable to pay this towards the end of her unemployment we are behind by 2 months and it has since been cut off. The basic cost for that is $180, but the last bill that was sent indicates an amount of $400 for ""parts and materials"" which I am assuming is the cable box, remote, etc. I need to call to find out if we can pay the late bill and return the box without the $400 charge.

*CCs* -- **These are my biggest concern at the moment. EDIT:I have no minimum payments listed because these are at a standstill currently in default. Calling companies tonight to sort out if we should ""settle"" payments or not. Known interest rates added.**

* Chase CC: **Owe $5,900** @ 19.24% -- This had previously been a high balance around $4,500 prior to the unemployment due to school expenses, but was being paid regularly; it rose with interest and no payments while unemployed. The card has since defaulted/dropped off my credit report, plummeting my score since it was my oldest card. I had collectors calling me the last 4 months of her employment though that has since slowed down. I have no idea what my next move should be.

* BoA CC:  **Owe $5,700** @ 19.99% -- Also used for school expenses and being paid regularly beforehand, but rose with interest and no payments. I have since received a letter from BoA stating that they would take a balance of $2700 for the card with a payment plan to close it as ""settled"". They also noted that there would be taxes incurred for debts greater than $600 settled in this manner, but I would need to contact a tax consultant to get my exact numbers.

* GF BoA CC: **Owe $5,700** This has also gone into default for her. She needs to call to see if there is a lump sum offer that could potentially be made, if this is the best course of action?

* GF Chase CC: **Owed $600** Also in collections though she reached out to them recently in about setting up a payment plan.

The stress of all of this has taken a toll on us emotionally and physically. Most recently I've started to get panic attacks regarding my own work performance (though I am up for a promotion) since I'm terrified about what could happen if one of us ends up unemployed again. I am losing sleep left and right so we are going to try to sit down tonight to sort things out/call companies, but I wanted to ask for PF's help/guidance first. I realize that a lot of our cards were high beforehand due to our own expenses (I was taking post-bacc classes for a certificate course which didn't qualify for federal loans) so I certainly take full responsibility for not being prepared for any sort of situation like this beforehand; But any advice for what our next immediate moves should be as well as the best forward plan of action would be greatly appreciated. I cannot live like this anymore.

**TL;DR: GF was unemployed for almost a year and we were living pay check to pay check. Currently have all CC in default and have no idea what our next moves should be, now that she is employed again. How should we handle our cards that are in default and should that be our first priority? What sort of taxes do ""settled"" CC debts &gt;$600 incur? How do we attempt to repair our credit after all of this? Thanks**

personalfinance,"(DK, FI, PH) Helping a Filipino family member getting higher education in Finland. From Denmark.","I'm Danish-Filipino (Danish citizen), married to a Filipina and living in Denmark. We have quite a decent and free education system here all the way up to university level, which is quite amazing when you think of it. No tuition fees, free 985 USD/month student state scholarships to cover living expenses and low 4% interest student loans available if more is desired.

Unfortunately, if you are a non-EU national you won't be able to gain access to any of these taxpayer-funded entitlements unless you are married to a Danish or EU citizen and residing on a spousal dependent visa in the country. Fair enough. My wife got her master degree this way, but now we're looking to help her brother in the Philippines get his master's in Europe somehow too. Very difficult proposition, and some advice could be helpful for us. 

Here's the difficulty level we're looking at: In Denmark, non-EU citizens need to pay tuition amounting to 3,370-8,427 USD/semester and show financial self-sufficiency by having at least 8,500 USD at one's disposal on top of this. Big money in the Philippines. Access to credit is ridiculously difficult for your average middle class worker, let alone a prospective student. No Philippine scholarships exist for helping Filipinos study abroad. Most self-financing students living abroad belong to a class of rich elites, as is the case with most developing countries. 

So, said brother-in-law of mine has a bachelor degree and has just ranked top 10 in the Philippines within his field after going through a grueling national board exam. He's extremely talented, has insane work ethic and we believe he'd be able to really stand out in a European master level program, provided he is given a chance. Without us, he doesn't stand a chance financing it himself. Even with our help, it's still going to be tough.

Enter Finland: Higher education for non-EU nationals is self-financed in Denmark, but is still tuition-free in Finland (for now). Finland, like Denmark, also requires one to have 8500 USD at your disposal in order to obtain a student residence permit, so my question is related to this amount.

We can help my brother-in-law with some of the 8500 USD through own savings and own bank, but I'm wondering if it is possible to gain access to credit to supplement whatever we can come up with. I'm very lost when it comes to international banking and loans involving multiple parties and cross-border money transfers. For instance, can we co-sign on a loan with a Finnish bank so my brother-in-law in the Philippines can have the 8500 USD on an account in Finland prior to entering in the country? Would we be able to approach a Philippine bank with the same proposition? Are there obscure credit opportunities in third-party countries like the US that we may not be aware about? 

If the banking system in Finland, Philippines or wherever isn't responsive to this kind of inquiry, we may have to resort to approaching black market loan sharks that have a thriving business in the Philippines. Reeks of criminal activity and very high interest rates, though!",finance,1416417386

Ray Istre has been busy working on art. His most recent series is related to money and Bitcoin in particular. The artist has had an interest in various forms of money for a long time and his gold and silver related cartoons are seen on Kitco.com, the number one gold and silver web site in the world. He now brings his visual abilities to the world of Bitcoin and is perfectly willing to do business in the new currency. 

His most recent works are mixed media paintings combining realistic, pop imagery with abstract design and coloring. The art incorporates designs from US Currency, such as Franklins portrait in the One Hundred Dollar Bill as well as George Washington and Andrew Jackson. Each of these leaders had significant opinions and history related to money and its use in the United States. ""The combination of iconic imagery and colorful abstract design is related to things we as humans understand as well as things we may not understand"" says the artist.

A few of the new pieces have quotes from the Founding Fathers of America, who had a timeless understanding of money and its use. When asked by an English businessman why the American Colonies were doing so well, Benjamin Franklin replied, ""That is simple. In the Colonies, we issue our own money. It is called Colonial Scrip. We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power, and we have no interest to pay to no one."" This basic principle is now being implemented in Bitcoin.

The artist takes these universal ideas about money to increase understanding of Bitcoin. He, along with millions of other people see the abuse of the Federal Reserve and its handling of the printing presses. ""At some point, people take their lives into their own hands"" the artist concludes. ""Bitcoin offers a unique way to do business around the world without having to go through the banking system.  This new currency offers privacy, which is a long held right of free people everywhere"" says the artist.

""Bitcoin is a form of money as more retailers, artists and service related businesses accept it as payment"" Istre says. His work is featured on the popular web site, Bit Premier ( www.bitpremier.com ), where there are many luxury items including jewelry and real estate to buy with Bitcoin.

I feel like for the most part I stick to some good savings and spending principles, but at the end of each month I feel like I should have spent less.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I went to college with some scholarship and some federal loans.  My parents took out loans to cover the rest. I was fortunate in that they also helped pay off the federal loans pretty much as soon as I graduated (so I didn't have to deal with the high interest). In total, they probably took out around 100k in loans to cover my college costs. We worked out a plan for me to pay them back after I graduated. 

At this point (2yrs later), I paid them back around $50k. I was lucky to get a job right out of school (~68k/year) and gave them every other paycheck. About a year ago I got a new job and was bumped up to around 100k/yr and continued to give them half my take home salary.  At this pace, I should be able to pay them back in 2 years.  In a few months I expect to be bumped up to around 115-120k.

In addition to that, I'm now maxing out my Roth 401k (~15k in there now, taking advantage of company matching), and plan on maxing out my Roth IRA (~45k in there now).

At the moment, I have a very small short-term reserve of ~2k.

I know I should really be reducing my spending in general and build up a bigger emergency fund.  I would love to hear about any strategies to reduce spending on a day-to-day basis.  

Is there anything else I should do (long term or short term)? Should I be taking the Roth route over Traditional?

personalfinance,Need advice on shared car loan situation,"Backstory: In January of 2013 I helped my younger brother buy a car by co-signing with him.  I have heard the horror stories too so before you criticize me for this I am not worried about him defaulting on it or not paying. He had and still has plenty of cash to buy it outright at any point (read: trust fund) but wanted to finance it to help build his credit  Everything is going perfectly on that front - he makes the payments every month and I check in every few months on the account to make sure things are going well.

The Idea: The part I need advice on is whether or not it is worthwhile to take over the payments on the loan for a lump sum of cash from him, essentially letting him payoff the remainder of the loan to me.

The Loan Details: Right now the outstanding balance is around ~14,000 at a 4.04% interest rate and was originally a 6 year loan. (just over 4 years left with a monthly payment of $305. 

My thought is that I could take a 14,000 payment from him and invest it. Unless I am misunderstanding this, making anything more than 4.04% on the 14k would make the deal beneficial. I would greatly appreciate any ideas/comments/advice on this.",finance,1416426742
personalfinance,Questions about a 1099 side job,"To give a little background, I have a full time salaried position pulling in $70k plus a potential bonus of ~$5k a year.  I've recently been offered a part time job doing data work.  However, while my full time position is a W2 position, this new part time gig will be a 1099 position.  My contract is $4000 for a 10 hour a week, 10 week commitment.  There is also the potential for this to continue after the initial 10 weeks if needed.  

I've been reading about 1099 employment.  I'd be responsible for the full FICA tax of 15.3% (instead of just half when you are a W2 employee) as well as normal federal, state, and local taxes. Also, I read that I need to make estimated tax payments every 3 months.  I plan to set aside the tax money in a separate account and use the rest for students loans.

Is there anything else I'm missing?  Will this make it significantly more difficult to do my taxes (I usually just do them online)?  Also, I've read about being able to more easily deduct expenses if you are a 1099 employee.  How would I go about this?  Can I deduct travel expenses to get to the office?  Also, how does it work if I use personal assets for work?  For instance, I've been planning to buy a new desktop that I will be heavily using for this job.  Can I deduct that as a business expense?  If I can deduct expenses from my 1099 job, should I only do that if it is more than the standard deduction?  I definitely don't want to do anything sketchy, but I'd like to take advantage of any legal opportunities available!

personalfinance,Should I pay off my Loans before Contributing Anything to Roth IRA,"I just graduated this year and have been working at my current job for about 3 months.

I think I'm on the right patch as far as my options go, but I'm hoping to run in by another set of eyes, and past people who are in a similar position, before I sign anything official.  I'm very new to personal finance, and could use any help/advice/suggestions you've got.

I currently have ~55k (which includes interest) of debt for undergrad/grad school.  The loans are all federal subsidized/unsubsidized loans in three groups, seen here:

It only lasted a year, and I used the extra money to pay down some high interest CC debt, pay off my car, and personal family loans.  Three months ago I started a new job that I foresee being stable for the next several years.  My gross adjusted income last year was ~$45,000, and my current salary is $47,500 annually.

Based on the information i've read, and my current financial situation, I am thinking that I should choose the Pay As You Earn program (all loans were taken out after Oct 2007).  The monthly payments won't suffocate me financially, and I can budget to pay extra when possible, and apply that directly to the principal.

I guess what I'm looking for is confirmation that this is correct, or suggestions of what I could do to handle my debt better.  Besides this I only have a very very low interest rate CC with ~$3K to pay off, and I plan on trying to put any extra money possible into the loans that I have, starting with the biggest/highest interest rate ones first.

personalfinance,Question about my tax return for 2014,"I live in the US. This year I will make roughly $18,000 from a job pays hourly. I will have paid roughly $1800-2000 in student loan payments which I can report on my taxes. 

I claimed 1 allowance for State, and 1 for Federal, same as the previous year.

Last year, I got a few hundred dollars back total, having paid about $400 in student loans, and making about $6,000 less that year due to being on unemployment for a few months.

Considering those factors, I expect to get a bit more on my tax return this year because I was employed for the entirety of 2014, paid more on my student loans, and didn't collect any unemployment which I would have to pay taxes on this year. My allowances have remained the same, and from what I can see, I remain in the same income bracket.

EDIT: Currently, I am paying 10.89% of my gross income into State, Federal and MED/EE taxes. And I am paying 7.5% into a mandatory retirement program in a non-benefited position at a University where I do not pay into social security.

personalfinance,How would you handle giving a loan to your parents?,"I've just started using YNAB in October and it is well on its way to helping me eliminate my modest amount of debt (5k student loan, 4k car). My biggest monthly bill is my 6-month tuition payment plan which is $450 a month.

Anyway, my parents have had a hard time paying the mortgage the past 5 years and have been living very frugally. I moved back home (25 years old) in order to finish my education without taking on additional loans. I make about 25k in take home pay a year. I withhold a lot and usually get a tax refund of over $4,000. I put $25 in an employee stock purchase plan every paycheck so that I can make 5% on that money 4 times a year. I sell the stock the day it purchased to realize an automatic 5% gain. I've should have been contributing more to my 401k a long time ago, and I recently upped my contribution from 2% to 4%. I plan on increasing that when my debt is paid off and I have gotten one semester ahead of tuition payments and funded a 3 month emergency fund. I only have $150 in an emergency fund right now, but I've only been budgeting for a very short amount of time. Wish I had started a long time ago!

My dad really needed a new car recently because he was spending upwards of $200 every other month on repairs and maintenance on a 1993 Cadillac. Cost him so much money, grief, and it guzzled gas. So me and my brother bought him a car in September, in my brother's name. I have no contract or anything with my brother, but me and my brother get paid on the same day and pay $80 each paycheck towards the car, which amounts to twice the monthly payment each month It is a verbal agreement that has worked out so far. I worry sometimes about what would happen if one of us gets injured or loses a job. We are already 3 or 4 payments ahead and have begun making principal only payments. 

Last week, our plumbing situation got messed up. Everything on the north side of the house became unable to drain. The south side of the house is fine. All of the water from the north side of the house meets up with the pipes from the south side of the house before leaving the property. Basically, before the north side meets the south side, the pipe has collapsed, which is underneath a concrete basement. So while we can thankfully still use our toilet and shower, we have been having to wash dishes in the bathtub and use neighbors and the laundromat for laundry. The repair has been estimated for $2,000. My parents have no way to pay unless they increase their credit card limit, and their interest rate is over 13%. 

Looking around for help, I found out that Fidelity will allow me to take a loan of $3,565 against my 401k. It is a 60 month loan at 4.25%, which would save my parents a lot of interest. Doing the calculations, the monthly payment should be $66.06, paying just the monthly minimum should result in a total interest expense of $398.60.

I'm like 70-80% confident in my parents being about to repay me. My mother is extremely uncomfortable, always has been, whenever her children step in to help. My mother doesn't want me to pay a dime towards the loan or the interest, she wants her and dad to repay the whole thing quickly. I told them to make the minimum every month, but to please pay off their credit cards before making larger payments towards the loan. My dad wants me to take the loan out like yesterday, and he wants me to take the full loan and take the left over money and spend it on re-modeling the basement (been in process for about 8 years). I kind of wish that he'd take the leftover money from the loan (whatever is left after the floor/plumbing work) and immediately put that towards his repayment to get him comfortably ahead of the payments. My brother has said that he will help my parents pay back the loan as well.

I want to know if I lose out on any ROI while my loan is out, since it is against my 401k. It is about half of my total balance.

Owe a school $4,000 with 0% Interest.  Not a loan, just making payments.

I accumulated most the debt while my now wife was going to school to be a nurse and we only had my income.  She is now a nurse and our income has nearly doubled.  Plus I have another 10 months of getting the GI bill every month and that brings in $1,600 a month.

Been putting 100% of it towards debt every month.  My credit score is 767 currently.

From what I understand, Dogecoin has a pretty fucking good developement team :0) and I'm sure they know it.  But you have to admit, we've been stagnant.  Why?  Probably because we need our devs Fed with Dogecoin, Sleeping with Dogecoin, and Breathing Dogecoin.

There's no way something worth the multi-millions Dogecoin is worth can be developed on that much money.  Bitcoin's current developer fund?  approximately $150,000-$175,000.

We need a current Dev Fund Value on the Doge homepage so shibes can see it and donate, especially when something good is done by devs(wallet upgrade, app update, etc.)  This is what drives and keeps devs.  Do good work, get paid ;)

technology,A Counter to the Highway Analogy About Net Neutrality (x-post /r/WarOnComcast),"So every time I talk to my dad about net neutrality he breaks out the generic propaganda he has been fed through the media. That the internet is like a road and big trucks like Netflix that take up more of the road and put more wear and tear on it should pay more like highway tolls. Of course this is a very very fundamentally flawed understanding of how the internet works, so I wrote up an analogy that can more accurately describe the scenario in a simple way most people can understand. Let me know if I'm factually wrong on anything, my understanding isn't perfect and feedback is appreciated. Sorry for the wall of text.

------------------------------------------------

Although it's not perfect I have a slightly better analogy for you to consider for why we want net neutrality.

Consider a water utility company. As a home owner you are given a few options of packages to purchase from the water company based on how much water you want to have access to per minute. That is, they will guarantee to you that for a rate of $50/month they will send a flow of water to your home at a speed of 5 gallons per minute if you want it, with no maximum water limit imposed per month. Because the average home owner doesn't use a constant 5 gallons per minute, the water company can use pumps that couldn't necessarily provide that rate to every single home at once but can get almost all of them what they request almost all the time.

Then one day someone invents an amazing new washing machine that provides super high quality cleaning and entertains you for large amounts of time while it washes your clothes. You can rent these washing machines from the company for $8/month (think Netflix), a great deal for what you get, and you get to use your full waterflow of 5 gallons/minute for a lot more time (put aside environmental concerns cause that doesn't relate to the Internet)! Now, in this scenario the water supply will never run out, it's only limited by the size of the pipes and the strength of the pumps. Awesome!

Well the water company starts to realize that a lot of people have started renting these washing machines and they can't provide people the service they guaranteed originally. The pipes are wide enough, but the pumps aren't strong enough. So they upgrade the pumps and everything is hunky dory. In fact, predicting even more increases in demand they install even better pumps, and can offer a variety of water flow rates at different costs to the consumers as they want to pay more for it. Makes sense.

At this point, how you use the water you purchased is up to you. You could leave a hose on full power and achieve the same full 5 gallons/minute as you could from using the new washing machine. It's up to you how you want to use the contracted rate of water flow that you paid for. Let's call this concept water neutrality. Because of this, any small company that wants to sell you a product that uses water at any rate can do so, it's up to you, the homeowner to just not use too many at once and you can get the rate you paid for.

Now the water company decides it wants to make more money and realizes that it can make new pumps that can detect how you are using the water. Since it's not technically required to provide water neutrality, it is allowed to discriminate the price it charges for water based on how you use it in your home (imagine if electricity costs more if you used it in a tv or a computer compared to lights). So first, the water company thinks 'hey we can charge users for this and if they want high rates of water for their washing machine it's gonna cost them more'. But then they realized consumers won't go for this since they are already guaranteed a rate of water flow and nobody will allow this contractual change. So this didn't happen.

THEN they got sneaky. They realized that since they can determine what utility is using the water they can go to the washing machine company and say that ""if the washing machine company doesn't pay a a special fee the water company will just throttle the water flow when it goes to their washing machine in somebody's house"". Of course the washing machine company objects and says that people are paying the water company for the water flow and it's their job to provide it.

The water company laughs and says ok. They then throttle the water flow for washing machines in all houses, making the machines unusable. Now the homeowners start to get upset but don't really understand what is happening, they see their hose and dishwasher work fine but just not the washing machine. So they assume the washing machine company is not providing the service that was paid for and people start unsubscribing from their washing machine rentals. The washing machine company is rightfully upset since this is not their fault but they are getting blamed for it, while the water company essentially holds their business ransom. Eventually the washing machine company folds and has to pay, realizing that the fundamental idea of water neutrality has been broken. (This actually happened).

Does it stop there though? No! The water company says 'hey we can make even more money if we do the same thing to dishwashers and showers' and one by one companies start to fold and pay the fee.

Companies everywhere that sell products that depend on water use (big and small alike) see what's happening and begin to demand water neutrality become a government mandate. It was the idea that the industry was founded on and the entire water using industry depends on that concept. All other similar industries have been declared common carriers to prevent this exact thing, but by paying off the government and getting lobbyists in bed with congress the water company has been able to keep it off the books despite the public outcry. It's worth noting that this wouldn't necessarily have been a problem if the industry started this way but because the last twenty years of growth and technology have depended on this, the water company can basically hold the now completely integrated need for water in everything as ransom and nobody can stop them.

The water company then takes it one step farther and are now saying, instead of individually going after each company, we are just going to slow down EVERY company that has a product that needs water unless they pay for fast lanes. Fast lanes aren't actually better pipes or a special toll for luxury pipe benefits, it literally is just extending the ransom to everybody and instead of just the extra special washing machines. So now hose companies, and water fun companies, dishwasher companies and power washer companies have to pay in order for you to be able to get the rate you pay for. How you use the water should be up to you, but because water neutrality isn't currently in the law, the water companies can do whatever they want.

Now let's add one more component to the problem: these water companies don't only deal with providing water. They also provide a whole slew of other services, including their own brand of washing machine and dishwasher, now these services never have to pay their own fast lane fee so they automatically benefit by hurting every other water company even if their product isn't as good (think cable tv vs netflix).

Consumers start to catch on but realize they have no options to shift to a different company because the water company has monopoly, this is the only reason they can break supply and demand and treat consumers poorly. How did this happen though? There are different water companies out there aren't there? Well although there are different companies out there, you can't really have lots of water pipes in the streets, so the government gave permits and subsidies to a specific water company in an area to dig up a public road and lay their pipes, an extremely expensive process to begin with. Unfortunately the government made the mistake of allowing those pipes to be owned by the water company that lay them down, so they can decide not to improve them over time and they can decide not to let other companies use them preventing competition. Since the cost of laying new pipes is so prohibitive a bunch of water companies in different areas decided that they'll just stay out of each other's ways and divided up the country, creating geographical monopolies otherwise known as a cartels.

Now we all know the US has antitrust laws in place to prevent capitalism breaking monopolies, this prevents two major competing companies from merging into a single one. The way water companies have gotten around this is by saying 'oh we're not competing with each other since we each only exist in different areas, so if we merge it won't change anything' and so the monopolies grow.
Fortunately our government has a regulator agency that is supposed to oversee this type of service and prevent this type of monopoly forming and consumer abuse (the FCC in terms of the internet). However if we look at the current leader of this agency, we perhaps find the most disturbing fact of all: that the Chairman of the Agency was previously employed as a lobbyist for various telecommunications companies, all of which he is now in charge of overseeing (Tom Wheeler). Talk about corruption.

So fundamentally water neutrality wouldn't fix all of these issues, but it would certainly stop a lot and prevent a lot more from getting worse. THIS is how the technology works, not like roads with trucks. As you can see it's far more complex and a completely different scenario than roads and highways, and is much much closer to how utilities work. This is why we need net neutrality

On top of all that we can compare our infrastructure to that of, say, South Korea, where the entire Internet is considered a utility and is run by the government. They have Internet that operates hundreds of times faster than here in the US and is far cheaper. That's what we need.",technology,1416441372
news,Could I Have Saved My Marriage Just by Using a Smartphone App?,"&lt;a href=""http://www.infidelityhealing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/catch-a-spouse-cheating.png""&gt;&lt;img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1439"" src=""http://www.infidelityhealing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/catch-a-spouse-cheating.png"" alt=""catch a spouse cheating"" width=""590"" height=""393"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

If only I had somehow gained access to a smartphone back in 1990.

That was when my husband was cheating on me with a much younger co-worker.  You see, I could have taken advantage of today's smartphone apps designed to catch a spouse cheating, and perhaps, who knows... maybe saved my marriage?

Alas, the first iPhone came out in 2007, just a few years too late- well past the point of no return for what I had believed to be the most amazing marriage.  Right under my nose, a whole new life for both me and my husband had already begun.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Had I seen the signs earlier, would things have played out differently?&lt;/h2&gt;
It's a moot point now, but the question begs asking.  If I had seen the signs earlier, could I have confronted my husband and stopped the roller coaster of despair that was to follow?

Think of it: if I  had known earlier on that my man was playing around, maybe something could have been done.  Experts agree that communicating is key, but they also warn that &lt;a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tracy-schorn/cheated-on-tips_b_1987271.html"" target=""_blank""&gt;philandering spouses will lie unless presented with evidence&lt;/a&gt;.  Sadly, cheaters will become liars when they try and wriggle out from under your accusations...so go in with some documentation, the type that's hard to argue with.

So, if experts agree that confronting an unfaithful spouse should not be attempted until there's evidence, where does that leave us?
&lt;h2&gt;Option #1: Private Investigators Can Catch a Spouse Cheating&lt;/h2&gt;
You could go old-school and hire a private investigator. For me, that was the only route available in 1990 and unlucky for me I could not afford it. Private investigators can certainly get the job done: they've been doing it for decades, perhaps even centuries.  In fact, even today it's the method of choice for those who are both wealthy and suspicious of their partner in marriage.

For those of you who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; wealthy, there are ways to take matters into our own hands.  If you're not rich enough to hire your own investigator, you could always learn how to be one yourself.  There's a truly helpful ebook entitled ""Catch a Cheating Spouse"". You can &lt;a href=""http://www.infidelityhealing.com/cheating-spouse"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read about the tactics private investigators use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in domestic cases and try them out yourself.
&lt;h2&gt;Option #2: Smartphone Apps Can Catch a Spouse Cheating&lt;/h2&gt;
Gathering evidence is certainly easier today than it was just 10 years ago.  For those who want to take the do-it-yourself approach to private investigating methods, there are always smartphone apps.  These are APPs which will tell you everything you want to know... &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the juicy details.

These APPs are often effective because chances are, if there's cheating going on, there's usually a cell phone involved.

So, what are these APPs and what do they tell us?  Most will supply you with some or all of the following data from a suspected cheater's phone. Here are the major ""players"":
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;text messages&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;photos&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;email messages&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GPS locations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;voice mails&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;instant messages&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;recorded phone calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Most can be installed on both Android and iPhones, although for some you'll need a jailbroken iPhone.

&lt;strong&gt;1.  Mspy.&lt;/strong&gt;  This popular APP has more than a million paid  users, which tells us something about the role of technology in modern relationships.  You get to monitor keyboard strokes, location data and phone calls and it claims to be 100% ""undetectable"".

&lt;strong&gt;2.  Flexispy.&lt;/strong&gt;  Their Extreme version allows you to listen to and record phone calls, and comes with a password cracker, among other tools.

&lt;strong&gt;3.  StealthGenie.&lt;/strong&gt;  Records voicemail, texts and email.  Also pulls in the user's contacts, gives access to photos and lets you see their appointments.

&lt;strong&gt;4.  TopSpyApp.&lt;/strong&gt;  Although marketed for parents and employers, an obvious use is for keeping tabs on your spouse, like all the others.  The only difference here is that TopSpyApp is operating within legal boundaries by not marketing their APP for illegal uses (see below for the legalities of APPS to catch cheaters.

&lt;strong&gt;One Quick Note on Spy APPs ...&lt;/strong&gt;

Suspicious husbands and wives will somehow need to gain secret access to the ""cheater's"" cell phone to install the APP, and that's where things get very complicated.   Now we're dealing with  legal issues and privacy violations that may open a can of worms just when you're least able to deal with another huge problem.

So, to help you decide whether spy APPs are worth the risk of conducting illegal activity and whether you'd be better off just hiring a PI or learning to become one yourself, let's take a look at the matter...
&lt;h2&gt;Spy Apps are Technically Illegal!&lt;/h2&gt;
If you're uncomfortable with breaking the law (not to mention a few moral and ethical codes) then smartphone spy APPs are not for you.  Hire a private investigator and if you can't afford that, &lt;a href=""http://www.infidelityhealing.com/cheating-spouse"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;learn how to gather your own evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

We now know that one can certainly &lt;a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2014/pakistani-man-indicted-for-selling-stealthgenie-spyware-app"" target=""_blank""&gt;go to jail for developing a spy app&lt;/a&gt;...Last month's arrest of StealthGenie developer Hammad Akbar proves that. It's the first time U.S. Federal courts have heard a case involving spyware APPS, and it probably won't be the last.

While this represents the first case of an APP &lt;em&gt;developer&lt;/em&gt; getting into trouble for spyware, we still have yet to see what happens to the people who purchase and use the APPs, like you.
&lt;blockquote&gt;People like Mr. Akbar can get into trouble with the Feds for developing spy APPs, but can you get in trouble for &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; one?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The StealthGenie case does not involve any charges for customers, according to the Justice Department &lt;a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/10/stealthgenie-indictment"" target=""_blank""&gt;via WIRED magazine&lt;/a&gt;. They're not going after anyone who currently has purchased StealthGenie, but it's only a matter of time before this will become a serious consideration for future cases.
&lt;h2&gt;Can You Be Sued for Using Spy Apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
So for now this type of Federal prosecution may be a long way off, but what about an angry husband or wife whose privacy was violated via a spy APP?

Victims of APPS designed to catch a spouse cheating will undoubtedly find it within themselves to attempt civil litigation. You can bet your bottom dollar that revenge litigation will rear its ugly head.

In other words, if you use a spy APP used for catching your husband or wife in the act, then prepare for a nasty lawsuit.  Don't become the poster child for spy APP litigation against end users.  You obviously have enough on your plate right now, without a nasty invasion of privacy lawsuit from your angry ex.

So what do you think?  Are illegal spy APPs worth the risk of getting caught breaking the law?  Or would you simply keep it legal and &lt;a href=""http://www.infidelityhealing.com/cheating-spouse"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;get the ebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead?

financialindependence,Reality check on choosing Traditional IRA over Roth,"**TL;DR**: Given our situation, should we consider paying more in taxes now by choosing Roths?

I'll try to make this as succinct as possible.

Our FI number is ~$1m. Towards this goal we have ~$500k right now, allocated across:

* Roth IRAs (self and spouse): $150k

* Traditional IRAs + 403b + 457: $300k

* Taxable investment account: $50k

Relevant factors:

* Annual income (I'm the sole earner) ~$100k

* Married filing jointly, two kids (kids both have healthy 529 accounts thanks to generous grandparents), both of us early 40s

* Marginal tax bracket: 15% (max family HSA, max 457, max Traditional IRA, 403b up to match plus a little, etc. so our AGI is much lower than gross income)

* Federal income tax paid for 2013: ~$150

* Annual spending varies between $40k and $50k (usually closer to $40k)

After discovering the idea of the ""Roth Pipeline"" last year I decided to put money we usually allocate to Roth IRAs to Traditional IRAs instead--learned about how to do a recharacterization, it's really not that hard.  That shifting of $11,000 saved us a nice chunk in taxes last year and I'm thinking of doing it again this tax year. It was really cool to get a tax refund that was almost the entire amount I paid in over the year (though not cool to think about what that big refund could have earned in the market throughout 2013!). Also really cool to realize that getting our AGI lower qualified us for the saver's credit.

My hope is that once we have 5 years of expenses in the taxable account (~$200k--the 457 could also be tapped if needed penalty-free once I leave my current job) we will have built up the retirement accounts to ~$800k. Contributing to Traditional IRAs will help accelerate both of these since every dollar that doesn't go to taxes makes it easier to put money away.  Once the five year ""seasoning"" process is complete, we can just live off of the seasoned contributions and supplement with 457 or residual taxable account money.

I guess the bottom line is that I have difficulty seeing us in anything but the 10% or 15% marginal tax bracket--or at least able to shift income sources to control our tax rate. However, you folks are very good at playing devil's advocate and have a great deal of collective knowledge and experience. 

What do you think? What important factors/considerations am I missing?

*[Edit 1: fixed itemization formatting]*

*[Edit 2: A couple of posters asked about how I managed such a low tax bill--I've pasted below my reply to /u/jelasher]*

Abbreviated/rounded 1040 from 2013:

* Gross of $100k

* HSA+457+403b+Health/Dental totals $34k, so W-2 reports $66k

* Trad IRA and other adjustments is $12k, bringing the $66k down to $54k

* Deductions and exemptions total about $28k, now down to $26k taxable income; tax liability of about $3k

* Child credits, saver's credit, education credit total about $2900, tax liability is about $100

* Did some side gig stuff and owe $50 in self-employment tax

Total tax bill $150.

Background on me:  I just finished my bachelor's, have nearly perfect credit, technically have 0 debt, and just landed my first salaried post-college job.  Why I say technically is because my parents pitched in to pay off my loans.  However, I am expected to pay my dad 300-500 a month (for the rest of eternity?), which is just going to go into some secret longterm savings plan.  It's just to give the illusion/experience of paying off debt.  

About the job:  It is an entry-level nontechnical position that pays ~70k+ with on target goals.  I'm in an area with a high COL, but I'm confident I can pocket at least 15k the first year (though hopefully much more).  

The catch:  I'm not interested in staying in the private sector.  I accepted this job offer a little early and because of extenuating reasons I would really like to pursue a job with the Federal Gov't.  I know the starting pay can be crap, but I think overall I will feel greater long-term satisfaction in a job serving the public.  I did accept this job offer though, so I am committing at least a year. 

So first I want to get my financial future in order:  I'm a 22 y/o woman and while I don't have a family in my immediate future I've already decided I would like to stay home for a while to raise hypothetical children (but still contribute financially).

Is there a way that I could earn compound interest (maybe in zero-coupon bonds) over a certain period of time? Or would a CD at a certain bank be a good option? What would you suggest?

For context, I will be graduating from college in 2015 with a BA in Economics, and am not relying on this money to support me at the moment so it's ok if it is in a relatively restrictive account that earns more interest without me being able to access it.

So essentially, what would you guys do to turn $1000 into something larger by using depository methods (or alternatives?) and have it back in your hands in, let's say, a 5 year period.

Also, is there a good time to initiate this action as well? Interest rates are pretty low so maybe I could take advantage of this and get a higher price on the bonds when I sell the before maturity.

Total: $54,013.30 -- The interest on these loans just keeps accruing so long as I am in school. I cannot pay off the interest, the only thing I can do is pay the principal and hope it decreases the interest accrues. When I come off deferment, whatever interest I accumulate is added to my principal and I begin again.

personalfinance,UPDATE: Moving Forward After My Mom Was Scammed,"original post: [here](http://redd.it/2mnxr3) 

I met with my mother yesterday.

The scammers got her pretty good. Several posters were very accurate in detailing what happened even before *I* had the details. She was told she won the lottery, needed x amount of  money to pay taxes, insurance, etc...etc...

She cleared out her entire retirement. It's gone. And the HELOC on the house, also cashed and gone. Although I did my best to explain to her that the way she sent the money- in cash, through the mail- is untraceable, she is mostly convinced that since the state police reported it to the FBI, that the government will be able to get her money back. 

I assessed her current financial situation and while it's not good, it's manageable. She still has enough money to pay her current expenses.

I got her scheduled for a Dr's appt and will be attending the appointment with her, and providing them with this information beforehand because I do want her screened for dementia and for depression. But honestly, I don't think she has dementia, or even early-onset issues. I think she was just lonely and gullible and maybe greedy and was a perfect victim. it's incredibly sad.

I am ordering her a whitelist device to prevent more phone calls. I'm not taking charge of the mail just yet. I am following the advice of the posters who suggested I not add my names to her accounts, but I will be arranging POA so I have access to that information. 

I do have a few questions that I know you can answer:

My mom has a car loan for approx $200/mo for about the next 4 years. Should I be encouraging her to take money from what (limited) saving she still has to pay off this debt NOW, or keep that money as liquid resources in case of other emergencies? Other than the HELOC and some minimal credit card debt of less than 1k, this is the only money she owes anyone. 

Could anyone direct me to layman-friendly tax information? My mother was able to withdraw her retirement without early penalties, but I'm not well-informed on what taxes she may owe on that money anyway. I have encouraged her to discuss the scam with her tax prep person, because one poster suggested she may not have to pay taxes on that money if we can prove that it was stolen, so to speak. I'm paraphrasing, sorry. 

Last question- need some feedback. My mother is at an age where she could retire and have about the same amount of income on social security as she does working. I don't want her to retire until the moment she sells the house and is ready to move- to me it makes sense for her to keep working for as long as possible while she is (hopefully) healthy and able to do so. If anyone has helped their parents make this decision, I'd appreciate some advice on how to address this further. 

I did put a fraud alert on her credit. She insists that the scammers never asked her for her DL, SSN, or any banking/credit information. 

It turns out my mother was the one who contacted the police. Apparently after she had already mailed them nearly $300k and they still wanted more money, she felt as though something was not kosher with the situation. (insert crazy laughter here). Oh and I'd like to point out that my mother went to a different bank than her normal one for the HELOC, so the new bank wouldn't have suspected anything unusual was happening. According to my mother, the scammers told her to use a different bank because ""as a new customer you will get a better interest rate."" How nice that they were looking out for her! UGH

Guys I am just so sad about all of this. The money is gone and she doesn't quite realize that yet. The plans we were tenatively making for her to sell her home and buy another outright are shot now that there's a HELOC to pay off. So $100k off of whatever she might get for her current home goes toward that loan, and she's got whatever  is left to live on. I don't think she'll get enough to buy a house in my area outright (at least not a decent house!!) so now we are looking at renting, downsizing- things she is not mentally prepared to do. It's going to be awful. It already is awful. 

I want to thank everyone again for your advice and help that you've already offered. I also want to tell everyone that when they are home over the holidays to talk with all their relatives about this story and make them aware of these scams, and emphasize how important questioning these types of ""windfalls"" can be in protecting yourself.

personalfinance,"Love it or list it -- Should I turn this lemon into a sweet sweet juice, or is selling it a better option.","Two years ago my fiance and I took out a $189,994 mortgage on a 4 bedroom house (at a purchase price of 195k) in a very family-oriented suburb of a major mid-western city.  We got a 3.25% interest rate on a 30 year mortgage.  The balance on that mortgage is currently 182,000.

While in college I racked up about $60,000 in student loan debt. 

I recently purchased a car that I still owe $9,000 on.

My fiance left me for a friend of mine. She has never paid anything into this house and does not want anything to do with it. She's on the mortgage but, aside from cheating on me I'm confident she won't screw me over regardless of what I do with this house.

I take home about $4,500 every month plus an additional $400 in rent from a friend that lives with me.  I pay out $1600 for the mortgage. $250 for the car, and $650 in student loans (ouch).

I have about $20k in savings, $12k in various retirement accounts (in stocks).

My intention is to move west this summer as my job becomes 100% remote.  I currently have this house listed at $225k. A number my Realtor arrived it.  It's gotten a fair amount of showings but no offers yet.  There are some pretty minor things that i could do to update the house that would probably change that, or I could obviously lower the price a bit. Or I Could rent it out.

The rental market is pretty strong and i think I could get about $1800-$2000 a month.

personalfinance,Is it really normal to expect to pay nearly $100K in taxes on $300K in income?,"I've previously had shit jobs paying $8 an hour or so for my young adult life, and into college.

Within the couple years I got out of college and have since gotten a new job that has paid fairly well. I'm not sure how long this job will last, but this year it looks like I'll probably make about $300,000.

I've never made anything near this before, and when I looked up a federal tax calculator and entered in income information for a self employed (independent contractor) it came up with this information:


&gt; **Income:** $300,000
&gt; 
&gt; **Taxable Income:** $274,629
&gt; 
&gt; **Self Employment Tax:** $22,542

I usually do my taxes online and thought about paying a professional to do them, but given my current lifestyle of still renting an apartment, working from home via the internet having no travel\gas and such I couldn't really think of anything that might be a significant deductible to reduce my tax bill.

Are the people who pay 18% taxes or whatever strictly millionaries and an upper middle class range like that is stuck paying ~30% tax no matter what?

personalfinance,How to get my dream car? Help?,"Hi Reddit,

How do you afford a S Class. I feel like i'm missing something. I have always dreamed of having one from a young age and I have worked very hard to get to 100k a year and I'm 25 (this puts me in like the top 1% for my age and i still struggle to understand how to afford it) I went to school and got a BA in computers and work as a programmer in a low cost of living area.

So the budget:
100k = $5435 a month after state and federal taxes. Then you max out your 401k like everyone tells you ($-17,500) and you are left with $4,587.29 a month after state and federal taxes.

Take that $4,587.29 a month - the below.

* $12.50 (rent insurance)
* $50.00 (random needs IE toothpaste soap etc)
* $56.00 (Internet)
* $80.00 (Cable T.V)
* $122.71 (car insurance)
* $104.99 (cell phone)
* $150.00 (electricity) 
* $200.00 (gas)
* $300.00 (food)
* $200.00 (fun money (movies eating out W/E)
* $2,000 (mortgage + PMI + Taxes)
* $500 (liquid savings (think vacation or stuff happens fund.)

You are left with $811.09! That's not enough to afford even a lease payment on the s class. Let alone the higher cost of insurance. So am I missing anything or is my spending out of control? Or does it really just boil down to even twice the annual income is not enough for a s class. S class lease is $1,300 a month.

Bitcoin,Why is the bitcoin community not outraged by the Bernard von NotHaus/Liberty Dollar case?,"It is my opinion that Bernard was fully within his rights, just as we are to support and use bitcoin. Lets show some support and help him out. 

Here is an interview of Bernard - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=argq_cxalZ8

You can donate here: http://givv.org/recipients/bernard-von-nothaus-legal-fund

Here is the last newsletter:

&gt;""Back in 2009, after a raid on his businesses in 2007, Bernard von NotHaus, the man behind the Liberty Dollar, was arrested and charged with various crimes connected to counterfeiting. He was convicted in federal court in North Carolina in 2011, but has still not been sentenced. 

&gt;As I wrote in 2011:

&gt;His conviction was based on the premise that a minted round of nearly pure silver that is neither the same size nor denomination as any existing U.S. coin and does not display identical imagery is nonetheless a counterfeit of U.S. currency. In a press release announcing the conviction, U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins described the Liberty Dollar as a form of “domestic terrorism.”

&gt;Von NotHaus, who once ran an organization called the National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve and Internal Revenue Codes, explicitly advertised his silver product as competition to federal fiat money. He called the Liberty Dollar a “voluntary private barter currency,” a phrase that appeared on the coins in later mintings.

&gt;See this from 2012 for many of the details of the convoluted case, and this on the original raids on Liberty Dollar.

&gt;This week, a long-simmering motion to have his conviction overturned was denied by U.S. District Judge Richard Vorhees. 

&gt;Summation and excerpts from Vorhees' order:

&gt;these post-conviction filings present a question as to the scope and extent of Congress’s constitutional power to coin money and regulate its value whether Congress, under the Constitution and by enactment of 18 U.S.C. § 486 and its prohibition of coins “intended for use as current money,” has the power to coin money to the exclusion of all others, including individuals like Defendant von Nothaus.....

&gt;After presenting a series of what he sees as precedent decisions in support of his conclusion, Vorhees writes:
&gt;the undersigned is of the opinion, and this Court so finds as a matter of law, that Congress indeed possesses the power to criminalize an individual’s minting of coinage, whether in resemblance of U.S. coins or of original design, that is intended for use as current money.

&gt;Von NotHaus had more arguments:

&gt;Defendant contends that in order to be “current,” the U.S. money with which the Liberty Dollar is accused of seeking to compete must be genuine items of U.S. currency presently in circulation and of the same denomination.....

&gt;According to the defense, because the United States does not mint silver coins in denominations of $5, $10, $20, and $50, the values of the accused Liberty Dollar pieces, the conviction under § 486 must be vacated. The undersigned declines to construe the phrase “intended for use as current money” as narrowly as the defense proposes.....

 &gt;the Court construes 18 U.S.C. § 486 such that, regardless of the nature of the subject coin (in resemblance or of original design), if a coin is “intended for use as current money” then there must necessarily be a deceptive quality about its design. In other words, resemblance and original design, while capable of independent existence, are not necessarily mutually exclusive under a plain reading of the statute.
&gt;The rest of Vorhees' opinion knocks down von NotHaus' claims of insufficient evidence of criminal intent, that the jury was given improper instructions on the extent of the government's exclusive power to coin money, and that some of the evidence against him given by federal agents should be considered inadmissable hearsay.

&gt;As noted in this Coinweek story on the case, von NotHaus is scheduled to finally receive sentencing in this case on December 2, reminding readers that the 70-year-old man has been awaiting sentence for over 3 and a half years now.""",cryptocurrency,1416502951

personalfinance,Health Insurance was cancelled. Can't find an affordable HSA plan without a 41% price increase.,"I'm self employed and am making a little bit more than the federal subsidy max limit. My health insurance was cancelled because it was not fully compliant with ACA / Obamacare. I was paying $92 a month.

The best price I can find on a new plan from healthcare.gov is about $130 a month. That's the case even though I'm willing to have a huge deductible of $6000+ with a bronze insurance plan. I'm very healthy, 28, non-smoker. Because of this, a HDHP with an HSA is by far the best option. 

Is it possible to get an HSA eligible plan with a catastrophic or short term policy? 
When I look up those prices, I can find them for as cheap as $50-60 a month. These plans are just about the same type of insurance I currently have, and I'm very happy with my current insurance. I qualify for an ACA / Obamacare waiver since my plan was cancelled. Therefore, I won't face a fine if I buy non-compliant insurance.


If the short term / catastrophic HSA route doesn't exist, is it still possible to find normal health insurance somewhere that sells HSA plans that are non-Obamacare compliant? Those plans had much lower monthly premiums.

Any help would be very appreciated. I know the increase is only about $480 a year, but I live in Chicago due to work, and am struggling to cover bills and rent.",finance,1416509199

Many users crafted form letters to our congresspeople, and I took one, used it and sent it away to my legislators.

First, Mr. Toomey did not respond to our calls to remove the FCC chairman. Secondly, he is selfishly responded to his own personal views rather than my own or the views of his constituents.

Emphasis below mine.  

&gt; Thank you for contacting me about the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) net neutrality regulation. I appreciate knowing your thoughts on this issue.
&gt; 
&gt; As you may know, the FCC adopted an Open Internet Order, better known as ""net neutrality,"" that imposed new federal regulations on the types of services Internet providers could offer. On January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC's net neutrality regulation, stating that the FCC did not have the statuary authority to compel a broadband provider to follow the Open Internet Order.
&gt; The FCC is currently exploring other ways of regulating the Internet. Specifically, President Obama, among others, has called upon the FCC to regulate Internet providers as utilities under Title II of the Communications Act, which would allow for extensive federal regulations.
&gt; 
&gt; ***I* support an Internet free from government control.** I understand the concerns expressed by those who support net neutrality regulations; **however, *I* also believe that such federal mandates would unduly inhibit this industry's innovation, investment in new technology, and job creation.** Moreover, the Internet and online content have thrived in the United States without net neutrality regulations, which throws into question the need for more government intervention. Although there is currently no legislation before the Senate addressing net neutrality, please be assured that I will keep your thoughts on net neutrality in mind, should the Senate begin consideration of open internet legislation.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.

My oldest line of credit is from a Citi® Dividend World MasterCard® with 19% APR. The credit line is $7,630 with a balance of $6,500. Have always paid on time but now I realize much more clearly that the interest rate is too high. 

I have been looking at other cards with lower APR but I'm still trying to understand if that would be the best option and, at this point, I'm thinking it is. 

My TransUnion Credit score is at 743 on Credit Karma and it has been recommending the Discover it® - 18 Month Balance Transfer and Citi® Diamond Preferred® Card. 

I understand that to transfer a balance it would charge around 3% but I'm willing to do that if it will help in the long run. 

Now what i'm trying to understand is if with the Diamond Preferred card that has an introductory 0% APR on purchases and 0% APR on balance transfer for 18 months, do I just transfer as much as I get approved for from the Citi Dividend card card and keep on paying that since it has the interest is on it? Does the 0% means it will technically sit there without accumulating any more for 18 months and I can worry about paying the other card first? Will my credit score be affected much by this or should I just worry about paying off everything first?

Both charges were incurred on Veteran's Day (11/11); I bring up the day that the charges took place only to make the point that neither my wife nor I even used the cards or did any shopping of any kind on that day  Both charges were also to vendors in California (we are in Idaho).

There are 2 things that make this situation strange: 

First, both the purchases were actually delivered to our house via FedEx, one of them even arrived the next day.  Why would someone buy something with our credit card and have it sent to our house?

Second, and even more strange, is that when I called one of the companies to ask them if they could provide any insight as to how these fraudulent charges occured, the person told me that an online account was set up and this person deliberately put in our address for both the billing and shipping address.  In other words, it was not a situation where someone could have accidentally checked a box to have the items sent to the same address as the billing.  The lady also told me that the account was set up with 'Mom' as the person's name and for an email they put in my actual email except missing the first letter.  And in case you're wondering, there is zero chance that my mom could have done this as a present or as a prank or something.  For what it's worth, both shipments were mailed to my wife though, not me.  

Our credit card company has already reversed the charges, I am not worried about the charges themselves, I am trying to figure out though if this is indicative of something more serious or if there is some breach of my personal information leaking from somewhere.

personalfinance,Feasibility of obtaining a private loan to pay off student loans?,"Hi PF, long-time listener, first-time caller.  I was curious about whether anyone here had ever used a private loan to pay off student loans?  Well, how about some background first?  

My wife and I got married in 2012, and I began grad school that fall.  We had a good chunk of change banked between what we had saved up and from wedding money.  She bought her car used in 2009, and we were able to refinance it at the local credit union from 7% to 3.5%.  We polished off her car payments this past January.  I own a 2007 car which I bought new and was paid off by 2010.  She also had around $2,500 in student loan debt, which we were also able to pay off while I was in school.  I graduated in May of this year and begin a position in state government in January.

Current situation: I have about $8,000 in federal loans left from undergraduate, which are now at an awesomely low 1-2% interest rate.  However, graduate school was $10,000/semester (in-state tuition).  I now also have $40,000 in federal loans at 7%, for which the grace period has just ended and I've started making payments.  I just checked my credit reports a couple of weeks ago, as I always do each year using annualcreditreport.com.  My credit is excellent, including an Experian credit score of 723.  It helped a lot that my dad added me to his main credit card and kept me on for 10 years in order to help build my credit.  Plus, the wife and I have paid everything early or on time.  Her credit report is good, also.

So, my question for you is this: have any of you ever obtained a private loan in order to repay federal student loans?  If the interest rate is low enough, it seems like it would be worthwhile to do, like if I was able to replace my 7% student loans with a 5% private one.  Also, it could be discharged in the event of bankruptcy.

P.S.: It drives me crazy that most of the discussion about student loans in the federal government settles around undergraduate loans, which I would guess are a huge chunk of student debt, and not graduate loans, which have a much higher interest rate.",finance,1416523991

Please do be kind and respectful, though straight forward, as I am here to learn and would like some advice on my situation. I have called Victoria's Secret's customer service line and got some somewhat helpful information, but I would also like to know where else to look.

What happened: I went to VS to buy a couple of bras and at checkout the lady asked me if I wanted to take 15 dollars off by signing up for VS Angels. I literally just thought it would be some type of points card, that is it. As I have done that sort of thing before with zero consequences. Not once did she tell me what it truly is or explain to me all of the cons of it. I do take responsibility for being naive, but I am moving past that now.

Anyway, so I ""signed up"" for the card and she was like ""Okay, here's all your new credit card info, it'll be shipped to you in a week."" I was floored. I do not want a new credit card, I have no need for this VS credit card, I am scared shitless.

I have heard horror stories of bad credit ruining you for life, etc. I am usually a very responsible person, never borrow money, have no loans, nothing like that. The card is with Comenity Bank; I do not even know who that is. I have Chase and Bank of America. 

I want to minimize damage being done to my credit. The options I have heard so far are:

1) Close the card immediately and damage your credit

2) Pay off the card (which I did immediately once I realized what had happened) and don't use it, which will damage your credit

3) Use the card and pay the bills on time each month and this won't damage your credit?

Please help me. I am really scared that I have fucked up my life by unknowingly getting this card. Have I screwed myself over? People open these Angels cards all the time, surely this isn't some colossal screw up.

Any advice, or directions on where to go from here would be great. I'm really freaking out. I have never done something like this before. I had no idea this was a credit card, VS even told me that she should have briefed me. I am not a huge shopper of VS, I get bras like 1-2 times a year in batches of 2-4.

personalfinance,Graph of predicted end of life assets at various saving rates and interest rates,"I have always found it a bit tricky to wrap my mind around how interest rates and personal savings will affect my assets at various stages in life, including after retirement. [So I made a graph](https://imgur.com/gallery/TeXB5Nc/new). It plots projected assets for:

- monthly savings of $250, $500 and $1000 (or €, or any other currency);
- yearly interest rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% (above inflation);
- after-retirement monthly living expenses of $750, $1500 and $3000.

I thought it turned out quite informative, so I thought I'd share it with the /r/personalfinance community for a realism check. Did I miss anything important? Are the interest rates realistic? How would you incorporate risk into a graph like this, since greater returns on investment typically are associated with higher risk?

We are all on the front line gentlemen things are going to be bumpy but after the dust settles a new paradigm will emerge. All our contributions and belief in the system will materialize into reality and all our struggles will be well worth it. 

""The journey is what matters not the start or finish they are just point A and Point B.""

Personally i lost close to $200,000 i wont go into the details because i don't want to talk about it, but i'm not complaining not one bit i am happy for what i have and don't like to dwell on the past. I like to reflect on the good i have done, given to Seans outpost and fed 150 people i have given to the Litecoin Assosiation and to Dogecoiners, i have given countless crypto away to total strangers and the joy to see others less fortunate smile was something really special. 

""The good actions you do for someone less fortunate is something everyone in a position to do so should do once in there lifetime.""

Nothing else matters not the money not if i did this or if i did that or if i did not get scammed, whatever it is just make sure you reflect and learn you develop and grow.

The collapse of Mt Gox showed the need for improvement the need to make things stronger and better, not just for a select few but for the collective bitcoin ecosystem, if a weak or vulnerable link in the chain is found and not fixed everyone is effected. 

I think a decentralized bitcoin exchange would be a giant leap for Bitcoin, however many centralized exchanges would suffer in the short term it would be a important step foward for bitcoin as it would provide bullet proof availability and reliability and have a lake of liquidity and leading cryptographic security just like what the Bitcoin core protocol is built on, the system could have the same bitcoin currency incentive to manage the exchange where a wallet (node) with a positive amount of bitcoin in it could use proof-of-work (POW) and run in the cloud for maximum reliability; a truly global decentralized green exchange for everyone. (shower thought)

""Bitcoin is going through the natural evolution of improvement just like everything else in the universe.""

I know Pandora's box was opened in 2009 and the contents of Satoshi's vision looked fuzzy but our collective intelligence is slowly building the framework and integrating the internet of money into every device on earth for the improvement and well being of mankind.

The problem is my card number has been compromised TWICE this year. The first time I caught it myself in the pending changes when I went in to pay my bill, the second time the card company called me - after the asshole had maxed me out ($3000+ at ticketmaster in one day and hundreds in Chinese food and that didn't raise any flags?).

I understand compromises happen but the first breach back in January still hasn't been resolved - they lose my letters, are slow to respond and at one point tried to put the charges back on me until I waited on hold 90 minutes to get a human to reopen my case. This most recent one will probably be equally painful.

So I want a new card. Something that will actually take fraud seriously and leave my current card as a backup if something happens to the new one. I've been considering applying for the Venture card since their miles rewards are generous and I like to travel. But there is an annual fee so that is something to think about too.

Can anyone recommend a particular card? I'm not concerned about APR or anything since I don't carry a balance but is there anything I'm not considering? I've never ""shopped around"" for a credit card before and I appreciate your advice.  Thanks!

personalfinance,Company Match vs. Education Loan,"Hello PF, I have a question for you all. 

I've been paying off my student loan along with contributing to my retirement account. I would like to pay off my loan faster. In order to increase my monthly payment, I was considering decreasing my retirment contribution until the loan is paid off. I am currently contributing the full percentage with a company match and was wondering if this is a wise move or more of a short-term move.

My company has a matching policy of 100% for the first 2%, 50% for the next 2%, and 25% for the next 4%. They do this for three different buckets (pre-tax &amp; after-tax Traditional 401k, and a Roth 401k) and I'm contributing 8% of my paycheck to each.

The education loan has a 6.6% interest rate with a current balance of $18,732.99. I was wondering if I should cut back to 4% for each bucket (or even 2%) and redirect that money into my loans instead.

Adjusting that to

 | | |
-|-|-
Proposed Monthly Loan Payment:|$900
# of Months:|23
Proposed Retirement Deduction:|$279.69|4%/4%/4%

While writing this out it made me think, maybe I could keep the pre-tax contribution at the max 8% while dropping the other two to 4% for a 8/4/4 split, adjusting the loan payment to 800.

personalfinance,Insufficient equity to refinance rental home,"My in-laws rent out their previous home because they couldn't sell it. They have a 30-year FHA Conventional at 6.625% interest with 23 years left and $105k in principal remaining. I suggested they refinance for 15 years at 3.25%. I wasn't aware, and their bank didn't inform them, of the implications for a rental property: you'll pay a higher interest rate (0.5% higher), higher closing fees, and there are greater equity requirements (75% LTV). 

The home appraised for $131k so the bank is asking them for $9k to close. They don't have $9k, but obviously over the next 23 years, refinancing to a 15-year or 20-year loan, without PMI, at a lower interest rate, would save lots of money. **What are some ways to get past the cash required for closing?**",finance,1416582400

I'm torn here.  I'm currently working on paying off credit card debt and getting things back on track.  I've been following alot of the advice I see on here, and have managed to get to the point where I'm starting to build a solid emergency fund, and get off the paycheck to paycheck cycle.  I'm not there yet, but I'm rapidly gaining ground.  The relevant numbers are listed below:

Current CC card debt between all cards: ($4870.80)
I'm using the waterfall method to pay these off, putting about $200 towards the highest interest rate card, and paying the minimums on the others.  Aiming for a payoff in about 24 months at the current rate.

Given that the holidays are coming up, and that I just moved across the country, I've got this ""impulse"" buy on my mind, and was looking for some opinions.  I ""gifted"" my TV to my parents when I relocated for a new job, as it wouldn't fit in my car, and I figured I could just buy a new one down the road.  

Well, Black Friday is here, and unfortunately, I did not budget for this expense.  There are some great deals out there, and I'm considering acquiring ~$300 in debt for a nice, name brand LED TV.  This would be paid off over the next 3 months, in addition to the $200 payment I've been making towards my other cards.  I'd be saving about $120 compared to the normal ""non-black friday"" price of the TV, which in my mind offsets the interest accrued during that period on the purchase.

My federal returns were filed on time.  

I have been using the same CPA for the past 8 years or so.  I usually send all the my papers (W2,1099, charity donation receipts etc.) in March and they send it back after tax filing  few days after April 15th. They never sent it back this year and I did not worry about it because I have all the soft copies that I downloaded from my employer/ bank / brokerage etc.  These papers came back only in first week of November. 

 My state tax refund was a very small amount (about 200 $) so I did not notice that it was never deposited to my checking account.  It was only deposited on Monday.  When I enquired my CPA why it took this long to for the state to issue my refund, the lady who answered the email upon investigation tells me that my state tax returns was only filed in first week of Nov.  She further tells me that this has never happened before and she does not know why it was not filed until now. 

This is what I think happened.  They totally forgot to complete my tax return. They filed my Federal and forgot to file my state tax returns. Some one noticed that my tax filing was not complete then filed my state tax and sent my papers back. I think they were hoping that I would not notice. 

What infuriates the most is, they told me that I do not have to worry as I don’t owe sate anything so I can file late.  When I enquired why they sent my papers back only in November, she told me she did not know who sent and why it was sent late.  The address label was hand written, so I know someone (a person, not a computer) mailed it.

What are the consequences of filing State of Michigan returns late?

The car loan was the biggest payment that would make the deal work.""   I was trying to get a larger HELOC to get the lowered rate, so this is apparently what the did (without telling me until now).

Here is his latest email on how they are trying to 'fix' it:

""Assuming that there is no way around the payoff of XXXCar Loan CompanyXX for the car loan, here is what I would want to do.
 
1)      Get this paperwork sent in as is, and XXBankXX will pay off the car loan.  We will simply send a check to XXCar Loan CompanyXX for the balance of the vehicle and then XXCar Loan CompanyXX will provide you with the title to the vehicle.  At that point in time there would be no lien on the vehicle because you would have the car wrapped up in your home equity.

2)      After everything is paid we’ll input a “cash out” refinance for a vehicle that you would then own free and clear.

a.       This is something that a lot of people do for debt consolidation purposes.  If someone owns their car free and clear but has 10K in credit card debt then we can slap a lien on the vehicle and lower the interest rate that you’re paying.  It’s just about leveraging the debt in a different way.

3)      At that point you’ll have 17K-ish in your checking account that we would just move over to the equity line and you are then at a zero balance on the equity line again and you’re just moving the debt for the car to XXBankXX.

 
What was a simple deal seems to have become WAY more complicated than it needs to be, through no fault of yours though.  I’m going to take care of you in any way that I can on the car loan to ensure that we get you the best possible deal that is either better than or equal to what you currently have.
 
Just let me know what you think.  Email me back with the rate and any questions you would have.""

I've been doing things like this: Every month I pay $100+ on one of the 6.5% student loans on top of my normal monthly payment, and I put $100 into my savings account. Every few months, if my checking account is above $2500, I put the amount above that into savings. Once or twice a year, I pay $1000+ into one of the high-interest loans. I pay the minimum on the medical bills and very slightly more than minimum on the other student loans. This method has me down to four loans from seven, so it's working well enough so far.

**QUESTIONS:**

Medicaid: Can I apply for medicaid while on my fathers insurance? Will medicaid help more than my current insurance? How do I go about applying for medicaid? through Colorado or the Fed?

Disability: What does this mean? can I get a paycheck to keep me afloat when my medical emergencies make me lose my job? Will it draw from my Social Security? IDK how to go about getting classified as disabled. any advice welcome.

CHIP: what is this? some form of medicaid? 

Further Reading: please point me to anything worth reading. I have no idea where to start, there are so many things that can help me, but I feel overwhelmed and mis-informed. I need direction.",finance,1416609507
investing,BND,"I keep hearing about how BND is not worth it because of low interest rates. I also hear that once interest rates rise the value of the fund will fall? But on the other hand I hear that it is an excellent fund to hold in case of a stock crash because it is a flight to safety fund. 

Is BND still good for 20% - 30% of a retirement allocation? (I am in 30s)

Is it an acceptable choice for a brokerage account as a place to park savings toward future expenses and earn a safe(ish)few percent?

He will be graduating with an industrial engineering tech degree and I will graduate law school next December (2015). We're  talking about our financial life but don't know what to prioritize. 

I will have $132k in student loan debt. $32000 from Chase (3.4% and 8.2%) and the rest from federal loans (3.4%-8%). We don't have any other debt.

His 529 pays all our bills except my phone bill (80 a month).

personalfinance,Is there a threshhold amount of debt that is not worth paying off in favor of making other investments? (plus a bonus whiny autobiography),"Alright, here is my story.  I got a little carried away writing it, so if you just want to read pure numbers, you can skip to the horizontal rule about 2/3rds through this post.

At 18, I got into a really, really good art school.  I was very, very inexperienced at art (I still have no idea why they let me in) but I figured, what the hell, it's a great school, right?  They will teach me to do the art.  It is a great opportunity.  I failed out after 2 years.  Everything was federal loans, so this was a mistake but it was not so bad.

I decided I'd failed out because I was really meant to work in animation, digital art, or videogames, and they didn't have either of those things my school, so I switched to an expensive private college that happened to have it.  It wasn't one of those ""for profit"" placse, it was a legit (and pretty good) art school.  Just expensive.

Anyway, to go there, I had to take out $37k/yr in private loans from Sallie Mae.  I know I was a dumbass.  I regret it, but I also don't blame myself too much... honestly, I grew up poor, and I just had no concept of money.  I figured, that's how much it costs, so, that must be what everybody else is doing.  My parents (also being poor) didn't really know anything either and just figured I was following my dreams, and it was good that I was going to college.  It wasn't till later that I learned that I was paying twice the average *total* debt from a bachelor's degree per year.

So I stayed there for two years, and again, it didn't work out.  The realization started to hit how much I was paying, and I looked realistically at the job market for what I was doing, and got really depressed.  I went home for a year, worked and took some serious, non-art classes at my local college to figure out what I wanted to do.  I was still on Sallie Mae because, after failing two schools, they were the only people who'd still give me money.  At this point I was really scared about the money but I was in too deep, I wasn't about to drop out with $90k in loans and nothing to show for it.

I actually ended up making a good decision.  I discovered out I had talent- actually, quite a lot of talent- at math and physics.  It took starting over, this time on federal loans and a couple small scholarships, but after four years, I finished my bachelor's.  Double major in math and physics, magna cum laude, three original research, first-authored publications in top journals (even one paper in a mediocre journal is rare as an undergrad).  I had become well-known in my field as a rising star.  I got admitted to a prestigious grad school (very good for my field) on a full fellowship, which is where I'm at now.  I'm doing real good.  My friends, high school cohort, extended family, they all want their kids to grow up like me.

Except nobody knows about my debt from the first 5 years.  *(NOTE: What follows is a rant; again, if you don't want to hear self-pitying bullshit, skip ahead to the line.)*  I am something like $180k in the hole and it's a huge secret.  I don't buy *anything*.  I don't see movies, I don't have a phone, I don't have a car.  This laptop is 8 years old.  All the other grad students have iPhones, and think the $16k grad student pay is low, but not bad.  I feel undesirable because of the financial burden I'd bring to a marriage.  How could I ever even own a house?  I'm turning 30 soon- people talk about traveling while you're young, and I want *so* badly to do that... but with what money?

The worst part about this secret is that it is starting to take a psychological toll at work... I have to teach this required gen-ed course, which is useless to most people taking it.  It wastes their time, but more importantly, I know my school is not cheap.  I know every lecture I give costs them hundreds.  Every symbol I write is another dollar.  I look out at the 900 students in the lecture hall and see the university sucking money out of each of them like a fat mosquito.  If students complain- why do we have to know this, we're english majors, we don't like it and we'll never use it- I can't answer.  It's because the university wants more of their money, and I want to keep my fellowship, so I have to comply.  I am an accomplice to their exploitation.  I steal their money.  They're promised intelligence and culture, and what they get is exploitation.  I feel like I am the bad guy, now.  It's fucked... I know it won't as bad for most people, but because of how much *my* debt affects *me*, I am developing this huge, accumulating guilt.

***

Anyway...

The federal loans aren't too bad from my first two years and my last four.  Total is around 70 or 80k, which is a lot, but they are low interest, most are deferred till after the PhD, and there are some options I am looking at for partial forgiveness, not the least of which is a prospect research job in government (which I would be interested in anyway) that has decently lucrative federal loan forgiveness benefits.  So I think that part would be handlable.
 
The problem is the $90k+ from my idiot middle three years.  The interest is not small and it is not even deferred.

There is just so much.  It's like I would have to buy three houses just to have 0 dollars in the bank.

OK, so, if I understand correctly, there is a law that forgives alll student loans, public or private, 20 years after they become active; moreover, in the meantime, the minimum amount that I can pay is 15% of my salary.  If these are indeed the rules of the game, it would seem that there is a threshhold amount of debt after which it is not longer worthwhile to pay it at all.   The money beyond the 15% minimum might be better used on other investments that promise a greater rate of return.  In other words, supposing for the purposes of easy numbers that I landed a 100k/yr job, maybe it would be better to pretend it was an 85k/yr job, buy stock or apartment buildings, and have the remaining debt + interest erased after 20 years, than to put as much money as possible towards the loans, then end up with a nothing but a non-garnished salary after 5+ years.  Does what I'm saying make sense?  If not, are the numbers just wrong, or do I have a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation?",finance,1416619007
personalfinance,"First time financing a vehicle, strongly suspect something illegal is happening, please help me PF!","OK, just an advanced warning this will be a good ol' fashioned brick of text.

Pretty generic situation leading up to the decision to purchase, old vehicle on its last legs, yadda yadda yadda. In a used car lot near my home (MN, if it matters) i find a vehicle that i want. A used smaller SUV. i decide to purchase it for $5,400, putting $1,000 down and financing the remainder. i fill out the credit app and wait to hear back. at this point i should mention that while i do not have bad credit (mid 600's if memory serves) i do have a very short credit history. 



  i hear back from the dealership the next buisness day saying that my credit application has been denied on account of the short history and they recommend that i try with a co-signer. That phone call took place at about 11 AM this past Monday (the 17th). i spent the day kind of feeling sorry for myself as i really didn't have a definitive plan B. Then, at about 6:30 or so that night, i get a phone call from a man telling me he was reviewing my credit application and thinks that we can make something work. I was a little taken aback because i was not expecting his phone call in the least. Now, he starts in asking me to verify my SSN by rattling it off which instantly sent off red flags in my head, so i do some basic security measures, tell him i will call him back after briefly researching the company he is with on the internet, making sure phone numbers match, asking him to verify several other peices of information on my credit application, etc. I determine that he is who he says he is, and the conversation continues. 



  i tell him that if need be i can put down a higher down payment if it would sweeten the pot for any financial institutions he speaks to on my behalf, to a total of $1,600. Next is where things get shady, he says that due to me being a very high risk individual for a bank to lend to (23, male, short credit history), that there would be a ""three letter ""F"" word involved that would be applied to the principle of the loan"". he was very particular with his wording, would not come out and say the word ""Fee"" (he did say that any types of ""fees"" of that nature were in fact, illegal) but he made it very clear that if i was going to be financed, it would add $300 to the price of the vehicle, in order to entice the financial institution. now, at this point im pretty sure something sketchy is happening, but i decide to see what he can do for me. A day goes buy and he says he found a credit union that will finance me, and at an interest rate of 2.74%. again, this seems wrong as i would expect to pay a much higher rate based on issues with my credit history, but again, i decide to see where this goes. 



  so the next day, i go down to his office where he has a contract printed up and waiting for me, and he tells me to go ahead and sign it so we can get everything taken care of. i make it very clear at this point that i am not going to sign anything until i have read it over and he starts being a classic used car salesman, trying to make me feel shitty for wanting to read it, trying to hurry me up, the works. any way, i start looking into the contract and lo and behold, there is a $1,600 warranty that i did not talk about or agree to. i tell him that this was unacceptable and to do the paperwork again. cue more salesman tactics, complaining that i just cost him $2 in paper (yes, really...) and i tell him to roll it into the principle of the loan if he wants. he laughs and goes back to his desk. now, at this point he starts in on me heavily implying that if i did not purchase a warranty on the vehicle, it would change the situation for the credit union and they would likely pull my financing. 



  he never came out and said in plain english ""you are required by the credit union to buy a warranty with this vehicle"" but like i said, he tried very hard to make it seem as if me getting financing from this institution was dependent on my buying a warranty and rolling it into the loan. so he tries to sell me on a $900 warranty, i tell him that no, that will also be unacceptable, and he says that he needs to call the credit union and speak with the loan officer that he is dealing with there. he is waiting for a call back that does not come, and he comes at me again with a $600 warranty. now, just to be clear, the office that i am at is NOT the dealership where the vehicle in question is located, and it is getting late in the day, approaching time that the dealership would be closing. so, to be done with the hassle i signed the contract (which, true to what he said, was indeed a 2.5 year loan @ 2.74% interest) and moved on to the other paperwork. 



  now i am signing some other generic forms, when i come across my credit application where some information is incorrect. my rent payment shown on the application is half of what i put down when i filled it out initially at the dealership, showing $250, NOT $500 that i listed. also, it shows me as making about $1300 per month, NOT $1300 per check (bi-weekly) that i had written down at the dealership a few days previous. this confused me because not only did he verify my take home pay when we spoke on the phone initially, but he also took a photo copy of a paystub that i brought in. i told him that the information on the credit application was wrong, and he told me that it didnt matter. this is the part where i think i fucked up, i signed it. also, when i left this was NOT one of the pieces of paper that i got a copy of, but he assured me that he would email me a photo copy of it. that whole encounter happened the day before yesterday, which was a Wednesday. the next day at work, i am pretty  sketched out over the $600 warranty thing, so i decide to call the credit union that he hooked me up with as a financing institution. 



  i spoke with a loan officer there and he told me that they do not look at a warranty on the vehicle as being a factor in the slightest, and even confirmed it with his manager. furthermore, he told me that they would be able to refund the warranty and that i should not have to re-sign any paperwork. splendid. so now i have it confirmed that this greasy asshole took me for a $600 dollar ride. this will not stand man, this aggression will not stand. when i got off of work yesterday, i went back down to the office and told the individual that i needed to speak with him. we sit down, and i tell him that i dont feel that he has been honest with me about the warranty, and recap the conversation i had with the loan officer at the financial institution. at this point, he pretty much blew his fuckin' top. 



  he starts yelling, literally yelling, at me saying that i am trash talking him, that i better not have ""fucked up his relationship with the dealership or the credit union"", telling me that i am only thinking about myself, and that i am being selfish, and a whole lot of other smoke, including telling me that he is going to ""kill the deal"". i tell him that no, i believe we both signed that contract and i would still like the vehicle, i just want a refund for the $600 warranty that is not needed. again, more pouting, more guilt tripping, doing everything he can to not have that happen. at this point i start dealing with a different salesman, who i believe may be the superior of the diva hosting his very own pity-party. he prints up another contract showing me a reduced monthly payment, and to just sign it. several times, he tries to get me to sign it without reading it. i tell him that no, i will not be signing any new contracts, i just want my refund. 



  he too tries persuade me out of it, while i just smile politely and nod, waiting for him to finish. eventually, he gets it that i am not to be persuaded by his line of bullshit, and he types up a piece of paper that basically states, that i purchased the specified vehicle and would like the warranty refunded, understanding that it is in an ""as is"" condition and all the like, and that the company will be cutting a check to the credit union in the sum of $600, and from there they will deduct it from the principal of the loan. we both sign and date that piece of paper, which i currently have a copy of. 




  phew. sorry that got a little lengthy, but i had to throw a little justice porn in there towards the end. anyway, basically i have a bad feeling that my dealings with these people are not over and am wondering if i should proceed in any certain manner going forward. when i spoke to the credit union they said that they did not have the contract yet but were aware that i was in the process of financing, and that they will be looking over the loan just to confirm details of it, and i am wondering if A) there is anything that this greasy dude can do at this point in the proceedings to fuck up the deal with the vehicle, and B) if i should be concerned about the credit union rejecting my application that has the incorrect information on it. which i still do not have a copy of, both the grease ball and his superior told me that they would email me a photocopy of it that i have still not received at this point. if anyone has any advice or tips on how to proceed i would sure appreciate it!

personalfinance,Buying my first place. Yay or nay? (Australia),"So I am nearly 21 and I have been working in my chosen field since March of this year. I scored an entry-level role and then transferred to where I live now in order to take on a promotion. I am currently working a 4 day week with the intention of beginning a bachelors next year, which I will do on weekends and the one weekday I have off.

I am currently renting on my own. I pay $720 per month in rent for a 2 bedroom unit. It is a complete fluke that I found this place at this price. I am at the beginning of my lease so I have no idea what they are going to do with the prices in 12 months' time. It has the potential to go up. A lot. (This place is probably worth more like $840 per month).

Anyways, the company I work for (financial institution) offers a lot of banking-related staff benefits. One of them being that you can take out a mortgage without LMI (lender's mortgage insurance) with only a 10% deposit instead of the usual 20%.

I estimate that in 18-24 months' time (maybe sooner if I really get into it) I will have enough to put a 10% deposit down on a $200k place. Which in my area will buy you a 2 bedroom unit/apartment type thing in a reasonably good area.

Do you think it would be in my best interests to buy?

My current financials are:

(Monthly) 

Income: $2528

* Rent: $720
* Electricity: $100?
* Phone/Internet: $139
* Food/Household: $400
* Contents Insurance: $20
* Health Insurance $60
* Car-related: $200
* Personal Spending: $400*


* Total Expenses = $2039
* Left Over = $489

(Electricity will probably be way less than that, but I have overestimated it for now because I haven't got a bill yet so I have no idea what it actually is. Personal Spending includes everything from clothes, medication, entertainment, petrol for my car, etc. I am working on getting this down and figuring out what I actually need).

I already have saved

* $10k Emergency Fund
* $2500 towards a downpayment

I am expecting to come into a little bit of money for my 21st birthday, which is in about a month. I also have the ability to earn bonuses at work. I will be trying to cut back on my spending as much as possible in order to reach my savings goal ASAP.

I just ran a quick calculation, and the approximate repayments on a $180k mortgage over 30 years is $892 per month. Which is around 35% of my current income. (Calculated on interest rate of 5%)

To me, 35% is a little higher than I would like, and I would really like to try and get a much cheaper place than $200k. I would be completely open to buying a 1 bedroom place, but they are few and far between in my neck of the woods. I will have to wait and see what is realistically available. $200k is the higher end of the scale.

My rent may very well go up to the same amount as a mortgage. Downsizing my rental is definitely an option but once again anything smaller/crappier than what I am in already is few and far between. 

I am planning to study a Bachelor of Commerce with a major in Finance, which directly relates to my current job/company, which I plan to stay and progress  with. The opportunities are like none other. The place that I currently live is where I want to stay (I've always wanted to live here). So I don't think that lack of stability is an issue for me.

The country we're in doesn't tax capital gain. The interest rate is about 0.5-2.0%. The discount on stock is counted as employee's compensation and is taxable. She's in the mid of the income tax bracket so taking the stock discount won't bump her to the higher tax bracket.

personalfinance,Post Graduate twentysome with 2k net worth and debt looking for advice.,"With a networth of about 2k and a degree under my belt, I would imagine I am at the dead center of the current post collegiate spread. At the moment I have a total student loan debt of 8k, but a graduate windfall has pushed my savings to a level where I could pay off the total of my loans. I may be moving in the spring, so what would be the best use of my money? 


With about 10k spread between savings and checking accounts, and an 8k loan with a 4.5% interest rate, what should a twentysome with no retirement fund do? Is it reasonable to open a Roth IRA and put away some money now and start a 3 fund portfolio, or is the better move to keep my capital open for unforeseen future disasters. I know this sub values emergency funds, but is it worth it to start investing in the face of uncertainty. 


In terms of income I work several jobs weekly that do not amount to my career choice (but I do have an unpaid internship that is slowly progressing me to that point) that would put me solidly at the 18k a year range. With regular expenses at about 1k a month, which include student loan payments, is it reasonable to attempt to start a retirement portfolio, knowing that the most I can put down is a few thousand each year, or is my current situation more suited for a readily available cash reservoir.  


As a very recent college graduate I am a bit frustrated as I struggle to find employment where my passion is. While I did not know everyone that graduated with from my college, I do happen to see when my classmates begin to gloat over their newly secured positions, but I’ve also seen terribly driven individuals who have now become trapped in a debt prison. 



TLDR: 
Should I pay off all my debt now or take advantage of the relatively low federal loan interest rate to keep my money open in order to invest/have an emergency fund. Also I may be moving in Spring.

technology,Here's an Idea. (Net Neutrality),"Good Evening Everyone,

We tried to make change with demonstrations, but change did not come. We live in an age of technology, and technology brings instant gratification to our young minds. The more effort a project requires, the less people will participate. When a project takes a substantial amount of time to make change, people will most likely lose interest.

If we want to undertake a project to create change, we must focus a few things:

* Making it easy to get involved and stay involved.
* Creating a self-sustainable platform.
* Keeping the costs low.

I've had multiple ideas since RestoreTheFourth to stay politically involved, one of which being Municipal Fiber (working title).

The concept of the idea is to have an interactive website that will allow individuals to lobby all levels of government and begin the roll out of municipality owned fiber. There are several features that need to be implemented to help us with the three goals I outlined above.

* An interactive map that allows individuals to find representatives at a city, county, state, and federal level. The map will also allow people to see and understand laws regarding municipal fiber in their area.

* A platform to digitally show support for our endeavors (rolling out municipal fiber across the United States). We can facilitate the creation of petitions, email representatives, and in the future mail physical letters on behalf of the people.

* A complete guide showing how to and the benefits of rolling out municipal fiber. From petitioning and lobbying local government to a guide for the local elected representatives to put a plan into action. We need to be able to clearly show the benefits, the costs, the necessity, and the plan of action. Many communities (http://www.muninetworks.org/communitymap) have accomplished a municipal network, so let's collaborate and share a list of best practices.

You can see a concept of the website here: http://kobolsolutions.com/municipalfiber/

In order to put this plan in to action, I need talented individuals willing to collaborate and get things accomplished.

* Research Hounds
* Writers

Over time slowly raised my insurance deductibles, taking the cash I saved and rolling it in to the deductibles savings account.  I am now sitting on about 5K in a low yield (0.75%) savings account to cover my deductibles in case of an emergency and have the highest deductibles on all my insured property.  This lets me keep my money and still be covered.

I am looking to get a higher return on this money and want to put it in to a slightly higher yield, but still liquid investment.  I have not needed to dip in to this account in the past 10 years due to no insurance claims.

Which is better and how do I do the math to evaluate whether to put the cash in to a 5 year CD at 2.25% or ladder it out?

Bitcoin,Banks are stealing from you and you should buy crypto currency now urgently...,"...the end game is here and most accountants, lawyers, economists and business men know that printing money (QE) is a slippery slope and doing it for over seven years is fundamentally over the tipping point.  Mid term elections proved change is in the air.  The printing has outrageously skewed the free market price discovery of interest rates, housing prices, stocks and bond prices.  The fed chairwoman Janet Yellen announced Oct 30 2014 that the US had stopped QE3 only to have Japan announce the next day that they would take over the printing by three times per capita of what the US was doing.  The bankers (China) don't like it when you pay your debts with printed money so they most likely ask for consideration like having those banks who get the printed money to short gold so China can buy it cheap to use it as a new gold backed currency.  Happens that the Swiss people vote via referendum next week Nov 30th to back their currency with gold.  Someone is holding a long position in silver taking a huge daily loss (adding in the billions of dollars) against those shorts maybe in order to hold a trigger as calling for delivery of the metal which is impossible because there are 100/1 ratio of paper to physical.  Many of those longs expire this December and if that entity were to call for delivery it would put the silver trade in default which would put a run on gold putting it in default that would put many hedge funds in default that would put all major banks in default. China is putting themselves in a great position to be a big part of the new global reserve currency.  This would be the end game and alternative computational trust currencies will look real good!  I give this a 15% chance to happen in December 2014 a 30% chance by spring a 75% chance by September 2015 and a 85% chance by October 2015.

personalfinance,Understanding bond risk.,"I""m trying to understand bond markets and what makes them risky. Most of the risk with bonds make sense to me (inflation could outpace the rate of return, the issuer could default etc..) The one thing I see that I don't understand, is the interest rate risk.

The idea being, interest rates rise, so bonds with higher returns enter the market, making your bond less valuable.  What I don't get is, if you sit the bond out to maturity, you still get it's face value back right? You still get all the money you put in, plus interest. In this case, interest rate rise, doesn't seem so much a risk as a missed opportunity to make more elsewhere. 

That's fine with me, the way I see it, that will always be the case, there is always going to be an investment elsewhere that could have made you more money. If a bond is a promise to pay back initial capital (barring default) plus some rate of return, then interest rate increase doesn't seem like a risk at all.

Do I understand this correctly? Can you loose an initial investment in a bond if interest rates rise?",finance,1416767541

##Retirement Accounts

I have $28,863.41 in a Rollover IRA at Vanguard. I just rolled it over from my old company's shitty 401K plan at Principal. It's currently in Vanguard's Target Retirement 2050 fund, but I want to look into splitting that up on my own to create a custom 3-fund portfolio. I am not actively contributing to this account.

I have $22,954.09 in a Principal 401K for my current employer. I am only contributing up to their 6% match for this account. It's currently invested in the Principal Trust(SM) Target 2050 Fund, which has a stupid-high ER of 0.80%. My options are very limited when it comes to re-allocating this due to the plan that I am in with my company.

##The Plan

1. We're moving to a different state in August. This is where all of my ""spare"" money is going at the moment - saving for the move. We're thinking $8,000 to cover the cost of the movers, 1st month rent, and an apartment scouting trip in June/July (the airfare will be free thanks to airline points). We definitely hope that the move will cost us less than $8,000. If it does, it will be rolled into step 2. On a side note, we hope find a cheaper apartment when we move as well.
2. Pay off my student loans in the following order: 6, 5, 10, 9, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 1. The wife is paying off her loans from her job. This is the only item that I don't have on my budget because she is taking care of it.

I'm sort of playing the rest by ear at the moment. I may start to max out my IRA contributions after I get rid of the 6.x% loans. I also have the car lease that is up in January 2016 to think about - if we want to save up to buy/finance that, or if I want to look into other options.

So, reddit, I'm all ears. I have no real specific questions, just looking for a bit of a sanity check here. Any advice or critiques are welcome.",finance,1416768208

Hope this brings more insight.  Take home bi weekly is 1300 after taxes, health, and dental. My company will match my 401k after december so i will put as much as they can match then when i find out. Loans all have an expected pay time of 2024 . The way my cash flow works is that im able to put atleast 200 per paycheck into my savings. I also have stopped using my card and will utilize that 200 to add into my savings fund. I know i can trim the car after my lease is over and credit debt. Im due for a raise in december as well so this will change some things. Sorry for grammer and layout as i am on a cellphone. Thank you.

EDIT: I know that this wont be happening soon but i am asking for when i do have this cash saved up and my salary increases. As my salary increases i will put more and more money in. Im asking for financial advice more or less.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans vs. saving for a future home purchase.,"Hi! 

So I started a new job 3 months ago and it's going GREAT. I'm 22, graduated college in May, and my base salary at my current job is 32,500/yr. 

My expenses are covered, I'm maxing out my 401k (edit: as in getting the max employer match), plenty of money for rent, etc. I have a little less than 5k in my checking account, I guess as an emergency fund. 

*(My lease is month-to-month, so the worst case financial situation for me would be losing my job and having to move home with my parents, in that case my only monthly expense would be student loans. It would suck but it wouldn't ruin me financially. My emergency fund would allow me time to pay loans while finding a new job. I know health issues can arise as well, but my company provides excellent insurance - $500 deductible/yr. I'm in good health so I don't even expect to reach my deductible).* 

I owe 35,000 in student loans, 4.6% interest rate. Standard 10 yr payment plan, but I'm hoping to pay it off more quickly. This is my only debt. 

At my job, **I'm lined up to make incentives totaling like 7k-8k between Jan and June.** If I keep doing my job well and meet the yearly goal set for employees in my position, I'd make around 29k in incentives over the year. I'm not counting on this, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility. 

**My main financial goals are (1) get rid of student loan debt ASAP. And (2) buy a house before I'm 30.** Small but nice houses in the area I'd like to live cost 200-250k in the current market. 

**My question is, do I pay down my loans as quickly as possible? This is my instinct. But on the other hand, should I put some, or most of the extra income in savings for a future house purchase?**

Yes, I read the sidebar posts.",finance,1416768917

I am a non resident Indian. Currently the banks are offering fixed deposits at 8.5-9% interest rate for 2-10 year term. I believe fixed deposits are equivalent to CD's in USA. They are risk free. Would that be a better option to pursue such high return zero risk investment or is it better to invest in index fund, ETF ?

General consensus on this subreddit seems to be to target 7-8% returns over a long period. Would this be a good way to do it ?

* 12k pre-tax income (wife)
* 12k in emergency fund and 4k cash in hand
* Currently contributing 10% into TSP (Fed matches 5% IFF I stay for 3 years)
* No other investments
* No debt
* Finances are with a credit union (not sure that matters)

I'm not sure what precisely to look for when looking for jobs on the outside. I also am not sure how much I could ask for in salary for a new position, but I am assuming by next June I could comfortably ask for 90k from what I am currently seeing.

I don't know how to approach my finances currently and how much I should be saving vs how much I need to be keeping on hand vs how short-term investing works.

My current concerns for the future:

* New car for my wife
* Down payment for a home
* Hot tub for the new home (priorities are good)
* Saving for future kid(s) college fund
* Being in a situation of being financially independent, but still work if I wanted by age 40, 45, 50, 55, 60

 I'm thinking that I should bump my TSP offering to 15% while I am still in gov't. I'm also not sure if doing all TSP is worth it or not. I've also been looking at how having the TSP in G funds as well as a target date IRA from Vanguard, but don't quite understand the math behind these to evaluate the possibilities.

personalfinance,My parents are 50 and 60. They have no retirement savings to speak of. I am 26. What can I do to start preparing?,"My parents are immigrants to the United States. Both have had difficulties with jobs given their lack of higher education and technical skills. My dad also suffered from a debilitating illness ten years ago and has not worked since. My mom supported a whole family of five on less than $30,000/year + a mix of charity and government assistance.  

Growing up, my siblings and I were all on the Federal free and reduced priced meals program. My sister (22) and I (26) both put ourselves through college and never ask our parents for any monetary help. My brother (14) will very likely need to do the same.  

I know that I will need to care for our parents monetarily once my mom can no longer work. I also hope that my siblings, of course, will be on board as well, to help as much as they are able.  

My question is, how can I begin preparing for this, now? And, what are my options when it comes to supporting them? I ask because I want to know what I'll have to consider in my 30s. As a planner, knowing what's coming up will help me make good decisions now.  

Details That Might be Helpful:

- My parents have been living in the same house for 20 years. It's a 30 year mortgage so it's possible that it'll be completely paid off by the time my mom needs to retire. 
- My parents have no retirement savings. There was never money to spare.
- My parent's insurance, I believe, comes through Medicaid but I'm not sure. 
- I hope to have children in my 30s, so that will be a financial consideration as well. 

*Edit*

Thank you so much for all your comments! It is proving to be SUPER helpful. I've added additional details and a note to answer some general trends.

Additional Details:

- My parents are both US citizens. Both took care of taxes as long as they were working, so I think they should be eligible for SS but will double-check. 
- I am absolutely taking care of my own retirement and financial house. My goal is to be financially independent my whole life. I think of it as my greatest gift to myself.
- I will definitely talk about this with any potential SO. I know that financial disagreements and the related stress are the biggest reasons for marriages breaking up, so I believe that financial compatibility is hugely important. We can never anticipate everything that life will throw at us, but I think that if my SO's values and priorities are aligned with my own, then we can weather any storm. I value maximizing positive relationships and financial freedom over possessions, even if it means living more modestly, so I would my hope SO is the same.
- My parents are probably debt-free (with the exception of the mortgage). While I need to double-check, my mom is the one who taught me to never carry a balance on a credit card, so I don't see her ever taking on debt in other ways. My sister and I are debt-free as well.
- We live across the country from one another. Since the industry I'm in is strongest in my city and my parents' social support structure is in their city, I doubt my parents and I will be moving to the same place any time soon. This does not negate the possibility of my parents moving close to one of the siblings, but it is probably too early for my sister to think about this, yet. I want her to have a similar amount of time that I had to establish her career before she needs to take our parents into consideration. 
- I don't think either my sister or I want the house since our current careers put us in larger cities, but my brother may? He's so young that anything can change for him.

Finally, to the (thankfully) few people who said that this is not my concern:

I could not be where I am today, with a great education and a great career, without my parents, and I know that both my parents made the choice to immigrate because they wanted a better life for themselves and their families. As a result, while it's probably going to be tough to support them later, I am more than happy to make that choice. I also know how to set boundaries so I'm not worried that I'll be taken advantage of. It's more that I'll need to be extra diligent never to let lifestyle inflation get to me and to do my best to make sure my earning potential gets to a level that can support two generations of family members within five years. My sister is probably of the same mind, so I'll be sure to chat with her, while my brother is way to young to think about this. We are family, family that's always helped each other out, and this is what families that help each other do.",finance,1416795654

personalfinance,Recovering Gambling Addict - Need Advice Desperately,"I'm a 28 year old male struggling with gambling addiction for the past few years. I've been going to GA meetings recently, and it's definitely changed my perspective and outlook (I've been suicidal over it before). Because of my gambling, I ended up destroying my relationship and made the difficult decision to move back to my home state to get a fresh start (and to no longer be dependent on anyone but myself). I've had casino slip-ups here and there since moving 6 months ago (always with disastrous results), but I'm exhausted and honestly ready to change my life. 

Through the past few years I ended up racking up about 19k in credit card/personal loan debt, which I was able to consolidate all of it using a debt management program this past May. However, because of my slip ups since then, I scrambled for a solution to cover my losses, and ended up taking out a few online tribal loans, all of which have astronomical interest rates and require payments every two weeks. Here is my monthly breakdown:

Income: 

* $1030 take-home pay every 2 weeks

Monthly Bills:

* $340/mo Rent (my half)
* $468/mo Debt Consolidation payment ($18k balance)
* $204/mo Car Insurance Payment
* $133/mo Student Loan payment ($11k balance)
* $123/mo Cell Phone Payment (t-mo, $750 balance on phone left)
* $20/mo Internet Payment (my half)
* $12/mo Renters Insurance Payment
* $10/mo Planet Fitness Membership

Bills from hell:

* $135/every 2 weeks Tribal Lender Payment 1 ($1085 balance)
* $138/every 2 weeks Tribal Lender Payment 2 ($1331 balance)
* $138/every 2 weeks Tribal Lender Payment 3 ($1000 balance)

Now if you do the math that's $2132/mo, which already exceeds my monthly income, and not including any food, gas, random expenses, etc. I've had a little extra here and there and gotten by, but now with the third tribal loan in the mix and my savings gone, I'm down to the point where I'm going to run out of money each month. 

I'll be getting a small bonus in December (probably 500-1000), and I'm expecting a small tax return next year (probably around 500). 

Obviously I need to be making more money, but what do you guys suggest is the best route? There is plenty of low-wage $10/hr PT jobs out there, but I'm looking for suggestions to rework my situation or what you would think is the ""best"" kind of part time job. Despite what you would think, I'm actually very intelligent and I have a creative mind. It's just been hijacked by addiction that got the best of me.

Also I'm aware the car insurance seems high, but apparently credit score has a lot to do with the rate now, and this is honestly the lowest I can find for acceptable coverage.

tl:dr My gambling addiction got me into so much debt that my minimum payments are more than I make per month. What do you suggest I do to get back on my feet?",finance,1416798784

personalfinance,Car loan cannot improve credit past certain point? (CA). Would appreciate some sage advice...,"Bit of an odd one, this! I presume there's some comparison to the American system, given that we use many of the same banks and have many other similar laws, but if any Canadians can toss me a tip, I'd appreciate it.

I need to cover a little history first!

I had very solid credit in my early 20's (early 2000's) when I was working instead of attending university. I cancelled a credit card on return to university (very poor financial advice that I received) because they were (mid 2000's) still practically giving them away, and I was told it was better to 'avoid temptation' as a full-time student. 

Flash forward to late 2000's, I've finished my university, but because I was away attending a foreign university (Europe) and completely forgot to get mail forwarding, I ended up unintentionally defaulting on a very small student loan (less than $5000) that I had, completely obliterating my credit score. 

The situation now:

I'm in my early 30's, but my work, at present, is on-call only. It pays very well when I work, but pays nothing when I don't, meaning that even though I earn a reasonable income (and have few bills) very few banks will help me rebuild my credit... in fact, none. 

I was 'lucky' and got a car loan in 2012 to help purchase a vehicle, but only because of a very strong co-signer. The loan was for about $10,000 at a god-awful 20% interest rate; I have never missed a payment. I've spent over two years paying an exorbitant monthly sum for a very nice (though older) car. My bank (different bank than the one that gave me the car loan) now tells me that my car loan that I am paying through the nose for cannot improve my credit score any longer. I was told that I had to get 'real' credit (i.e. a credit card) for my score to move 'up', though the bank was honest in telling me that I wouldn't qualify for their card because my score was still too low. I believe my bank, only because they were not trying to 'sell' me anything, and were honest that they themselves were unable to help my credit.

I applied to Capital One just two months ago, and they issued me a card with a moderate limit ($2500) without asking for a secured deposit, so I suppose my credit limit isn't completely awful any longer (yay?). I am grateful to be able to exist in the real world again - life without a credit card made me feel like a child - but I am stuck with a horrible auto loan now that is doing (apparently) nothing for me except costing me money.

Two main questions:

1. Why (or how!) can my ridiculous interest rate car loan no longer really help my credit score? Can someone with financial knowledge explain how this is even remotely possible?

2. What do I do with said ridiculous loan? It has 19 months left on it, and would require approximately $4000 (if I was to pay it off today), a sum that I do not have free (or have at all, really). The nature of my 'boom or bust' on call work means that I cannot make financial decisions too far in advance.

I've been advised to try to find some bank to 'take over' the loan to reduce the interest - is that my only option? My biggest query is why the loan doesn't really help my credit score any longer, or why they would tell me that. Oh, and I love my car and have no desire to get rid of it any time soon... I suppose that's the only positive in this whole mess.

personalfinance,"Take-home pay: what you can expect from your first, entry-level, salaried job after taxes and deductions.","I remember when searching for my first “real” job I really wanted a quick ballpark estimate of what my take-home pay would be, after deductions and taxes. That imaginary salary sure seems nice, but making plans off that figure alone can be deceiving. I don’t think there has been simple breakdown on this subreddit from my cursory search, so here’s an attempt.

Say your salary is $35,000 for your entry level position, and that you’re paid biweekly (every two weeks — your experience may differ, buuut this seems like a good starting point). That means the gross pay for your paycheck will be $1346.15 (35k spread over 26 paychecks).

Deductions and taxes are now taken out, and in that order. Deductions are aka the **benefits** you choose to pay for that get taken out of your paycheck. Commonly they are health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, 401k, transportation. There are more options, but I’ll just focus on these five, as they are the ones that the committee of me deems essential.

*These are estimates*

40.00 - health insurance  
10.00 - dental insurance  
5.00 - vision insurance  
53.86 - 401k at 4% (opt to use it! though you can vary your number)  
56.00 - transportation (price of a metrocard in nyc, divided by two. could be for your parking lot or someother)  
164.86 - TOTAL per paycheck

So the income you’ll be taxed for will be $1181.29 (the 1346.15 gross - 164.86 deductions above). That’s the good thing about using your benefits; it’s like telling the government you make less than you actually make so that you’ll be taxed at a lower income, while still getting the perks (really spelling this out).

In this income bracket, you are roughly, roughly taxed at a 20% rate. Again I’m not an expert, and I’m SURE it differs from state to state and from personal situation to personal situation (like if you’re married or something), but this is to give you an idea. You can further break down what that percentage consists of (federal income tax / social security / medicare / state tax / special tax if you live in nyc) but we’ll say 20% for now.

So 1181.29 - 20% tax = **$945.03 NET**

That is the figure you can expect to take home every other week on a salary of 35k. Not bad. But certainly not the $1346.15 gross you started out with. A reminder that in this scenario, you are covered with insurance, you are squirreling away 4% of your income for the future (that is being matched to some extent by your employer — free money!!), and that your transportation expenses are covered. No small thing.

To extrapolate that to yearly income, it’s $35,000 - 1040 (H) - 260 (D) - 130 (V) - 1400 (401) - 1344 (T) = 30826 - 20% tax = **$24,660.80 annual**

Some reminders:

* likely there are different ‘tiers’ of health / dental / vision insurance you can purchase, but the pricing relative to one another i believe is accurate (health costs the most, vision is peculiarly inexpensive). and that is a whole other nightmare post about what that insurance covers and doesn’t cover, what a co-pay is, etc. …making me angry just thinking about it.
* use your 401k. that’s what everyone smart about money seems to say. if, suppose, your employer “matches at a 50% rate up to 4%” that means for the $1400 annually you’re squirreling away to the fund you can’t touch, your employer will give you $700. it’s free money, and it adds up over time.
* on a biweekly system like the one i outlined here, two months out of the year will be three-paycheck months (hooray!), since twelve doesn’t easily break into 26. this makes the math on doing a “monthly” income tricky, which is why you just break it down either paycheck by paycheck or annually. anyway, those months are great.
* on those three-paycheck months, the third paycheck won’t have your transportation deducted from it since they commonly just divide the monthly cost of your metrocard / parking pass by two. so that third paycheck is a little fatter.
* speaking of which, it’s worth it to use your transportation benefits. here’s the math quickly: if you opt not to use it, and buy on your own twelve $112 metrocards over the course of a year, that’s $269 you’re losing to the government in paying taxes on your “higher income”

**TL;DR:** $35,000 entry level job salary -&gt; twenty-six $945.03 net paychecks over the course of a year.

personalfinance,Windfall - apply to mortgage or emergency fund?,"Hello r/personalfinance,

My wife and I just did a no-cash-out refinance of our house to get rid of PMI and get a lower interest rate. As part of the process, we discovered we had been dramatically overpaying into the escrow account. We're going to get about $5000 back when all the accounts are settled. 

Applying the $5000 to the mortgage principal would save us about $3000 in interest over the life of the new mortgage. But we don't yet have a full 3 months of expenses in our emergency fund, and $5000 would get us there. 

I would love to have a 3 month emergency fund by next month, but the opportunity cost is not saving $3000 in interest on the mortgage. 

Thoughts?

EDIT: Ok, thanks. Since the money was coming out of the refinance, I got stuck on the idea of applying the money to the mortgage principal. I'll put it in the emergency fund instead.",finance,1416850917

personalfinance,"Article: ""Westlake man has one of the highest credit scores in the entire country, 848 out of 850""","This was an old article from 2012, but it demonstrates how living within your means and having a solid, long-standing history of on-time payments can affect your score. I found it to be quite informative:

http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2012/10/westlake_man_has_one_of_the_hi.html

From the article:

&gt; [...] anybody can live beyond his means. They don't. He has a few simple rules:
  
&gt; 1. **Never charge something without having something to show for it.**  

&gt; 2. **Never spend money without knowing when you can repay it.**  

&gt; 3. **Pay your bills on time.** 

&gt; [...]

&gt; In fact, the Pavelkas have [...] four credit cards with amounts due this month **(they pay the bills in full each month)**

It's clear from the article that, while not exactly ""frugal"", this couple lives their lifestyle very carefully.

In addition, the article also has a few tips from Fair Isaac (FICO):

&gt; Fair Isaac Corp. calls people with a credit score of 785 or greater a ""high achiever."" Here are some of the characteristics of high achievers:

&gt; * They have an average of seven credit cards including both open and closed accounts.  
&gt; * They have an average of four credit cards or loans with balances.
One-third of high achievers have total balances of more than $8,500 on *non-mortgage* accounts; the remaining two-thirds have *total balances of less than $8,500.*  
&gt; * 96 percent of high achievers show no missed payments anywhere on their credit report.  
&gt; * They seldom open new accounts. Their oldest credit account was opened an average of 25 years ago and their most recently opened credit account averages was 28 months ago. Overall, their average credit account is 11 years old.

Keep in mind that these are simply averages, and might not represent the ideal credit file. However, here are some main takeaways from this article that I like to reiterate to people looking to improve their position from a credit standpoint:

* You can maintain a great credit score by paying in full every month. You do not need to pay interest for a high score.  
* Keep your debt burden low, and live within your means. This means using credit *only for planned expenses that you can otherwise pay off in cash.* Exceptions might include student loans, car financing, or mortgages.  
* Past a certain point, obtaining low interest rates on new loans doesn't scale with score. From the article: ""FICO scores (the best known and the ones lenders generally use) run from 300 to 850. Anything above 720 is an A.""",finance,1416857400

personalfinance,About to graduate medical school with $250 000 debt and I'm freaking out.,"I began my University life in Canada straight out of high school where I finished a four year degree then went to Eastern Europe for a six year medical degree. In the spring I will graduate with about $250 000 debt.
I currently have 2 loans:  
$100 000 student loan to Canadian Government (split between provincial and federal) of which I currently pay no interest. After I graduate I have six months before I must begin baying it back at something around 5% interest.  
$150 000 student line of credit with Royal Bank of Canada. I have been paying 4.4% interest since it began.  
Once I graduate I will be moving to Norway to work. My girlfriend graduated from the same school two years ago and has had been working ever since. She is currently making what would be equivalent to $80 000 after tax. She has a student loan of about $75 000 at 2.5% interest and a mortgage of $200 000 at 3.5% and about $20 000 savings.
I hope to be making about the same as her shortly after graduating.  
I know nothing about finances and savings and mortgages and all that jazz. I kind of just assumed that medical school (or school in general) is ridiculously expensive and in the end everything will work itself out. Lately, I have been worried that this may not be the case.  
I am just now discovering this subreddit and hoping that someone more knowledgeable than me can either calm my nerves or prepare me for what is to come. My girlfriend keeps telling me not to stress about it but lately I'm finding that to be very difficult.  
Would love to hear what someone else has to say and how to prepare myself for what is to come.

personalfinance,I've made some stupid financial decisions in the past 5 years that have left me no other decision but to move in with the In-Laws.,"As a fairly newly wed couple, the wife and I decided to buy a house that we could both afford with our combined income.  We both wanted kids and agreed that we would keep our kid in day care while we both worked when the time came to start reproducing.  Fast forward 5 years and we now have a child on the way (kind of unexpected).  After really discussing our financial situation we both have come to the realization that we can not afford day care and keep our house at the same time.  Plus the wife has decided that she no longer wants to keep her current job because she is unhappy with it and wants to change jobs and drop down to part-time after giving birth.  So...we've decided to sell the house as there is no other alternative option.  Turns out we are 18K underwater on our house so we are clearing out our entire savings account and a using a few thousand from an IRA just to get out of the house at closing.  So now...we have nothing in savings and no financial cushion.  Instead of buying a less expensive house and focusing on paying off debt we went in over our heads and decided to ""live it up"" for the five years we stayed here.  Now...it's time to pay the piper...

I make 58K a year.  OK for a single 31 year old guy but stretching it thin for a family of three.  We could move into an apartment immediately but at my price point ($400) we would have to move into the ""hood"".  I want to avoid this at all costs though.  Her parent's have generously offered us to move in with them (up to a year) allowing us to try and work out a better financial situation.  We are taking them up on the offer and want to put together a plan to pay off some debt and or save to lessen the struggle plus solidify a better living situation.  We would stay with them for about 6 months.  6 months is all I can handle without losing my sanity.  I'm sure its not ideal for the In-Laws too.

During this 6 months, I can accumulate $9K - $10K extra by not having to pay a mortgage and taking into account that my wife will continue to receive pay checks for 3 months while she is on maternity leave.  This also takes into account the added expenses of a baby.  At the end of the 6 months the wife plans to start working again part time and can expect to bring in an extra 1K minimum per month.

Here is my debt situation:

9K - Federal Student Loans $200/month
9K - Private Bank Loans $120/month
8K - Car note $295/month (2009 Altima)
1.5K - Credit Card $120/month

Planning ahead:

Do I buy a home/condo at the end of our stay with the In-Laws or do I use this opportunity to pay off some debt and then move my family into an apartment?

Option #1 (Rent apartment and pay off debt):

If I decide to rent I can use the extra 9K - 10K saved while at the In-Laws to pay off our car note and credit card which would free up about $420 dollars per month.  Or...pay off my Federal Student Loans which would only free up $200 month.  Should I take this opportunity to finally get rid of half my student loans even though it wouldn't free up as much money as paying off the car and credit card?  I really hate looking at those student loans though.

Situation #2 (purchase condo/home):

If I purchase a condo/home I can expect a lower monthly payment vs renting.  With the wife's extra part-time income we could make it work but would still have to live with some debt for a while.  This option I am gravitating towards because I really don't like the idea of renting.

Bonus Option # 2A (extend stay with In-Laws to 1 year instead of 6 months):

My In-Laws are nice people but I feel I am sacrificing my sanity by living with them.  Do I man up and deal with an extra 6 months with the In-Laws?  This would allow me to free up money ($420/month or $200/month) as described in Option 1 plus save enough money (about $6K) for an OK down payment on a condo in my price range.  I realize this option is largely based upon how long I can handle cohabiting with the In-Laws.  Guess I was just leaving this option on the table since 1 year of stay was offered to us.

Maybe these aren't my only options but it is all I can come up with at the moment.  Which option is the best?

personalfinance,"Should I raise my credit limit? Or wait? I want a higher credit score, and my debt percentage use on a low-limit card is the only thing killing my score.","When I was in college, my mother got me on one of those predatory college-aimed cards with a 25-30% interest rate without asking me (seriously), because she knew I would need debt for a credit score. However, since I didn't know that was a high interest rate until recently, I've been using it and paying it off every week. At the time, the credit limit was $500.

However, about a year ago, I had to move for work, had them raise my credit limit to $1500 (since I would finally be on my own), and found myself in an emergency prior to getting paid from the job. Enter the card -- I put the charges for it on my card, since I didn't have any other option. 

Despite paying off twice the minimum  payment each month ($40), and barely using the card (literally only in emergencies, and only when my cash ran dry), I still have $1400 on the card. 

My credit score is about 710 -- I have never missed/went late a single payment in the over 200 payments I've made since my accounts have been open (CC and student loans), and my debt load per month is low (~$300), but this percent-usage per month is killing my credit score and preventing me from wanting to apply to the cards I *do* want.

There is some backstory though: due to a string of unfortunate circumstances and emergencies, I had to move an hour away (closer to home), find a new job and am currently paying 2 rents, since the first place didn't have a lease break stipulation and won't let me sublet (again, contractual terms). That first lease is up in April (assuming the office can't find someone to take over before then) and will free nearly $1k in money to me, which I plan on using to *finally* start up a real emergency fund. Until then, I need to live on fumes (about $100 a month saved until that's over and done with) and only pay the essentials (which I am).

I really, really don't want this on my credit score like this, especially when it's a low limit causing this. 

So, the way I see it, I have several options:

1.) Ask for a credit limit raise, to try and lower that percentage of debt use. I have no idea if this request shows up on my score, though.

2.) Wait until that apartment is paid off/taken over, save up some money, and make a huge down payment ($1k or something like that) to get that monkey off my back, then transfer to a new card, especially once my score goes higher. However, this is opening a new account and that looks bad, unless the amount of debt usage goes up high enough to erase it?

3.) Do a transfer now and save money now in lower interest rates, especially being able to pay the same amount per month and have it mean more in terms of money paid off, but suffer in that I'd be opening a new account again, and that looks bad, etc., and I wouldn't be able to apply to the better cards I want in the nearer future, since that would mean more inquiries/applications in a shorter time.

**TL;DR: Stuck on credit card with predatory rates I'd like to get off of. The low limit on it combined with the high interest (making every payment I make rather pointless) is the only thing holding me back from having a great score. I can't make any big down payments on it for a few months due to some unfortunate things that happened, but come spring, that'd be an opportunity. Do I:**

* **Save up and pay off a huge chunk, then  transfer debt to a better card? Maybe even wait for the effects to show on my score?**

* **Change cards now and start saving in thee interest alone?**

* **Ask for a raise of my credit limit so the percentage used is lowered as a result?**

Thanks for any help, I've been puzzling this over for a few months now.

**Edit: I've done a lot of research into cards, so I know what my goals are. I just need a higher score for them and I know this is holding me back. **",finance,1416868541

Background:   
I married my wife in June and we are looking for strategy on how we report our earnings for this year. I have researched traditional joint vs separate opinions online, but I feel that my position is unique because I am afraid that filing jointly will affect my wife's financial aid in college.

Fully eligible for federal aid due to income and background (50% latino, military stepdad, etc etc)  
Previously lived at home and was considered a dependent  

Concern:  
I am concerned that if we file a joint tax return, that it will kick her out of her federal aid eligibility. If it is more cost effective for her to file separately, I would prefer to. 

Does anyone have experience with this kind of situation? Any advice on how to approach?  

I apologize for any glaring mistakes or obvious solutions, I am simply ignorant of my options. 

If this post fizzles, my next plan is to speak with a financial aid advisor with her college, and/or hire an accountant.

personalfinance,Advice on Personal Loan for Massage Therapy School- I have no idea what I'm doing,"Some background- I'm a 21 year old female that has been working in the food industry since I graduated high school, pretty much living check to check. I decided not to go to college directly out of school because I didn't want to be stuck in student loan debt in case I decided to party my way into failing classes- since I had seen so many older friends/siblings go that route and lose scholarships/get up to their ears in debt. 

I have taken a couple of courses at community college that my parents were so gracious to pay for out of their pockets. But I've come to the conclusion that I don't think a degree is the route for me and that I believe I can really truly thrive in the Massage Therapy profession. 

Here comes my dilemma, I haven't had a bank account for about 3 years since I just didn't really NEED one in my eyes- which has obviously back fired because I know I should have been building up credit all these years. I've just used my boyfriends account that I'm authorized on to cash my work checks and took care of my funds that way. So I have basically ZERO credit. 

Also, the school I have chosen to enroll in (and most massage therapy schools for that matter) don't participate in federal student loans or even private student loans- making it so I'll have to go the route of a personal loan. (As far as I know of....) 

I will be moving cities and transferring my job as well- which is only part time and I only make around $400/month and I was hoping for a two week limbo between starting school and going back to work at a new location- so I am hoping to tack on a little extra money to the personal loan to help me with living expenses for a month or so. 

My parents have told me that as long as I become licensed, they will pay back my loan for me... The only thing is that I have to do all of the work to get the loan and get licensed BEFORE they will help out. 

If anyone, ANYONE AT ALL can help me with getting the ball rolling on this, I would be forever grateful. Thanks, y'all!",finance,1416872895
personalfinance,Student Loan Company Changes Payment Terms,"Hello personalfinance

I have a private student loan from a very large bank.  I was told that if I paid ahead, I would not be able to skip monthly payments. So no matter what, I would need to make a monthly payment. They make it seem like this a good thing as I may pay less in interest, but I see this as a problem if I ever fell on hard times. This seems like a a great idea for the bank, because they would collect more late fees. 

Even though I am currently paid ahead and have not missed a monthly payment, I am very upset that I do not have a safety buffer  with them. To me it almost makes more sense to keep the money I would be giving them in my bank.

I would like to move my loan but I am having issues finding someone will work with a private student loan, or a personal loan for the amount needed of 35,000. The interest rate is around 9% I have a credit score of 734. Can anyone give me suggestions on what to do?",finance,1416873997
personalfinance,Please Help: Entirely overwhelmed by student loan repayment,"I’m coming to you all desperate for advice as I literally have no idea what to do or where to begin. I’ve exhausted my circle of adults, and none have a clue about anything like this. 

I graduated in May of 2013 and was hired as a full time graphic designer in January of 2014. I earn 40,000 a year plus a little here and there for free-lance work I do on the side. The problem is I’m paying a small mortgage’s worth in student loans each month. 

To be precise – I earn 1,235.03 bi-weekly. New Jersey Class gets 343.00 per month. My federal Stafford loans combined get $291.31, and my parent plus loans (not even in my name) through Sallie Mae / Navient get $606.94. Cell-phone and car insurance combined is $200 a month. So each month I’m netting 1029.12 after these basic expenses. My other expenses include gas (20 mile commute), food, car maintenance (I drive an old 2002 buick) and a girlfriend. I’m living at home so I’m not paying rent right now. 

**My question is- what should I do? If anything at all?** I feel like most people don’t pay $1200 a month in student loans… I’ll provide the specific details of each loan in case that will help any advice. 

&gt;**NJ Class:**

&gt;I’m fairly certain these are 10 year although I can’t find it for sure anywhere on the online portal. There are two of them, one with an outstanding principal of 21,880.59 at 7.92% interest, the other with a 12,902.03 principal at 7.59%.  Total outstanding balance: 35,289.43

&gt;**Federal Stafford subsidized / unsubsidized**

&gt;There are 8 of these, one subsidized and one unsubsidized for each year I was at school. Their interest ranges from 3% to 7%, all fixed rate. Their balances range from 2,000 to 5,000. The total outstanding balance: $25,274.23

&gt;**Parent Plus loans**

&gt;These are where I’m really fucked. Halfway through school my parents credit plummeted and we no longer were eligible for NJ class loans. These parent plus loans were the only option for me to continue my degree. The problem is they’re not in my name- they’re in my stepdad’s. I feel like this creates some issues. One has a balance of 26,083.30 at 7.65% interest, the other $22,555.93 at 7.65%. Total 48,639.23. These are 10 year as well. 

So here’s where I’m torn. 


**Should I consolidate?**

Paying $1200 a month definitely sucks being 23, but is this the best bet? It’s not inconvenient to pay all the separate loans- the parent + and federal loans are set up to automatically debit. 


**Can I do [Income-Based repayment?](http://www.ibrinfo.org/) Should I?**

From the overwhelming amount of confusing information on the internet, what I’ve gathered is this: I can consolidate my federal and NJ class loans and pay them to the amount of 10 percent of my income each month. *PLEASE correct this statement if it is wrong.* Assuming that statement is true, this would seemingly lower my total monthly payments to about 840 – 870 (The parent plus payments would remain the same). That gives me a little breathing room, but will I end up paying more in the end? Another thing to consider is – I work for a stable non-profit organization that’s been around for over 10 years. Again, correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe if I remain at this job for 10 years and make all consecutive payments, my balance is forgiven. I haven't even planned what I'm having for dinner tonight, so there's no way I can predict if I'll still be working here in 10 years, but something to consider. 


**Should I go the route of private consolidation?**

Wells-Fargo has been sending me mail trying to grab my loans. I spoke to someone on the phone briefly and I didn’t have all of the details I’m giving you now, but the guy said they could likely get my monthly payments down to $600 dollars. I may be 23 but I’m not stupid… that just sounds too good to be true. What are the pros and cons of getting them consolidated by a bank? Would the bank be able to buy up the parent plus loans and consolidate even though they’re not in my name?

**Which do I attack first?**

Let’s say I don’t consolidate and want to start over-paying my monthly payments… In what order should I attack these loans? Which is the most important to abolish first, second, last?

I really appreciate any advice you guys can give me.. and I’m sorry for the super long post. I really have nowhere else to turn and I feel like every month I don’t take action I’m just hurting myself. It’s an unfortunate position to be in but I’m grateful to have my degree and a stable job when I see my friends working at a gym or a movie theatre…I already know my 20s will suck but I could be worse off.

personalfinance,"FASFA Help, financing college!","Hi guys I hope to get some advice regarding how I should fill out my FASFA form and how my chances look to receive need based financial money for private colleges. 

Background: My mother does not have legal status here in America and she is also a single mother. We live in VA but she wants to permanently move to MD because they offer drivers license for people like her. In order to qualify for the MD license she has to establish domicile there for 2+ years along with tax proof. 

Okays here’s the deal: 
I am a senior applying to colleges and have DACA (deferred action for childhood arrivals) so therefore I have a social security number but do not have citizenship or a legal resident here in America. I know I don't qualify for federal aid but I can qualify for the money private colleges have right? Well even though I don’t have citizenship or a legal residency I can still apply for FASFA or CSS because I have a social security number and counselors have told me to do so.  I am plan to get need based financial (from private schools) help for all my schools but know I am starting to freak out because I think I might not qualify for need based help. My mother is a single mother but over her entire life she has managed to save **$140,000**. But the problem is she has decided to waste that money on “investments”. She bought a house in MD that values for $70,000 and two lots (literally just pieces of land) that value $45,000. The house she is planning to permanently reside once I leave for college and in my opinion is a good investment. But the other two lots she bought she plans to build houses on and sale them for profit! But the problem is she only has $10,000 in her bank account how can she build a house from scratch with $10,000, she can’t! In addition to that I don’t think she qualifies for loans because she doesn't have an SSN, but a tax id number, and she only makes 2,000 a month. Can she get loans on those pieces of properties from banks? But even if she can she will not use that money towards my college education but rather towards building these houses. In terms of her job sustainability… I’m pretty sure she can’t last at her job because her job is literally a man’s job, a finisher for construction and she’s getting old. I think she will probably last 5 more years in that job field. But wait there is more she has also invested $25,000 in a trucking business, she bought a truck but it ended up needing a lot of repairs so instead of making a profit she lost money. In addition the truck is not working right now because there is no driver and it needs repairs. One more thing you need to know she hasn't filed her taxes for the 2013 and 2014 ones because I told her that I needed her to file in VA to qualify for instate tuition and since we still live in VA (in our apartment complex). She wants taxes in MD to get a license and I want her to do them in VA so I can qualify for instate tuition just in case I go to a public school. For the past 14 years she has been filing in VA just so you know. Although she bought the house in MD we don't live there because it needs repairs and I still go to school in VA. Now what I want to know is whether I can qualify for need based financial aid from private schools. I think I should because I know we are not well off but I'm scared that just because my mom owns all these things they will think we are. The other problem is that I'm leaning towards private schools because they don't care about state domicile but would it look weird if my mom did do her taxes in MD but then see my transcript and see it’s from VA. 

I'm just so confused as what to do? 

I know this is wrong but I was also thinking of just lying and just not adding the fact that she owns all these properties. She bought all the properties with cash there is no tax I.D. or SSN tied to these properties other than her name. Will they ever find out? How do they even go about check the validness of FASFA or CSS?",finance,1416883991
personalfinance,My experience with SoFi - Student Loan Refinance,"I recently refinanced my student loans with SoFi. There is not too much information available on prior posts, so I wanted to summarize my experience. 

**Background:**

I am about 5 years out of school. I have around $30K in loans outstanding (down from $70K at graduation!). I have a decent paying job and good credit. 

**Application Process:**

The application process on SoFi's website is pretty straightforward. There is a tool to ""find your rate"" that asks for some basic info that doesn't require a hard credit pull. From what I can tell, your rate is derived from your credit score, current income, and length of work history. You are then shown various loan products with different payback periods (5, 10, or 15 year) and options for fixed vs variable interest rates. 

If you don't complete your application on the spot, you will be sent a pre-approval email that should mirror the rates you received from the ""find my rate"" tool. 

I was hesitant to continue with the application process because I don't know anyone that has used SoFi. I ultimately decided to go forward because I was approved for a 3.1% variable rate (after a .25% rate reduction for auto pay) on a 10 year loan. My loan was previously at a 6.8% with about 15 years remaining. It's kind of crazy to think about how much money I will be saving on interest each year. It's easily over $1K. 

Once you decide to move forward, you need to give SoFi your loan payoff information so they can close out your old loans and fund your new loan. There is a step by step guide that walks you through the process for dozens of different lenders. I found it very easy.

At this point, SoFi will do a hard credit pull and verify your income. Once everything is final, you electronically sign your loan documents. 

The entire application process took a few days. My loan was funded about a week later. 

**Loan Servicing:**

Once your loan is established, you will be using TruStudent to service the loan. I found the interface clunky compared to some other loan websites I've used, but all of the features are there. The auto pay is easy to setup and you can make extra payments without a prepayment penalty. 

**General Thoughts:**

SoFi's customer service is great. Throughout the process, you can call up and talk to a human who is fluent in English. I believe they are based out of the west coast, so they are open pretty late if you are on the east coast. 

There are referral codes that gives you a $100 bonus for signing up! The bonus is paid through PayPal. I got my bonus about a month after my  loan was established. Ask a friend who have used SoFi for their code. They will also get a $100 bonus when you sign up using their code. 

Overall, I am very satisfied with the process. If you have good credit, look into their products. This is not a federal loan, so you will lose those perks (income based repayment, loan forgiveness programs, etc). 

One last note, even though SoFi had my loan payoff information for my old loans, I still owed a few bucks for accrued interest. Just make sure you make sure your old loans are completely paid off before you forget about them.

personalfinance,Questions about employer's actions regarding PTO,"My apologies in advance if this is likely not the most relevant sub to post this in, but I could not figure out where else to post it (please suggest if some place else is more relevant). I'll get right to it - My wife has worked in a doctor's office in a large hospital for 10+years which is now recently owned by a huge company in Virginia. Some of their new policies seem completely messed up and possibly illegal to me but I want some advice.

1. Since the giant company bought out this hospital, no employees are given any paid holidays off work. That sucks but not illegal. My beef is that not only is the office closed on major holidays and they don't get paid, but employees must use their PTO during these holidays. Even if the employee wants to work on a holiday, they can't because the office is closed and they have to use 8 hours of their PTO.

2. Regardless of holidays, if the office is closed for some snow storm or power outage or anything else, the employees have to use their PTO on these says as well. It's one thing if the office is closed and you just don't get paid for working that day, but to have to use your paid time off on a day that the office is closed seems completely messed up to me.

3. For the day before Christmas, her new boss has graciously stated that the employees are going to be able to take a 60 minute lunch break instead of the usual 30 minute lunch. But they have to clock out for the entire hour. None of the employees are planning on using the whole hour because they think it is BS.

I've tried looking up other subreddits and googling stuff about Virginia and federal labor laws but haven't found anything. This all seems completely unfair to me as well as to my wife's 20+ coworkers. Is there any kind of laws or rules in place that could help or are we just screwed for working in a right-to-work state or is this completely normal around the US?",finance,1416889405

personalfinance,"If I Get A Job In September, Why Am I Being Taxed As If I Started In January?","I'm going to keep this simple. Let's say I was unemployed until the second half of the year, when I started a job making $60K / year, with a company that runs their payment scheme through the IRS.

Each time I get a paycheck, around 26% is taken out because that's how much people making 60K are taxed in my state. And I have filled out the relevant forms to minimize (or should this be maximize?) my deductions as much as possible.

Come tax season next year, I have a windfall to collect. To simplify things I'm going to pretend that nothing below 15K gets taxed and everything above 15K is taxed at this 26% rate. The reality is a little more nuanced, as it operates upon a sliding scale.

So I get 15 * 26%, which is 3.9 Thousand Dollars. 3.9 thousand dollars that I sorely could have used, but was withheld from me the year I earned it due to some tax algorithm that failed to take into account the amount I had already earned that year (which was a goose egg).

I needed the $3900 the year I earned it, not the year after. Is there anything I could have done to prevent this taxation so I could have used the money as I earned it?

And why do the federal and state governments not take the amount I have earned this year to date (information that they surely have access to) into account when they tax me? At surface level it seems they aren't being honest, but I'm sure there are actual rationales for them doing so and not adjusting the tax rate as I earn money.",finance,1416893933
personalfinance,Thoughts on buying a home with 10% down,"This has come up a few times recently so I thought I'd share my experience.

We live in the Bay Area. We moved from a 2 Bed 1 Bath apartment in Mountain View ($1895/month) to a town home in the San Ramon Valley. We put 10% down on a 3/2.5 town home that cost between $600k and $700k. A few thoughts about buying that I haven't seen mentioned before:

1. Your rent now is not what your rent will be next year or the year after. When we bought and moved out of our apartment the owner rented it for $2300. Our neighbors told us all about it when their rents were raised at the same time.
2. Calculate ""trash money"" on ownership. This is (Mortgage Payment + HOA + Property Taxes + Insurance) - (Principal paid + tax savings due to deductions for interest/property tax). While a total monthly payment might be around $4000 for a $700k home, $1000 is principal and $2700 is interest. That brings your total ""trash money"" to $4000 - $1000 - $2700*.25 = $2325. In other words, $2325 each month is thrown away, just like rent. Your number might look different, so do the calculation.
3. For us, ""trash money"" was equal to the rent we would have paid. This does not mean the two situations are equal. Maintenance costs, utilities, etc. are all going to be more in a bigger home than an apartment. Additionally, we are forced to invest $1000 each month in the home via our mortgage payment. Previously we were putting aside $2000/month to save for a down payment, so for us it was in line with our habits, but should something happen we would not have the flexibility we once had.
4. If you put 10% down, you have the option of either paying PMI or taking a higher interest rate (called Lender Paid Mortgage Insurance, or LPMI). With traditional PMI, you will pay more each month but when your equity reaches 20% you can remove PMI from the loan. With LPMI, your interest rate is higher but your total payment is lower. The downside is that you won't be able to remove the premium without refinancing.
5. Make a decision: 5 years or 30 years. We have 2 kids right now so a 1500 sqft 3 Bedroom 2.5 Bath is the right size. With 3 kids it would work. With 4 kids it would be pretty tricky. Since we plan to have a few more kids in the future, we decided that we are on a 5 year plan. 5/1 ARM with LPMI was what we finally chose because it was the cheapest option for the next 5 years. We will have to refinance or sell before the end of the 5 years and we are ok with that. Understand the risk and run the numbers.
6. If your market is on fire, like ours was, then every week prices will go up. Additionally, cash offers are common, making 10% down offers riskier. Be prepared to overpay a bit. We had to compete with 4 other offers (mostly reliable investment offers) and my understanding is that we barely got it even though we were $5k higher than the next offer (and 5% over asking). While it sucked to overpay, the house had appreciated about that much in the 30 days it took to close.
7. Keep an eye on the market. While not guaranteed, the market in our area has continued to rise. Less than a year later, our home has appreciated significantly. In the next few months we may be able to refinance with 20% equity. This is an exceptional time in the Bay Area, but it is working out well for us.

This was not a risk free decision but it seems to be going well. My job is fairly secure for the next 4 years and our hope is to save up enough to step up to a 4 bedroom house a few years from now (expecting ~$1M).

I hope this is helpful to someone. We had to learn a lot in a very short period of time and a lot of this was not obvious to us. Feel free to ask questions.

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Consolidation Questions,"SO! I've read through a number of the posts here and have found some really great information about student loans and good ways to handle them and such, but nothing that answers my direct question:

I have a number of federal student loans across two different servicing companies: NelNet for the subsidised ones and ACS with all my unsubsidized ones(originally serviced through Wells Fargo).

- NelNet is, by far, the easier site/company to work with.  They let me break down my different loans with them to apply additional payments specifically to the loan I want, and show me exactly what my interest rate on each loan is.

- ACS, on the other hand, shows me the cumulative sum of the amount I owe, and gives me the rate I need to pay them based off this, also telling me I have ""mixed"" interest rate (some are variable, some fixed, but they don't show me which loan has how much money still owed and at what interest rate).

- I have looked at the Federal Loan Consolidation program, and noticed that when I was looking at my options, that I was able to see the breakdown of my loan amounts serviced through ACS, and noticed that I can move my consolidated loan over to NelNet as a servicer.

My question is two parts: 
- Am I able to just transfer all my loans from one servicer to another and have them be individual loans still?
- IF NOT, would I be able to ""consolidate"" my loans from ACS one at time, and transfer them over to NelNet? Or would it have to be in one big lump sum (a real consolidation)?

I'm not trying to get a better interest rate, really even, more just trying to make it easier for me to engage in ""snowball"" type divide and conquer finance tactics. Also, NelNet's interface/customer service is MILES and above better than ACS (seriously, it took 8 attempts online &amp; 4 phone calls to get my address updated!)

TLDR: What precisely are the restrictions on moving between Federal Student Loan servicers, and on how you use Federal Loan Consolidation?

personalfinance,Upsidedown Auto Refinance,"First let me start off by saying thank you to all of you who post and comment in this sub, I've been able to get things together for the first time in my life and I’m proud of that. 

A quick history – Divorced in 2007 and lost a lot. Foreclosed on a house, had my car repossessed, faulted on student loans and a few credit cards. Over the years I ignored it because I didn't make enough money to pay anything with the child support bill. 5 years ago I landed a killer job with great pay and I started on this financial adventure. The challenge was the job was in another city and I have to commute 100 miles a day. I purchased a car in June of 2011 with 75,000 miles on it for 15k. I was financed at 17.9% interest because of my credit but I am determined to do this all on my own. After 29 payments I’m down to owing 9.5k and I have 30 payments left. I can afford the payment, but I’ve put on another 75,000 miles on the car since I bought it so 150,000 miles on a car I owe 9.5k on makes me a bit nervous. I am required to drive to other branches in my state for work.  The vehicle Blue Books at 5.9k as is.

I received an email from Capital One for a vehicle refinance loan. I have 3 Credit Cards through Capital One so I get frequent offers from them. I filled out the app and got approved for 13% but what caught me off guard was the 3k finance charge tacked onto the loan. I don’t like the idea of another 3k being added onto something I know won’t last another 2.5 years but I need to do something. 

My credit is still pretty crappy, right around 600 but I do have a lot of accounts being reported which I’m working on paying off. I’ve been working with the credit bureaus and I’ve successfully removed 11 accounts from the divorce since it was 7 years ago, the car repossession being one of them. However, my scores haven’t really improved. I know it’s going to take a long time to see them go up and I’m intent on not filing for bankruptcy. I can do this! 

Loan from Condor Capital – 9.5k at 17.9% was just sold to West Lake Financial  

My budget is around 2900 for all monthly expenses 

I’ve got about 200 a month left over that usually go towards doctor bills, child costs, fuel  cost for work travel and other unforeseen expenditures. I don’t have much room to play with. I attempted to go to 2 different credit unions in my area and neither of them will refinance the vehicle because of the mileage. My wife is in need of a car but I can’t afford to purchase another one at this interest rate but at the same time I can’t afford to continue to put mileage on a vehicle that needs to last for 2.5 more years. My wife is in school and does not work. Any advice is welcome. Please let me know if you have any questions.

personalfinance,Digging my way out - Need Advice and Support,"Plain and simple, I need help. I have never been financially responsible, and now that I am nearing thirty (27), I feel it is time to take charge of my finances. 

I recently just got a great job and moved across the country from the Deep South to the North East. It is more expensive up here. I need to set reasonable expectations of how to live frugally without racking myself into further credit card debt, and also concurrently plan how to pay off the debt I am in.

Speaking of debt, I am in quite a hole. Thankfully, I am in the mindset that it is attainable to dig myself out. I realize that there are people who were far worse than I who have achieved their goals of being financially free from debt. I have not always made the best decisions in life, which has led me to the hole I am in today. I realize it, and I realize that I can and want to change my life. Now is the time.

So to get down to the nuts and bolts, here is my financial situation:

----------------------------------Debts--------------------------------------------

Credit Cards:
$8500 @ 7.9% interest
$4188 @ 12.9% interest

Personal Loans:
$14,945 @ 10.99% ; 13.84%(APR)

Student Loans:
$5987.33 @ 6.80%
$5500.27 @ 6.80%
$1807.18 @ 4.50%
$758.82   @ 6.80%
--------------------------- 
Total Debts: $41686.66

So I am 40K+ in the hole. 




Here is my income and monthly expenses:

---------------------------Total Gross Income (Monthly): 4583.34--------------------------

Monthly Before Tax Deductions: 
Health Plan - $170.72
Dental Plan - $21.68
Vision Plan - $13.08

Fed Taxable Gross: $4377.86

Net Pay(Monthly): Not sure since I just started; not sure how to calculate Fed withholding, medicare, state, and local taxes. I live and work in Massachusetts

------------------------------------Expenses (Monthly)-------------------------------------

Rent:                $1050 (all bills included)
Cell Phone:                        $116.14
Subway Card:                    $75.00
CC1 Min Payment:              $269.00
CC2 Min Payment:              $86.00
Student Loan Min Payment: $226.57
Personal Loan Min Payment: $589.22

Total Expenses (monthly): $2411.93
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I know it might be hard to calculate without my net, but assuming I net 3000 every month that leaves me with 588.07 left over to spend on groceries/entertainment/misc.

I realize that is not that much and have had to cut back on how much I spend going out and on food. 

Basically, I'm trying to find a silver lining. How do I pay off what seems like a mountain of debt when I can only just afford to pay the minimums. I def. need some advice on how to tackle this.

Wild Cards:

1. So with my new job I really think there is room to progress in the next 2 years. If I work hard, stay diligent, and prove myself I think that I could easily get a raise to $65k a year (conservatively, from $55k).

I would really appreciate some advice. You guys are experts and I really want to turn my life around...",finance,1416929253
Bitcoin,Bitcoin Missionaries,"Apologies if this has been suggested before. I did a quick search and couldn't find anything, but the idea seems like such a no-brainer that it has probably been explored in some form before. So I know that bitcoin detractors love to mock the 'evangelism' of hardcore supporters in the community, but this passion and determination to spread the message of bitcoin is particularly justified I feel in empowering the world's poorest to achieve economic freedom. The sort of people with no access to financial services, who are unrelentingly raped by remittances services such as WU, and whose own government continually devalues its currency through poor monetary policy.

This issue has been discussed a lot in this sub, so maybe it's time we took collective action. We could crowdfund a project whereby we donate bitcoins to the world's poor en masse. A substantial amount per person/family -such as $50 - as much as an entire month's living cost in some areas, and probably more than a year's disposable income. This could be distributed by trusted community members already living in sub-Saharan Africa/Middle East/ South America, etc, who could help beneficiaries to understand bitcoin, as well as liaising with local businesses.

If we raised $1 million in bitcoin donations, we could potentially make 20 000 lives a hell of a lot better. Quite a few people on here backed the idea of donating $1 million of bitcoin to make one individual a millionaire. I'd argue that donating to the third world would reflect the community in a better light and gain more exposure.

From the perspective of setting up a bitcoin ecosystem, if we focus on a few areas, even if as little as 5-10% of the population of these towns and villages begin to use bitcoin, word of mouth and the superiority of bitcoin as a store/transfer of value will take care of the rest. Especially in states with hyperinflatory currencies.

Any thoughts?",cryptocurrency,1416930071
personalfinance,Selecting Disappointing 401k Options,"Hi PF! I just started working for a new company, and I took a look at their 401k options, and I'm quite disappointed...  My previous employer used all Vanguard funds.

Background Info:  I only plan on putting in 5% (I could be convinced to max it though, but continue reading to see my reasoning for why I don't want to), since the company matches based on performance (maximum 5% -- It'll be 5% this year, they are obtainable goals.)  Next year, I'll make enough to force me to perform backdoor roths, so alternative options seem to be limited.  Also, I'm 21, I'm debt free, and I plan on retiring from a W-2 job early.  Since my income needed for happiness isn't very much, and I'd like to continue building my small business (the income generated from it now is negligible, but it has potential... it'd be something I'd play with ""in retirement."")  So, really... I see the money I put into here will be a ""post-retirement bonus.""  I'm just banking on the matches making it worth tying my money up for the next many, many years.

Any thoughts on the allocation I should make?  I almost just want to distribute between the lower expense ratio ones... but ALARX, even with its high expense ratio has performed pretty well.  Granted... I'm not sure how to really calculate performance after expense ratios take their cut...

My YTD wages have been ~45k gross
Fed withholding ~6.1k
State ~1,600

We're installing about $18k in solar panels on our primary residence, so to my knowledge 30% of that applies as a tax credit, so ~6k.

If, hypothetically, my year tax liability was 6k (the same I have in Fed withholding right now), would I get all of that back due to the solar tax credit? Or does the Tax Credit only apply to any tax bill above what my withholding covers?

If you have any websites you know to be helpful, that would be great too.

personalfinance,A year ago I took out a loan on a truck. Now I'm sick of making payments and the truck itself in general. What are my options?,"Long story short, my old car broke down and I let my dad convince me that I should go to a car lot and finance something newer and more reliable. I'm pretty handy with cars so it never bothered me to fix things here and there, but for some reason I went against my better judgement, put $800 down and let my dad cosign for me on a 2008 Ford Ranger. Having bought all my previous cars by owner through craigslist, I was in over my head and had no idea what I was getting myself into. The loan was for about $13K.

So now I've been paying $240 /mo. for the past 12 months, and I've barely paid off $1000. At this rate I'll have worn out the truck well before I come close to paying it off. I make $10 / hr working 50 hours a week, so it's a major chunk of my take home pay which is about $470 a week. If it weren't for the car payment I could easily pay my measly $390 monthly rent and live somewhat comfortably without living check to check.

I have done a little research and it looks like I could take out a loan at a better interest rate and pay off the car loan? What are some other options? This is a somewhat foreign subject to me so any help is very much appreciated. This is something that has been bugging me for a long time.",finance,1416938839
personalfinance,Advice Wanted: Student loan consolidation/refinancing.,"Short version: I'm wondering if consolidating my loans now will hurt my ability to refinance them next year.

**Edit:** Private loans are on 10 year payback, and unable to change that without refinancing. Federal loans are on Graduate Extended.

--------------
I have a lot of student loans, and while I'm making a net positive in paying them off and living, I'm not liking the margins. My situation's a little complicated, so here goes:

I went to an expensive Ivy League, and got a Mechanical Engineering degree. A year and a half into my degree, my family dropped all funding to me because I was gay and an atheist. As it turns out, there is no grants/funding for people who have parents that *can* pay for education, but *refuse* to.

So, I've ended up with something short of $200,000 school loan debt with a 10 year payback period, scattered across federal and mostly private, plus $10,000 in credit card debt from being unemployed and having to move a lot to try to find a job, with little outside support. It's not pretty.

I've got a nice job now, at $64,000, but 1/2 of my net income goes to student loan minimums. ~$2,000

I tried to refinance my loans, but my ""income to debt ratio"" is too low for anyone to accept it. (Kinda the point of trying to refinance...) 

I was thinking of trying to consolidate my private loans into a longer-term loan, so I can pay down my credit card quickly, then focus on the student loans. But that doesn't change any of my interest rates, which refinancing does.  I was wondering if consolidating now would hurt my chances of applying for a refinance later, because I would rather have a lower interest rate in a year than lower payments today.

Again, I'm making a net positive, even with this ridiculous amount of debt, but it's not pretty.

Summation:

**Federal:**
Subsidized: $9,000 @ 6.55 %
Unsubsidized: $13,000 @ 6.55 %
Graduate Plus Unsub.: $50,000 @7.65%

personalfinance,Am I being taken advantage of with my salary (work expectations/compensation),"Back in March I started working for a private business in the seed industry as a research and development scientist. I was started out at 13.50 hourly. In August, they put me on salary for 38,500/year which works out to about 18.50/hour. The benefits include health insurance, 401k match and ""vacation time""; all things somebody with a college education (myself) expects as part of the gig (the company is mostly staffed by high school graduates and high school dropouts, so for THEM the benefits are just jim-dandy.)

They require 40 hours per week, but expect at least 50. 90% of my day is spent screwing around since I am ridiculously efficient at what I do, so it is a grind to even make it to 40. The boss-man is overly impressed with my work on a daily basis. So far, so good, right?

overtime is paid as ""comp time"". Again, something one would expect. Here is where I feel I am being taken advantage of: I give them 10 hours, they give me 1 hour of comp time. Mathematically, I have to give about 6000$ of basically free labor to earn a week of vacation (like 700$ worth of time). 

I have always had the understanding that a salary job means I am paid for 40 hours/week no matter if I work 20 or 60 just so long as my job duties are performed on time.

I finally got to the point where I could afford the car I wanted. A brand new Mercedes C63 AMG. Put $25,000 down. Loved every second of owning it.  
  
Someone made an illegal U-Turn and hit me. Hard. Airbags deployed. No one injured. Car will likely be totaled. It's less than a year old. The other party's insurance has accepted full liability for the accident. There is $40,000 left on the loan. I have gap insurance, but I'm not worried about being upside down.  
  
I'm still out of a significant portion of my down payment. If I had put 0 down and kept the money in the bank and paid the monthly payment from there, I would have only paid up until the accident, then gap insurance would cover any difference in the check I receive from insurance and the remaining balance. Of course, the monthly payment would be higher, but I'd still have cash from the down payment in a separate account.  
  
I apologize that I'm having a hard time putting my question into words.

I read the FAQs for this type of situation but I still have some questions.   I could throw the whole thing into my 6 figure loans, but would this even make a difference in the big picture if I'm making a lot more money down the line and will be able to afford larger payments as a result?  

I plan on maximizing my 401k contributions through work and supplementing the difference with the cash from the law suit, so that I am confident about.  

I would be most interested in turning this into more money, I just don't really know where to start and I want to make sure there is as little risk in my decision as possible.  I'm basically trying to figure out if I should spread the money around, invest it all into 1 thing, pay off a chunk of student loans, etc., and to what capacity for each.

personalfinance,"Cancelled my Perm. LI Plan with NWM! (Funny BS he fed me, and some questions/advice seeking.)","First, some background. My wife and I make about a combined 100k a year. We have a house, student loans, and auto debt right now, and our budget has been tight.

A little less than a year ago, Northwestern Mutual talked us into signing up for an 80- term plan worth 300k. Shortly after, we rolled 75k of that into a whole life insurance plan.

I did some research and found that they don't really make much sense. Especially somebody in my position.) Some of the research was watching this sub and the FAQ Wikia page.

So I scheduled a meeting with him yesterday and said I need to cancel the whole life plan. He surprises me and says, get this... ""Well then, it doesn't make sense for us to do business anymore. I'll ask you to go elsewhere."" Tells me that ""they are a financial ADVICE company, not a low cost insurance company."" I guess that's pretty telling right there.

I am an engineer and excel nerd. So I told him I've done the math. We don't even break even for 10+ years. And after that, it makes like 4-5% year after year. Based on the estimates, etc. that he gave me.

*Well then, I guess this isn't going to work out.*


My plan now is to get insurance from somewhere else for ~$50 for my wife and I, rather than the $250 we were paying for this plan. Invest the other $200/mo into a Roth.

Just a few other fallacies he tried to tell me before I walked out:

* ""It's about a consistently positive growth rate. You'd be surprised what compounding interest that's consistently positive will do."" (Uh.. no I won't. It'll make 5%, right? IRAs will average out to 10% typically, and I don't plan on retiring for 40 years.)

* The benefit is having diversification. What we should do is open you a Roth too, but keep this open. (okay, more sales, when I just told you our budget is tight? Hm..)

* After you retire, you want more stable accounts. If the market crashes, you don't want all your money in IRAs because those assets are worth less and you don't want to liquidate them. So you want a more stable option. (Okay, I get this. But right now, I should be focused on building as much money as possible, right? There are different funds I can use to mitigate risk, but I'll think about that when I'm, say, 50. Right?)

Just wanted to share my experience and ask a few questions:

1. He told me there are like *pennies* in cash value right now, and in January it will be 1 year in and it's worth a couple hundred dollars... Does that makes sense? Is it as simple as what's more, what I put in from now on vs. what I would gain back?
2. Should I expect to pay any cancellation fees of any kind? He said he would check, but probably not. That answer sounds fishy.
3. Any other general advice? Things I should know?",finance,1416951941

2. How do I ensure I'm getting the best price possible for my car insurance and my car? My car is a 2008 Honda Civic, 80,000 miles when I got it, and my payment/price seems comparable to what my friends pay for similar cars.  
3. Would it be advisable for me to take out a large student loan with a lower interest rate than my cards to pay off my cards? I've heard conflicting things not only regarding the usefulness of this, but also whether or not this is legal/ethical.

personalfinance,Paying Off Student Loans From Emergency Fund,"I'm a 24 year old college grad and starting to make a decent living. I can cover all my expenses, put money towards a 401k through work every month, and in addition can save anywhere from $300-$500/mo.  

When I was looking for full-time work back in the summer, I got my student loans, totaling $23,000, deferred until June 2015. I was paying ~260/mo, and now accrue ~$40/mo in interest that does not need to be paid until the deferment ends. If I do not pay it once the deferment ends, the total will be added to the principal of the loan, so paying that off is a no brainer.

My question concerns a mutual fund account in my name that is worth roughly $21,000. It was set up by my parents when I was little, and almost all of the money I got for birthdays, holidays, etc was put into the account. I've seen this money as an untouchable emergency stash/long term investment vehicle, but would it be smarter to use a large portion of the account to pay down the student loans immediately? The number in my mind was pay off $16,000 of the student loans, so I still have $5,000 in case something comes up, as well as a much more manageable monthly student loan payment come June.

Bitcoin,So the Bitcoin community acting against WU is just childish?,"##First

People in 2nd and 3rd world countries are working 12, 14, 16 hours a day, at minimum wage, for bosses that threat them like dirt and worse. After a month of work, they try to send this money back to their families at home, very far away. This is their main and only goal in life: working 6 to 7 days a week in order to support their families. In order to send this money over, they are depending on a money-transferring system. This demand has fed the growth of businesses like WU.

WU is highly active in 2nd and 3rd world nations, trying to take as much money from these people as possible in the form of outrageous fees, and this has been going on for decades, because these people have got no viable alternatives.

**It's not WU, or any other money transferring business ( nor banks ), who have used their profits to take the time to build a new cheap fast worldwide money transferring system.**

It was **the people**, and geniuses like Mr. Nakamoto and the ones who came before and after, who've invented systems like Bitcoin. These people will be ultimately making it possible for these poor families to **not** get ripped. These people are building and deploying new technologies to make the world and humanity itself move forward, so we don't have to depend on corporations full of self-interest.

##Then,

there was an ordinary guy, a Bitcoin supporter, who saw an ad of WU. Partly jokingly and partly seriously, he took this ad and mocked it up by adding Bitcoin to the right. Another ordinary guy, also a Bitcoin supporter, found it both funny and important to post it on his personal Facebook-page. And then, something childish happened: WU filed a copyright complaint in an attempt to censor the image.


WU, who never took the time to help people in the 2nd and 3rd world countries, is directly attacking a new technology that **does** want to help. And now you guys, the Bitcoin community itself, are starting to fight each other by calling verbal attacks on WU childish, condemning each other, calling each other childish? Attacking WU, or laughing at WU, is ""childish""? Spamming their twitter account is ""childish"" ? Spamming their Facebook page is ""childish"" ?


Then what do you call the theft from these real poor people I described above, which has been going on for decades. They are taking away from people who have to fight for survival every single day. And what for? WHAT FOR ? Let me tell you what for: to increase a number on a bank account. 

There is no human soul behind that bank account, there is no poor family behind it. It's just a number. A number attached to a company, a system. Yes, this company also feeds people: it's own employees. For WU, that are 7,000 employees. But the truth is that these 7,000 people could be spending their valuable time and skills on something else.

##Finally

They've decided not to. Instead, they prefer a 9-to-5 job, working for WU, being part of this ""entity"" that screws people over. It's these people, that are contacting Facebook for a copyright complaint. It's these people, who are posting cozy Christmas messages by using Twitter. And now it are **these people**, who have to read through our ""childish"" Bitcoin spam, having to spend their weekly meetings, at their boring 9-to-5 jobs, on ""what to do about the Bitcoin fiasco"".

Maybe, just maybe, it makes them wonder about what the hell they are doing with their lives. Maybe, just maybe, it makes them try to think like responsible grown-ups for a second instead of children just doing their jobs.

I managed to save $10k last year while working overseas and still paid my monthly loan fee. This is my 2nd year in the same job and i plan to work and save again. However, I have 10k sitting in the bank right now and am not sure what the best move is; should I put the 10k on my loan in a lump sum or should I invest it? Putting it on my loan will save me months of interest as I will pay off the loan quicker, but I'm still afraid to make such a big move without some advice. 

My floating interest rate on my loan is 5.5% and the only ""safe"" investment I can think of is a Tax Free Savings Account which seems to be giving me 0.0008% interest gain a month. Is there any other ""safe"" investment I could make with this 10k that would make me more money than saving months of the 5.5% interest by putting it on my loan? According to my calculations I will save around $2,000 interest in 5 years if I put 10k on my loan. So I guess the question is; can I make more than 2k on any investment in 5 years?

First time poster, long time lurker without a username. 

I want to start off by saying I'm a father of two amazing children, a little girl (23 months) and boy (4 months). I am also married to an amazing woman who has so many aspirations in life it's tough to keep up. 

She has her own portrait photography business (just started two weeks ago, already has 15 bookings) and a somewhat successful Wedding Cinematography business I help her with on the weekends. Being a full time mom of two, she has little time to truly devote to growing her business in the evenings so I handle all client meetings, the business finances, editing videos, etc. She handles the photography side of things simply because I don't have the eye for that. 

A little history on us:

I graduated in 2009 with a B.A. in History and have been fortunate enough to find a job with that useless degree in banking. I have been with the bank I work for, for nearly 5 years now. I make 46,000 a year after this much time, which barely cuts it. 

My wife graduated with a B.A. in Special Education and was unable to land a job in two years of trying anywhere remotely near where we live. So she gave up and went into the nanny business. Luckily, she was able to nanny for a family of lawyers who paid her extremely well. That is over now that we have two kids. 

After much fear and personal debate, I have finally made the decision to go back to school. I start Jan 5 at Colorado State University - Global Campus to pursue a B.S. in Management Information Systems. Only 10 classes to get the degree so I will be finished in December 2015. That should open up a world of opportunity, I hope. My ultimate goal is to be a .NET Developer or a SQL Engineer/Architect. (My employer will be covering approximately 75% of the cost of these classes, the rest I am trying to make up via grants/scholarships) 

So our finances:

$3000 in combined bank accounts
$20,000 in camera equipment
Monthly Expenses:
$328.00 for my car (owe $7,500 still)
$166.00 for medical (owe $2,166 still)
$195.00 for wedding cinematography advertising (contracted until June 2015)
$300.00 for groceries
$200.00 for gas
$200.00 for business expenses (DVD packaging and shipping)
$250.00 for new carpet (will be paid off at this rate in March 2015 per contract) 
$320.00 approximately for Internet/TV/Utilities
$120.00 cell phone
$450.00 on student loans (Sallie Mae ($25,000 owed and Federal $35,000 owed) (I was an out of state student who was taken advantage of by his parents who wanted a tax break. I was uneducated in the fact i could have had most of my schooling covered had I only claimed myself the whole time since I did not live with my parents.)(Insert mini violin here)
We have decided to opt out on new clothes/entertainment for us so we have no budget for that now. 

I am sure I am forgetting something but this is all I can think of this morning at work.

My wife is making about $250.00 a month with her photography start-up. We make probably on average $1500-2000 a month for the cinematography side when you take all our weddings income and divide it by 12 months. 

I make $46,000 salary with quarterly/annual bonuses so we will call it an even $50,000. I have a sales position with the bank now I am drastically trying to get out of, and into a business analyst or analyst role to start gaining experience toward my career path. Unfortunately the bank I work for is not huge on helping out my career change (or any others for that matter). So I appear to be stuck. 

So I am seeking help. What should we do with our money? Should we invest further into our businesses? Should we just nix all spending except essential items (food for our family/kids, new clothes as my son is already in 6 month clothes, little guy grows fast!) 

During this next year, I want to do everything I can to:
A) Get us financially stable.
B) Start bringing in more income to allow us to do more. 
C) Be financially stress free for once in my life (this may not be realistic for the time being)

TL/DR
We have no money. I want to provide a better and brighter future for my family so I am going back to school. How in the hell do I make more money and what financial advice do you have for me?",finance,1417009745

A few months after I moved in I had some car trouble, and started racking up a little bit of credit card debt. I have about $7,500 on a Commerce Bank visa (about $1500 is cash advance due to my checking account), and $3000 on a Costco American Express. On top of this I have $650 of Nebraska Furniture Mart debt (0% APR til 2016), and $6,500/2.5yrs left on my auto loan. I feel like I'm being stretched pretty thin between all these payments and interest charges. I feel like I need to consolidate. I keep telling myself I just need to pay off one of these and I can start pulling ahead (i.e. once I pay off my car I'll have an extra $250/mo)   
  
Which is where my question comes in. Commerce Bank sent me some balance transfer checks linked to my current CC (the one with $7.5k on it) for 0% APR until Dec 2015. I've read about these things, but all the warnings don't seem to apply to this. This isn't a new card that I'm opening up. The interest rate after the promotional period is a reasonable 13%. The fee is 5%. The only ""catch"" I see is a sentence that reads   
  
&gt;""If you take advantage of this offer you will not be able to avoid interest payments on new purchases until your entire balance is paid, including the balance created through this offer.""  
  
I'm thinking I can transfer the costco card to my commerce card, and save about $40/mo in interest. Or I could write a check to myself for the cash, and then use that 0% money to pay down the previous $1,500 cash advance on my credit card which currently has an APR of 25%.

investing,why is jnk and sjnk performing so poorly?,"My take has been that two forces move the principle value of junk bonds, the market (which affects the credit-worthiness of the companies) and interest rates.  Currently the market (as represented by the S&amp;P 500) is strong and interest rates are holding at quite low.  High quality bonds are doing just fine at the moment indicating interest rates are acting as expected.  However, junk bonds are really lagging.  

My best guess is small caps are doing quite poorly and the issuers of jnk bonds are largely small and mid caps.  Is this the case?  Is this signalling that the creditworithiness of small and mid caps are in question?  Does this indicate a general 'risk off' behavior in the bond market (which is odd as stocks are doing fine).

I've paid off all of my student/credit card debt and i have $57K in the bank right now.   I am going to get called any day now to put in a bank application for the home loan and i'm planning to pay $26K to buy the home loan interest rate down to 1.5%.   I have not decided whether or not to put any money above that $26K into the principle of the loan. 

I have nothing saved towards retirement/investment, but that's my next thing i'm going to attack once i secure the home. 

Question:    Would it be wise to put any money over the $26K towards the principle?  (As an example: putting 10K towards principle would only bring my monthly housing payment by about $40/mo).  Should i start taking any money past the $26K and start looking into investments/retirement options?   It seems to me that if the loan is 30 year fixed at 1.5% that a retirement investment should appreciate more than that 1.5% .  

 I'm in new financial territory, Is there a part to this math that i am overlooking?

personalfinance,For a Noob: CC vs Business Loan,"I'm trying to figure out if starting my own business is feasible right now, and I'm just trying to weigh my options. I have very little personal capital that I can inject into the business, so I'm definitely looking at some sort of loan, credit card, or investment. The trouble is that most business loans need 2-3 years of business history for approval and this is for a start-up. 

I recently received a ""pre-approval"" letter in the mail from our credit union for a Visa Platinum card at 0% APR intro rate and 12.99% variable after that. That's about half of the APR that I see in other spammy credit card ads in my mail box. It seems like this may be a really good chance at getting a chunk of the start-up funding I need.

At the same time, I was raised to be really leery of credit cards in general. I've never had one before (I do have student loans and an auto loan on my credit history - all in good standing), so I don't really know what to expect. 

* There's no credit limit listed in the fine-print on this card, but I'm sure it's not an unlimited thing, right? How do I find out what the credit limit is? 
* The business will be a sole proprietorship, so applying for the card under my name is the same as applying under the business name, but would I be better off looking at business credit cards? They don't seem to have better interest rates, as far as I can see. And I read that they don't have a lot of the regulations that consumer cards have, so you can get dicked over by banks this way. 
* Are credit cards as scary and dangerous as I've always been led to believe and would this be a viable way to kickstart a small retail business? 
* The 12.99% is comparable to or lower than the rates of most of the business loans that I've seen - could this be an even better way to fund my business than a high rate loan?

Not sure how many of my questions can be answered here, but any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. I'm pretty noobish in these matters, so I apologize if any of my questions were irritatingly ignorant.

personalfinance,"Student Loans - Consolidation, Income Based Repayment?","I need some advice about my fiance's student loans.  She has about 65K in sub &amp; unsub federal student loans. They are split over about 25 different smaller loans with varying interest rates.  She has been deferring about half of them and on IBR for the other half.  I know that this isn't making any progress.   We will be getting married within the next year and a half.  She's been able to defer them as she doesn't have much of an income.  I have a decent income though, so things will probably change after we get married.  

I'm looking for some advice on what to do.  We could consolidate them all into one loan and pay about $700 a month for 10 years.  I know this results in the least interest paid.  

We could also do an extended period of 25 years where it's more like $450 per month.  

Or she could do one of the IBR plans where she will basically pay nothing until her income rises.   

What does /r/personalfinance thing would make the most sense?  The $700 for the consolidation would be a pretty big stretch. Any other ideas?  

We have no other debt and do not expect to buy a house for the next 5 years.  No kids coming either.  

What about keeping them on IBR, then making larger payments every once in a while to knock off the loans.  

Also, is it possible to pay off the higher interest loans sooner than the lower ones if they are with the same servicing company?",finance,1417042250

Here are my loans:

$4000 @ 5% (quarterly payment of of roughly $130)

$3,500 @ 4.5%

$10,000 @ 3.4%

$9,187 @ 6.8%

$5,500 @ 3.86%

$7,000 @ 3.86%



In total I'll over around $42,500ish with interest. All of my loans are currently set up to pay over 10 years with my federal loans (the last 5) costing me $390 a month starting next month. 

Some basic info, I'm married, just graduate, have a job where I make a gross income of around $37k a year, gross of around $2900 a month. My husband is in his last year in the military, with his gross a month at $2035 ish or roughly $25k a year. He is planning on getting out and the job he is looking at will be a gross of around $65k a year which he will be able to start if all goes well in late 2015, with plenty of room for income growth. 

Anything else that would help, just let me know. I'm interested in loan consolidation, but would that make sense since my %s are so low other than the 6.8? Also, where would be a good place to look for that? I am with Nelnet currently. Any advice would be appreciated!

I also just got eligible for my work's 401k, so if you have advice on that as well, I'd love it. My family has been living paycheck to paycheck my entire life, so now that my husband and I are married and we're not forced to, I need a bit of help on how to plan for the future. Thanks!

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice (Unique Circumstances),"Hi everyone, first time posting in PF (please be gentle) and hoping someone here might be able to help me out. I've tried endless Google searches only to be given everything except what I need. Okay, here it goes:


&amp;nbsp;


I just finished a graduate program, which was funded through a research assistantship over the course of two years. Unfortunately, I was a little slower than average in completing my degree, and my RA funding ran out one semester before I finished my thesis. I made a huge mistake in thinking that my ""thesis credit units,"" as they're called, would not cost tuition, as I wasn't taking any classes or involved at the school in any way (I wasn't even living in the same state). Now here's where it gets a little more complex.

&amp;nbsp;


This semester is still in session, but the day I turned my thesis in, I dropped my student status in order to take advantage of tuition pro-rating, saving myself several thousand dollars. Sadly, I didn't have the foresight to apply for student loans to cover accrued tuition BEFORE I dropped student status, and now I'm not sure if I'll be able to qualify for student loans to pay off the remaining balance on my student account; if I don't pay off the account, I don't get my degree, and I really need my degree to get the good jobs I'm searching for.

&amp;nbsp;


I'm concerned I might be stuck in a catch-22 here. I don't have any experience with private student loans, but am wondering if they or federal student loans have any options for ""non-students"" who need to pay off previously-accrued student debts. If anyone needs any other details in order to better understand my situation, I'm glad to give them. Please, any help is good help for me!

Thank you and regards,

personalfinance,Moving to another city possibly without a job. Advice? Not moving is NOT an option btw.,"I am about to graduate college and while I am actively job searching I may have to move before securing a job. I have a couple potential businesses I can do which are pretty certain and low risk, but I may not be able to start those immediately. 


I have been living at home during college and while I am very grateful for the chance, I cannot stay any longer than graduation for my own sanity. So not leaving is NOT an option. 

Here's the situation:

1. I don't have any debt. no student loans, no credit card debt etc. 
2. I will be coming with at least $2200 but probably a bit more (since relatives will probably give some money gifts for graduating plus they do give for Hanukkah). 
3. I will have clothing but that's about it. I am not planning to get an apartment immediately. probably just going to get a room from craigslist or something. At least temporarily until I can get some income. 
4. I have selected Minneapolis because I can get by without a car, and the city is cheap in general. And from research it seems to be doing fairly well overall. I can take public transit and bike. And because a lot of culture appeals to me. 
5. In this case being a young single Jewish woman fresh out of college will be beneficial because Jews get really excited to have new ones join their community (especially outside of New York because communities in America outside of New York tend to be small). So they will help me (I have been in contact with the Federation and will contact synagogues so I know they will to some extent for sure). I would rather not have to rely on them as much as possible though (and not for everything). 
6. I will not have help from my parents. Even if they were willing to help, they don't have much money because most of my siblings are still at home (and younger than me). My older sister is NYC and doesn't have much help she can give anyway (which is fine) and we are not very close, and the rest of my family is farther in the USA or in Europe. So except for the Jewish federation and any rabbis and synagogues that help, I will be alone. 

I am hoping I can secure a job before moving but if I must go without one I will. Any advice for moving? Especially if I cannot secure a job, but even if I do?

economy,Today I had a small discussion with a local convenience store owner and came to a realization: We are at the Dawn of the Smart Economy.,"I was on my way to the gym today after hitting a local coffee shop when I walked by a convenience store and decided to buy a pack of gum.

 I walked in, said hello to the convenience store clerk, and made my way to the gum section. I grabbed some gum, paid for it, but before leaving the store, to the left of him I noticed a slew of gadgets he was selling. Headphones, USB cables, cell phone chargers, selfie extenders, water humidifiers, bluetooth speakers, you name it. 
 
 Now, I rarely walk into convenience stores, so I'm not sure if its a recent phenomenon. But when I compliment him on his business sense, he goes onto tell me that he does it to adapt to the changing demands of the local geographic. Saying that now, people are buying a lot more technological products more often, and he says it works, mentioning how the local high schools bring in a lot of business during and after school hours. He told me that his prices were even cheaper than big electronic stores like best buy and Wal-Mart. 

He mentioned that it's partial to the fact that his business is losing potential clientele with the ability for consumers to purchase things online with Amazon and the like. And I mentioned that it's only going to get harder. Places like shopping malls will have 3d body scanners to scan our bodies, and we'll be able to try on clothes in virtual space, cutting the need for consumers to even go to shop in the local malls. 

 He told me that it won't happen any time soon.

 I asked him if he knew why Oculus rift was, and he said he didn't knowI told him that Oculus is making virtual reality a reality. And people will be able to see virtual versions of themselves trying on clothes in virtual space. So I showed him a video of someone playing Elite Dangerous in the Oculus Rift. And his reaction was fun to watch. He couldn't believe it. 

 But he still said that the technology wont affect local businesses any time soon, and is far off. 

 So I pulled out my phone, opened the Google Goggles app, and scanned a box of headphones right in front of him. The app took me to Google that showed me the price and reviews of the headphones. The headphones were overpriced, contrary to what he told me. And they had a 3 star rating. 

 I told him to just keep track of technology, adapt accordingly, and he should be fine. People are soon going to be able to instantly know whether they are indeed getting a good deal, and a good product. This is thanks to products like Google Glass, and the fabled Magic Leap that Google recently made a $540 million investment in.

 I told him that soon, within the next few years, people will be walking around with augmented reality visors/goggles/monocles, which will be equipped with an onboard AI that will instantly scan the products and be able to tell you what deals you will be getting. Technology will instantly cut all the bullshit, and give consumers useful information. Making it that much important for local businesses to adapt to the accelerating capabilities of consumers that have access to the latest technologies.

 Now, when I brought up these points to him, he brushed me off and told me that won't happen any time soon. Maybe everything I told him was too overwhelming to process in the span of the few minutes I explained it to him, so I don't blame his reaction.

 But I really feel like the common folk today have no idea just what they are capable of with even today's technology. Many people are unaware of just how powerful that instrument they have in their pocket really is, and how beneficial it can be to them and the people around them if they know how to use it properly.

 I almost didn't say anything to the guy. I usually just run my errands without much interaction with people. But as an /r/futurology regular, I'm beginning to realize the importance of opening people's eyes to the wonders of our technology, and where it is headed. The better informed people are, the better their ability to adapt to society's ongoing evolution. 

To conclude:

Today, consumers are fed information to change and distort their actions or ways of thinking towards one of superficiality in order to get them to buy products, to keep this capitalistic game going.

The medium in which we exchange products for money will change when the quality of information that enters the mind of the consumer when buying products becomes one of higher order. Information that doesn't degrade the self-worth of individuals, but empowers them.

With improving technology, consumers will have an upperhand in a situation where they are exchanging their money for goods and services. Smart consumers will be the dawn of a Smart Economy. It will change things economically for the better. In what ways, I'm not too sure. I'm no economist.",finance,1417061396

I’ve deferred my Fed loans since i don’t make any taxable income (foreign income). This way I can focus on paying off my higher interest credit debt.


I just recently paid off my Citi card. Since then I’ve started throwing $500-1000 at my Discover card each month. But according to some online calculators this will still take me about 2 years to finish off.


I’ve just been offered a 0% balance transfer option on my Citi card for a year with a 3% transfer fee. I know a lot of people on here have suggested to others to apply for 0% transfer cards. I tried that about 3 years ago (that’s why I have the Citi card) but I only got a $1,200 credit line. That was nowhere near enough to help dent my Discover debt. I don’t want to go applying for more credit cards and get all those inquires showing up on my report. Why are people suggesting this option? It doesn’t seem to help much for larger debts.

I live at home and take public transit which my parents pay for, I barely have any expenses and I work at a restaurant so I eat Most meals free.

Since I acquired this debt I started really looking in to managing my money well and different things I can do to make the money I make work for me instead of working so hard to make my money and spending it right away. through my searches and talking to friends I have become extremely interested in real estate investment. more specifically buying and holding residential rental properties for the short term cash flows and long term equities.

My friend has a lot of savings (for a student), roughly 20-25k invested in mutual funds. I have a little bit of savings but a huge debt which means in actuality the savings aren't mine. He recently asked me if I would be interested in being his partner in buying his first rental property sometime in September/October 2015.

My question to you is, do you think I should take him up on his offer, save my money and start investing for my future and worry about paying off the debt later (its a student loan so it has a lower interest rate, and the min. Payments are extremely manageable). Or should I worry about completely paying off my debt before I even think about going at something with this amount of risk?

personalfinance,"Good FICO score, poor creditworthiness. Best way to improve credit history with no loans?","Hi PF.

I'm 24, working my first career out of school with decent pay. I was very fortunate to graduate college without ever taking out a loan due to my amazing parents setting side some education money in a Vanguard account when I was born.


I have two credit cards, both of which I pay off in full every month and have never missed a payment. One card, I've had for 6.5 years (a US Bank student card I got when I was 18) but it only has a $2000 credit limit. The second, I've had for 9 months, with $11000 credit limit. In an attempt to build more history, I applied for a Target card approximately 3 months ago, but was denied due to ""lack of credit history"", which prompted me to do research on credit scores vs. history, etc. My main concern is that with no loan history and only 2 small credit accounts, I will be approved for poor interest rates when applying for a mortgage or other loans in the coming 3-5 years, and will be continually denied for a new CC where I could be receiving more cash back, better rewards, higher credit limit, etc. 


What would be the best way to improve my creditworthiness? One suggestion I've heard is getting a new card with 0% introductory APR, carrying a significant balance and making minimum payments, but making sure to pay it off it in full before interest kicks in. What about asking for a higher credit limit on my current cards? Would that help at all? Should I just be patient and continue paying off in full every month as I do now? Is there any other ways I can improve my creditworthiness?


TL;DR: 760 credit score; no loans ever. Need to build creditworthiness. What do?

After all of this school, I have amassed $123,000 in federal student debt. The average interest rate is about 6.8% for all the loans. Fortunately, my undergraduate and MBA were covered by full scholarships, but my law degree (which sometimes I regret) is the vast majority of my loans.

I just secured a great job in a finance leadership program at a fortune 100 company making 100k (15k signing bonus taxed, at least 10-14k bonus each year) after MBA in May and there is definitely room to grow in salary and position over the next 3-5 years. I have very low monthly expenses &lt;1,900 which includes entertainment/social. ALSO, I have NO other debt.

Because I've been in school for so long and worked in the public sector for a couple years, I have little to no savings and have not been able to do any investing (12,000 of my debt will be capitalized--no resources to pay interest).

personalfinance,What are the chances of refinancing a high interest auto loan only a few months into it?,"So background:

I make 70k a year. 

My monthly expenditures are currently only ~$1000 so income isn't a problem.

I have been planning to buy a new car for a while now, I have decent sized saving the problem is I have been a cash person my entire life, therefore I have a blank slate as far as credit goes. (Absolutely zero debt, nothing.) 

Currently the only loan offer I've gotten has been in the double digits. 

I am already planning to hit up a friend's credit union on Friday.

My original plan was to just pay it off really quickly, making 2-3x over the normal payment and getting the car paid off in a year or so, but even then at double digit interest rates I am looking at adding another grand+ to the total. 

I've read about people who, after making payments on time for 3-4 months refinanced from 12+% to 3-7%, how likely is that? Were they just lucky? 

I am not really interested in buying an old used car, that's what I've got now and it's looking at probably 3000+ in repairs in the next few months and just isn't worth the trouble anymore. 

Thoughts? Would paying 1k/mo on it for 3-4 months increase the chance of a refinance?

personalfinance,Too many hits on my CB? (CA),"I have been working really hard at getting my CB score up and have succeeded (yay me!). I got a new credit card back in June, which was my last CB hit. 

I work at a bank and when I called about a few transactions on my debit card, they advised me that I could get the employee interest rate on a PLC, which is very good. Now I already have a PLC with a different bank that is now closed, and I am in the process of paying it off. The employee rate is a bit lower than the interest rate on my existing PLC, so I said lets do it and my CB was pulled. After the fact, I was advised that because I was on contract and now a fulltime employee, I wouldn't be able to get the employee interest rate, and all I qualified for was a rate well above what I'm currently paying on my PLC. So basically my CB was hit for no reason. 

Now, before all this happened, I wanted to apply for a new CC that offers alot of rewards and a welcome bonus for travel points. I was planning on just closing my existing card because I don't need two.

How bad is it that my CB will be hit three times in a year? Is there anything I can do?

Bitcoin,FutureCoin,"The forever coin

it becomes apparent that with this technology we are capable of creating an algorithm that can incorporate some of the pragmatic mechanisms that have proven useful in a currency.


And granted I might be drunk on thanksgiving foods and wine buy fuckit, this is forever and the open source will filter everything for the good because onward. 

And if you doubt it, then entropy. 

So, the beginnings of the thought. Build a currency that works within some of the obvious mechanisms that we knows works. 

If people stop spending money, decrease the value of money so people spend it. 

This is a direct response to the problem of deflation with bitcoin. Yes. The current algorithm, as far as we know it, will eventually lead to the point where bitcoins will no longer be mined, and the limited supply may cause a deflationary spiral. 

Fuck knows if its true. The point is to design into the system a countermeasure of the human condition.

One of the mains, in terms of currency, is hoarding. Indeed, it is entirely possible that the limited amount of bitcoins can create a hoarding problem. Yes, perhaps, there is some mechanism for other currencies to exist to fill in the in between..... but I don't see it. The only way that a cryptocurrency can survive a deflationary spiral is if there is enough of a secondary currency to inflate the spiral.

And if we're going to depend on a secondary currency, then what the hell is the point?



So I really hope your thanksgiving was a good thanksgiving, cause mine was. But back to the point.

We all witnessed the ability of a centralized system to prop up an economy.... the fed just printed money for the past 8 years? Or whatever. All in all, that concept works. I mean, perhaps it doesn't provide the immediate relief for everyone, but the system doesn't collapse.

And really thats the goddamn key, isn't it?


So I guess thats the point. Build into the algorithm a mechanism that can fight any type of trend towards shit. Because ultimately thats the point, is it not? Decentralize by integration. Make it innate. No one decides these breakpoints besides the algorithm itself. 

I mean, our federal currency has no real goddamn value besides the value we give it. And the value we give it is founded in the fact that we really don't want things to go to shit. And who wants things to go to shit? And granted, the phoenix may rise, but the sacrifice?  Not worth it. Humanity is precious. So lets make it work.



All right. So if you've made it this far, thanks. I'm really just rambling, but thats the point of this medium isn't it?

The ultimate point is we know that printing money works. So how do we integrate into the algorithm a mechanism to print money based on the behavior of the markets?

And this is where a real economist needs to step into the equation,  but I'll give it a stab.

But at the same time, this is where the P2P mechanism of cryptocurrency shines. Because if this alternative is adopted, all it takes is 51% of the network to make it real.

Solo mine for the network. 

Okay, so what does it end up being?

So, the blockchain can monitor all the transactions occurring, right? Thats its thing. Public ledger. If the public ledger measures a dip in transactions, thats an indication that people are hoarding. 

They are not trading currency for goods. 

As much as this bites into every element that is the next evolution of humankind, the fact of the matter is that this works. Despite the eviles of contemporary economics, people are the best they've been on this planet since the dawn of time. 

So the move in the algorithm is to convince people to exchange their currency for goods. 

We currently do this with centralized banking systems by printing money (that 0% rate that banks enjoy).

So why not integrate into a cryptocurrency the ability to recognize a period of inactivity as an oppurtunity to print more money?

In reality, the manifestation probably runs as such:

1. Coin is born, mining progresses conventionally (adoption)
2. Coin meets max point, coin stops being created.
3. Coin is created if money movement decreases

Basically, the slang code is as such:

Measure market transactions
If market transactions &lt; (some percentage), set newcoin=15*(some percentage*100)
Provide newcoins to next block

Are you picking up what I'm putting down?


Goddamn. This is where the coders and the economists need to really hash it out. Just have a goddamn coffee, please. Get manic and make it real.

investing,About falling oil prices &amp; what you should do with oil producing companies,"* You should sell all small caps oil companies that do not have a hedging program in place. All of them are going bankrupt or won't recover due to crippling debts/wasted capex. At best you'll break even in 5+ years.
* If you do manage to find a small cap oil producer with strong 2015/2016 hedges that is selling at a discount, yes, you can buy it. China's demand for oil is still growing, US shale oil is getting obliterated (some need to sell at $125 to be profitable!) and production in the US will go lower.
* Overall, most small cap producers can't produce a profit from $67 oil barrel. They will have to shut their doors once the hedging program ends unless the gov bails them out, which it won't. 
* The most efficient oil producer in the US can be profitable at $35 per barrel. The most efficient oil producer in Saudi Arabia can be profitable at $2+shipping by barrel.
* A oil producer that closes its doors incurs massive costs for simply maintaining its installation and employees and with no revenue, well...
* Oil is the most manipulated commodity on Earth. In 2007-2008, when the price was manipulated to $148, one single guy traded 10% of all oil contracts. That's several trillions of dollars of trade values.
* That being said, now is a great time to grab big oil producers. Enbridge, Haliburton and so on are not going anywhere and will recover quickly with oil prices.
* Oil is extremely volatile and could go anywhere. Lybia, Iran and so on will reduce their output as prices falls, as they have a limited amount of oil and won't sell it at $67 today if they can sell at $80 in a year. Low interest rates favor this.
* Do buy midstream and downstream companies at a discount. Those do not depend on oil prices AT ALL.",finance,1417199639

I am sure student loans are a very hot topic on this subreddit, but I am new here and after some brief searching I wan't able to find what I was looking for.

My situation is I currently  have a loan through Wells Fargo. I have 70k in student debt, the interest rate is 6.75% and the monthly payments are $574, with just over 22 years left on the loan.

I have been considering refinancing through Citizens Bank, and I have rate quotes from them as low as 3.86% (variable rate). 

My multi-part question is does it make sense to take a slightly higher monthly payment for a shorter term, or to take a longer term with a lower monthly payment and then pay more on it. The rate on the longer term would be 4.08% and the shorter term rate would be 4.02%. I've done some calculations (thanks to Mint) and it seems that the outcome would be the same in this case and it wouldn't matter which I chose which makes me favor the longer term loan with a lower monthly payment where I pay more a month, just in case I'm ever in a situation where I cannot make the higher payment.

Being as I'm 19 years old and have no credit, that was my only option to get me in a car asap which I desperately needed because I work about 11 miles away from where I live. Because this place sells cars to risky buyers they really overprice the vehicles and charge a way high interest rate. Pretty much they sold me a car that was worth 2,500 for about 10,000 after interest. I thought that was the price of convience and I was fine with it because making payments would help me build good credit and the payments were more than affordable. And in two years I'd own a car I could drive until it's dead while I save for a much nicer car. I didn't think that less than two months later some guy would come flying down this hill, enter in my lane, and smash my car onto a curb and into two street signs and total my car. While dealing with insurance stuff and filing claims this woman from my insurance tells me what could happen in my situation. 1- I could owe less on my car than it's worth and make a little money from the insurance payout or 2- I owe more than my car was worth and I will still owe the remaining amount on the loan unless I have...

I have $33,000 in student loans/car debt/etc. We want to pay her back in 11 installments of $3,000/month.

These are some of the potential options we have come up with:

1) Only borrow (a gift of) $28,000 in 2015 and gift back $28,000 in 2015. Thus we would not need to file anything because we are gifting each other the money. Would this be tax evasion? Or is it within our rights to do this?

2) She lends us $33,000 in a loan, charging the federal interest rate minimum of .34% and we make the 11 monthly installments. If she were to give us the money in 2014, and we didn't start paying her until 2015 (and would complete payments in 2015), is there anything she would need to list in her 2014 taxes? What does she need to list in her 2014/2015 taxes? She will make about $55 in interest over the life of the loan.

3) Are there specifications to how the interest must be paid? Each month, the average per month, or a balloon payment at the end?

Advice?","So I moved to the San Francisco bay area in May from Toronto, Canada for a job in software (~$100k salary). I'm 24 and graduated officially this year from university after taking an extra 16 months for an internship between my third and fourth years and an extra year to get a credit I missed and couldn't get anywhere else.

I was able to pay off all school from what I earned during my internship and by doing TA work, so I don't have any debt.

Right now my situation is somewhat complicated because my money is in both American and Canadian accounts. The only real self-motivated ""investing"" I've done is transfer $6,000 USD to Canada a little while ago since the exchange rate is so favourable due to the falling price of oil (I think). My plan is to transfer it back when the Canadian dollar rises again and make ~$400.

My Canadian money is currently divided between Tangerine accounts and Scotiabank accounts like this:

    Tangerine Chequing Account: ~$2,000 CAD
    Tangerine Savings Account: ~$9,000 CAD
    Tangerine RSP Savings Account: ~$16,500 CAD
    Tax-Free Savings Account: ~$1,200 CAD

    Scotiabank TFSA: ~$5,300 CAD

So total, roughly $34,000 CAD. (I'll put up the interest rates later; Tangerine's site went down for maintenance right when I posted this...)

The Scotiabank TFSA was created by my parents back when I was a teenager, is invested in the ""dynamic american value fund"" and seems to do really well (it's book value is $3,900).

My American money is more vaguely divided for me:

    Chase Total Checking: $1,500
    Fidelity 401k: ~$3,600
    Cigna HSA thingy: ~$200
    CapitalOne Platinum Secure MasterCard: ~$850 

The money in the CapitalOne thing is essentially trapped to give me a credit limit of exactly $1,000

So total, roughly $6,150.

I had a time limit to get my 401k setup, so I basically just chose investments based on what people told me is generally good. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ZkCc62T.png) is how it's currently invested. I heard you can invest the HSA too, but I don't know if it's worth figuring out, seeing as it contains so little. The company I work for is also transitioning to Aetna in the new year, so I'm not sure I want to touch it.

I just got approved for a Chase Freedom unsecured card with a $500 limit, so I'm hoping to be able to eventually cancel the CapitalOne card and get the money back from it. The only reason I'm with CapitalOne is because I had zero US credit history when I arrived.

So my questions are as follows:

 * Does it make sense to have accounts in both Canada and the US? I'm a dual citizen, so I'm not particularly tied to either country.
 * Is transferring excess cash to Canada a good idea, or is this somehow a bad investment?
 * How should I invest better? The general trend I noticed in the 401k is that small/mid tier business investments seem to do better, so I adjusted things not too long ago to put a higher percent into that. Other than that, I'm pretty sure my Tangerine savings accounts are operating as ordinary savings account, which probably isn't optimal.

**EDIT:** I should also add, I'm maxing out my employer's match contribution to my 401k.",finance,1417243187
personalfinance,"My ""Financial Adviser"" tried to sell me on a Pyramid scheme and I feel I made a terrible mistake","***tl;dr: Financial Advisor tried to sell me on a pyramid scheme and I lost my trust in her and am looking for advice on dealing with my debt. Which is why I'm here and not asking her for advice. I dont know how to balance having an emergency fund with paying down my loans and am looking for advice***

*(story time, skip to below for questions)
*So, about 2 years ago I met a financial adviser (FA) looking to have a website made. I don't often work for barter but her website was simple and I was wanting to get started with saving for retirement. I was 27 at the time (29 at present) and had a stable job making 35k a year. 

So I worked out a barter with FA and she set up a Roth IRA for me through Cambridge that started small but had regular contributions. 

Then I quit my job and took a new one that paid more money. When I called Cambridge to change my address they said I had to do so through my FA. I contact her about it and it never happened.

The new job ended up not being as long term as I had hoped (start-up that made money but where the owner decided to run with the money) and so I moved back home. I tell her again to change my address and that I moved back home. She says she has a job opportunity for me. 

So we meet, and it's a pyramid scheme. I was livid that my FA would be so daft as to buy into that and then try to sell me on it. 

This was a few months ago, I've not heard from her since. My IRA mail is still arriving months late from being forwarded through who-knows-where. All I want is to remove her entirely from this but Cambridge says I need her to do as little a thing as change my address. 

**Which is a long winded way of explaining why I'm here asking you guys for advice instead of her.

Below are my account details. I currently work a meager job making ~150/wk and then I make ~100-1000 a month in passive income from that start up (at least I worked royalties into that contract, eh?)

My questions are, how do I manage these loans I have? Mostly student loans. I don't want to pay an extra $3,000 in interest per loan. That's insane! 

I have enough to either a) pay my car loan off out right b) pay my private loans (AES) off out right or c) pick and choose some of the federal loans to pay off outright 

but if I choose either of those options I will not have the emergency funds necessary in event of an emergency. 

I could also sell my car as it's worth 2-2.5k more than I currently owe on it and then buy a junker. But I really like my car but it's a scenario I've been entertaining. 

I dunno how to balance having an emergency fund with paying down my loans. It's even more difficult to figure out without a proper 40hour a week job paying me a salary. any advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Paying income tax versus Paying student loans,"I currently live in Alberta, Canada but I went to a grad school in the states. This is my first year working a real full time job and I'm finding out just how heavy my loans are. My student loans are massive and at 7.9% interest rate. Because I am an independent contractor, I usually pay my income tax in bulk by end of April. I read on the Canadian tax site that if I am unable to pay my income tax, they will set up a payment plan for me based on my income/expenses and a 5% interest rate. 

So my question is: should I purposely use all my income to whittle away at my student loans so when April comes around, I have no money to pay my tax, thereby giving me a debt with 5% instead of 7.9% interest rate? Am I missing some fees or penalties?",finance,1417274458
Bitcoin,OffNow movement to shut down the surveillance state looking for bitcoin participation,"Michael Boldin of OffNow.org contacted me for clarification on how to approach this community in order to achieve their modest goals of keeping operations going with the help of generous bitcoiners.

OffNow is an action group designed to make the NSA's illegal and unconstitutional actions in the USA more difficult by, of all other things, shutting down basic utilities to their compounds. They succeeded in several states so far and are apparently gaining ground but have a few grand a month in operational expenses they need to keep making life miserable for the NSA.

For information about what they do, visit OffNow.org. For the lazy or web crawlers,

&gt; The Surveillance State has an Achilles Heel
&gt; 
&gt; How can average people like you and I confront a massive surveillance-state with the power to spy on virtually everybody in the world?
&gt; 
&gt; With cameras peering down at nearly every street corner, and the NSA vacuuming up and storing away staggering amounts of data, it can seem very daunting. And it continues to grow. Primarily funded, nurtured and operated from the federal level, mass surveillance trickles down to your community at a staggering pace.
&gt; 
&gt; But the American surveillance-state has an Achilles Heel.
&gt; 
&gt; It needs help and resources.
&gt; 
&gt; These spy-programs cannot continue to expand without participation and assistance from the state and local level.
&gt; 
&gt; We can turn it off.
&gt; 
&gt; By passing legislation - state by state – we can thwart mass surveillance without relying on Congress or Supreme Court.
&gt; 
&gt; Legislatively, OffNow focuses on four main areas
&gt; 
&gt;    Banning material support. This includes stopping the flow of state supplied resources like water and electricity to federal agencies conducting mass, warrantless surveillance. See video below.
&gt;
&gt;    Prohibiting warrantless data sharing.  In the Bush-era, the federal government enacted numerous laws largely turning state and local law enforcement agents into warrantless data transmitters for the national surveillance state, primarily via SOD and Fusion Centers. OffNow works to pass laws via ballot measures and regular legislation to prohibit such activities.
&gt;
&gt;    Ending warrantless location tracking.  Through the use of ""Stingrays"" and other similar tools, federal and local agencies illegally collect location information from your cellphone. Once collected, these agencies share this information back and forth. Police at the local level also use license-plate readers as tracking devices.  OffNow supports legislation to restrict and eventually eliminate these practices.
&gt;
&gt;    Stopping warrantless drone spying. Drones can serve as valuable tools, but in the hands of law enforcement, they can quickly become a tool of abuse. OffNow works to support legislation restricting or eliminating the use of drones by state and local entities.

It's easy to see that their goals are absolutely in line with those of bitcoiners of present day and their hard work and bravery should not be ignored or punished by our inaction.

Mark will be here sometime to post an AMA and prove himself to the community but this is a heads up to people like Roger Ver and others who have money and claim to want to give it to good causes. In 2014, there will mot likely be a better cause than to dismantle the sadistic, overreaching and corrupt NSA, the same organization that seeks to make bitcoiners' identities and activities known to themselves for what has historically been proven to be blackmail and persecution lists.

personalfinance,Financial Advise for a Senior in High School (US),"As of now, I am an 18 year old Senior in a Charter High School in South Florida. I'm in no danger of being out on the streets after graduation and I currently have no debt or any significant financial history or credit or any of that jazz. I do, however, want to be financially secure in my future because the mere thought of going through what others in my family have terrifies me to no end.

At present, I have a part time job at Dominos as a Customer Service Representative (CSR) making minimum wage working every day of the week including holidays except Mon &amp; Thurs from around 5:30pm to 8 pm. I hate it, but I will probably stick with it unless I find something better. My GPA in schoool is pretty decent: weighted: 4.2, unweighted: 3.1ish and I plan on going to college. This is where things get a little sticky and I need the help.

My father told me that after graduation he would give me 4k to do with what I will. Initially, I planned on a trip out of the country for enrichment but then he started talking to me about maybe going to San Diego for a 6 month coding boot camp which costs around 12k. He said while I would have to take out a student loan and accrue a small debt, it would make me skilled and immediately employable before college where I would likely have to take out another student loan to pay for the college I want to go to (Likely Savannah College of Art and Design, Ringling College of Art and Design, or University Southern California). Plus, having that skill would help me pay for that stuff and survive.

When I think about it, it makes sense. But then I take into account getting to San Diego...and living on my own in California with help being on the other side of the country in Florida and having nobody I know...no friends to fall back on and no experience in anything except Dominos with nothing but a High School diploma and potentially no car (if I take a flight and don't drive there. I may drive there, but I don't know how I'd stretch that 4k on gas, food and miscellaneous expenses on the way across the country, let alone if I take a friend for company.) to speak of.

If I settled in California (which has a higher cost of living than Florida, I believe), I don't know how I'd stretch 4k + what little I make from my job considering I'd have to do so much in a place I've never been to with no help plus the fact that I'd likely be 12k in debt plus the interest rate...",finance,1417279833

personalfinance,"Medical Clinic gave me the runaround, need advice","A few months ago, I went in for my yearly checkup and expressed some concerns about my menstrual cycle and that I had been having some pain. The doctor gave me a referral for a transvaginal ultrasound. However, I didn't get around to going in for it until last week. I called and made the appointment, and was very clear exactly what I was making it for. This is a clinic with multiple branches (Radiology, Allergy, general sick visits, etc.) so I wanted to make sure that I wasn't billed for more than what I wanted. 

Cue the appointment time, I went up to the window and was told that due to their policy, I would need to fork over cash for the visit ($90). I have a HDHP insurance, and haven't met my deductible, so I thought 'no biggie, whatever"" and paid for it. I checked with my insurance prior to the visit and the cost was expected to be around $100 total (contracted cost between the clinic and the insurance) However, what I didn't know at the time was that they were NOT sending me directly to radiology for the ultrasound, but rather to an exam room with a general practitioner. I told him that I made the appointment for an ultrasound, I had already been seen about this issue a few months prior and he would absolutely not listen to me. He gave me this HUGE runaround and was about to give me a pap smear until I told him for the THIRD time that I had already had it done this year! Clearly, he did not look at my file and really didn't do much of anything but take me back out to the office to get the mess sorted out. 

This is where I fucked up. I should have left then and there and tried a different place, but I was tired and I've been putting it off for quite some time. They finally got it sorted out and a few minutes of waiting later I was in radiology getting the ultrasound done. Again, I only asked for a transvaginal but while I was having it done, the technician was like ""and now we do a transabdomial one,"" to which she immediately started doing it before I could object. By this point, I was a bit tiffed as I ONLY wanted the transvaginal. At this point, it was like no one was listening to me and I felt like they were only adding on extra costs for things I did not ask for.

The claim has went through to my insurance and there is the visit to the GP along with the transabdomial. I don't mind paying what I asked for (the transvaginal) but I'm feeling like they are trying to milk as much money out of me as possible.

I did talk to my insurance and they said there was nothing they could do as they were essentially there just to process the claim and I'd have to take it up with the clinic.

Their billing office is closed (obviously) and I know that my next step is to talk to them, but I was wondering if you guys could give me any advice on this in case they are not willing to take off the charges? I'm fine paying for the ultrasound that I went in for, but not for what they are trying to tack on. I'm annoyed by all of this because I JUST paid off my student loans last month and I currently have no other debt to speak of. My credit is over 750 so if this went to collections it would completely tank over charges that aren't really that high, but I can't justify paying for as they will not give me my results (as of today) and giving me things I did not ask for.

For reference, I'm in Georgia. The charges are as follows:

-$68 for ''seeing'' the GP

-$132 for transabdomial

-$132 for transvaginal

I've been seeing a few posts here where individuals who make way more than me are still having trouble balancing their finances and that makes me kinda nervous. Like most 22 year olds, I don't really know anything about personal finance besides the obvious principle of ""don't spend more than you make"". I guess what I'm worried about is being met with unforseen financial obstacles once I move out on my own, so I just wanted some feedback on my current situation.



**Info:**
I'm 22 and will be starting an entry level career position next week. It pays a salary of $57k, full benefits, 401k, etc. I've read that ~70% of the gross salary is a good estimate for take home pay - so I'm estimating a monthly income of about $3,325. 

**Expenses**

Rent: $1294/mo for a 1 bedroom apartment less than 4 miles from where I work. Cable/internet and valet waste is included but I'll have to pay utilities separately (estimated $75/month). This is the item I'm most concerned about since its obviously the most expensive and I've already signed the lease... This apartment is also unfurnished, so I'll need to take care of that as well.


Debt: I have around $6.8k in student loans with an interest rate of 6.8%. I'd like to get this paid off ASAP since I hate the idea of just giving them free money... I don't have any credit card debt, or even a credit card for that matter, although I'll be getting one sometime within the next couple weeks (recommendations welcome).


Car: I don't have a car payment, yay. But, my car is a 2002 toyota with over 200k miles on it so I'm not sure how much longer it will last me (Honestly, I really want a new one but I'm willing to wait) I got a quote from Geico for a $44/month policy with good enough coverage


**Other**

Gym - $40/month

Food - $500/month (most likely an overestimation, but I like to cook and I prefer higher quality ingredients)

Phone - I have Verizon but I'm on a parents plan so I have no idea if/when I'll have to get one of my own

Entertainment - $250 I don't really go out much but when I do I tend to spend about $50+ a night on drinks or whatever. I'm also a fan of scotch/bourbon/beer and that can get pretty expensive.

For necessary expenses I've estimated ~$2,000/month (Rent, Utilities, Car Insurance, Food) leaving me ~$1300/month to play with, not including my loan payments. For some reason I feel like I am missing some things, but what?! I don't want to move out and all of a sudden, ""SURPRISE mofucka!! You're poor""

2. 1000 at 5.75%
3. 3130 at 5.35%
4.5500 at 4.250%

These loans don't show the added interest. Instead they shows the principle and then a total accrued interest of 3,539.98 for all loans.


UAS Perkins Loans:


1. 2853.33 at 5.0%
2. 652.05 at 5.0%

I'm planning on paying off the unsubsidized before I pay off the subsidized. Would this be the correct method?

My interest rates will go up when I lose my SCRA benefits but am not sure to what interest rate they will raise to and is why I think it may be better to pay off the variable interest rate loans first. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance,1417290762

personalfinance,Student Looking to reduce interest,"Hello PF, 

This is my first post here, and i'm just looking for some simple financial help. 

I will be graduating college soon, and I have about $20k in student loans from the federal government. I will be eligible for $25k loan after graduation because of my field of study. 

My current Debts:

 * Direct Subsidized Stafford - $3000 @  3.4%
 * Direct UnSubsidized Stafford - $2000 @ 6.8%
 * Direct UnSubsidized Stafford - $6000 @ 6.8%
 * Direct UnSubsidized Stafford - $7500 @ 3.86%

If I do not qualify for a loan repayment program, my next best solution would be as follows: 

I would be eligible for up to $25 with a maximum interest rate of 2.99% for 60 months. 

Would it be worth it for me to basically ""Refinance"" by transferring the balance to the lower interest rate loan? 

Ultimately I want to be able to pay off the balance of my loans within 2.5 years of graduating. 

Thank you!",finance,1417293839
Bitcoin,Please help a Bitcoin-sceptic,"First off, I'm a Bitcoin-sceptic, if that is a word. When I hear people talk about Bitcoin, it's mostly people talking about how it's supposed to take over the world and rid us of fiat currency, but I can't see how it can, and even if we would want it to. A variable money supply means central banks can set interest rates high enough to discourage banks from investing too much in startup companies, and risking overheating the economy, while setting it low enough that they still are gonna invest in some. Removing that tool from the central bank means that we will have an even bigger boom/bust economy.

I realize that a decentralized banking system, which a pure Bitcoin-economy will be, means that there will be lower banking fees, but I don't think that is a big enough advantage for Bitcoins for us to blow up the financial sector and build it up around Bitcoins

So please, convince me that we should work for more Bitcoin and less fiat currency",cryptocurrency,1417296331
personalfinance,"Lost job, new business slow, Credit Card debt high","I'm a IT contractor in California and lost most of my well paying gigs earlier this year. At the same time my wife had to close her business.     
Last year we made 100K+ in profit but we didn't have any savings yet (paying back loans that helped start previous business).     
So when we started a new business we had to dip into credit cards. It started out well, and we made enough money to live on and pay down as much as we could on the cards. We cut down on eating out and other personal expenses. After a few months business became slow and we still have $45k on a 9% credit card and about 8k on a 20% card.    
We are going to move out of the city to escape the high rent but this may also mean that we'll have even less income as we might loose our business in the process.     
We are trying to figure out what to do next.    
- Both credit cards are in my wife's name.    
- She has 750+ credit score and never defaulted on a loan or payment     
- We also have 16K in federal taxes outstanding from 2013. We just arranged a $230 / month payment plan    
     
We want to pay back as much as we can, but I want to start exploring options with regards to the credit cards. What are the effects of us not paying it back and canceling the cards? My wife's credit will take a hit obviously, but can they take our car? (The only asset of value that we own). What else could we expect to happen?     
We're thinking about this as an alternative as to avoid having to file bankruptcy.

Mistake 1: Dumb mistake. I neglected to include one of my W2s for $4,800. Still not sure how I made such a basic mistake after years of doing my taxes myself online. 

Mistake 2: I claimed an education credit (line 49) and wrote in $1,247 on my return. The IRS corrected it and turned it into $0. 

My question is with the education credit... I filed for the lifetime learning credit, as I was going to grad school at the time and thought my tuition fell under the eligibility requirements. I received loans to cover tuition and began making payments September 2012. I also have the 1098-t form from that year, and only line 2 is filled out, which is the line that says ""amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses"". I was in school from January-August 2012, and covered my tuition with federal loans. As stated above, in September 2012, I got a job and began making payments.

Anyway... Has anyone else had this happen? Do you get the credit based on loan repayments? I can't seem to find the answer to that question on the IRS website. 

**Edit: THANK YOU ALL for your responses! I was freaking out last night because I felt overwhelmed and like I was woefully uneducated in the problem.

personalfinance,"Semi-complicated US tax question regarding employer-paid benefits for my domestic partner, turned spouse.","In order to be compliant with the new federal healthcare mandate, I added my now-husband (then long-term domestic partner) to my employer-sponsored healthcare plan during our 2013 open enrollment. This allowed him to begin coverage on January 1, 2014. I work for a university which offers full benefits to both same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners, so it seemed like a no-brainer, especially because he works for a tech start-up that doesn't offer benefits. 

It turns out the employer-paid benefits were significant, over 600$/mo, which my employer paid to have my (then) domestic partner insured. Little did I know, that all of these employer-paid benefits would be considered as TAXABLE INCOME because we were not married, and as a ""not-spouse"", any money my employer paid to insure my partner was treated like extra income (i.e. my federal taxable gross income exceeded my gross income). This resulted in me shelling out an additional $300 in federal taxes every month. 

This where things get complicated--my (then) partner and I are pragmatic. We were planning to get married anyway, have been living together for several years, and we realized that now there was a real financial incentive to do it, so we did. In April 2014, we tied the knot. I immediately sent the ""Qualified Life Event"" form to my HR department letting them know I was now married and my health insurance would change accordingly. 

It took HR approximately 1 month for this change to get finalized, all the while I was getting taxed on each paycheck for the additional ""employer-paid benefits"", which as far as I can tell should not have been treated as additional income--now those benefits were being used in insure my newly-wedded spouse.  HR did *not* seem to care when I brought this up to them. They said I needed to just wait until the change went through.

So, given this strange situation, here are my questions:

* When doing my 2014 taxes, how can I make sure my federal taxable gross income does NOT include the employer-paid benefits from the first month that we were married (even though they will likely show up as extra income such on my W2, as they did on my paystubs).

* Will it be possible to recoup ALL of the costs that were treated as extra income to cover my (then) partner's health insurance because we DID get married during the 2014 tax year, and plan to submit our taxes as ""Married, Filing Jointly"" for the 2014 tax year. 

* What forms, or IRS publications should I be looking at? I tend to do my own taxes (even did this while I was a small business owner and they were tricky), but given this tricky situation, should I seek help from a certified tax-professional this year?

The job itself is important but is less transferable to other companies that are not in the same industry and the overall promotion structure is EXTREMELY RIGID, If I'm lucky I can expect to make 20% more than what I'm making now if I stay. I probably would be happy if it weren't for the nearly 100K in student loans I will start to have to pay back.

The refund was about $2k.  I figured I should put the refund toward my student loan, then I was thinking about putting it into my Roth IRA instead.  Best case scenario would be I get my loans forgiven and get ahead on my retirement (I'm planning on teaching, so I'll need it).

Take home per fortnight is $1,866.27 (100%) (1% = 18.66)
Rent will be 246.49 a fortnight (13.25% paying half with my partner paying other half)
my current bulls are Internet at $30/fortnight (1.105%) and Phone at 37.50/fortnight (2.65%)
Fuel I calculate at approximately $75/fortnight (4.01%) with the same allotted to groceries.

My largest debt is my car payments, at $460.68/Fortnight (24.68%)

I'd appreciate it if you could reserve judgment regarding our situation - this sub has given me a lot of great information and a real wake-up call as to what we need to do so we can be financially healthy.

My fiance and I are in our late 20s and are getting married next October. We are in the process of combining finances, and I sat down today to make a spreadsheet to help us create a strategy for paying down our debts, as I will be primarily responsible for managing the bills and our budget. We both have a substantial amount of credit card debt, which is our first priority, in addition to student debt and his car loan, which we are hoping to refinance to get a better rate next year once his credit score is higher. I am trying to use the avalanche method of paying things down for each, as it seems to be the most effective. 

This is where my questions come in: first, my fiance had some serious financial issues before we met, which led to a series of closed credit card accounts. He has a few open accounts that carry balances, but are current. I went through and got the interest rate for each account, so I am wondering - is there any difference between paying down a closed account vs an open account? My first thought is that an interest rate is an interest rate, whether the account is closed or not, so it would make the most sense to tackle them in that order, rather than looking at them from an open vs. closed standpoint. Is this the correct line of thinking?

Also - how does getting married/combining finances affect credit, if at all? Is there any advantage/disadvantage to listing each other as authorized users on all of our active credit accounts? If it makes any difference, my credit scores are 30-50 points higher than his are right now, and we are hoping to qualify for a mortgage in 1-2 years.

Then I wind up in jail. Not convicted, just in jail. For self defense from a guy who damn near killed me. Seriously, I was bleeding all over the place, and the cops bought the assholes excuse that my injuries were ""self-inflicted."" Go figure.


Fast forward.

I wind up with $3,850.00 in medical bills; with no insurance, I'd assumed that the authorities would have been required to pay for my medical expenses... the hospital disagrees. Now I've got the Attorney General demanding me to pay this money when I was a pre-trial detainee who was basically forced to go to the hospital by the police. But who cares.

Next problem: My loans... I had taken out 2 loans and was planning on using a portion of the loan with lower interest to pay for the loan with higher interest. That, obviously, didn't work out because I got put in jail, for, about 5 months.

Those loans make me liable for ~$7,400.

$2,200 @3.5% interest
$5,400 @4.25% interest.

Apparently, the group that had given me the loans got bought out, and now the interest rate has gone up. Great.

That money is basically gone; living expenses and tuition... crap.

The College claims I owe them ~$2,000 as well; for the difference of the grant I got due to my not attending classes due to being locked up.

I'm not some loser and am willing to work; unemployment is about 40% of the population in my age range where I am and there aren't many jobs. About 20% of the population where I am relies on SNAP benefits; I have one month before I'm required to volunteer for free (20hrs a week,) in order to continue eating.

The last job I had was selling solar to homes; the company stopped giving me hours, didn't bother to fire me, and refuses to pay my commission (for 5 solar systems.)

My family refuses to help me, and have stuck their head in the sand.

I have $20; how do I make it grow? I can't afford insurance or gas at this time. I know about basic concepts like leverage/gearing.

My expenses are roughly $10K per month for regular stuff, $10K per month for taxes, $5K per month for shit that just comes up which leaves about $10K left over.

I have a mortgage that is $560K first mortgage and a $75K second mortgage on a house that Zillow tells me is worth just under $1 million.  I bought the house 10 years ago on a 7-year ARM that is in the variable bit and has a really low interest as you can imagine (2.5% I think) although the 2nd is quite high (7.2%).

I have a couple of credit cards that I used to carry balances on, but now I pay them off each month.  One is used pretty heavily for business (about $13K per month of expenses).  So at any given point in time I have a balance of $15-20K on my credit cards out of a limit of $35K.

My FICO scores are 705, 728 and 738.  Mostly b/c of the tax liens and the credit usage (which sorta assumes a carried balance I guess).

(1) Seems like I should refi my mortgages. I've let it be (really b/c I'm lazy) but I rationalize it by the weighted average interest rate being quite low.  Any suggestions on that?  
(2) How should I finance a new car?  I could refi the house and buy a car with excess cash?  Or just do a car loan?
(3) Is there anything I should do about the tax liens other than just wait another 5 years for the clock to run out?
(4) Last month I started putting $10K per month in index funds in Betterment. (cool service btw).  Is there anything nifty else I could do?
(5) I need to treat saving for retirement and kid (have one 9 year old) seriously.  ""Plan"" is $10K per month and then equity value of my business.  Any other thoughts?

Monthly income - 1,700

personalfinance,Should I really be paying off my interest while I'm a student?,"I hear this all the time, but there's something that seems really weird to me. Maybe you guys can clear it up.

If I need exactly $X to get through the year, and that will accrue $Y of interest during the year, then to pay it off, I actually need to take out $X+Y in loans. Which then increases the interest even more, to $Y+Z.

It's always seemed to me that I should take out the least amount possible for my loans. And by definition, if I'm paying off my interest, I didn't take out the least amount possible. So, is it really a good idea to take out *larger loans* just so I can pay off the interest?

---

Ok, I did the math, it was super complicated but if anybody cares I can try to write it out for you guys. Calculated assuming interest rate is &lt;= 10%

Basically, **if you attend/defer for 4 years or less, paying off interest will cost you money.**

**If you attend/defer for 4.5 years or more, paying off interest will save you money.**

If you are slightly above 4 years, the difference will be negligible. For example, for 5 years at 6% interest, paying off will have saved me 0.2% at the time that I start paying. However, if you're going to graduate/dropout early and start payments 3.5 years after you entered college, at 6% interest, paying off while in school will end up **costing** you a whopping 15%!",finance,1417362928

personalfinance,"20 and Male, looking at a potential ~$4,000 car repair, looking for advice.","Hi Guys,

You all have been very helpful in the past so I am curious if anyone might have some advice for my current situation.

A year ago I bought a new Mustang with something like 50% down, and I have since paid down my 15K loan rather aggressively and I currently owe about 9K. A few days ago I brought the car to the dealer for a small transmission problem and Ford Motor Company voided the warranty on my transmission and has left me in a shitty position with the dealer wanting labor costs and me not having a working or usable car.

While I am currently working some avenues with arbitration and other things like that, I want to be prepared for this expense and make sure I'm using all my options correctly.

I have about 30K in available revolving credit at varying interest rates, the lowest being about 9.5%, with no balances on any of my cards. I also may be able to lean on some family members and get some small cash loans with little or no interest.

My questions are basically:

1. If I call my bank, do you think they will be able to increase my loan amount a bit so that I can get some of the cash I've paid into the loan back because I've paid it down so aggressively? (My credit score is mid 700's for the record).
2. Any other options I am missing? Trying to avoid interest here, even if its a few dollars.

Thanks guys :)",finance,1417364411
personalfinance,What is the best type of 2nd mortgage/home loan?,"My wife and I own a considerable portion of our house and because interest rates are still so low, we were thinking about taking out some kind of home equity line of credit to do a few things:
turn a big shed we have into a stand alone ""mother-in-law"" unit.
some other small home improvement projects.
pay down the last of our high interest debt.
invest a big chunk of it.

I did some looking into the different types of loans that we can take out and it looks like we can:
borrow one big chunk - cash that goes into our bank account.
or
take out a line of credit of which we can use as little or as much as we want.

We go back and forth on what might be the better option for us (for example, some of the lines of credit appear to have penalties if you don't use them/spend money) so I'd really love some guidance/advice from personal finance.

Are there any things that we should be specifically considering before taking out this loan?
What would be the ideal type of loan for us to take out?
What factors should we be considering in general for this loan?

thank you very much",finance,1417365371
personalfinance,PSA: Free Federal Tax Filing for Incomes Below $58k,"It's not too early to start thinking about filing taxes.  As a reminder, the IRS's **[Free File](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free)** program allows those with incomes under $58k to file their federal taxes for no charge in a partnership with the [Free File Alliance](http://freefilealliance.org/).  Many states also partner with the FFA to offer free state tax returns to those that qualify, and some states offer free e-filing for all taxpayers.

###What can you do in December to prepare for tax season?

* Finish up any IRA contributions for 2014 (you have until April 15, 2015 to make 2014 IRA contributions).

* See how your expected tax burden compares to your year to date withholding - with one month left to go, you can still probably increase or decrease your last paycheck's withholdings if you are under or over.  Use the [IRS Withholding Calculator](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator) or do a dummy return in Turbotax to see what your expected tax burden is going to be.

* If you have any capital losses or capital gains you are considering realizing, you have a month left to do it.

* Look up the schedules your various financial institutions are planning on issuing your documentation (1099s, etc) so you can watch for them.  Ask your employer when you will receive your W-2.

* If you are considering professional tax preparation and haven't done so before (or are switching preparers), now is the time to start asking around to find a tax preparer.  If you have an established relationship, it's always nice to reach out to say you will/will not be going with the same person again.

* I'm sure you'll have ideas as well, leave them in the comments.

personalfinance,"127k Student Loan, Mortgage, MBA, HELP!!!","As the title says, I have a few questions regarding my personal finances. Long story short, I'm a 23year old engineer in making 93k salary with an 8% bonus, so let's call it 100k. I have about $127,000 total student loan debt (I've already paid about 14k to principle when my loans were &gt;141k, and my current monthly payment is ~$1250), 100k in private loans (averaging about 8% interest) and 27k in federal loans (ranging from 3.4-6.8%). For assets, I own two vehicles about $29000 and have about 12k in 401k.

As I stated, I'm about to start my MBA which will cost me out of pocket about 7500 and the company will pay the rest. During this time (about 18-24months to complete program) I will be in deferment on those loans and could potentially bank the 1250*24 months = $30k. As I'd like to stop renting and purchase a home, at the end of this 2 years should I take the 30k and put it down as a downpayment or apply it to highest interest rate student loans. Cost of living in my area is very cheap. $200k can buy you a brand new 1500sqft home.

I take home just over 4400 a month after taxes, with the only real expense of 800/mo for rent, and 500/mo for other misc stuff --&gt;assuming my loans are in deferment for MBA.

personalfinance,SIMPLE IRA and low income year - do anything?,"I have a fair amount of money in a Vanguard SIMPLE IRA (100% in VTIVX right now) from a former employer. I have even more (largely in individual stocks) in a standard, non-tax-advantaged investment account. I'm in my upper 20s.

I have returned to school for a couple years, so my income is unusually quite low for a couple years, but I expect it to be fairly high, tax wise, when I return to the workforce. What, if anything, should I do to take full advantage of 2 years in a very low tax bracket?

Two specific questions:
* Should I roll over the SIMPLE IRA into a Roth? Something else
* Is it worthwhile to liquidate assets in my retail brokerage account to contribute to a Roth? They nearly all have long term tax gains.

personalfinance,Paying Off Credit Card While Building Up Financial Reserves Again,"Currently, I only have about $600 in my bank accounts. I'm trying to build that up again while paying off my credit card.

My credit card is sitting at about a $3800 balance and has a 13% interest rate and should be dropping to about 11.5% in the coming months. I racked up the balance while trying to pay for school. I was doing badly, had already taken out a $10,000 loan which I'm also paying off, and didn't have the 2.0 GPA to take out another. I was working two jobs at the time as well to try to pay for school books and afford living on my own. I know it was a dumb idea financially to continue, but I was in ""I've got to finish this no matter what"" panic mode. My financial situation was lending to my poor grades as I struggled to pay for things and decided I needed to choose between working to make more money or studying so I could pass my classes.

I got a much better job after finally just leaving school with an associates and vowing to return for my bachelors when I was financially stable again. I was trying immediately after getting that job to pay it off as quickly as possible by making huge payments on it biweekly, but I was starting to notice my money dwindle away or that I was only saving about $50 a month and I was just sitting around at home because I was broke. I tried to gleam what I could from other threads but found that they didn't give me a clear answer or closure.

Anyways, my questions are as follows:

I make about $900 a paycheck now or about $1800 after taxes. I make roughly 34k a year before taxes and deductions and closer to 26k after taxes and deductions and including bonuses(my job has a lot of random bonuses). I may be getting a 3% bump in the coming year and am looking at a promotion in a few months after that. What is the best way to pay this off? Should I try to pay it off as quickly as possible, or should I make smaller payments and finish it off a little slower? Or should I just be doing something else entirely?

I currently have a 401k taking 7% of my paycheck each time. I know I've seen you guys suggest higher, but my job only matches 7%. Would I be better served by reducing or increasing that amount?

Finally, I know I got off easy in the large scheme of things with student loans and student debt, but should $10,000 in student loans and almost $4000 in credit card debt be manageable with how much I make?

For a lot of these, I feel I already know the answer, but I'm welcome to suggestions and could really just use the reinforcement or contradictions. I'm completely open-minded. I've honestly been freaking out a bit about it even though I've had people telling me that it's really not something I should be worrying about as much as I do since it'll be an easy hump to get over.",finance,1417373600

I never did get into the t.v. shows - well...

I loved them.. but only seen very very few episodes- At the time I was at an age where I did not have the rights to the tv remote that my dad hawked over every day.

But now that I am older - and can choose my own programming - I have been watching ""Voyager"" - One episode every day on my break at work. Once I am home- I log onto Star Trek Online and I play until I need to get 4 - 5 hours of sleep- and I rinse and repeat this every day.

So my question goes out to all of you who might have selected this post to entertain yourselves on your work break or in most cases - a toilet break... how many here are interested in playing the PC game Star Trek Online?

I am 33 yrs old and for the most part-  I am always the youngest in a group among my friends to play this game. The community if extremely helpful - and for the most part - broken down using real world career paths by real world people, from the number cruncher for the military to the computer programmer for a college or doctors and lawyers - for the most part - a mature and fine bunch of people.

I'd like to encourage all who clicked on this to go over and download Star Trek Online - its free to play - you don't need real money for the best stuff "" just time to grind it "" or .. since most of us here spend more each day on an energy drink and a fast food order than what it takes to play the game.. dropping a few dollars into a game that brings us real world actor voice overs and continuations of some very good stories- should not be an issue at all.

if you do play STO already- go ahead, leave a reply here giving us your @handle in the game.

I, myself- I play as Fire Star@karmaplasticity in that game- 
I run a completed and fully outfitted Federation fleet with teamspeak, websites, alliances, whatever - a complete head over heels fool for the game. So I hope some here decide to join me over in Star Trek Online.

As it is very tacky to promote those virtual places here- I urge you to find me in game if you do care to find out more my fleet name, team speak server info and web forum/name URL - again... Fire Star@karmaplasticity  is how you can find me- 

I hope to see a lot of you all take a took at Star Trek Online if you have not already- Should be fun for some of you old dogs who lived and breathed Star Trek growing up to come in and follow along the story paths; some old writers for the t.v. shows have been employed too - keep that in mind.",technology,1417378967

Beyond this, I have made some smaller investments into BTCjam, which apart from its earlier fees, has been nothing but a good experience for me. For those of you who don't know, BTCjam is another step to removing banks from the equation entirely. They act as a middle man to create opportunities for Peer to Peer lending of Bitcoin, offering an interest rate for the investors.

Background: Currently 25yo making 60k a year working as a carpenter, just sold my V8 utility vehicle for $12,500 after 3 years of having it due to increase petrol prices and mechanical issues that seemed to pop up. After paying rest of the loan i had and providing a roadworthy and savings i had it left me with 10k cash.

I also have a SO of 3 years and we're getting married Sept 2015 and want to have a bought a house by then, we currently have $25,000 in an account which we are adding into weekly for a deposit, and her parents are going to lend us $100,000 to diminish the amount we get from the bank and we would pay them back as if we borrowed (X from bank + loaned 100k from parents) 

I have found an ex-demo new car with 550km on the clock for sale for 30k which i could probably work down to 28 or even less, with all the features i need for the job (tow bar, canopy and roof racks) and because it is for work I can claim all expenses (including depreciation) back on tax, where i would get a high percentage back in my refund. The loan would be for the full amount and interest rate would be 7% for 5 years. Working out to be about 6k in interest total.

Getting the new car i could put the cash i have straight into our deposit account and continue added to that, the new car will have capped price servicing and a warranty for 5+ years and be in good reliable mechanical condition for quite a long time. There also the amount of tax i would get back on the car over the term since it's tax deductible.

The other option is to try and find a older used car for work for around 10k and from what Ive seen for what i need, it'll be about 15 years old with 250,000km on the clock. Benefit to that is there is no loan and no loss of cash through interest. There is the added risk of it needing parts in the near future or being a complete dud, costing who knows how much.
