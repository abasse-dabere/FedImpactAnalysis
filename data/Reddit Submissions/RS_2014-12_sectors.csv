personalfinance,Every Dollar Earned/Spent in First 4 Yrs of Military Service,"Hello Redditors! Check out my graphic here:

http://i.imgur.com/WHIKWAV.jpg

I'm a 27 year-old active duty U.S. Military Engineer. After taxes, my average annual salary over 4 years has been $56,800. Despite graduating with $61,000 in student loans, I was able to pay them off using a simple rule I imposed on myself, which I call the ""Rule of One-Third."" It's very straightforward: Put 33% of your income towards increasing your net worth every year.

In this Graphic, I plotted every after-tax, cash dollar I earned in the military on a stacked line chart. The colors correspond to four different spending categories. I also pointed out some of the various spikes/anomalies for anyone who is curious. Over all, I feel like I have been able to lead a very normal and satisfying life without having to sacrifice much to maintain my 33% rule. I gave details on my car and my apartment so you have an idea of what my living conditions are. I am interested in Reddit's thoughts/opinions. Now that I have my personal finance down I am interested in learning more about investing. In the mean time, here are my primary observations that I have made in my limited 4-yr professional experience:

OBSERVATION #1: ""Good credit"" is an artificial incentive that banks and lenders use to get you to increase your debts (and consequently pay banks more money in interest). The most peculiar thing happened to me when I started paying off large chunks of debt at a time: The banks lowered my credit score, lowered the credit limit on my credit cards, and raised my variable interest rate. Remember that banks exist to earn money from lending money. Whatever financial advice you get from a bank should be taken with a grain of salt. If you get screwed over, it's not the bank's fault. It's your fault for not understanding the game. Consider yourself warned.

OBSERVATION #2 - Superficial expenses add up. The new car, the nicer apartment with nicer kitchen appliances, the macbook. These are all much better-looking objects, but substantially more expensive for essentially the same function. People try to claim they can't lower their living expenses to accommodate their budget when they usually can. The first place to look is for superficial expenses.

OBSERVATION #3 – Although people use them interchangeably, there is a big difference between personal finance and investing. Personal finance is the art of understanding your spending habits and trying to put as much spending towards acquiring assets as possible. Investing is understanding what assets to acquire using the money you put forward from your good personal finance habits. To me – personal finance is objective and can be applied to every person. In addition to covering our own cost of living, we should all strive to put the most percentage of our income towards assets as we can (33% is my number). Conversely, investing is subjective. How you choose to invest is entirely your own personal decision based primarily on knowledge and risk tolerance.

OBSERVATION #4 – The most common problem most people have with putting the most towards assets is they simply misinterpret what an asset truly is. In my opinion, the car you own and the house you live in are not assets. The money you put in your savings account to protect you from unexpected expenses in the future is also not an asset because it's not earning sufficient interest. Therefore, people should be extremely careful to make sure they're keeping these expenses within 66% of their income (as shown on the chart, my avg cost of living accounts for 46% of my after-tax income).

OBSERVATION #5 – Like so many other applications, the best way to improve efficiency within personal finance is to take the human out of the loop. The most logical observation a person can make is to realize that people are incapable of logic. Your emotions, your psychology, the way you subjectively interpret data is your greatest enemy when it comes to the cold, hard, robotic, quantitative numbers. You’ve got to be like Spock. Never use your emotions to govern any purchase. Budget for every dollar long before you spend it to prevent your emotions from interfering when it is time to make the purchase. For example, I know that my next car will be between $10,000-$12,000. I have made the decision about this now. In 2-3 years when I buy my next car, I will simply not trust the last minute emotions that pop up and tell me I should be spending more or less. I will not rationalize any “good deal” or bang for my buck unless they meet a pre-determined series of criteria that I make up months, perhaps years in advance. Just like you schedule your day, schedule your spending. Nothing we spend money on should ever be a surprise. Have a line of accounting already saved up and ready for unexpected expenses. Everything else should already be in your schedule/budget. This doesn’t mean you can’t be spontaneous. Just like you can schedule a weekend off for holiday to do whatever you want, you can also schedule a certain amount of money to do spend however you want. I call it my entertainment fund. On average I allow myself to spend up to 20% of income without any accountability/discretion. Vacations, furniture, and hobbies. I deliberately give myself money to waste on whatever I want. This is money that will not improve my net worth and is essentially there to improve my quality of life and prevent me from making poor impulsive decisions in the future. The result? I look like a normal functioning, spontaneous consumer on the surface. Little do my compatriots know that I’m a zealous and efficient financial drone. Obviously, this takes a lot of discipline and a strong mindset of delayed gratification and future rewards. You simply have it or you don’t.",finance,1417400273

personalfinance,Retirement strategy for parents near retirement - [asset allocation &amp; investment options],"My parents are a few years away from retirement and have been approaching me with questions on investing. Here's there situation:

* Based on their savings and current spending they have more than enough saved. I assumed that their living expenses in retirement should equal around 4% of their net worth (similar to Mr. Mustache's 4% rule). They have around 40% more than they need with the 4% rule
* They have no debts &amp; own their house so the only real expense that could change is their healthcare costs. Everything else in their budget should grow at the rate of inflation.
* Almost all of their savings is in cash with a decent amount in fixed income assets (bonds). They have little to no market exposure as they were burned in the dot com crash and have become extremely conservative.

My main concerns are:

* I think they have become too conservative &amp; inflation may become a risk for them over the long term since their asset classes return so little.
* Ideally, I want a managed ""set it &amp; forget it"" type solution for them. When my parents actively manage their investments they tend to make foolish decisions since they don't really understand financial instruments &amp; react emotionally to changes. Previously they got burned in the dot com crash (they over invested in one asset class and then panicked). More recently, my dad got burned in a  foreign government bond that had a high interest rate even though I warned him about FX currency risk. 
* I want to insulate them from financial planners &amp; others who target retirees with bad investments (high commissions, fees,, etc.)

What should be my parents retirement strategy? Obviously, their goal is largely to protect their nest egg while outpacing inflation. What should their asset allocation look like and what solutions should I be exploring that can ""auto manage"" their money at a low fee? I was considering suggesting Wealthfront or a Vanguard target fund as a potential solution.",finance,1417403488
technology,Let's bypass the FCC. Here's our local government game plan,"I've posted this several times, and I'm going to keep trying. People need to stop taking a sit back and let the FCC fix it approach. We need to bypass the FCC and make change on a local level.

We tried to make change with demonstrations, but change did not come. We live in an age of technology, and technology brings instant gratification to our young minds. The more effort a project requires, the less people will participate. When a project takes a substantial amount of time to make change, people will most likely lose interest.

If we want to undertake a project to create change, we must focus a few things:

* Making it easy to get involved and stay involved.
* Creating a self-sustainable platform.
*  Keeping the costs low.

I've had multiple ideas since RestoreTheFourth to stay politically involved, one of which being Municipal Fiber (working title).

The concept of the idea is to have an interactive website that will allow individuals to lobby all levels of government and begin the roll out of municipality owned fiber. There are several features that need to be implemented to help us with the three goals I outlined above.

* An interactive map that allows individuals to find representatives at a city, county, state, and federal level. The map will also allow people to see and understand laws regarding municipal fiber in their area.

* A platform to digitally show support for our endeavors (rolling out municipal fiber across the United States). We can facilitate the creation of petitions, email representatives, and in the future mail physical letters on behalf of the people.

* A complete guide showing how to and the benefits of rolling out municipal fiber. From petitioning and lobbying local government to a guide for the local elected representatives to put a plan into action. We need to be able to clearly show the benefits, the costs, the necessity, and the plan of action. Many communities (http://www.muninetworks.org/communitymap) have accomplished a municipal network, so let's collaborate and share a list of best practices.

You can see a concept of the website here: http://kobolsolutions.com/municipalfiber/

In order to put this plan in to action, I need talented individuals willing to collaborate and get things accomplished.

* Research Hounds
* Writers
* Individuals experienced in local/state politics

personalfinance,Question for medical student (US) who screwed up the management of his finances and needs extra funding,"Hi,

I am a medical student who screwed up the management of his finances.

Long story short, I miscalculated when in the year I would be charged for health insurance and I now owe approximately $2000 to my schools bursers office that was supposed to come out of my personal expenses for this semester. I do not have 2000, nor do I have an emergency fund at this point in time.

Normally, I would have bitten the bullet and payed it off with sweat equity (I previously ran into some money trouble prior to grad school, so picked up a parttime job bussing tables, sucked it up, and payed off my debts). 

However, medical school is unique in that I am required to sign a technical standards agreement stating that I will explicitly NOT work during the school year. I am currently in talks to try and see what work study jobs, if any, I qualify for, but this is in no way a guarantee

Ironically (or coincidentally), I budgeted for this expense. In the spring loan disbursement. Which, from my understanding, I currently don't have access to until I pay off the current hold on my account.

So essentially, I need a way to get 2000 USD, that I can pay off (gaurnteed) in approximately 6 weeks. I am looking into personal loan options, but given my low 600 credit score and lack of significant collateral, and the fact that I just had to establish a 1000 USD line of credit for an emergency healthcare procedure, all I could feasibly see myself getting is an unsecured personal loan with what I am sure is a ridiculous interest rate, if I even qualify for that (which I understand I may not).

I have learned a lot from this experience, unfortunately, so if there is any other grad students who would like to learn how not to fuck up this badly, I am glad to tell you.

To the rest of you, if there is an avenue for funding I am not considering I will gladly hear it. My only other option is to take a leave of absence for a year, work to earn that money, and come back next January with the money in tow and some actual financial sense. This could destroy any chance I have at getting a competitive residency , but if thats what it takes I fully accept it.

My mom has excellent credit, but we were told there is a special section on the FICO for auto loans. Since she had never bought a car in her name, and never had an autoloan, she had no history, and that is why the high interest rate was produced.

personalfinance,Totally overwhelmed by student loan repayment options...,"I’m coming to you all desperate for advice as I literally have no idea what to do or where to begin. I’ve exhausted my circle of adults, and none have a clue about anything like this. 

I graduated in May of 2013 and was hired as a full time graphic designer in January of 2014. I earn 40,000 a year plus a little here and there for free-lance work I do on the side. The problem is I’m paying a small mortgage’s worth in student loans each month. 

To be precise – I earn 1,235.03 bi-weekly. New Jersey Class gets 343.00 per month. My federal Stafford loans combined get $291.31, and my parent plus loans (not even in my name) through Sallie Mae / Navient get $606.94. Cell-phone and car insurance combined is $200 a month. So each month I’m netting 1029.12 after these basic expenses. My other expenses include gas (20 mile commute), food, car maintenance (I drive an old 2002 buick) and a girlfriend. I’m living at home so I’m not paying rent right now. 

**My question is- what should I do? If anything at all?** I feel like most people don’t pay $1200 a month in student loans… I’ll provide the specific details of each loan in case that will help any advice. 

&gt;**NJ Class:**

&gt;I’m fairly certain these are 10 year although I can’t find it for sure anywhere on the online portal. There are two of them, one with an outstanding principal of 21,880.59 at 7.92% interest, the other with a 12,902.03 principal at 7.59%.  Total outstanding balance: 35,289.43

&gt;**Federal Stafford subsidized / unsubsidized**

&gt;There are 8 of these, one subsidized and one unsubsidized for each year I was at school. Their interest ranges from 3% to 7%, all fixed rate. Their balances range from 2,000 to 5,000. The total outstanding balance: $25,274.23

&gt;**Parent Plus loans**

&gt;These are where I’m really fucked. Halfway through school my parents credit plummeted and we no longer were eligible for NJ class loans. These parent plus loans were the only option for me to continue my degree. The problem is they’re not in my name- they’re in my stepdad’s. I feel like this creates some issues. One has a balance of 26,083.30 at 7.65% interest, the other $22,555.93 at 7.65%. Total 48,639.23. These are 10 year as well. 

So here’s where I’m torn. 


**Should I consolidate?**

Paying $1200 a month definitely sucks being 23, but is this the best bet? It’s not inconvenient to pay all the separate loans- the parent + and federal loans are set up to automatically debit. 


**Can I do [Income-Based repayment?](http://www.ibrinfo.org/) Should I?**

From the overwhelming amount of confusing information on the internet, what I’ve gathered is this: I can consolidate my federal and NJ class loans and pay them to the amount of 10 percent of my income each month. *PLEASE correct this statement if it is wrong.* Assuming that statement is true, this would seemingly lower my total monthly payments to about 840 – 870 (The parent plus payments would remain the same). That gives me a little breathing room, but will I end up paying more in the end? Another thing to consider is – I work for a stable non-profit organization that’s been around for over 10 years. Again, correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe if I remain at this job for 10 years and make all consecutive payments, my balance is forgiven. I haven't even planned what I'm having for dinner tonight, so there's no way I can predict if I'll still be working here in 10 years, but something to consider. 


**Should I go the route of private consolidation?**

Wells-Fargo has been sending me mail trying to grab my loans. I spoke to someone on the phone briefly and I didn’t have all of the details I’m giving you now, but the guy said they could likely get my monthly payments down to $600 dollars. I may be 23 but I’m not stupid… that just sounds too good to be true. What are the pros and cons of getting them consolidated by a bank? Would the bank be able to buy up the parent plus loans and consolidate even though they’re not in my name?

**Which do I attack first?**

Let’s say I don’t consolidate and want to start over-paying my monthly payments… In what order should I attack these loans? Which is the most important to abolish first, second, last?

I really appreciate any advice you guys can give me.. and I’m sorry for the super long post. I really have nowhere else to turn and I feel like every month I don’t take action I’m just hurting myself. It’s an unfortunate position to be in but I’m grateful to have my degree and a stable job when I see my friends working at a gym or a movie theatre…I already know my 20s will suck but I could be worse off.

personalfinance,Missed one arranged car payment now they are trying to repo my car =\ (Canada),"1st of all, I do not think I am in the right nor am I looking for a loophole, I'm simply looking at options available to me.

Backstory - bought a 2011 Mercedes c300 in 2013. Got a fairly good deal on the car itself at the time, but negative equity and a 9% interest rate inflated my monthly payment quite a bit ($750/month) Now, I know it may seem like a lot, but I'm in sales and typical months income is anywhere from $5000-$10000 after tax so $750 did not seem like such a burden.

Fast forward to earlier this year, I had a horrible back injury and was off work for 6 months (June-Nov). During this time I was getting EI (employment insurance) from the Ontario government. I was receiving $900 bi-weekly which was not covering all the bills at the time. Long story short, I fell ~$2000 in arrears with my finance company. I set up a payment plan with them where I was to pay what was in arrears, and the remainder would get attached to the end of the term which was great. I made every payment on time except for one which was 4 days late (including a weekend). That was ~Oct 14th and the EI I was receiving was cut off 2 weeks early unexpectedly.

I have not made a payment since than, except for $350 I paid last friday when I got my 1st cheque from my new company now that I am back to work. The problem is, because one payment was 3 days late, they now say I owe the full arrears (~$4000+bailiff fee's) payable in the next 72 hours. This is not realistic, and I will not be asking anyone for that sum of money. They have been attempting to repo the car for 2 months so they claim, but I do not reside at the address thats listed on the account. Therefore, I still have my car.

Now, I have all intentions of fixing this. I spoke with the finance company and now that a bailiff has been assigned, there is nothing I can do with them other than pay the full arrears immediately which is not possible.

What are my options when it comes to a repo company? I don't plan on handing the car over unless it becomes my only option as I use this as my primary mode of transportation. Again, I want to fix this I dont want to lose the car but obviously I am not in the best financial shape due to my injury and loss of wages.

personalfinance,Student loan guarantor holding up federal clearance,"Hey everyone,

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes.

I'm pursuing a position at a federal prison, and in order to pass the clearances necessary to work there, I need to begin to pay, or show that I am willing to pay, my outstanding debts. I have two outstanding medical bills in collections; however, they have been more than willing to get me started, and provide proof of me starting, to pay them back.

Where I've run into problems is, I have a student loan (with only ~$1,500 remaining) that went into default (rough year, long story). In order to get into what they're calling Default Rehabilitation, they asked me to send them my 1040 from last year with my adjusted gross income, so that they could calculate a plan to pay back the debt. Frankly once I get the position I'm pursuing, I'll be able to pay the entire loan off in one to two months.

However, I sent them the information they asked for. The first agent I spoke to said that they would be willing to send me e-mail confirmation that they had received my information, and that I was moving into Default Rehabilitation. Now, a week later, I have called them and asked why I haven't received anything. This new agent tells me that they would never e-mail anything, and that I have to wait an additional 5-7 business days to get any sort of confirmation that they've even received it. They also told me that they've begun wage garnishment, which wasn't mentioned when I called the week before.
I feel like I'm getting the run-around here, and that they're going to hold up the process so long that I don't get the job, and they'll instead just garnish my wages from whatever other position I can get afterwards.

Is there anything I can do?",finance,1417468369
personalfinance,Thinking about refinancing our house to help pay a few other things. Thoughts?,"We currently have an FHA mortgage for about $118k (original amount was around $125k) with an interest rate of 3.75% fixed. We've been in our house for 2.5 years. My husband and his dad had talked about refinancing our house to help pay off a few of our (my) bills and get some extra cash for a new car. I don't know the first thing about mortgages or refinancing, and all I've been able to find on Google are different mortgage calculators. Here is where we're at with my student loans:

ACS: $663.70  1.75% (next payment due in May 2016)

Wells Fargo: $6,424.15  6.75%

SLFC: $13,055 4.75%

Navient/Sallie Mae: $12,436 9.75%


We currently have no other debt apart from the $300 left to pay off our phones (interest free if paid by September, we've been doing about $100 a month). We ditched cable a long time ago, and our phone bill is $70/mo, there isn't much else for us to cut out. We only have about $600 in savings, so that isn't going to go far with anything. 

We also currently have two very small sedans, both over 10 years old. Our second child is due in about 6 months, and one of our vehicles possibly won't make it that long. We're looking to upgrade to a small SUV that will hopefully last us a long time. 

Anyway, back to the refinancing. My husband believes our house should appraise for about $149k based on papers we've gotten from the county. He and his father discussed refinancing to get maybe $10-20k in hand to purchase a 'new' vehicle and to pay off part or all of one of my student loans. They think since the interest rates for the house is lower, it would make more sense to add it to the house loan instead of continuing to pay a ridiculous high rate to keep it a student loan. My major concern is that our house had been on the market for more than a year when we bought it, and had been reduced in price from $180k down to $129k when we bought it. I don't want to add $20k to our loan and sell the house in a couple years and lose $40k on it. At the same time, cutting out one of those monthly payments and having a newer car that I can drive without worrying about it breaking down would be very nice. 

Also, our current loan is through Wells Fargo. If we go ahead with this, we both think it would be best if we go elsewhere for the loan, but I honestly don't know of other companies that are more reputable for mortgages. If there is any other information I can provide, please ask. I'm not really sure what's relevant. And if I could get ELI5 answers, that would help me understand a little more!

personalfinance,"College sophomore needing advice, please.","So I'm a 19-year-old sophomore in a top land-grant/state university and I've just now realized I need to start keeping more track and taking more care of my personal finances. First let me tell you a bit about my situation and then I'll get to the questions.

I work at my university and make ~$15/hr at a desk job, have ~$4k saved, pay ~$600/mo to live (includes rent, utilities, food), estimated $18k for cost of attendance and got $6500 in scholarships/grants for the 2014-2015 academic year with the rest ($7500) in federal loans.

I've paid for all cost of living in the 2014 calendar year by myself, all bills are in my name, and I live hundreds of miles away from my mom. She's filled out my last two FASFAs, so I can't tell you what she put on them because I don't even know. My bank account is kinda combined with my mom's as I got it when I was 17 so she had to be the manager or guardian or whatever of the account before they would issue me a debit card.

---

What I'm wondering is should I file my upcoming taxes as an independent? She filed my taxes last year and said I only got $20 or so in returns, but I feel like I got more because I saw ~$5000 direct deposited into her bank account (I have access to the account online) and the IRS return calculator said I was $300 in overpayments (money to be returned). She's also ""borrowed"" $250 from me here and there while forgetting to pay it back and I haven't brought it up too much because I can see she's already struggling to get by on her normal paycheck. She constantly brings up her ""terrible credit"" that my father supposedly ruined when I try to talk to her about whether I should get a credit card or not. He's incarcerated for grand theft auto, armed robbery, and a bunch of other stuff for a long while (doesn't matter there, never cared for him or had a relationship with him). She provides my health insurance, so I don't know if that means I can't file as an independent or not.

Also, should I - in my current situation - get the Discover It student card? I'd only use it for bills and when I have the money to pay the monthly balance off, so I don't know if it would help or hurt me. My bank issues ""rewards checking"" that supposedly makes my debit card a line of instant credit that improves my credit rating and gives me some really shitty rewards. I do get my monthly credit report for free, so I guess that's alright.

Should I split my bank account away from my mom's so that she no longer has access to it? I don't really know what else I'd lose or gain by doing so besides privacy and peace of mind that my mom isn't snooping in my past charges, credit history, or possibly ""borrowing"" my money.

Finally, what should I do about student aide or searching for scholarships? I'm a white male with nothing wrong with me and no special memberships to any clubs so I already lose out on a good handful of scholarships, my mom's credit is too bad for a parent loan, and I'm the first in my entire family to ever go to college. I've done a lot of Googling and even looked on NerdWallet/NerdScholar and I can't find a scholarship that I'm eligible for. I've got above a 2.8 GPA and all the scholarships my college provides requires above a 3.0 GPA, so I'm just barely not eligible.

Any and all help is extremely appreciated. Thanks PF.",finance,1417472171

personalfinance,Paying off student loans vs. investing?,"I am lucky to have landed a great job out of college. Here is what my financial situation will look like in 6 months when I start working:

Student loans: $26,000 @ 5.61% weighted average interest rate, 10 year term

Net monthly cash: $2350

Net cash is after all expenses (e.g., maxing retirement contributions, living expenses, housing, savings, etc.).

I have 3 options:

1. Pay off student loans ASAP with all $2,350 left over each month
2. Make minimum payments of ~$260 each month and invest the rest in index funds (~net return of 7%)
3. Combination of the two

I was planning on simply paying off my loans as fast as possible, but, considering the interest rate is lower than the average return of the market, I feel that it would be better to make the minimum payment and invest the rest to earn a higher return on my money. I'd like to buy property in a few years and the roughly $2,100 I'd be putting into an investment account would be really beneficial. Am I missing anything here?

EDIT: Looking at the wiki was helpful, however that only mentions that you benefit more if the interest rate is &lt;4%. My rate is still below the average market return of 7%, so should I still focus on investing more than student loans?",finance,1417476086

&gt; We explore the implications of asset price volatility for the management of monetary policy. We show that it is desirable for central banks to focus on underlying inflationary pressures. Asset prices become relevant only to the extent they may signal potential inflationary or deflationary forces. Rules that directly target asset prices appear to have undesirable side effects. We base our conclusions on (i) simulation of different policy rules in a small scale macro model and (ii) a comparative analysis of recent U.S. and Japanese monetary policy.

personalfinance,Should I use retirement fund to buy a home?,"Here is the very basic rundown: 
I am 34, work overseas and earn 35kish a year with few bills to pay. I have about 12k in student loan debt at a low interest rate that I pay off about 200$/month on, and no other debt. I have great credit, but have what banks and mortgage providers view as no acceptable employment history (I've worked mostly for Chinese companies on a contractor basis). 
Between my wife and I, we have about 80k saved. I also have a TIAA-Cref retirement account that I contributed around 4k to about 7-8 years ago, which is now worth about 18k.
If I return to the US, I would like to buy a home (I have no definite plans to do so now, but it's likely within the next 3 years.) I know that in Kansas, near my hometown, I could get an older 3 bedroom house for 30-60k, and a nicer 3-4 bedroom for 80-100k no problem. 

My question is this: I can legally withdraw from the TIAA-Cref account without penalty to pay for the purchase of my first home. Since I can no longer contribute to it (I could roll it over to a 401-k or another fund with my bank, USAA, but haven't had time or energy to jump through all of the hoops, which include contacting my former employer for a letter and filling a bunch of paperwork for both banks).
That money, plus the money from savings, would mean I could cut out the bank and wouldn't need a mortgage at all. I would own the home at closing, debt free. 
My thinking is that by using the money from my retirement account, which is non-liquid in most other cases, I can keep some money in my savings account. And owning a home seems like at least as good of an investment as a retirement account that I can't add to. 

So, any advice or observations?",finance,1417488552
personalfinance,Need help making a plan to pay off debt and rebuild my credit!,"Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to respond to this! 

Long story short, I got really sick while I was in college, withdrew from school for a semester, and racked up medical and credit card bills that I couldn't pay off. My health failed again which prevented me from working full time for a year and I barely made ends meet. I now make $41,000 a year (about $2,500 a month after taxes) and pay $550 a month in rent/utilities. I ignored my financial problems when I was sick, and now I need to take responsibility.

* Macy's : $332 - Charged Off

* Bank Credit Card: $2,452 - Charged Off

* Federal Student Loan: $9,000 - In Collection

* Federal Student Loans: $46,000 - Current

I'm not sure how the ""charged off"" notation works. Do I pay them, do I not? If I do, is it reflected on my credit report? AmEx is offering to accept around $480 in a letter that they sent, should I pay that or the full amount? 

All of my student loans were transferred to a loan servicer except for the $9,000 in collection. I didn't realize that they all hadn't been transferred, and therefore wasn't paying on the $9,000. My fault 100%. I think there is a way to combine them all, but I am not sure how that works if this loan is now in collections.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin encourages actual saving, something most of the population desperately needs. For the first time, I'm actually enjoying saving my money.","For the first time in my life,  I'm excited about saving.   
  
I bought another two bitcoins today:   It felt good.   I've never felt that way about transferring money to a savings account or buying shares of a stock.   Why?   
  
Putting money in a savings account has always felt wrong to me,  even before I understood the stupidity of the math behind it.   Those dollars are earning the interest equivalent of being inside a mattress,  and are getting weaker each year through inflation.   And if/when hyper inflation shows up,  forget about your pathetic savings accounts.   
  
Real estate is out.   I'm still laughing about my ex getting the house in the divorce,  only to have her get wallet raped when they immediately tripled her property taxes (nearly doubling the mortgage).   

The stock market or funds then seems the only logical choice for someone who wants to save.   But you know what's **not** exciting?   Buying stocks at all time market highs.   Even if it turns out to be the mathematically correct decision down the line,  the threat of losing your investment or the worry of the ticker destroys any feel good feelings you have.  Buy and hold (for forty years)  is dead.  If you don't believe me,  invest in the railroads,  like daddy always did.  And we're not even addressing concerns about the underlying currency the market is built off of.   
  
After all of my financial study,  until bitcoin, I determined  the only reasonably viable 'fire-and-forget' way to save funds in our modern world was technology ETFs.  That's a pretty good way to save money,  but bitcoin is even better.   
  
We have already reached the tipping point.   In a matter where faith is the principal behind which value rises,  faith in bitcoin has surpassed the critical amount needed for superadoption.  Now we just need time.   
  
When I buy a piece of bitcoin,  I feel like I'm buying land or a hot dot com domain in the nineties.   Something precious that they're not making more of.   Bitcoin is that and more,  because it could reasonably scale to the space age and beyond.   Dollars,  gold,  and land won't do that.   
  
In 200 years,  when you need to send money to Mars colony,  what will you do?   Send bitcoin.   It's a reasonable future,  and it's the only currency we have that has that promise and potential.  
  
When space mining ramps up,  all precious metals will rapidly become worthless.   The 6000 year old bubble will come crashing down.   When the next plot to save the value of fiat comes about (because they will inevitably need to raise interest rates or face QE infinity)  then there is a good chance that people will look to put their assets in something that can't be created out of thin air.   We already know what that something is.   
  
The blockchain 🔗 is here to stay,  and will be used to store information for thousands of years.   It can't be expanded,  no matter how far consciousness or the economy expands.   It is limited to 21 million bitcoins,  which then can be broken down to individual satoshis,  but that's it.   **If you own a bitcoin,  you own a piece of the future.**  
  
To the paid trolls who will invade my topic,  go right ahead.   I just hope you take some of what your masters are paying you and buy some bitcoins with it.   Because deep down,  we both know the truth.   
 
And for the trolls that aren't being paid,  I truly feel sorry for you.   Because you are the ones who are dedicating your life to proving the world is flat,  and crying for those who claim otherwise to be burnt at the stake.  And the world will eventually eat your dust,  and life will go on without your resistance to change.   Because that's how the universe works.   
  
I was already one of 21 million by owning a whole coin (the concept of which will seem ridiculous in fifty years...  An average person controlling an **entire** bitcoin?  You could only wish!).   The next step?   Becoming one of 2.1 million,  by hitting ten coins.  
  
I'm saving my money.   And it feels good.  I wish the same feeling to everyone else.

personalfinance,Student Loans: Is IBR or Deferment the best choice for me?,"I have about 62,000 in student loan debt and my post-grad deferment is ending this month. My loan payment under the Standard Repayment option is going to be $685 per month. In the past six months, I've been paying down the last of my credit card debt (about $1500 to go). I also have about $7000 in private student loans that I want to knock out next. With a $700 federal loan payment, I will only have about $300-$500 to put on the private loans (that's being generous). I also need to put aside some money for a bigger emergency fund/saving account. 

Should I do IBR for the next 6 months to a year and pay extra on the highest interest loans when I can? Or should I try for a deferment and use the six months to really chip away at the rest of my credit card and private loan debt? If I go the IBR route, what happens to the interest that has accrued if I switch to a different repayment option?

personalfinance,Should I cash in my inexpensive whole life policy?,"To continue today's life insurance theme, I have been wanting to ask opinions on my policy.

**Background**:

In 1986 when I was a toddler, my dad set me up with a whole life type policy. I knew about this, but for ~25 years it was his thing. He paid the premiums. Once I got married I decided it would be a good idea to take control of that and change the beneficiary to my husband. Since then (about a year) I've been paying the premiums. My dad did it just as a nice thing and he doesn't care if I cash it out, so yay no potential tension there.

**Policy Details**:

* Insurance &amp; Death benefit amount: $15,000
* Premium: $14/quarter (or $4.67 a month). Has been this cost since 1986 and will stay this cost until maturity.
* Maturity date: June 24, 2085 (so, 100 years from start date)
* Interest rate: currently 4.5%; original documentation states ""7.4% or less"" so presumably it has a variable rate
* Cash &amp; surrender value: $1767
* Taxable gain upon surrender: $198
* No surrender fees
* The policy is with Thrivent. They have local chapters, and every quarter or two my local chapter hooks us up with free movie tickets to the second run ($3) theater. So, fringe benefit, I guess.

**Life Details**:

I am currently unemployed (but looking), thus my husband does not depend on my income. I haven't done anything with this policy because it isn't very expensive, and my thought was at least it's funeral money if I die. We don't have a full emergency fund (yet) or any other way to pay for funeral costs. I am only 30, though. If I cash it out I'd either use it to beef up the emergency fund or put it in my IRA.

**Question**:

Would you recommend keeping it or cashing it out?",finance,1417544696

personalfinance,I'm a recent graduate with more money than I know what to do with. I need some financial advice!,"So I am not too sharp financially, but I know I do not need as much money as I currently have (to live at this moment in my life). My job pretty much pays for all of my expenses. I really want to responsible with my funds in order to make them last into the future. Looking for advice on investing, or what would be the smartest move in general. 

Current funds:

Morgan Stanley:
+$45,000 

This amount is in a Morgan Stanley account my grandmother set up for me. I know this money has some kind of interest accruing. I don't really know how it works but it usually goes up or down a bit each year. 

Student loans:
Total debt: -$36,000

The highest interest rate is at 6.8%, which is about $22,000 of the total loans. I'm looking to pay off this specific loan immediately.

Other: 
+$25,000

I won a lawsuit before I was even old enough to understand what a lawsuit is. This January I will be receiving an additional $25,000.

I know I at LEAST want to pay off my high interest loans, maybe all of them, but part of me wants to pay off the rest on my own (I'm stubborn I suppose). 

I also am not sure what to do with the additional $25,000 I will be receiving this year. I'm sure I can give it to Morgan Stanley and have them invest it, but I just don't know if that's the best move.

personalfinance,I just got a huge bonus and I am not sure what to do with it - Wife and I disagree,"I just got 25,000 dollars as part of a bonus this year, which is huge and completely unusual. I have another end of year bonus coming as well and I have 2500 saved that was supposed to go to taxes.

I am technically self-employed so I pay quarterly taxes.

My priorities in my head currently are to :

1. Pay off the taxes I owe to the feds and state, I owe some back taxes from underpaying this year.

2. Pay off the taxes I owe as part of an installment agreement from last year.

3. Pay off any remaining debt, which is about 7000 dollars on credit cards and 2000 dollars in medical bills.

My wife and I had a huge fight about this. She insists we should go to a financial planner and get a recommendation, and she even is saying we should pay off medical and credit card debt first so we can improve our credit, then keep the rest until we file a return.

I don't like this plan. The feds are probably the worst group of people to owe money to because they can utilize the law more effectively to seize assets or garnish wages. We will owe the feds *no matter what* so why not just pay the estimated tax? Maybe we'll get some back in our return.

I also want to be sure how much of the money we can actually spend on settling other debts, and what might be left over for savings and maybe a bit of a Christmas treat (like IDK just one item we've been meaning to get). Another factor is we are terrible about dipping into savings when our budgets run over. I just want to pay off the Feds fast so we don't end up owing them money we don't have.

What would a financial planner say differently about all this? Im hesitant to pay out 150-300 dollars just to have them tell me I should do exactly what I planned on doing anyway. I mean, how could a financial planner tell me to prioritize non-tax debt over tax debt?

Thanks for any advice.

EDIT :

As a side note, I also have student loans. Lots of them. However I am prioritizing the higher interest debts at the moment.

EDIT 2 : 

We ended up actually sitting down and going through the numbers. We can pay off all our tax and credit card debt, and there's even enough left over for some car repairs (we own the cars outright, they are older vehicles) and a bit for savings! As part of the compromise I agreed to go to a financial planner in a few months to get a long term plan in place to get a house. Thanks everyone!",finance,1417547998

personalfinance,"How to pay off two student loans. Start with one, or pay them off evenly?","Hello,

I graduated college about two years ago with only $7,500 worth of debt. I was not the smartest after I graduated and realized that even though I had a low monthly payment, I should have been spending much more on it. Either way, I'm getting to it now.

My question is if there is a benefit for paying the smaller one off first. The smaller one started at $2,500 with 3.4% interest, and the other was at $5,000 with 6.8% interest. My first reaction would be to say they can be paid evenly since the interest is pretty much the same, but I've had people tell me otherwise. What's the best course of action in this situation?

Bitcoin,Just got privacy raped by Chase thanks to VERY invasive KYC/AML. Bitcoin can't obliterate this system soon enough,"I had no idea KYC/AML had gotten so invasive, because it *definitely* wasn't like this a few years ago when I signed up for a checking account.

*The Story*

I've had a checking account with Chase bank for a few years now, which I used *very* infrequently (once or twice a year just to cash a check or do other miscellaneous banking things). I do have a credit card with them that I use heavily, but always keep paid off.

My credit score was high 700's last time I checked (2010). Since then I've bought a house and am financially stable (money in savings, 401k + IRA + investments, etc). I have no criminal record and a background of military service, so basically an ideal client.

Yesterday I went to cash a paper check from a friend and was told my account had been closed due to inactivity. No big deal I said, lets get it re-opened. I then proceeded to sit through the most invasive set of highly personal questions since joining the military, *all to re-open a checking account I'd already opened*.

Here are as many of the questions as I can remember:

 - Do you have any other bank accounts? With who? How many types of accounts do you have with them? (savings, checking, retirement, etc)

 - Do you use direct deposit with those other banks? Do you have a debit card with them? 

 - What is your annual income? Where does it come from? What other sources of income do you have?

 - How much did you pay for your home? What's your interest rate? How much do you owe on your mortgage?

 - How much money do you expect to be moving through this account each month? In cash? In check?

 - Do you wire money in the US? Outside the US? Do you plan to?

All this to have a simple checking account. I don't know whether it's Chase being hyper invasive or just new KYC/AML policies, but I left feeling angry that I had to provide all this extremely personal information simply to have a checking account. And I'm an ideal, fiscally responsible client! How much worse would it be for people barely getting by, or with a criminal record?

personalfinance,Pay off car loan vs saving for down payment,"I have searched PF and seen numerous posts on this topic, but most are a year or two old and don't exactly describe my situation, so I wanted to get some second opinions from you guys.

Background: 

* I have about $200K in stocks that have been slowly maturing since the I inherited it back in 2004. 
* I have a car loan that has ~$20,800 left. 
* My wife and I are trying to buy a home by next summer (for numerous personal reasons, but one is before interest rates are expected to be raised by the Fed) and have saved ~13.5K in the last 5 months. 
* Our combined take-home pay (after taxes) is ~9800/month. 
* We live in a high-cost-of-living area and are able to squirrel away only ~2500/month, in an interest bearing account of 0.9% APR.
* The APR on the loan is 1.79%, and has 3 more years left.
* We have no credit card debt (other than the normal pay-everything-off-at-the-end-of-the-month)
* I have another 100K in 401k/IRAs.
* We don't have much of an emergency fund.

I know we're not going to get enough by saving alone to get 20% on a house, and I'm willing to liquidate some of that stock to cover the difference in our savings. If I paid off the remainder of the car loan with our savings and ~7K of stock, I can then use those would-be car payments to help replenish the savings account. I did the math and paying off the car now would save me ~$593 in interest, a little more than one month's car payment.

Or should I keep paying the note and save as usual, using whatever money is necessary from stocks to cover the difference needed.

I guess the 7K I take from stocks would be replenished by my additional savings contributions by the time we buy the house. But is it wrong to think that it's better to keep as much money in stocks as possible? With the car note being so low, I don't see too much advantage to paying it off, and it's not a real financial burden each month that I would have a significant psychological boost from not having it.

personalfinance,please help with my complicated tax/loan/employment situation (serious),"Hi Reddit! This is a throwaway account because I'm pretty embarrassed about the details of my situation, and I hope you can help me figure out how to proceed from here in the most financially responsible way possible.

This is going to get a little complicated, so please bear with me. I'll list the facts of my situation separately, and then ask my questions.

1. I'm male, mid-30's, been married for a few years, no previous marriages/alimony/anything like that. No children but we hope to have some soon (in the next year or so, ideally). No real savings, no real property. (I own a cheap car outright and all the stuff in our apartment, but no real estate or anything). College degree but that's it. No credit, I expect (I haven't checked it in years). I owe about 30k in personal loans to friends and family but they're all relatively affluent and don't mind waiting to be paid back when I can. And yes, I make frequent payments on these loans.

2. I went through a period in my twenties where I didn't really plan for the future at all because I was pretty seriously depressed and just making it through a day felt like a win back then. I know that's no excuse, but it sets up a lot of the following info, so I thought it would be a good idea to mention it.

3. I dropped out of grad school during my depression years, probably 10 years ago or so. Paid my student loans for a while (like a year, maybe?) and then stopped when money got tight and when I stopped caring about much of anything. I have no idea what the outstanding balance is on them, or to whom I even owe the money--whether it's the government or a collection agency, or what. The loans were federal loans, not private. I took them out around 2004 or so, for 2 years of school. The original balance on them was probably around 20k but I really don't remember. Because I'm self-employed, whoever I owe the money to seems to have given up on finding me, since they don't have wages to garnish or anything. I'm sure the situation will eventually come to a head if I let it keep going. More on this in the question below.

4. I also had IRS problems for a while (see, I told you this was embarrassing.....). A few years ago the IRS levied my bank account and I was forced to deal with the situation. I'm currently on an installment payment plan to pay back taxes to the IRS, and it costs me around $500/month. I believe I have a little less than $100k to pay them still. My back-tax-negotiation-guy tells me that in a year or so the IRS will likely re-assess my income (and/or my spouse's income) and determine another payment plan. Apparently that's the standard procedure.

5. My income varies widely from month to month. Some months it's 2k, some months it's 10k. (All income numbers in these lists are pre-tax.) Most months, lately, it's around 5k. I'm up-to-date on taxes this year for the first time since I've been self-employed, paying them regularly through the IRS's online system.

6. My spouse's income also varies, but is a little more stable. It's usually around 7k/month. She has student loans that she's always paid on time, and she's up-to-date on her taxes.

7. My problems with the IRS happened before we got married, and my repayment plan is based only on my income, not on our joint income. We filed jointly for the first time this April (2013 taxes). My student loans were also incurred several years before I was married.

8. I'm going to be part-owner of a new company in the next few months. I'm forming it with a few business partners as a spin-off from a parent company they own. When that company is formed, my portion will be owned by my one-man LLC.

9. My business partners want to pay me for the advance work I've been doing for our new company while we wait to spin it off. They want to pay me a small salary (roughly 2k/month) through the existing parent company. To my knowledge, they don't know that I have all of these financial issues, and I really don't want them to find out, because I don't want to explain how I was short-sighted and depressed in my twenties, and I don't want them to think my judgment is still that bad, because it isn't.

10. This is the payment arrangement my partners use for their current company (let's call it P): they outsource all employment/HR stuff for company P to a third-party (which we'll call T), and all 'employees' of company P are actually employed by company T, and then T sends P an invoice for personnel costs, and P pays T as basically an outsourced provider of employee services. Company T is the company that actually administers all benefits, payment, etc to the 'employees' of company P.

11. I'm not sure if this part matters, but I have decent reason to expect that my income will increase in 2015. It's difficult to say how large the increase will be, or how soon it will happen. It could end up stabilizing around $10k/month, or perhaps as much as $20k/month. Of course, nothing is guaranteed in this world, and it may not increase at all, or it may decrease. Such is the life of an entrepreneur.


With all of that being said, here are my questions.

1. How do I handle the offer of 'employment' from my business partners? If I just accept the offer and become an employee of company T (as a way of being an 'employee' of company P), will that trigger the IRS to re-assess my situation, possibly increasing the amount of money I have to pay the IRS every month? Will my becoming an employee cause whatever collection agency has my loan (if one does) to contact my employer and garnish my wages? If so, would company P ever know about that, or would it only be company T?

2. How do I address my student loan situation in the smartest way possible? Who do I talk to about beginning to pay back the loans? Is it possible to settle them for a one-time payment, and, if so, how do I do that? Are there companies that can help me negotiate the situation, like the company I used to negotiate my tax situation with the IRS? (I've looked for some but I couldn't find any that didn't feel scammy.) Do I need to get my repayment terms worked out before I become an employee of company T and/or before my income increases in 2015, assuming that it does?

3. How do I protect my spouse from the fallout of my bad decisions years ago, at least as much as possible? I'm even thinking of us getting legally divorced (but still living together, wearing our wedding rings, and so on, so that only we would know that we were officially divorced). Would that be smart, or idiotic? Is that the best way to protect her? If it's not, then what is?

4. What kind of professional do I need to talk to about all of this stuff? A CPA? An attorney? Some other kind of pro?

5. Are there any other questions I should be answering, or options I should be considering?



I know this is a ton of stuff to take in, and I know I've done some pretty stupid things in the past. I'm trying to make good and get my financials in order, especially since we want to start a family soon and I don't want some government employee repossessing my kid, or whatever it is they do in these situations.

The thing that inspired me to make this post is that I just lost a job.  I was working 3, a full time job, a part time job nights and weekends, and an on-call job.  My part time job has just closed, so I will now be making $300-400 less a month. Just thinking about that makes my heart sink. So, here is my financial situation looks like:  


**Income** 
--Full time job, monthly  (after taxes, 401(k), Dental insurance come out): $1550
     *4 times a year, we get a 3 week paycheck, which i will be geting on january 1st, so my monthly income in January, April, July, October will actually be $1930, or so

--On Call: Varies, but I would say at least $200 a month

**Monthly Expenses:** 


Rent: $325 (half of the $650 for the apartment I share with my boyfriend)

Electricity: Roughly $20/month (Again, this is halved)

Internet: $20 (halved)

Cell Phone: $45

Car Insurance: $100 (I have comparison shopped, this is about the best I could find. this also includes renters insurance, and I actually have pretty decent coverage

Gym Membership: $22 -- I am actually using my membership, as a part of my ""Take control of my life and better it"" movement I have started...with myself...

Netflix: $8


**Debts:**

Care Credit (medical credit card, interest free if paid off in the promotional period): My cat got sick last winter and I ended up spending roughly $1600 on him, most of which went on this credit card.  The promotional period is up in February, and as of today, I only have $25 left, which will be paid on January 1st. I can't wait to get that one paid off    
**Outstanding Balance: $25**  


Car Repair Credit Card:  Luckily I have this one paid off now, but I had to have some car repair done, and I was able to use this, I paid off the $1,000 that I put on this card, and it now has a zero balance.    
**Outstanding Balance: $0**  


Credit Card #1- This card is nearly maxed out, and that scares the shit out of me and makes me really nervous... I really need to fix my situation.  
**Outstanding Balance:$4979.85  
Interest Rate: 9.99% (I work at the bank so I have a lower interest rate on this card)**  


Credit Card #2: This card is pretty much maxed out also, and that scares me even more, that both of my credit cards are.  
**Outstanding Balance: $3700  
Interest Rate: 17.15%**


Debt Consolidation Loan:  I took out this loan last year to consolidate my credit card debt... and my debt ended up growing...
 I don't have exact numbers on this one, as I am at work, but I owe $241 a month on this, and I have about 22 months left on it.  I actually pay $250 a month.  
**Outstanding Balance: Roughly $5300**


I have almost $15,000 in debt and it is all stupid debt. I am feeling extremely overwhelmed now that I have lost a job.  I am hoping to get this debt paid down, and have some savings set up.  I am trying to better my life, as I was going through some depression and I really let myself go, financially, physically, mentally.  This is my chance to better myself.

I am not sure yet if I want to look for another part time job for nights and weekends.  I was overworking myself to a point of making myself sick the last few months, working some 80 hour weeks.  It still feels like that didn't help get me anywhere. So, I would liek to make my current income work.  Otherwise, I am giving myself until mid January to either find a better paying full time job, or another part time job.

Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this, and possibly help.  It is greatly appreciated!",finance,1417560519

technology,TigerDirect Cashier wearing Google glass!,"Today, 02 December 2014 at approximately 2PM I visited a retail establishment located at 1740 N. Federal Hwy Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33305,  and I was disturbed by the conduct and operation of of several employees. The first employee that caught my attention in your store was wearing a personally owned Google glass wearable device.

While we live in an age where cameras of decent and high quality are as ubiquitous as a cell phone, this employee was operating a cash register while wearing the device and processing credit cards. While I am sure that this employee's actions were innocuous, and maybe just showing off a new technology to look trendy, I would like to point out several things which cause concern for me.

1. The camera can easily capture readable credit card numbers, and cvs codes.
2. I believe that this is a violation of PCI Compliance. If said device were to ever capture a credit card number and somehow at the user's control or at the control of others make this information appear on the public Internet you could be liable for damages including: a lawsuit, losing your credit card processing capability, and at the very least the same unfortunate publicity that has afflicted retail establishments such as Target... not to mention possible criminal charges for identity theft.
3. The device is personally owned and therefore not examined or regulated by TigerDirect's IT regulations or compliance.

I did observe at least one shopper whom refused to employ said cashier to process his purchase simply because the cashier was wearing the device. A shopper who walks away from a cashier is money that walks out your door if no other cashier is available.

What I found most disturbing was that when the customer tried to bring it to another employee's attention TigerDirect employees found this amusing and even suggested that the customer go elsewhere. Is this how your employees conduct business with customers with legitimate security concerns?

It is my opinion that if a clerk wishes to wear or display one while on the showroom floor, that would be acceptable. A little creepy maybe, but none the less acceptable by the general techno-savy public. Wearing one while manning a cashier station however is unacceptable.

23500 (about 5% of 470)
12-15k for bathroom and kitchen reno. 
closing costs are 3-4 k.

Here is the kicker...interest rates are so low that my cash flow will increase tremendously. ill be saving roughly 2200 per month extra. so all the up front costs will be recouped in about 2 years. however shelling out that much cash upfront will make a huge dent in my liquidity and our safety net. any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated!!",finance,1417573404

personalfinance,All of a sudden I am a grown up (32),"Hello PF, I have been lurking for months and have been trying to get as knowledgeable as possible. That being said I still have plenty of questions and have yet to find an answer. First some BG info. Recently married and purchased a house in October(230k). Literally just got back from our honeymoon. Wife and I make about 100k. We have a 12k car loan and 12k in student loans (both at decent interest rates ~4%). Decent emergency fund and around 60k in retirement (401ks). Now for the questions:

1. With all the additional taxes we are paying for the mortgage is there a way to see if we should lower our witholdings from our  paychecks and also estimate any additional money that might add to our paychecks?

2. Should we be throwing extra money at our debts (car/student loan,or house) or retirement.

3. Retirement: Probably what I have the most sense of. Right now we contribute about 15% to our companies 401ks. Is this the best use? Seems like a lot of people prefer using 401ks for the company match and then using Roth's. I have decent options from my company but my wife's company doesn't offer any vanguard funds and a lot of the expense ratios are around 1%. If we go the Roth route, I assume that would affect the answer to question 1.

In the spreadsheet, enter you amount borrowed into cell J5, the term (in years) into cell J4 and the interest rate into cell J3. Ta Da. You can now see your future payments over time.

You can update the interest rate if it changes over the period using column B. If you make an overpayment one month, enter it into column I and you will see the payments for your following months update.

The Washington DC-based organization, led by economist Perianne Boring, put light on certain benefits cryptocurrency technology could bring to ever-changing financial sector. Among the listeners were representatives from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Department of Commerce, and Government Accountability Office (U.S. GAO).

“With a current market capitalization of about US$5.8 billion, digital currencies are a growing force in the global marketplace and are here to stay,” she said. “As we see a generational shift led by the millennials, digital currencies will become as commonplace as email and Facebook. The Intelligence Community is a very savvy group. They are paying attention to digital currency because they know it’s the future.”

On the other hand, US federal agencies were reportedly focusing on the potential of digital currencies for financing global terrorism and likewise threats.

This was the second time in one-week when Boring was asked to represent the cryptocurrency community. She earlier appeared before the Australian Senate in order to help them create fair and logical regulations for Bitcoin users and businesses.

personalfinance,Canadian needs help for renewing a mortgage,"Hi,

My bank called last night to get me to use my option for an early renewal.

Some background:  The mortgage is in 2 parts. (RBC Homeline). Both are in a closed variable at prime - .35.  Which works out to 2.65%.  It is up for renewal in April.

We chose variable because we figured interest rates weren't going up after the debacle in the US.  So far we are winning.  People owe so much that I don't see interest rates going anywhere anytime soon.  

We are planning to sell in less than 3 years.

The variable rate they are offering is 2.45 (prime - .55) or a 5 year fixed at 3.04%.

I am thinking that variable is the way to go as it is cheaper and we will be selling soon.  

If interest rates rise they will likely go in .25% increments.  So interest rates would have to rise 3 times in 3 years for us to ""lose""

Thoughts?

personalfinance,"Girlfriend unqualified for FAFSA, need private student loans?","My girlfriend was a bit of a lost apple while in college, unknowingly choosing poor classes unrelated to her major and not being academically minded. This led to her now finishing her sixth year (potentially 6 1/2) in college. 

She's been paying all her tuition via her parents pocket, no loans, no grants, no scholarships, nothing. Luckily it is a city college so it isn't TOO expensive. However, her father just lost his job so she won't be able to do this anymore.

She's never taken out a loan before, and I think because she is in her 6th year of college (past the 150% rule) she no longer qualifies for FAFSA and additionally, any federal student loans.

Is her only option left to apply for private loans (from Sallie Mae for example?) Or are there other options available, such as scholarships? I've never taken a private student loan before so i'm unsure how to proceed.

I am 27 single male. I have 8,000 in personal credit card debt. The APR is 18.6%. I'm trying to pay this down to between 500 and 1000 dollars the best way possible. 

My current net income is around 1100 a month. Gross is about 1700. My monthly expenses are around 700 a month. 

I currently have 30 thousand in my retirement fund, split between a 403b (16,600) and a 401a (13,400) of which I am fully vested. The reason I mention this, is the investment company will allow me to take a loan out on my 403b against myself. I pay interest on it, but to myself. Unsure what the rate is, but since I'm paying it to myself I suppose that doesn't matter. 

So my thought was to take out a loan on my retirement account to pay down my heavy interest rate credit card, then pay back my retirement loan. 

Is this the best option for me, or is it ill-advised to take out a loan on my retirement fund?

Will monitor this from main account and, if necessary, PM people from there.

**Story Time:**

I'm currently working in San Francisco at a tech company (non-technical position) and make ~180K a year. Everyone that knows me thinks I have a mental disorder for even considering a new job because I literally sit around all day on Reddit and *do nothing*, but there's just something *missing* in my current work. My CEO (I report directly to him) is awesome but I worry about the future of the company.

I've an opportunity for what *seems* to be a dream job in Stockholm. I love Sweden and this company is doing incredibly well. It's a pretty high-profile position and I'd be doing exactly what I want to do. Except that the salary is going to be roughly 60-65K USD (which is apparently a decent salary there). But it's not like Stockholm is drastically cheaper to live in than San Francisco; if anything, it's even more expensive. I don't know how people do it.

On top of that, I have 110K in student loan debt from undergrad and grad school. Luckily the interest rates on most are fairly low (2.12-2.75% from undergrad because my parents cosigned - this could be a problem, I know; and 5.8% from grad school). I pay roughly $1500/mo in student loans right now and should probably be putting a bit more towards that. Thinking about paying some of them off completely before I leave (~$6000 for certain loans). **What does /r/personalfinance suggest I do about the loan situation?** Should I try to pay off more or, if I move, just pay the minimums while I'm in Sweden?

My family is not really on board with this. We never had a lot of money and aren't really material people (grew up in a farm town), so I do think I'd be content with the salary. My father says to ""follow your dreams and the money will come"" but my mother explained that people work their whole lives to get to where I'm at and I'm essentially throwing it away and worries about my future after Sweden/how easy it'd be to find a job similar to where I am now if I come back to the US.

I don't have a lot of *stuff*. My rent is astronomically expensive given the area I live in and I did just purchase a pretty fancy car that I would need to sell (this could be difficult). Other than that, I don't have a lot of possessions and I try to live fairly frugally. I know I could live in Stockholm on 60K a year, but I'm wondering how this would affect my student loan payments and other savings. And potentially any tax implications - I've done a lot of research into FATCA and it seems like an enormous headache (but that's another story for another post).

Forgive me if this is the wrong subreddit, I just trust you guys to know more about paying loans and whether or not this is a good idea in the long run.

**tl;dr** - Make 180K in San Francisco, contemplating taking job in Sweden for 60K. Have 110K in student loan debt (paying 1.5K/mo). I want to move because I'm unhappy at my job and, to be honest, really just have the itch to live abroad before I ""settle down"". How does this impact my loans and taxes? Are all my friends right that I'm super dumb for even considering this job?


**EDIT, 9:30 PM, 3 December**: Thanks for all the advice guys. I went home from work and paid off my highest interest loan ($16,400!). I'm so glad you guys really talked some sense into me. My family and friends are great, but hearing it from strangers on the Internet really made me realize I was doing everything wrong. I still want to consider the job, but it doesn't look like a smart financial decision right now to move to Sweden (and, yes, for everyone that asked - I do speak Swedish [though it's not needed there at all] and I've been there, so that's not a concern).

personalfinance,"Owe money to several banks, what do I do?","Hello good people of PF! Well I'm gonna start..
So I am a college student living at home with my parents and I wanna help out my dad, if at least by offering your advice, since he's not too internet savvy.. My family used to have a lot of money and good credit and this allowed them to get all sorts of credit cards here and in the US (We're not in the US) but we had a rough few years and (Deaths in the family, lost jobs, etc.) neither my dad or my mom can find a job due to their age, and thus my dad thought the best idea was to build a small business from scratch (Including actually making the building, permits, etc.) and putting it all on their several credit cards.


Now due to a complete disregard of the actual business, it's *going* but it's not going too well. My mom, who is the proprietary of it, is a perfectionist and takes literally 2-3 months to make a single business decision, such as how our fliers should look like, and how the place should be decorated.. It's just going forward way way too slow.

Now the current situation is as follows:


--We have our family business of renting the building for children parties, etc. We're only beggining to make about $1200 from that per month, which in my country is equal to an entry level job.


--We are renting two commercial spaces in a commercial area at $300 per month each. One of them was a business that tanked, and we're going to let go of it soon because we can't afford to keep paying it. The other one we are setting up to re-start a little business there than should give us an extra $500 per month.


--The biggest expenses are: Cellphone bills, car maintenance and gas, my and my brother's education, service bills, all of which we keep ending with late payments and extra fees because we can barely make ends meet, and my dad is desperate as he has nothing left to sell in order to get the cash.



A few good points: We own several properties in the city and around the city. We own the house we live in and a couple others. We own quite a few vehicles. Oh and thankfully, my dad retains a good credit score in the US, because he had the foresight to keep a fund there to pay for his credit, so we have no debt in the US.


On the other hand, we haven't been able to sell the properties, and our vehicles have depreciated to the point where they're more use to us than the money they're worth now.


We're getting calls and letters every week telling my dad he needs to pay his balance or face the consecuences, and now he's thinking about getting a loan in the US to pay for the debt here because his bank in the US has a much much much lower interest rate. I don't see how this is a good idea personally!

personalfinance,Help me assess my parents finances &amp; figure out their asset allocation,"My parents asked me to audit their finances and there's areas that I'm either confused about or don't understand (because I don't invest in those asset classes). Here's there situation (ballpark numbers):

* They have approximately $2.5m million saved up (excluding their personal home equity) with no debts
* They expect to spending yearly around $60K. We assume spending will grow at the inflation rate; the only exception I can think of is healthcare costs (if they run into something that medicare doesn't cover)
* They are about 2 years from retirement

As you can tell from the numbers, they have enough saved up so their main goals are to ensure that their investment balance outpaces inflation. So my key goal is to to **ensure that their investments grow at 1-2% past inflation over the next 30 years**. 

With that in mind here is there % asset breakdown:

Asset | Tax Advantaged | Taxable | Overall
:--|--:|--:|--:   
Equities | 23% | 0% | **7%**
T-bonds | 14% | 19% | **18%**
Muni bonds | 16% | 28% | **25%**
Corp bonds | 9% | 0% | **3%**
Annuities | 23% | 43% | **37%**
Pension | 6% | 0% | **2%** 
CD | 9% | 7% | **8%** 
Cash | 0% | 2% | **1%**

Here are my main concerns:

## Municipal bonds (25%)

I have no idea what is going on here. My parents invested in individual bonds while I invest through index funds so I'm can't assess their holdings. My parents make ~15K investments in bond issues for a total of 25% of their portfolio. All of the bonds they have bought are investment grade &amp; insured and are around 30 years with yields of 5%. They got into buying individual bonds from a salesman/broker of some sort (which is why I'm a bit paranoid) through FMSbonds. I have questions around:

* *Is 15K the right amount for each muni-bond?*
I assume you want to invest as little as possible in each bond in order to reduce risk of default. They have around 35 issues of ~15K which I hope is diversified enough.
* *Is bond insurance a good thing?*
Is bond insurance legit? should my parents be also screening the insurance companies? From what I saw a lot of the bond insurance companies had ratings that fell during 08 so I'm concerned. From my skeptical side it looks like bond insurance is a financial instrument used to make debt from bad credit municipalities and make it look good (which is exactly what happened in the subprime market).
* *Is it ok that my parents are putting all of their bond exposure in 30 year bonds?*
From what I know, this exposes my parents to a lot of interest rate risk. I.e. if the Fed increases increase rates (which I believe they will do) those bonds will drop in value significantly since they are long term. Is this even a concern if my parents hold to maturity (&amp; use as fixed income)? Should my parents be creating a bond ladder instead of doing all long term?
* *Is it normal to have 4.5 - 5% yield for investment grade 30 year muni bonds?* The yield rates look high to me which is why I'm wondering if these are too good to be true.
* *Taxability* - should my parents change the muni bonds to corp bonds in their tax advantaged accounts?
* What should my parents screen for in municipal bonds outside of the rating, yield to maturity/call?
* *Is there any fee / commission scams from a bond broker?*  I'm aware of all the b.s. fees for equities (load fees, commissions, etc.), but I have no idea on the bond side since I invest in funds.

## Annuities (37%)

I have no idea how these work, although from what I've heard these seem scammy. Are these an appropriate asset type for their situation (enough capital, near retirement, &amp; just trying to outpace inflation). How do these work &amp; what should I watch out for?

## Equity (7%)
I know my parents are near my retirement by my rule of thumb was you should have equity exposure between 25-75% (Ben Graham's rule) so my view was their equity exposure should be higher (closer to 30%). Given that my parents are just trying to beat inflation - am I being too aggressive here? Is 7% equity enough? *

personalfinance,My mom is spending 70% of her fixed income on her house that is in dire need of repairs. Please help!,"My mom is in a financial nightmare right now. She spends ~70% of her fixed income on the monthly mortgage payment for a house that needs a very long list of repairs. A pipe just burst this week, adding more cost to something she can already barely afford.

I have two major concerns: short term plan and long term plan. Please stick through this upcoming wall of text and help me help her!

**Short term:**

We need the pipe repaired so the water can be turned back on again. We are going to try to file an insurance claim for the burst pipe, however, we are worried they will deny it for negligence. Why? Because the house is not heated. Her HVAC system broke many years ago and she hasn't been able to save enough money to get it repaired. Over the past few winters since it broke she's been layering clothes and blankets to stay warm, and taking cold showers during the Summer to cool off. This month has been nothing but freezing temperatures which caused one of the main pipes to freeze and burst.

Assuming they deny the claim, we need some sort of plan to get it fixed. Right now the water in the house is completely shut off to avoid leaking and further damage. 

Here is some financial info:

Info | Amount
----|------
Mortgage Payment* | $1150/mo
Principal Owed | $67,000
Term of Mortgage | 30yr
Years Left | 8yr
APR/Interest Rate | ~8%

**Includes taxes and insurance*

Income | Amount
------|------
Social Security | $1300/mo
Check from me | $300/mo

She does not have a job due to medical issues.

Is our best bet applying for a small loan through her credit union to pay for the pipe repair, assuming insurance denies it?

**Long term:**

I'm worried about her health and sanity staying in a large 4br/3ba house that doesn't have essentials like HVAC or working kitchen appliances by herself. I live out of state, halfway across the country, and do what I can to help but it isn't enough. 

I'd like her to sell the house and downsize to something she can buy outright. She is terrified of doing this because she's living in a very safe, familiar neighborhood and the houses we have looked at in the price range she could afford after selling would be in some rougher neighborhoods. My father also has right of first refusal on the property as part of their divorce settlement from many years ago, which further complicates things.

She has terrible credit and has been denied for a refinance through her credit union.

Houses in her neighborhood have been selling for $250-300k. She bought this house 22 years ago for much less than that. Of course, that selling price is for a house that has been well maintained. Her house is in such a mess right now, I think she could only get $100k tops for it in as is condition. Repairs could be made to not only increase her quality of life, but also to increase the value of the house.

I'm thinking a HELOC might make sense to take care of things like the pipe burst, replacing the HVAC, replacing the non-working kitchen appliances (stove, oven, dishwasher), repairing the hazardous deck in the backyard, etc. I'm hoping that her bad credit won't get in the way of obtaining one. However, I do worry about what comes after the HELOC is done. How will she pay it back? The monthly payments are still eating her alive too.

I care the most about improving her current situation but I also can't help but think about me inheriting the house down the line, especially with over 2/3 of the mortgage paid off and with the house increasing 2.5x-3x in value. I'd fix it up and use it as a rental property. The difference between me fixing it now vs. me fixing it later is credit history and money. I'm 25 and have only had ~2 years of credit card history. Down the line my career will be more established with a higher wage and I'll have more credit history to be able to secure a loan.

I'd still rather have her sell it if that is the best resolution.

What do you suggest? 

Thanks so much,

personalfinance,Will refinancing student loan debt hurt my credit?,"I received an ad in the mail from Charter One to refinance up to $90k in student loan debt. I have more than that (about $32k that would need to be left out) but I added the highest-interest loan groups to the application until it got to $81k. I was approved but would have to choose between short and long term repayments, and variable vs fixed interest rate. Even the longer term repayment plan brings the interest down below what the loans are individually. I have one loan at 9% and another above 7%. The average is probably 6.5% added together. If I choose a long-term variable interest repayment it gets me down to 5.29%.

It seems like a good idea because of the lower interest rate, but what will this do to my credit? My score is 720 currently. Advice is appreciated!",finance,1417650879
personalfinance,Recently came into $3K. How can I spend it on my student loans (~25K) to best effect?,"Hey, as the title says, I recently came into 3K and want to get the biggest bang for my buck with respect to my student loans. But I'm having a little trouble with the math -- do I simply multiply the loan principle by the interest rate in order to calculate the total sum of interest owed on the loan? 

At any rate, here are my loans:

Loan   Principal     IR     Minimum

1-01 	$2,396.90 	6.8% 	$29.38 

1-02 	$3,276.07 	5.6% 	$38.27 	

1-03 	$4,188.24 	4.5% 	$46.80 
	
1-04 	$2,270.85 	6.8% 	$27.91 

1-05 	$5,090.03 	3.4% 	$54.27 

1-06 	$2,145.73 	6.8% 	$26.37
 
1-07 	$5,177.24 	3.4% 	$55.20 

1-08 	$1,142.22 	6.8% 	$0.00 		

As you can see, I have already been paying off 1-08 ahead of schedule, so I will definitely use a third of the 3K to KILL IT -- any inefficiency in spending that arises will be offset by sublimity of triumph. 

But what should I shovel the remainder into? Here is my current situation, which may be a little unusual. I am currently making a bunch of money and living very comfortably. I put away about $1K / mo. Half of that savings goes into loans, and the other half sits in my bank account. Why am I putting $500/mo into my bank account instead of my loans? I will be leaving my line of work in about a year and my monthly cash flow will become very uncertain; I will spend at least 3 of the following months traveling. At any rate, all of this means that my goal is ultimately to reduce my monthly payment as quickly as possible, which I suspect means paying off the low-principal high-interest loans first. This will loosen my financial burden in the coming years when my income is low and erratic.

But which ones? 1-01? 1-06?

personalfinance,Aggressively paying off student loans -- Using retirement savings going too far?,"So I started my first ""real job,"" last year.

I had accumulated 106k in student loans. (BA at University of Mount Union, in state, private, coupled with about 25k for my MBA at the University of Akron.)

My job (Extraordinarily stable -- I am guarenteed employment so long as I basically don't murder someone -- Fed Gov job qualifies for PSLF,) offer's a 3% match if you put in 5%. 


My salary is currently ~60k/year + 10k that the federal government is paying on my federal loans this year.

Next year I will make ~ 72k with none of that benefit.

I put in 8%.

The way my retirement works is that I can actually take a personal loan from myself. If I wait about 7 months the amount I can borrow will equate to approximately 7-8k. The only catch is that there is a 50$ fee that is applied when you take out the loan. The loan itself is to myself, which basically means that instead of the (currently,) outrageous 8-10% pace my accounts have headed, I will instead earn 2% on that loan as I pay it back to myself into my retirement account. I pay it back at my own pace.

I have lived a pretty bare bones lifestyle the past year but the results are pretty telling.

I am currently on IBR and will re-certify at my 2013 income level, which means I will have paid two years at extremely low level payments on my fed loans, with 8 years remaining on min payments before the ~ 45k after this next year and applying my loan forgiveness payments is completely forgiven.

Thus, I currently have about 28.4k private student loans as followed that I am trying to pay off as fast as possible.

SAE 11240	4.25%
Discover 6024	3.37%
Citi 11127.5	5%

(One of my most happy accomplishments was eliminating a predatorial 8.75% student loan from discover in the amount of 14k within a year.)

My question is whether I should use that 7-8k to help pay down the 5% citi loan (I will be applying my own ~575$/mo payment on that loan alone which would just about mean the loan I took from the retirement would kill it.)

I've been very aggressive but am to the point where I'm wondering whether the guarenteed elimination of a 5% debt is worth the sacrifice of potential compounded interest on my retirement.




Before people ask dumb questions:

Just so we get it out of the way, my single mother made too much money and FAFSA decided my family could feasibly pay about 12.5k for my college every year. I got 0 and a boat load of loans instead.

Also, for the people who like to live in a fantasy world where even with inflation student loans were like buying toilet paper to gold bars in the 70's/ in the past -- shove it. I was two years into undergrad when the recession started. There was no going back You either kept going or left, had nothing to show for it, and had a mountain of debt. In this day and age debt bondage is actually favorable to voluntarily mutilating one's own potential earnings.

personalfinance,I need some advice from rent house owners.,"This a long story so I'll try to TL/RD it later. 

Ok, at 21 I bought a house, it seemed like the right move to make. I didn't want to pay rent anymore and I had two guys who wanted badly to get out of their parents houses. 

I paid 115k it is in a good neighborhood and seemed in decent shape. Some settling had happened and a few walls had noticeable cracks. No sweat. 

I lived here for about 4 years with two room mates. One being my brother. In 2013 I was overseas and told them I would give them a cut on rent to maybe build up some savings (one guy really needed a car) I asked for 100 a month each and they get utilities in their names while I'm gone, split it how ever they see fit and make sure my dog is fed and watered. No big deal. I came back right around a year ago. As I expected there was no rent waiting. I was ok with that because a few months in I realized I had just asked people who don't know what a savings account is to sock away 100 a month for a year.. So whatever. Small peanuts. I don't get stressed over what friends owe me because I just choose not to.

When I came home I wanted for everyone to split and to do some improvements and sell the house and move on with my life. (Hobo lifestyle adventure, but that is for another post) obviously with no savings that was difficult for my renters. One moved to Seattle. And is doing great. Very happy for him. The other (my brother) got engaged to a lazy slob. Whatever, his life. He showed interest in buying the house. I said sure, in fact as a buddy and a brother, I'll just let you assume the mortgage, call it a wedding gift. 

He didn't qualify for Wells Fargo assumption, fuck. At this point him and his fiancée are already moved in, I'm out. I told him all he has to do is have utilities in his name and pay me 850 per month (that's the payment) 

It's been like three weeks since we got the letter saying the assumption wouldn't happen, I've suggested pretty regularly that he goes to other banks and tries to get approved. No movement yet. In my experience words are nice, but actions prove intent. I have seen no action towards the intent of buying the house. 

I'm fucking frustrated. Mostly because I want to join the coast guard since I hate the army, and what we do, but soldiering is really the only thing I'm very proficient at. And I can't help but help people all the damn time. I may as well get paid for it. They will take me no problem.... As long as I have no debt. Ugh

I currently have $51,000 in student loan debt. I have been paying on them for a year, started around $56,000. Interest rates range from 9.25% to several at 2.25%. Government loans are 4.5% or 6.25% depending on the loan. I'm currently paying just under $800 a month. I make $65,000 a year but even the $800 a month is killing me. It's more than my mortgage!

financialindependence,Please critique my progress so far. Thank you (xpost from /r/personalfinance,"First, this is a throwaway account, but I promise OP will deliver on questions asked by you (reason for throwaway is because I don't want my active Reddit account to connect with my personal finance health &amp; history). I was told cross posting to this subreddit will yield additional help.

Spouse and I are both 31 years old, with a baby expected May 2015. Spouse is a Public School Teacher &amp; I'm a Project Manager for Non-Profit. Spouse was late to the retirement game, so employer account and ROTH IRA contributions has only occurred the last 1 1/2 years. We are not totally banking on pension or my social security too.

After we got married (2 years so far, hooray!), it made sense to find ways to be frugal so we purchased a house with spouse's brother in law. Mortgage, property tax, utilities, and any other household expenses are all divided by 2 (not 3 because we fronted all of the down payment)

**Net Income (amount that deposits into the checking account)**: $5,133

**Expenses/Debt**

1. Mortgage: $700
2. Property Tax: $183 ($2200 per year, just budgeted down monthly to $183)
3. Internet: $17.50
4. Homeowners Association Fees: $142
5. Water: $0 (Included into HOA fee)
6. Electricity: $25
7. Gas: $10
8. Groceries: $220 (average of last 3 months)
9. Restaurants: $360 (average of last 3 months)
10. Gas for Cars: $150 (average of last 3 months)
11. Shopping/Fun Money/Entertainment: $235 (average of last 3 months)
12. Life Insurance: $120 ($1 million, 30 year term life for each of us; just got them in the last week)
13. Car Insurance: $200 (both of us)
14. Roth IRA contribution: $916 (both of us)

**Total Monthly Expenses**: $3,278.50


**Assets**

1. 2005 Mazda 6, ~90K miles, paid off
2. 2009 Nissan Altima, ~45K miles, paid off
3. Amex High Yield Savings: $108K (Interest rate, 0.80%, thinking of down payment on another house for rental, perhaps?)
4. Checking Account: $9K
5. CD: $50,838 (5 separate CDs, 1-5 year ladder. Value includes interest accrued YTD)
6. 401K &amp;amp; 403b: $18K (combined total; I have 4% match, spouse does not have match; I contribute 35% and spouse contributes 20%)
7. Roth IRA: $83K (combined total)
8. Rollover IRA: $69K (from my previous employer)
9. Self Managed Brokerage Account: $4,500 (not too serious about it...it's in stock symbol: VTI)
10. US Treasury I-Bonds: $20K

Also, we both recognize how fortunate we were to have received grants in undergrad and had parental support for graduate school. We are very privileged in that sense and hope to provide that support for our child on the way.

Retirement accounts are either invested in low expense ratio Vanguard Target Retirement Fund or ETF Lazy 3 Portfolio fund (depending on the retirement vehicle).

**Update from PF Feedback**

I was advised that I should divert about $60K from AMEX savings to either a 529 or into my Self-Managed Brokerage Account and do a lazy portfolio there using Vanguard Admiral Shares. I am definitely open to that, but leaning less on the 529 account because child can borrow for student loans, but we can't borrow for retirement. Also, my state does not have added benefits for the 529.

I am able to max out retirement account contribution, but for my spouse, slowly easing the way there; gradually increasing in 5% increments to take out the ""sticker shock"" on monthly net income.

With baby on the way, we are also trying to anticipate a steady increase in expenses for a newborn. Fortunately, we have a nephew and are already slated for hand me downs of furniture, toys, and clothes.

personalfinance,"Closed Amex account, question about their recommended credit counseling","In February 2014 entered into Amex's payment plan because I could not meet my minimum payment.

Amex has already closed the account back in Feb.  The monthly payment plan amount is $660, the minimum payment due on the account is $389.

Amex recommends credit counseling, I haven't called the number they provide because I wanted some opinions here first.  The customer service rep at Amex cancelled my direct payment that was due for this month, I guess that will qualify as a ""missed"" payment and I'll get hit with a high interest rate and missed payment fee, but then might just have to start making the minimum payment due, which I can probably do.

I had to move away from my family because all of my money and time was going to them. I lived in a family home, but still paid rent, but this isn't considered ""renting"" so when I moved, options were limited.

personalfinance,PSA: Federal Student Loan Consolidation has Fees? Becareful of Great Lakes!!!,"So I just my consolidated federal student loans.  I knew there was no application fee (federal consolidation) or any other fee (because I called Great Lakes to ask them before) and they said there were none.  But after the consolidation the total went up by a couple thousand dollars.

When I asked why it was higher they gave me some BS about how interest, fees when consolidating would add that, they do this whole work around.  Then I told them to add the total payoff amount from each loan I consolidated in the payment history.  I told them to compare that total to the consolidated amount.  They didn't know what to say after that and changed their tune quickly and a supervisor would call me in 24 to 48 hours.  I asked would they payback the interest on the extra amount they added and they didn't know.

What blows my mind is that they payoff amount is on their site for each loan I consolidated and that total doesn't match up with the disbursed consolidated amount.  How does that even happen?  Second, I had to do all the work to specifically ask them to go to each loan and add up the payoff amounts for them to compare.  The people were trying too hard to get me off the phone.  If someone were to call inquiring about a discrepancy, the first thing they should do would be to add up the payoff amounts and compare, but they don't.  Took me about an hour of my time and who knows how much more it would take.

I'm sure this hasn't happened to just me so please compare your payoff amount with the new consolidated total.

EDIT.  So the supervisor called and just hung up on me without trying to keep working with me on the issue.

EDIT 2.  So I talked to someone supposedly higher up than a supervisor and they understood my issue like the customer service representative and now I have to wait 24 to 48 hours for another person to look into the issue and call me.  I don't understand why the supervisor would hang up on me, if i explained it in the same way to this higher up and the first customer service representative.  I asked the higher up for the supervisor's name but she said her file didn't show the name but that it was me who hung up first because I wasn't listening to the supervisor's explanation, which wasn't true.  So this higher up has a log of my previous calls but doesn't have the name of the supervisor?  This is funny because even the customer service representative knew the name of the other customer service representative I was talking too before my phone died and I had to call again.  So when even a customer service representative has information with a name, a higher up doesn't have a supervisor's name on file?

How much higher up the chain do I have to go for this issue to be fixed when clearly they see an issue too?  It is so frustrating to see this is how money is handled.",finance,1417716043

personalfinance,What to do with Credit Card for newly weds *Long Post*,"*DISCLAIMER* We are not financial experts of any kind and if there is anything below that I seem misinformed about please instead of just criticizing leave constructive helpful information correcting me. I am doing my best to learn here.

OUR GOALS:

Have 2 Credit Cards that is best for us as a family.

Receive best incentive's.

Interest rate shouldn't be a big concern we never buy anything we don't have the cash in the bank for and we pay both cards off in full every month, no exceptions.

Off the top of my head since the budget isn't in front of me here are some figures if it matters at all.

We have roughly $4,000 in the bank once all bills are paid and fridge is stocked. We bring in ~$4,000-$4,500 / month (she is salary but it ranges based on my overtime and bonuses). Our bills total in the neighborhood of $2,000-$2,200 ($910 of that is mortgage). We tuck away $300-$700 in to a money mutual account each month depending on what unforeseeable events may occur or if we have any vacations/big plans.



We are 26 Newly weds. My wife has always been great with money a big saver and has never missed a payment and has never failed to pay her Credit cards off in full every month.

We only have 2 Credit Cards. Both still in her name (We just got her last name changed and we are going to get new cards mailed with both names.)

She has a Credit score in the 740-780 range. I have a much worse credit score due to stupidity when I was 18 along with Student Loans we are paying off. I would range my score in the mid 500's. We are working at rebuilding that.

Our first Credit Card is actually a card she opened when she was 16 with her Mother on the account. It had a $500 limit then and she has built the limit of this up to around $16,000. We never exceed $2,000 and really average around $1,000-$1,200 on this card as that is what our budget allows for (Most of this is monthly bills charged directly to the card if that matters, we figured it helped us with rewards points since we pay off in full anyway.)

Our second card is one she opened 2-3 years ago. Again it started with a $500 limit but because of the type of card it is, the limit never goes up. The First card's limit has been raised 2 times since we've had this card. This card also does not accumulate rewards at all.

Both of these cards are through our bank 5/3 (Fifth Third). 

We are going in tomorrow to get new cards with new names on them since they still have her maiden name and my name isnt on the cards at all (My name is already on the bank account as a whole, Checking, Savings, and both cards.)

We would like to take advantage of a card that can give us rewards and that will have a limit that will increase over time since this second card is not. That will increase our debit to available credit ratio which improves our credit score (Is this correct?).  The rewards alone are reason enough for wanting to switch, but also it is always nice to have that safety net in case something traumatic happened and we needed a higher limit.

So the main question's are the following:

1) What do we do with the Credit Card with the $500 limit? Cancel it? Doesn't cancelling a credit card hurt your credit score?

2) Do we need to be concerned with her mother still being on our main credit card? Both my wife and her Mother share all the same values when it comes to finance, since that is where my wife learned everything. The only way to get Mother off main credit card is to close it and open a new one which will drop our available limit back down according to the bank. (Not back to $500 but less than the $16,000 limit it has.)

3) Should we be looking elsewhere aside from the Mastercards' our bank offers for a Credit Card? There are so many options, incentive's, and rakeback, its tough to know where to go, and its a bit overwhelming which is why we were just going to go for the Bank's card since that is turf we know.

If any of these figures or situations I have given don't make sense PM me or reply here and I will do my best to clarify or double check my wording and numbers. Most numbers are off the top of my head and rough estimates since I don't have the budget in front of me at the moment.

personalfinance,"Job offer - Q's about 401k, monthly expenses, student loans, etc.","Hi PF,

I received a job offer (finally!!) today after facing nearly 7 months of unemployment after graduation. I have some questions.

I only spoke with the HR rep over the phone about all this information (more extensive information to be received via email tomorrow). The salary is $58k/year. I am assuming taxes will take away 30% from each paycheck, so each paycheck comes out to be ~$1691. (I did $58000/year * 1 year/12 months * 1 month/2 paychecks * 0.7, let me know if this math is wrong). So ~$3,382/month. 

The HR rep told me that the company matches 100% of 401k contributions for the first 3%, and then 50% for the next 3%. What does this mean?

Loans: I currently owe ~$54k in student loans and ~$20k on an auto loan. 

~$28k are federal loans (Great Lakes, Unsubsidized and Subsidized Loans). The lowest interest rate is 3.4% and the highest is 6.8%. 

~20k are Sallie Mae loans. Two of them; interest rates are 9.25% and 9.7%. 

State Loan is ~$6k and the interest rate is 7.35%. 

Car Loan is ~$20k with a 2.9% interest rate.

Questions on loans: Should I consolidate my federal loans? There are a total of 8 loans (4 sub, 4 unsub). When I pay off this loan, the account balance is the sum of all the loans. How is the payment disbursed? Evenly across the board?


Monthly expenses:

Car payment: $323 (should I pay more?)

Auto insurance: $181 (to be lowered to $173 in January)

Spotify Premium: $11

Gas: Should be around $100 or so each month when I begin working
Great Lakes: Min payment is around $300, how much more should I contribute? 

Cable (my parents): ~$240

Total: ~$1200.

Sallie Mae loans currently have no minimum payment. How much should I pay each month? (individual balances, ~$12k, ~$8k). How about the State Loan? I also want to begin putting money away for an emergency fund, and later, for a moving out fund. I also want to have some money for entertainment. (Nothing too extreme). I forgot to mention I have NO credit card debt.

Other questions: Should I also save money into an IRA while I am paying off my loans? Is it okay to pay more on my car loan? Is there anything I missed/overlooked/incorrect? Let me know if you need more info/if I was unclear about anything.

Current job in the UK (SE) - £50K.

Have 12 years left on current mortgage, balance of 50K @0.5% interest rate - tracker.  
£350/month mortgage. So could bank approx. £290K assume I have to pay off the mortgage despite the cheep rate.

I've been monitoring the USD/GDP. Back in July it was 1.7, today (Dec 5, 14) it's 1.56.
So x-rate and house prices have been constantly in my mind and at $29K difference with each point it's the sort of thing you could become obsessive over:
290K * 1.5 = 435000 , 290K * 1.6 = 464000, 290K * 1.7 = 493000

So is now a good time to sell up and ship out?  Sell the house, keep the money in the UK and send later hoping x-rates return towards 1.7.  Is renting the house out at approx. £1100 per/month and keep paying the cheep mortgage a good plan, bearing in mind the long term plan is to return back to the UK, in say 5-10 years or should I gamble on house prices falling in the UK and the x-rate being more favourable when I return?

economy,My Analysis: How the Fed unwound its balance sheet after World War 2...Parallels to today?,"In an effort to determine how the Fed will unwind its balance sheet, i looked at history and found that in fact, there was a time in the past where the Federal Reserve's Balance sheet was as big as it is today.  

After looking through this article:

http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/articles/?id=2464

___________________

I found this graph (showing Fed balance sheet as % of GDP)

http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/2014/a/images/fig2_balancesheet.png

_________________

We can see that as a % of GDP, 1945 and 2014 are very similar.   

**We can also see there was a gradual unwinding of the Feds Balance sheet from 1945-1984...going from 20% of GDP to 5% of GDP.  How was this possible?**
_____________________
as alway interest rates are very important:

-The 10 year gov interest rate throughout the 1940s and 1950s stayed at under 3% until 1958

-Throughout the 1960s it gradually wnet from 3% to 6%

-Throughout th 1970s it gradually wnet from 6% to 12%

-1980-1984 saw interest rates stay in the 11-15% range

at this point i'm assuming you know how the fed/treasury create money...if not see linked comment below for my 1 page quick description:

So, if you want to decrease the Fed's balance sheet, you must decrease the supply of money in the system

How does this work? Treasury must issue new t-Bills to pay back principal on old t-bills to the Fed...These new t-bills (issued gradually from 1950-1984 or so) are paid for by general public with fed Notes...this reduces fed notes/money supply in circulation. So public gives fed notes to Treasury in exchange for new t-bills.  Treasury gives these just received fed notes back to Federal Reserve as principal payment for old t-bills issued in/around 1945). This reduces the Fed's balance sheet as the Federal Reserve gets more and more fed notes back from the Treasury (who in turn got those same fed notes from the general public in exchange for new bills).  Overall money supply decreases in proportion to amt that the Treasury has to pay back to the Fed. Is this what happened from 1945-1984? and is it reasonable to expect the same going forward (2015-2055)?

Lets look at the numbers:



Year | Fed Balance Sheet as % of GDP | M2 Money Supply as % of GDP 
---|---|----|----|----
1945 | 20% | 70% |
1984 | 5% | 55% |

**We can see that we basically traded a lower money supply in the general economy for a lower fed balance sheet.  15% of GDP over 40 years (0.375% of GDP per year)...Not too bad! very gradual reduction in the money supply and Fed balance sheet.  Slow enough to not cause any major major shocks** (i realize 1945-1984 did have problems, but no huge depressions)
_____

**Today the Fed balance sheet as a % of GDP is about 20%.  M2 Money Supply as a % of GDP is at about 65%.  If we can graudally move M2 to GDP ratio to 50%, we should get a Fed balance sheet of 5% of GDP by 2050 or so without any major disruptions.  Thoughts?**  


Tl;DR Fed Balance Sheet went from 20% of GDP in 1945 to 5% of GDP in 1984...accomplished by the shrinking of money supply from 70% of GDP in 1945 to 55% in 1984.  As Fed Balance Sheet increases, money supply increases, and visa versa.  We can do something similar going forward without an appocolypse",finance,1417741556

personalfinance,My husband's car was repossessed in Kansas 3 days ago - I have some questions,"I'll start from the beginning. My husband immigrated from Australia about 4 years ago. We moved to Kansas 3 years ago and approximately 10 months after we moved to Kansas, he took our 2 year old daughter ""to the store"" and came home with a new-to-us car with just a few miles on it. 

He put no down payment on it, and his credit score was decent then but he did not discuss anything with me and ended up agreeing to pay $450/mo for this car that is not a luxury vehicle by any means. It is a 2011 Mazda CX-7. 

Now, my husband is terrible with money but he is the only one who works as I stay at home with my daughter. He never lets me have access to the bank account and if I need money I have to let him know. Very controlling, but that's another story for another time. I have been asking for 3 years to construct a budget that will allow us to pay our bills on time and save some money for retirement. It has never happened and we have fallen further and further behind. 

Back to the car - we have been making payments each month, but some months we were only able to pay a small amount because my husband squandered away our money. It got to the point that we were about 2.5 payments in arrears. The lender has been calling our house to speak to him and he won't talk to them. So, 3 days ago I looked out and there goes our car... Luckily he sacked up and got my daughter's car seat out before they left, but our passports and mail key are still in the car. 

He finally called the lender and it has taken them 3 days to decide whether they want him to catch up the arrears or pay the loan off. They want the arrears plus the payment that is due in a few days and then $350 on top of that for a repo fee. Then the tow guys want around $400 for storage fees. I am fed up by this point and flat-out told him we can't afford to pay that and we can't afford to keep the car. Let it go. So that's what we've decided.

Now - after all that, here is my question: We asked the lender (Wells Fargo) when the car would be auctioned. They did not know. We asked if we could attend to see how much it sold for and she said no, because they only sell to dealers. We then asked how we would know how much they sold it for so we would know that the remaining balance on the loan was correct and she couldn't (or wouldn't) give us a straight answer. She just kept saying they ""would sell it for as much as they could"". 

Are we truly not allowed to go to this auction? And how do we find out how much the car sold for? I do not know how this works as I own my car. Do we just trust what they tell us? I don't care about the car as I didn't want it (or the payments) in the first place. I just don't want the lender double-dipping on the loan. I hope that makes sense! Sorry this is so long - thanks if you took the time to read it.",finance,1417750905
worldpolitics,"""Reckless Congress Declares War On Russia"" By Ron Paul","Today the US House passed what I consider to be one of the worst pieces of legislation ever. H. Res. 758 was billed as a resolution “strongly condemning the actions of the Russian Federation, under President Vladimir Putin, which has carried out a policy of aggression against neighboring countries aimed at political and economic domination.”

In fact, the bill was 16 pages of war propaganda that should have made even neocons blush, if they were capable of such a thing.

These are the kinds of resolutions I have always watched closely in Congress, as what are billed as “harmless” statements of opinion often lead to sanctions and war. I remember in 1998 arguing strongly against the Iraq Liberation Act because, as I said at the time, I knew it would lead to war. I did not oppose the Act because I was an admirer of Saddam Hussein – just as now I am not an admirer of Putin or any foreign political leader – but rather because I knew then that another war against Iraq would not solve the problems and would probably make things worse. We all know what happened next.

That is why I can hardly believe they are getting away with it again, and this time with even higher stakes: provoking a war with Russia that could result in total destruction!

If anyone thinks I am exaggerating about how bad this resolution really is, let me just offer a few examples from the legislation itself:

The resolution (paragraph 3) accuses Russia of an invasion of Ukraine and condemns Russia’s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. The statement is offered without any proof of such a thing. Surely with our sophisticated satellites that can read a license plate from space we should have video and pictures of this Russian invasion. None have been offered. As to Russia’s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, why isn’t it a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty for the US to participate in the overthrow of that country’s elected government as it did in February? We have all heard the tapes of State Department officials plotting with the US Ambassador in Ukraine to overthrow the government. We heard US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland bragging that the US spent $5 billion on regime change in Ukraine. Why is that OK?

The resolution (paragraph 11) accuses the people in east Ukraine of holding “fraudulent and illegal elections” in November. Why is it that every time elections do not produce the results desired by the US government they are called “illegal” and “fraudulent”? Aren’t the people of eastern Ukraine allowed self-determination? Isn’t that a basic human right?

The resolution (paragraph 13) demands a withdrawal of Russia forces from Ukraine even though the US government has provided no evidence the Russian army was ever in Ukraine. This paragraph also urges the government in Kiev to resume military operations against the eastern regions seeking independence.

The resolution (paragraph 14) states with certainty that the Malaysia Airlines flight 17 that crashed in Ukraine was brought down by a missile “fired by Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.” This is simply incorrect, as the final report on the investigation of this tragedy will not even be released until next year and the preliminary report did not state that a missile brought down the plane. Neither did the preliminary report – conducted with the participation of all countries involved – assign blame to any side.

Paragraph 16 of the resolution condemns Russia for selling arms to the Assad government in Syria. It does not mention, of course, that those weapons are going to fight ISIS – which we claim is the enemy -- while the US weapons supplied to the rebels in Syria have actually found their way into the hands of ISIS!

Paragraph 17 of the resolution condemns Russia for what the US claims are economic sanctions (“coercive economic measures”) against Ukraine. This even though the US has repeatedly hit Russia with economic sanctions and is considering even more!

The resolution (paragraph 22) states that Russia invaded the Republic of Georgia in 2008. This is simply untrue. Even the European Union – no friend of Russia – concluded in its investigation of the events in 2008 that it was Georgia that “started an unjustified war” against Russia not the other way around! How does Congress get away with such blatant falsehoods? Do Members not even bother to read these resolutions before voting?

In paragraph 34 the resolution begins to even become comical, condemning the Russians for what it claims are attacks on computer networks of the United States and “illicitly acquiring information” about the US government. In the aftermath of the Snowden revelations about the level of US spying on the rest of the world, how can the US claim the moral authority to condemn such actions in others?

Chillingly, the resolution singles out Russian state-funded media outlets for attack, claiming that they “distort public opinion.” The US government, of course, spends billions of dollars worldwide to finance and sponsor media outlets including Voice of America and RFE/RL, as well as to subsidize “independent” media in countless counties overseas. How long before alternative information sources like RT are banned in the United States? This legislation brings us closer to that unhappy day when the government decides the kind of programming we can and cannot consume – and calls such a violation “freedom.”

The resolution gives the green light (paragraph 45) to Ukrainian President Poroshenko to re-start his military assault on the independence-seeking eastern provinces, urging the “disarming of separatist and paramilitary forces in eastern Ukraine.” Such a move will mean many more thousands of dead civilians.

To that end, the resolution directly involves the US government in the conflict by calling on the US president to “provide the government of Ukraine with lethal and non-lethal defense articles, services, and training required to effectively defend its territory and sovereignty.” This means US weapons in the hands of US-trained military forces engaged in a hot war on the border with Russia. Does that sound at all like a good idea?

There are too many more ridiculous and horrific statements in this legislation to completely discuss. Probably the single most troubling part of this resolution, however, is the statement that “military intervention” by the Russian Federation in Ukraine “poses a threat to international peace and security.” Such terminology is not an accident: this phrase is the poison pill planted in this legislation from which future, more aggressive resolutions will follow. After all, if we accept that Russia is posing a “threat” to international peace how can such a thing be ignored? These are the slippery slopes that lead to war.

This dangerous legislation passed today, December 4, with only ten (!) votes against! Only ten legislators are concerned over the use of blatant propaganda and falsehoods to push such reckless saber-rattling toward Russia.

Here are the Members who voted “NO” on this legislation. If you do not see your own Representative on this list call and ask why they are voting to bring us closer to war with Russia! If you do see your Representative on the below list, call and thank him or her for standing up to the warmongers.

personalfinance,27 &amp; looking for tips on cutting expenses,"A little bit of personal history for you:
I moved to Chicago a little over a year ago to get out of the small town that I grew up in where there were very few job opportunities. Before leaving, I was making $9/hr as a college grad working full time at a newspaper. I'm in a much better position job-wise now (although I'm far from making what many would consider decent money), but still have relatively little experience regarding living in a big city and its associated costs.

Long story short, I was wondering what some of the monetary wizards in /r/personalfinance do to cut down on the costs of living in a major metro so you can focus on paying down debt (student loans in my case) and building up your savings.

Financial info for those that are curious:

- I have almost zero savings right now. This was depleted when I took a couple months away from work to hike a chunk of the Appalachian Trail. I realize that I need to fix that, but that's why I'm asking these questions about cutting costs.

- Average bi-weekly net pay is roughly $850 if I work no overtime, although I generally manage to work at least a few hours of OT here and there.

- Regarding monthly expenses, rent is $600, student loans are $185 car payment is $160, car insurance is $75, utilities are around $45, and phone is $40.

- I found the average of my spending in three major categories over the last eight months: Gas ($260), Dining/Entertainment ($256), and Groceries ($160). Part of reason for the high numbers for gas and D/E can be attributed to the fact that I found it difficult to make time to cook before getting my current job because of a very demanding work schedule resulting in a lot of eating out, my girlfriend lives roughly 70 miles away because of grad school, that's factoring in over a month of travel for my AT hike, and up until recently I was commuting 28 miles each way for work. 

- As far as debt goes, the only two factors are my student loans and car note; I have zero outstanding credit card debt and a decent credit score at this point in my life (798). My student loan balance was $21,854 as of last month. The majority of the loans are subsidized Stafford loans and I have no private loans from school, so everything that I've taken out is eligible for consolidation although I haven't consolidated yet. If consolidated, the interest rate would be set at 6%. As for the car, I currently owe approximately $2300 before it will be paid off.

Anyway, any tips that you guys can offer for cutting down on expenses while living in a big city and still being able to enjoy yourself are greatly appreciated by this small-town redditor!",finance,1417771980

personalfinance,"Going to transfer soon, what to do with my ""underwater"" home?","Both my wife and I work with the same company, and next year will have an opportunity to transfer to a state that will offer much better quality of living.  Aside from our mortgage, we have no debt, we fully fund our 401k’s every year, and are able to pay off all our purchases every month, and manage to save a little as well.

So, the situation is this:  In 2005, at the height of the real estate bubble, we bought our first home for $330k.  It’s currently on a variable interest rate (2.75% this year).  We owe $265k, and our mortgage is around $1800, including all taxes and insurance.  About 1 year after we bought it, the market crashed, and for our mountain community, the home values have not recovered.  Right now, we could probably sell our home for $215k.

For theupcoming transfer, we will have about $80k saved up to put down on our new home.  We are looking in the area of $400k home price.  We both have excellent credit, both of our FICO scores above 800.

My question is, should I short-sell my current home?  I know this will impact our credit score dramatically.  That’s not too much of a concern as far as buying with credit cards, or even car loans, since we pay the balance off every month, and both cars are doing well.  What I don’t know, is if I buy our new home for $400k, then walk away from our current mortgage, can this affect our new loan’s interest rate, if we get it locked in to a 30 year fixed?

The other option is to rent the underwater home out until the value comes up, but it’s been 9 years and hasn’t done so yet, and I would only be able to get about $1200/month for the home, and would then have to deal with renters, potentially non-paying renters, etc.

personalfinance,A little razzled with managing debt,"Hi everyone,

I'm a student in a bit of a sticky situation financially. I don't want handouts, but I do want advice. 

Preamble (feel free to skip ahead):
I'm married and have about $9000 in credit card debt from medical bills to tuition but by far the biggest expense was living for a quarter when my previous university stiffed me on financial aid AFTER I moved and secured living space.

I'm now living with my partner and have been diligently working at school and doing better than I ever have. My credit card balances are not in the best of shape, however. We keep your bank accounts separate and she works, covering our rent and utilities and putting other expenses on my credit cards (gas and minor purchases). I used to manage her budget but stopped when she signed up for ~$2000 worth of treatment for her back which she needs, but wasn't in the budget. She stills spends on the cards and I have mixed feelings about this. 

Here's my problem:
I've been trying hard to pay down my debt (and hers, previously) with my student loan refunds. I've run into trouble with my new financial aid office: they refuse to adjust my estimated cost of attendance for tuition until two weeks into the quarter. I take 18 credits instead of the estimated 12 and financial aid has already been dispersed two weeks before the quarter starts. I also take classes through the Summer which doesn't net me added aid. Plus, my Computer Science classes cost about double my other classes. To top it off, I made the foolish mistake of not realizing that my Chase Sapphire doesn't come with an intro APR and I've been getting charged $65/month in interest. To kick while I'm down, the government is considering cutting my food stamps because I'm going to school. 

I've looked for jobs to supplement my aid but haven't had much luck. Additionally, a friend of mine agreed to consign on a student loan with me for one year, this year, and my future aid is up in the air. 

I don't know what to do. Should I try to pick up a trade and find some trained jobs? Should I take fewer credits? Should I ignore this problem until finals week is over? I'm totally at a loss. Even if I stopped all spending to my credit cards right this moment, I can't foresee paying off this massive debt burden. 

Here's a rough breakdown:

* Chase Sapphire: ~$5000/5000 (charging interest)*
* Discover IT: ~$900/1000
* Capital One Quicksilver: $~3000/3000*
* Chase Amazon.com: $~400/500
* Amazon Store Card: $0/2500?
* Walmart Store Card: $0/3000?
* USAA Platinum: $0/500?
* Chase Freedom: $0/3000
* U.S. Bank REI Visa: $0/5000
* Authorized User on Goodyear card: (some balance my wife is carrying)
* Amex Green: $0

I don't know if these will be helpful, I swear I'm not trying to brag about how many cards I have. 
* Partner is an authorized user on these cards.

Sidenote: Discover originally denied me for a private student loan without a cosigner, accepted me with my friend who agreed for one-year. I received an 'invitation' to apply for a student loan next year. Does this mean anything, or is it just marketing fluff?",finance,1417822157
investing,401(K) question,"26/m. My work gives me a 401(K) through Fidelity. The way I've always judged whether I'm doing well with my investments or not is to, around this time of the year, look at the 'Your Personal Rate of Return from 01/01/2014 - 12/04/2014' line, which for this year is 13.05%. To me, that's a great interest rate. What I want to know from the theoretical boffins here is...is that actually a good rate? I hear people at other companies say their 401(K)s go up by 26-30%, but most of them also admit to having 'a guy' manage it for them. I assume this is some sort of service I'd have to pay Fidelity for.

So yea, those are my questions:

1. Is 13% a good rate of return.
2. Am I missing out on another 12% by not having a 'man' manage my 401(K) for me? (13% - 1% assumed fee)?

personalfinance,"Eight months pregnant, absolutely terrified, and need advice on whether to file bankruptcy pro se.","TL;DR: Ironic, typical life story about a stupidly broke yet honestly trying married couple that is expecting their first baby in a month. Time is up, and bankruptcy has been decided on. Do we really need a lawyer or is it doable to file by ourselves?

My husband and I are way over our heads as far as debt is concerned. We have it all--medical bills, credit card debt, our cars are in default. I've borrowed against my 401k (yup, we've made every mistake in the book) and now we are drowning and have no way of paying back anything, let alone, everything. We own nothing of value, yet we've always tried to do the honest thing. 

Once upon a time, we were working on paying down a huge chunk of our credit card debt (which we were pretty darn successful with), we were current on our car loans and our medical bills were manageable. We were both working full-time.

Then I, being the main source of income, was unable to work due to a medical condition that left me hospitalized (yay, more medical debt). As that was happening, we also found out that we were expecting our first baby. Want to hear about irony? Two weeks prior, we had had a talk about wanting to get into a better financial situation before starting a family--you know, the responsible thing for a married couple to do. I had taken Plan B when the condom failed because we didn't want to bring a baby into this world without having the means to support him. Needless to say, our plans and priorities changed as soon as we saw that little heart beat on the monitor. This was our baby and we were going to do everything that we could to protect him.

We went into starvation mode--cut all spending, counted pennies. I qualified for WIC, and honestly, those checks were the only things keeping us fed some weeks, but it was okay because we were positioning ourselves for a better future by allowing me time to heal and my husband to train for a better employment opportunity. Family helped out by keeping us afloat. It was rough, but we kept pushing through. Things have slowly started to improve--I have been pushing through a rough pregnancy (understatement of the year) and working full time, and my husband found a better paying job. An extremely long commute, too much time away from home, but it's what needs to be done to get his foot in the door at an even better company later down the line.

We are now out of time. I am due next month, and will be out of work for 6-8 weeks afterwards. We have spent any ""extra"" money on bare necessities for the baby. We've stocked our pantry with canned goods and dry foods for meals later on when the going gets really rough (which it will, and we are better prepared this time around). Paying back our creditors has become low priority--we are focused on survival, and on future basic needs. 

The decision to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy has been made. It's not a quick fix, we know, but it's the best option for us at this point. Being reasonably organized and diligent, is this something that can realistically be done ourselves? Or are we better off somehow dealing with the irony of paying $1,700 for a lawyer when we can barely scrape by as it is?",finance,1417825508
personalfinance,Is there an easy and/or free way to see what debts I owe and to whom?,"A few years ago I had a mental breakdown, and during this period of time I accrued some unknown amount of debt to an unknown number of people. I've gotten some of them under control (my 2 personal school loans), but I'm having 2 specific issues.

1) I don't know where my federal school loan is anymore. A year ago I received a call from a collection agency that said I was in default, and the agency needed to collect payments for 10 months before I was out of default and the original loan holder would receive payments again. This collection agency only operated by phone and paper, so I set up direct deposit and let it do it's thing after confirming that the Debt of Education was indeed receiving these payments ultimately. 

Well, I'm a fucking idiot, and I haven't been paying attention to my bank account since June. Apparently my last DD payment was in May, and now I have no idea what the status of my federal loan is, or even where to start looking. I thought Sallie Mae had it, but Sallie Mae redirects me to Navient, and Navient says I don't have a balance at this time. So now what? I assume I'm in default again, but I don't know where to even start looking.

2) I don't really know what other debt I have. I have some credit card debt (2k) that I'm sitting on until the spring and then I'll haggle them down to about $900 (the last collection agency was asking me 1k for a settlement).

Other than that, idk. I might have some medical debt floating around somewhere probably.

I've got a question about state taxes that is really frustrating me. I tried applying for a credit card and was declined, to my unwelcomed surprise. I know now I should have checked my credit report before completing this application to clear up any discrepancies but I'm still learning many of these things, slowly.

Long story even longer, after checking my credit report I found I had a state tax lien. It dates back to when I worked in Arkansas last year, but was not filed until April of this year. I am active duty military, and my home of record was Illinois, which does not impose a state tax on Active Duty Military income. I worked and lived in Arkansas but my state of residence was still legally Illinois. Does Arkansas have any ground in say I owe them $2,171 even though I wasn't a resident of their state or is this simply an error I can clean up?

Any information or a point in the right direction is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Purpose of Bonds in your portfolio,"I have always been very reluctant to own bonds in my portfolio because I am investing for the long term and can tolerate volatility.  I recently read [Why Bother with Bonds](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PL7WS16/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) where the author Rick Van Ness makes the argument that the role of Bonds should be to preserve capital by limiting risk. My take away from his book is that if you are going to take money out of the stock market to reduce risk, you should be buying short to medium term US government bonds/bond funds because it is only these near zero risk investments whose value is not correlated to the stock market that will preserve capital in an economic downturn.  Corporate bonds and other high yield bond fund performance is correlated to the stock market (ie stocks go down, corporate bond funds go down, stocks up..bonds up) although perhaps not to the same degree.  If you are putting money into bonds with the idea that you want better total return than a US government treasury fund, why put it in bonds at all? 

So I guess I'm questioning the wisdom of the three fund lazy portfolio strategy that puts money into a ""Total Bond Fund""...  I just don't understand the point of intentionally investing in an asset class that will deliver lower returns over the long term than equity based funds especially because the risk to principle is still present with these funds..risks due to interest rates, and general economic risks.

I'd like to  get your  opinion on how I manage our credit cards. Backstory on our situation  is in our past we screwed up royally with managing  credit cards and pretty much all our financial decisions. Basically  we did everything wrong! Racked up high interest  debt, paid minimum payments etc. We filed BK 3 years ago and  this last year we decided  we learned our lesson and started using credit again.

We have the 3 credit cards listed below.

Amex - used only for Costco groceries  and Costco gas. We earn points for various  rewards.

CAP1 Quick Silver -1.5% cash back on anything, anytime. Love  this  card makes the cash  back process simple and painless!

Discover It -5% cash back in revolving categories, everything else is 1%. Earning and redeeming rewards is a PITA but 5% beats 1.5% in dome categories some of the time.

The Discover card is new and is being treated a litte different right now. This one we aren't  paying off the balance each month as its interest free untill 11/15. We are only using this for Xmas and a couple semi large purchases we wanted an interest free loan  on. I do have  the cash in a high interest savings account (earning a whopping  .9% interest) to cover the balance but I  prefer to earn a little  interest, get my cash rewards. I pay over the minimum each month - about $100 + using cash rewards from both QS and Discover. This will be paid in full before the intrrest free period  expires.

Honestly I don't know what the interest rates are because we dont pay interest.

We pay everything we can on our credit cards for the cash back rewards. The way I stay on track and make sure we dont overspend is each CC transaction is logged into my check book register. Then each month I pay the current statement balance. I also d/l my transactions each week  I pay bills to confirm all transactions were all logged.

So far this has kept us honest and in control of  our CC spending in addition to earning a few hundred bucks. It gets confusing at times in the event of a return but I think the results are  worth it. Most of the time for small returns I don't  log those in our check book register so it sits as a cash buffer in our checking account. 

My SO thinks I am making more work and complicating the matter by logging everything  in our check book. I  think I am keeping  us from falling back into bad habits and keeping  us from overspending.

I am interested in how others handle the  logistics  of their  CC use, tracking, and such? Am I over complicating things?

Please keep in mind our personal finance track  record has been abysmal and we are 38 and only started making better decisions 3 years ago since filing for BK.

In 2012 I bought a house with the intent to live in it until I could scrape together enough cash to purchase another house and rent the existing one out.  Earlier this year that plan came together (nicely if I might add) and I was able to rent it out for $400/mo more than the mortgage/taxes/insurance on a one year lease.  The real estate market has gone a little wild in the two years that I've owned that house and it has appreciated by about $80K.



I moved into the new house (summer 2014) and am currently fixing it up.  I estimate it'll take about two years (like the last house) to finish fixing it up and to save enough for another down payment.  It would be reasonable to rent this one for about $200/mo more than the current payment but we'll see what the housing market is like when the time comes.



My plan is to continue buying homes with the intent to live in them for at minimum 1 year (so that I can get a lower interest rate) and then buy a new one and rent the old one.  



I have ~11k in my ROTH IRA which has performed reasonably well.  I have stopped contributing for now in favor of acquiring homes at a greater rate.  If the housing market picks up too much I'll rebalance by contributing the max to my ROTH again.



Current base salary is $50k plus bonuses.  That will be increasing significantly in the coming years but I will continue to spend as though my salary is ~35k.  I also own 33% of the business.  We make distributions to cover our K1s when the time comes.



I am still working towards my degree and paying for it as I go.  I'm taking it slow due to limited time and money but should be done in 2016 at my current burn rate.  This costs about 5k/yr but I do get some relief in my taxes through the education grant.

I've only received one paycheck and am not sure that the tax withholding is where it should be. It's only about 25% of my income and I expected it to be closer to 33%. I will check with HR on Monday.

My minimum monthly expenses:

Expenses | Amount
---|---
Rent + Utilities | ~$950/mo
Health Insurance | $325/mo
Student Loan Payment | $453/mo
Credit Card Payment | ~$170/mo
Transportation | $112/mo
Food | ~$400/mo
**Total Expenses** | **$2,410/mo**

Available cash after taxes and expenses are paid: **$1,150/mo**. This is after bare minimums are met, and I'm not sure that the tax withholding numbers are right, though I'm pretty sure I only claimed 1 exemption on the tax form.

My rent is high compared to most other parts of the country, but this is actually about as cheap as it gets in Lower Manhattan. I could move to Brooklyn, but that would add 20-30 minutes to my commute and I probably still wouldn't find anything less than $800/mo.

Here's the ugly part, my debt:

Federal Loan 1 | 6.55% | $3,680.92
Federal Loan 2 | 5.35% | $2,692.42
Federal Loan 3 | 6.55% | $4,327.94
Federal Loan 4 | 4.25% | $1,645.12
Federal Loan 5 | 6.55% | $5,352.15
Federal Loan 6 | 6.55% | $5,388.30

Name | Rate | Principal balance
---|---|----
Parents Loan | 0% | $1,200

**Total Debt: $47,284.56**

I currently have less than $2000 in my savings account, and no other investments or assets to my name.

So... this looks pretty bad, though I'm sure there are many people who have it a lot worse. I want to pay my parents back immediately. After that, conventional wisdom would be attack in order of the highest interest rate to lowest interest rate, which means start with the credit card debt, then the 5 Federal Loans that are over 5%, then the private loan, then finally the 4.25% Federal Loan.

My parents have offered to pay off my credit card debt in full, then I would pay them back over the course of the next year. Should I do this? They actually have enough money saved to pay back all my debt, and I think I could convince them to do so, but it would be about half their savings so it doesn't seem like a great idea.

Would it make sense to change my student loan repayment plan to an income-driven plan? I would reduce my minimum payment by about $90/mo, and I could use that extra money to pay off my credit card balance.

My new employer offers a Simple IRA than I can contribute to after I earn $5,000 with him, and he will match my contributions up to 3% of my annual income ($1710). I believe I should contribute exactly 3% annually, as its basically free money. Please correct me if I'm wrong, if I should contribute more or less.

I will pay $325/mo for health insurance coverage through my job. Are there more affordable options? I looked at obamacare but I'm way outside the income range for a tax credit, and the cheapest plan I qualify for is $308/mo and has far fewer benefits than the one through my job.

In addition to my job as an architect, I have a deal with my former university that will pay me $12/hr up to $900/yr for some audio production work. I'm going to try to max this out in the next month or two. I can also do some moonlighting on freelance design work, but this can be really difficult with a full-time job already.

This may be a dumb question, but would it make any sense to invest a portion of my income in stocks? Would it be possible to out-earn the interest rate on my loans through wise investments, then cash out a few years from now and pay it towards my loan balance? I'm highly doubtful that that is at all reasonable, but I don't know much about investing.

Do you know of any get-rich-quick schemes? Please direct me to them immediately.

I want to structure my repayment wisely, so any and all advice/suggestions is very much appreciated. Thanks.",finance,1417898593

He was a great friend and friend of our family, he was sharper than a tack and had all the accolades and education to talk circles around anyone in finance.  Luckily he never took or invested my money as he would not allow it, he said he did not want money to ruin a friendship, which is logical as i have seen how money can ruin relationships.

Regardless, the sad part is i met a lot of his clients, he had about 180 clients and a lot of them lost all their money, some over a million dollars.  It was truly hard to believe and shocking to know someone so nice, humble and smart could get away with this.

I also am somewhat nervous about having so much of my net worth in one place, despite being pretty confident that the company will continue to grow. Also afraid of selling and then the company doubling in value a few more times.

Questions:

* On a scale of ""enough to cover my tax bill"" to ""all of it"" how much should I sell near term? Anything beyond what I pay in taxes will go into index funds.
* Is there any way I can hedge what I hold on to? If it were publicly traded I'd probably want a put option, but I doubt think that's possible here.
* Any tips on how to be okay with making the wrong bet?
* It would be stupid to spend most of it on a down payment for a house, right? (Homes in areas I'd want to live start at about $1M)
* Should I actually hire a professional financial adviser? How do I find a good one?
* My new employer doesn't offer a retirement plan. I make too much to contribute to the Roth IRA, and between the low limit and not being tax deductible a Traditional IRA seems pointless. Should I just keep putting money into index funds?",finance,1417929896

* Why is the last percentage 90% and not 100%? 
* Why doesn't the sum of row 32 (Excel row 35) equal the total tax withholding for the entire year?  If you change the 90% to 100%, then obviously these two will be equal.

Research shows this place is worth about $110,00 - $120,000.   In my area, rents are higher than having a mortgage, even after considering PMI, insurance and taxes.  The one issue, of course, would be maintenance.  The only major expense I could foresee would be the A/C quitting.  However, bf has knowledge of A/C repairs and could fix it himself.  

I don't have enough for a conventional loan, but could have the FHA payment in the next few months, before my lease is up, since I have pretty low expenses compared to my income.  

FHA calculator shows that my mortgage payment would be about $850.  After the $140/montly association fee, our housing costs would still be cheaper than what we currently pay.  

Here is a breakdown of my financials: 

* SL debt: $22k @ 4.3%.  IR was 6.8%, but I just refinanced. 

* Car loan: $8.9k @ 3.8%.  Pmt of $390/month 

* Car Insurance: $65/ month  

* Utilities: $200 - $230/month  (I pay all utilities, since I have higher income) 

* CC Debt:  $500 on a 0% interest card, which will go away next month when I pay it off. 

*  healthcare: $140ish/month (pre-tax and comes out of my paycheck) 

*  food/gas/misc exp:  Variable.  I spend a lot of food because I don't eat grains, but I think its worth it.

For the past 3 years, I've been living off credit cards and paying off the balance each month. I had a pretty good credit score of 730, so I decided to apply for a credit card through my bank to get a 0% interest card to make a semi-big purchase. I'm currently using a Discover card with a $1000 limit for monthly purchases and my region's credit card for the big purchase. After the purchase and a few other things, the bank card has a balance of around $800. 


Here's my problem: when I applied for my bank card I asked how long it would be 0% interest for, and I was told 7 months. What I didn't know was the 0% interest was on balance transfers, not purchases, so the balance is starting to gain interest already (at about a 12% rate). I had budgeted being able to pay off the debt in the 7 months, but now that I know it's gaining interest, I'm super stressed and worried. Since I work for my school, I have about 3 weeks where I won't be working at all. So between now and January, I will only earn about $600 dollars, which is enough to pay off my monthly card and some of my regions card, but not enough to make a big dent. I get my student loans and scholarship money in January, and after I pay my rent for the remaining 6 months on my lease I will hopefully have about $800 before books.

So here's my question: What do I do? Do I pay off the discover and live off my bank credit card since it has a lower interest rate? Do I continue to use both and pay back the back one at the rate I was going and take the interest? Will the interest destroy me if I I'm not able to pay it all off in January with the remainder of my scholarship money?

Okay a little bit of a back story, I am a junior in college scheduled to graduate in June 2016. I have been pretty financially responsible, and was able to build my credit up to 750 at the age of 23. Then I made a stupid mistake, I was receiving unemployment benefits during the winter for my seasonal job while also working part time at school. While filing my weekly claims report I didn't claim all of the money I made during spring break. After filing my taxes I get a call from the unemployment office saying I didn't file all of my earnings (I was off by about ~150$), so I would have to repay all of the benefits I recieved over the winter, which was about 1000$. I paid all of that back on my credit card when I got the bill in the mail. It was shitty, but I suppose I did deserve it. Despite paying it right away the tax lien dropped my credit from 750 to 680. 

Okay so fast forward to now, I just transferred to a University from a CC in a different city studying full time. My financial aide gives me about 500 dollars extra a month which is not enough to live on. So I have been staying with my mom since September. Its kind of shitty, I am 24 years old living with my mom and commuting by bus 2 hours a day. But Seattle is expensive so you do what you got to do.

personalfinance,7702 Life Insurance as retirement account: can anyone tell me something bad about it that isn't about how it's marketed in a shady way?,"Hi PF. I've got a friend from work who also works for TransAmerica. I agreed to meet with her with my wife to discuss retirement accounts. I am pretty lacking in knowledge on retirement accounts, but have learned a bit by casually reading here for the past year or so. She went over ALL retirement/savings account options (401ks, IRAs, fixed, indexes, variable, etc) and their expected interest rates and all that jazz. Then she told us a little bit about 7702s and we scheduled another consultation with her 2 weeks later.

At that meeting, she asked to and brought her superior and they both talked to us about life insurance. They were not shady about addressing it as such. They told us flat out that it is a life insurance plan being used as a vehicle to retirement where we can sign up for cheaper plans with low premiums (most likely paying less than $100/mo each; we're both under 25) and contribute however much extra we choose to count as a retirement/investment fund.

I don't see anything wrong with this. I can pay let's say $75/mo for a life insurance plan that I (or I suppose my wife) may one day be glad I had; while also be dumping money (let's say $225) into the same plan/account/whatever I should call it to count towards my retirement. To my understanding, this $225 every month (more and more as our income grows over time) will only contribute to a retirement savings fund that gains anywhere from 5-10% interest, is easily liquid before retirement if needed without fees, and is facing little risk to catch enormous tax breaks.

In my research to find anything bad about TransAmerica or life insurance plans as retirement accounts, all I have found are people saying they don't like the phrasing of a 7702 as a 'plan' because it's misleading/shady and/or that they pay way too high of a premium to benefit. I don't feel like I'm suffering any of these two problems by signing up. I know it's life insurance, and as far as I know I'll be paying less than $100/mo every year forever (not sure about that - can't remember if she said premiums increase or not but I feel she said they wouldn't) and contributing as much as I want/can to a ""retirement account in hiding"" that gets a way better interest rate and tax break than anything else I've read about. I just don't see the downside other than this trend of buying 7702s as retirement started off being misrepresented and sold by shady people just trying to get the most bang for their buck.

  **A**. Pay off current debt with current card and eat the interest rate.

personalfinance,Student Loan/Advice--&gt;$110K Debt,"Hello everyone, So I am not-so recent college graduate and face a whopping $100K of student loan debt ($110 including my new car). To be honest, I had no idea I owed that much until a massive bill smacked me right across the face. But, despite the frustration I finally got over it and now look to set up the best strategy to pay off this loan. My main goal is 1) pay it off as soon as possible 2) In a way that minimizes interest. So with that being said this is the situation that I am in and what exactly I owe: 


Creditor----&gt;	             Balance($)---&gt;	 Rate	---&gt;          Base Payment

**NOTE**: *Sub= Subsidized  *Unsub=Unsubsidized 

The ""Great Lakes"" creditor has the highest interest rate with a massive $559.43 base payment per month. This one is tough to tackle and I need to be careful. What do you guys suggest I plan my strategy around?

My current strategy is to:
Allocate a higher portion of money per month to the highest interest rate loan first (Great Lakes) and proceed to the second highest, and so on. I also plan to pay off loans TWICE a month as opposed to only once-in efforts to further minimize my compounding interest. I make 40K a year and am planning to set aside 50% of my monthly income every month for loan payments. 

This is my first time dealing with such a thing (student loans), yet I feel as if I have a good plan in place.

investing,Loan growth vs. Deposit Growth in the US banking system and what if anything is it telling us....,"I have been following this [chart](http://imgur.com/T53QKUb) for a while and I wanted to see if anyone thought it had any meaningful implications.  It draws weekly data from the Federal Reserve's Commercial bank report and it shows the Year over Year growth in loans and deposits for the banking system.  

A couple observations from history:

1) Going into recessions, loan growth outpaces deposit growth as sentiment peaks and willingness to borrow is highest 

2) Coming out of recessions, deposit growth outpaces loan growth as willingness to borrow is low and focus is on deleveraging 

You can see in this cycle, the difference between deposit growth and loan growth has been significant and is only now turning.  

Obviously, QE has pushed up deposit growth over the past few years but I wonder now that QE is over what if anything this chart is telling us.  

Many consider traditional monetary velocity metric as useless given the Fed intervention so is this of any use ? 

I believe a recovery in credit demand is an important part of a robust recovery but so far it has been lacking outside of the public sector and pockets of the household sector (e.g. student loans).  A willingness to borrow by the private sector demonstrates confidence so I watch credit metrics closely as a gauge of broad and sector specific sentiment.

personalfinance,"~$230,000 Student Loan Payoff Strategy Advice","Hello PF,

I feel like I have figured out a good (albeit morbid) strategy for taking care of the student loans my parents took out for my undergrad, and I'd love a second opinion.

Background: ~$230,000 of loans completely in my father's name, 1 Federal loan 40K @5%, 4 Sallie Mae loans 190K @ 8%. Basically, right when I was applying, my father got an executive position at a company, and right after I finished school, he was laid off, so we got screwed on financial aid, and he had the loans in forbearance for the past year, accruing interest. Once in repayment, the estimated payments were going to be ~$2500/month over 15 years. My father is officially unemployed, and at 67, he is gearing up for retirement.

The plan: Doing my research, I found that there are no income-based repayment plans for the Parent-Plus loans, so it was looking like we might actually be stuck with that crazy monthly bill. After more research, I found out that we could consolidate all of the loans into a Direct Consolidated Loan, which would be eligible for income-based repayment. He was approved, and I am set to begin payments of $550/month. The monthly payment will change each year depending on his income and will likely increase once he starts receiving SS, which he is delaying for the maximum payout. But just assuming $550 for easy math's sake, the total we would pay over the course of the loan is $550 x 12 x 25 = $165,000. The average monthly payment over the 25 years of the loan would have to be $766 for me to end up paying the full balance, but based on the income calculation he would have to make over $70,000 to warrant those monthly payments...

Now, the kicker: at 25 years, any leftover balance is forgiven, but it is taxed as income. The remaining balance on the loan at 25 years would be something like $400,000, so let's say we'd owe $150,000 in tax. But, I would have 25 years to save that sum, just in case, which looks like $500/month, when I'm already saving about $3000 a month, so pretty doable. On the other hand, if my father dies before the loan period ends (he would be 92), the rest of the loan is forgiven, without consequence. I am obviously not wishing that my father will die before his time, but given my family's dicey financial situation, I am trying to be practical as well.

Is there anything that I am not considering that could undermine this plan? Or is there another approach that would be more advantageous?


---- EDIT ----

Thank you to everyone who has replied! There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding in the comments: I do not expect my parents to pay ANY of the loans. I am paying them myself. I am simply outlining a strategy for minimizing the amount that I would need to pay back. I understand that what I am proposing is essentially PF heresy.

It was for a phone through Pac-Bell, which to my understanding, has long since been bankrupted or bought out. Another possible myth I've heard growing up is that some debts vanish or are exempt after 7 years. I'm 26 now, so it should be gone now, if it's true. I guess my question is is this debt possibly still affecting me? And what would be the best way to go to start building credit?

I've got about 70k left on a 30 year variable APR mortgage that I'm 10 years into. The house is worth much more than that (~200K.)

I got the loan in the middle of the sub-prime mess at 18 years of age with no credit and no job, so it's not a great one but it's changed over the many bank changes it's been through. My current APR is 4.25 and in the life of the loan it's never gone over 5.8 (except for the predatory ""deferred minimum payment"" we won't talk about.) 

I wanted to refinance into something that could lock the interest rate in at something low, and not get blasted as the rates come up. However, since I'm so far into the amortization schedule, it looks like getting a new loan will cost more, even if rates inch up some (due to closing and resetting amortization.) Is this right? 

I've got good credit now, but I'm concerned given the size of the loan relative to closing costs and the relatively small amount I'm paying to interest monthly, it might not make sense to refinance.

I have not received my financial aid information for my senior year yet, but I expect it to cover the ~1200/mo rent for all academic year months (September - May). I am responsible for the months that the school year does not cover (in addition to other expenses associated with living off campus, like heating/internet/electricity).

I have a few thousand out in federal loans, but I never have had to take out loans from banks to pay for school yet. I was hoping /r/personalfinance could give me some tips/where it's best to start looking. I go to school in D.C.

Thanks",finance,1418065583
personalfinance,401(k) Loan with Zero Investment Risk,"This is a really wonky strategy with a 401(k) loan that I have personally used eliminate the investment gain risk, but I hesitate to describe it because it's so easy to screw up...oh, screw it, here you go.  Just be careful and make sure you fully understand this before trying it at home.  Here goes:

We all know that withdrawing money from your 401(k) for non-retirement purposes is a bad idea.  Don't do it.  Even if you can find one of the exceptions that let's you do it without penalty, you're giving up tax-free growth and investment gains.  Instead of withdrawing, there are 401(k) loans, which you repay with interest (which goes to you).  This is a *slightly* better option, since in theory once you pay the loan back into the account it can start appreciating again in value.  The downsides are that if you leave your job (whether by choice or layoff), you have a very limited window to repay the entire loan balance, or the IRS will declare it a withdrawal, in which case you'll have to pay taxes and penalties on the amount left on the loan.  Also, you lose out on any growth you would have made during the time you're repaying the loan.  Obviously, your risk of changing jobs is what it is, and you can't do anything about that.  If you're comfortable with your job security for the period it will take you to repay the loan, and want to eliminate the investment risk, read on.

Consider that you have some kind of asset allocation for your 401k.  It could be an 80/20 stock/bond split, 90/10, or whatever fits your current risk level.  Let's say it's 80/20, and you have $100k in the account.  You get a loan for $20k, and repay it with an interest rate that's about equal to what bonds would have returned.  If you don't change your asset allocation, now you effectively have $20000 + (.2*80000) = $36000 invested in bond-like assets, or 36% of your $100k balance.  This will screw with your long-term returns, and is what I mean when I say the investment risk of a 401(k) loan.

But, you have the freedom to adjust your asset allocation!  Just shift to 100% stocks, and now you have $80k in stocks, and $20k in bond-like assets in your 401k.  Your original asset allocation is completely preserved, and you have entirely eliminated the investment risk of a 401k loan.  As you repay the loan, periodically re-balance, keeping in mind that your outstanding loan amount counts as a conservative bond investment.

Obviously, this isn't ideal.  You still have the aforementioned job risk, and you're reducing your cash flow.  But life isn't always ideal.  Sometimes you really need to move, or find a house that perfectly fits your long term goals and easily fits within your budget, but need to quickly secure a down-payment.  This is one way to do that.",finance,1418066421
personalfinance,Law school is evil! and I'm just plain stupid.,"Thank you for your help in advance. I’m in a difficult student loan position and I am unsure how to proceed. I was a first generation college student who didn’t know that going to law school was a stupid, stupid economic decision. I had no undergraduate debt but have approximately $200,000 in public loans from law school. I make $55,000 per year. My husband makes $50,000 per year and has $60,000 in private and public loans. My loans have been consolidated so that my grad plus loans would be eligible for income based repayment. We have been actively paying down my husband’s private loans that have very high interest rates and have been living as frugally as possible to make this happen.
I’m at a loss when it comes to my loans. We can’t afford the interest accumulating on the loans, let alone make any substantial dent on the principal. It’s also very likely that will remain the case over my lifetime, as I don’t expect a huge bump in salary, nor does he. Ideally, I’d love to work in the public sector (that’s why I went to law school) but I’m having a difficult time finding any job, let alone one doing public interest work. If that were the case, I’d have 10-year forgiveness and the forgiveness wouldn’t be taxable. As it stands, I’m working in the private sector, and will have to claim any amount forgiven after 20 years as income, which will be at least a $100k tax bill when it comes due. 
What do I do? I’d sell my soul if it would get me anywhere. I want to be able to pay my loans back in full, but that will never happen. From what I understand, I can file form 982 when the time comes and reduce my tax liability due to my insolvency. 
Do I live the next 20 years hoping that the tax code doesn’t become even more burdensome to idiots like me and making sure that the assets we accumulate are my husband’s only? How do I plan for my future when it looks so bleak?",finance,1418067908

personalfinance,What is the best way to transfer an auto loan in anticipation of selling the car?,"Hi PF, so I have a little situation that I have been trying to figure out for about a month now and I thought I'd ask for some advice before making a decision. Due to a somewhat unique set of circumstances I need to sell my car well before I had originally anticipated. As a result, I still owe $8700 to the bank. I plan to sell the car for about $20k, however, I have found it quite difficult to do so without title in hand. I've already had two interested parties that I believe bailed because of the more involved process associated with doing the title transfer through the bank (I should note that the lending institution does not have a nearby branch that we could visit together). That being said, I've decided to try to pay off the loan to make the sale as smooth as possible for potential buyers.

My auto loan is a fairly low 3.9% and is currently the only debt that I have. I also have a pretty decent credit score (Discover's FICO score says I'm in the 740's, Credit Karma says it's in the 760's). I really wanted to transfer the auto loan to a Chase Sapphire card to take advantage of the 0% transfer fee and 0% APR for 15 months, however, after visiting the branch, I was informed that Chase does not allow the transfer of auto loans to credit cards. Ultimately, I just need to move the car loan to some other loan vehicle so that I could have the title sent to me to complete the sale. I would expect to sell the car within 2 months or so, so it is okay if my interest rate increased a little bit as long as I could pay the loan/credit card off early. I could also adjust my budget to pay the car off in a year if I had to. My worse case scenario is paying the car off with my emergency fund or short term investments, which I really do not want to do if it can be helped.

  I guess my question is whether anyone is aware of a credit card that I could transfer the auto loan to for the short term. Low transfer fees and interest are obviously ideal, but I would expect to pay off the principle fairly quickly so some increase is fine. If there are no cards out there, how about an unsecured loan or some instrument I'm not thinking of. I'd appreciate any advice or experience on the issue as Google does not seem to have a clear cut answer apart from doing a bank transfer with the buyer. Thanks!",finance,1418072812
personalfinance,CD maturing soon and not sure what to do,"I've read the FAQ, but I'm still not sure what to do in this situation.

I have a CD with about $80,000 in it that will be maturing soon (I've had it for a long time...opened it back when interest rates were still decent). I don't know what to do with the money. I have an emergency fund, I contribute the yearly max to my Rorth IRA, and I don't have any big purchases (like a house or car) on the horizon. I am debt free. I can't put it into my 401K because it's post-tax income.

I have been and will continue to be putting about $500 a month toward this savings. Besides renewing the CD (current rate is only about 2.5% APY), is my only other option to invest it in stocks/bonds? I am a little reluctant to do this because a) it's the majority of my net worth and I'm very risk-averse, and b) the tax implications. Should I maybe keep some of it in a CD and invest only a portion?",finance,1418073794
personalfinance,Last major stop towards financial freedom,"I'm in my early 30's and made plenty of dumb choices earlier in my life that I have been fixing. I once read a post somewhere about how you want to always be helping your future-self with decisions you make in the present. With that mind set, I have overcome quite a few financial roadblocks over the years.

I started my lovely life with a caring but rather monetarily disadvantaged family. I had to get my first apartment at 19, paid my way through school, and purchased things on credit cards assuming this would all get paid off in the near future. A couple of years before I hit 30 I started resolving all of this with the pending doom of adulthood finally setting into my mind. From then until now I was able to pay off my student loans and some other major credit card debt I incurred. I had the mindset that it was better to pay off these 20%+ interest rates when I had a below-600 credit score just to be in better shape in the future. I could invest once I had a manageable (and acceptable debt).

Now I currently have 15k in total debt along with my mortgage. My credit score is now at 710-730 (depending what company it is referenced at) so I am looking into using Prosper to borrow cash and payoff the majority of credit card debt that has a very high interest rate. I have also shifted my spending to my American Express so that I no longer have the habit of leaving purchases on a credit card and instead pay it off every month. With this, I am looking at paying $450 per month for the next 36 months in order to pay off this remaining 15k.

I also currently make 112k salary in a job that I really love so although it has not been an easy road, it has seemed worth it. Are there other things I should be looking at now at this point? I currently set 6% of my salary for 401k due to company matching benefits and have gone through all of my accounts to cancel anything I deem unnecessary (in terms of reocurring fees).

Bitcoin,Beware of anti-bitcoin sentiments; lost job due to bitcoin hating boss,"Until recently I worked as an IT admin at a medium sized insurance firm in the midwest with seven locations.  The firm offers a range of products and also has a dedicated financial products salesman.  

Recently I was doing some on-site maintenance on a server and adding a new ip phone at a branch office.  While I was setting up the phone at a receptionists desk I happened to get into a conversation with a customer that was waiting for a meeting with the financial products guy.

Of course I mentioned during the conversation that I was into bitcoin but didn't push the topic.  The customer asked me a bunch of questions about bitcoin and I told him about satoshi and how the federal reserve prints money and how inflation is destroying the dollar.  I really wasn't pushing it, just rattling off a few comments while I punched in the phone settings.  We also talked about college football and other normal stuff.  I was just trying to be friendly.

The next day a company VP at the main office asked me why I was giving financial advice to ""our clients"".  I was taken aback and asked what he was talking about.  He said the financial products guy met with a client that was supposed to invest six figures in a fund but got cold feet after I spoke to him.

I explained the brief conversation I had with someone in the lobby but told him it was just about football and bitcoin.  Right away he got really flustered and said that bitcoin was a scam and only dumb financially illiterate people buy it.  I told him, as calmly as I could, that this wasn't the case and many successful CEOs own bitcoin.  I also volunteered to show him some Andreas videos to help educate him on bitcoin.  He just walked away from me mid-sentence.

Well last Friday which was four days after this conversation, I got fired.  No explanation was given at all although I did get three months severance pay (I'll probably invest this in bitcoin as payback).

The only reason I can think I got fired is because I'm into bitcoin and my bosses didn't understand it.  It's really frustrating to understand something as complicated as bitcoin but be unable to share this knowledge with others.  So many people hate bitcoin without even trying to understand it.  I honestly don't understand why people go out of their way to suppress bitcoin.  I never bought into all of the conspiracy stuff but now I'm starting to think the existing financial system is beginning to fight back.

This is a throwaway and I won't claim any tips.  I have some job leads and will come out fine if not better from this experience.  I just wanted to share my story as a warning to others that not everyone has an open mind when it comes to bitcoin.  There is still a lot of progress that needs to be made on the education front.

*****
**Edit: Just checked this post and noticed a lot of comments about me giving improper financial advice.  In case it wasn't obvious above, I'm not a financial person I did IT work for this company.  I told the client that I did IT and there shouldn't have been any confusion that I was a financial planner or anything.**

**Also, some people thought this was a huge client for the firm.  I called a friend of mine back at the office and she told me that even though it was a six figure investment, the firm would have only made a single-digit percentage commission.**

**After reading some of the comments I still don't think I did anything wrong.  I think the company overracted and wrongly assumed this client backed away due to bitcoin.  Thanks to those of you that gave some positive feedback and advice.**",cryptocurrency,1418075165
personalfinance,Student Loan Nightmare!,"My original post was here.  With the back story.https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lk766/tifu_by_going_to_law_school/

I just discovered that when you use income based repayment, at the end of the 25 years and the debt is forgiven, it becomes taxable income. Using the federal student loan website, the future forgiven amount of my current 205,000 in student loans would be over $500,000 dollars!!! The taxable amount on that using today's rates and calculator from the IRS website would be over $150,000. 

I literally will make $13,000 this year, after spending most of the year unemployed. To realistically pay the debt off in 25 years I would have to have an income in the $70,000 a year range with payments around $18000 a year. Based on the federal student loan repayment calculator. My bill under income based repayment will be zero up to $43,000 a year, and then 15% of every dollar earned beyond that.",finance,1418075557

technology,"If ISPs are reclassified as Telecommunication Services (Title II), what will the effects be? Why should I support or oppose it?","I support Net Neutrality. I support data being treated equally. I opposes paid prioritization. I oppose throttling and blocking.

**But why should I support Title II? What are the regulations behind it and will they all apply? Would they be able to regulate price and is that a good or bad thing? What will it actually do to the market? Does it make them utilities and what does that really mean? Should the distribution of a high-tech service like the internet really be considered the same as the distribution of water or electricity?  Will the federal “Universal Service Fund” fee (16.1%) be applied? What about state and local taxes? Does it even ensure no paid prioritization? What other consequences could come from its implementation?**
   
I’m trying to get a better idea of what it will actually do as my current understanding has me seeing positives and negatives.

Title II may be good because a market made up of networks makes it seems like it might be impossible for competition to survive. ISPs can compete, but as soon as one starts to gain more of the market they have a much easier time in growing that market even farther while driving out competition. (See http://www.jamesjheaney.com/2014/09/15/why-free-marketeers-want-to-regulate-the-internet/ for what I mean. Skip to the section “Natural Monopolies: Everything Is Upside Down” and read from there). 

Title II may be bad because it could cause added regulation and fees making it even harder for competition to join the marketplace. So these ISPs would most likely still be “monopolies”, but just be government enforced monopolies. And that has some downsides. They would rely on best estimates for setting market prices, instead of the market deciding (it would probably be better than what we have now, but still not ideal). They can be complacent and fail to innovate quickly or at all. And the service would most likely still not live up to our expectations. So a reclassification of Title II wouldn't even address many of the issues that we seem to have.

**Are there other ways of implement Net Neutrality rules without reclassification? Are there other solutions that we should be considering? Possibly the removal of regulation and increased Municipal Broadband? Why or why not?** 

Please add your input. Let me know if I’m misinformed on something. I would greatly appreciate comments from people that have actually read into the law. But please don’t let that stop you from adding whatever you want to the conversation.",technology,1418075772
personalfinance,Looking for brief advice on Credit vs Student debt,"Hello PF.  First let me say that I have checked the FAQ and although this is partially covered, my question is slightly more unique (whose isn't?) so bear with me.  Additionally I'm not looking for budgeting advice, just debt-paying advice.
I've made up an annual/per-paycheck budget for 2015 and fairly detailed approximations for where I'll be at the 2, 6 and 12 month marks.  Why those numbers?  Well I have college refund checks coming in at weeks 2 and 6, respectively.  Initially the plan was to use the avalanche method and take out more low-interest student debt to pay off high-interest credit cards, but now I don't know.  I ran two different possibilities.

* **Consolidation plan:** The idea here is distributing the loans to credit cards as planned will leave me with 0 credit card debt after 6 months, at which point I expect to be able to get around another $7500 in credit lines.  After 12 months, I'll have all but my one main loan paid down, and left with a $33,000 lump sum.

&gt;This plan has all credit cards paid off and limits increased, but $33,000 left to pay off.

* **Return/Snowball Plan:** Even at 20% interest vs 5%, my student loans are large enough that they will still cost me more money each month in interest than my credit cards.  They will, in fact, up until the very end of the year.  Financially I could maximize my savings in interest by putting the loan money back into the loan it came out of, and paying down this largest loan up front.

&gt;This plan has all credit cards left at an average usage of 80-85% for a full year and may damage my credit rating.  Including interest, this plan leaves me with $5000 less debt at $28000

**Ultimately I'm confused on what the financial value of a credit score/line is.**  Is saving $5000 in a year worth screwing over my limited credit history for a full year?  Is that extra credit line and higher score more valuable if I want to consolidate my loans or have them reevaluated at a lower interest rate?",finance,1418076438

Total Current Loan Balance: $137,990.15 (ouch)

I have yet to exit the grace period on my loans and am currently looking to consolidate to a long repayment period, and low interest rate. I know this is a dangerous move as a longer repayment period generally yields in more interest paid, but I intend to be making atleast double/triple payments every time, which in return will get the loan paid off much quicker than intended. I am currently shopping around to see who can give me the lowest interest rate

Doing some simple math:

Monthly Take home income:   $2882.28

(Rent/Utilities):                          -$850.00

(Groceries):                                -$350.00

(Gas):                                          -$50.00

(Entertainment):                        -$300.00

---------------------------------------------------------------

Remaining Net Balance:           $1332.28

I am lucky enough to have some great parents that have set some money aside to help pay for my student loans, and they are willing to pay up to $500/month to help me out. I am a little reluctant to accept such a high payment because I want to become financially independent as they have done more than enough for me throughout my life! 

So with that information, that leaves me with $1332.28 left over per month. Up until now, I have been taking $1,000 out of every paycheck and putting it into a savings account. The only time I touch this account is to pay my rent every month. Currently in this account I have $5,126.17. This is basically my emergency fund that I am building up before student loans start to kick in. Right now, I am currently budgeting about $1,000/month of my own money to go towards my loans. This leaves me with $332.28 left to use as savings. Of that $332.28, I want to use $100.00 and play the stock market a bit. I am willing to lose that $100.00/month in the market.

All in all, I know I do not have the consolidated loan rate, and have not found out my monthly payments for my loans, but was wondering /r/personalfinance opinions on my budgeting. Any and all help/opinions/tips are much appreciated! Just a 23 y/o mechanical engineer trying to make a game plan as far as student loans go!

TL:DR- Am I putting enough money towards monthly payments of student loans according to the information provided above?!

personalfinance,Large amount of restitution- how do I go about paying this off?,"Hi everyone,

I currently have a balance of $38,908.26 on restitution owed from a car accident I had when I was a teenager. It has been 7 years since the accident and I have not made much of a dent in the balance. The sentenced amount was around 28k, but since then I have accrued almost 16k in interest. I believe the interest is a 1% of the balance monthly. 

I am kind of at a loss as to what to do to pay this off. I think I should man up and pay $1000/month and reign in my spending a bit.

financialindependence,Just started modeling my FI and I have a few questions and thoughts.,"I'm 31, have been saving semi-heavily (30-50%) for about 3 years and have just start to model what I need to do recently.  I have a few questions/thoughts that I was hoping people could weigh in on:

* My wife and I currently spend about 45k a year on everything when you get rid of debt.  We live a very comfortable lifestyle IMO.  If I calculate that out by the 4% rule, that means we would need ~1.1M in savings to keep the same lifestyle.  However, those are in todays dollars.  Am I safe to assume that I should calculate that final number based on the value of the dollar at the time?  What is the rate of inflation people use (I currently have 3.22% in my models)?

* I know a lot of people talk about the value of investing over paying off a house.  In my models, I will actually get to FI a few years earlier by paying off my mortgage despite the fact that it is only a 3.5% interest rate.  This is because I will then be able to save an additional $1,300 per month that was previously being used for principle.  I also find that psychologically, I feel much more financially secure when I am completely debt free in a few years.  Thoughts?

* How do people factor things in like Social Security.  I plan on retiring long before I hit the point where I can withdraw my SS.  Do you just look at it as icing on the cake or are people looking to do a slightly larger draw-down in the years before and then have everything boosted by SS and go back to 4%?

Any thoughts or comments are very welcome.  Thanks!

personalfinance,Consolidation Loan for Credit Cards?,"Posting from a throwaway because frankly, this stuff is embarrassing. My wife and I have a fair pile of debt between credit cards, student loans, and medical bills.

We’re not big credit users in general. Out of college, we were doing very well with paying our balances in full every month, and just building credit.

Things kind of hit the fan in a lot of ways in 2010 and onward. Between a lot of unemployment and under-employment for both of us, plus various family medical issues, our own medical issues, etc, we just didn’t have enough income and wound up having to use a lot of credit for living expenses and other emergencies.

Things hit their peak last year and have been slowly getting better over the majority of 2014. We’re both now employed full-time and have been doing what we can to get back on top of our finances.  We moved in the spring of 2013 to a different state and reduced our rent by $400 per month and brought down our other living expenses as well.

We have one car payment of $250 per month, which will be gone in about 5 months.  That car was an unexpected expense in early 2010 when someone ran a red light and totaled our car. I needed a decent used car ASAP and wound up with a Corolla, which is still holding up great.

I have no student loans, and the brunt of my wife’s loans are being covered by her parents.

The big tamale is nearly $15,000 of credit card debt, spread across 6 accounts. I’m at about 88% utilization of my available credit.  Interest rates on the cards range from 13% to 28%.  We really have not added anything new to the credit cards in the past year+, but just staying on top of the payments and interest seems like an unclimbable mountain sometimes.

Minimum payments combined on the car and credit cards come to about $700 per month.  I pay as much over the minimums each month as possible, but sometimes it’s only an extra $5 to $20 per account.

Naturally once the car is fully paid off in the spring, I’ll be using that $250 per month towards the other debt.

My big question is regarding debt consolidation. I feel like getting a consolidation loan for at least the credit cards would be a big help, but I want to make sure I’m not overlooking any major details.

My wife recently found employment with the state, so we quickly made moves to switch from Bank of America over to our State Employee Credit Union. I’m guessing they will be the best place to investigate a consolidation loan.

As far as I understand it, the consolidation loan would be used to pay off all the credit balances, and then we’d just make one lump payment on that loan each month, at a MUCH lower interest rate than the credit cards are currently getting.

When I go into the credit union to ask about the loan, what other questions should I have for them?  Should I be looking to just do a consolidation loan for the credit cards themselves, or should the car and other things be included too?

Thanks in advance for your advice and feedback.  It feels really daunting right now, but I’ve seen some of the other success stories in PF, and I know that with the right discipline we can become debt-free in less time than we probably think.

TL:DR - Have nearly $15k in credit card debt, with high interest rates. Is a consolidation loan the best course of action to get on top of it all?",finance,1418149208
personalfinance,Is there such a thing as a 10 year fixed VA mortgage?,"My wife and I are looking for houses and we've been quoted some preliminary interest rates of 3.05% 15 year fixed.  We have great credit and good income and the VA guarantee certainly helps.  We're looking in the $250k range and we only really need to put 5% down in order to reduce the VA funding fee.  We're going to be here for a long time so I'm not really worried about potentially being underwater with such a small down payment.  

Anyway, I've asked several people including a real estate agent but I've not received much information on 10 year fixed VA loans.  Is it a thing?  I would prefer to get the P&amp;I out of the way as soon as possible, save some money on interest, and move the mortgage funds into long term investing instead.  If it is a thing, what are the interest rates like compared to a 15 year?

Assume we can afford either loan with no problem.

Some back of the envelope calculations I did...

* Assuming same interest rate of 3.05% we would save ~$21,000 with a 10 year instead of a 15 year.  Not including opportunity cost of a 15 year due to 5 years of not investing the P&amp;I.  Big advantage for a 10 year.
* I calculate that any interest rate on a 10 year below ~4.50% would have a net reduction in total interest paid.  Again, not including the opportunity cost.
* I calculate the 5 year opportunity cost of the 15 year loan at ~$129,000 @ 6% ROI.
* I calculate that, including the opportunity cost of the 15 year loan, any 10 year loan with an interest rate below 9% would be a net financial gain.

If my calculations above are correct I'm not sure there is any scenario, VA guaranteed or not, that we should go with a 15 year loan.  My hope is that there is such a thing as a 10 year VA loan because that seems to maximize financial gain to the tune of ~$150,000 over 15 years.  That's not chump change.

Anyone have any advice or thoughts?  Sorry for rambling...",finance,1418149522

What do I base this one so I can figure out how much i need to withdraw.

Before I realized the contribution rule, I already have a total of $1600 contributed into my account. Currently it's worth $1595. Do I simply withdraw (sell) $200 and I will be fine? Or is it more complicated than that? 

I am a college student, no job right now. The $1400 I made in 2014 was from a part time customer service job. I'm just confused if I can contribute up to what I made in gross income, or if it's net income. I don't wanna have any penalties or issues with my IRA come next April.

Credit Card Debt:
$3,900 at 0% until Oct 2015
$1,300 at 15%
$2,000 at 23%
$600 at 22%

Student Loan:
Federal unsubsidized with ""nelnet"" currently $10,050 at 8%
It is on a ""pay as you earn"" plan. Therefore since my taxes showed an earning of $5,000 last year I will not being paying until August of 2015. This coming tax year I will be closer to $14,000 in earnings.

I plan on working in the public service/ government sector ( policing, corrections, etc) so there's always the chance after 20 years this will be forgiven. But for such a small (school) loan I would rather pay it off and forget about it.

Money I do have:
I always keep a mere $100 in checking for emergencies, and my savings has sat at $20 for over a year since I've been low income and trying to pay off debt.

$360 that has been owed by a friend for over a year will be coming friday( about damn time!)
$500 between both parents as gifts expected for Christmas.
$400 in federal/state tax return

Then there is a possibility of $10,000 coming my way.
It is an inheritance left by my grandma that my dad has had control over. Both my brothers had theirs years ago, but my father has held on to mine because of my terrible spending habits. I spoke with him at thanksgiving about it but did not push the subject. He never let on that he would or would not give it to me.

I work full time as support staff at a public high school. This affords me awesome hours, but little pay.
After taxes are taken out I earn about $1,100 a month. About $400 of that is spent on gas and food, and a small amount of fun each month. I have no other bills at this point.

I have a BS degree and am continually looking for better work, but as of right now it looks like I will need to pick up a second job.

Now besides the mountain of debt I have, I really need to move out of my mothers house. She is and always has been verbally abusive towards me. I can not escape to my fathers like I did in HS because he lives 4 states away now. My boyfriend and I plan on trying to move out of our respective parents homes by middle of next year.

What is the best plan of action for myself to tackle this debt so I can start my life?

If I do receive the 10k:
Is it best to pay off all cards and put the remaining to the student loan? 
Or would it be better to pay off the cards, but hide the ~2k in savings for emergencies and repairs for my high milage car?


If I do not receive said inheritance money, what is best to do with such high credit card debt? Ive been tempted to open a personal loan at around 8%, but ive read that those are not always the best idea, I'd rather pay them off in the snowball method.

As for moving out, between the both of us we are pretty set up for furnishing. We only need a handful of kitchen tools and a security deposit to be good to go.

personalfinance,How to get a car as a college student?,"I'm currently a sophomore living on campus at a large state school in New York. I was planning on renting a cheap house near campus next year with some friends, which would save my family loads of money compared to living on campus. To do this, however, I'd need a car to get to and from school and work. I made $2000 last summer working 40 hours a week which I was going to save for a car and expenses in college, but between having to buy books and a surprise tuition payment I had to take care of myself (my family isn't exactly well-off financially), my accounts were essentially depleted. I plan on working during winter break, but I have a feeling I'll only make enough to pay for christmas gifts and books for next semester!

I've wanted my own car ever since highschool. I hate having to rely on other people for rides to a friends house, the store, or work. I hate not being able to treat a pretty lady to a nice night out. I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm venting (I kinda am), but it feels like I'm caught in this inescapable vicious circle where I'm constantly working but gaining nothing from it!! 

**I'm wondering if anyone here at /r/personalfinance has any tips or advice on how to escape this and start saving money for a car? I'm looking for articles or books to read, personal success stories, anything!**

I've thought about getting a loan for a cheap econobox, but as far as I know I have no credit, so I'm sure I'd get boned with interest rates and what not. Also, I wouldn't feel comfortable having my parents cosign for anything, because I've recently began to distrust their financial decision making. 

If you all need any extra information, I'd be happy to oblige.

personalfinance,Should I take out subsidized student loans to pay back my unsubsidized/ higher interest rate?,"Hi everyone.

I'm about to graduate college in 2 weeks. For my first two years of college, I didn't really understand the concept of loans. I just took out max loans and spent the money. By my third year, my financial aid dropped significantly. I realized I was forced to take out even more loans with worst interest rates. I vowed from that point forward I wouldn't take out any loans. I started working.

I've been lucky to be offered subsidized loans at lower interest rates this semester. I was planning on taking out my maximum loan amount and paying back all my high interest/ unsubsidized loans before graduation?

I currently have about 21k in loans and about 4,000 saved. I should receive probably about $1000-$2000 when I get my tax refund later in the year. I am unemployed, but my last internship paid me $25 an hour. I'll be moving home when I look for a job.

Is there a specific order to which I should pay these off (They each have different interest rates as well, I was thinking of doing highest interest rate first to lowest)

Also - how much time do you think it would be before I actually have to start paying, I will start paying now, but just wondering how far ahead of the game I can get without interest etc.",finance,1418167504
personalfinance,College won't disburse financial aid and I don't know what to do.,"Alright, so this is going to be a bit of a long post, so bear with me.  My freshman year of college was pretty rough, and I ended up failing to reach a 2.0 GPA, which is required to receive financial aid.  Being that my family is dirt poor, I am completely dependent on federal aid to pay for my schooling, and I had to take a semester off.  Now, my school allows each student one appeal to get financial aid back, which I filed and won on the condition that I would get my GPA above a 2.0 within a year, which I did. 

Since my freshman spring semester, I have been a member of a fraternity on campus- actually, the only one on campus.  Now before anyone goes judging me based on that, it isn't an animal house type of frat, it's more like a bunch of nerds who have their own house.  I have paid my dues out of pocket with summer jobs, and my grades have steadily increased since I joined, because I want to be able to hold a leadership position at some point.  

At the end of last spring, I was sitting at a 2.2 GPA, needing a 2.5 to get the position I wanted, so I ran the numbers and decided that if I took two summer classes, one new class and retake English 102, and if I got an A in both, I would finish the summer with a 2.51.  It would cost a little bit more, but I had a job and I was able to pay for the classes.  I passed the first class with an A, but I was never able to get better than a mid B on any of my assignments for English.  Call it I didn't work hard enough, the teacher was too tough, I don't know.  All I know is it didn't work out.  After having pushed for 18 months toward this one goal, all of my work seemed like it was for nothing.  I got more than a little depressed over it, and decided to quit going to class.  It was past the withdrawal date when I realized I wasn't getting the grade I wanted, and the school takes the higher grade when you retake a class, so I figured that failing out would have no effect on me.  I could not have been more wrong, but it took half way through the semester for me to figure it out.

Fast forward to Fall '14.  I registered for classes, had my FAFSA completed and everything, but this time I got selected for verification.  I had been selected the year before, but the school chose to go through KHEAA instead of dealing with it themselves, and it took a lot longer to process than the year prior.  In fact, 5 weeks into the semester, I still had not been notified of my financial aid situation.  I was finally sent an email the week that withdrawal period ended telling me that I needed to speak with an aid counselor.  When I got there, they told me that my verification and everything was good, but I was not going to get aid because they require a 75% completion rate, and by failing my class over the summer, I had dropped to 74.6%.  Because I had already filed my one appeal, I can't do that to fix this, and even if I had withdrawn from classes, I would have still had to pay for them, along with room and board.  The worst part is that the guy told me that starting next semester, the completion rate is dropping to 66%, but for this semester there's nothing they can do for me.

Since I found out about my situation, I've tried to apply for private student loans through Wells Fargo and Sallie Mae, but both have denied every cosigner I have had apply, which includes both my parents, my grandpa, and my brother.  I have no one else willing to cosign.  I've also looked into a credit card as a last ditch effort, but the best I can get is a $300 limit, and that just isn't going to work.  If I don't make it back to school in the spring, I'm pretty much guaranteed to have to start paying interest on my existing loans in addition to being sent to collections for $9000.  I have no idea what to do, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR- I made a mistake, lost financial aid, and don't know how to pay this $9000 school bill.",finance,1418168369

I used all three years on my deferment due to a series of circumstances that left me unable to pay. I am an undiagnosed Asperger's sufferer and have recently been considering a diagnosis and aid as I am becoming aware of my inability to care for myself. I currently work only part time, doing freelance editing, earning about $6000 gross a year. The work is not consistent, and though I have tried to expand my business, I don't believe it will be consistent enough to rely on for income. I have recently read about switching to income-based repayment, but I'm terrified at the thought of the repayment moving from 10 years to 30, as the loans were taken out prior to 2009. I also don't really understand how it affects the loan. It already seems that I am paying a crazy amount of interest for only $10,000 since I would end up paying back almost double the amount in ten years.
  
  
I could really use some advice here. There are three loans total, all federal subsidized, about $4500 (at 6.8 and 6.55%) on two and a little over $2000 (at %6.0) on the third.

I have been working hard the past few months to get my situation under control and budget. I will be paying off CC A when I get my tax refund, and will also pay down some of B, after which I will continue to pay the minimum while it's 0% interest. I spend probably $200-300 on average every month going out and on personal/nonessential purchases. The rest goes towards an emergency fund, right now I have about $900 in it.

I am about to take out another federal student loan to go to grad school in the amount of $16,500. I plan to make that last over the entire time I am in school, just for tuition. This loan will be at 6.2%.

All my student loans will go into deferment in January. I am leaning towards not paying anything on A or the new loan. I'm completely positive I will qualify for income based repayment around $150/month when I graduate, and then public service loan forgiveness 10 years after. I will use that money and some extra to pay off C by the time I graduate, and then start paying down B. I will continue to pay interest on B because the variable rate scares me. However, the interest on my federal loans will definitely outpace my income based payments, and I'm looking at about $60000 by the time they would be ""forgiven."" This seems like the best route to go, especially since PSLF is tax free and I don't see my income going up significantly.

This month I finally bettered my situation by paying off my credit card debt, freeing up the $535 I was throwing at both of them monthly to pay them down. I also increased my monthly salary.

Now that I've fixed the immediately problem (debt, never having enough money) I feel good, but that was just what I needed to do in order to actually start my financial life (I feel).

personalfinance,debt consolidation,"I'm 24, working as a cook at a high end restaurant. My girlfriend works at a bank. We relocated in march and have had to buy essentials like a bed and some basic furniture. When I first moved up I was making 2400 a month which was more than enough to cover all the expenses even without my girlfriends income. 

I have since started making just over 1000 a month, with around 13,000 in debt, some from before my relocation and some from furniture, mattress, car repairs credit card. 

I moved here with 5 dollars in my pocket and a bag of clothes.. My credit cards were practically maxed because a job opportunity I had taken had failed to meet its promises and left me making 150 a week instead of the 1500 I was promised. So I moved, got on my feet in two months and then drove down to pick up my girlfriend and move her up here with me.

I have tried to get a loan from a bank for debt consolidation. My credit is too weighed down right now and dropped from 740 to just below the banks requirements for a debt consolidation loan. 

I did the math and by combining my cards into one payment at a lower interest rate than the typical 18-24% at something like 10% interest I'd be saving almost $100 a month and have one due date instead of keeping track of 8 cards with 8 different due dates. 

My girlfriend and I are barely making ends meet right now, a ring was in the near future but is now looking more like the distant future if I can't get the debt under control. Does anyone know of anything other than a big bank or loan shark that does reasonable debt consolidation loans?

financialindependence,Rental vs Investment Income,"Which is superior, if any, in your opinion?  When comparing dollar to dollar, rental income seems inferior because it will be taxed as ordinary income, whereas investments (long-term gains) will not be taxed at all until I hit the 25% marginal income bracket (currently ~72K).  Am I correct in this assumption?

(edit) Addendum added for clarity:

Let's say of 19k gross rents I clear $13k rents after property tax (3k), insurance (1k), and property improvements (2k) on a paid off property worth $250k. I can claim roughly $5k of depreciation, for $8k taxed income.  Lets assume the house does not appreciate this year in question, though this would help that ROI number, but still would be taxed as gains on an investment property when sold.

This problem is compounded when you enter early retirement and are trying to set up your Roth pipeline. Now you have $8k to claim as normal income. Plus $32k converted (more income converted will only make the problem worse) from IRA to Roth (considered income as well) for a total of $40k income = $2051 federal, $1852 state for a total of $3903. Combined tax rate of 9.75%.

Now the opposite scenario: $250k invested in index funds. Not only is that $250k growing at 4% (assumed based on FIRE principles) for $10k a year, but now when doing the Roth pipeline, you only need claim $32k actual income = $1173 federal, $1481 state for total of $2654. Combined tax rate 8.29%, saving you over 1.5% in taxes.

Am I looking at this correctly?  Obviously, I am not taking real estate appreciation into account, but I am also not including the headache of managing a rental property.",finance,1418193459

I can't really get them to re-evaluate my interest rate to a lower rate because unfortunately I just joined with them. So far, the best option I can devise is that I first do a credit transfer outside of this bank (A) to bank B, and then back again to the new card. Bank B charges 3% for service, but this one time fee is on par with the (optimistically, at least) 2 month payoff time that I expect the debt to take to pay off.

Buying it for girlfriend and want the highest resale value if we break up.,"Backstory - not necessary to read for the financial question but here if you want: My girlfriend's older beater car broke down a little over a week ago. The engine needed to be replaced. It wasn't worth it to replace the engine so she went car shopping. She didn't have a lot to put down and her credit is poor because she's refused to open any credit cards. 

She ends up buying a car from a snakeoil car salesman who is the only one that offers her financing. She puts 500 down and finances the car at a high interest rate. Less than a week later she's driving to work and the cars engine catches on fire. 

So, now she has no money to put down on a new car anymore and is waiting to see how much she'll get back from the insurance company. She has a 500 deductible so we'll see if she even breaks even. 

She desperately needs a car to get to work (she's a commuter) plus drive her kid around. Unfortunately rideshare or public transportation aren't options because of where she works. 

We've only been dating a few months but seeing the huge mess she's gotten herself into is killing me. I have a poor credit rating but a high income. I want to buy her a reliable safe car so she doesn't lose her job and has transportation that won't threaten her life. 

Financial question: I want to buy a car that is affordable (less than 300 month payments and less than a 10% APR) but that will hold its resale value well enough so that if we break up I can turn around and sell it within a few months and not lose too much money. 

Trying to decide between a used 2012 Honda Civic EX with 51000 for miles for 12.5k with an interest of rate of 9% (probably) for 72 months putting me at payments around 250 - comes with a 12 month/12k mile warranty

A 2014 Chevy Cruz LS, brand new with zero miles for 15.4k financed at a 5.86 APR for 72 months putting the payments in the high 200's - comes with a standard 3 year/36k mile warranty

personalfinance,I'm 28 years old and have no idea how my financial life is doing. I want to throw it all away for a shot at college.,"I'm 28 years old and wondering why they never taught us financial planning in high school. I've just been winging it for the past 10 years and guess I'm not doing too bad, could be doing worse.

Throwaway to keep my financial details separate from main account.

I'm currently living outside of the US but let's assume all US laws apply to me except that I qualify for the foreign income exclusion. I pay no federal or state tax on income and contribute to an after-tax 401k (again with no actual tax).

Here's my financial rundown:

* I have a $237,000 mortgage with about $100,000 in equity. This is in California where the market is hot right now but even if it were to crash tomorrow I would still have roughly $30,000 in equity. Interest rate is low @ around 4.3%. 

* I'm currently renting out the house for $2100/month on a $1500/month mortgage payment, all taxes and insurance are included in my monthly payment. The $600 extra is going toward an emergency fund for the house which I've targeted to be $10,000. Right now there is ~$4000 in the emergency fund with an additional $4000 deposit by the current tenants. I am only contributing the $600/month to the fund.

* I have $1200 in a company matched 401k, contributing 6% of my income with 4% match. Investing all 10% in an S&amp;P 500 equivalent fund with Vanguard

* I have no credit card debt

* I have a $9000 debt consolidation loan at 17% APR. A lot of this money was credit card debt with deferred interest on payments for materials when I got the house into living conditions. I've saved a lot overall by paying off those cards before the retroactive interest kicked in, but I do realize I'm still paying interest on that money in this new loan. Payment is $325/month.

* I currently have no emergency fund/cash savings

* I have ~$20,000 (at current market rates) in gold/silver in my possession

* Currently paycheck is $2600/month. Only cost of living is $75 utility bill and a reimbursable $125 storage fee. Food, housing, and transportation is all covered.

How does is my financial outlook overall?

I want to pay down the debt consolidation loan quickly, probably $2000/month for the next 4.5 months. Is this wise considering I have no personal emergency fund? Should I be putting money into that fund while paying down the loan?

At what point can I start counting the $600/month rental income as income? Should that money never be touched or should it be invested or used to further pay down my mortgage? It'd really help offset costs when I start going to school.

What the heck should I be doing with my money? Let's say I kept $300/month of my pay for fun and misc. expenses. That leaves $2100/month left over less $325 for my debt consolidation loan, total of $1775/month. Is $300/month too generous to spend ""frivolously""?

I plan to stay out here for a few years and save up enough money to cover cost of tuition and minimal living expenses for 3 years ($60,000) so that I can attend university when returning to the states. I will have all possible classes done at community college done by that point. I plan to have a part time, minimum wage, job to help ease the financial burden. 

Back home in California I was earning $72,000/year (gross) but cost of living was way higher, this is what I'd be looking at if I returned to my career back in the US. However, I don't like my career field and really want to move into a totally different field that will require a college degree, which I don't have. Am I completely screwing myself financially by throwing this all away for school and even if so is it worth it to satisfy my professional life?",finance,1418228636
personalfinance,Is it possible to sue my private loan distributor for failure to offer me repayment options?,"Dear Reddit, I am a LTLFTW (Long time Lurker, first time writer).  I want to be as thorough as possible and am looking for sincere answers, so please do not waste my time. Thanks.
I would not say that my situation is atypical; I am a 20-something struggling with student loans.  My repayments have been hell, and I have around 8-9 loans to take care of.  Among those, four are federal loans (already adjusted with lowest payment possible) and the remainder are private loans.  I do not wish to divulge into the peripheral too much, because it is not integral to this situation.  What I want to focus on is AES.  Two of my loans are through AES as a third party, and I had exhausted all of my repayment options aside from a petition to forbearance (it really would not offer me any relief and actually hurt me in the long run). I recently called them to discuss my situation and have spoken to them almost daily for the past week. Recently I called to explain that I could not maintain payments, to which they had advised me to go delinquent.  I told them I want to give them my money, and am willing to negotiate a partial payment to stay in good standing, but they said options are not available.  
I called the next day and demanded to immediately go through to a supervisor, with whom I also ran to no avail.  My phone center savvy techniques aside, I managed to get to her manager and discuss options.  He was a bit more compassionate, but still unswerving.   To give a rundown, here is the basic scenario:
1) I have two loans through AES that are through Chase and PNC for roughly 10-11k each.  
2) I cannot contact either party through AES and they will not give me their information nor will they pass on information to them.
3) I called Chase and PNC, who cannot and will not dissolve my contract with AES and permit me to go directly through them.
4) I still have the option of private loan consolidation, although this will damage my repayment options long term.
5) Eventually t was suggested that I write a letter, which will be passed on to the original parties, although upon inquiring they admitted this has never shown any results.
At this point, I want to reiterate that I have no intention of inundating with too much personal information (I do not wish to have loan repayment help; this matter is concerning the financial aspect solely regarding AES).  What I have came to is this: 
 * upon rereading the contract, there are no specifications on repayment options.
 * They do offer to provide me with relief in the contract,.
 * They refuse to give me options for repayments and are threatening to hurt my credit, although I am offering partial payments and maintaining contact.

I'm still investigating a proper argument, but I am curious if this falls under usury at some point.  I know that they have a huge legal team, etc.  However, I do not know how to maintain payments for a company that is punishing me for being poor and trying to make amends.  Anyway, this is the rough cut of my situation.  I will gladly update, elaborate, etc.  I just need help in maintaining a relationship and getting this paid off as soon as possible.  If a suit is not feasible, I will gladly start a petition discussing the issues to send to them.  Thanks in advance.",finance,1418232034

personalfinance,Trimming the Fat: High Limit Card?,"I'm 32 and have been building my credit for roughly 12 years now. For the past year I've been budgeting my paychecks to within $20 in an effort to get out from under my debt accumulated during my less-responsible 20's. I've just joined a credit union offered through my work, and have also started making 403(b) contributions, so I think it might be a good time to reconsider my overall approach to dealing with my existing debt.

At this point I'm mostly just curious about the best route to take to trim the fat from my credit portfolio without negatively impacting my credit score. Here's a quick overview of what I'm working with:

**Credit Accounts**

My Experian score is currently 780, and FICO given was 787 so I'm good in that respect. Regardless, my debt had been choking me with interest fees so last year I transferred my credit card balance to two cards with 0% intro rates. (one card would have been ideal, but Chase only grabbed $6k of the $10k balance so the rest I transferred to a Discover). Here's where things sit presently:

* US Bank Visa: $0 balance, $16000 limit, 11.9% APR
* Discover: $1800 balance, $6000 limit, 0% until 08/14 then 20.9% ^^yuck
* Chase: $5200 balance, $6000 limit, 0% until 03/15 then 12.9%
* Consumer Cards (Lowe's &amp; Kohl's) Both: $0 balance, $2000 limit, assuming terrible APR, I rarely use them

**Other Debt**

* $4400 car loan (14 remaining payments @ ~$300/mo)
* ~$45000 stafford student loans, currently consolidated by federal loan servicing and 18 months into the [PSLF program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service) (making calculated IBR plan payments of $300/mo).

**Current Credit Card Debt Repayment Strategy**

* Calculated monthly payments to pay off Discover card balance on 08/14. (~$235/mo)
* Had been making minimum payments to Chase card in order to focus on Discover balance; adjusted to making $150/month payments until 0% rate expires in 03/15, then plan to open another 12 mo./0% balance transfer card through my credit union. I don't anticipate having to do this again since I'll have the balance down low enough in another year that the interest shouldn't be as debilitating to my budget.

**Questions**

* US Bank has been trying to coax me into replacing my Visa Platinum card with a new one for years now, but I've declined simply because I felt the high limit with $0 balance was significant helping my credit score. Is this accurate? Every card they have offered me was maxed at $6000, despite the fact that I've had this $16000 limit since '06.
* My credit union offers car loan refinancing at rates lower than my current loan. Since I only have 14 months left in the repayment period, should I look into refinancing or just focus on finishing it off?
* Is it generally better to have multiple cards with average limits, or fewer cards with higher limits? Assuming the overall limit is generally even in both cases, that is.

Thanks in advance for any input.",finance,1418234960

Bitcoin,"B-N man gets prison for ""illegal bitcoin operation""","PEORIA — A Normal man has been sentenced to four years in federal prison for running an unlicensed, multimillion-dollar bitcoin exchange on the Internet.

Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Shadid sentenced John D. Powell 55, to 48 months in federal prison and to serve three years of supervised release following his incarceration.

On July 31, Powell entered an open plea of guilty to two counts of operating an unlicensed money service business. He was sentenced last week. 

It was the first such case prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the Central District of Illinois, said that office.

Bitcoin is a cybercurrency that allows individuals to conduct transactions anonymously. According to court documents, Powell’s exchange business allowed individuals increased anonymity by exchanging cash anonymously for bitcoin.

Investigators found that Powell received more than $3 million from individuals during an 18-month period ending in February 2014, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

-----

A few years ago I was depressed, anxious and borderline paranoid. A heavy interest in politics and economics combined with a public education will do that to people these days. All through the public education machine I wondered... *Why are they doing things this way?* I mean it is the 21st century and we live in the richest country in the world. Your telling me that the school ran out of paper? *Seriously, you can't budget enough for paper?* Politics I don't even need to elaborate on. C-Span is as about as ridiculous as the comedy channel these days but its not funny because those people control our lives. 

Then along comes a Bitcoin. At first, like many of you I didn't give it the time of day. Then during my search for the causes of evil and the desire to find a form of money that isn't under the influence of bureaucracy or politics I stumble across Bitcoin again. I was really impressed, and amazed and thought it was too good to be true. I spent weeks locked in my room living off takeout and the mini-fridge trying to find the catch-22. Once I surfaced again I began to change. 

I admit it took a awhile to get balanced again but slowly over the last year I have settled down. My anxiety about the state of the world and the direction it is going in dissipated. I no longer feared the ignorance in the world and the crazy people in charge. I had a digital, stateless, borderless, indestructible, censorship-free form of trade, communication and money. At first it was the ultimate weapon in my mind. Visions of burning federal reserves and a crumbling capitol building filled my dreams. Its quite fun to be young and passionate about the world with a desire to change it. 

Over time the dreams have gotten more realistic. I realized that the old can not be destroyed without first having an alternative. This change would be rapid, but as our alternative grows the old system wanes. The fire engulfing the federal reserves became foreclosed signs. The crumbling capitol building became a museum and monument to the past. I understand that as much as I feel the primal urge to hang em all and let some invisible wizard sort the good from bad, we need to be better than them. We don't need to torture or kill our opponents, and especially not in some mob like fashion without a trial. Bitcoin threw back the curtain of our Wizard-of-Oz style oppressors. All we need to do to succeed is speak softly and offer the alternative. The way out of a system sustained with lies and corruption, the ultimate red pill.

If you truly believe in the core principles of Bitcoin then the free market must be pretty darn important to you. If you believe like I do that the free market is the most powerful than there will be no need for violence of any kind. Our product is vastly superior to anything else on the market today and it can adapt as fast as we need it to, so we will win. $1,000 per bitcoin was a valuation heard around the world. It was swiftly followed by the bursting of the parabolic bubble which has resulted in one of the longest if not to be the longest bear run in Bicoin's short history. Yet, I am not deterred. I have been inspired by what I have witnessed. 

I have watched as venture capitalists poor money into the system at a rate not seen sense the early days of the internet. Start-ups popped up faster than weeds in my yard. I participated in open beta's of new services that drew my attention and watched fondly as they grew in popularity. Two of my favorites are [LetsTalkBitcoin](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/) and [ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com/). I attended the first Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas and was pleasantly surprised to have my brain completely melted before the lunch break on the first day. 

People that are involved in this space are smart and I was definitely not even in the top 50% of most intelligent people in that room. I heard aerospace engineers asking questions to the panelists and listened to a Chinese exchange CEO explain that over 75% of the people registering for his exchange had engineering degrees. Those people really knew their stuff and they were all working in or wanting to get involved in Bitcoin. I was intimidated and as snobby as it may sound that doesn't happen often for me. 

This road of bits has not been without setbacks. I lost 15 bitcoins due to not making backup copies of a cold storage paper wallet. Needless to say the running joke among my friends from when I left $200 in a movie theater picked up new steam. My first project was a combination of proof of identity and counterparty to build a charity hub for completely transparent direct charities that could track your donation all the way to the actual items purchased. That project was a bit too ambitious for an amateur like myself but I see others have taken up that mantel in different ways that may be even be better than my approach. I then turned to entertainment where I wanted to bring something like the classic trading card games to the blockchain. I again started with the wrong approach and I stumbled upon this cool project [Deckbound](https://www.deckbound.com/) that is doing such a better job than I was that I scrapped my idea in favor of following that project. Sure things have not been smooth sailing for me so far, but I am not deterred.

Bitcoin is not just a superior product. It is one of only a handful of investments that I can also agree with morally. Putting money in a bank or brokerage went out the window after I studied the perpetual war machine and how it was funded and maintained. It basically boiled down to physical commodities and Bitcoin. Everything else was tainted with fiat coupons and they generally made me sick to look at. It was like I was living in the movie [*They Live*](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/2224633/they-live-subliminal-message-o.gif). I know it isn't very popular these days to invest based off of moral reasons, but I think maybe it would be a better place if more people did. 

The ""*real*"" markets don't really inspire much confidence now a days. The conspiracy theorists were generally proved right, all the markets are rigged. As Rinehart Founder Andrew Cunagin puts it in the WSJ article [here:](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-blames-high-frequency-trading-for-shutdown-1409853730) 
""This is a circus market rigged by HFT and other algorithmic traders who prey on the rational behavior of warm-blooded investors,"" - Mr. Cunagin. [GATA](http://www.gata.org/) has been screaming about commodity rigging for decades now. So if you trust the same people that are pushing for your currency in the bank to be [labeled as paper investments rather than money](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2014/11/warning-bank-deposits-will-soon-no.html) so they can *bail-in* whenever they are in the mood.... well goodluck to you. I am not much of a doomsday prepper myself but things like the [Treasury Department Spending $200,000.00 on Survival Kit For Bank Employees](http://freebeacon.com/issues/treasury-department-seeking-survival-kits-for-bank-employees/) definitely gets my attention. 

To me Bitcoin is the least risky investment in the world right now. A bold statement, one that should attract some attention if trolls spend the time to read this extremely long post. Investing in Bitcoin by buying bitcoins is like owning a limited edition part of an industry index. This industry already contains the best form of money, the best money authentication system, the best money transfer service, the best money security and privacy options, all while being completely censorship-free, unexpected inflation-proof and immune from politics or bureaucracy. Oh it also is just about the only value transfer service that makes sense for micro-transactions and the internet of things/trade between machines. So even if we see *the big dip* right before the Bitcoin Bowl in the next few weeks, I will not be deterred.

It is time for me to embrace plan B. Yesterday I announced my intention to completely cut myself off from the fiat money system by January 1st, 2015. I will get paid in bitcoins, I will pay my bills in bitcoins. I will invest in bitcoins and I will secure my own Bitcoin investments. I will protect my monthly spending coins from volatility using a Bitcoin service and use a Bitcoin debit card everywhere bitcoins are not currently accepted. I am also working to establish some pure Bitcoin revenue streams next year. This is not my first leap of faith into the wonderful world of crypto-currencies. I am intentionally and with due diligence strapping myself to this moon rocket and daring the world to stop it. So please don't comment telling me how risky this is, I am well aware of the risks. This risk I take is mine and mine alone and the profit if it succeeds will be too. I have no dependents and I am still young. Win or lose it will be one hell of a ride.

1,049$ visa debt (assuming 19%)

Factor in my student loan payment (550/month), im around 1400$/month. Which means I'm going to have a surplus of about 4,200$ per month.

My argument is that...

* since I won't see another salary increase for a full year, I'm effectively losing out on 1/2 a years increase
* The company would have paid the engineer in my position previously the full salary increase for the same performance
* US Inflation last year was ~1.5%, making this technically a pay cut

I'm not sure that's a strong enough argument. 

Is this just how it is, or am I getting fed some BS?

Edit: Thank You for the reply's below. I'm getting some good perspective &amp; understanding on this. I'm still a fairly new to salary's/negotiations and have had some other weird things happen to my salary in the first month's that have made me less than confident in the pay dept there (Different salary than I signed for[their fault and they fixed it], Bonus plan mentioned in signing contract that has still to be defined, flip flopping of benefits)",finance,1418268154

personalfinance,Another person that thought a degree would make life perfect...,"So, where to start ... It was 1985, and my mom was ready to pump out her 4th kid out of 8 ( we grew up hardcore Mormon ) ... maybe that's a little too early ...

I'm a 29 year old male
Never married
My assets are a 2006 Corolla with 100k miles, a $300 laptop, and clothes I've acquired over the years.

The real problem is I'm a loser. Let me elaborate. In our family, almost everyone is smart. Now there are two general categories our family falls into. The successful ones, making $100k+, and the other group, including myself, where we struggle with retaining jobs, staying motivated, and so forth. Doctors have assigned it to a whole bunch of disorders, but the basic fact remains; we stay losers our whole life. 

The main predicament is I cannot stay in a position for more than a year. I have been a farmhand, insurance agent, railroad conductor, and so forth. At 23, and a 3x college dropout, I finally pushed myself to complete a degree, even though I never should have, and came out at 27 with a bachelor's in Chemistry.

Since graduation, I was unable to acquire a position using my degree, and have returned to the basic positions I'm used to. Currently I'm a basic insurance auditor, making $17.50 per hour.   I started out strong ( usually the top employee in the first 3-6 months ), but already, the same old impulse, which builds, and eventually overcomes my weak self-control, will cause me to resign ( or risk being fired for low productivity ).  This entire cycle always ends in my unemployment within a year of starting a new position. 

I have now come to accept this could be a constant in my life, which will force me to live at ~1-2x the minimum wage ( positions like my current one pay higher than necessary, due to the terrible job position, which forces me to leave sooner. When I leave a job, I usually have a month or so where I use up whatever meager savings I've accumulated.

The question is, assuming I will make ~1-2x the minimum wage the rest of my life, with ~$50-60k in Federal student loans, ~$10-20k in private student loans, $3500 in 13% interest credit card, with current monthly expenses of ~$400-500 rent , $100 car insurance, $100-150 in prescriptions, $80-130 in doctor visits, $50 in phone bills, and the rest for food / gas / student loan bills, etc. , what would be the best general course of action with that assumption in place?

Thank you very much for your time. 

Update: I meant to give background on myself in order to show a continuous occurrence. I am taking care of the mental side. What I really would like are other financial ideas I have not thought of.

personalfinance,"Buy a car, home, or both at the same time: how will it affect the credit report?","We're in the market for a new house as we're outgrowing our current one.  At the same time, I'm also thinking about the upgrading my current car for a newer one.  The time period to purchase the house is 30-60-90 days, and it will be constructed from the ground up.  As for the car part, my sense of urgency in getting a new one is not only to rid of it before major repairs set in, but to also to get it now that I can afford it (so that I can space out these 2 major purchases).

I know the car purchase will affect how we will be applying for a new home loan and vice versa, the question is what strategy can I take to mitigate the negative effects it will have on the credit reports? 

My wife and I have good credit (&gt; 750) and major debts include mortgage, student loan and not a whole lot of CC debt.  Both cars are paid off.  Just like on our previous home, both of our names will be on the home loan.

Here are some ideas and I'll be more grateful for some critical feedback.  Other ideas are welcome too.  Do I have my priorities straight here?

1.  The first thing I'm thinking of is to be pre-approved for a new home loan and go through the whole home purchase process.  With no other major debt, we would be able to get the best interest rate possible.  After we've moved in and all the finances are in order is when I'll purchase the car.  However, there's the buying of new furniture and other new furnishings for the new home so more outlay of cash there.  By then I would have spent money on repairs for the old car and it would have lost some of its value.

2.  Instead of financing a new car, I'll lease it.  In this way, the amount owed on a lease won't look as large on the credit report as compared to having a full blown car loan.  For example, leasing a $40,000 car in where you're only paying the difference between the selling price and the residual value of the car won't be as much a red flag as compared to financing the entire $40,000 balance.  With this approach, the car will be on the credit report when we apply for the home loan.",finance,1418272253
personalfinance,Just how screwed am I? (450k in dental school debt!),"Hello personalfiance, I’m currently a D1 student in dental school and the thought of debt absolutely scares the living daylights out of me. I am trying to get the best advice from the best out there (that’s why I’m posting here) and I’d like to know if my numbers work and if I’m thinking about this the right way. Here’s the info:

Basic Info: Mid 20’s male, will be in about 450k debt (400 dental + 30k undergrad + 20k of accuing interest) gives me the nice rounded number of 450k once I graduate in 2018. I rounded all the interest rates to about 7% which is what it’ll be after you average everything out. 

I have three pathways to payback: PAYE (if I qualify depending on how Congress acts), IBR, or just normal 10 year payments. PAYE makes me pay 10% of my income for 20 years, where the IBR plan is 15% for 25 years. In both cases, the leftover forgiven amount after the 20th year is “taxed” as income. I will discuss the ramifications below. 

PAYE plan: I work as an associate for a few years or corporate, pay off PAYE payments (10% of income), open/buy practice, and continue to pay 10% of income payments (PAYE) for 20 years, and the rest is forgiven (taxed as income). I went to http://www.finaid.org/calculators/ibr10.phtml and punched in the numbers, leaving the default values for income growth (4%), inflation, and a “new” income after X amount of years. I put 175k after 7 years which seems about right. 

IBR: Same as above except the plan is 15% of my income per month as opposed to 10%. Repayment will also last 25 years maximum as opposed to PAYE’s 20 year limit. 

Normal 10 Year Plan: Perhaps go work associate, go work rural, go LIVE rural, go Alaska or go somewhere that dentists are in HIGH demand; live with parents? I have no idea, but I am totally willing to go a rural area and get paid good money for it, if it means paying off my loans faster. 

RESULTS:

PAYE plan: I would be forgiven 735k resulting in a tax bomb of 248k that I would need to save up for in the 20th year. 10% payments range from $900-$2000 as my income increases per year. 

IBR: I would be forgiven 488k resulting in a tax bomb of 150k, however, my 15% monthly payments would be $1300-$3800….and the payment schedule is 25 years, not 20 years. 

Normal 10 Year Plan: I don’t know how the pay is in rural, high-demand areas, but I would need to cough up $5225 per month and this is just unfeasible.

Conclusion: I am absolutely scared of what I will have to do. I want to work hard; I want to help people; I want to go places where I am needed. But I also know the responsibilities of having to pay back nearly half a million dollars in debt. I was only accepted to 1 dental school and it was a private one. All of these plans scare me…even PAYE scares me. I am not sure if I qualify, so I’ll have to wait and see what Congress decides to do with regards to PAYE. Either way, my ideal situation is to open up my own private practice (either buy or build, which would result in more loans) but I could pay them off much faster. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1418275815
personalfinance,Is there a way to protect myself if I lend my parents money?,"Long story storter: My parents who are retired and have only pension as income are terrible with finances and they've got a credit card debt of $7000... They also have a mortgage and car payments so they owe some amount on those although I'm not nearly as concerned about that as the CC debt because it's got a much higher interest rate.

I have the means to lend my parents the money to pay off their CC debt and stop paying the credit card companies so much interest.  However, I've already lent them a couple grand and they are in no position to pay me back in the forseeable future.  I think a fair way to go about this, is I lend them the money to clear off their credit cards, and then they start paying me the month payments they were going to pay their credit cards.  However, I'm afraid they will find excuses not to make those payments as their daughter is not as scary as a credit card company.  Can we work out a legal way of showing the money lent and owed?  So that one day I will be paid back, maybe when the house is sold? I'm not terribly concerned about being paid back promptly it just deeply upsets me to think I will give them 10G I will never see again. That is a very large sum for me, especially because I havent even paid off my student debt yet.

I had a relative pass away and leave me some money - more than enough to pay off my student loan debt in full and have some left over. I don't use it for anything other than student loan payments right now. I'm 23 and just got my first real job in a corporate office, salaried at $35,000.

I was discussing my student loan debt with my father and told him that I wanted to take that money I inherited and use it to pay off my loans in full, so that I can start on my own with a fresh slate. He *very* adamantly told me that he strongly disagreed with that approach and that it was a horrible idea. However, he could not give me any reasoning behind it other than, ""it's just a bad idea.""

I've done some Googling around on the topic. All I've found is that it's a bad idea to do if you have other, more pressing debts - like credit card debts. I don't have any credit cards. I don't have any other outstanding debt besides these student loans.

I feel pretty strongly about this and would really like to get this resolved as soon as I can.

personalfinance,Question about pensions,"I am a 34-year old guy and I have two pension type retirement accounts from previous jobs. One is vested (almost 10 years) and one is not (less than 3 years). I'm questioning whether to leave the money (of which I have no idea the amounts at all as I do not receive any financial disclosures) within the respective pensions or to withdraw them and roll them into an IRA with Vanguard. Both are with Government (one state, one federal), but I really don't trust the management of either, especially when I can't see how the money is being managed or performing. The other reason why I don't trust the management of the money is because the state pension fund was raided by our outgoing Governor to replace a budget shortfall.

Bitcoin,Microsoft and the bitcoin price...,"It seems like every time there is some good bitcoin news (specifically a new retailer or organization coming on board), everyone assumes that the price should react to it and skyrocket.  And then it doesn't.... There's even the ongoing joke that good news means the price will go down because of this.

So why?   Well I'm no genius, and I am nothing close to an expert on economics.... but it seems pretty obvious to me that new retailers accepting bitcoin RARELY provides any incentive whatsoever to the average person to acquire and use bitcoins over their standard USD.  That's the bottom line.

Imagine if overnight, 100 new top retailers started to accept bitcoin.  It's the biggest bitcoin news ever!  But why would this drive the price up?  Unless Joe Sixpack can buy the things that he needs for a better deal with bitcoin, he is not going to give a rat's ass.  Joe Sixpack doesn't give a shit about the Fed.  The average person's behavior is dictated by how it benefits themselves.

Bitcoin might go to the moon if bitcoin provides some actual incentive for people to acquire them, for example people getting significantly better deals on OpenBazaar, or people previously unable to engage in online commerce having this door opened up to them.

I am engaged, and my fiancé will be moving in with me next June, cutting Rent/Utilities in half at that point. However, she will be student teaching next fall (Graduating Dec 2015), so she won’t be contributing much else to the budget. (But, she has no debt whatsoever).  I would also like to put money into savings for our wedding in August 2016 (which I’d like to be ~8-10k).

Since I’ve started a new job, two of my benefits start at the 90-day mark; Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 401k options.   The 401k can be traditional or ROTH, and is matched at 50% up to 6%, (and then vested based on years of service. 1yr=34%, 2=67%, 3=100%). The ESPP plan is invested in the company’s common stock, after tax.  The stock is priced at ~$61, has seen 21% growth over the last year, and the Div/Yield is 0.24/1.56.  The match is not paid immediately; it is made on contributions made during the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

As of right now, I have no separate savings accounts with money set aside, except for $500 in a savings account setup for wedding funds.

So, my questions are:
	I assume I should prioritize CC debt, then the 6.8 and 4.5% student loans, then the car loan.  Am I correct in that logic? 
I also am a member of a credit union, and could get 2.9% on the auto loan, but only with a co-signer since I have very little credit history.  I am planning on trying to refinance through them next spring to try and get a lower %.  And I know I can consolidate my student loans, but as they are Federal loans the new interest rate would be the weighted average of the current loans.  So I wouldn't want to do that now, buy maybe when I get the 6.8% paid off (And maybe the 4.5%?), correct?
	I know I should at least put the 6% into my 401K, but should I put in more than that, or focus on bringing down my debts?  And I definitely plan on moving up in tax brackets before I retire, so I’d want to put into the ROTH vs the traditional, correct?
	Lastly, should I take advantage of the ESPP, or focus on bringing down my debts first, and then use that as an investment option?  If I should do it, then how much for that versus debt payments?
	Any other advice you'd offer me?

Firstly, I work for a small company (3 full time staff members) and subsequently I am not offered a 401(k). From the research I have done, it seems as though a Roth IRA is the most beneficial to me at this time.

Also, from readings I have done on Reddit, I have seen some suggestions that online banking offers more interest such as credit unions. Apart from not having a direct brick and mortar bank are there true advantages to banking online with say a credit union and how safe are they? I am currently with Wells Fargo and I'm not entirely sure if they offer the best interest rates etc.

personalfinance,Poor Debt Payoff Plan?,"I have been reading some of the student loan faqs on reddit to determine if this repayment mindset I have is something that I should attempt or not. 

**My main question is whether I should cash out my Roth IRA (about $10k) and use it to pay off my car, credit cards, and a portion of my student loans, and then do the snowball debt repayment method to start eating away these loans faster.** -- **Decided not to cash it out, but possibly recharacterize my roth back to IRA?**

I am 28 years old and sitting at about $77,705 in student loan debt (went to a private school not thinking about how it would effect my life after college... typical mistake). I work a 9-5 office job making about $40k in Ohio. I net about $2,600 per month. My budget looks as follows:

**Rent:** $350 (split with gf)  
**Car:** $200  
**Car Insurance:** $90  
**Fuel:** $100  
**Cell:** $75  
**Credit Card:** $50 (14.65% int)  
**Subsidized Student Loan:** $175 (5.875% int)  
**Personal Student Loan:** $600 (9% variable int - weren't offering fixed at time of consolidation)  
**Internet:** $30  
**Food:** ~$200-400 (this one fluctuates the most with groceries and going out to eat (which we shouldn't but often do when we go back to Indiana each month to visit family)  

This maths out to roughly $2000/mo in expenses prior to any additional things we may do to the holidays currently. In addition, I just moved to Ohio in February and decided I would roll my 401k from my old employer into a Roth IRA while it was a small amount (~$8,800). In doing so, I have been trying to set aside about $3000 for tax time to cover the taxes for the recharacterization since I did not have taxes withheld. (which I have been trying to set back about $500/mo lately to get ready for tax time)

Is it dumb of me to think of cashing out my Roth after the new year (I believe I would only be hit with the 10% penalty and possibly taxes on the gains at the time) and paying off my credit cards and my car, which would allow me to take that $250/mo and bump my smaller student loan payment from $175 to $425/mo.

**Would look like this:**  
Current Values:  
* Roth Value: ~$9,500  
* Car Loan: $5,800  
* Cards: ~$800  
* Small Loan: $13,880  
Proposed Values:  
* ~~Roth Value: 0~~  
* ~~Car Loan: 0~~  
* ~~Cards: 0~~  
* Small Loan: ~$10,950  

Is this a stupid idea? Should I just keep going as I am right now until I am earning a bit more money? I will have a little extra money to add towards payments next year when I am not socking away $500/mo to pay for taxes.

Any thoughts would be helpful! I really just wanted to get some answers so I stop thinking about this like I have for the past few months.

Congress has quietly passed an Intelligence Authorization Bill that grants the executive branch virtually unlimited warrentless access to the communications of every video game playing American and gives this information to not just federal agencies but to local law enforcement as well. While similar powers have been asserted by executive order before nothing on this level has ever been passed by congress and for it to pass without so much as a debate is completely unjustifiable.

At the last moment representative Justin Amash found the true intent of the bill and was able to make a motion to reconsider. The bill has passed but has not yet been sent to the president to sign, we still barely have the ability to change the original vote but you need to contact your representative immediately and let them know that the bill in it's current form is completely unacceptable.

economy,The 14% flat-luxury tax will save America.,"While politicians and the top 5% of this nation will be buying $100,000.00 yachts and multi-million dollar estates, why am I being penalized harder in taxes as a middle class citizen when I reside in a moderately sized home with few luxuries like the other millions of people in the United States?

The United States has one of largest gaps between the wealthy and the less fortunate, one of the most unequal distributions of wealth and the top 1% of this nation secures almost all of the wealth in capital.

With that being said, drying out the income with heavier taxing policies on the middle and lower class citizens is only distancing the opportunities from people who need them most.

In order for the Federal Government to keep the flow of tax money steady, we need to institute a tax system that equally sets a percentage standard based on the average amount of income in the upper, middle and lower class.

This is what I propose:

-The bottom 40% of individuals in the lower class will pay a 4% federal income tax, while the top 60% will pay a 5% federal income tax.

-The bottom 50% of individuals in the middle class will pay a 7% federal income tax, while the top 50% will pay a 8% federal income tax.

-The bottom 50% of individuals in the upper class will pay a 10% federal income tax, while the top 50% will pay a 11% federal income tax.

-Next, all luxury items over $250,000.00 will also include a 14% luxury tax. These items would include 2nd/3rd estates, yachts, automobiles, helicopters, etc., things outside of the basic needs of living that are extras.

-Lastly, a 5% Federal sales tax would be instituted across all 50 states instead of 8.25% in some states.

I strongly believe this system would allow the impoverished to have more opportunities, as well as the middle class, and allow them to thrive instead of holding on to a thin thread of after-taxes income. Also, it will allow the rich to continue to thrive exponentially a while still having a completely fair tax rate.",finance,1418350591
personalfinance,Should I pay off final debt or begin saving for a house?,"I have two major goals as of right now.

2. buy a home within 3 years

The price range for a home I want is roughly $150k. I'll obviously need 20% of that for my down payment. 

Should I pay off this debt fiercely or just begin to throw higher concentrated payments at it while saving? My credit score is still pretty low so it'll take a year or two to rebound I'd think. I currently have $2,500 in an emergency fund which I plan on building as well but isn't top priority.

personalfinance,Parent refuses to allow me to use 529 to pay for school...Not sure what to do.,"I'm currently paying for medical school with federal unsubsidized loans at a 6.21% interest rate. Two years into school, I've had to take out $62,000,  $3,000 of that in outstanding interest alone. I still have two more years to pay for, and expect have to take out about the same-so looking at over $120,000 plus interest in student loan debt to get my medical degree. My problem is that I have a little bit of money left in my name by my grandfather (who passed away about 10 years ago), but my mother is not letting me access it. 

He had started a UTMA account for me when I was born. Her story is that she was advised to take money from the original account and start a Smart 529 account for me about ten years ago. Currently, the UTMA has about $40,000 in a mutual fund (...another thing I have an issue with...but I'll save that for another time) and after 6 years (I'm 25 now), I was finally able to get her to sign the paperwork to remove her as custodian. However, she has not agreed to allow me access the 529 account, which has about $20,000 in it (I think). My mom thinks it's a better idea for me to take out student loans for school, and allow the 529 to keep earning money off the investments, then use it after I graduate to make one big payment towards my debt, because it has ""tax consequences"" if I take money out now to pay for tuition. She also said that because the 529 earns more than my interest rate for student loans, it'd be stupid to take money out of it now. 

From my shamefully limited understanding of these types of accounts, her reasoning is completely wrong. The whole point of the 529 is that there wouldn't be any tax consequences if applied for tuition...right? And if I did wait till after I graduate, I'd pay a huge portion in taxes upfront because I didn't use it for tuition, while accumulating interest on $20,000 worth of student loan debt. The thought of losing money to taxes and interest just doesn't make sense to me.

Am I wrong on this? She has a personality disorder, and discussing these accounts has been impossible. I should add she inherited millions and hasn't had to work a day in her life, so it's not like I'm being greedy here. I'm at the point that I'm happy I got the UTMA in my control, and am ready to give up on the 529. I'm not even sure I have any legal right to it, since she started it from the money my grandfather left me. I am going to be a doctor, so I'll at least have a stable income and be able to pay off the debt...eventually.",finance,1418361641

personalfinance,Employer wants to pay me as both an Employee and Independent Contractor as part of a raise,"I did some searching to see if fits with the rules/FAQ or if it has already been answered, and didn't see anything that addressed this specific question.  My apologies in advance if I missed it.

I have worked at this company for four years as an employee.  It was acquired by another company a year ago, and most positions including mine transferred over.  This is the first raise offered under the new management.

My current salary as an employee is $56,550/year.  They have offered to increase my salary as an employee to $65,000/year, which is great.  However, I had been asking for more.  To make up that difference, they also offered to pay me a $12,000/year ""Service Bonus"" as an independent contractor.  This ""Service Bonus"" is not contingent on anything, and is to be paid in $3,000 increments at the end of every quarter.  Rather than being part of my paycheck, this will be paid to me in a separate check without anything withheld, and I will be issued a 1099 at the end of the year.

Naturally, I'm suspicious as to why they chose this route instead of just having it be part of my salary, and the only vague answer they provided to me was ""for tax reasons.""  I've done some limited research and see that the IRS does allow workers to be classified as both an employee and an independent contractor for the same employer, but it seems to apply to only limited scenarios that do not fit my situation.  One recommendation I have read is to fill out a Form SS-8, ""Determination of Worker Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Witholding,"" but that seems more confrontational than I would like to be with my employer.

Even if this dual employment type arrangement is okay or falls into a grey area, my next question would be about tax implications.  Are my tax burdens different when receiving $65,000 salary + $12,000 as a 1099 Independent Contractor compared to if I was receiving $77,000 salary?  If so, how?  I realize I will be responsible for paying taxes for the $12,000 on my own, but will the tax rates that I am paying be affected?  At the end of the year, would I be paying the same amount in taxes under either scenario?  By the same token, is the company incurring any tax penalties or benefits by using this form of payment?  I am happy to work out the calculations for myself, but I don't know enough about what rates apply in what situations to even begin.

Even if these questions are not answerable here, if anyone has advice on who to consult for an answer, it would be appreciated, because I am not sure if this would be better discussed with an attorney or with a tax consultant.

personalfinance,WWYD: Sell or keep second car?,"My husband and I just had our second kiddo and bought a new car (long story, but we replaced one that had a long history of issues, the latest of which was being run into by some jackwagon without insurance). We legitimately needed a bigger car to haul both kids, and since we both work at the same place, it's really easy for us to carpool.

We are about two months from paying off our other car, and right now all we really use it for is convenience, running errands, etc. It's a much smaller car, and we never take both kids anywhere in it (although we can take one without any issues). Technically we COULD carry both kids in it, but it would be extremely cramped.

There's a part of me that wants to keep the second car for convenience. Once its paid off, we will just be paying insurance on it, which amounts to about $40/month. Having it ensures that neither of us is stuck at home while the other is out and about. The area where we live doesn't have a good public transportation system, so it's definitely much more convenient having the second vehicle.

I completed a car loan with Chase Financing about four years ago and paid off all remaining credit cards. I had poor-average credit (low to mid 600s based on agency) at the time and was moving across the country for a new job. I didn't want to risk falling into my old, poor spending habits so I closed my credit cards and relied solely on my debit card.  

Fast forward to two years ago and it is time to purchase a new car. My grandmother offered to let me take a personal loan against my inheritance at a steal of an interest rate and got me a great deal on the car since I paid cash in full. I haven't had a credit card since moving (five years ago) and I haven't had a car loan in nearly as long.  

When I applied for the home loan last week I found my slate has been wiped clean. With no active reporting to my credit, I have fallen off the face of the planet in their eyes. Since then I have opened a small credit card ($500) and put some of my monthly expenditures on it.

What do? I'm also considering trying to find a better credit card with rewards, since I'm essentially paying a fee on my current one just because of low interest rate (thought I'd struggle my first couple months out of the house, ended up fine).

So does your history at a bank matter a lot? Compared to credit rating too. I'm not looking for a loan any time soon, but trying to build credit for later on.

Basically, a couple weeks ago I was rejected by Chase Freedom (read some success stories about people with no credit) and then Capital One Quicksilver (by recommendation of a coworker who said it was his first card). 


Today I just got a pre-screened offer in the mail for the Capital One Platinum card (I read somewhere that if it has the prescreen opt-out info it is tailored offer and not just an invitation to apply).


My question is:

* If I have done nothing regarding credit in the past weeks since being rejected by Capital One is this prescreened offer they sent me simply marketing? 

Do you think I should:

* just try sending in the application anyway? 

* apply for the Discover It card (people seem to like it, say it can be easy to get) but that is also what I heard about Chase Freedom and Capital One Quicksilver.

* apply for a local credit union card (at which I have no account, but my dad said he'd be willing to be an authorized user on a card as long as it was not a major company such as chase, cap one, etc)

Here's what's got me excited and realizing just how dire my situation is: I've discovered this sub and Dave Ramsey. I did baby step 1 ($1,000 in savings) and now want to do baby step 2 (pay off credit cards) and all of my debt ASAP. 

I got a decent raise that I'm excited about, my lease is up in January and I can keep rent around the same or a little less. I had a roommate lined up but she asked me to pay her deposit and fees which was not a good sign and didn't have a stable job. 

I started thinking if I got an apartment a block from my new office, which is near multiple grocery stores, bars, etc, and my running group meetup, I could potentially get rid of my car and easily slash about $450 (note, insurance, gas) away a month. I would get a bike and use Car2Go when I needed to take a longer trip ($14/hr max rate). I also have a sister in town who has two cars. Is that a crazy idea? It would easily allow me to have around $1K after bills each month to devote to my credit card debt then I would start slashing my student loans. I am sick to my stomach seeing the interest I would pay until 2029 on that Wells Fargo loan. 

Please, someone, tell me how to approach this in the most efficient, effective way. I do not want to live the rest of my life under crushing debt/stress.

What retirement account should I start (I don't have any)? I'm thinking an IRA, but you guys know better than I. How much money should I put aside for taxes and self-employment taxes (I'm single, no dependents)? I'm seeing around 40% on some sites. Quick calculations on turbotax shows I'll definitely owe less than that, but I'm going to put 40% aside and anything I don't owe I will save at the end of the year. But Where should I put this money before taxes are due? Where should I save my emergency fund?

Typically the comments to these are a lot of questions about what my expenses look like, so here's the grand total:

Income after -40%: $36,300

Rent: $800/mo  
Utilities, Cable, Internet: $100/mo  
Federal Subsidized Loans: $280/mo  
Other debt (will be paid off completely by end of 2015): $400/mo  
Food, Eating Out, Fun, Transportation: ~$150/wk  
Everything else (from clothing to trips to nonessentials): $2,000/yr  
Buffer Expenses (gifts, random): $750/year  

Leaves ~ $6,800. My goal is an emergency fund of $5,500, $1800 in an IRA, and whatever I have leftover after taxes will be saved/invested/put toward retirement (not sure). But I am COMPLETELY open to any and all suggestions.

personalfinance,Student loans or savings?,"I have some options ahead of me: 

Option #1: Finally pay off student loans but completely drain my stocks, which I’m using as a savings/emergency account. 
Option #2: Keep on paying the minimum and randomly pay off a little more here and there and keep my stocks as a form of emergency. I can still aim to pay it off in 2 years. I want to play with Lending Club or Propser but I don’t think it’s worth the risk with debt.

The background on my debt:

I started with ~49k debt after graduate school in 2012.  For those that don’t know, grad school debt accompanied with higher interest rate than undergrad debt. Mine is actually 6.8%.  This was a recipe for potential disaster. I now have 18k left of this debt.
For a bit in 2014 I was a contractor, which meant more money for me at the cost of no benefits.  During this ~4 month period I made sure I maxed out my Roth IRA.  The general consensus of past post in this subreddit would be I messed up and should have paid off my student loans. 

My current state of savings:

In total I have 15k in stocks and 4k in checking. 
I have my money in 2 ETFs that follow the S&amp;P 500.  I would put some money into IVE one month and then put money in IVV the next, so if I absolutely needed it I could take out money without being charged (commission free trading as long as the last-trade of that stock was 30-days ago).  Around September I decided to just totally forget about alternating this and I bought a large amount on margin. The S&amp;P goes up on average 7% per year, so as long as there is not a massive crash, this bet should be better than strictly paying off my student loans.  To make sure I am not getting dominated by interest I have scheduled $280 a week to be moved into my investing account.
To further help my financial situation, I did a car share program (RelayRides) and earned a little short of $2,000 off my 12 year old car which just hit 80,000 Mi. I recently stopped this because I got sick of people only wanting my wheels around the holidays.",finance,1418441232

It also allows me to contribute additional money to an After-tax 401k, and immediately roll it up into the Roth 401k or an existing Roth IRA.
There is some legal limit to how much I can contribute there, but for practical purposes this means I can make unlimited contributions to the Roth 401k, though I only get a match for the first 18k combined (to Roth + 401k).

I can only get the tax-deferment from the 401k by contributing to it, reducing the match available in the Roth.

I expect to be in the 28% federal tax bracket next year, and my total contributions to retirement accounts will be in excess of 18k after-tax either way.

Loan rate approx 3.25% and a flat $50 origination fee

401k plan does not disallow future contributions nor does this impact company match when a loan is outstanding.

Employee is in the 25% marginal tax rate bracket.

Employment is unionized and with a public utility company so should be viewed as stable, but obviously not iron clad.

Employee has intentions of reworking budget and accelerating savings next year in hopes of paying off the 401k loan quickly.

The thought was that a tax deductible contribution would net a 25% federal income tax savings for tax year 2014.  Conflicting view was that employee should just save and contribute the money next year (they won't be near 401k and/or ira contribution limits) and just take the savings next year and avoid the fees associated with the loan.

I have several private student loans, as well as government student loans -- mainly from 2007-2008 -- that I've had difficulty keeping up payments on over the years and defaulted, etc. Long story short, it looks like at some point in 2013, one of the private loan debts was cancelled by the bank (it was one from 2008).

I never received notification of this, thus I had no clue (which I know isn't an excusable reason for anything legal). Even if I had, I still would've had no clue this would somehow count as income on my tax return. The federal government already withholds my tax returns yearly as it is (for said government loans), so suddenly getting a letter saying I owe over a grand by January 7 has really thrown me through a loop today.

Guys, I know I spent a lot on eating out.  Believe me, it shocked me as well. I wasn't paying attention and I only realized it when I reviewed my expenses.  The obvious ""holy shit, you should stop that"" answer is to not eat out anymore.  The bigger and better question is this:  how do I pay down the debts that I have so that I can get on track again?  Even if I stop eating out (which I am), I still have a mountain of debt. I'd really appreciate it if someone could look past the stupid mistakes I've made and offer some suggestions of how to pay down my debt.  I will have more money and feel that I can actually do something about it now. Please help me.

Thanks for dealing with my reddit illiteracy.  I will get there eventually.  :)

_________________________________________
Let's start with the basics.  

Hi, I'm a school psychologist living in Los Angeles, CA.  I'm in my late 20's and just graduated from graduate school over the summer. Good news is that I'm working and have just secured an even better paying position that I will hopefully begin training for this coming week. I will give specifics in a moment.  I have an undergraduate degree from a private college that I attended for a BA in music.  While I can hear the groans from across my computer and before the post is even up, just know that I was aware I wouldn't have many job prospects when leaving, although I was able to work for a few years before graduate school regardless and making a decent (35-45k) salary.  Why did I go to a private school?  Well, my parents never went to college and nobody even sat me down to say ""hey, you may want to choose a school that is cheaper"".  In fact, I was raised to be poor, so they encouraged me to go and to take out loans to do so.  Same thing happened as I continued through graduate school.  In fact, if there is one life motto by which my family lives it is this: ""Rob Peter to pay Paul"" or perhaps ""yes, but can you afford the monthly payment"".  Now, these aren't excuses.  Please know that an excuse is me thinking that these things are good or ok.  I actually think the opposite. I just want everyone to know my habits and where I'm coming from so that you can help me break out of it.  

Following my graduation from my undergraduate degree, I secured minimal employment and moved out as soon as I could.  I had moved in with a roommate who I trusted at the time.  The apartment cost 1300/month and I was earning roughly 1400-1500/month working full time.  Eventually, they cut my hours at work and I was forced into a second job.  Why you might ask?  Well, my roommate had ""decided to get evicted"" even though one person cannot get evicted while the other remains.  I took on the brunt of the bills and told him to leave, but he just ignored me.  When it finally became too much, I approached my landlord to ask about options.  He said that I could get a new roommate or buy out the lease (pay 2 months rent and not receive my deposit back).  On my measly pay/month, I was unable to do that and had not found a new roommate, so I decided to buy out the lease.  Unable to fork over 2 months of rent at the time, and deathly afraid that I would have an eviction on my record for all eternity, I used the check that Chase had sent me for my credit card and put it on there.  It hurt to drop 2600 on something that I would never get back, but I didn't know what else to do.  So, that's how my credit card started.  

I had moved back in with my parents, and was attempting to secure a different, higher paying job when my luck turned for the better.  I got a job as an admissions rep for Everest College (yes, I know how bad that sounds) that paid 35k/year with a raise almost guaranteed at 6 months.  I jumped at it and saved up for an apartment so that I could move closer and just move out of my parents' place.  I commuted mostly by scooter at the time, as my parents had paid for my scooter outright back when I was in college, and I didn't need a car for the most part.  While working at Everest, I broke my foot one day.  This made it impossible for me to take the scooter and I stood far too long in the rain one day waiting for a friend and/or the bus.  Later that day, I bought a car.  The car was a solid 7k or so -- used, and stick shift. I got the best I could for what I could afford.  I also took an additional warrantee not knowing that it was worthless as my family had never bought a car from a dealership before.  So I ended up with 13k in loans from that.  Now, what I should have done was to pay off my car, credit cards, and pay down my loans as quickly as possible.  Naturally, that did not happen since I was so excited to have money that I just bought whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.  I operate mostly on my debit card instead of my credit card, so I rarely incurred additional debt on credit.  Sadly, it only took a few medical bills to make my credit what it is today.  I won't take you through the rest of my life up until now -- not only because it will bore the crap out of you, but also because it's just way too long to post.  **Here are the mistakes that I made:** 


1.) My graduate school cost a lot of money -- let's just say I tapped out the lifetime allotment of loans for an individual from the government.  


2.) I quit some higher paying, stressful jobs for jobs that suited my personality and were lower paying/unreliable on payment.  


3.) I have had multiple roommates for whom I provide additional support because I understand what they are going through and that has really hurt my finances so far


4.) I leased a new car recently.  If you had seen my old car, which I still had from post-undergrad, you would probably understand why I did it. There was no way it would have lasted and I had no money to repair it.  Plus, I have been working 2 hours away from where I live to try and make ends meet.  


So, as you can tell by just my background information, I am in debt.  I try to live within my means, but am struggling significantly.  I have a mountain of loan debt which is coming due soon (very soon) as the 6 month grace period is ending very quickly.  I can give you numbers, but I haven't had the chance to look this month at the true weight of the debt -- so I may need to just put down estimates for the time being.


**Student Loan Debt:**  
   Direct Loans:  234000     varying interest rates, combination of sub and    
   unsub

   Perkins Loan: 6000    3.4% interest rate, I believe this one is subsidized, so it hasn't accrued more interest while I      
   have been in school

   Private Loans: 37,367.69     3.73% interest rate.  These are also subsidized


**Credit Card Debt:** 
    Wells Fargo Credit Card: 913       ~12% APR.      

     Chase Credit Card:  5957.30   ~20% APR


**Car:**  
     Toyota Prius: 10392    ~3% APR


**Earnings:** 
   Old job/current budget: 2905/mo net + 300-400 extra income from other jobs.  Not reliable for budgeting 
    purposes. 

   New job/new budget: ~5000/mo net + optional 150-200/mo in alternative income


**My current accounts:** 
  Account 1: 123
  Account 2: -161 with +200 pending deposit


These are both checking accounts -- I have no savings account as I had made too many transfers from what used to be the savings into the checking account during grad school -- so I am now left with 2 checking accounts and neither of them look good. 

**Monthly Costs:** 
  
   *Rent: 625/mo
  
   *Utilities: 50/mo
  
   *Phone: 80/mo
  
   *Netflix: 7.99/mo
  
   *Food: 250/mo
  
   *Laundry: 20/mo
  
   *Personal care items: 30/mo
  
   *Gym: 30/mo
  
   *Car Insurance: 200/mo
  
   *(Loans): ~600/mo - haven't kicked in yet.  
  
   *Wells card: 35/mo
  
   *Chase card: 150/mo
  
   *Online program subscriptions: 50/mo (getting rid of these)
  
   *Medical Debt monthly payment: 40/mo
  
   *Eating out: Fluctuates but last month it was 1050.  Usually, it's about 400-500

I also have about 400 in other medical/bill debts that need to be paid and are just coming back around to me now.  

I have already frozen my gym membership -- bringing it down to 10/month for the moment.  I have also started to cancel my other subscriptions.  I actually need to go out and drive Lyft to get some extra cash through the door.  I am also owed about $600 from a second job that hasn't paid me quite yet.  I own no liquid assets and I'm pretty much screwed.  I took the time to look through my spending habits over the past 3 months and was shocked to see how much money I spent on eating out.  We had a little vacation in there, so I'm sure that's where most of it came from.  My boyfriend and I have agreed that we will not be going out really at all for quite a while.  Luckily,  even though I am female, I don't really engage in the amount of high-priced personal care that most females do. That means that I don't do pedicures or manicures unless I do them at home, and I only get my hair done once every 4-6 months.  I also get one waxing thing done every other month, and that falls into my personal care budget, so it's already accounted for.  I'm a bit worried to be honest because this new job is expecting me to dress and look a certain way and there is no way that I can afford to do so (e.g., suits, good makeup, manicures, pedicures), especially in the financial shape I'm in.  The other side is that I want to be realistic.  I'm willing to cut a majority of my budget down to only what I need, but I also enjoy going out and having fun.  I try to find low cost/free things to do and am just beginning to sign up for volunteer opportunities as it's totally free and something to do -- plus, it helps with depression which is a very unsavory trait that I currently possess. 

The positive:  I have found ways to budget in the past that have worked a bit.  I came up with this envelope method for my daily spending cash when I first moved into an apartment that really worked well for me.  All other money was paid out automatically to bills.  I also have a Mint.com account, so I have started to analyze my spending habits a little closer. 

I'm also a relatively talented couponer -- but I won't coupon if the cost outweighs the time or if I'm short on money.  The stockpile has actually saved me and my boyfriend a significant amount [read: over 200] in personal care items since moving here.

personalfinance,"Optimizing my situation (student loans, stock options, etc)","I'm looking for PF's advice on optimizing my financial situation.  Specifically, I have some student loans that I am diligent in paying monthly, but I'm wondering if there's ways I can more efficiently handle my money.  Here are my stats:

* Monthly take home pay (post-tax): ~3000
* Rent: ~1000
* Student loan 1 (8.68% interest rate, $7300 balance): $148.46 paid monthly
* Student loan 2 (2.33% interest rate, $1369 balance): $30 paid monthly

* Student loan 4 (6.8% interest rate, $4465 balance) $78.27 paid monthly
* Student loan 5 (6.8% interest rate, $3700 balance): $74.71 paid monthly

Accounts:
* Brokerage account with some tiny stock investments: $1200
* Savings accounts: $5500 total
* 401k: $13k balance, 7% monthly contribution (~$200), all sits in FDEEX right now

Currently sitting on partially vested ISOs from my current job that are a little more than 25% vested.  I've exercised ~40% of them, and plan to exercise the rest over the next year.  This will likely cause me a significant tax hit, so I'm also hoping to better plan for April 2016.  Expecting to pay $7k out of pocket in April for taxes related to exercising this year.  This will significantly deplete my savings.

Other expenses:

* Food: $50 weekly
* Gas: $50 monthly
* Savings: $1000-1300 monthly
* Car: paid off, but always tempted to sell my current vehicle and get a truck (I know that's not the right financial decision, though)

So, PF, what can I do to optimize?  Can I consolidate my loans and save some $ on interest payments?  Should I be using a different strategy to pay those off than simply paying the monthly minimum? Do vested and exercised ISOs pose offer financial advantages/leverage other than a hopefully bright financial future?

I graduated from university three years ago. I currently have a job on a one year contract.

I'm required to pay €165 a month for the next 14 years, but I'd like to speed up the process.

Given that I'm on an annual contract, part of my concern is that I may not have a job in a year, so I may need to keep savings, though I live in a European country with good social benefits so I do not necessarily require massive savings. At the same time I'd like to take a chunk out of the loan if possible, but I do not know what the best strategy for paying this back is.

Background:
1st year Medical resident with:
$152,372 direct unsubsidized fed loan 
$41,312 direct subsidized loan

-Both loans are consolidated at 6.75% (after direct deposit interest rate cut) and are due to begin repayment this month.

-Currently I'm in an IBR and mandatory minimum payments are $0 for the time being, as I was making no income and was not required to file taxes until I began my residency.  This will surely change after I file my taxes this year.  From speaking with my peers, it seems the minimum payments are ~430/mo, factoring in my current salary.

-My current salary is approx. 50k before taxes, will remain about the same for the next 3 years with minor increases (1-2k) each year.

-I contribute 6% pretax to a 403(b) plan through Fidelity that my employer matches.

-I am aware of the PSLF plan and plan on taking full advantage of the 10 year tax-free loan forgiveness if at all humanly possible.  The first 3 years are obviously covered, as I work for a hospital system…the next 7 will depend on where I end up practicing.  I have heard that I can work for a private group while putting in time with a public entity and still qualify, as long as I am receiving regular paychecks from them to prove I am full time, despite not technically working there full-time.

-Currently have about 8k in savings, rent is 700/mo, utilities 150/mo, no car payments, no CC debt.

-I have been getting paid for 6 months now, and am averaging ~1300 in savings (out of 2600 that I take home).  The rest goes towards rent, utilities, medical bills, exam/licensing costs, food, booze, etc.

-My questions are these:  
1. Should I put part of my current savings in a Vanguard-type Roth IRA to supplement the 403(B)?
2. Despite not having a minimum payment, should I still put money towards the loans?  (my guess is yes, although I'm not sure how much)
3. Should I be paying as much as I can towards the loans or just the minimum?
4. Are there any other options that I should look into, i.e. stocks, bonds, brothels?
4. Am I totally fucked?

Our total cost per year is $72k, so $40k is paid with scholarships/grants and the other $32k is through a federal loan. I had a full ride in undergrad, so tuition and housing were paid for, but all my other expenses came out of pocket.

I didn't have time to work while in undergrad and my parents make only $30k combined so I put a lot of my expenses on a credit card. This includes my MCAT preparation, course textbooks, my flights and hotels for interviews, my suit, groceries, and various other things. I have $6500 on a Wells Fargo credit card and $2000 on a Chase credit card.

My current student loan allows me to pay for housing, food, and my credit cards, but that's about it. I have very little money left over for clothes, hobbies, or even going out, which sucks. I study all the time and can't spend money on myself to be happy. But I don't know what to do. I assumed that because I didn't take the total $72k out in loans, that I could ask for more. But I can't. My loan is completely maxed out at $32k, $12k to tuition and $20k to housing.

My parents have been giving me $100 a month just because they want to help me, but I feel so bad taking it. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do. If I had $10k right now I would be so relieved. I don't care if it has to be on another loan with super high interest because I know I'll be able to pay it in the distant future.

personalfinance,How much should I have saved up by the time I move out?,"Hello PF!  So I am not in any financial trouble but am just looking for advice.  I am currently a graduate student and will be moving back home in May.  I will have a full time job making ~$25/hr.  Hourly is good in this case because it is auditing and between January and April we do a decent amount of overtime.  I have a total of about 90K in debt between student loans and a car payment (only about 4K of that) and 90% of that is to my parents.  I will begin paying them off in June at a 2.9% interest rate or whatever their HELOC rate is at the time since that is where the money came from.  I will not have many other expenses because we get reimbursed for mileage with my job with all the travel we do.

I guess my question isn't really specific to me, but that is just some background.  How much money do you feel is a good amount to have saved up by the time you move out to be on your own?  How much did you have saved up when you moved out and do you feel like it was enough or not enough?  I do not want to live extravagantly by any means.  I will make edits as questions arise.

personalfinance,Alternative to Springleaf for Personal Loan? Also: F*ck Springleaf,"I had to take a personal loan last year and unfortunately it is quite a high interest rate.  That being said I will have it paid off within the year.  My main issue with Springleaf and the reason I am asking this question is because their website is absolute shit.   There is no visibility of what your current balance is today or how much you owe today.  The ONLY way to get that information is to pick up the phone and call.  I have complained about this for the last 6 months and they dont do anything.  They say they are working on it but that is absolute bullshit.  They are lying.  As such I want absolutely nothing to do with this company any more.  So who are the alternatives?  

I actually started with One Main Financial and I liked them.  Their website is good and offers real time information.   The only reason I switched was because Springleaf offered me a better interest rate 25% vs 30%.     Fuck Springleaf though.   Dirty company who hides information to keep you from making good decisions.  I am absolutely 100% convinced that their website is designed to keep people from making payments on time so that an expensive late fee is triggered.  

So what are the alternatives?  Any companies out there with low closing costs?  I have a 675 credit score right now. I want to switch from Springleaf as soon as possible.

6/7 is in long term saving deposit (LTSD) at 10.5%

My goal is to have one year's worth of expenses in my savings account (twice my current net worth) so that when I get a job (IF I get a job; ~5 years from now) I can start saving immediately so that I can escape this insane inflation.

Bitcoin,"One of the major arguments against Bitcoin is the deflationary nature of the currency. The Federal Reserve says 2% inflation is best for ""price stability and maximum employment"" over the long term. Do you think an inflationary cryptocurrency would be better than Bitcoin? Further thoughts in text.","As I mentioned in the title, [The Federal Reserve](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm) thinks 2% inflation is best. But this is within the context of a debt based currency with fractional reserve lending. 

Debt free currencies, such as Bitcoin, have been known to work in the past. For instance, the American British Colonies issued [their own currencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency#Colonial_currency) and designated them ""legal tender for all debts public and private"". There was also [President Lincoln and his greenbacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenback_%28money%29).

There was often inflation with this monetary system, but the good thing about inflation is that it can favor the debtor over the creditor. 

The opposite is true with a deflationary currency. Deflationary economic depressions are often really bad. The Great Depression was a deflationary collapse. Granted this was under Federal Reserve Act and I believe was intentional on the part of the Fed. 

That being said, Bitcoin could present that same problem if it ever gets widespread adoption. If it skyrockets in value suddenly people are just going to stop spending money, thus reducing demand for goods and services and causing layoffs, etc. 

Under an inflationary currency, there's more pressure to spend or invest because the currency is losing value and you want to beat the inflation of your stored value in currency. 

So my thoughts on Bitcoin is that it's a good start for cryptocurrencies, but ultimately sovereign nations will need  their own national currencies that are at least slightly deflationary. I also think it's a good idea to use blockchain technology, but with the democratically elected government in control of the rate of inflation and limits set by the algorithm. The currency is part of the nation's constitution, and thus prohibits central banks and debt based currency. 

That's one potential future for Bitcoin and cyptocurrency, but I'm open to hearing other people's thoughts on why Bitcoin works as a deflationary currency with a high rate of adoption.",cryptocurrency,1418587764

At this point I don't have much faith in them getting the w2 stuff right, plus I'm far from thrilled about having to float them cash while I wait for a refund for several months because of their mistake.

I've offered to pay the net (that is, the amount that I actually received from them) now and the taxes once I'm refunded by the government, but so far I haven't managed to get them to agree to this.

Anyone have any experience with this? Am I being unreasonable? (I don't think I am...)

They could, but they won't. And since they will not get to it till next year they will then not be able to change the withholding as it will at that point be from a prior year. Also, they will issue me a w2 by the end of Jan, it will just be wrong. Once I have paid back the gross (and not before then) they will issue a w2c, which if I pay right this minute they may get to by early March.

I offered to pay the net now and then pay the taxes once I get refunded but they tell me that 1. they will send me to collections if I do this and 2. will not give me a w2c till they have the full amount (including taxes) so I'm SOL on getting a refund.",finance,1418590985

Background: 1st year Medical resident with: $152,372 direct unsubsidized fed loan $41,312 direct subsidized loan

-Both loans are consolidated at 6.75% (after direct deposit interest rate cut) and are due to begin repayment this month.

-Currently I'm in an IBR and mandatory minimum payments are $0 for the time being, as I was making no income and was not required to file taxes until I began my residency. This will surely change after I file my taxes this year. From speaking with my peers, it seems the minimum payments are ~430/mo, factoring in my current salary.

-My current salary as a resident is approx. 50k before taxes, will remain about the same for the next 3 years with minor increases (1-2k) each year.  

-I contribute 6% pretax to a 403(b) plan through Fidelity that my employer matches.

-I am aware of the PSLF plan and plan on taking full advantage of the 10 year tax-free loan forgiveness if at all humanly possible. The first 3 years are obviously covered, as I work for a hospital system…the next 7 will depend on where I end up practicing. I have heard that I can work for a private group while putting in time with a public entity and still qualify, as long as I am receiving regular paychecks from them to prove I am full time, despite not technically working there full-time.

-Currently have about 8k in savings, rent is 700/mo, utilities 150/mo, no car payments, no CC debt.

-I have been getting paid for 6 months now, and am averaging ~1300 in savings (out of 2600 that I take home). The rest goes towards rent, utilities, medical bills, exam/licensing costs, food, booze, etc.

-My questions are these:

1. Should I put part of my current savings in a Vanguard-type Roth IRA to supplement the 403(B)? 

2. Despite not having a minimum payment, should I still put money towards the loans? (my guess is yes, although I'm not sure how much)

3. Should I be paying as much as I can towards the loans or just the minimum? 

4. Are there any other options that I should look into, i.e. stocks, bonds, brothels? 

5. Am I totally fucked?

I have made up my mind to quit in a couple of months and travel the world for a bit.  Pay is pretty good, but the level of dedication is just too much.  I get almost no vacation time and the hours are horrible.

Some facts: My salary is 150K.  I have saved up in total about 300K, this includes everything in my 401K, IRA, brokerage account, and cash.  I have no debts at all, my credit cards are paid off every month.  I am 28 years old.  No SO or kids.  No other financial burden.  I work in finance.

My idea is to quit sometime early next year and travel for a year or so.  I just want to make sure I do it as financially responsibly as I can.

Here are a couple of questions:

- I max out my 401K every year.  If I quit early 2014, is there a way I can max out that contribution?  I already set to the highest contribution percentage I am allowed, but I doubt I can reach the limit.  Is there anything I can do?

- How does the 401K rollover work?  I am thinking of using schwab.  - Going to ask them in the next days.  I think I am allowed to keep it with my company even after Im gone.  Is this a good idea? or should I just roll it over?

- A few people in my family are suggesting I get a rental property to diversify my investments a bit and take advantage of the low interest rates.  Is this a good idea?  

- Is what I am doing stupid?  I am giving up 150K a year and a promising career to follow one of my life's goals.  Is it worth it?  Has anyone ever done something similar?  How hard is it to get a job after I get back?

- I want to conserve as much of my money as I can.  So to finance the trip, I plan on selling my car, and use that money to travel.  Once its gone, then Im done with travelling.  It should sell for about 25K I hope.  This should last me almost a year.

- I am looking at health insurance and all that already.  Is there anything I am forgetting?  Anything I should worry about?

- Also, any great places you guys recommend I visit?  Im thinking SE Asia, Japan, and South America.

personalfinance,Advice on paying off law school loans.,"Hello! 
I've been browsing on here for PF for quite some time. I've been unable to find specific advice for my situation so I was hoping someone could help me out. Essentially, I'm trying to determine whether my current strategy for paying off my student loan makes sense. I finished law school last semester, and started working in September. 

My current income is approximately 85-90k, US. I live in a Southern city and I'm 28, for what it's worth.  

My student debt, including both grad school and undergrad, is 89k. I do not have any other debt other than that. 

Since I've been in grad school, where I took on approximately 65k in debt, the loans and conditions of debt changed every year (grad plus loan). At the current moment, I'm going with a 20-year plan for the purpose of paying the minimum and attempting to pay off my higher-interest debt first. These loans are  7.9%, for approximately 10k. Others, are are lower interest rate. 

Now, I'm wondering whether it makes sense for me to do this 20 year plan to pay off the 7.9%, which only targets 10k, or should I just do the 10-year total pay off time, instead? My plan is to pay the same amount each year regardless of the plan I pick. (although, I'm only paying the 20-year minimum right now until I can save 4 months of living expenses first, which should be met by next month). 

I hope that made sense.... I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks!!",finance,1418618940

personalfinance,Found my dream car. Appears to be affordable. Keep me grounded pls.,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm very new to this sub (and also very new to the idea of managing my own finances).

Heres where I'm at:

* 23 yr old
* Recent college grad
* Gainfully employed as a ""marketing manager"" for a tech company
* Employed for ~6 months
* Gross income ~$58000, take home is ~ $3K a month after contributions to 401k
* Still have about ~$14k in student loans to pay off 

The other day I got into a minor car accident. While there were no injuries my radiator in my old '02 Nissan Altima is busted and would likely cost $500+ to replace. I do not want to put anymore money into the car so I decided to look at buying something new or lightly used.

By playing around with my personal finances spreadsheet I found that after rent, food, gym fees, etc I could reasonably afford to make a down payment of $4000 and then proceed to make monthly payments of up to $400. This would reduce my monthly ""set-aside"" savings to around $600 and my leftover ""flex spend money"" to around $370.

All of that in mind I went to my local Toyota dealership to see what they had in stock. There I found a certified used 2013 Scion FR-S (a car I've had my eyes on for a LONG time, probably since the first rumors of it's development surfaced) with ~16k miles for ~$22k. After giving the finance department some of my information I was told that with $4k down:

* I could get monthly payments of $370 over a period of 72 months which is within calculated range (even taking higher insurance payments into account)
* The interest rate would initially be about 7.69% but I would be able to re-finance to a lower rate after 9 months 
* The interest rate is relatively high and will be high through the dealership because I am a first time buyer

Now, this is literally the first quote that I've received in my first foray into buying a 'new' car, but it seems like it is affordable for me. I did talk to an aunt that worked for years in a credit union and she told me to see if I could get better rates at a credit union, which I will be checking out tomorrow. But even at a lower APR I'm still unsure weather or not that this car is manageable for me financially. The numbers seem to work out reasonably well and though my 'rainy day fund' will be depleted, it should revert back to normal levels in a few months of careful spending. The most difficult part emotionally is that this is a car that I've been fawning over for several years and the test drive only made it worse. 

Basically what I'm asking is if I'm missing anything in my analysis, and if I'm on the right track. I would really like to accept this deal it at all possible but I need reliable transportation fairly soon.

Any help or advice is welcome. Thanks!

I drive a 2001 Corolla with 275k miles that's in not great shape. It has a lot of cosmetic issues (which doesn't bother me, but it's probably only worth a couple hundred dollars to someone else), has some power issues, and is starting to make a scary sounding noise. It also needs new tires, which I know are just general maintenance, but it's hard to want to put a few hundred dollars into the car when that's all it is worth. I don't drive a whole lot, but I need to have a car. I feel like it does fine for getting around town, but for longer distance driving we will generally rent a car. Normally I wouldn't have a problem driving it until it dies, but my husband and I are expecting our first child in February and I'm worried about carrying a baby around in a car I don't necessarily trust. However, it has needed zero expensive repairs in the 8 years I've owned it, and I hate to give up something with a track record like that.

I've looked around at some dealerships, and I think I can find what I'm looking for (2006ish Camry or Avalon) for around $7k-$9k. I've spoken to my credit union and it sounds like we would be approved for a $10k loan at around an 8% interest rate. I would also need to get full coverage insurance, and I'm not really sure how much that would be. Right now we pay $80/month for coverage on my car and my husband's '94 Pathfinder. We have had some serious credit issues in the past that we are in the process of getting cleaned up, so we're kind of lucky to get approved for anything. 

I don't work right now and won't return to work after the baby is born, but my husband's take home pay every month is $6300 (after health insurance and 401k). Our monthly expenses are around $3450, however we don't have very much in savings, around $3500, because we've been aggressively paying down collections accounts and student loan debt (around $30k left). 

I feel like we could definitely afford to finance a car, but I'm having a hard time figuring out whether it's a good idea or not. When I think about hanging onto what I have, I feel like an idiot for putting money into something that has so little value, but when I think about getting something newer, I feel like an idiot for taking on more debt, needing to pay interest, and paying more for insurance. If we didn't have this baby deadline then I would want to save up and just buy something in cash, but unfortunately that's not going to happen in the next couple of months.

While this lower LocalBitcoin RUB volume might seem counter-logic at first, it actually follows the same pattern of seen in LocalBitcoins during the Cyprus bank-run that caused Bitcoin's appreciation in April-May 2013. IMHO, the reason for the declining volume is the notion by the Bitcoin sellers that in a sinking ship you do not sell your life-jacket... hence the HODL their Bitcoin and as a result, volume is lower.

My issue is between the theft and correction of my credit, I took out a private student loan. I received a rather high interest rate on the load. As a victim of identity theft, I am entitled to correct any damages, so I called the bank and explained to them my situation.

personalfinance,Utilizing college loans for another purpose,"Before everyone tells me (29M) I'm nuts, let me provide a little background. I am a veteran student, utilizing the Post 9/11 GI Bill to finish my undergrad (this spring) and complete my masters (next fall). I have a very small amount of college loan debt from being in college before the military (less than 10K, which I am actively paying off). I applied for financial aid this year, in the hope of receiving Pell Grants (for all intents - free money). I did, and used them to pay down my current college loan debt ($4700 towards it!). 

I have been thinking of purchasing a motorcycle for years now. I had one until I was 23 and sold it when I joined the army. I have looked into financing a new bike as well as saving to buy a used one. I can afford to finance and pay monthly (6% @ 120 per month), which I know is pretty good. However, saving is difficult in that I have a fixed income (monthly living stipend). If I took the same amount of the potential payment ($125) and put it away, it would take me almost 3 years to save enough to buy a similar used bike. 

Here is my thought. By applying for financial aid, $4600 per semester in subsidized federal loans became available to me. The GI Bill pays for school, so I have no need for it an have declined it. This  coming semester is my last a an undergrad and the last time I will have access to loans like this (very effing low interest rate). I was thinking of accepting roughly $3000 in the loan (can decide how much/little) I want, combining it with the $2600 I will get in grants, and utilize this to buy a good used motorcycle. I have spoken to the school and it is not uncommon for vets in my position to utilize some college loans to help pay for additional expenses. In this case, I am looking at it as 6% interest vs 3ish%, only $3000 of which I even need to pay back. I am trying to get some input as to whether or not I am just lucky to be able to utilize this or if I'm just a big dumb idiot for even considering it.

personalfinance,I need some advice. What are my options here?,"I just transferred from Liberty University Online to Baker College, which is technically a trade school. I am trying to get my Automotive Service certificate. However, after this week, I will have approximately $120 to work with, if I don't spend anything. Going to Baker is about a 40 minute commute each way, so that certainly won't last long, especially with debt I already owe in taxes to Michigan and Federal taxes.

I have applied at a lot of jobs (except fast food, after working at a camp, that's just something I want to avoid altogether), and followed up on a lot of jobs. I mostly got scolded because they would call me if they wanted to hire me, and other times people told me they would call back soon, but never heard from them ever again.

At this point, I feel like my only option here is factory work, which I feel will inevitably mess with my career training, and eventually I won't be able to complete it.

That said, I'm not sure what to do here about a job. I need money to get to and from school, and I've had some really restless nights over the tax money I owe for 2013. I'm starting to feel depressed, like I can't get out of this black hole.

personalfinance,Which card to pay down first (somewhat unique situation)?,"Ok, maybe not unique, but different from the typical. I'm a math-savvy guy (understand how compound interest etc works), been on PF for over a year now, and I know mathematically the cheapest/best way is to pay down the highest interest rate card first. My situation is a little muddy, and I need some help to figure out how to best look at things. 

I have 2 credit cards with outstanding balances. Card 1 has a larger balance and a lower interest rate (~$7k @ 9.9%). Card 2 is where it gets complicated. I have about $3500 on that card, but it is at an introductory 0% rate for the next 3 months, at which point it jumps to 14.99%. What I have been doing is paying off Card 1, since it's 9.9% is much higher than the (currently) 0% on Card 2. The other day I started thinking though, should I be paying off Card 2? Since its interest rate will be so much higher than Card 1 (when it kicks in), should I be paying down that card? I could potentially have that card paid off in full before the introductory period is over if I diverted all my payments (except from minimum) from Card 1 to Card 2. Or is it better to keep paying Card 1 (which is currently racking up interest) and only switch to Card 2 when it's introductory period is over?  Am I over-complicating this? I know I could put together a spread sheet comparing the two methods and see overall cost of one vs the other, but I was hoping someone else has already gone through this and can give me the cheapest way to do this. Thanks!!

EDIT:

Well I went ahead and crunched the numbers. I compared a few different options:

* Option 1: Paying off Card 1 first, then progressing to Card 2 once it's 0% rate jumps up to 14.99 (then back to card 1 when card is paid off)
* Option 2: Paying off Card 2 first then paying off Card 1
* Option 3: Transfer most of Card 1 to another card (details below), then pay Card 1 first
* Option 4: Transfer most of Card 1 to another card, then pay Card 2 first

Between Options 1 &amp; 2, Option 1 would be the cheapest, save me about $140 over Option 2. However, in another comment, /U/KnightLionWave and /u/SamDanger got me thinking about balance transfers. I have another card which currently has a $0 balance and a limit of $6k (calling it Card 3). They are currently offering a balance xfer with a 2% fee and 0% APR through next November. I ran the numbers for transferring as much of the balance from Card 1 as possible to Card 3, then paying either Card 1 or Card 2 first. This option was the best by far... doing the balance transfer saves me about $630 compared to the non-transfer options, with Option 3 being the cheapest (about $140 cheaper than Option 4, as expected based on the comparison of Option 1 and Option 2).

Sorry, I know this has all been terribly confusing, and I answered my own question, but you guys have been helpful as a sounding board, and special thanks to the users mentioned above for getting me to look at balance transfers (I'd like to say it would have occurred to me eventually, but who knows).

I am fairly to very handy and have done or am willing to do any work besides electrical and structural. The house does not currently have a furnace (but does have all hookups and air returns), and it looks like possible water damage in the basement.

I have several student loans that total to $36k, with low interest rates (everything between 2-6%). This is my only debt, and minimum combined payments on my loans are $660. I have no difficulties in making these loan payments.

With my current housing situation, expenses, and minimum loan payments, $8,500 is easily a 6 month emergency fund. I don't expect my housing situation to change, but if it did and I needed to move or have my own apartment, $8,500 would be cutting it close for 6 months.

- Finally information is given on the phone the day I leave to move into the dorms - application is very late. I am 17 years old - do not know what Parent PLUS loans and asked for all loan types when I filled out their forms.  Do not receive any money until late fall since application was so late, school constanly sending me letters about a possible default.

- This occurs all 3 years of college - yes, I got a degree in that time - and my brother also gets his information this way. We would fill them out together with the piecemeal information we would get from them.

-After I graduate, mom calls me yelling saying that it's my fault the loans were put in her/my step-dad's name - so my brother and I will need to pay them ourselves. I understand that I should have read closer, but I was very young and had absolutely no idea what I was doing. (Imagine that!)

- I am actually fine with this, I would rather pay them off then have to be tied to them financially at this point of my life. (23f) Small problem - they get a tax break if I pay them off, not me who actually needs it since I make significantly less as a single person who doesn't have a joint tax return. The tax break is also dependent on the amount of money you make.

- The loans are currently on a forbearance until February while I could figure out a plan and also pay off some different loans in the mean time. 

-Basic Question: I am desperately trying to not be tied to be mom/step-father financially - I need to figure out to pay these loans myself, but also get the tax break that I deserve.

1. Somehow convince a private bank/lender to grant me a student loan for the amount of money my parents need to pay of the Federal PLUS loan (about $25k) I can then pay off the private loan and get a credit that way.

I've been lurking around here for the last few months and have learned a ton. It's also been a big inspiration to get my finances together. Whenever I think about buying something I come here and read about the guy who already did it and how it was a terrible choice :) So many thanks to everyone for that.

Anyway I have a couple questions for you guys. I'm planning on buying a new car some time around April or May and I'm currently working on straightening out all of my finances and debt as well as saving up a down payment so when I buy a car I can get the best deal I can find. When I first got a decent job after years of working minimum wage I opened various credit accounts and bought a bunch of crap, never by any means got myself under water or anything but definitely did some useless spending. Pretty much got that all taken care of.

Here's what I've got:  

I make 2600 a month after taxes. I split a house with four roommates so my living expenses are pretty low. About $1100 a month and that's living pretty comfortably.

Debt:

BofA Card -        $0   $700 limit.  
Citi Card -          $0   $1000 limit. (I use this one for rewards and pay it off each month)  
Best Buy -       ~$1200   $3000 limit. (In deferred interest)  
Amazon -         ~$850     $1800 limit. (In deferred interest)  
Paypal Credit -   $0        $1600 limit. (This doesn't show up on credit report for some reason)  
RC Willey -        $0         $2000 limit.


Student Loans ~$4300   $6200 original balance.  


I will have Amazon and Bestbuy paid off by the end of January. So regarding the revolving accounts should I close any of those or is it better to leave them open? I don't want to close the BofA card because it is by far my oldest account. They offered it to me when I turned 18 and against my mothers protests I went ahead and got it. One of the better choices I've made as far as credit goes.

Should I ask for increases on any of these accounts? I've read that available credit is taken into account in your credit score.

My main question is about the student loans. I can have these paid off by the end of February but I'm wondering if I should. Those are the only installment loans I have ever had and I'm not sure if it would actually lower my score to only have revolving accounts? Would I better paying about $3000 on them, buying the car, and then pay them off? How would that affect me?

I'm looking at spending 8k-12k on a car. I want to have at least a $4000 down payment. I don't really need the car so I may wait longer and save more if I can't find the right deal. I have a 94 ranger that gets me around just fine but I don't trust it much on longer drives on top of it being incredibly uncomfortable and I'd really like to have something nicer to drive around town and have the ability to go on longer trips to visit friends that moved, family, etc.

I'll have a pretty decent chunk of my monthly income(~$1000) to throw at the car once I get it so could likely pay it off in less than a year but it seems like the general consensus around here is if the interest rate is low enough that it's better to use the money somewhere else. I don't currently have any investments or retirement accounts(employer doesn't offer 401k so I'm not missing the match or anything) so do you think I would be better just paying what I have to on the car and putting my extra cash into a Roth IRA or maybe an index fund? I do want to increase my emergency fund a bit, I've got $3500 in there now, so I think that will be priority over paying off the car for a while.

So anyway that's where I'm at and my plan. What do you guys think as far as paying off the student loans and what to do about the revolving accounts or any other general advice you guys have. Thanks a lot.

Looking at studentloans.gov's loan calculator it appears that the payments should be 15% of the difference between 150% of the poverty line for your state and family and your AGI. For last year's taxes that would be $0/month so they must have somehow based the payment off my pay stubs. 

I started running the approximate numbers for my taxes next year and my AGI will probably be about 38K (I'm a single mom) so based on that: 

38K- 23.5 (150% poverty level) x .15 = $2,175 a year or about $181/mth. 

Am I missing something? I don't really understand why I've been paying $300 a month currently. I'm a federal employee so I'll be applying to PSLF and so it's in my best interest to pay as little as possible. Can I get them to lower my payments after I file taxes or even now? If anyone has dealt with adjusting payments before the annual adjustment I'd love to hear your advice.",finance,1418693257

personalfinance,25 year old waiter with 47k in private student loans and 36k in federal. Is my payment plan logical?,"First a little about my situation, then a breakdown of all the numbers.

-----

I'm 25 with a mountain of student loan debt. Got a creative writing degree from a good school and am pursuing my career as a filmmaker, but besides a few occasional online commercials and a little bit of Youtube ad revenue from my first feature, I don't really make any money from it yet. I'm trying to change that in 2015 by regularly entering video contests and trying to get representation as a commercial director, but for now I pay all my bills by working as a waiter. I have two serving jobs, and work usually 7-8 shifts a week between them for around a 30hr work week. 

-

I've never missed a payment on anything and have been slowly building my credit since graduating college. I just want to know if my current repayment plan is logical considering my circumstances, and what to do if my circumstances change for the better in coming years.

An outline of my private loans:

Current Total $47,470.03

LOAN A
@ 8.000%
Original Amount $5,000.00
Current Balance $5,847.21

LOAN B
@ 6.750%
Original Amount $24,000.00
Current Balance $28,750.04

LOAN C
@ 7.000%
Original Amount $12,000.00
Current Balance $12,872.78

The monthly payment on these is $470. I always pay $500, mainly just in case there's an emergency so I can get away without paying a month (by now I'm paid ahead by a month). 

I'm not sure how my money is distributed to these three loans when I make a payment. I am not even aware if there is a way to pay these loans individually, as I don't see an option for it on the website (MyGreatLakes).

Here's an outline of my federal loans:

LOAN D  Subsidized  @ 5.375%  Current Balance $20,818.98

LOAN E  Unsubsidized  @ 5.375%  Current Balance $15,637.40

These are both under the Pay As You Earn (Partial Financial Hardship) repayment plan. I figured this was best because the private loans are the bigger issue, and I certainly can't afford to make full payments on these AND the private loans. My payments are always $0/month under Pay As You Earn because my income has been so low the past couple of years. 

My AGI last year was $17k, but I can't find my gross. No idea how much I actually made last year since I switched jobs a lot, but I would guess around 26k (a good chunk of which was unreported cash tips).

I made significantly more money this year (some paid online video gigs and working more) and worry that I may need to start making payments on the federal loans next year. 

Now I make about 2.5k/month total from my servings jobs, though it varies based on my tips. On paper I probably make a bit under 2k/month.

I guess I should also include my car loan info:

LOAN F  @ 6%  Current Balance - roughly $4k  

$200/mo payments


----

My monthly expenses are:

Rent - 575

Utilities - 75

Car payment - 200

Car insurance - 100 (only liability and roadside assistance)

Gasoline - 125

Food - 500 (mostly groceries, but still a lot I know...)

Gym membership - 25

Private loan payments - 500
----

Total: $2,100

-

Add in all the unexpected expenses that come up every month and I usually scrape by with anywhere between $0 and $400 leftover at the end of the month, which I inevitably waste. I think this problem of mine will be easier to remedy if I had some understanding of where best to put it.

I've never been able to maintain more than $1k savings, which is what I have now. My parents are broke and cannot help me in an emergency, although I do have a brother with money if there's a big crisis. 

I may be able to win some money this year through video contests if all goes to plan (I did well last year with very minimal effort in this arena). If I win $5k in a contest, what would be the best use of this money? $10k?

Thank you!",finance,1418699405
