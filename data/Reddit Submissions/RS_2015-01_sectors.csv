I financed a truck for 27k. Long story short, I'm paying $600 a month. The payment is more than affordable for me, although I'm rocking a 16% interest rate. Can anyone out there advise me on what I need to do to drop that monthly payment along with the interest rate? BTW, my credit is shit although I have been building it up with secured credit cards and on-time car payments the last 6 months. Thanks!",finance,1420075302
personalfinance,"Recently promoted, could use advice to start 2015 off right!","I was recently promoted at my company and am attempting to get my finances in order for the next step in my life. I’ve always been pretty good about living within my means and saving money, but I realize after spending a bit of time on this sub over the past week that I am not saving intelligently. I think I've got an idea of where to go based on the info that I've seen here, but some feedback would be great.


Personal Info:

* Late-twenties single male living in Columbus, Ohio. Not dating, no dependents.

* Finished a B.A., managed to pay it off shortly after graduation because I never bought myself anything and lived with my parents for all of college.



Financials:

* New salary is $50,000 a year, still overtime eligible. Was previously $32,000.

* $22,500 in Savings (very low interest rate, making almost nothing from it)

* Two credit cards: Chase Freedom card with a $6,000 limit, currently only using about $200. Best Buy card through Citibank with a $3,500 limit that I almost never use, currently at $0.

* My company offers 5% 401k match and a pension. I am putting in 5%. I’ve been at this company for a bit over two tears. 401k is at $4,500 and pension is at about $1,500.

* My credit score was approximated at 750, but I’ll talk about this more in a bit.

* I’ve never missed a payment on any of my debts.



Debts/Monthly Payments:

* My only debt is my car. I currently owe $13,500 on it and pay about $320 a month. 1.9% interest.

* I live with my roommate until the middle on 2015. My rent is $430 a month and utilities are about $90.

* I live less than 5 miles from work, so gas is only about $40 a month given the current low cost of gas and the fuel efficiency of my car.

* Phone bill is about $65 a month, car insurance and renters insurance bundled are about $80.

* Health/dental/vision insurance is through my employer and will cost me roughly $100 a month starting in 2015. 

* I probably spend between $150-200 a month on groceries, but I have a penchant for fast food and waste a lot of money eating out. Planning on cooking more this year.


My credit score is pretty good because I paid off my college loan shortly after graduation. However, I somewhat screwed myself here as I never built any credit history. My dad had to cosign for my car loan, but does not make payments on it. I bought this car about a year ago. 



Current plan:

* Open a Roth IRA and move over money from my savings account; will likely contribute the max amount for 2014 if I still can.

* Increase contribution amount to 401k; not yet sure how much to increase by.

* Find a higher yield savings account as I am making nothing on my current savings.

* Get my savings back up to cover 6 months and put any additional unused funds into a mutual account

* Current credit card is still at 0% APR for a few months, so I’m thinking about opening another at another bank to get another year of 0% APR (even though I typically do not need it). May also call bank and ask for a limit increase due to promotion.



I would like to pay off my car so I am debt free, but I’m worried about running into the credit history issue again if I do this. Should I just start paying more a month instead of paying it off completely, or would it be okay to pay off? I was thinking about upping my payments to $500 a month and then paying it off when it’s at $10,000, but I don’t know if this is a bad idea.


Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",finance,1420078133
personalfinance,Me and my girlfriend both have a lot of debt. We are both terrible with our finances are are just paying the minimums on most things. What's the best way for us to get in a position where we can actually start saving for a house from where we are at. Is debt consolidation an option?,"I met my girlfriend a while back and we are now at the point in our relationship where we really want to move in together and find a house.  We both commute so much between each other's houses which we are both just renting space in from our parents and we love each other and want to spend our lives together in our own place.

Right now, I have a car payment for my brand new 2012 car, a mattress payment for our new mattress, and an outstanding medical bill for $700 that needs to get paid.  I am also an ""independent contractor"" (aka my company won't actually hire me) and am terrible at saving for taxes, so the next few months will be spent putting all my spare cash away so I can pay my $8000 or so in taxes that I'll need to have by then.  Thankfully, I have a good job and make decent money and I'm hoping to even get a raise this year that might help.

My girlfriend is a lot worse off.  She has her car payment as well, but she also has a ton of student loan debt, $2000 in credit card debt from a grant that didn't come through in college and another $700 in credit card debt from her actual credit card that she uses.  Her job isn't nearly as nice as mine and she's lucky to make the minimum payments she needs and still be able to afford food and gas.

I want to help her pay her bills, she wants to help me pay mine, we just want to do things in the best way we can.  She was talking about consolidating all of her loans and being able to pay one payment with the same or lower interest than what she is paying on everything individually.  I know nothing about this, but is that an option and if so how would we go about looking into that?

Basically, I feel entirely unorganized because since I got my (relatively) high paying job I've just been living it up and not paying attention like I should be.  I went from being disabled and unemployed and living off $500 a month (95% of which went to rent and food) to making $3000 a month and just buying whatever I want and barely even keeping track.  Going out, buying gifts, buying things for me...it's been great and I'm not drowning by any means but if I keep going this way I'm going to be living with my parents paying rent forever and so is she and that's just not gonna fly!

Anyone with any advice for us going into the new year we would both by very appreciative.  We are reading through the FAQ and sidebar now and making lists in Workflowy but any personalized advice to our situation would be amazing.

Happy New Year everyone!

investing,My strategy/outlook for 2015. What's yours?,"I expect a substantial pullback in the US market and USD, and for commodities and foreign markets to rebound. 

* Much of the fundamental data on the US economy is still abysmal - personal and national debt in the stratosphere and growing, terrible trade deficits, weak employment data.

* The phantom USD strength will wan. This dollar surge has been due to the expectation that the Fed will raise rates sometime soon, and that Mario Draghi will implement QE in Europe. Neither of these events has transpired, and once the markets understand that the Fed cannot afford to raise rates there will be a USD sell-off, which will lead to...

* Commodity prices will turn around. Hard-assets took a beating in Q3 and Q4 as investors anticipated the Fed raising rates, but once the market realizes that the economy is too weak to handle a rate-hike commodity prices will rise. 

* Investors will look to foreign markets for high returns in 2015. If you weren't able to reach into the US market during the last several years and get a piece of this bull market then you've missed your chance. The DOW was hitting new all-time highs on a weekly basis in Q4. If you buy now, you're buying the top. Even without all the pressure of the horrid fundamentals, the US market is due for a cyclical correction. 

* In addition, very quietly several foreign exchanges have had great years. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SHCOMP) was up over 50%. The Ho Chi Minhi Stock Exchange in Vietnam was up 18%. The Egyptian Exchange is up over 30%. The S&amp;P is not the only game in town and investors will look abroad to get out of harms way in 2015.

I'm here for more stupid financial questions, so bear with me.

I'm applying for the 2015-2016 FAFSA at the moment, and the strangest thing is happening. I am moving from Texas to Oklahoma. Since getting grants from the FAFSA in Texas for a few years, it always has a question that says:

""Do you want to skip questions about your assets?"" To which, I happily always put yes. I don't work due to a medical issue at the moment, and haven't for a while and just attend school full-time. I will hopefully work soon, but have always just put that I want to skip.

Recently, however, filling out the FAFSA for Oklahoma and putting an Oklahoma address there instead of a Texas address, it is not letting me skip this question, instead forcing me to tell them the total of my bank account stuff, to which annoys me as it was just what my grandma left me for school and school alone ( plus I just make no income and it's for my living expenses etc.)

So why am I able to skip this in Texas, but NOT in Oklahoma? This is a federal form, is it not?

And my next question: If I claimed on the form that I live in my Texas address still ( which I still haven't moved from by the way ) and went to online classes at this Oklahoma school, is that technically ""lying?"" This is the only way I know that you could dodge that asset question, but it's confusing how it only pops up to skip for Texas ( yay Texas).

Thanks all and sorry if this is confusing. Keep in mind I'm still learning my way around Reddit, so sorry if replies are a bit delayed and I will try my best to keep on this.",finance,1420100385

More information:

To qualify:

&gt; You want to start saving for retirement, You're a wage earner without access to a retirement plan at work, and You earn less than $129,000 per year (less than $191,000 per year if you’re a married couple filing jointly) 

Interest:

&gt; This money will grow risk-free, earning interest. 

&gt; The investment is backed by the United States Treasury

&gt; myRA earns interest at the same rate as investments in the government securities fund available to federal employees. 

&gt; This calculator is for demonstration purposes only and does not indicate actual performance. It is based on an assumed average 2.5% interest rate, compounded monthly

Limitations:

&gt; You can keep saving money in your myRA for 30 years or until you’ve saved $15,000, and when either of those limits is reached, your savings will be rolled over to a private-sector Roth IRA* where you can keep saving.

We have an option to receive it in cash and have taxes withheld or put it in to the 401k. The company will not match the 401k contribution if that's where you elect for it to go. 


I'm not at risk of maxing out my 401k for 2015, even if I elect for all $7500 to go to the 401k, based on my salary.


Ordinarily,I would consider this a no-brainer and simply 401k all of it and forget about it, but I have a baby on the way and since this is, in effect, my raises for the next few years,I was considering keeping some of it in cash. Any suggestions would be welcome.


EDIT: I could also take it in cash and put it in my Roth ira, but that seems silly because I'd still get taxed on it. We do have an emergency fund, so the cash won't do us any good there with interest rates so low. No real debt to speak of, either.

personalfinance,"Start paying down mortgage now or buy a parking space, a car and enjoy life a little? (UK)","Ok so I'm 22, girlfriend is 24 we've had a shared ownership mortgage together for 8 months, we own 30% of the 1 bed flat we live in and the outstanding mortgage balance is £61,000. We live in London, thus the incredibly high cost of property, but the value of the flat has increased by around 18% since purchase. Fixed interest rate of 4.79% for the next 4 years and 4 months is probably also worth a mention. We see a combined pre-tax income of £54,000 per year and have no debts other than the mortgage. Our monthly expenses come in at around £1600 so between us we are able to save a good chunk of money each month (around £350 each) and still have a good amount of disposable income as well. We also both see a minimum of £2000 each (after-tax) in work related bonus' each year.

We'd like to buy a car, but this would involve purchasing a parking space in the secure underground car park on our complex, with a current asking price of £20,000 (again, London). We'd also like to get out and see the world a little more. If we were to focus on the parking space and begin to save towards it, there is the added bonus of being able to rent it out should we move at some point further down the line. The idea would be to save £10,000 or more which is definitely within reach, take out a bank loan to cover the other £10,000 and then rent the space to cover the bulk of the bank loan while saving for a car.

So I guess the question here is, Should we be looking to pay down our mortgage on the 30% share of the flat we live in as a priority, or can we loosen up and enjoy ourselves a bit? Go on holiday once or twice a year, get a car and worry about the mortgage in a few years time when we'll likely be earning more anyway?

Hoping you can help me how to best resolve this personal problem: I have a very bad, if non-existent, relationship with my mother and family. So much that the past year and a half we have not spoken. She - along with the rest of my family - was always very controlling, disrespectful, and narcissistic and just recently I've cut off most contact with her and the rest of my family.


Before I had the realization, we had an ok relationship - and she decided to help me go through college (she lives in a US territory and I moved to IL to go to school). I worked to get as many scholarships and federal loans I could, and she decided to borrow the shortfall with PLUS loans (roughly $60K, for all 4 years).


I ended up borrowing myself about $22K by the time I graduated in 2010, and I should be done with the last bit by the end of this year. My mother has been trying to manipulate me into giving her money ""to make ends meet"" but I know for a fact she has gambling issues, and along with my father have horrible money management skills (example: their house was paid off in 2006, but they got a second mortgage to pay off 3 car loans my father had).


I'm going back to where I grew up one last time before I am done completely with the relationship and I feel that my obligation with them, if any, is the repayment of my student debt. Is there any way I can access the PLUS loan info without having to talk to this woman?

Everyone who follows the rules and posts something in a give away (i.e. meets the giveaway criteria) expects to get the giveaway tip/amount right? Is it also fair to say that most shibes LIKE to get tipped? Well, I like to give tips AND get tips. Recently when I've seen some decent giveaway amounts (like Ð200+) I've participated.. however I've ALSO tipped the submitter. I like it, it's rewarding the person for even DOING the giveaway, and it spreads tipping culture further. I dig it.

What's funny is that in several of the giveaways the submitter then doesn't tip me.. it's like they are mutually exclusive in their eyes.. I can't tip you if you tipped me. It's actually laughable if you think about it.

So, even though I think New Years resolutions are dumb, I submit: I will attempt to tip the submitter in any decent giveaway threads (as I can afford/tipbot allows) in this 2015 year. I'd encourage others to do the same because hot damn it would be cool to see all that tipping. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of giveaways in general, but I love to 'break' the giveaway when I do all the necessary things to meet the giveaway rules, AND tip, and the submitter is all effed up and doesn't tip. Then I WIN, muhahaha.. or something. :)

I won't be running any giveaways personally because I don't have enough time. I still maintain that if someone makes a giveaway bot (where I can post a giveaway, let comments accumulate, and then come back later and invoke the bot to tip everyone an amount based on the total I tip), I totally WOULD run giveaways. Maybe an offshoot project for +/u/mohland and +/u/dvorwak ? I'd imagine syntax something like [plus]/u/dogetip.bot splash Ð10000 verify... then it reads the tip, runs a script to rake all the usernames/comments in the thread, then splashes all the users commented in the thread with 10k/# of users.

What I don't understand is why people pay off very low-interest debt so quickly. My friend took out a $20k loan to buy a car at around 1%, then he paid off the whole thing in less than three months. 

I haven't yet seen a rational argument for doing this. Here are the common arguments and why they're wrong.

1. It's annoying to make payments  
For most debts, you can automate the payments.

2. What if something happens and you lose your ability to pay the debt?  
Invest your money in something fairly liquid. If you ever run into the need to pay off the debt immediately, simply liquidate your investment and pay the debt.

3. It's stressful to carry debt/It's peace of mind to be debt free  
If your payments are automated, and you have your cash in a safe, liquid investment, there is really nothing to worry about.  

4. The stress of carrying debt is not worth the small amount of interest I'd earn from investing the money instead  
If you're carrying debt at 1% and put your money into a 6% investment, you're earning an extra 5% on your money. Even on a sum as low as $20k, that's $1k per year. That's a lot of money.

I mean, you're free to handle your finances how you want. But at least admit that you're being irrational when you rush to pay off that 1% debt.",finance,1420159028
personalfinance,Questions about college funding (Oregon).,"I'm currently a sophomore at a university in Oregon. When I started in 2013, my parents were making about 30k less per year than they are now. I had a lot of help through federal grants and scholarships, including an Out-of-state opportunity grant that prevents me from gaining Oregon residency. This year I got significantly (~8500) less in grants, but still had the scholarship. Now, according to the current FAFSA, I'm only eligible for loans. These won't be nearly enough to cover my tuition. So far I have 7k in debt through federal loans, but no other debt. 

I'm also currently unemployed and living with my SO, but had a minimum wage job for 6 months of 2014. I made about 2700 total, but most of it went to taxes. 

My main issue is that my parents now make over the ""financial need"" threshold, but both have ~90k in debt each. This meant i lost the scholarship, as it was need-based. I am receiving a bit 100/month in assistance but no more. Tuition is about 8400 per term. Is there anything I do besides private loans? I've seen so many horror stories. Should I get another job full-time and break from school? Part-time employment is already going to be a thing.

personalfinance,How should I withhold when anticipating a bonus?,"I was fortunate to get a new job starting tomorrow and I've been filling out paperwork, but I'm confused how to figure taxes for a bonus. I was told I'd receive a bonus worth 40-80% of my gross income all coming in the March of the following year (e.g. I'd get a 2015 bonus in 3/2016 and file it with my 2015 income). I know there is a penalty if I don't withhold enough in taxes, so I'm trying to figure out how I should do my withholding to compensate.

To add complexity, I'm planning to itemize as I will have mortgage interest and state income tax (5%) to deduct, which comes out to roughly double single standard deduction for 2015.

When I did the IRS withholding calculator, I found that I should do 0 allowances and withhold extra to account for the bonus. So I should probably do what the IRS calculator says to avoid tax.

If I get the low end bonus, I'd have a $12,675 fed income tax burden. If I get high end, I'll have like $18k tax burden. My budget is pretty tight so it would be nice to not withhold a ton extra, but my current thinking is that I should plan to withhold the highest amount to avoid the penalty (I don't even know what the penalty is.. is it that bad?).

How should I go about figuring out what to withhold from my paychecks? I'm confused because I know taxes will be withheld from my bonus too.. so do I need to do anything special?

personalfinance,Can/should I use an inherited 401K to pay off credit card debt?,"Hello and Happy New Year!  I'm very hopeful that I can get some solid advice from this subreddit and start my year off on the right foot.

I inherited a 401K when my mother died about 4.5 years ago.  She was employed by a bank at the time of her death and 90% of the 401K is composed of that bank's stock.  The stock price was destroyed during the recession and the account was worth about $16,000 when I inherited it.  The bank's stock has steadily increased in value, and the 401K balance in now just over $40,000.

I'm in a bad situation financially, with about $33,000 in credit card debt - some of it a high interest rate.  I'm determined to gain control of my finances this year, and I was considering using some of this 401K to pay off the highest interest credit card balances.

What do you all think?

I have this fantasy that the bank will be acquired by one of the big ones, like Wells Fargo or BOA, and the stock will be worth even more money.  I don't know, though, if that's just wishful thinking on my part.

I also don't have sense of the rules for inherited 401K accounts and if loans are even possible in this situation.

Some details about me:

* My gross salary is approximately $105,000 per year.
* My take home pay per month is approximately $5,000.
* My basic expenses (mortgage, HOA dues, car payment, insurance, etc.) run me approximately $3,500 per month.

My family rang the bell on it stating that it was a higher payment than it should be. I am paying $259 (for 6 years at a 10% interest rate) making an income of $14,400 a year (base $1,200 a month). The financed amount was at $13,900. How do I find out how much the dealership reported? How deep in S*** am I?

Update 1: I spoke to the bank. The dealership said I make $2,695 a month/32,000 a year. That is a lie. MY monthly income at its lowest is $1200-$1300. A year, $15000. I only make enough to support myself comfortably. The bank said there was nothing they could do and I would have to speak with the dealership. Guess where I'm headed?

Update 2: After visiting the dealer, the man that wrote the papers states I signed for that income. Wouldn't show me where I signed or produce papers showing I signed at that income. Never asked me for a pay stub during financing and states he gave me the best deal possible but I should have read the papers he wrote. I explained to him that he threw one paper after another and didnt give me a chance to read them to which he replied ""I dont have all day to read that to you, I had other things to do"" I shit you not. plus i was the only person there during signing.He kept changing the conversation from the wrongly put monthly income to me signing some paper that doesn't exist. He kept stating its a great deal and doesn't understand why I have a problem with it.

Does this count as saving? 

My problem is: every time I work with my company is usually in a different country and after every project we have the opportunity to stay in those countries, in other words, you can visit the country for less than 200 dollars per week...

personalfinance,Credit Cards and Car advice - cutting costs,"Hello PF! 

I’m hoping from some advice on two specific things – getting into a cheaper car, and getting rid of our CC debt. 

A bit of background. 
- Late 20’s

- Wife just finished grad school and makes 80k, her salary will continue to increase by 2-5k a year

- I committed professional suicide and went back to school, and have a part time job making 700/month

- We have taken a good look at our expenses and cut any extraneous ones down, with two main issues remaining

- Want to start looking at houses in the next year or two, but worry our credit scores will hold us back

- Current scores are ~650 and ~690

OK – issue one! The car. I bought a car for $20,000 a few years ago and the monthly payment on it is $350. I still owe $10,700 on it, and could likely sell it for $12,500 or so. Since I can’t get much cash out of the car, I’m not seeing very many ways to get into something less expensive that is still reliable (need to have that for school.) I’ve looked into leasing, but from what I gather that is a relatively expensive way to drive a vehicle. Would love any tips. This is one of the few remaining expenses where there is much room for reduction.

Issue number two – the credit cards. Since my wife and I have never worked at the same time, and I wasn’t working for 8 months before she started, we have managed to rack up a considerable amount CC debt just as a means to get by. Right now we are at $19,500 between four cards varying between a 10.5% and 15.8% interest rate (12.56% average). 

Since there is so much debt, I have started looking into CC debt consolidation programs that would knock down the total amount of interest and free up our utilized debt ratios. I looked at one from Wells Fargo that will consolidate them all in a loan at 9.25% interest over a 48 month period. It will increase out payments by about $150 a month but pay them off close to two years faster, and the total paid would be substantially less than if we keep making the minimum payments. Do you guys recommend programs like that? Or are there other options you would consider?

**EDIT 2: It seems Josh is working on answering the questions I've asked and compiled. We'll see what happens when answers are released.**


Hello, in the midst of this public uprising against GAW I'd like to present some facts for those of you who either:

a. Don't know who/what ""GAW"" is and why they're a scam,

b. Are brainwashed by Garza; those of you who genuinely believe in Paycoin and GAW Miners,

c. Don't quite have all of the information.

Note that I don't have every possible snippet of information out there, I'll just bring up some of the main points and complaints.

**Pre-GAW**

Ten months ago Garza was first introduced to the Bitcoin community [in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2r23f9/eli5_who_is_josh_garza/) and [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoinmining/comments/1yqx55/mining_rig_builders_do_not_sell_anything_or/). From these posts we learn quite a bit of information regarding Garza's past; he offered false business deals to eBay sellers to partner with him. In the first article, we see that after he offered this couple ""20% of his total profit"" from his mining company and the couple asked for a reasonable counter-offer of $5k/month to pay their bills since they were unemployed, Garza filed a false Significantly Not As Described case on eBay, causing the couple to quite a bit of money and seriously affected their finances. The couple did some research about Garza and found this:

&gt;After looking at their old facebook profile, we saw that they were originally DirectTV salesman preying on small rural towns around New England offering people high-speed, internet and other telecom services that these people weren't able to get for whatever reason before. GAW was able to coerce MBI (Massachusetts Broadband Institute) to donate $40,000 to them for helping to bring services to everyone in the communities. Garza promised to build towers and other bullshit in these towns to help provide services, but they never did. At some point even when community leaders (one was David Kulp) repeatedly tried to get in touch with them, they never heard back.

So, it seems Garza has a knack for deceptive practices 'eh? Since the posts are so long and there's a lot to discuss, I'll let you read them and formulate your opinion on Garza. (Thanks to /u/DidHeJust for the links to those threads).

**-Early Phases**

Originally, GAW showed NO proof of mining at all (not an address, block, pictures of mining hardware, pool usernames, nothing). Later on, during the Hashpoint 'mining' phase, he purchased 5 PH/s worth of mining equipment from Bitmaintech. For the short amount of time Paycoin was available for proof-of-work mining, there were tons of people renting mining rigs in order to get a cut of the ""$20 Paycoins."" Since the difficulty was fairly low, the prices per TH/s of these miners were very high, making it extremely easy to ROI on them. I'd be willing to bet that GAW rented out a lot of their hashpower for profit. They're currently selling the hardware they have left from this on oneminer.com. 

There was also a brief period of time where you were able to purchase hardware from GAW and have it point to a pool of your choosing; however, this didn't account for too large of a portion of the hashpower they claim to have sold.

**-Forums**

GAW Miners owns a forum created them them, Hashtalk. This forum is heavily censored; if you attempt to inquire about some of GAW's deceptive practices, broken promises, or Paycoin design you'll either be outright banned or shadow banned (your account will remain useable to you, but nobody will be able to see any of your posts). This led to [this uncensored discussion thread on Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=857670.0).

**- Broken Promises**

*Promise 1: **""Always Profitable""**

GAW Miners claims that their Hashlets would [always remain profitable](http://i.imgur.com/8tJTBuA.png) and the $0.08 fee per MH/s would [go down overtime](http://i.imgur.com/u57gSBE.png). You know what GAW did instead? They kept their fees the same even when people were receiving only 1 satoshi. That's hardly profitable at all, as it's the minimum amount that they can really pay. So, they decided to move to mining Hashpoints for Paycoin (another broken promise, explained later).

*Promise 2: **""Paycoin would launch with a $20 floor""**

This one is interesting. For the three months or so Hashpoint mining was available, Garza claimed that Paycoin would have a $20 floor (essentially that GAW would buy up any coin sold below $20 to keep the market place there or higher). Now, however, they've purged their censored forum of such claims so all that remains are screenshots as proof. Here's a few: https://i.imgur.com/YFXJiKB.png and https://i.imgur.com/HnotyMB.png
Paycoin was traded at about $20 for a very brief period of time, but since then it's been dropping steadily, trading at just above $6/ea currently. Garza has done nothing to rectify the situation since.

*Promise 3: **Large merchant support on launch**

From [this thread](https://hashtalk.org/topic/23711/paycoin-and-paybase-express) we see that Garza promises that:

&gt;That’s right, you will be able to shop with Paycoin on the Amazon, Target, Walmart, Macy*s and Best Buy’s online stores.

A journalism website, coinfire.cf, contacted Amazon and the other companies claimed to be partnered with GAW. These companies all denied being affiliated with GAW, Amazon even threatened legal action if this continued. Once the article was published, the coinfire website was mysteriously hacked and the day after GAW threatened legal action. Read more about it here:

https://coinfire.cf/2014/11/22/is-gaw-miners-lying-about-partnerships/ and http://www.scribd.com/doc/248372603/Coinfire-Cease-and-Desist

**-Censorship [Developing!!!]**

At the moment GAW is taking down videos they've posted where they've made a certain ""statement"" on their mining.

**-Paycoin**

Ah, Paycoin. An altcoin plagued by delays and broken promises. Originally set to launch at $20 per coin, falsely leading people into investing money into Hashpoint miners for profit. The things Josh is doing and has done to get people to use Paycoin are laughable, I'd consider it treason against the Bitcoin community. He purchased the domain btc.com for $1,000,000 only to have it redirect to Paybase. Fun stuff 'eh? He's also claimed that his coin would be better than Bitcoin, denouncing it in order to promote his own coin. From code snippets we've seen, Paycoin's ""Prime Nodes,"" part of the PoS system to generate new coins, has the ability to generate coins at a 350% interest rate. These wallets/stakers/controllers/nodes are only able to be controlled by GAW, of course. 
The code:

    int64 nSubsidy = 0;
    int64 nRewardCoinYear = 0;  // creation amount per coin-year
    
    if (primeNodeRate == 0)
        nRewardCoinYear = 5 * CENT;
    else if (primeNodeRate == 10)
        nRewardCoinYear = 10 * CENT;
    else if (primeNodeRate == 20)
        nRewardCoinYear = 20 * CENT;
    else if (primeNodeRate == 100)

**-Current and Recent Events**

It's also known that there was a massive security/data breech during the Paybase launch, which allowed users to see other's balances and personal information https://coinfire.cf/2014/12/31/massive-security-breach-at-paybase/ which is being blamed on a ""Cloudflare Caching Issue,"" however, that excuse makes very little sense.

Currently, people are having trouble withdrawing their Paycoins from Paybase, which GAW is blaming on Authy. Authy's services are functioning fine for all other services, which leads us to believe that it isn't Authy's fault.

When Hashtakers were sold, they would've only been really profitable at the $20 per Paycoin mark. With the current price people are losing money on their investment.

personalfinance,"Looking for some quick advice, college junior who just lost a few scholarships","My situation is this: I entered college with three scholarships that totalled to roughly $21k a semester, but have lost those for the time being. With some hard work it could be possible to regain those, but not for payment this upcoming semester (Spring 2015), only to cover my remaining two after that (Fall 2015 and Spring 2016).

The cost of my attendance is roughly $28k a semester. According to my parents, my savings account which they have been managing up until now, and where my payments come from, has about $23k left, and my college fund on the side has about $11k in it. My family's situation almost certainly doesn't qualify me for federal financial aid.

So essentially, if I decide to go back to school in a few days, i'll immediately have to dump all of the money in the savings account and cut into most of the college fund, and have 2 semesters left to pay with almost nothing left in the bank. Right now i'm looking at internships this summer with the intention of seeing if I can take a gap year from school and continue working with whatever company I might find a place with until, say, the fall of 2016. That way I might be able to earn enough to get me through the rest of my school and I even might have a pretty secure fallback once I graduate.

I'd be really thankful for any advice on whether or not this tentative plan of mine sounds like a good idea, and also perspective on how else to tackle this financial problem if the internship/job thing doesn't pan out.

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans?,"I found an offer through Citizen's Bank [here](http://www.citizensbank.com/promotions/lightenyourloans/) to refinance student loans at either a 2.31% variable or 4.74% fixed interest rate.

Currently, I have about $34k in student loans remaining broken down as such:
$4,328 STFFRD - 5.35% fixed
$4,133 UNSTFD - 6.55% fixed
$25,535 Discover Student Loan - 3.25% fixed

I'm paying a total of $394/month and should have these paid off in about 9 years or so.

Do you think it makes sense for me to refinance these loans for 10 years at 2.31% variable interest or should I just refinance the higher interest loans at the fixed 4.74% interest rate?

If I refinance all loans at the 2.31% variable rate, what are the chances that it could jump to a higher interest rate than I'm currently paying?  I'd hate to refinance the 25k discover loan and end up paying more than 3.25% as that's already fairly low.

My credit score according to creditkarma.com in November was 784 (excellent), but for some reason it's now 721 (good).  The only thing that's changed is my credit card balance.  I've been traveling a lot for work recently and racked up a bit of business expenses that I should have paid off this month.  Would it make sense to wait to until my score goes back up to refinance so I can get a better interest rate?

personalfinance,Housing- in the hole mortgage wise and wondering what options to pursue,"TL:DR  - 20-25k in the hole on a mortgage, wondering what is best/options that the group would suggest.

Bought a house in Fall 2008.  House was worth 150k and closed at 135k.  Due to having to pay for college, lack of down payment I leveraged a program called WHEDA.  This results in higher interest rates and the only option (one at 6.4% that is 97% of the value of the mortgage and the second at 8% for 3% remainder).

Area that I live in took a hit in the market (lowest value was 90k).  Right now I owe about 119k (only 1k of that is on the higher interest rate and will be paid off in march).  Zillow estimates the house is about 92,000 – 95,000 in value and that matches what other properties are selling for size/options/location.

GF and I are getting serious and looking at options.  Right now I do not have the savings that if it sold at 95k to make up the difference of 119k.  I do have a great 401k saved up and can take out a loan from that, which interest wise would be lower than what I am paying now.  Though my return on my 401k was 8% so I know I would be losing money this way also.  

I do have great credit, so a short/sale foreclosure seems like a really bad way to go.  I know that if value increases and market gets better, in a way that just means a future house would be higher value to (Girlfriend and I are looking for a home upon marriage).  I cannot refinance as the bank will only finance up to the value, thus still need to bring money to the table

I see the options as

1)	Continue to live there, have girlfriend move in when she is ready.  Take the money she leverages as rent at her place and put it towards mortgage.  After a few years, get it down to a wash (hope).

2)	Rental and try to break even after a few years.  Never been a landlord and there is risk of crappy tenants

3)	Sell at a loss/dip into 401k.  This ends up hitting investment of 401k which seems bad

4)	Continue as is, but potential it can go more in the red


I confirmed that fannie may/mac did not buy the mortgage, so I cannot go down the route HARP Loan.  

Are there any options that I could seek and have not investigated?  I know there is no magic bullet, but what would you suggest.

My end goal is to finish up my AA at community college and then go to an online college for Game Design (probably Full Sail University). Each quarter costs about $1500 dollars and I've been attending for 3 quarters. My family paid for my first three quarters, but I'm paying for my upcoming one and I maxed out my credit card doing so, with about $900 left to pay. My next payment is due January 15th. 

This is really stressing me out because I can't seem to save anything. My credit card has a $1750 balance on it and the limit is 1800. I just got an Amazon visa credit card and its limit is $1500. 

Part of me wants to just get a student loan for the rest of my community college, and get another one for the game design school. Is that even possible? I don't know how it works. I don't qualify for federal aid.

personalfinance,Confused as to where paying off student loans falls into the order for where your money should go.,"I'm done with school, employed, and have student loans I am currently repaying.  My employer does not offer a 401K.  From reading the FAQ (""I have $X, what do I do with it?""), I gathered that the general order of where money should go in this situation is: (1) emergency fund, (2) high interest debt (since no matching employer contributions apply to me), (3) additional savings for retirement.  I won't go past that because I am not anywhere near there yet.

My question is whether student loans that are at 6.55%, 7.6% and 3.5% are considered in the ""high interest debt"" category?  When I think of high interest rates, I think of credit cards and personal loans that are in the double digit interest rates.  

The reason for my question is I want to know what I'm supposed to be contributing to a retirement account while paying student loans off (which I will be doing for the next 8 years), or should I pay the student loans off completely prior to putting money into a retirement account?

personalfinance,Private Student Loans,"Hi PF, I've got some questions about private student loans:

I graduated from undergrad with a degree in music and no debt, thanks to a full scholarship, but have realized that I don't want to do music for a career and am pursuing psychology. The best way to get in to a solid doctoral program in psychology is doing a post-baccalaureate program, for which federal student loans are unavailable. 

One of the programs I'm looking at is at UC Berkeley, which has one of the top-rated psychology programs in the country. My parents live near the campus, so I could live at home and keep my living expenses to a minimum. The downside is that the tuition is $15,000 per semester for a three semesters, for a total of $45,000. Would taking out private loans for this be a terrible idea, considering that I have absolutely no debt right now? My goal is to obtain a Ph.D. in Psychology in the next 7-8 years. Graduate programs for psychology for the most part are tuition-free and include a stipend, so hopefully I wouldn't have to take out additional loans beyond the $45k.

What options are out there for a private student loan of this amount? Would I get totally screwed with interest?

personalfinance,Optimizing use of emergency fund with a line of credit?,"A recent post in PF led me to think of the following. I'd like to hear opinions and pointers to existing examples of this.

An innovative bank should set up an emergency credit line product. If you have a mortgage with the bank and never miss a payment, they will provide an ""emergency cash"" line of credit that is tied to the mortgage, i.e., is backed by the (increasing) home equity. Access to this line of credit should be simple and provide liquid funds within a few days (e.g., a special check that you could use for this purpose, or a credit card, or a bank transfer option, in any case it is important that this can be accessed without additional documentation or loan officer approval). 

The additional borrowed funds would simply be added to the mortgage balance, plus a processing fee. I think it is reasonable for the bank to charge a small fee each time you access this credit line. (Given the ~2% balance transfer offers on 0% credit cards that I get in the mail daily, I think anything &lt; a 2% processing fee would be competitive.)

The benefit for the consumer is that s/he can treat this line of credit as liquid funds that covers most of his/her need for an emergency fund. That would allow her/him to more effectively use money that would otherwise sit in a liquid, and low return, emergency account without worrying that s/he will sink in a short term liquidity squeezing emergency. If the credit limit for this add-on product increases over time, as you pay down the mortgage, then the consumer can decide over time how to optimize his/her liquid vs invested excess funds. For example, one could pay down other loans or even the mortgage balance.

The benefit for the bank is that they distinguish themselves from the many other competing mortgage offers up front. In particular, they make themselves preferable to the subset of prudent customers who think about emergency fund planning, which should generally reduce their overall risk profile. Such a system can also reduce the prepayment penalty from customers who refinance (with a different lender) when they are getting nervous about emergency funds. There may also be some benefit from ""good will"" where customers won't be as likely to refinance simply because they feel that they have a ""safe deal"". 

The bank takes on a risk if the emergency line of credit could push the loan amount over the house's value. Given recent history they'd be wise enough to avoid that (at least for the next year or two before they forget about this risk). That can be easily managed by tying the amount of the credit line to a standardized estimate of change in housing value since the mortgage was initiated. They also would have interest rate risk if the original mortgage rate is far below current market. As such, it is reasonable for them to float the rate of the newly borrowed funds differently from the original loan amount. 

As a follower of /r/churning, I'd particularly like a feature that ties the bank's 0% credit card offers to this. Admittedly, it takes some of the fun out of finding the best deal every few months, but some (other) people have better things to do with their time.  So, this would benefit the bank by automatically getting credit card revenue from particularly safe customers.

I'm interested to hear others' thoughts on this and pointers to such opportunities if they exist. If not, this community asking their banks for it may eventually generate it.",finance,1420247230

CryptoCurrency,Staking: the new mining,"Ever wanted to mine cryptocoins but found it daunting? Or maybe you figured out after purchasing expensive video cards and/or dedicated [ASICs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) that mining is a technological arms race that favours huge consortiums with deep pockets and close ties to hardware manufacturers -- in other words, a losing proposition.
 
So, what's a schmo to do? How can he/she join the cryptocoin revolution, amass coins, and hopefully profit from the growing phenomenon? Well, one could simply buy coins from one of the many exchanges and sit on them, hoping the price goes up. Or one could seek out specific coins that reward you just for holding them. The often misunderstood process is called staking or more formally [proof-of-stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) minting.

Basically, the strategy involves taking the money you would have spent on mining hardware and purchasing high-stake coins from a coin exchange, sending them to your personal wallet, and from there watching the balance grow. Yes, it's just that simple. 

In this scenario, proof-of-stake minting replaces the usual proof-of-work mining for block generation, otherwise known as securing the network and processing transactions. The more coins you hold in your wallet, the more chances you have of solving blocks and reaping stake rewards. There is no need for specialized hardware or software beyond your own personal computer and the specific coin wallet – a typical PC or laptop can easily run several staking wallets simultaneously – and the wallet does all the work of minting for you automatically. It's like having a high-interest bank account on your home computer.

Of course, all POS coins have different parameters and rewards for staking but mechanics are essentially the same. Coins sit in your wallet gathering weight, a product of the amount of coins times coin age. Once your coins have amassed sufficient weight, usually advertised in hours or days, you fire up your wallet, unlock it if it is encrypted, and it will attempt to generate and add a proof-of-stake block to the blockchain. With a little luck and enough weight, you'll quickly solve a block and receive a reward according to the coin's parameters. Immediately after, your coins are returned to and aggregated in your wallet for compounding gains, and the process starts anew. And the rewards can be staggering, upwards of 2000% per annum for some high-stake coins. 

Currently, there are a plethora of high-stake coins to choose from, and the current depression of all coin prices presents a unique opportunity to purchase significant quantities for which to stake with. Below is a list some of my high-stake picks with links to their wallet software, their advertised potential annual interest rates, and major exchanges where they can be purchased. This certainly is not a comprehensive list of POS coins and you would be wise to investigate further.

In closing, minting coins via the staking process is an easy, fun and a potentially profitable way ordinary people can effectively mine cryptocurrencies without all the hassles of actual mining. As with all cryptocurrencies, I urge you to investigate and learn as much as possible in order to protect your investment and reap maximum rewards from the staking process. Happy staking.

I've checked enough craigslist ads to know this is a reasonable price, and I've considered the cost of registration, gas, insurance, and repairs (Guessing I'll be spending around $250/month on it).

However, this car purchase is not going to happen immediately, and in the meantime I'd like to further pay down my loans. (I have already knocked out the 2 highest interest loans.)  Beyond the price of the car + purchasing incidentals, how much should I be keeping in reserve for an emergency fund?",finance,1420250936
investing,Invest carefully. There is turbulence ahead.,"Has anyone heard of Jim Rickards?  He’s the chief global strategist to the West Shore Funds, a portfolio manager, economist, and an author, but he’s also an advisor on capital markets to the US intelligence community.  According to Rickards, high inflation is on the horizon.  Rickards says in the intro to his latest book *The Death of Money* that the international monetary situation is similar now to what it was in the late 1970s, a few years after the gold standard was eliminated, and when inflation rose 50 percent during five years.  He’s particularly concerned with the similarly low Federal Reserve dollar index, and the actions of the IMF.  
  
On top of that, the Federal Reserve is printing money at an astronomical rate—according to Rickards, writing in 2014, they’ve increased the base money supply to over four times what it was in 2008.  When the money supply is increased, inflation usually follows.  
  
Plus, countries have been attempting to abandon the petrodollar.  According to [this Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/petrodollar-us-saudi-policy_b_6245914.html), the 1973 energy trade agreement effectively gave the dollar a “crude oil standard” instead of a gold standard—instead of gold, dollars could now be exchanged for oil.  Then the value of oil in US Treasuries fell sharply in the early 2000s.  With US sanctions and current foreign policy, including a worsening relationship with the oil producer Saudi Arabia (because of our talks with Iran--my point, not the Huffington Post's), and our sanctions against Russia because of Ukraine, many countries feel they no longer need to hold to the agreement.  
  
The dollar fell, and almost collapsed, when we lost the gold standard.  What will happen when we lose the oil standard?  
  
Inflation is coming.  With inflation comes decreased consumption and a scaling-back of companies’ production power.  And with that comes a devaluation of stock prices, and falling stocks.  
  
Which brings us to my final point:  Any financial instrument that derives value from rising stock prices and loss from falling prices will be a disaster for the party on the losing end.

Bitcoin,I'm going to Italy for two weeks in August. Do you think I will have opportunities to spend Bitcoin there?,"It's been a while since I've been anywhere out of the US so I'm really excited about my trip to Italy, especially after having just watched the movie The Trip to Italy, which is really good btw.

Anyways, it occurred to me today that I'm going to have my chance very soon to really make use of this truly global currency I'm obsessed with called bitcoin! I won't need to convert it to euros or anything else. I can just buy stuff, just like here. I think that's pretty damn cool.

So my question is does anyone know whether or not Italy has a thriving Bitcoin economy? I really don't know what to expect but I guess I am sort of hoping that it's kind of like here in the US where the smaller businesses, like restaurants and cafes, espresso bars, etc are getting hip to the future of money. That's kind of how it is here. Small local places are starting to use it here and there.

I'll have access to my federal reserve notes too of course, but in my dreams I do the whole damn trip in bitcoin.

I know that's not possible, but will I have any opportunities? Lots? Few?

We'll be traveling by train between most of the major cities.. Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples.. I think maybe Sicili too.

I should wear a bitcoin t-shirt and try to attract Italian bitcoiners :)

personalfinance,Should I pull out money from my Roth IRAs to pay off car loans?,"I know the quick answer is ""NO!"", but hear me out. I'd like to hear people's opinions on my situation rather than compare it to whatever I can find on google. I have two car loans totaling $24k right now. The interest rate is 2.1%, so pretty low. But it's costing me $945 per month (I'm paying more than the minimum on one of them). Since we bought a house last year there's been a lot more expenses that have made it a lot more difficult to stay in the black. My credit card debt has crept up to almost $7k. 

There's $30k in each both my wife's (which I fund) and my Roth IRA. I get two large payments each year, a reenlistment bonus from the military each November for two more years ($9k) and my tax return in February, which has been about $8k. I also have $10k in my TSP account, and my wife has $5k in hers. She's out of the military and is a stay-at-home mom, while I put 6% toward my TSP.

Right now I'm not able to save anything monthly and have only been funding the Roths with the large chunks I get, but I'm not going to be able to max them out. My thought was to just bite the bullet, pull $12k from each Roth and pay off the cars. Then with my tax return, pay off my credit card debt completely and stop using them almost entirely. I've been putting almost $2k/month toward the credit cards, but they're not really going down because I have recurring payments going to them and use them for gas and groceries. I want to stop that method but I can't switch to using my checking account for those expenses and simultaneously pay them down, so I need to pay them off in one fell swoop. 

If I got the cars paid off from the roths and the credit cards paid off from the tax retunr, I could then start putting $458/month into each roth, which was going toward the cars, and would max it out yearly and then use the the extra monthly income and future bonus and tax returns to put into an emergency fund and regular savings. I'm also going to be making $500 more per month come June and would like to put nearly all of that into savings as well.

I know that taking money out of the Roths is a last resort because I can't get those contributions back, but I need to get out from under these damn car payments so I have more flexibility with my monthly income and can start monthly contributions to savings again.

personalfinance,Curiosity - New Home Loan Scam or Good Mortgage Deal in California?,"What are the pros and cons of this new home loan that the LA Times just wrote about here: http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-equity-building-mortgage-20150103-story.html#page=1

What this thing's effect on communities, ect?

""Grace and Armando Ong were among millions of Americans who lost their homes during the housing crisis.

Today, the Azusa couple are in the vanguard of borrowers taking advantage of a new loan that helps lower-income borrowers build equity fast — and protects them against any future crash in values.

All with no down payment, no closing costs and no mortgage insurance. The Ongs' real estate agent, Jill Medley, called it ""the best loan in the history of real estate.""

The key feature of the so-called wealth-building home loan is a sharply reduced interest rate on a 15-year term. Instead of requiring a down payment, banks allow borrowers to use their money to pay interest upfront, often called ""buying down"" the rate.

The American dream is a reality.
- Grace Ong, a registered nurse at an area hospital
For their $400,000 house, the Ongs used what would have been a 4% down payment — $16,000 — to instead buy down their rate to 0.5%. In little more than three years of monthly payments, the couple will have more than 20% equity in the home, assuming the property value stays the same.

That more than doubles the equity they would build with the same amount down on a 30-year Federal Housing Administration loan at the going rate of 3.25%.

The Ongs pay only about $150 more each month than they would have paid under the longer-term loan, which would include a hefty mortgage insurance payment.

""The American dream is a reality,"" said Grace Ong, a registered nurse at an area hospital.

The loan was unveiled in September by Edward J. Pinto and UCLA researcher Stephen D. Oliner, resident fellows at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. A key liberal housing advocate, Bruce Marks of the Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, or NACA, joined with them to promote the loan.

The new loan aims primarily to help low- and moderate-income borrowers seeking to buy modestly priced homes. They cannot own any other property and are required to live in the one- to four-unit properties that they purchase.

In Southern California, the NACA program sets a maximum price of $400,000 for a single-family home, and $697,696 for a four-family property, so most purchases would be in lower-priced inland areas. Wealthier folks could get the loan, but they would have to buy and live in the low- or moderately priced neighborhoods.

The loan can benefit banks as well as home buyers.

In a NACA program, for example, Bank of America and Citibank chip in subsidies to fulfill their obligations under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act to provide affordable funding to modest- and low-income borrowers.

The banks have put a total of $13 billion into a program to offer discounted mortgage rates, now including 15-year as well as 30-year loans. Citibank offered the Ongs, who were NACA clients, the $400,000 wealth-builder loan at 2.5% and allowed them to buy down the rate.

Even without the rate subsidies, however, the inventors of the new mortgage believe that the wealth-building effect is still enormous and attractive to many borrowers and bankers.

""The 15-year loan is an equity-generating machine, which makes a down payment unnecessary,"" said Pinto, a former official at mortgage financing giant Fannie Mae and co-director of the institute's Center on Housing Risk.

Oliner said rapid equity growth is especially desirable in volatile real estate markets such as California's, where soaring home prices dropped like a rock in the early 1990s and again during the recession, leaving millions of borrowers underwater, or owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.

Marks called the 15-year loan a ""game changer"" — a way for his minority and low-income clients to be free of housing debt by the time their children go to college or they retire.

The loan is not for those who can't afford somewhat higher monthly payments, nor may it appeal to borrowers who want to lower their taxable income with interest deductions. But for those who don't benefit much from writing off the mortgage interest, and even for some who do, the equity-building loan could be a great deal.

Good candidates include many people in their 20s looking to buy a first home. They would do better, Pinto said, to buy a smaller house on a 15-year term than stretching for a bigger house and spreading the payments over 30 years.

""After five to seven years, their income should grow, and they'll have enough equity to trade up to a larger house to raise their young families,"" he said.

If they finance that second purchase with a new 15-year loan, they may pay it off in time to use the extra money for their children's college expenses...""

personalfinance,Typical College Student Seeking Some Specific Advice,"So r/personalfinance this is your typical college student seeking some advice, I constantly stress about money, it’s always the first thing on my mind, except when im spending it of course. Ranking my stresses I would have to say its number one. My mother has always been stretched for money and I saw how it affected her but now she is marrying someone new who has his life together and is really smart about his money. My dad used to be horrible with his money, he made plenty and would take on vacations all around the world and buy crazy things, he’s remarried and they have actually started being very cautious with their money now and I am pleased about this.


So that’s a little of my family history because I know spending habits can be started a young age and you can take after your parents. I used to be carefree with money and always had enough from working since I first turned 16. But I was not smart with it, whatever I had extra I would spend on video games, food, drinks, hanging out movies. Now I am an accounting major (yes I know I can manage other people money but I have a hard time with my own) who works for my states major news networks finance team.  I’m a junior at a top 30 school for accounting, I am 23 years old, live at home (I know that’s taboo in most place but my state its actually quite common till 25-ish or married) I pay all my own bills I just don’t pay rent or groceries, I know I am lucky and need to do better that’s why I came here after reading a lot of post on r/personalfinance.


So here is where I need some help I have been stressing like crazy over money trying to figure out why I am spending so much and why I don’t have any leftover when I should. I recently pulled all bank transactions for all of 2014 at all three of my banks. I managed to earn about $25,000 and I spent around $24,000. Bad I know right, for 7 months though I did have to pay rent and groceries and everything else, I lived away at another school for 2 semester. I do have a credit card although I just use it to fill up on gas and pay it off at the end of the month it has an $800 limit so I am not doing too much, it’s also for emergencies and car repairs. I have about $14,000 in unsubsidized student loans ( If I were to make payments monthly, which im not it would be $73.00) , a car payment where I owe $5,211 (payoff amount is $5,219) with monthly payments around $171 at a 3.9% APR interest rate and last but not least a $200 line of credit on my checking account that is paid off as well.


Now on to what I am brining in now, I currently just dropped my hours at work from 35 to 28 due to school (taking 16 credit hours) and I get paid biweekly, about $672 gross every check and $1,344 gross monthly. My must bills are as follows:
-	Car Payment: $171
-	Cellphone: $87
-	Insurance (renters and auto): $125
-	Gas: $120
-	Total: $503
I also have a gym membership for $11 month and Netflix for $9 and Spotify for $5 but those are luxuries not must haves. 


Everything else is spent on food, drinks, dates, hanging out, crazy amazon purchases, etc.
Attached is a sample of what I am thinking of how my budget should be, but I feel like I need some advice to really stick to it, they are easy to make but I can’t stick to it even with Mint, other apps, excel spread sheets. I’m pretty sure this will be downvoted into oblivion or not responded to at all, I take full responsibility for my careless spending and I know I need to change that’s why I have come here for help


Tldr; I effing suck with my money even though I am an accounting major and work in finance, I spend it carelessly and I need some help to really stick to my budget or figure out what to do before I stress myself to the point of having ulcers. The stressed is caused by me, not anyone else, it’s my careless spending.

investing,15K Down and the imminent market correction,"EDIT: Title should say DOW.  sorry.

70% of the US economy is consumer spending. Consumer spending is fueled by jobs. The unemployment rate may be down, but it doesn't take into account discouraged workers. It also doesn't take into account stagnant living wages and people who have only found part-time employment.

Couple that with inevitable inflation from all those years of QE and bailing out. Also couple it with inevitable rise in treasury bond interest rates (resulting in shift out of stocks and into treasuries), not only because of inflation, but also because we still have a debt problem that's been swept under the rug for the time being. Don't even get me started on the credit card and student loan bubbles.

With all of those matters considered, a 15K dow is still 1,000 points higher than the 14K high of October 2007 (right before the financial collapse).

I was so fed up with dealing with them for that prescription last year that I just started paying it out of pocket, which is why I thought it would be better to come out pre-tax with an FSA.  
  
I was under the impression that we could use FSA funds to cover the full amount (between $200-250 per month). Aetna decided last year that it would no longer cover the quantity that is prescribed (I've been taking it for 6-ish years and had to do the whole prior authorization thing each year, but this past year, they decided not to approve it because their ""criteria had changed""). The plan summary description has ""drugs and medicines that may be obtained by prescription, but are not covered under the medical plan"" listed under Eligible Expenses for reimbursement under the FSA. However, further in in plan summary, it mentions Benefit Determinations *Post-Service Claims*, which are filed after care has been received.

I finished my undergraduate in 2013 with about $27,000 in student loan debt including accrued interest. Since then I've paid off one of the five loans that constitute the above quoted amount, and have been making regular payments since then. Of the remaining four loans, three are Direct Federal Unsubsidised Loans with fixed 6.7% interest, and the last one is a Direct Federal Subsidised Loan with fixed 3.4% interest. All these loans are currently in deferment since I went back to school in September.

A few months ago I moved from the United States to the Netherlands to do my master's degree. As a citizen of the Netherlands, I receive a monthly ""study financing""; this consists of a base amount that is a grant, plus the option to max out to around 1000 euro, the difference of which is a loan with a 1% interest rate. Ie, I receive a base grant amount of 275 euro a month, and can choose to loan out additional funds up to 1000 euro. 

I've been toying with the idea of maxing out my Dutch study financing (essentially take out a loan), and use that money to pay off a large portion of my American student loans. While this would indeed pay off a large portion of my American student loans, it would not pay all of it off. This would leave me with a fair chunk of debt in two countries. I haven't done detailed math on this, but it would leave me with roughly 10,000 euros in a 1% loan in the Netherlands, and roughly $13,000 in American student loans (my parents are helping me pay). 

Here are my questions and concerns:

* 1) Is this even legal? Can I take out a loan in one country with a better interest rate and use it to pay off loans in another country?
* 2) Will the taxes on this be a nightmare? Will there be any taxes associated this this?
* 3) Am I setting myself up for financial disaster by having debt in two countries?
* 4) How much affect could this have on my credit score? My current US credit score is not fantastic (but not bad either) due to my student loans. I don't have a credit card.

I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science and Global Studies with a minor in Asian American studies. I had many career routes in mind that seem to never really take off. At first I wanted to be a Naval officer. My GF didn't like the idea so I sort of trashed it, but also because the recruiting atmosphere wasn't in my favor. Another career route was graduate school for area studies. I also wanted to be a scholar on SE Asian Politics, maybe a professor, etc. But I don't have the grades for it. I have many mentors that suggest I still apply and shoot for it.

I worked at a community non-profit from Sept. 2013-June 2014 as a project manager. I made about $1500 a month with no taxes (billed as an independent contractor). All of my professional experience has been in non-profit. I interned for the Asian American version of, I guess, the NAACP in DC. I worked at the Asian American Studies program at my university during school for a bit. I've had experiences in state legislative politics (ha.. I was just an intern) and even at the national level. Basically, I am skilled in areas that pretty much make no money.

In Spring of 2014 I enlisted in the Army National Guard. I intended to go to Officer Candidate School, but because of a juvenile arrest (for shoplifting $15 pair of jewelry...) I needed a waiver. Recruiters suggested I enlist and get a waiver to go to OCS. Well, they sort of left out the part where no one hasn't gotten a waiver in over a year, but I signed up as enlisted anyways. I didn't take the loan repayment bonus because I felt like the educational benefits were a lot better (they would pay for a graduate degree if I chose to go vs. $500 a month in student loans). I read that the student loan payments were a pain to actually get and was not worth the hassle. Monthly drill pay will get me around $200 that I hoped to throw into a TSP.

I have been in training since September. I will be done with training in a few weeks. Training has brought my spending down to nearly $0 because everything has been provided for. But come mid-Feb., I will be on the job hunt. I really am aiming for something that will get me $40k or more after taxes. I live in the Midwest so this is somewhat decent for an unmarried person with a college degree. My state has the most Fortune-500 companies than any other state in the Midwest, so I feel like it would be easy to find a job in corporate, but I don't see how my skills could apply to it.

Training is ending soon and I will be on the job hunt. I am scared I won't be able to find anything decent because I have really a mis-mash of experiences. My Army training is not applicable to the real world (I am a 13F, a dude that calls in artillery rounds), and my last job-job ended back in June 2014. 

I guess... I am asking for professional career and personal advice along side an analysis of my finances? I have a lot of debt for just a BA. Graduate school is something I dream of, and should be done especially since I know I can get it paid for via the National Guard, but it seems to make more sense to work at this point in my life. Marriage is on the horizon but maybe will be pushed back because of my student loans.

**Random Questions and Thoughts**

* I planned to pay $1500 a month in loan payments so I could possibly pay it off within 3 years. I want these gone quick. $24k, possibly more because interest, of these loans are private. In order for this to be done, I need a job that pays at least $40k after taxes, correct? I could get away with less.

* My GF suggested she and my parents loan me money to wipe away some of the loans so I don't suffer from the crushing interest rates. What would you make of this? Culturally, I would be embarrassed. My parents would too. 

* I have to assume and act as if I am jobless, because come next month, I will be. I could take as little as two weeks to six months to find a job. I should leave training with about $6500.

* I live free at my parents at the moment and will be moving in with my Aunt shortly. They don't ask me to help with bills because they know about my student loans. My family is here to help and I am thankful, but I feel incredibly bad. 

I guess that's it. This is kind of a mini-vent/writing out my thoughts. I had a talk with my girlfriend and family about my loans. It's a new year and I feel like I can really pay off my loans within 3-6 years if I can pinch every penny I have. Job searching will be my biggest obstacle to be honest. I could use a lot of advice on that.",finance,1420277425

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 360 - Special Edition: On Paycoin / Shibe Saturday #3,"Hey all, GoodShibe here!

Today is Shibe Saturday!  However I feel that today's regularly scheduled Shibe Saturday post needs to be set aside for a bit of a breakdown on the current Paycoin situation that's unfolding.  If you're here for Shibe Saturday, please pop to the end of this post for a list of all the fantastic merchants that we have available to us plus you can use our new **Dogecoin Prize List (beta)** to help you figure out what you can buy with the DOGE that you have! :D)

On Paycoin:

One of the good things about having experience is the ability to recognize patterns as they emerge.  The more experience you have, the quicker you tend to notice when things are going sideways before they go sideways.  Quiet signs that others might not yet notice will ping off of your peripheral. Red flags go up quicker.

Sometimes you end up being wrong, sure.  But the thing is that at the end of the day, you're paying attention.  You're watching.  You're ready.

As the Founder/Creator of the Dogecoin Defense Force (/r/DogecoinDefenseForce) I used to see all sorts of people buying GAW-brand miners and such.  Heck, GAW had quite a bit of good standing across multiple crypto-communities back in the day when they used to sell actual physical miners that would rest in your home.

Here's an article from back when GAW partnered with Zeus back in May-ish of last year.

[Zeus Miners Hosting Deal With GAWMiners Brings A New Manufacturer To The World Market](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/positive-implications-zeus-miners-partnership-gawminers/)

But here's the thing:  You're creating a machine that literally prints money.

And once you realize that, well...

First came the multiple waves of 'better' and 'better' miners.  

They'd sell one generation of miners then start selling the next gen within months, while selling the 'last' gen at deep discounts.  The newer machines with easier access to hashpower were pushing up the difficulty, making it harder for those who'd had the earlier generations to make even a fraction of their money back. 

People who'd just bought the 'last' gen, months earlier, found themselves in an arms race to keep up.

And the star started to fall.

Then came the idea of 'hosted miners'.  You could buy the physical miner, they would hold it for you, pay the electricity and you'd get the coins (for a small fee).  At first you could actually write to them and get them to send you the miner, if you wanted.  Then you couldn't.  You were also stuck mining wherever *they* wanted to mine.

If you wanted to mine some other altcoin or whatnot, tough luck.  You got the coins they gave you and then you had to swap them out for the coin you wanted.

Then came 'Hashlets'.  You bought a tiny slice of the pie.  Pay X number of dollars, get X number of 'Hashlets'... only there was no actual physical 'end' to the number of Hashlets that there could be.  So if you'd gone crazy and bought a share equal to 1% of the total number of available Hashlets, over time, as they added more power, etc to the network, your 'share' decreased.  Add in a 'maintenance fee' that just happened to end up soaking up whatever little money you were actually making, and, well, you come to the harsh realization that you've just paid them to build a mining network off of your back.

Sure, you still 'owned' the hashlets, but only in name.  You'd never, ever see any money from them.

Heck, [you can't even buy physical miners from them anymore](http://www.gawminers.com/collections/all-miners?page=1) (outside of one bitcoin [Rocketbox](http://www.gawminers.com/collections/all-miners/products/rock-miner-rocket-r3-box-450g-490g-gh-s-bitcoin-asic-miner) and [*used* bundles of incredibly outdated Gridseeds](http://www.gawminers.com/collections/all-miners/products/used-300-kh-s-5-chip-miner-by-gridseed-asic-dual-miner-scrypt-sha-256-same-day-shipping)).

Now it's just all-Hashlets, all the time.  And why wouldn't they?  Selling virtual, always shrinking, slices of a server farm is way, way more profitable for them than selling hardware.

But is it profitable for **you**?

Feel free to ask around, to talk to any number of the home-based miners who've been burned over the last year.

So, then comes talk of [Hashcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2l82kd/gaw_miners_to_ipo_hashcoin_guarantees_returns_of/)... then Paycoin and all these pie-in-the-sky claims.  I can go into detail but this /r/Bitcoin post sums it all up rather nicely:

[GAW Miners - Liars, Frauds - A brief recap of what we know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2r4gck/gaw_miners_liars_frauds_a_brief_recap_of_what_we/)

And all along the way, people who know have been trying to say 'stay away' and 'be careful' - because these aren't the actions of a company with your best interests at heart.

So, what's different about Paycoin, why do people seem so much more 'up at arms' than they were before?

Because people appear to be buying in, en masse... and they appear to be getting hurt already.  Claims of [users being banned just for asking pointed questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2r3eja/gaw_is_a_scam_hashtalk_is_corrupt/) and claims of lack of transparency and frustration from those who bought in based on promises that Josh had made.

What's worse, it seems like those who are actively defending Paycoin are acting like this thing is all being overblown.  And maybe it would be... if not for all of the shady stuff in the past that I'd just listed (let alone all the stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting).

At the end of the day, coins like Paycoin damage the entire credibility of the Crypto-sphere and help re-enforce negative views of all cryptocurrencies.

The people burned here, in this fire, will not be coming back - moreso, they will be out there telling everyone they know to stay away from all cryptos.

This is another reason why so many Crypto-communities are standing together.  They've seen this coming, they've warned people away -- and now that this thing seems to be catching fire and blowing up, they're trying to protect others from hopping into the flames with those already engulfed.

It's sad to say but the history here, all the things that came before Paycoin, has lead me to believe that what we're seeing is a company run amok, high on waves of endless greed - and, unfortunately, a whole lot of pissed off/frightened/angry investors who are caught in the middle.

Stay safe out there, my friends!

gaming,My outrageous Microsoft customer service experience; a cautionary tale. 43 Days and counting without a working console.,"I once had a working Xbox One DOL Edition; 42 days and 10 hours of work later, it seems like a distant memory.  

Long time Reddit lurker, first time poster.  
Made this account to share my story as a cautionary tale to those that are considering a Microsoft product through the Microsoft online store.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; tl;dr  

&gt; Mailed my console that didn't read discs to Microsoft 42 days ago, and I still do not have a functioning console.  
Spent 10 hours, wrote 4 emails, talked with 12 people, explained the situation 11 times, and was deliberately hung up on by Microsoft at least once.  
Microsoft's product packaging is not robust, and its customer service is terrible.

&amp;nbsp;

The following is a frustrating play-by-play of my nightmare.  Please enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

*Background:  
I pre-ordered an Xbox One from the Microsoft online store (paid in full) on 7/25/13.  
I received the console from Microsoft on launch day (11/22/13).*  

&amp;nbsp;

Xbox began having intermittent issue reading Xbox One game discs. (11/15/14)
Xbox could no longer read Xbox One game discs. (11/22/14)  

&amp;nbsp;

Went to website, performed troubleshooting instructions. (30 minutes)
Errors continued, filled out service request. (10 minutes)  
Paid for expedited shipping method through Microsoft. ($11.71)  
Drove to FedEx, obtained box, thoroughly wrapped with insulative material obtained by FedEx, packaged within FedEx provided box, and shipped.  Label was showing a shipment to Texas. (1 hour)  

&amp;nbsp;

19 days later, my console was returned. (12/11/14)  

&amp;nbsp;

Box was damaged, and I took pictures from various angles as I opened it. (30 minutes)  

&amp;nbsp;

[Pictures of damage] (http://imgur.com/a/QJddo)

&amp;nbsp;

Powered on console, and observed strange sounds emanating from console itself.  Did not output video.  Tried multiple HDMI cables, confirmed “To TV” port, (also tried “Cable In” although no reason for that to work) tried multiple TV’s and multiple TV-HDMI ports. (1 hour)  

&amp;nbsp;

Called Xbox HW support.  Described above situation, and was told by initial person to contact FedEx.  (Explanation 1) I asked to speak with a manager.  Again, I described situation (Explanation 2).  Was told by manager to contact FedEx to file a claim.  I explained that some protocol should be in place during such a situation, so that the customer does not have to continue to spend their time on a Microsoft issue, and without a product.  Manager concurred, and told me to contact FedEx. (45 minutes)  

&amp;nbsp;

Went to FedEx website, found claims department section.  Online claims filing is described as better, through reduction of errors, more insight into progress of claims, etc.  I attempted to start an online claim but received an error, once I entered the tracking information.  The error stated that my tracking number was international.  This is strange, because FedEx tracking information shows an origin in Laredo, TX.  I am forced to call FedEx to file a claim.  I call FedEx, explain situation (Explanation 3).  Associate enters tracking number, and tells me the package originated in Mexico.  
(At this point I suspect that the service is being outsourced to Mexico, I later notice that the box has a “Mexico” stamp on it, further lending credence to this theory.  Is Microsoft trying to hide this outsourcing?  I'm not sure, I'll let you decide)  
He starts the claim process for me, since I am unable to do so via the online method.  He instructs me to find the forms on the FedEx website, and to fill them out, provide documentation, and email to FedEx claims.  (45 minutes)  

&amp;nbsp;

I searched the website, and found the claims form.
I filled out the form, which required proof of purchase, and documentation of damage. (20 minutes)  

&amp;nbsp;

I created a document to clearly illustrate damage (including descriptions of multiple damage “events” that took place) and took additional pictures. I figured that if I provide more information to the claims case officer, the process would take less time to complete. (2 hours 15 minutes)  

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is a gif of the document](http://imgur.com/T7rsMRf)  

&amp;nbsp;


I submitted the form to FedEx. Per FedEx, the claims process typically takes 5-7 days. (12/11/14)
The following day, I sent an email to FedEx inquiring about the status, and asking if it had been assigned to a case worker. I did not receive a reply. (5 minutes, 12/11/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


After 6 days without word from FedEx, I sent another email inquiring into a status of my claim. (5 minutes, 12/17/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


I received a reply the following day “This claim is open under active investigation.”  This was the extent of the status update. At this time, it had been 5 business days, and 7 total days since the claim was filed. (12/18/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


After an additional 5 days, I sent an email to FedEx for a status update. I did not receive a reply. (5 minutes, 12/23/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


Since it had reached 15 days since I filed the claim, despite my thorough documentation that I provided, and without any follow-up questions from FedEx, I decided to call FedEx to try to understand the situation.  I reached a representative, and explained that I had submitted a claim, explained the time duration, documentation, etc., and asked for an update.  After waiting on hold, he told me that I needed to obtain a “shipper waiver” from Microsoft, and that my claim would be denied.  Since Microsoft had not mentioned the need for this item, and since this appeared to be the “resolution” to my claim, I asked to speak to the case worker.  Keep in mind, that this phone call was unsolicited, and it appeared that the resolution had already been reached, and I was not contacted or notified.  After being placed on hold, I was transferred to the case worker that was working on the claim.  I explained the entire situation to the case worker. (Explanation 4) He explained that Microsoft is the most restrictive shipper that they work with.  He explained that they have specific policies in place that prohibit the customer from filing a claim, that Microsoft themselves are the only ones that must file a claim.  He asked if I talked to Xbox HW customer service, I responded that I did, and he explained that I must talk to Microsoft Corporate, as they are the personnel that are aware of this policy. I asked for an email which stated the FedEx position, such that I could use this if necessary in discussions with Microsoft.  (To this person’s credit, they emailed me a statement in less than an hour.) (45 minutes, 12/26/14)  

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is a copy of this statement](http://imgur.com/IlGXYnM)

&amp;nbsp;


I searched the web, attempting to find a Microsoft corporate customer service phone number.  I found one, and called Microsoft Corporate.  I talked with an associate, and explained the situation. (Explanation 5) He stated that I needed to talk with “Xbox Customer Service”, despite what FedEx had told me.  He said that he would transfer me to “Xbox”, and would explain my situation to them, and then connect me to the line.  After waiting on hold, someone answers.  (The previous representative did not talk with them, or provide any briefing on the situation)  I once again explained the situation. (Explanation 6) Was told that there was nothing they could do, that I need to talk with Xbox HW.  Since I had been tossed around like a hot potato, I asked to speak with management.  After discussion with this associate, I explained that I wanted resolution to my problem.  I described that I wanted a console in my hands immediately, as it had been a total of 41 days, and an extraordinary amount of work while following all of Microsoft’s directions explicitly.  I suggested a refund of my original purchase as a possible solution, or a partial refund that would be equivalent to the current cost of a console from a retailer.  I explained that I would go to a retailer, and buy a new console immediately.  I explained that I would happily return all original HW to Microsoft that day.  He explained that since he was only “Xbox Live” customer support (It is clear at this point that Microsoft Corporate customer service transferred me to the wrong department) that there was nothing he could do, and offered to provide me with 3 months of free Xbox Live.  ($60/12 month = $5/month)  At this stage, I was losing my patience.  To his credit, this was the only time in this entire process that ANY Microsoft representative tried to do anything to provide some measure of compensation as a token of understanding of what I had been put through. I declined his offer, as I was not looking for hand-outs; I wanted a console I could play, and $15 of free Xbox Live did not put a console in my hands, and did not cover the cost of the time I spent on this one phone call alone.  He suggested that I contact the Microsoft store for processing a refund. (1 hour, 12/26/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


I called the Microsoft store.  I spoke with a representative, and had an extremely difficult time understanding her through her thick foreign accent.  I explained the situation. (Explanation 7)  She asked for my original purchase order number.  I gave it to her, and she then requested that I give her the order number from the damaged console.  She then asked for the original purchase order number again.  She then recited the situation, stating that I had placed my original order for the console,  (7/25/13) and received it damaged.  At this point, I explained the situation to her again (Explanation 8), and asked if she understood.  She placed me on hold, and then hung up on me. (25 minutes, 12/26/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


I called the Microsoft store back.  I spoke with a representative, and the first thing I asked was to speak with a manager.  She asked what issue I was having, and I briefly told her that I had just explained the situation and was hung up on, and that this issue could likely not be handled by non-management personnel.  She again declined, and stated in broken English (with heavy accent) that [paraphrased:] she would not let me talk to her manager until she knew what the problem was.  I explained the situation to her (Explanation 10), and she transferred me to her manager.  I explained the situation (Explanation 9).  I suggested my possible solutions.  She told me that since the purchase was made more than 1 year ago, she would not be able to provide a refund.  She stated that she would escalate this to the escalation department.  She stated that it would take 24-72 hours to get a response. (30 minutes, 12/26/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


5 days later (120 hours later), at 6pm on New Years Eve, I was contacted by the escalation department from a private phone number.  I was driving to a close friend’s house for a Housewarming party, and stated that I did not have my documentation handy.  His summary of the situation was that I received a damaged console, and that he would not provide a refund for what I thought was bad customer service.  (At this point, do you think anyone would consider this good customer service?)  I explained the entire situation, to confirm that he understood (Explanation 11) I explained that since the Microsoft store was my interface with Microsoft when purchasing the product, that it was the logical place to lobby a complaint and request a refund.  He explained that he was not willing to do that (as in “he”, personally) for a purchase made 2 years ago.  I told him that that purchase date was semantics, and that I did not actually receive the console until November, which was no more than a year and a few days (Since I did not have my documentation handy, I did not know the actual dates)  He continued to defend his position, and stated that it had been 1.5 years (which is disingenuous, since it had in fact been exactly 1 year since I received the console), and that he would consider providing a refund only for products in the 30-90 day range, and that it was not their policy to provide refunds for this situation. (After the fact, upon reviewing Microsoft’s policy [here](http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/warranties-and-repair/console-kinect-warranty) they do in fact have a provision in the policy for refunds due to defects within the warranty; again, another disingenuous statement by this representative)  I explained my dissatisfaction with how Microsoft was handling this situation.  I asked that if I purchased a new console from the Microsoft Store, would he process a refund on the new console, once I sent the damaged console back to Microsoft?  Answer was NO.  Since I was driving and could not take notes, I asked for a him to state this position in an email.  He said that we would, and confirmed my email address.  I then asked for him to include his supervisors contact information in the email.  He restated his position on this issue again, and said that he was the escalation department, the highest level.  I asked who would be accountable for this situation?  I asked again for him to include the contact info in his email.  He then stated have a nice day, and hung up on me. (15 minutes, 12/31/14)  

&amp;nbsp;


I did not receive an email from this representative.  

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a summary of the current situation:
I mailed my console to Microsoft 42 days ago, and I still do not have a functioning console.
I have spent 10 hours (610 minutes) of my personal time on this issue.
I have been forced to make 5 phone calls, talk with 12 separate people about this issue, and explain the situation 11 times.
I wrote 4 emails, filled out forms, and created a thorough document to explain damage.
I have been sent back and forth throughout Microsoft, and have not found anybody that is willing to take responsibility, and (almost) nobody recognizing the ridiculousness of the situation, and wanting to do anything to make it right.
I was hung-up on by Microsoft twice, and was not provided with agreed-to emails from Microsoft, and was denied a method to provide accountability for the situation.  

&amp;nbsp;

According to Microsoft:
“Microsoft is focused on ensuring a high level of satisfaction among our customers and partners. It is a core component of our business. Our vision is to provide experiences for our customers and partners, across all of their interactions with Microsoft, that they value and recognize, and enable them to realize their full potential.
Our goal is to be #1 in satisfaction across all audiences and in every market.”  

..and “Microsoft has a culture of Accountability.”  

&amp;nbsp;


Does it sound like Microsoft is fulfilling this statement?  
Is this what Microsoft considers high level customer service?  

&amp;nbsp;

Bonus LPT: Do not buy things from the Microsoft Store.  
Had I purchased this console from Amazon, and made them aware of this issue, I have a strong feeling that they would have resolved it themselves.

personalfinance,"I've had a large salary jump [30k+], am moving Into a house and just got engaged. What can I do with my new money for a better today and tomorrow? Details inside.","Hey /r/personalfinance! Long time lurker, first time poster here. This community always seems to give great advice so I figured I'd run my situation by you all to see what kind of suggestions could be made.

Here's the short version:

25 year old living in NY. I used to make 42k annually, but then I quit. I just got a new job starting at 72k [possibly 79k with night differential]. I have no debt whatsoever, school and car loans have been paid in full. I'm wondering what exactly I should be doing with my money so it doesn't disappear. My dad has suggested putting 10% into deferred compensation. He also suggested having additional money withheld for state and federal as a forced savings. What do you guys think? 

Here's the full back story if anyone is interested:

It starts with me working a mediocre retail job, slowly climbing into a management position making 42k. It was enough to support me and allow me to buy most of things I wanted while still saving some money on the side. I'm also in a long term relationship, one of those high school sweetheart kind of things. 

Then things fell apart:

1. My company started to go in a new direction and I didn't want to be a part of it. I had already wanted leave for some time but it's hard to walk away from a bridge you've been building for 8 years. 

2. My grandmother passed away, leaving all her home and debt to my father. My family wanted to keep the house and pay off her debt. We decided that the best way to do this was for my girlfriend and I to move in and pay them rent, which they would in turn put towards my grandmother's debt [home equity and credit cards amounting to ~70k]. Once the debt is paid we can live there rent free!

The emotional loss coupled with new and increased stress from work had me at an all time low. Not clinically depressed low, but low enough where I decided quitting my job was my best option. So I quit in early November without a real plan of action. 

FAST FORWARD to the present where things are looking up. I no longer have a girlfriend, she's now my fiancée =D [perhaps buying an engagement ring without any real income was a bad idea lol]. We're moving into the house in a week or two. Last but not least, I got a call back from an interview and I've secured an awesome new career. 

I've always spent my money in the moment but I'd like to look into the future and have my money amount to something. I'm very interested in financing a new car [I know /r/personalfinance hates new cars] towards the end of 2015 maybe early 2016 with a cost of around 30-35k, if actually possible. Also, projected wedding date of September 2016.

personalfinance,Mum has asked me help with remortgaging our house. Any help would be great!,"My mum &amp; dad looking to reduce the amortisation of their mortgage from 20 years to 10 years. 

Currently, this is the breakdown of the mortgages they own (all fixed rate).

A - £18,940, £105.80 per month, 3.19%

B - £70,488, £367.35 per month, 2.5%

C - £37,686, £255 per month, 5.18%

D - £19,623, £108.31 per month, 2.99%

E - £22,932, £119.52 per month, 2.5%

Total - £169,669.00, average rate 3.27%

In my opinion, their best bet would be to go with a tracker mortgage since interest rates aren't looking to increase very soon.

A - £180 per month 

B - £653 per month

C - £360 per month

personalfinance,Help with ~55k inheritance,"Hey all!

So my wife and I are expecting to receive an inheritance (likely within the next year) from a deceased grandparent. We’re expecting it to be in the 50-65k region. Anyway, I thought it would be helpful to begin thinking about what the best option would be if we do receive the inheritance so that we can be prepared, know each others expectations, and make wise decisions. And if it doesn’t happen, well that’s alright too. 

We are already determined to live within our means, pay off our student loans, and not incur any more debt. My first inclination is to use a large sum (perhaps all?) of the inheritance to pay off our student loans, which we have about 90k of in federal loans, and which is our only debt. Do you guys think that would be wise or unwise? 

We are not looking to purchase any property as we aren’t even sure where we will be located in the next years. We don’t know a whole lot about investing, but figured that unless we were guaranteed to make more than what our interest on our student loans is, it’d be wiser to pay off the loans first. The loans are a real burden, honestly, and with the amount we have it would be very nice to get them off of our backs. The only ‘need’ that we have is perhaps a second car, as it is a real challenge to get to our three jobs and grad school on a single car. That, and perhaps bulking up our emergency account. 

 
What do you guys think??

 
**tl;dr -- Potential ~55k windfall. 90k in student loans -- would it be wise to either put all, large sum, small sum, or none of windfall to student loans? And what to do with remaining?**

personalfinance,Best course of action for rental property,"My husband and I own a condo that we owe $119k on with 23 years left of payments at the current rate.  Currently it's only worth about $100k.  We are renting it out for $1200/month which is near the top of rentals in the area.  After mortgage, insurance, taxes and maintaines fees we profit $408 per year.  Any repairs come out of that money.  On average the association fees go up about $60 per year, which is faster than rents are increasing in the area.  At some point due to the increased expenses we will have a monthly loss.   We'd like to keep the condo with the goal that in the long term it will make us money.  
  
My question is once we have equity would it make sense to refinance?  Our credit is better than it was when we bought the place and national rates are lower so I'm guessing we could get a better rate.  I know there are some fees associated with refinancing so I'm not sure when it's a good idea and when it's not.

How much money have you sent across? I'll be sending less than 10,000 USD. Probably 4-6k.

Did you get hit with international bank fees or any bank fees in particular anyway? I'm especially worried about Wells.

personalfinance,Left it. Now what.,"Hey personal finance.

So some background about what's up. I was working for a great company for 3 years. Making over 80k/yr salary + bonus and great benefits. 

I had a line of credit and a credit card. I used the line to purchase a car and was paying the line off slowly but surely. (I should have been putting far more money on it per month)

Now 3rd year in, I was laid off. Simply I worked my way out of a job by creating a very streamlined process. Including using vendors overseas. Simply put, they didn't need to pay me anymore since it was all on the table how to do it, cheap.

It caught me off guard. I had about 10k in savings. This was right at Christmas. So I took a few weeks and went home to see family. I came back in the new year. Had my EI Filed, but because I got paid for my banked time there was a hold on my EI. So i ended up not getting any supplementary income for a month and a half. 

I tried to get work in my field for 3 weeks. And before I knew it, with car payments, rent etc I had almost blew through my savings within 3 months. And still haven't found work. The Art industry is a tough one sometimes.

Finally 6 months later I got some work in landscaping. Essentially giving up on my career I've been working hard to pursue for 4 years.

I got exceedingly angry that I've put all this time and effort into something just to get laid off, and not be able to get another job. 

I decided to leave the country and travel for some time. That sometime turned into a year with me working overseas to extend my travel.

Now I've come back and haven't paid my CC or Line of Credit in probably a year or so. I've really effed myself but don't know where to begin with a job. 

I guess I'll get any sort of job and start there in the mean time. I'm currently back with my parents for the time being. Not sure what to do.

I know that I've made dumb mistakes in the past and I don't need Captain Hindsight to inform me of those.  When you come from a dirt poor household, you don't really know what to do when you have expendable income for the first time. Just looking for thoughts on future endeavors.  It's only been in the past year that I've really gotten my act together financially.  Here's my plan.  Feel free to poke holes in it and help me to make it work.

First off, when I was 20, I bought a new car, overpaid and fell for all of the tricks for a total around $24k (counting the interest thus far). Made minimum payments for the first 2 year and now (at 23) still owe a little under $8k on it.  Now, I'm throwing twice the minimum each month at it just to get it paid off.  If I sell it now, I only expect to get $11k at most.

I'm active duty military in a career field that stays in one place and never really moves.  In my area, buying a home is cheaper than renting, so I'm getting a VA loan to buy a home in early March.  That's when my current lease ends.  With a VA loan, there's no down payment and I should be paying half of closing costs at the highest. Most of the lenders that I've spoken to have said I should expect to pay around $1500-$2000 in closing costs.  I know there's a higher interest rate to go along with it, but that's manageable.  

I've got $3.5k saved up and add about $650 to it each month. Like I said, I've only recently started to get my act together.  With me moving, I'm considering selling the car and getting an older truck. I don't plan on spending more than $5000 on it.  I can handle most automotive repairs on my own and I'm more familiar with working on those.  My idea here is to get rid the car loan debt and free up that payment money to go towards rebuilding my savings after closing on the house. 

On a side note, I will be getting about a $500 monthly pay increase around the time of the move. I dont want to factor that into my math, because of all the little cost that go along with owning a home.

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on finding the best of bad options: high income, high debt, high expenses","I'm a 35 year old established professional in an expensive city. I carry a lot of debt from a former life of wretched excess.  Taking on the debt seemed reasonable at the time, but my expenses have been growing and my debt maintenance is shrinking, and I wonder if PF has any creative ideas.

I make ~115K/yr, which after taxes, insurance, and pre-tax contributions to a 401K comes to a take-home of about $5000/month.  If I made no contributions whatsoever to my 401k, I would take home a max of about $5600/month.

I have $87K in the retirement account, with a 16K loan on it (i can borrow up to 1/2 of my account, all the 'interest' gets paid back to me by me, but I can only have one outstanding loan)  I took the loan a year ago as part of a strategy to consolidate some credit cards to lower interest rates.  It costs about $550 a month.

I have $40K in credit card debt on 3 cards, most at 7.9% interest (I've had the cards for a very long time, and thanks to Obama they can't change the interest rate on existing balances, though they can charge a higher rate for new borrowing and lower my limits to the existing balance).  My investments return more than the interest most of the time, but not by much.

The problems: My rent hiked from $2300/mo to $3000/mo in July. Outside the 401k, I have no savings to speak of.  I used to have a boarder who covered half the rent, but I had a baby, lost the boarder and acquired day care expenses, which in all lowered my available cash by $2k/mo.

So:  $3K rent plus $1K daycare plus ~400 in unavoidable bills (phone, gasoline, electricity, internet) plus ~350 in minimum payments  on the debt leaves me very little ($350/month or so) for everything else in life, like food, clothes, the occasional baby toy.  As I mentioned, I'm used to having about $2000/mo more than this.  Having a six figure salary come down to a nearly empty bank account at the end of every month is creating a huge mental block for me.

I could close the 401K and use the proceeds to pay off all my debt (and have about $6K left over), but I would pay over $30K in taxes and penalties.  On the other hand, those minimum payments would go away, as would the $500/month that's automatically going to the old loan, so I estimate my monthly discretionary funds would go up by 6 or $700.  That would be way more comfortable but I would have wiped out my emergency fund.  On the other hand, I'm one good rent increase from this being an emergency.

I could spend a couple of years aggressively paying off the existing 401k loan so I could borrow against it again and transfer all the credit debt to 401k debt.  Then if something really hits the fan, I can call the loan a 'distribution' and just owe tax/penalties on the remaining balance. But a couple of years of living very, very leanly makes me nervous.  Especially if the rent goes up.

I could try getting a line of credit of some sort to combine the 3 cards into one piece of debt, which would probably be at a higher interest rate but would make 3 payments one.  I may not pay the debt off any faster, but I'd be on the hook for less payment per month.  The debt has come down from over 90K a couple of years ago, but with my new situation I'm not making much headway anymore.

I could change jobs, and try for a higher income.  I actually did just ask for a raise, and got about 6%, but it only helps so much when rent goes up by 20%.  Changing jobs might require a distribution of the outstanding 401K loan, and the resulting tax issues, but it's hard to say.

personalfinance,"How can I know the ""global"" interest rate that is used to compare with the interest rates of bonds?","I'm newbie in investment, and I'm recently planning to get into investing bonds.

I understand that the interest rate the bonds are comparing to are relative to the purchased bond's interest percentage. So if the ""global"" interest rate is now at 5% and the one bond I have in hand is at 3%, this bond that I have probably doesn't worth as much at this time.

But...

I received a decent year end bonus from work and with it, finished my 6 month emergency fund (sitting in a CU saving account), and I am looking to figure out what to do with the rest of it.

I was originally planning to use it to open an IRA account for my wife (already have an IRA for myself), but in the FAQ is states that all high interest loans should be payed off first. 

I have 2 loans, house and a car loan. My house is about the 4% interest rate sitting at 4.625 and I usually put a few hundred in additional principle on that loan, but have recently read here that the additional principle should be invested in hopes to make more than the 4.625% rate on my house loan.

Anyways, I am getting close to hitting the 20% payed off mark which should get rid of the PMI (additional $35 a month) and was curious if I should go with the FAQ and keep paying off the house loan with additional principle payments, or is it better to make normal payments and invest the rest to try and get more than the loan interest rate?",finance,1420396193
personalfinance,"I'm an idiot, New Year's Surprise: 'IL tax levy' for $1,600...best way to resolve this ASAP?","Hi,

I was going to post this on R/taxes but there are many more users here. I'll keep this short and sweet with a timeline and brief explanation below it:

8/2012 - I move from NYC (finishing school) to start my entry level job at a consulting firm in Chicago. I live in Chicago for almost a year (8/16-7/31). I had an apartment w. lease from 9/7-7/31. 

8/2013 - I move to NYC for work and have lived here since. In March, I did my 2014 taxes for IL and NY since I lived in both states. 

Until this past summer, I've been pretty immature about my finances and investing. I wisened my act up in 2014 when doing my taxes. Thanks to this subreddit and other resources, I learned proper budgeting, investing, and established a sense of financial confidence that I've maintained to date.

I logged into my bank account recently to see how my spending is tracking to my goals and had a double take when I saw the following under Pending Transactions, ""IL tax levy, due for payment on 01/20/15 on 12/31/2014 - $1,634.75"".

I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of this levy, but I'm guessing I screwed up while doing my taxes? I recall I used some free software and had some what of a tough time trying to figure it out since I was doing the taxes for Chicago and NYC. I thought I followed the instructions correctly and did my federal taxes followed by IL and then NY. Shoot, I have a email from early April stating that 'Status: Illinois Electronic Return Accepted'. I guess I was naive and thought this was all that needed to be done..

I searched the net and found this website on Illinois government website on how levies work: http://www.revenue.state.il.us/Individuals/collection.htm They state that they will contact me, but I didn't receive anything from them otherwise I would of addressed this ASAP! I don't want to mull over that; my goal is to resolve this ASAP. I do not fancy the idea of owing money to the government/IRS. I am wondering what the best way to resolve this is?

I see that I can contact IL Revenue Dept. here: http://tax.illinois.gov/AboutIdor/ContactUs.htm Would this be the best way to pay off the levy? Since it looks like they are going to debit my bank account, does it make sense to try to pay it off via the phone? I still want to talk to them to figure out how this levy came about..

While I'm the first to admit I'm a huge idiot to cause this situation to occur, I'm grateful that I have an emergency fund saved up for this exact situation. I would appreciate any advice on how to best proceed with this situation and how to avoid in the future.",finance,1420398790

I'm a little unsure of the path I should be taking to erase the unsubsidized debt.  With my job now paying for my tuition going forward(1 year waiting period after being hired) as I continue my education to get a Bachelor's Degree(already have an Associate's) I feel that I really need to step up on paying this off.  I know now that I probably should have been more aggressive with paying this off when I first got hired.

My monthly bills/expenses total up to $1.5k and I'm currently putting only $250 towards my unsubsidized loans each month(this is most definitely not enough) leaving me with ~$750 in savings each month if I don't work any overtime.  My current balance in my savings account is $40k.


Should I just pay my whole loan off?  Should I just pay off the higher interest rate balance and put a higher monthly autopay?  Should I just put a higher monthly autopay on the whole lump sum?

personalfinance,"Can no longer contribute to roth, invest in 401k without matching or invest in a traditional IRA?","Long time lurker, first time poster. Would love some advice on me and my spouse’s retirement planning. We are in our late 20s and our long term goals are (1) having a house or condo without a mortgage, and (2) having the option to retire early. Therefore most of our savings are going towards saving for a house and saving for retirement. 

Facts / Background:  
Combined gross income: $200,000  
Debt: $0  
Emergency fund: $20,000*  
Various Savings Accounts (house fund, education fund, car replacement fund, vacation fund, etc): $20,000  
Emergency Fund + Savings Accounts: $40,000  

*Currently contributing $3,000 a month to our emergency fund until this reaches $40,000. At $20,000, we have enough to survive six months without a change in lifestyle but we would like to have a 12 month emergency fund.


Retirement Questions:  
I have a Roth IRA with index funds through Vanguard with about $10,000 in it, and I will be contributing the maximum sometime in the next few weeks for the 2014 tax year. Since we received raises midway through 2014, our gross income for 2014 is under the Roth IRA limits. Therefore, I am able to contribute for the 2014 tax year, but this will likely be the last time I am able to contribute for at least a few years.  

My spouse is a public employee, and is enrolled in the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). My spouse contributes 4.92% of gross salary, and employer contributes an additional 9.2% of gross salary.  

Since I can no longer contribute to my Roth IRA, we are wondering what to do. My employer offers a traditional 401k, but the fees seem relatively high and there is no employer match. My spouse’s employer offers a 403(b) (traditional and Roth) that we can contribute to, and it seems to have a good fund selection and low fees. There would be no matching since my spouse is already on the PERS retirement program.  

My spouse has a Thrift Savings Plan (traditional) with about 20k in it from previous employer (federal government). It has very low fees, but we are no longer eligible to contribute to it. Should we just leave it there, or consider rolling it into a 403(b) through my spouse’s current employer? I'm not sure if there are any advantages to just leaving it there or whether it's better to roll it over.  



With all that said, here are my specific questions:  
1) Can’t contribute to existing Roth IRA. Spouse has PERS pension, should we also start contributing an optional 403(b)?  

2) Spouse has an existing low fee Thrift Savings Plan from the federal government. Leave it there or roll it over?  

3) Would it be worth speaking with someone about all of this? If I wanted to talk to someone about all of this, what type of person should I speak to? Fee-only CFP? Financial Advisor?",finance,1420416494

personalfinance,Quick financial checkup for a longtime lurker,"So in the past I haven't been as smart with my money, but I think I've generally done ""ok"" for myself as far as financial responsibility. I have read the FAQ a few times, but I'm not quite sure what exactly my next steps should be. I have been a huge lurker on this site and figured it wouldn't hurt to get some of the expertise opinions out there. 

I was in the military most of my early 20's. I was married at a far to young age and had a child on the way. Thinking it was a smart idea we bought a house in early 2008 at $150,000. Things have not worked out since then and I have been deployed, divorced and out of the military. In the divorce decree the house was to be sold but since the market has taken a downturn it is only estimated to worth around $120,000. I'm forced to rent it out for now barely covering the mortgage and just having to upkeep the maintenance. 

I'm 26 now and have moved closer to family on the west coast and work for the federal government. You would think I had learned my lesson, but I couldn't resist the housing market, and purchased my primary home for around $100,000 in 2011. So far that seems to have worked out much better for me and is currently valued at around $160,000 and slowly rising. 

I bought a new truck back in 2009 and it is paid off now, other than the huge mortgages, no other debt except a couple hundred on a credit card I pay off each month. 

I have my son joint custody so I do not have any child support obligations. 

Anyways, I'm curious what some internet strangers have to say about this breakdown:  

**Income**  
Paycheck Bi-Weekly: $1573.85 after tax and deductions  
=3147.7 Monthly  
VA Disability: $130.94 Monthly  
=3278.64  
GI Bill Payment/Book Stipend: Roughly $700.00 every 4-5 weeks  
=3978.64 per month of income   
Rental Income: $950 - 10% Mgmt fee ($855.00)  
=4833.64 total  

**Debt**  
Rental Property Mortgage: $138,000 @ 3.375% = $852.38  
Primary Home: $95,000 @ 4.37%  = $642.37    
=1494.75  
Groceries: ~$250    
Insurance: $110  
Phone: $95  
Internet: $71  
Dining/Bars/Restaurants: ~250  
Utilities/Power/Water/Security Monitoring: $250  
Fuel: $150  
Shopping/Entertainment: $200  
Childcare: 120.00
HOA: 34.50
=3125.25

4833.64 - 3125.25 Which leaves about a rough estimate of $1708.39 worth of cash flow that I'm basically saving.

personalfinance,Thoughts on Student Loans..,"Hello PF,

I've been lurking on this thread for a little while and wanted to point something out that I've noticed.

It seems that there are a lot of questions/recommendations on student loans, particularly if it would be in ones best interest to pay off their loans early or put the funds into investment vehicles.

An analysis that is often recommended to help answer this question is pretty straight-forward..

Is the interest rate on your student loans higher than an expected return in an investment vehicle?

If so, it is generally recommended that you pay off you loans first before investing in your IRA, Maxing your 401k, ect.

As someone who currently has student loans, sometimes I feel a little different than the community. The interest I pay on my student loans is completely deductable this year. I believe you can deduct up to $2,500 dollars every year for student loan interest.

So assuming you do not have interest payments which exceed $2,500 every month and you can afford your current student loan payments, why the rush in paying them off so quickly, apart from piece of mind?

Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to deduct the interest paid towards student loans from your taxable income completely.

Why wouldn't one decide to put funds into their investments in place of paying off the student loans quicker?

As of today, I have roughly $130k in the bank. I purchased my home for $115k and am getting a loan for roughly $10k to make renovations, seeing as it's a foreclosure and has been gutted of all the copper in the home.

My initial plan with this home was to throw a large portion of my personal savings into the principal on my loan. However, a lot of my coworkers have been advising me that this may be foolish.

My APR on my home loan is 3.875% and the principal (including renovations) is roughly $125k. I had planned anyways to put $40k down bringing my loan total to $85k.

My question is as follows: would I be better off investing more in my principal to decrease my total loan amount? Or would it be wiser to take this money and instead invest it in the market? The logic being that I can earn a higher interest rate in the market than what my loan is growing at.

personalfinance,Filing Taxes and Roth IRAs,"Hello all. I had a question regarding my situation. 

Background: I'm a 20 year old student, entering my 2nd semester of junior year, plan to take a gap year then apply to med school. My parents make little so I'm on a full ride. I live off campus since my financial covers it and it is cheaper than on campus, have about 10k in loans out now, will probably have about 13k when I graduate. 

I have two jobs and I plan to aggressively save after a year of varying medical emergencies on my part and my mother's. I may get a third if things start to look sour again. In addition to the two jobs I also tutor online at a rate of 0.33/min. I do it when I end up having the time.

After graduation I hope to find a program that will allow me to spend time in Central America so I can perfect my spanish for 6-8 months. In the remaining time I have in my gap year I will likely return to bartending for the short term if all goes as planned.

I carry some credit card debt and my credit score is in the high 600s (I have a Discover It card that lets me know this range). I aim to have one of my cards paid off by the end of the semester and the other paid off soon after that. I will be working full time over the summer with one job, with a class and studying for the MCAT. 

Part of why I still am in some debt despite my own spending habits, savings, and multiple jobs is that my father is still struggling but things are pacing slowly. My older brother works full time and helps out I home. I take care of my younger brother's (9) needs and my baby cousin (3) since her and my aunt live me with. My aunt cannot work, my mother cannot find work. 

I do the best I can but I want to do better.

Question: I don't want to my entire life paycheck to paycheck and I've spent some weeks researching finances and have decided to start by opening a Roth IRA with Scottrade. I don't file taxes now, my parents claim me as a dependent. By opening a Roth IRA, would I for any reason need to file taxes? I know that that account wouldn't impact my federal aid, with need assessment with medical schools themselves varying. I don't know much about taxes and want to be as smart as possible. I do get a W-2 from my jobs, they are both on campus one is work-study and it pays less than my non-work study. I make too little to have to report but I pay taxes on each paycheck.

personalfinance,401k loan - what's the catch?,"Hello there PF, love the subreddit. 

31/M/CA

I've got a question for you guys that I haven't found answered through a search of the sub. 

I'm strongly considering a 401k loan,  and cannot see a negative to it yet. I would love some input. 

I'm getting married later this year, and the short of it is I need some extra cash. We're spending $10-11k on the festivities and have saved about $4k. My parents kicked in $3k - so I would like to have another $4k or so to cover the costs. 

Salary $85-90k. 

Checking $3k

Savings $10k (This is the emergency fund)

401k $65k (emp match 5% I've been contributing 10%)

Only personal debt is $3k on a Honda that is worth at least $11k (lowball)

I was fortunate and bought a house at the bottom of the market the years ago. Mortgage is manageable at $1400 with taxes/insurance. All of the accounts have trended positively but slowly over the last couple of years. 

I would love to leave the EF untouched. If I'm borrowing out of my own 401k I would also like to have another couple thousand to complete a half-finished bathroom remodel. My fiancée has $6k credit card debt she has not been able to get ahead of,  the interest rates are sky high and she makes ~$60k (last year, before then it was $40k). She pays all of the utilities and food, HOA, and other assorted bills to balance out her share. I would also like to take $6k to pay those off and get her ""in the black"". She's going to pay it back to me over a long repayment plan but that's not important. What is important to us is ridding ourselves of these outrageous interest payments. 

So I was thinking I would borrow $12k from my 401k. I could scrape through all this without - but it terrifies me to compromise my safety net. 

I would repay this loan to myself over 2-5 years directly from my paycheck.  Am I missing something? It seems too good to be true, and a far better option than any other form of lending. Thanks for any input!",finance,1420437094

* $7k in 401k (contributing at 5% - minimum to get employer match)
* Owe $8k on 2010 Honda Civic w/ 90k miles
* Owe $20k in student loans
* No interest-bearing credit card debt (I pay off full balance each month)

The question I have is: where to go from here? I just hit 7k between my bank accounts, which I estimate to be about 3 months of spending at my current standard of living. The options I'm considering are:

* Continue what I'm doing and keep adding to my savings account
* Increase my 401k contribution rate (maybe to 10%)
* Maintain 401k contribution at 5%, but also start a Roth IRA (I was thinking about the Vanguard Roth with only $1000 minimum)
* Accelerate student loan payments (avg interest rate of 6%)

My car loan interest rate is only 2.1%, so I figure I might as well maintain normal payments on that. The real questions are - is my emergency fund big enough? And if so, is it better to increase retirement contributions or to accelerate student loans?

A bit of backstory, I have a poor history with credit. I'm currently repaying 3 lines of credit that I let get to the stage of threat of debt collection, totally around £3,500. I also have 2 student bank accounts with overdrafts, totalling £2000.

On a curious whim, I recently applied for a store account at an online retailer and was given a credit limit of £750. Full disclosure, I've ordered £700 worth of items already, and I've only had this account for about 2 weeks. I did so under the following terms:

£480.05, Buy Now Pay Later (6 month grace period)

£55, no grace period

£97.45, Buy Now Pay Later (3 month grace period)

£65, no grace period

£32, no grace period


On another curiosity whim, I applied for a credit card through the same online retailer, provided by Capital One. I was accepted and have been given a credit limit of £1000.

My question I suppose is this:

Should I pay the full balance on the store account using the credit card, thus not paying any interest on any of the items, and just pay back the balance of the credit card?

The payback rates are as such:

On the store account, minimum repayment is £5 or 7% of the total balance. APR 44.9%

On the credit card, I'm not 100% sure on the interest rate (I need to get home and check, and I can't seem to find where to view it online for my account) but I imagine it'd be a similar rate.

personalfinance,How to best leverage the built up equity in my house?,"A happy new year to all my fiscal responsible peeps!

I'm a long time observer of this thread &amp; really enjoy reading the issues discussed here. Figure I'd finally make a post

My situation is that I feel I'm not really taking advantage of the equity that my wife &amp; I have built up in our home... I'm wondering what the best approach would be to leverage it. We purchased a (dilapidated) home for 2.5 years ago &amp; have since done a shit ton of work bringing it to modern standards. It's present market value is roughly $700k &amp; we owe a balance of $250k on the mortgage. The house also contains a rental unit, which we are just putting the final touches on &amp; should have that rented out Feb 1st, bringing us $1,600 - $1,700/month. 

Our short term goal is to have enough money saved in 5 years for a down payment ($250k) on a 2nd home &amp; keep this house as a rental property. We live in Toronto &amp; the housing market is intense. IMO, I think we're in a bit of a bubble &amp; house prices are a bit overvalued right now. However, we've been hearing this for the last 5-8 years though... My strategy for limiting risk has been: A) location; close proximity to transit is a must, B) older/unkept property; I'm willing to put in the work to improve the house and C) it has to be a (detached) house; we have a glut of condos in this city &amp; single-family homes are priced at a premium. This is my personal belief, so I definitely could be wrong here.

Based on our incomes, we could get a HELOC of about $250k at 3.5% against our property. If we were to tap this equity, what's the best approach to investing this money without exposing us to alot of risk?

Edit1 - added interest rate to HELOC

Edit2 - should have probably given a quick background of where we are at in our lives. We are both 29 &amp; happily married. Our combined HHI is roughly $125k year &amp; we plan on having children in roughly 2 years. Beyond the mortgage, we have no debt.",finance,1420474896

My SO has about 7k in debt and was planning and killing off her debt first, keeping mine in good standing and then attacking mine.

Anyways that's the back story. After punching in my bills vs my take home with no entertainment allowance I should have over 1700 a month left, which I don't. At all. So that's why I'm budgeting.

personalfinance,(SWE)-Mortgage w unequal ownership. How to split interest costs with changing ownership %?,"The facts: I bought an apartment in my name and took out a mortgage for which I'll pay a fairly large deposit. The mortgage is interest-only for the next 5 years with the option for downpayments each 3 months.  
I can carry the mortgage alone but my girlfriend would like to invest money into our property/mortgage so we'd like to devise a system where she can get some ownership bit by bit.  

&amp;nbsp;

Currently a 50-50 ownership ratio is undoable for the foreseeable future considering my large deposit. Unequal ownership in itself isn't a problem per se, as long as our ownership is divided fairly (by which I mean it's not neccesarily evenly split, just split based on money put into the mortgage) and our interest costs are dependent on our current ownership ratio.  
The goal is for the both of us to put in regular (3 monthly) downpayments to pay off the loan although I don't require her to do so, it's just a possibility for her to do something with her savings (and get some ownership obviously).  

&amp;nbsp;

I usually don't see a lot of talk regarding the interest costs but I started thinking about it because in this system it would be possible for her to wait, say 20 years, and then pay in 50% as a downpayment and own 50% of the property, bypassing all interest costs for 20 years!!  
So it seemed only logical that in that case she would need to pay 50% of all of the interest costs in those last 20 years...  
But waiting till we have paid off the mortgage to settle the differences in interest costs also seems silly so I figured every time downpayments are made, and thus our ownership ratio's change.  We'd settle the differences, but it's a hell of a braintease for me! Although that seemed entirely fair unless I'm missing something? 
 
&amp;nbsp;

Going with this system I devised the following rules for clarity:

&amp;nbsp;

* Ownership based on relative money put in by the both of us.  
	If I have paid in 900 000 SEK and my girlfriend put in 100 000 SEK. Then I own 90% and my girlfriend 10% of the property. Our ownership is calculated each time we make downpayments.
* Interest paid montly, split between us according to ownership.  
	In the above example if the total interest is 2000 SEK monthly then I pay 1800 SEK (90%) and my girlfriend 200 SEK (10%).
* Amortization and change in ownership. Every x months/years (depending on how long the loan rate is locked down for) we pay in whichever sum we want and calculate our ownership based from that. Future interest costs are based off this.  
	This does mean that interest costs before this new rate were not split fairly and there are costs due that should be paid by the person with least ownership to the one with the biggest ownership.

**EXAMPLE:**
*(The interest costs and downpayments are just fictional to explain the formulas)*

&amp;nbsp;

First 3 months:  
My total downpayment is 900 000 SEK, girlfriend 100 000 SEK. I own 90%, she owns 10%. Interest is 2000 SEK of which I pay 1800 SEK (90%) and my girlfriend 200 SEK (10%).  
(This would be valid for the next 3 months since it's an interest only mortgage)

&amp;nbsp;

After this period:  
We both pay in some money into our downpayments, I pay in 100 000 SEK, she 150 000 SEK. Now our numbers look like this:  
I paid in 1 000 000 SEK total now, my girlfriend 250 000 SEK. I own 80%, she owns 20%. Interest is now 1600 SEK monthly of which I pay 1280 SEK (80%) and my girlfriend 320 SEK (20%).

&amp;nbsp;

Since my girlfriend only paid 10% of the interest costs in the last 3 months but now has an ownership of 20% she should pay me back the difference to have the right to that ownership.
The difference is 2000 SEK - 1600 SEK = 400 SEK for 3 months = 1200 SEK.
The difference in ownership for my girlfriend is 200%, from 10% to 20%, she now owes double of what she used to and thus has only been paying half, 50% of the costs.  
She therefore owes me 1200/2 = 600 SEK which she pays at this point in time.  
Rince/repeat after the next 3 months.  

&amp;nbsp;

**This seemed like the fairest, idealistic, solution... But I think it might be unworkable since it's gonna be complicated and we'll need to log too much stuff for the next years.
It'll also get super complicated when our amortization plan kicks in after 5 years and our ownership/interest rates would change all the time...
Realistically speaking our downpayments also wouldn't be that large so that the difference would be such a meaningful sum... So therefore I'm opting to just settle the differences once a year instead...
That should keep my sanity although I'll miss out a little bit by paying too much interest but only in the most extreme case I said in the first paragraph (waiting 20 years to pay in a sum) would it make much difference.**

personalfinance,Completed first year of my own company and I’m ready for tax season... I think. Need a little guidance (Louisville KY),"Hi PF
In January of 2014 I started my own mechanical design company. I registered it as an LLC with sole proprietorship. I reside and work in Louisville KY. I got a lot of help from friends that have their own startups and that put me on a good financial foundation. I estimated a yearly income and paid quarterly taxes to the Federal and State levels.

I kept a workbook of all my invoices, work expenses, and work equipment. I have scanned in all receipts that match all of my expenses. I lived at home from January to August and paid them ‘rent’, which amounted to $300 a month. I slept in one bedroom and converted another into an office. I started renting a 2 bedroom house in Sept and made one of the bedrooms a dedicated office for my company. I use Kynect for health insurance. I know some of these things are deductible, but I don’t know what exactly I can use. I’ve documented everything and kept it organized to make this time of the year went as easy as possible.

So I have many questions like. Can I deduct some or all of the $300 I paid as rent to my parents? How much of my house rental and utilities can I deduct? Can I deduct my internet service (no tv, no phone) since I use it primarily for work? Can I deduct things like cameras that I have bought for work, but might have used a couple times to take pictures of the great outdoors? Is all my insurance premiums tax deductible, what about my HSA deposits?
Being my first year I am slightly hesitant doing the taxes myself. Especially after reading a thread that turbo tax has changed their subscription plans and I could potentially be buying two plans if I accidentally buy the wrong one initially. The other catch is that I have a full month salary from my previous employer when I was living in TN (no tax) but working in Mississippi (taxable). 

Onto what I need the guidance on; I’m wondering what my ‘best’ tax filing option is. The first option is using TaxACT with guidance from PF and filing myself, but like I said, this worries me because it is my first year.  The second option is going to the local tax office and getting them to help me out. The third option is to find a CPA or a tax preparer that specializes in the engineering industry to get the best bang for my buck. What would you suggest? And if it is the third, how do I find a CPA that specializes in my field for Louisville KY?

personalfinance,"Entering Medical School Aug 2015, FAFSA Confusion","1.) I am independent (&gt;25 years old and file taxes independently), but medical schools require parental information on the FAFSA form. Does anyone know whether I should fill this form out as though I am a dependent who lives at home (i.e. how many people should I say live in my household, and how many people should I say live in my parents' household?) Questions like #74 (see below) are confusing, because I'm technically not going to be a college student or living with my parents next year, but I think it still wants me to include myself in the count?

Question 73 -- ""How many people in your parents’ household (from question 73) will be college students between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015?
Always count yourself as a college student. Do not include your parents. You may include others only if they will attend, at least half-time in 2014-2015, a program that leads to a college degree or certificate.""

2.) This is admittedly the first time I've ever filled out a FAFSA form (my parents paid for college), and I'm embarrassingly naive when it comes to personal finances, so I wanted to get your opinions on this--my parents apparently have $1-1.5mill in assets, in addition to their retirement plans. That doesn't include our house value.

My dad claims $1.5 mill is ""nothing these days""...I think he's completely wrong and I will once again end up with no financial aid. Is he correct that the government &amp; medical schools would not consider much of those savings to be ""estimated family contributions"" that my family could cover? Or will I be screwed over by my parents' hoarder tendencies? Consider that I make about $40k at my current job, I contributed $10k last year to my Roth 401k and $5.5k to my Roth IRA, and I have about $5000 to my name in remaining assets. Do you think I would qualify for any type of financial aid considering my finances &amp; my parents' finances (need-based scholarships, subsidized loans, lower interest rate loans, anything???)

Assuming I don't qualify for financial aid, I personally (and I may be wrong on this) think it would be a mistake to take out unsubsidized loans that will accrue a significant amount of interest when my parents already have $1.5 mill in assets as well as an annual ""salary"" coming from retirement account distributions and social security (and pension too, I think?) I'm not sure if $1.5 mill is truly considered peanuts these days or if my parents just don't trust me to look after them in retirement, and thus feel that they need to hoard those extra dollars. What should we expect realistically in terms of financial aid, and how should I broach the subject with my parents?

3.) I have received an acceptance at one school so far, but I was also invited to interview at my state school (decision can come anytime from now through April 30th). Is it too forward of me to include the state school on my FAFSA even though I haven't and may not receive an offer of acceptance, and should I list it first since it is my top choice? Or will that piss off the school I've already been accepted to, thus hurting my chances at scholarships there? I'm not really sure what the purpose of ordering schools is...

personalfinance,"I want to take control of my finances/debt, but its all so overwhelming","I've studied the FAQ, and have a good idea of what I need to do, but I'm overwhelmed.  I need help, and I was hoping some of you might be willing to give a little advice/encouragement/whatever.  So here's my situation.

I make 45k/yr, my wife stays at home (she runs a small Poker business at a few different bars a few nights a week, but the income from this is negligible ~$20-40 a night).  We currently live paycheck to paycheck, still trying to recover from a brief unemployment bout on my part that drained our savings.

Here's what I need to do:

1) Open a bank account.  Our old account was closed when my direct deposits from my previous job stopped coming in.  My paychecks are currently being DD'd into an AmEx Serve card, but that was just a temporary solution.  I need a real checking/savings account.  I've been burned by BoA and Chase in the past, and don't know what good options out there may be.  My place of employment (U-haul) has its own FCU, but there's like no information on their website to determine if the interest rates on savings/etc are any good.  

2) Rebuild my emergency savings.  I know this is priority one once I have a savings account to stow away in, I just don't know how much to contribute per paycheck while also dealing with...

3) The major factor of being overwhelmed, my looming student debt.  $54k worth of it.  It was a deferred for a year after I got out of school.  I struggled to make payments, the ownership of the debt got moved around.  I struggled to get in touch with the company owning the debt.  Ownership got changed twice more, with me having set up an automatic payment from my old bank account to the last owners.  Ownership got changed YET AGAIN, and their hours of operation are not friendly with the hours that I work, and I need to contact them to work out payments.  Once that's worked out, I don't know if I should overpay the minimum amount to start attacking the interest, or what? 

4) I've got a little over $800 dollars in collections that I need to take care of ASAP.  I want to take care of it in a manner that removes it from my credit report in a positive way.  I was reading in the FAQs that this is difficult to do, adding to my worry.

5) My credit score is in the high 500s (which is terrible, I know) I have no credit cards, I have an auto-loan of $320/mo that's only got another 6-7 months left before being cleared, never missed a payment.  Rent is $500, Electric $60-100/mo (depending on how hot it gets during the summer).  Internet is $80/mo, and groceries are roughly $500/mo.  I know that should leave considerable breathing room with my current take home, but my wife and I are also smokers (getting started on patches in the next month) which ends up costing a lot.  I don't even know where the remainder goes.  I rarely eat out, bring lunch to work, and the only money I spend on entertainment is the ten bucks a month for netflix.  I will very very rarely purchase a video game, but I keep myself to sales only, and try not to spend more than $15 every three months or so.  I'm doing well on that end.  

6) We need a couch.  This is a non-negotiable quality of life kind of thing, we've only ever bought used couches and we only ever get about a year's use out of any of them before something breaks and makes them unusable.  I doubt my credit is good enough to finance a nice new couch, so I'll use Rent-A-Center if I have to.  Unless someone has a better suggestion.  

I know it seems like my situation isn't that bad, but I just can't seem to get a handle on my money.  I'm 31 years old, and I'm afraid if I don't start finding money to invest in my future, I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.",finance,1420486861

personalfinance,"General financial questions on debt, and how can I find out all accounts in my name, including investments?","Hi PF,

I'm starting to look at getting on top of my finances in 2015, and part of that is streamlining all of my investments/loan debts/etc.

I have a bit of an interesting financial situation right now: I have somewhere in the region of 120k in student loan debt. A good chunk of this (approximately 90k) is in my mothers name through a few Parent's Plus Loans. I'm currently in the process of trying to get this debt moved into my own name, as I am currently paying for it but not reaping any of the tax benefits. This is currently about $816 a month, every month down the drain.

I have another ~$22k in student loans in my own name through both private (chase) and federal loans. I contribute to my works 401k, but my work does not match at all. I believe (and correct me if I am wrong) This money would be better spent whittling down my student loan deb, which interest rates are higher than the return rate through my 401k.

I also have a few investment accounts that family members have opened for me. One was by my grandmother and one was by my Aunt. I recently moved the joint one with my grandmother into my name solely, and I'm not sure about the one with my Aunt. I don't even remember the name of the investors.

So my questions are as follows:

* How can I find out every account in my name, at least to discover these investment accounts.
* Should I stop contributing to my non-matching 401k in favor of paying off my student loans? If so, should I remove the money from it (I believe around 3-4k) and put that towards my student loans?",finance,1420488523

personalfinance,"Rate's low, but closing cost is high. Should I still attempt to refinance?","I have a house.

I have just bought it two years ago, and have the rate of 4.5% at 30 years.

I'm going through the refinance process, when I saw the Zestimate value going much higher than how much I paid my house for (I bought it at $247,000 vs $310,000 Zestimate value as of few days ago.)  I'm paying PMI right now as well,  so I decided to get rid of that and lower my rate at the same time (Refinance rate is locked at 3.99%.)

Well, the appraiser has come and gone, and he clocked it at a much lower value than anticipated ($262,000).  With that, I need to pay up a lot of money out of pocket if I want to get rid of the PMI--some $11,000, including closing cost, escrow fund, and payment to lower my balance below 20%.  

The calculator online says I'll break even at 54 months in, even before taking the PMI into account, so it would've been doable if I had money.  Problem is, I have some $10,000 net debt in credit cards (although most are in balance transfer offer, and debt has been slowly dwindling.)  I have some $7-8,000 in my checking account, and can fill in the rest with the help from my parents.

I am not really sure if I should proceed with this.  On one hand, it'll pay off (or at least break even) in the long run. On the other hand, that's a lot of money to ask for, especially given my situation.

So I see three ways out of here, I think.  One is to proceed with this, suck up the upfront cost, and pay off the increased debt slowly.  Two is to forget it.  Three is to pay up the difference of my current loan when the 2 year mark hits down to 80% balance and ask to end the PMI, which will probably save some 3-4 years of PMI payments (currently at some $82/month) but won't help much in terms of interest rate.

What should I do in this situation?

personalfinance,Financial Priorities (x-post with financialindependence),"I do well with lists, and I've been trying to connect the PF and FI subreddits for a ""master plan"" of sorts.  

I thought others might be able to improve it and/or would appreciate this laid out, so here it is. PLEASE tell me if you see changes or additions that should be made.

**""The Plan"", according to /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence**

**1.) Know what you're spending.**
&gt; For me, [mint](http://mint.com) is the standard for tracking expenses. Use a debit or credit card for all purchases &amp; pay off credit card purchases every month. Don't allow any transaction in mint to be categorized as 'Uncategorized'.  

**2.) Set a budget appropriate for your current financial standing &amp; needs.**
&gt; Needs, not wants. It'll feel better in the long term than it will in the short-term.  

&gt; For budgetmaking, [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com) is the standard on Reddit.  

&gt; There are other theories around what budgets should be for people with middle-class incomes. [50-20-30](http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/your-ultimate-budget-guideline-the-502030-rule) is a very simple model, others can be found or added [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2r8eg3/whats_your_favorite_budget_theory).

&gt; Once you know what your monthly needs are, I like to set up my direct-deposit 100% to savings, then I log in once a month to fund my checking account with my exact budget amount + a small buffer to protect against overdrafts.  It's a nice way to avoid seeing your savings as spendable income.  

**3.) If your employer does 401K matching, contribute enough to get the full matching amount.**
&gt; [Explained in the /r/personalfinance FAQ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_2.3A_employer-sponsored_matching_funds)

**4.) If you have any other current-year expenses that can be paid with pre-tax money, do so.**
*HSA*  

&gt; Health Savings Accounts (HSA) is an example of non-taxed money you can use for medical costs you know you'll have, like prescriptions and checkup copays.  

*FSA*  
&gt; FSA or Flex spending / Dependant Care accounts work the same way, but can be used for childcare, preschool and other child-related expenses.  Make sure you understand the difference between HSA and FSA.  Flex Spending is 'use it or lose it'.  HSA is a savings account that gets pre-tax money you don't lose, but can generally only be spend to medical expenses.  

*529 (college savings) plans*  
&gt; As of January 2015 in the US, 4 years in an average in-state public university, including room and board, is around $25K per year.  That's a total of $100K needed by the *end* of each kid's 4-year education.  Assuming a 4% increase in education costs, this means you need $215K in 18 years *per child*.  

&gt; If you're planning on making regular payments for the next 18 years for each child, and assume the cost increases above + 6% gains in the 529 plan, you need to seed a 529 plan with $9,400 the day the child is born and make monthly payments of $400 until they're 18. That's $95,800 contributed over 18 years, and compounding interest at 4% will bring that up to the $215K you need.

&gt; This is a scary number to look at.  But consider this - waiting until the child's first birthday to open a 529 account brings the seed needed up to $12,200 (+$2800), just to keep the monthly payments at $400. Wait 2 years, and you'll need $15,100 (+$5700 over day 0) to keep the remaining 16 years of payments at $400/month.  *All this to say - the sooner you start a 529 plan, the better.*  Start a 529 when your SO is pregnant, there's a 9-month jump on the process, and will bring the seed needed that much lower.

&gt; [You can compute your own 529 plan here.](http://www.savingforcollege.com/college-savings-calculator) and reduce your savings rate in other ways.  For example, I chose to only fund 75% my kid's education.  I don't want them to be saddled with incredible student loan debt, but I do think paying for your own education makes you take it a lot more seriously.  That plan brings a $7000 seed and $300/month payments per child.

&gt; If things don't work out with having a kid (they don't in 1 out of 3 cases), or it doesn't happen for you, you can gift the account or use it for your own education expenses.  Or withdraw it at a tax penalty, which isn't great, but better than the 529 going unused forever.

**5.) Establish an Emergency Fund.**
&gt; Step 2 above should leave you with some amount of disposable income every month.  

&gt; Contribute the full amount of your monthly disposable income into a subaccount titled 'Emergency Fund'.  Ask your bank if you don't know how to do this.  Do not use your savings account, because these are not funds available to you.  

&gt; Do so until the account = monthly take-home pay x 3-6 months (9-12 months for high-risk jobs)  

**6.) Pay off debt.**
&gt; If Emergency Fund is fully funded, work on debt with disposable income from Step 2. This will take a while, and is difficult.  Come see us at /r/personalfinance for encouragement.  

&gt; 2 approaches: Avalanche and Snowball  

&gt; Avalanche pays off highest-interest debt first, Snowball pays off lowest balance first.  

&gt; Avalanche is technically better, but Snowball brings a much higher degree of satisfaction with more frequent success events, which can keep most people from otherwise becoming burned out / quitting the process.  

&gt; [unbury.me is the standard for computing AValance and Snowball debt elimination plans](unbury.me)  

***You've graduated from the bread-and-butter situation frequently found in /r/personalfinance, welcome to /r/financialindependence, where the goal is to not have to work anymore! (simply put)***
&gt; Keep in mind that things happen to everyone.  You'll likely need to use your Emergency Fund at some point.  This will be the test of your resolve.  Dedicate yourself to re-funding your Emergency Fund in full, then cleaning up any debt you've accumulated while re-funding your Emergency Fund, and so on...*then come back to this point*.  This is a tower of wealth, you have to have that stable foundation.  

&gt; Technically, your road to Financial Independence started with getting your employer's full 401K matching amount in step 3, but from here on, we've dug ourselves out and start to concentrate on living off of interest. (aka, retiring / not working for a paycheck)  

&gt; This *is* applicable to you.  You can retire early!  

**7.) Max out IRA contributions**
&gt; The standard is a persoanl account at Vanguard, and see the [IRA FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) for more info on IRAs in general and why you want to do this.  

&gt; In the US, the IRS limits the amount of money you can contribute to an IRA per year. For 2015, this is $5,500. (Google 'IRA contribution limits for &lt;currentyear&gt;') Contribute the full amount of your disposable income into the IRA to that limit.  

**8.) Max out 401K contributions.**
&gt; This is a good time to make sure you're using the best 401k plans available, within your employer's offerings.  Previously, you were contributing the minimum amount to get all of the ""free money"" offered by your employer's matching plan, if they have one.  The [401k wiki has a good write-up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k)  

&gt; The IRS limits the amount you can contribute to your 401k, as well as the total amount both you + your employer can contribute.  For 2015, this is $18,000 for you, or $53,000 for you + employer contributions.  Google ""401k &lt;current year&gt; contribution limit"" for current info.  

**9.) Max out the kid's college fund.**
&gt; Given the expected education cost increases and expected rate of return in the 529 plans above, there's a lot you can do today to make the most of compounding interest.  For example, if you had $66,800 to invest on the day of your child's birth and seeded a 529 plan with it, that translates to $1/month contributions for 18 years, and a fully-funded college education ($215K) in 18 years.

***If you've reached this point, congrats.***
&gt; Now the goal is to accumulate enough cash to live off the interest.  AKA ""not working any more"", which is where PF subreddit leaves off and /r/financialindependence picks up.

**10.) Calculate what you need to retire as early as possible**
&gt; This sounds scary, but it's accepted you can get a 4% return on your money with someone like Vanguard.  Which means that 4% per year needs to = the amount you spend in a year...which means you need 25 times your yearly spending to invest in a safe 4% return account.  (4% return needed x 25 = 100% seed needed).  [More info here](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/faq#wiki_investing)

&gt; It's not as scary as it sounds. The house, cars, children's education expenses and other debts are paid off at this point.  If you look at your budget from Step 2 and remove all payments related to all debt, what's left is supplies and maintenance for the house, food, bills like utilities/internet/phone, insurance for people, cars and home, property taxes, and other ongoing use-based costs.

&gt; For me, my budget would shrink by about 40% if I removed all debt payments, which I'm working to do with mortgage, student loans, personal loans, and funding my 401k/IRA/529 accounts.  The money in my 401k and IRA accounts add into the 25x seed - and there's a few ways to get the money out of an IRA and into an early-retirement investment account at reduced tax rates. [Here's a decent ELI5-style explaination of one way to do this](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2arq5d/awesome_method_for_saving_taxes_on_roth_ira/ciy64pv)

*Extreme example*
&gt; You're ready to retire early now, but have quadruplets, and are looking at $267K in 529 account seeds for all 4 of them.  Evaluate what's better for you:

&gt; Using $267K to fully seed their accounts and taking $10.7K less per year in interest payments...or

&gt; Spending that $10.7K per year on 529 payments and seeding the accounts with $140K for all 4 kids (reducing your retirement income by $5600/year)...or

&gt; Not seeding their 529 plans at all and paying $22,320 per year for the next 18 years, meaning you need an additional $558,000 now just to pay for their college with your interest income

**11.) Put that retirement money to work**
&gt; As an example, let's say that you can live the life you want for $48K/year, while owning all of your assets and having no debt or other debt-related obligations, like college for the kids.  To earn $48K a year in interest, you'll need $1.2 million dollars.  Ouch, right?  

&gt; It's not as bad as it seems.  You're not going to stuff $12 under the mattress 100,000 times, of course, you're going to put it in an interest-bearing account, and [compounding interest is your friend...when you're the one holding the money](http://www.investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator).  We'll again assume 4% for reasons stated &amp; linked to in step 10.

*Example 1: college grad*
&gt; Let's say you're 21. You want to retire at 39, making $48K/year on interest. You need $1.2M in 18 years...but with a 4% interest rate, you actually ""only"" need to come up with $820.8K over the next 18 years, or $3,800/month.  It's a lot, but you're earning almost $400K over these 18 years in interest, which is quite a bit as well.

*Example 2: Start saving at 21, finish having kids at 30, retire when they go off to university*
&gt; Kids are out of the family house and off to college, and it's time to retire down to that beach house at 48 years old - great!  Starting at 21 gave you 27 years to get to that $1.2M amount you need for $48K/year of gas money for the boat + bait for deep-sea fishing.

&gt; Those 27 years make a big difference.  You'll need to put away $2060/month, contribute a total of $667.4K, and end up with $1.2M.

*Example 3: What you wish your Grandfather did.*
&gt;Grandpa is 21, and knows he'll have your father at 30. He knows your father will probably have you at around 30.  Grandpa wants a nice trust fund for his family line set up for your 18th birthday.  That's 57 years, and we'll pretend currency problems don't happen...

&gt; If Grandpa starts the fund for you, contributing $456/month, and gifts it to your father when you're born under the condition he continues doing so, you'll have $48K/year of interest money to do with as you please, starting when you're 18 and for the rest of your life.  They'll have done this for you at a cost of $311.9K, spread out over 57 years.",finance,1420496670

If it's NY, does it apply to me as a non-resident? I make about 70k/yr, how can a 40% income tax rate apply to me? 

I wanted to ""set and forget"" my retirement planning for the year, not gamble on an uncertain bonus and then have just 3 months to make up the difference if it's not as generous as I hoped in January. Is that what I have to do if I want to maximize the tax advantage of my 401k, or can I smooth my income, safely ignore the one-time tax hit to my bonus, and claim the difference between 40% and my actual tax bracket when I file my return?

personalfinance,Need an assessment of my current budget and allocating funds to appropriate debts.,"Hey all,

I came up with a budget a few months ago with all my bills and expenses for each month, but I don't think I am properly saving my money nor am I allocating money towards debt as I should. There are going to be changes in my budget come July, but I'll get to that at the end. The x factor is groceries, which I do not track but probably should. However I will note that I hardly spend a hundred a month in groceries and do not eat out.

I currently have $4073.67 in a regular savings account at my bank.

Each month I can save exactly $1200 a month. However in July I will only be saving $800 a month because I will no longer have a roommate paying half the rent.

My personal goal is to reach $10,000 in savings before July, but I do carry debt.

My debt is as follows:

* Student Loans - I owe $9,289.00 (Monthly payments of $120.00, Interest rate 6.55% on one the other is 6.8%)
* Car Loan - I owe $2,835.00 (Monthly payments of $145, Interest rate is 6.8%)
* Capital One Visa - I owe $1,597.45 (Monthly payments of $44.00, Interest rate is 23.15%)
* Capital One MasterCard - I owe $262.52 (Monthly payments of $26.00, Interest rate is 19.90%)
* Amazon.com Store Card - I owe $1,128.16 (Monthly payments of $38.00, Interest rate is 25.99%)

I find myself wanting to get a different vehicle, largely due to the need for additional storage, utility, etc. New baby is here and we are thinking about getting a pick up truck (wanted one for awhile). I wanted to bounce some thoughts off of yall to figure out what the best way to do it is, IF it's even a wise decision to begin with.

So my question is, would it be better to replace the camry with another vehicle or the corolla? I'm leaning towards replacing the Camry while it still holds some value, plus we would get out from under the note..However, just not 100%. Maybe it would be better to drive the Camry until it's wheels fall off!

personalfinance,Law Graduate in new city with eye towards PSLF (US),"Hi all,

I am moving to a new city in the midwest from Southern California and was looking for some advise in terms of how much money I should save prior to moving, and also budgeting/plan with my new income.

I will be starting an entry-attorney level with the federal government, starting at pay scale GS-11 (70,000 per year) in September.

Current Income:

•Work approximately 16 hours per week at $20 per hour. I plan on quitting my job in Mid-April or end of April. (Hoping to make atleast $5,000 pre-tax before quitting).

•Have $9,000 in the bank.

•$4,000 law school graduation gift to pay for bar exam

Expenses:

•$217,000 in student loans at 5.5 percent.
•7 months of rent until end of July (will move back to parents in August and moving to Chicago in September). = $4,550
•$4,000 bar prep exam
•~$500 for bar exam fees


Plan: 

•	Have at least $6,000 in September to cover moving expenses and emergency fund

•	Rent car to drive to new city instead of flying – I have a dog and a lot of stuff. Logic here is – the more I bring, the less I will have to buy. 

•	Rent solo-apartment (new city, I do not know anyone to roommate with) ~ $1,400 to $1,600 per month. 
	Looking for apartments where heat and water are included in rent. Also I will not have a car, so I need to live closer to work, which is downtown.

•	Consolidate my loans to payment plan eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)

•	Push maximum income to 401k and Roth IRA to have less income – IBR payment will be smaller.

•	Stay with government for 10 years to qualify for PSLF


Anticipate income increase from GS-11 to GS-15 with ~5 years (122k).

personalfinance,Options for reducing monthly debt payments,"My wife and I (with 2 teenagers from her previous marriage, and our 8-month old baby) are looking into buying a house. We just don't have enough room for everyone in our 3 bedroom apartment and baby will need her own room here soon. We've talked to a bank that offers the Rural Development Guaranteed loans which require no down payment. My wife is in school right now and with only my income we aren't able to save up much of anything for a down payment, so the RD loan is nice for us. 

The problem we are running into is that the max DTI for the RD Loans is 44% and I'm slightly over that with the price of the house we're looking at. Loan officer said to be safe I'd need to drop about $225 off the monthly debt payments. Right now I have a total of about $750 in monthly payments between credit card minimums and my student loans. My total balance on credit cards is about $23,000, one of them having an $8,000 balance with a monthly payment of $236. Other card monthly payments are $98, $69, $40, $123. It's the one card that's really killing the DTI. We own both of our cars outright, so no car payments.

I've recently consolidated the student loans, so that's as low as those monthly payments can be ($186). CreditKarma had a debt consolidation loan offer, but while it would save money overall, the monthly payment would be higher than what I'm paying now. Loan officer suggested talking to a credit union about a personal loan.

The sad thing is, the monthly mortgage, insurance, and taxes payment on the house we're looking at would be lower than our current apartment rental so we could afford it. Just need to lower the DTI. What would be some of the best options to look at for reducing the monthly payments? 

Edit: A few things I didn't mention before that were brought up below. I'm not worried only about monthly payments, we are actively working on paying down the cards, making more than the minimum payments each month, especially on the higher interest rate cards. For the RD loan purposes they're looking at solely the minimum monthly debt payments versus monthly income. We do understand that homeownership can have unforeseen expenses. My wife receives child support payments each month, which added into our household income are slowly letting us put some savings away that would go towards those things. However, those payments can't be factored into DTI for the RD loan because we're only putting it in my name due to some credit issues on her side from her previous marriage.",finance,1420513813

Due to an unexpected funding shortfall last year and ignorance/lack of initiative on my part in pursuing private loan options to cover it, I've had to cover it on credit cards. I have a job starting in June for $65,000 per year, monthly take home after taxes and contributing 6% to my 401k to match is going to be about $3520.

Current credit card situation isn't great but could be worse. I pay whatever I can in extra cash and have never missed a payment, Discover said I have a 674 credit score (last month) and CreditKarma says 705 (as of today). I have three active cards, no annual fees on any of them, in order from worst to best:

* Amex Blue Sky, $2380 / $3000 limit, 22.24% APR
* CapitalOne Journey, $614 / $750 limit, 19.80% APR
* DiscoverCard, $2060 / $2100 limit, 15.99% APR

I was on Mint and got an ad for a Chase Slate card, looked good so I applied with my new salary info. It was offering no annual fee, 0% APR for the first 15 months, and no fee balance transfers for the first 60 days. It asked specifically for amounts of requested balance transfers, and I entered the above info. I got instantly approved for a $2500 line, I assume that means I can't transfer all my balances but I can at least get rid of the Amex balance.

Between my part time job and my federal loan disbursement I should be able to cover my expenses this spring without having to add to the credit card debt pile.

I'm getting killed in interest charges right now and would love to alleviate it until I start making money in June. Once I do start earning money I'm going to aggressively pay down the interest bearing CC debt ASAP in order of APR and then pay down the Slate card monthly so it's at 0 by the time the 15 month offer runs out.

**Any idea on whether I'll be allowed to transfer my full balance to the Chase Slate (I'm guessing I'll be stuck with the $2500 limit)? If not, any recommendations for short term or long term ways to consolidate at a lower interest rate (maybe another card with an offer similar to Chase Slate)?**

Edit: CreditKarma is showing me an ad for a Citi Double Cash card in the ""Balance Transfer Credit Card"" section, 0% APR on balance transfers and purchases for 15 months, 3% fee on transfers (so about $75 to cover my remaining balance). Worth applying now or should I wait?",finance,1420531816

After reading though his paper (I just stumbled upon it) , I did a quick search on /r/investing for a discussion and couldn't find a previous post with 'Jeffrey Wurgler'. Mayhaps the overarching consequences of index funds could be an interesting discussion?  I have been generally reading a sentiment that 'index=good' on here as of late. 

* Wurgler's paper [ON THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF INDEX-LINKED INVESTING]( http://www.nber.org/papers/w16376.pdf)

* [TL;DR article](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/09/22/349586/did-nobody-ever-consider-that-indexing-was-dangerous/)

* another potentially relevant paper: [Regression Discontinuity and
the Price Effects of Stock Market Indexing](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2288184)

Seems that the basic assumptions are: 

* The amount of index fund $ is increasing exponentially over time - I believe the paper references ~9$ trillion (in 2010)

* Indexed stocks react significantly different from non-indexed stocks in the market once indexed

What do you believe are the implications? How is this changing the market?

Are all indexed stock being inflated? Is the market becoming more artificial? 

Could the increase of market index trading be hiding a looming market slowdown/crash - perhaps visible in the few dips with rapid recoveries in the last months? 

Or, can the proliferation of indexing help us weather changes in the market going forward in a good way? Is it possible we are becoming more crash proofed with a potential for increasingly rapid high volume rebounds with less scrambling and yelling everyone - even in big crashes?

Am I way off the mark? 

Perhaps an ELI5 style discussion could help with some insights.

personalfinance,How do I keep my life on track to simply finish college,"I am currently a 2nd semester freshman at an out of state university (the only one that accepted me). I went here instead of community college because I wanted to be with my gf that I have had for multiple years. The tuition for an out of state resident here is ~40k per year. I received almost nothing in the way of financial aid or scholarships from the school or otherwise because I have lived in poverty and squalor since I was 10 years old. My single mother has 3 children and makes an annual income of 0 dollars because she is disabled, with years of medical documentation to prove it, but was denied for disability income. I'm currently paying around ~12k per semester to go here after federal (un)sub loans and a perkins grant because my familial contribution is $0. I just landed a paid internship in a tissue engineering laboratory that regularly publishes papers with student names attached. 

Unfortunately, last semester my treatment resistant, (untreated because psychiatry isn't covered under medicaid here) major depressive disorder + bipolar I disorder hit a breaking point and I essentially broke down and failed almost all of my classes. I currently have a .993gpa... I'm under academic probation right now. The only reason I was able to attend this school in the first place was because my grandfather was gracious enough to cosign my loans, but he said he's not doing that anymore after my recent performance because he ""can't trust me to succeed when I'm clearly deranged."" I'm planning on staying over the summer in my school's state and working at the internship so I can become a resident of the state and receive the reduced tuition, but I don't know how I am going to pay even the reduced tuition with a shit gpa that the school will not forgive even with medical documentation, and no one to cosign my loans for me. I can't get the loans for myself because my credit is ruined due to my parents opening bank accounts in my name and getting them closed due to debt.

The tuition included a student insurance package that allowed me to finally see a psychiatrist after I completely broke down in front of my girlfriend and she forced me to schedule an emergency appointment. I'm currently on medication that is starting to really help me. I'm trying to utilize a freshman forgiveness policy to replace the failing grades I received.

My girlfriend is one of the few good things to ever happen to me in life and I am terrified that I am going to lose her because I can't afford to attend college because I was fucked from birth. I realize that accruing possibly upwards of 100K in debt is not ideal but that is seemingly my only option... How can I possibly keep attending this school with everything that is going on?

EDIT: to add some things I forgot to mention, moving back home and going to community college there isn't really an option either because my mother cannot support another person and my grandfather won't let me move back into his home. The only work experience I have is fast food and I can't support myself on that alone.",finance,1420536796

2. the KBB value for my car in OK/GOOD condition is - 23,000
3. I have a dent in my car which will cost $650 to fix
4. New Tires (has to be same quality) - $1000
5. Assuming they will charge me for scuffed rim and interriro scratches?

So what to do here....It seems there are three scenerios:

1. Do i purchase it out right at 26,500 and trade it in at another dealership and try to get them to come up on the trade in value with out buying new tires / repairing?

2. do i repair it buy new tires and turn it back into the dealership

3. do not repair or buy new tires and let the dealership charge me

personalfinance,Options for reducing debt,"I'm looking at options for reducing my debt. All told, I have about $17000 between revolving and installment debt.

The breakdown:

* CC1 - $2500@29.9% - $25/mo, but not sure with the current balance (0% currently, not sure when this ends)
* CC2 - $700@29.9% - $25/mo
* CC3 - $500@19.9% - $0/mo, no interest/payment until june
* CC4 - $500@18.9% - $75/mo
* Car1 - $3300@24.99% - $298/mo (11 mo remaining)
* Car2 - $9500@24.99% - $432/mo (28 mo remaining)

Yes, I realize that the interest rates are atrocious. They are due to recovering from a bankruptcy in 2011. The rates on the credit cards weren't an issue as I was paying them off each month and no interest was incurred until after the payment due date. However, due to a bit of bad luck, I ended up taking about a 15% pay cut, and didn't (and still don't) have an emergency fund.

I don't have issues paying the minimums, nor do I have problems with paying my current bills. Finding additional money to pay extra monthly has proven difficult however. I'd like to get out of debt and focus on an emergency fund.

Since it's near tax time, I anticipate having ~$3000 coming back, and additionally, I have ~$1700 in an ESPP account.

I see two options:

1) Pay off CC2, CC3 and CC4 with the money in the ESPP, and Car1 with the tax return. All told, that will free up about $400/mo which can then be used to pay down CC1 (~7 months to 0 balance). Once that is paid, create the emergency fund, and then start dumping the extra on Car2.

2) Pay off CC2, CC3 and CC4 with the money in the ESPP, and CC1 with the tax return and put the remainder on Car1. Car1 would take an additional ~7 months to finish paying, at which point, create the emergency fund, and then pay down Car2.

The reason I'm splitting out the ESPP money and tax return is because the ESPP money can be here in ~1 week, where the tax return is ~2 months from arriving.

Additionally, I will have an additional ~$2800 from an additional ESPP stock purchase July 1st.

I'm not attached to Car2, and have considered trading it in or selling it. I'm at the point where I'd break even on it, however I would need to replace it quickly. I don't consider a new loan an option until after the CC balances are paid down (and low for ~2 months) so that I can secure a better interest rate.

Any suggestions or other options? Is my thinking flawed anywhere?

Edit: Was thinking about it a little more, and I can increase my take-home amount by about $400 every other week if I stop contributing to my 401k, and cancel the contribution to the ESPP. I can restart the 401k contribution at any time, however I would not be eligible to re-enroll in the ESPP until July. Would it make sense to do either/both of those? I would be missing out on company match in both cases (50% of the first 4% in the 401k, subject to a vesting period which I'm not 100% convinced I'll ever see, and a 15% discount on the purchase price in the ESPP).",finance,1420565938

personalfinance,Why you shouldn't bother keeping emergency savings if you have excellent credit.,"Say you are a typical financially savvy person with a mortgage with a 4% interest rate, and a credit card you pay off every month.  Suze Orman tells you to keep a $10,000 emergency savings, so you do. 

Here's the thing: That fund is costing you money because you COULD make a hefty extra mortgage payment with it instead (or invest it in mutual funds, or whatever). At 4% interest, that $10,000 that is just sitting in your savings account COULD be getting you about $400 per year, therefore it is actually costing you $400 per year. 

Instead you should consider just going into credit card debt in the case of an emergency. Say your credit card has a 16% interest rate. Putting $10,000 on it in an emergency would cost you about $1,600 per year.

If the odds of an emergency in any given year are small enough, (less than 0.25, or one in four in my scenario), it makes sense to just keep your credit card handy for an emergency instead of keeping  emergency savings since the cost of using your credit card would only be four times more than the cost of keeping the savings.

So it all comes down to how likely you think an emergency really is, and what kind of interest rate your card offers you. I beleive that most people over-estimate the odds of an emergency (due to pessimism and loss aversion), and therefore are incurring a higher opportunity cost than they should be by keeping emergency savings.",finance,1420569805
personalfinance,Don't dread a Fed rate increase - hope for one! (Why a rate increase is not a good reason to stay away from bonds),"""Why do I want to invest in bonds with an imminent Fed rate increase?"" and its variations is a very common question here in /r/personalfinance.  If you are investing for the long term and are properly invested in an inexpensive bond index fund (average duration between 5 and 8 years, most likely) you should be hoping for a rate increase instead of dreading one.

Duration is the point at which you no longer care about yields and price changes.  If you are going to hold a bond fund longer than the average duration, a fed rate increase will cause a temporary price decrease.  The bond fund will replace the current bonds with those earning higher yields.  By the end of the average duration, all the old, lower yield bonds will be replaced with new, higher yield ones.  Higher yields = good.

So, stop dreading a rate increase by the Federal Reserve.  If your bond fund's (or funds') average duration is shorter than your investment time horizon, you win in the long run.  As always, attempting to time the market (or in this case, the Fed's rate increase) is a fool's errand.  It is always the appropriate time to invest according to your asset allocation, in which every intelligent investor includes bonds.",finance,1420570779
personalfinance,Bank asked me what a payment I made to them was for......,"I am doing a refinance on my house because I bought it at the bottom of the market in 2009 and we were very young.

Overall PF win, lower interest rate long term (will be selling in 5-7 years) and monthly cashflow to help fund retirement. I digress....

During the process the bank had ""one quick question"" they asked me what the two payments on my bank statements were for. This was one payment for varying amounts over two months. I also have my credit cards through them and that's what it was for, however it just boggled my mind that they had to ask me to send an email explaining to them that I made a payment on the due date for the credit card in which they issued me.

personalfinance,x-post from /r/student loans : Student Loan Garnishment + Tax Return Question,"Hi All!
Thanks in advance for taking the time to read/respond to this question - I really appreciate it!

My husband and I were married last August, and were planning on filing a joint tax return for 2014. This was great for us, because there is a fairly large income disparity between the two, and will result in a federal tax refund of about $4000 and a state tax return of $1000.

Unfortunately, my husband let one of his student loans (~$6,500) lapse into default (for the second time... already rehabilitated in 2012, now defaulted again). I didn't find this out until he had his first wage garnishment (15% of pay) on his most recent check. This means our household is out about $300 per month (give or take).

The questions are:

 * Will he be able to set up a new rehabilitation plan? I've read that this will usually need to go in conjunction with the garnishment, and we can probably make it work.

 * If he sets up the rehabilitation plan before we file our taxes, will they still withhold them to repay his debt? Will they withhold State and Federal?

 * If he can get the wage garnishment removed before April, and we wait to file our taxes, will they still withhold them?",finance,1420576215

I unfortunately had to stop working and go on government assistance (about 650.00 a month).

Recently, I was able to get my license back, and go back to my electrical apprenticeship, which has been amazing!

 I'm making 22.00/h right now at my job, but my father has been driving me in due to my car situation, but I can't keep asking him to do that, and personally, I need my own car. I have been looking at financing a vehicle, as I don't have the money saved up to buy one, and so far from the first dealership, for a used 2007 pontiac g6(on the lot for 9700.00) they said the lowest rate they could get me was 29.9% for a 10-12 month period, which is absolutely ridiculous in my eyes.

How to prevent the next major release of radioactive material from turning into a human disaster emerged as the most important consideration at the panel session on radiological protection at the WNA 2014 Symposium last September.

Bitcoin,How do you price a USD/Bitcoin forward contract?,"I have been lurking for a while and am pretty impressed with the caliber of this forum, so here's my challenge: I am having a hard time seeing how any crypto currency ever overcomes exchange rate volatility. Like most of you I am very excited by the potential of a decentralized currency, but I cannot get my head around the practical conundrum. 

The conundrum in a nutshell: liquid debt markets are the *sine qua non* of stable exchange rates, but volatile exchange rates deter borrowers and lenders from originating Bitcoin-denominated debt.  

How can an entrepreneur ever build a Bitcoin-based business if no lenders will quote them an interest rate on a Bitcoin-denominated loan? As a potential investor in a Bitcoin-denominated business, what baseline return would you demand on an investment with a 1-year payback period? How about a 5-year payback period? 

If you can’t hedge exposure to Bitcoin volatility then how can you even think about Bitcoin-denominated investments?

Quick primer on using debt markets to price forward currency contracts: the forward discount/premium between two currencies is driven by the ratio of interest rates on deposits, because a decoupling of interest rates and currency forwards would represent an arbitrage opportunity (with turnover of &gt;$4 trillion per day the global foreign exchange market is mind-bogglingly liquid; it reacts swiftly to new information and obvious inefficiencies are quickly traded away). 

For example, say the 1-year rates on USD and MEX deposits are 2% and 3%, respectively. If the current (spot) exchange rate is 15 MEX/USD, then the 1-year forward contract would be 15.14706 MEX/USD (15 x 1.03/1.02). 

The intuition behind this is that you could simultaneously (i) borrow 1,000 USD at 2%, (ii) trade 1,000 USD for 15,000 MEX, (iii) invest the pesos at 3%, and (iv) lock in the 1-year forward rate of 15.14706 MEX/USD. After one year you would receive 15,450 MEX (15,000 x 1.03), which after settling your forward contract would yield 1,020 US (15,450 / 15.14706), which is exactly what you owe on the original loan (1,000 x 1.02). Total wash. 

If the forward rate were anything other than 15.14706 you could generate arbitrage. Another example: if the 1-year rate were 15.1000 MEX/USD then by borrowing 1,000 USD at 2% and investing it as 15,000 MEX at 3% you would end up after a year with 1,023.18 USD (15,450 / 15.1000), which after paying your 1,020 USD loan leaves $3.18 of risk-free profit.

**Here’s my point:** deep, liquid debt markets are the ballasts of currencies. They stabilize long-term exchange rates so that borrowers and lenders are comfortable committing to long term investment vehicles. If long-term exchange rates are not stable (i.e.; tradable at stable rates) then companies are squeamish about doing business in foreign countries and trade is limited to short-term transactions. This is what we see today in the Bitcoin economy, with merchants swapping out Bitcoins for dollars immediately following their transactions.
 
This strikes me as a classic chicken/egg problem. For want of a ForEx market Bitcoin can’t develop a debt market, and for want of a debt market the ForEx market will never appear.

Disclaimer: I’m not an economist, but like most of you I have a strong amateur interest in economics. My ForEx background is largely academic (I structure commodity derivatives for a living).

personalfinance,"I'm about to make a big move and buy some property, clean it up and pay it off, and then buy a doublewide or build a home. I am 22 and I would love some advice to get this moving forward.","I am 22 years old and my wife is 19 years old. We are looking to start moving forward awful early and I'm sure there are a lot of things that we need to watch for and that we'll have need to learn. I'm ready to stop renting and effectively throwing my money away and start building equity. I have a great start to my credit with 2 credit card accounts and a student loan account in perfect standing. Bear with me because there is a lot of information going through my head right now so I'll try to get it all down.

Currently we make around $2,600 a month combined. I am due for a 45-50 cent raise in 3 months and my wife is looking into being a CNA (she's certified already) at the local hospital and taking a $4 raise in pay plus extra working nights and weekends. We don't have any money saved currently because my savings was depleted due to medical expenses. I figured up our money situation yesterday and if we cut back all of our excess spending we can hold back about $1,200 a month, and we may be able to do better than that by lowering our cable and phone plans some. So I'll factor $1,000 a month for anything that may pop up that we cannot avoid.

My current plan is to buy a 1 acre chunk of land I found about 3 minutes from town for $7,000. The plan is to purchase the home and pay it off over the next 8 months or so and then purchase a doublewide to put on the lot. The lot is wooded and will take a lot of work, which is perfectly fine. I will personally chop down as many trees and pull up as many roots/stumps as I have to to make this work. I am also planning on digging as many ditches as I need to for utilities and digging out the hole for the septic tank as I can to save money, as well as laying the block foundation and for the doublewide because I know that is an extra $8,000 if they do it. Cable, gas, electric, and water lines are already through the road. We will have to install a septic tank on this lot whenever we move into the housing stage.

Moving on to the housing stage I would like to pay off the property completely first and then start looking at doublewides. I was talking to a friend, who is a realtor, and she was telling me that if we own our property and it is in an area with the utilities, which it will be, we should be able to get a doublewide without a down payment, and since it is a doublewide and not a house we won't be required to have the extra insurance cost you would normally have for not having a down payment. Having our own property should also help us secure a lower interest rate.

I'm having a hard time finding what kind of prices I'll be looking at for getting the utilities run in and hooked up. Also septic prices seem to vary a lot as well. What kinds of costs will I be looking at that I may not know about that I need to plan for? Is there anything else that I might be able to do to make the installation of the home cheaper or more efficient?

I realize I'm making a very quick choice on something like this without savings and I may get a lot of people will probably tell me this but it is a decision we want to make and know that we can handle. We both have great job security and a wonderful family base to fall back on if we need help (which we absolutely do not plan on doing) and if it takes a little longer to take care of this that is okay. I am a hard worker and I will make sure this is taken care of and done right.",finance,1420594259
personalfinance,Trying to figure out what to do with my defaulted private student loan. Where do I request the original loan information? With the original company or suck it up and call the collection agency and request proof of debt?,"I attempted to look at past posts regarding this subject and can't quite find what I am looking for.. so I am going to attempt to get some info regarding defaulted private student loans from 2008.

At the tender age of 18 I signed my life away in student loans back in 2006. I just did as I was told and signed where I was told to sign, not really understanding the difference between subsidized/unsubsidized loans or federal/private. I did what I could as quick as I could to ensure I could meet the deadline for the summer starting date in June 2006.

 Fast forward to 2009- I become pregnant and do not work at the time. I knew about deferments/forbearance. At the time I was a few payments behind in Federal loans. No problem. They are deferred no questions asked. My private loans were in default approximately $1200 at the time and they refuse to defer unless I make the $1200 payment. Again no job at the time I was unable to get anywhere with the company.

Fast forward a year or so, The originating agency (Student Xpress Loans) transfers my information to AES (American Education Services). I contact AES to attempt to work something out and they have no idea who I am or where my account is and refer me back to Student Xpress Loans.. I try again a few months later to contact AES explaining that I am trying to work something out and again I am informed they can not find my information and have no idea where my loan information could be. I attempt to contact Student Xpress Loans and they refer me back to AES. Huge circle jerk for about a year until I am sold into collections. This account has passed through 3 collection agencys at this point and is now sitting with ConServ out of New York. 

I currently have a private student loan originally $45,XXX, that is now $48,XXX after accumulated interest by the collection agency on my credit. They are charging me approximately 9% a day making my monthly payment, if I were able to make it, around $300/month just in interest.

I am wondering at this point what my options are and how interest works on defaulted student loans (if what they are charging is fair/legal)

Which brings me to the point of my post- Where and how should I aquire my original information?

Also, not sure if it's worth noting the originating loans were taken out in Kentucky and I am now back in Missouri as of 2008.",finance,1420594285

personalfinance,My resolution was to really make a plan and get on track financially - tell me how it looks.,"Money has always been a great stress to me. My resolution his year was to really buckle down and start saving more. With that said, let me give some information about myself.

I am a 24 year old male about to turn 25. I have my associates degree. I earned that at my local community college. I was not able to jump right into working on my bachelors degree as I was already working full time while getting my associates and ended up being a caregiver to my dad shortly after I graduated. The past few years I was working a dead end job that I was only making between 30-32 before taxes. I spent the better part of a year applying to jobs before I finally got a great set up. I am now making just south of 40K a year, opportunities for advancement in a field I love,  and they will be paying 50% of my tuition when I hit my 6 month (3 more from now) so I can finish my bachelors. It is also a grade/step system so I will receive a raise every year at a fixed amount. I feel I am finally set up pretty well on that end for my situation. 

After taxes, mandatory pension costs, great insurance that includes everything at a very solid rate (less than 100 a month for everything including a $550 FSA) I am at 2000 take home a month. Here is my breakdown of my current finances. 

Rent/Utilities - $360.00 (regular)
Car Payment - $353.73 (regular at 1.99 interest rate)
Gas Card -$125.00 (average, will flux month to month)
Eating out -$100.00 (regular)
Payment for bed	-$47.00 (financing offer from store, 0% APR. I have 3 more years on this) 
Target Card/Other Groceries $75.00 (could flux)
Best Buy purchase one -$25.29 (0 % APR offer, done after March 2015 payment) 
Best buy purchase two - $27.08 (16 month no interest
 financing, done in June of 2016) 
Christmas purchases -$251.04 (four payments of this, final payment in April 2015, 0% APR)

All of that has me at a grand total of $1,364.14 leaving me $635.87.

Right now I have a few thousand in my checking, and about 500 in my savings account. My goal was to save $500 a month right now leaving me $135 to use as I see fit.  Once the Christmas payments and first best buy purchase are done I will have an extra 275 to do something with. I also have a paypal card that has a no interest, no payment balance of 1400 that I just took out on a mandatory purchase of winter wheels and tires. That is due in July of 2015 and I planned on using my tax return money to either pay all of it or the majority of it. I did not include car insurance in this as I pay it every 6 months and just paid it, plus it should drop a good bit with me turning 25. Right now I am not concerned with a specific retirement account as I have to contribute to my pension account and would like to get things back on track a little more before I do that.

personalfinance,$150k Student Loan Debt; 31 yo; HELP!,"Hi All,

My name is Mike, I'm 31, have a decent job (~93k per year) and live in NYC. I've been chugging along ever since Law School, moving up in the world in my realm (eDiscovery) and enjoying the ride. I've moved from making $10/hr, to $35k/yr, and should be getting a raise soon, hoping to be just above $100k/yr. All sounds great...then comes the debt.

I have $150k (131k, plus plenty of interest) in federal consolidated student loan debt, and am currently on income based repayment. My interest rate is approximately 7.5% on $117k of this, the rest at 4.625%. My loans are forgiven after about 25 years (so about 22 years left). I am not eligible for pay as you earn (though maybe if Obama's plan goes through). I have been happily paying my minimum on IBR; then the freak out starts.

I take home approximately $1950/2 weeks, after 401k, health ins, metro card, etc. My rent is $950/mo (sharing a 1 bedroom), utilities about $100/mo (just internet and electric), and $211/2 weeks for maxed out Roth IRA, and $400-600/2 weeks mutual fund investment. I've been trying to save, and went from almost 0 saved / invested / retirement, to just over $50k in the past 2 years (401k/Roth IRA/mutual funds [VSMGX Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund]). Not too bad. Through all of this I go out, I enjoy life, I travel. I am good at finding deals, but definitely not actively not trying to control my lifestyle through costs. I don't really want to change my lifestyle much. I'm 31 and want to experience life and travel. No need to go to the Ritz, but I want to go travel around and have real life experiences, be it staying at the local hostel.

I have several concerns. First of all, I'm destroying my finances through the interest on my loans. I know federal loans are great, but the interest at 7.5% is killing me. I could probably consolidate into a private loan at around 3.5-4.5%, but would lose all federal protections / income based repayment options. This would save me 10s of thousands of dollars in interest.

Right now I see a few options:
1. Get a better job, maybe up to 125k - I love my job, love the people I work, but the company is known not to be the best when it comes to compensation. I really do want to stay and intend to discuss with my manager, but I don't think I'll get anywhere near $125k. Have been here about 4 years, moving up in the ranks, from analyst, to a manager. I have great experience and sure could find a great job in ~2 weeks (eDiscovery has way to few qualified applicants, for the available jobs; it's a great market to be in).

2. Stop investing money in the mutual fund, but keep maxing out my 401k matching, and Roth IRA. This means no down payment for a house, or compounding interest for many years to come on a bunch of money.

3. Pay the equivalent to what I'd need for 10 year repayment (but not switching out of IBR in case I have job issues, or instability). This is about $1700-$1800 a month. I currently pay about $650/mo.

4. Refinance my 7.5% loans (not the 4.625% loans) for a 10 year private loan program (looking at SoFi) at a much lower rate.

5. Do a better job budgeting.

I'd love to hear your thoughts as I can't get the doom of these loans out of my mind. I know I do well for myself, but NYC is an expensive city (and I don't intend to move), and I don't want to miss out on my 30s paying down debt.

I've been making 50k/year for the last 2 years, but because of frugal living, I save around 80% of that into my savings accounts. Currently at 100k savings.

Other details
- Currently have no debt. Was lucky enough to get my degree on a scholarship.

- In my country, we have a compulsory savings plan we're supposed to contribute to, which is similar to the 401k plan. But because I'm self-employed, I'm not required to contribute. Because of this, literally all the money that I have are in my savings accounts. A piece of advice I've gotten is that I should place a bit of money in the retirement fund because the interest rate is much higher (2.5% p.a.), but I've not decided if I should do this yet, given that any money placed inside would be locked until I'm 65.

- Currently living in my parent's house. Hope to get a place of my own in future, but housing prices is pretty steep in my country. Currently aiming to get a medium-sized flat within the next 2-3 years, which can be attained at 95k-100k. Because I really hate the idea of being in debt, I've been thinking of using my savings to purchase the house in one payment instead of installments. I've had people tell me that this isn't a great idea though. 

While I've read up a little on investing, I don't have confidence in actually pulling it off. Furthermore, the idea of investing in stocks and shares not only sounds risky, but draining, given how one has to continuously monitor the market.

I really very much prefer to place my money somewhere safe, gain a modest return and then re-evaluate every year or so. Because of this, fixed deposits seem to be the best option for me. Last year, I placed 50k in an 12-month fixed deposit, which will mature with a 1% interest in a few months time. 

Lately though, I've been wondering if there's anything else I can do apart from fixed deposits. I've looked at perhaps investing in 1-year treasury bills (both from my own country and from the US treasury) as I've learnt that they're very safe as well, but the gains seems even lower than if I placed my money in a fixed deposit.

My current interest rate for that card is at a very terrible 18%, so I plan on getting a new card with a 0% intro rate and completely pay it off before the intro rate ends.

personalfinance,Paying off Loans,"Hi Reddit,
I recently refinanced my car through a credit union to obtain a lower interest rate (now 1.49%). In the process, I had to refinance $1000.00 over what was on the loan. This brings my loan balance to about $5800.00, but I was cut a check of $1000.00 for the difference. I can use that money for whatever I would like - logic would say to take that money and make a $1000.00 payment back on the car loan, rather than spending that money. However, I have other loans with higher interest. It's worth noting that my car is not an upside down loan - it is worth $10,000. The interest rate on my car is exceptionally low, and the amount of interest I pay on it in a year is next to nothing.

I have a mixture of student loans (around $12,000 now with varying interest rates from 4.8% to 6.0%) and a $1700 balance on a credit card (0% interest for almost a year yet).

My thoughts are to put that money against my student loans, since they are the highest interest and I would like to get that paid off. But, if I put it back against my car, it will be paid off before it becomes too old and depreciated (its a 2008 Honda civic right now).

Have been lurking on here for about a year now and already made some changes to my financial plan. Not sure if this is too much information, or not enough information or what, but would love any and all feedback!  

**Background and Budget**  
26, Chemical Engineer in NJ making 77,000 annually (+ variable annual bonus, has been between 3-6k), paid biweekly. Serious SO in a PhD program in another state (so not living together or with any joint accounts) with plans to get married when that's completed - about 3 years in the future. No student loans (my parents are amazing and paid entirely for my education), no credit card debt, about $1,500 left on my car at 2.25% with 2 years left (I previously put a lot more money toward this than I probably should have with how low the interest rate is, but oh well. Lesson learned.)

$3600 monthly takehome pay (minus 401k contributions, taxes, and insurance, and ignoring the two extra paychecks a year)
------------------------------
* $600/month rent (split house with 2 other roommates)
* $110/month utilities (internet, gas, electricity)
* $60/month car payment
* $220/month gas (drive a lot to see SO, and commute to work is 30 miles one way)
* $110/month car and renters insurance (actually paid in full every 6 months but for budgeting purposes...)
* $100/month travel misc (oil changes, EZ pass tolls, NJ transit, parking garages, etc)
* $150/month groceries
* $250/month restaurants/bars (could be lower but with long distance, we like our date nights, and I go out once a week for lunch with coworkers)
* $20/month gym
* $50/month charitable giving (NPR and other causes I value)
* $250/month misc shopping/fun money
* $180/month gifts and travel (have had and anticipate still having lots of weddings to go to)

$2100 total spending
------------------------------
$1500 Leftover

**Current account values and plan for 2015**  

**Emergency Fund**  


* $8,500 - Fully funded for 4 months of expenses

* In addition, I like to keep a $3,000-5,000 cushion in my checking account for non-emergency unexpected spending (travel, major car maintenance, etc.) I know I could budget for this and roll it over each month, but having the cushion lump has worked great for me so far. I usually keep the two extra paychecks and annual bonus towards that cushion.

* 2015 plan: Put $50/month to efund to keep up with inflation/painlessly build towards a larger fund in case housing/expenses change


**Retirement**


* $75,000 in Company 401k -Split between Roth 401k ~$17,000 and trad 401k ~$58,000

* $5,500  in Vanguard Roth IRA - just opened last year

* $20,000 in Defined Benefit Pension - all company funded, they put in 5% plus an additional 3% in lieu of 401k matching, + interest  


The first three years of my employment, I maxed out the 401k to the 17,500 limit. The fees aren't great, but they're not outrageous either. I only started the Roth in 2014 after reading more of r/PF and realizing that I'm probably better off with  a low fee Roth in Vanguard and all traditional 401k contributions. I also got a letter last year with my pension statement after I was fully vested and realized there was actually money there. I feel more comfortable with my retirement situation and decided to drop my contributions this year and save more money towards my midterm goals (future wedding, house, kids).  


2015 Plan


* 11% pretax to 401k (+ on the paycheck with our yearly bonus in April I up it to the max 30% for that one time) ~$10,000 total for the year

* $450/month to Roth - max contributions to reach $5,500


**Savings**

* $32,000 in taxable Vanguard account  (three fund portfolio plus conservative target fund 60-40 bonds-stocks. Overall mix is 30-70 stocks/bonds).  

* $500 in savings account for vacation fund - new as a 2015 resolution!  

I'm okay with the risk involved in investing savings because none of what I'm saving for is going to happen in the next 5 (or 10?) years - besides wedding expenses, and that's what the conservative target fund is aimed at (and knowing that I could just stop investing and save the traditional way in a savings account and have the money in a year). When my partner graduates, it's possible that we'll move to accommodate both our careers, so buying a house isn't on my horizon right now.  And I would love to be able to pay for my future children's education, but can't open 529s just yet, so am just socking money away without concrete plans for it except tentative future wedding, house, kids. 


2015 plan

* $1000/month towards Vanguard funds

* $125/month towards vacation saving + tax refund


Does this all sound okay? Are there other things I should be doing? Is the move to drop retirement contributions make sense or should I still be prioritizing that over everything else? I obviously want future me to retire well, but I also want future me to have a good life with my family before retirement. Optimizing my portfolio across all accounts instead of looking at them separately? I have no experience in rebalancing my taxable accounts - I adjust the contribution percentages instead of selling anything - anxious about short/long term capital gain taxes and all that. Is that an okay strategy or should I suck it up and figure out how to do it the other way?",finance,1420643912

* I've done some research on how much I'll be able to get for my truck and have found anywhere between $1,000-5,000, depending on trading it in to a dealership, or selling it privately and the vague differences of what kind of shape it's in (that was primarily through KBB, not sure how reliable that is).

* The truck is currently in my mom's name (due to my awful credit)  
  
* I'm likely going to have to go to one of those ""no credit, no problem"" kind of dealerships to get approved for financing, which I know probably means a higher interest rate.
  
I don't even know what *order* to go about things. Should I go to a used car dealership and find out how much they'll give me for the truck first? How do you time handing over your current car to whoever's buying it, and taking home your new car? I know of people who have rolled over the remaining balance on their current vehicle into the financing for their new vehicle, is that an option? Or is that a bad idea, desperation move? Should I pay off the truck with the money in my savings, then use whatever I get from selling it as the down payment on a new car? Or sell it first, then use whatever money I have from that to pay it off? Does it matter?

personalfinance,I have a high salary but only a basic PF plan. What should I do?,"Hi PF, thanks for taking a look. I’ve learned a lot here from just the occasional lurking over the years. 

I think I’ve done some basic stuff right but I’m not sure where to go from here.  

I’ve been a doctor for about 5 years. I’m in my mid 30’s, married, have a young kid (&lt;4yo), and my wife is home taking care of him. She’s an artist so her potential income in the future is probably pretty small but it’s OK because between my regular position and moonlighting (which has only a minimal impact on quality of life) I pull in about 285K per year before taxes. 

Here’s the financial situation: 

-We own a house. We live in an expensive part of the country but it’s not crazy. The mortgage plus taxes is about $2600/m, the interest rate is 3.4% and we have about 25% equity. 

-I have $120K in student loans but the interest rate is locked at about 1.9% 

-One car is paid off, the other has a loan with 4% interest.

-I’ve maxed out my yearly contributions to a 403b retirement account and have been putting in 10K a year to a 529 for my kid. 

-We have an emergency fund that would cover about 5-6m of living expenses, but my sense is that I’m very secure in my position. I have occupation-specific disability insurance.

-We both grew up in middle class environments and our families raised us to be disciplined and frugal, so there’s no CC or other debt and our spending is well within our means. But that also means there are no sizable inheritances coming our way.

So we feel pretty secure, and lucky. I’m looking at what to do next. I’m aware that these are basic questions that are mainly addressed in the FAQs but I’m not sure if my strategy should be different because of my high income. 

-I know I should have life insurance. I don’t know how much or what type. I know the general feeling around here is that Whole Life isn’t worth it (and I read the FAQs), but assuming my income stays where it is the (eventual) tax advantage seems like a big plus. 

-Should I have a financial advisor? If so, how do I go about finding someone? I have my disability through a NW mutual rep but it seems like there’s a conflict of interest there since he gets paid by selling me stuff. 

-Now that my emergency fund is adequate I’d like to start looking into investing leftover money at the end of the month but not sure how to start doing that. I have the option of a 457 retirement plan through my employer but I feel like I’d want access to this money before retirement age. I know only the bare-bones basics about asset allocation from reading through the FAQs but I guess I’m not sure if I should be more aggressive because I can afford to see my investments bottom out for awhile. 

Thanks for your ideas, PF.",finance,1420645442

personalfinance,21 year old starving artist with no degree looking to increase income &amp; gain financial independence.,"Hello, r/personalfinance. I might be pushing the limit of what questions to ask here (all financial/life plan/career related questions). If I'm pushing the rules, sorry. You can delete it if it doesn't belong here.

I'm a 21 year old artist (visual art + music) who's lucky enough to still live at my parents' house. No degree, and currently make $8.50 an hour at my job with a 20 hour work week. So, give or take some holidays/some time off, I can make around $8,000 per year as of now. Around $4,000 saved up so far.

I'm generally looking to increase my income and get money faster so I can be completely financially independent and actually be able to do whatever the fuck I want and not worry about money.

My skills are music stuff (fairly competent musician, can play a few instruments) and visual art/computer related stuff (some graphic design skill/able to do things like photo editing/some video work and can manage social media/most any other computer stuff that doesn't involve programming).

I'm extremely self-disciplined and I am CONSTANTLY learning and studying. I have stacks of books and ridiculous amounts of website bookmarks/educational YouTube video playlists that number in hundreds of videos. I work, study, sleep, repeat pretty much. I don't go out much either, and I generally save around 80-90% of my income in the bank now.

I'd like to sell my talent (my songs/artwork, presence and music performance), be financially independent and be able to have a place to live, be able to pay the bills, and have a good amount of extra income flowing in. Obviously hitting it big and ""making it"" in terms of art/music is everyone's dream, but I'm happy with something above $8k a year, which is what I'm currently making. If nothing else, I'd like to increase my income to maybe $30k or $50k a year so I can have some money to take financial strain off my parents, and afford musical equipment (music stuff is generally pretty damn expensive).

**TL;DR:**

**MY QUESTION:** What would be the best ways to make money off of my art/music, or increase my income to something much higher than $8k a year? I want to live more comfortably in the future, possibly trying to reach up to a $100k salary or more in the future, but alright with increasing to something like $30-$40k in the meantime. Honestly, anything better than my current $8k a year is fine, but I still want to increase that by at least a couple thousand.

**CURRENT SITUATION:** 20hr work week, $8.50/hr, around $8k a year. No degree, but have some talent/skill and an extremely disciplined and rigorous self-educator. Have some skill/knowledge in art/music, but I'm still learning more. Fortunately still live with parents who pay for food/insurance/cell phone/gas etc.

Should I go back to college? I'd be terrified about debt, as art schools can be crazy expensive, and I'd likely have to take out a loan. I want to educate myself more and improve (and I self-educate with books and other info constantly), but even regular, singular non-college classes (for art/music education) can be expensive as well.

I'm fine with tough love; I'm 21 and I still don't know crazy amounts about money yet. And I know they say the music industry is reeaallyy tough, but I've been doing a crapton of research and it seems to me that it IS tough, but it IS possible to succeed in it if you're willing to put in work and time. Both of which I'm willing to do.

If you could help me out with any advice, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you so much.",finance,1420646856

personalfinance,Looking to buy house in 1-2 years. Need advice.,"Hey /r/personalfinance! I had a few questions and was looking for some advice from you guys. My wife and I are looking to buy a home in the next year or two. We have 3 children, and are looking for at least a 4 bedroom. Home prices in the area we live aren't outrageous (200-300k in nice neighborhoods 4+ BR). We are looking to pay our debt down as much as we can, an eliminate what we can before we apply to make our debt/income ration more favorable for the loan, and to improve our credit score. My credit score is good (746) but my wife's suffered previous to us being together (medical bills). She has no credit cards currently, has never got a car loan until recently, and was struggling until we met. I am asking for some help as to what we need to budget and what is best to pay off/what order.

Our static expenses currently are:  
Rent: $955  
Cable/Internet/Home Phone (need home phone for work): $150  
Electric: ~$120  
Car Insurance: $170  
Cell Phones: $100   
Credit Card #1: $25 ($906.18 owed with 19.99% interest rate)  
Credit Card #2: $25 ($938.72 owed with 19.99% interest rate)  
Credit Card #3: $25 ($613.88 owed with 26.99% interest rate)  
Credit Card #4: $25 ($1529.15 owed with 13.99% interest rate)  
Car Payment #1: $243.75 ($$6,439.43 owed with 10.99% interest rate)  
Car Payment #2: #$248.60 ($13,796.83 owed with 4.79% interest rate)  

I know the interest rates are high. Three highest Credit Cards I got when I had shit credit. Same with car #1. Car #2 is higher because my wife is on the loan as well.

Right now we bring home $4,000/month. My wife is switching jobs soon and that will add another $1,000 to our income, bringing us to $5,000/month. We don't make a ton of money right now, but I just switched career fields and she is moving to the same company that I started with as their is a ton of growth potential and their benefits and perks are fantastic. We currently have an emergency fund with $7,550 in it that we do NOT want to touch for any reason, and we have an account saving for a down payment for our home with $27,315. My question is, should we continue to contribute to our home/emergency fund, or take that money and apply to our highest interest cards to eliminate that debt, followed by the Car#1? With tax season rolling in we expect a decent return that could pay off all CCs (we have since changed our tax deductions to follow more in line with what we have learned here on Personfinance recently). Any advice relating to this or homebuying or anything would be fantastic. Sorry for the wall of text.

personalfinance,"Tax and Debt Issues, Please HELP!","Dear PF,


I need help with some major financial concerns in my life. Let me start of by saying I was never educated on finances whatsoever outside of high school economics. Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about finances and starting to plan for the future. I have conducted very minimal research here on the basics of personal finances and what I “should” be doing. Anyways, here’s my situation:


I’m 25 years old with a soon to be wife and an infant daughter. I completed a high school education in 2008, and proceeded to take several college classes for a career path I’ve abandoned. I’m about 20 credits shy of an AA degree - in a field I am no longer interested in.


My biggest issue and concern is the fact that I’ve never filed my taxes. I know, I’m a terrible person.. Again, I was never taught about anything related to personal financial management.


Anyways, I worked briefly at various points from 2007 to 2010. Mostly bullshit positions such as Subway, Quiznos, etc as a teenager. I never worked for more than a few months at a time during this period, and never felt the need to file for a tax return. I never filed exempt, so I did pay taxes every time I worked.. Just never filed for a return or refund.


In 2012, I worked a strictly commission based position for about a year as an “exempt” employee. My reasoning: I was young and dumb, got a DUI which was very expensive including the court and class fees, and needed all of my money to get by. This was probably one of – if not thee biggest mistake of my life. Long story short, I never filed that year as I owed money and didn’t have the means to pay it back.


Fast forward a couple years - I’m working a somewhat decent (without a degree) position as a Recruiter making $40k salary + commission (which is taxed 40%), and have been working steady for more than 2 years. I have been claiming 0, so they take more out of my checks – but I still have not filed taxes because I’m afraid of what will happen next at this point, so I’ve just been putting it off.


I do plan on filing this year, and am seeking advice on what to expect and how to approach and hopefully tackle this major obstacle in my life. I know that I owed about $2k from working exempt in 2012, but have been paying taxes for years and never received a refund so I was hoping that the refunds I “would have” received from filing the last 2 years will negate some of what I owe.. Is this the case? From what I understand, there’s a penalty for each year of unpaid taxes.. I believe in California it’s 5% per year up to a maximum of 5 years? So I’m anticipating (and hoping) what I owe for 2012 would be no more than $2,000 x 15% (for the 3 years it’s been). Again, I’m not sure if this is the case.


1.) Does anyone know how this would play out in my situation? 


2.) Does my recent taxpaying help negate what I owed in 2012? 


3.) Do I lose all the money I paid into taxes for not filing in previous years? 


4.) Do I have to pay the full amount owed from 2012 before accumulating any sort of refund?


5.) Can I set up a payment plan at this point, or am I at the point where I better have the money owed upfront before even thinking about filing or contacting the IRS to settle this?



I don’t know the exact amount, but I’ve been making $40-50k the last 2 years, and $10k-$15k of that was my commission which is taxed at a 40% rate. 


5.) Does the high tax rate for commission mean more of a return at the end of the year?


I would love to be able to pay off this debt, and be able to file my taxes this year and hopefully collect a return. Again, I’ve been claiming 0 this entire time. My fiancé will be claiming our daughter and head of household this year even though she makes less than me, just so that we are guaranteed a return.


I also have some debt to pay off: $500 on my Wells Fargo College Credit Card, and $1200 on a Capital One card with a very high interest rate (22% + ?). I want to work on paying off my debt via the avalanche method, but obviously I need to deal with my tax situation. I do have a small amount invested in my 401k, and eventually would like to setup an IRA and a college fund for my daughter.


Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!


TLDR; I’ve never filed my taxes, and claimed exempt in 2012 which I still owe the money. I want to pay off my debt to be able to collect a return in the future (hopefully this year, if possible)

My home was purchased as a foreclosure for 104k during the initial ‘first time homebuyer’ tax credit and received money from the govt and fixed/upgraded the house.

At this point he has around $70,000 in student loans. $10,00 of it is federal and $60,00 private loans from Fannie May. He is going to be paying a total of $450/mth. $400/mth for the private loans and $50/mth for federal. He's going through a divorce and is currently paying child support so his net income comes out to about $18,000 per year after taxes + child support.

I qualify for a loan of $8000, it says APR of 14.29%, interest rate 11.44%, 36 monthly payments of $263.58. Would it make sense to go through with this loan, and use it to pay off all of the above? Or should I keep things as is and start paying down the highest interest rate credit cards first? Thanks in advance for your help. edit:formatting",finance,1420666791

Bitcoin,WTF ppl?! Bitstamp has FUCKED people over. Congratulations for not going full MtGox?! WHO SAYS THEY HAVEN'T. Stop sponsoring this!,"The title says it all. There's been no acknowledgment of the hack's details and it's sickeningly obvious to everyone - whether you admit it or not - that something is very, very wrong here.

Everyone (most, I should say) here has major issues with the banks treating people like shit. All the terrible things banks do are paraded through here daily, and we're told Bitcoin is a panacea for that greedy, statist elitism. Maybe, maybe not. 

One thing is certain though: Bitstamp is acting just as badly as any bank has or does. This is not a time to pat them on the back. Being dripfed pieces of news and given meaningless deadlines is not how this is meant to work, right? **what is the point of Bitcoin's decentralized nature if another exchange is holding people's money?** (and God knows if that money is even there!)

Bitstamp, MtGox, inputs.io, Instawallet, etc etc: the same pattern for 6 years and it's still happening! Why? IMO because while people are happy to complain, there clearly isn't enough pressure on Bitstamp to do the right thing. I don't have the solution, as I am beginning to believe these issues may be flaws with Bitcoin itself: it seems to be impossible to secure.

Bitstamp is not in the right here in any way shape or form. 

*What do I suggest be done?* : **stop congratulating Bitstamp. Stop looking for the silver lining, and last of all: THINK RATIONALLY!**

personalfinance,(US) Student loan payment minimums?,"The title doesn't really indicate the whole story, but it's the best I can think of. Also, I checked the FAQ and the student loans section, but I didn't see anything covering my question.

So, a long time ago, I decided that I wanted to be the first in my family to go to university. I was encouraged in this by my family. Unfortunately, my family didn't understand how university or student loans or much of anything else worked, but I trusted them, so I let them handle my money. I was young and dumb, I know.

Fast forward: I ended up going to school and quitting multiple times (due to my father losing his job, among other things). There just wasn't enough money. Now I've managed to get a decent job, by some miracle, and I've settled down, so now the student loan people are able to track me down. I was under the impression (thanks to my parents) that my debts were mostly paid off, and I was planning on going to school again to further my education and hopefully go from a decent job to a great job.

This was not the case. I found out about a nearly $20k debt that I previously had no idea about by way of suddenly getting garnishments on my paycheck. This took me to making around $80 a month post-bills. I've taken to giving plasma to have any kind of buffer money in case of emergency. I managed to handle that, though, because after all my bills were still getting paid, I just didn't have any room for fun. I've learned a lot about finance and I would much rather be debt-free after a few years of not-fun than the alternative, I assure you.

But now I have another company that has gotten in contact with me (yes, I have since found out and gotten ahold of a complete list of my debts, so no more surprises). I couldn't consolidate, so they're wanting literally more than I can pay as a bare minimum. I tried to tell them that I couldn't pay much, but they won't take less than $148 a month. I do not have $148 a month until after my garnishments are lifted - though, even if they did wait, it would mean that I'd still be making the same amount over bills that I am now, except this time it would go on for the next four years. If they garnish me for being unable to make a payment plan, I will end up homeless - and I don't live beyond my means, which rankles beyond words can say.

Is there anything I can do? I always heard that they have to take whatever you can give to prevent exactly this kind of situation from happening. Please help me. I feel like dying might be the only way out.

Sorry for rambling. I just don't know what to do.

personalfinance,Which debts to pay off with an unexpected $20k?,"I found out today I will probably be compensated approximately $20,000 in addition to having monthly income increase of approximately $600 per month. 

I owe approximately $12,000 in student loans. My wife owes approximately $25,000. We have two cars which we are making payments on. I am not sure on the interest rate of these but I know we have like 5 more years of payments on both of them, and that the payments are approximately $450 for each. We also are currently paying into our third year of a 30 year mortgage for a house. 

We have a saftey net already saved. We can make all of our monthly payments at this point and our savings are slowly increasing. 

My assumption is that paying off one of the car payments would be the wisest choice, as the cars have the highest interest rates and paying one of them off would get rid of a $450 dollar payment each month. I just wanted to check here to see if that is wise. 

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.",finance,1420671937
personalfinance,Shady practices by my student loan servicer.,"Right out of college I got a job and saved up some money. I wanted to avoid later interest payments on my federal subsidized student loan (not very much, but I still wanted to avoid it, and felt it was how I could use my money most productively at that point in time), so I paid off $1000 of the $3000 I owed. I realize this is a tiny amount compared to most people, I was very fortunate, but it's the principle of this thing that matters most to me.

I was working and had money in my bank account, so I didn't bother to make sure that $50 was being taken out of my account automatically every month to pay off the rest of my loan. I vaguely remember some statements coming in saying that $0 was paid, and that bothered me a little bit, but I remember feeling that there away no reason that my payments should have stopped and just writing it off as a mistake or glitch or something. A full year after I made that $1000 payment, I was actually having some money troubles after a vacation and struggling to find work, so I decided to check up on how much of my principal I had paid down on my student debt. Turns out, unbeknownst to me and without my permission, the company that was managing my loan had postponed my payments for a full year. I imagine this is because they were expecting a certain amount of interest to come in, and they wanted to collect on that interest.

I find this deceptive because a) they didn't inform me they would be doing this and b) what reason would I have to pay off a lump sum of my debt, if not to avoid that very interest? I feel I am owed one year worth of interest on that principal that I paid down by $1000. What do you guys think about this? Is this money lost forever, or do I have a chance of getting it back? It's more the principle of the thing that's pissing me off about this.

Some of you might say that I should have been more diligent in checking up on this. I'd say I agree but it's a two way street. They can't put the ball entirely in my court, and if I set up an automatic monthly $50 payment plan on my student debt then they should have to keep that up. I don't want to have to check my bank statement every month to ensure that the $50 was taken out.",finance,1420672843

I'm looking to attend college in America as it would be a dream come true for me. I realise this is probably not going to happen but I'm going to explore every avenue to try and make my dream a reality.

I do **not** have an exceptionally wealthy family, we are ok but we do not have a ridiculous amount saved up that can send me to college happily. In fact I would not want to burden my parents like this.

My grades are average/good. Not incredible. I don't know how familiar you guys will be with the UK Edu System but for my A-Levels I'm expecting to get AAB or ABB. I also suck at Maths and don't study it any longer because of the way the UK System works.

This means I will not be able to get a free ride type deal.

I am not eligible for a US Student Loan obviously because I'm from the UK and the UK won't fund a student loan either. I'm looking at maybe trying to get a private loan but I don't really understand all this much because I've never really experienced it.

After looking through some loans they actually seem affordable. Such as an $80000 loan costing £356 per month, this would be paid by my mother, father and myself which seems achievable honestly. However this is over 20 years with an interest rate of 10%.

Would it be possible to get a lower rate of interest if the company was informed this is technically a student loan?

Which of these two loans would you say is the better deal for example?

I'm super confused with this stuff and haven't discussed it with my parents yet because I'm not how they will feel about taking this loan out if it's even an option.

personalfinance,"A few questions: retirement, tax bracket, student loan, saving for house. Question and recommendations.","Multiple questions and pertinent information. 

1) If my gross income is $93k and I put 4k into my 403b, does that put me back into the 25% federal income tax bracket?

Debts
41k in student loan debt between 3 federal student loans all at 6.5% interest rate. Two have near equal balance at around 7.5k, the third is 26k. 

Savings
Approximately 15k after purchase of engagement ring sitting in account not accruing interest. 

403b
Employer match 100% of first $1000, 50% of next $3000. Will increase percentage slightly to get close to the $4000 or slightly less for the year. 

Roth IRA
No contribution yet for 2014. Have 13k currently in a Vanguard 2050, have not contributed for many years due to return to school and saving for emergency fund, other expenses, and ring.

Currently live in home owned (financed) by girlfriend. There is perhaps 10k in equity should the house sell for exactly what she paid for it. Would like to move to new house sometime next year, let's say around 18 months from now. 

Of the 15k cash, I would like to keep around 10k available for emergency fund and 3k in my checking account. 

My plan, although likely not perfect (just checking to make sure not totally stupid), is to try to put $4000 into the 403b by April since it is matched and partially matched money. This will not significantly reduce available cash as I am currently contributing 3% and recently received 3% raise. Will contribute 6% through April. I have a minimum of 2-2.5k available each month after expenses. I would like to take whatever I have available above my 13k combined comfort limit and put a portion toward student loans principle (the largest 26k) while maxing the Roth IRA for 2014, so lets say around 50/50 until April. After April, I would work toward putting all excess cash toward the student loans. At that point however, I'm stuck between saving for a down payment on a house or paying off the student loans. It is doubtful I could save up 20% for down payment regardless. Would it be reasonable to start focusing on saving at least a portion for down payment on the house when the loan amount is approximately half of what it is now rather than paying the loan down aggressively?

So Here We Go!

Welp. It was a late night a few days after Christmas, and now owning a Visa Gift Card (Walmart), I decided it wouldn't be the worst idea to try some Online Paid Porn (Im 17, so Im not sure if this would cause legal issues). Wouldn't ya look over there! Online porn with a free trial! No charge if canceled within 2 days! So I decided to use an Empty Visa Card to try it out. I accidentally used the wrong one, one with ~$50 on it. Once I get my account set up, it was for a different website than advertised. I immediately emailed Customer Support, and got a cancellation number (All of this happened within 10 minutes of purchase ). *Phew*. Load off my fucking mind, right? Haha, I wish. When I check my balance the next day, $45 dollars is being withheld from my account, listed as a 'Pending Transaction', I quickly Wikipedia what it is. (Im not going to explain it to you as you have access to Wikipedia, and I hope you know what it is if you are going to respond to this). Long story short, Wikipedia says it should be lifted within 5 Business days (Since service was cancelled). So I wait. It was 'supposed' to be lifted last night at around midnight. Instead is goes though with the transaction of $45. This is billed to a different 'thing' than the other two websites. I have called the Support line for the Visa Debit Card it was charged to, and they requested me to submit a Transaction Dispute Form.

Long story short, I dun goofed, and what should I do to fix it? Should I just submit this form and hope for the best? I doubt trying customer support will help, as they said it would be cancelled, even gave me a number.

personalfinance,"Would like some advice on my current situation. (New career, some student loans, some money saved)","I was wondering if I could get some advice from all of you on my current situation.  I graduated from school last May and started a job in June and am not quite sure what to currently do with my financial situation, which is the following:
___
Salary: $55,000

Student Loans: $15,000 (@5.8%)

Savings Account: $12,000

Savings Bonds:  $28,600 (None at final maturity date yet, but plenty passed their purchase value)

Rent/Utilities: &lt;=$500/month
___
I am paying 500$/month towards my student loans and that is the only debt I have.

I'm currently living in a house with a few people I knew previously and our rent is incredibly cheap.  I play 380$ in rent and utilities on top of that.  Usually around 450$/month (the 550$ figure is the most I have payed so far).

I am living/working in an area where the housing market is exploding.  I'm in the architecture/engineering/construction field and know that many of the new apartment buildings going in around the city are going to be rent only and house prices are skyrocketing.  My goal would be to eventually live closer to downtown than I currently do.  I would absolutely love to live in an apartment building and have no problem with a 1 bedroom place.  I don't need much space and I don't have many things.
___

**So this gets me to my actual question.**

What would your advice be on the best course of action?

I understand that paying more than the maximum on my student loans could be dumb if I can take that extra money and invest it elsewhere with a return greater than the loan interest rate, but this is obviously not guaranteed.

Some of savings bonds have a pretty bad interest rate (ranging from 1.34% to 4%).  I'm not sure if I should cash in the majority of the low ones and try to move them elsewhere?  

As much as I love how little I pay in rent right now, I would love to move into my own place and potentially own it as soon as I can.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I wasn't sure what all I should include.  If you have any questions or want any additional information, I'll respond/edit as soon I can.

personalfinance,[Debt] Need help with a delinquent private student loan situation (TERI),"Ok, so this is kind of a long story, but I'll try to make it short. During my second semester of college, I took out a private loan for some reason -not sure if there was a federal conflict or what but for some reason it was private instead of federal. It's curious, though, because every single student loan since then has been federal.

Well, at some point, TERI went bankrupt and sold my account to another creditor. I was in Iraq at the time (and the repayment was on hold), things got lost in the shuffle, I don't know exactly what happened. Anyway, in 2013 I got calls from a debt collector telling me about this $20,000+ loan that I owed to Galaxy International (who had apparently purchased it from TERI).

I was frustrated at the amount they were claiming, and rather naive about the situation, but I stated that the original loan couldn't have been that much, and they told me that it had accrued interest.

Anyway, they said they could make a settlement with me for around $15,000 if I agreed to pay $308 each month starting then. So I agreed and set up an auto-draft. Now, what they failed to tell me was that after a year, I'd have to re-authorize the auto draft (which makes sense). BUT, I live in Asia currently as an ESL teacher and have limited means of being contacted.

So after the 12 months of paying on the loan had passed, the payments stopped - without me knowing. Fast forward to December and I get a call an emails from the debt collector (Enterprise Recovery) sayign that we urgently need to get back on track - and that because ***I*** stopped paying, the deal is off and the amount is back up to $20,000+. Annoyed, I agreed to pay again, but vowed to look into things and be back in contact.

One month later, my brother (who has no relation to any of my finances) gets a call from Jenae in Colorado (Alpha Recovery Systems) stating that they need to get in contact with me.

I call them back and they tell me that now ***they*** are in charge of collecting on my loan, which is still owned by Galaxy International. I get upset and dispute it for a bit, since just a month ago I made this payment plan with a different company. This woman is a total b*** but agrees to call Galaxy International together.

The GI lady also picks up the b*** vibe and asks to speak to me privately. She confirms that I had a deal to pay $308 a month on a $15,000 settlement, but that deal was nulled when I stopped paying. I told her that it wasn't my fault, and explained the situation. And she says theres nothing she can do since ERS no longer is affiliated with them. And that if I want to get this taken care of, I'll need to come up with a new settlement with ARS.

She advises to call back ARS and speak with a supervisor. So I do. He is calm and understanding but gives me this big spiel about how they can't do a payment plan anymore. What they need is a lump some payment to ""knock this thing out *this* month"". I tell him I have no money saved for that sort of thing, especially not at $14,000 which is what he's telling me he can settle for.

He then goes on to say that my mom (cosigner) is what they call a ""big one"", meaning she has impeccable credit. If I can't pay this $14,000 now, then they'll go after he for it. I insist that I can make monthly payments and want to leave my mom out of it. They insist that if I don't pay it all off now, they'll cease contact with me and go after my mom for a lump sum.

I get pissed, negotiating ensues. He tells me that my mom has like $40,000 of available credit (isn't that some kind of disclosure violation, btw?) and I have much less.

He suggests that my mom take a loan with the state credit union that she's a member of and that I make new monthly payments on the new loan (which would probably have a lower interest rate).

I tell him I live overseas and that she'll never go for that  much. I ask him the lowest number he can settle for. He says he can settle for exactly $11,745.23 if we pay now.

He says I should pay that ASAP, and says that the doc will say by tomorrow, but really I have til the end of the month.

Now. My head is swimming and I'm not sure what to do. I really **don't** want to get my mom involved, and I also feel like the collector is lying about the extent he'll go to to collect this debt in full from my mom, especially if I start making payments to them.

I say I'll talk to my mom about it and he sends me [this paper](http://imgur.com/XLyC9uw)

Now, I'm not sure what to do. Is it worth getting my mom to do this, or what options do I have.

Also, I feel so tossed around on this by the company and I know that collectors try to fluff up charges a bit as well, so I don't even know if the amount their claiming is fully legit.

In the meantime, I've emailed him back and requested that he provide proof of the original account and promissory note, including the interest and fees portion, but so far no response.

This is extremely frustrated. I only make roughly $2,400 a month (which is enough to live on over here). I also get a housing stipend from the VA as part of my GI Bill. I'm going to grad school full time to get certified as a teacher - but all of my other student debt, from undergrad til now, is covered under federal loans and there are no issues there.

So yeah. I don't know if there's even a way to TL;DR this, its such a cluster. Please, oh PLEASE help me.",finance,1420697602

I need some advice","Hey, so my parents are kicking me out of the house when I graduate from high school (5-6 mo from now) and I was hoping you guys could help me figure out what I should do. I don't have any savings and am currently looking for a job for at least minimum wage, which is $9.00/hr in California. I'm willing to work at least 22 hours a week while in school. I don't have a car, but have access to transportation. I can provide any other information about my situation.

Also, I've just been accepted into a pretty good state college, but now my options seem limited. How should I be saving, or what should I do? I do have my own bank account set up.

Edit: Thank you guys for all the advice, it's really comforting to know that I have options and I appreciate the effort. To clear up some things

-I am being kicked out because my parent's are having financial issues and don't want the burden of having me around. They plan to move off somewhere else where it would be easier for them, and believe that as an adult, I should be able to take care of myself. I don't expect any further support from them in any way.

-I have in no way caused trouble for my family, my father has had a short temper since I was small, and my mother has been pretty much the same way since she had been diagnosed with diabetes a few years ago. The house has been tense and dwindling finances had added to it. I assume their fed up with the stress and just want to start over.

personalfinance,Where do we go from here? 30 year old home bodies.,"Longtime lurker here. I read this sub every day, but have never commented, but will after this.  
I want a reality check on where we are at and where we are going.  
29M, married to 29F.  
No kids, yet. 3 cats and a greyhound doggy.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Education and Income:**  
I am a CPA with a master’s degree, and am currently working as a systems analyst for a large company making 67K, moving to about 75K in the next 3-6 month; with further promotions likely.  
Wife also has her masters and works as a college instructor making about 36K.  
In 2015 we will make over 100K for the first time. It has varied between 50K-80k from 2010-2014. 100K is a lot of money as compared to our extended family, and more than our parents make at the end of their working careers currently.  
I will make about 3K this year from side income.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Housing:**  
Live a low cost Midwestern City.  We like it here.  
Owe 88K that we bought for 110K as a foreclosure.  
4% interest rate.  
Currently worth about 150K after I finish some outstanding projects.  
It has pretty much everything we wanted except for a 2 car garage and a backyard worth fencing in.  
Mortgage+tax+insurance are $714 a month.  
My sister lives with us and pays rent of $300, but that goes towards food too, so it is mostly a wash. She’s getting on her feet after college, and getting married in a year, so it is temporary.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Assets:**  
5K in business checking (side profits for 2014)  
3.5K in easy access checking/savings  
20K in emergency fund in online savings  
2.5K in various savings accounts/sinking funds) in online savings  
3K in mutual funds that I am about to sell at a slight gain  
18K in IRAs  
5K in HSA  
My work retirement is a match of 75% for up to 8% contribution (Only 1.5k so far)  
12K in Wife’s work retirements is 200% match for up to 5% contribution  
We take full advantage of both employer matches  
Everything in the house and driveway is paid for  
About 5K worth of tools (replacement value), most of which I bought used  

&amp;nbsp;

**Insurance:**  
Good auto/home insurance and deductibles.  
Each job has $0 contributions for health insurance.  
Good term 30 year term life on top of cheap employer life insurance.  
Disability insurance through work.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Debt:**  
College loans are paid off. Had $25,000 total between the two of us.  
18K worth of cars are owned outright: a 2007, 2007, and a 1992. I take care of them, and will drive each to over 200k miles.  
No other debt.  
Really no other obligations.  
Between credit cards and store credit cards, we have about 60K in unused credit capacity.  
Excellent credit scores and background checks.  
Held Secret Clearance until it lapsed after a job change.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Lifestyle:**  
We took a 4K vacation for our 5 year anniversary. Otherwise, we are home bodies.  
Always wait to buy things until we save up or reallocate funds from other savings.  
Recently bumped up the emergency fund from $15K to $20K. Plan to keep it there for the foreseeable future.  
No planned large purchases for the next 2 years.  
I can get 100% reimbursement for another master’s. It would be a lot of effort, but am seriously considering it.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Free Cash Flow:**  
I’ve projected our free cash flow after the following items to be about $21-25K for 2015.  
Housing  
Taxes  
Insurances  
Transportation  
Living expenses based on 3 years of consistent lifestyle  
Sinking fund savings (for predictable but infrequent expenses)  
HSA (another 3K this year)  
401k contribution to get the full match  
Tithe  

&amp;nbsp;

**Goals:**  
So, what are our goals? Some compete and some are complementary.  
1. Have a 2-3 kids and raise them right  
2. Pay off the house  
3. Move to our “perfect” house, that could cost anywhere from 180K to 250K  
4. Invest in the market (non-retirement)  
5. Retire well (fund IRA’s)  
6. Put it into a big pile in the online savings account, lol  
7. Take a kick ass vacation  
8. Live a consistent life (we take calculated risks, but are not “go big or go home” people.  

&amp;nbsp;

So, what do we do with that money?  
1. Put the money towards mortgage each month  
2. Put the money in the market, and then withdraw when it is enough to pay off the house in full  
3. Max contributions to IRA’s (which I have never done), and then put the rest towards the house  
4. Buy our perfect house and then rent out our current house as a long term investment strategy  
5. Put money in the market for the long term and let our wealth build wealth

When I was choosing colleges, my aunt, grandpa, and parents told me they would all support me financially so that I could go the better but more expensive university of my choice. **Tuition/housing/etc is around $32k/year** (originally $60k but I have financial aid that covers $28k/year). My financial aid is mostly the Pell Grant and a university grant. I also took out federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans but they are only $2-4k/year. 



My aunt got pregnant and is raising her baby alone so she is unable to support me anymore. My grandpa ended up having a lot of health issues (diagnosed with diabetes, physical therapy, several surgeries) and he doesn't agree with the school I chose so he is not helping me pay anymore. **My parents are paying for my college in $3-4k/month installments along with my brother's tuition $16k/year, $8k paid twice a year at the beginning of the semester.**



**My parents have drained their savings and taken out $80k in loans already.** I'm working part-time making minimum wage while in school. I feel guilty spending all of their savings and tried to transfer but I was rejected from the schools I applied to. I told my parents I wanted to take a leave of absence to work but they said I wouldn't make enough to even cover a semester tuition so I should just stay in school and they'll find a way to make more money. 



Should I take a leave of absence to work and then apply to transfer to a cheaper university again? And if I tried to transfer, would I look bad for my record since I would be out of school for 6 months (spring/summer semester)? How do I take out private loans? I feel so alone and I don't want to jeopardize my family financially. Sorry if this is too long, thanks for reading it all.

I always make sure my car has gas to get me to and from work, I do my best to pay my bills (rent, car, insurance, cellphone, cable, food) but often miss a payment to pay another, or from reckless spending. I've applied for a credit card multiple times and have been denied for having an old unpaid cellphone contract, which is currently being paid off and won't be an issue as of February.  
With my daughter entering the world, I've realized past mistakes may now bite me in the ass and prevent me from giving her the life she deserves. 
My current job blows and the only reason I'm still here is because it pays 11/hr. Which is better than most jobs around here. The building we guard (yup I'm a rent-a-cop) manufactures parts and is the best job someone in this area can land. I would love to get into the plant and start moving my life in the right direction, but we have to wait a year to apply for some weird reason, and I can't wait a year to possibly get a better job.  
I'd love to write and self publish a few stories, it's something I've recently fell in love with, or get an idea for a product I have sold in stores. Everyone around me tells me shit like ""yea good luck"" ""have fun with that"" or to put it bluntly ""that's fuckin stupid"" so I'm already a few steps back from believing them and thinking I'm stuck with this mediocre life style. 
On top of barely having money to pay my bills and keep my daughter fed (I should mention the GF is in the picture also do all she can do) I don't really have the financial stability to drop everything and work on writing or getting my product sold. 
I'm scared I'm stuck at this slightly over minimum wage paying job and with a newborn daughter, that reality is crushing me...
Any advice?

Edit: well offering to get a second job ended with me being single. When I get a second I'll catch everyone up. Thanks for the help and advice, I just may have had some expenses cut.

personalfinance,Credit consolidation 42k debt,"I'm 42k in debt (not counting 7k I have in student loans) this includes my credit cards (some with really high interest rates) and my car loan (with a crazy low interest rate). The car loan is only about $3500 of that debt.

My monthly payments are strangling me. I pay so much in interest that I only make the minimum payments and then have to use my cards to survive. 

I want to consolidate my debt, but I don't know what agency to go with. I'm afraid of getting hooked into something even worse. 

I always make the minimum payments on time, I can't afford to pay one card extra until it's paid off (it's been suggested to me before).

I make about 3k a month after taxes, but I don't get paid over the summer as I'm a teacher. I drive for Lyft then and hope I'll get picked to teach summer school, but you never know. I save during the year for rent and bills, but there's no money coming in those two months guaranteed.

I have some huge expenses coming up, too. My car needs transmission work, and I can't eat without being in pain because my back teeth are so badly in need of work.

I'm in a real pickle, and I'd appreciate some advice.

Edited to add: I'm not a crazy spender or anything. I don't have nice clothes and I live in a tiny apartment where I pay $800 rent. I always make my minimum payments on time, but my credit union has already denied me a consolidation loan. I live in Oakland, CA. 

I also had about $200.00 pick pocketed (sp?) from me recently. I know that sounds like nothing, but it was pretty devastating for me. 
I can't drive for Lyft because the car needs work, but that was my part time job until recently. I can't get a job part time with a more steady schedule (like working in a shop) because I need to be there for my family, and my demands at school are already pretty taxing.",finance,1420724745
personalfinance,Student loan consolidation questions.,"So I have about $30,000 in private loans through Navient at about a 9% interest rate and about $20,000 in federal Stafford loans through Nelnet ranging from a 3.5% to 5% interest rate.

financialindependence,SO and I (both 26) have been working towards FI for 4.5 years now. Thoughts on using some of our savings and supplemental income for jumpstarting an income property portfolio vs. paying off student loan debt?,"Hello All!


I recently discovered /r/financialindependence through /r/personalfinance and I think my questions and overall goals fit better here.


My girlfriend (soon to be fiance hopefully) and I hope to achieve  financial independence before we’re 50.  One of the great things that has helped us so far is me being a graduate student for the past 4.5 years my income has been lower and less secure than my peers, which initially put me in a savings-focused mindset once I graduated college.  She also did not have a very high-paying job starting out from college, so we’ve both become accustomed to a pretty low-cost lifestyle.  When we get extra cash from promotions / sideline business / etc, it’s just extra cash for saving / investing.  Here’s a quick summary of what we’ve been able to save so far in the past 4.5 years:


We keep separate accounts, but here’s the combined totals:


Cash Savings:  $33,000

Roth IRA:  $34,000

401(k):  $11,000

Cash in Checking:  $5000  (not really savings, but included as cash-on-hand)

**Total:  $83,000**


We’re both 26.  I make about $27,000 after taxes (graduate fellowship) and she makes about $29,000 after taxes.  Since I’m paid by a fellowship and I expect to make more in retirement than I do now, and I want the extra flexibility of being able to withdraw my contributions, I choose to make my entire $5500/year contribution to a Roth IRA.  Since she works for a company she gets 401(k) matching that she maxes out.


We also have combined about $72,000 in student loan debt from undergrad that has hindered our ability to save as much as we could.  We have been on income-based repayment so it’s $500/month.  I’ll talk about this in more detail when I get to my question.


One of the reasons we have been able to save up so much on our salaries is because I have had 3 engineering internships while in grad school.  This supplemented my fellowship income.  Each internship is only 12-15 weeks, but pays $30-$35 an hour, so I walk away with about $10,000 from each one after taxes and expenses associated with relocating for the internship.  I’m also very fortunate to have an SO who is very supportive of me being absent for several months to make money on the side like this.  I also earn some sideline income helping people with writing resumes / cover letters / other professional documents.  We also rent out the spare bedroom in our townhome for some extra income.


We use a shared google docs spreadsheet to track every income / expense.  A typical month of income / expenses is:

**Income After Taxes**


My Fellowship:  $2250

Her Job:  $2400

Rental Income:  $400

Internships / Sidelines:  $900  (average per month, often realized over 3-4 months)

**Total Monthly Income After Taxes:  $5950**


**Expenses**

Mortgage:  $900

Utilities:  $150

Transportation:  $250

Cell Phones:  $135

Groceries &amp; Household:  $360

Entertainment:  $300

Student Loans:  $500

Miscellaneous:  $200  (one-off stuff like ordering transcripts or something)

**Total Monthly Expenses:  $2795**






Anyways, in addition to just saving and investing, we’re hoping to build a portfolio of income properties.  We plan to slowly purchase condos / small homes in American college towns where the economy has stable growth and there's usually a high demand for rental housing.



While we're working, the rent payments will go towards paying off the property, maintenance, etc., and slowly build equity for us.  One of the things we're counting on is being able to raise rent about 3-4% per year; since the mortgage payment will remain the same this will allow us to pay off the properties well before the end of the mortgage.  Unless we have A LOT of extra cash sitting around we don't intend to put much of our own cash into the properties, unless the interest rate is significantly higher than what we can get now; instead we'll just let the tenant's cash go towards paying the mortgage on the property, while we use our own cash to invest.  While this does mean we'll get less cash out of the property from rent, It will keep us more liquid and able to invest in other things that come along.


Another side note is that as the properties get paid off we can use one or two of them as our “cash cows” that we can mortgage to get cash for other investments if the interest rate is reasonable enough.



Anyways....we kicked off our plan last year with the purchase of our current townhome (2BD/2.5B 1200SF) in a growing college town where I am currently finishing out my PhD in electrical engineering and she works full time.  We currently live in our townhome and rent out the second room.  The plan is to keep this property and rent it out when I graduate and we move.


I'm slowly getting to my question, just hang in there!



In addition to my fellowship and internships, I recently got some additional contract work that will net me about $50,000 after taxes over the next 18 months.  We have been considering using about $20k-$30k of this to make down payments on a couple other properties around town before we leave since we feel this is a really stable growth area.  Since these would not be primary residences, the lender would probably want to see 20% down on each, so we could either go for one $100k unit or maybe 2 x $75k-$80k units.


However, we also have that $72,000 student loan debt from undergrad.  This is spread over about 15 loans with principle amounts from $1000 - $12,000 or so.  Interest is around 4-5% on all loans.


**So, what we are trying to decide right now is should we use this extra $50,000 of income to jump start our rental property portfolio, or take a huge chunk out of the student debt?**  If we put all the $50k into the debt we could wipe out the rest using cash from our savings and be debt-free except for the mortgage on our townhome.  Wiping out that debt puts at least $500/month back in our pockets to save….it’s really a question of balancing higher total return in the long run versus short-term liquidity, but I think there are also considerations of what kind of interest rate I can get on mortgage loans now vs. several years from now, and if the growth in equity and rental income from the property will outweigh interest paid to the student loans over the long term….


Another thing to consider is we may not be able to get another mortgage loan until we pay off the student loan debt as we would be too highly leveraged…..


Anyways, if anyone has experience in this area some guidance would be much appreciated!


Thanks!!",finance,1420733261
personalfinance,Want to buy a house in 3-4 years. Am I on the right track?,"Hey PF! My husband and I want to buy a house in about 3-4 years. We're working on paying off my student loans and a few other debts.  


Here's our budget:  

  
**Income:**  

**Me: $3,000/month.** Paid biweekly. $38,000 per year post taxes, health insurance, 401k, 10% automatically put into savings, etc.  

**Husband: $2,000/month.** $26,000 a year post taxes. Paid weekly, so there's a few months where that becomes $2,500. Also usually gets ~$100/week in overtime, but since that's unpredictable, I don't budget it.  



  
  
**Savings:**  

**$1,200.** This was kinda wiped out when my husband lost his job earlier this year, and we're working to rebuild it. I have 10% of my paycheck auto-deposited in the account.  

  

  
**Debts:**  

**Credit Card: $3,000 @ 16%** I had to have some surgery this year that wasn't covered by insurance, and this was at the same time husband lost his job. I am pausing extra payments on student loans (see below) until this is paid in full.  

**Motorcycle: $224/month.** 9 months left. 18% interest, but we have to pay the full amount of interest whether we pay it off early, so I have no real motivation to try to pay the balance off right now when we have the CC with high interest as well. The motorcycle is my husband's primary transportation. This will be paid off Sept 2015 in full.  

**Student Loans: $1,880/month** This is $1,100 higher than my minimum payment. I have $55,800 of loans through Navient, and $5,300 through SLFC. Interest rates range from 2.080% to 6.55%. I am putting the extra payment towards the 6.55% loans since they are the highest interest and largest amount (almost $40,000 is 6.55%). Any time we have an extra paycheck month, or get overtime, or get a work bonus, we put an extra payment towards these loans. I plan to have them paid off in full by November 2016.  

  


  
**Monthly Bills:**   

**Rent: $1,050**  

**Power: $100**  

**Gas: $50**  

**Phone: $180**  

**Truck Insurance: $111**  

**Bike Insurance: $86**  

**Renters Insurance: $42**  

**Netflix: $10**  

**Internet: $50**  

**Groceries: $600**  

**Home/Vehicle repairs: $150**  

**Gasoline: $350**  

**Gym: $15**  



Once student loans are paid in full, the $1,800+ that was going towards that will be put straight into savings. By the end of 2018 we should have over $80,000 saved, barring unforeseen circumstances.

Are we on the right track as far as budgeting and spending goes? Is there anything we should be aware of when planning to buy? Are there any glaring inconsistencies or common pitfalls I'm not seeing?

personalfinance,Terribly Screwed Up And No Idea Where to Start,"Hi, the title pretty much explains it all. I know I'm really in debt and I have no idea how to fix it. My credit score is in the mid 400's. I have federal student loans amounting to about $30,000 which are in default I believe. I have a car loan at about $10,000. I recently payed off my only (I think) CC bill that was at $1,200. I kept on getting notices and couldn't stand it anymore and just paid it off in full. I'm pretty sure I have other debts like an old credit card and maybe medical payments but I have no idea where to see if I do or how much they are. I have no idea where to start on getting information on any of my loans or other debt and how to pay them off.

Part of the reason I'm doing so bad is because I was dead broke for 2 years. Barely able to pay rent and feed myself. This left me with some pretty good spending habits.. I hardly ever buy things that I don't need and I try very hard to not eat or drink out. But now that I do have a bit of income I am getting into my hobby's which is mostly outdoor activities. Alot of the gear is a one time cost that I can use over and over again, and some of the cost is in renting a kayak or a campsite or getting a hiking permit. But I know the costs really do add up. Should I stop on my hobby until I'm cleared? 

Anyways, now I have a job that pays me about $2,200 a month, and pretty much no bills with about $1,800 in my checking account and $200 in savings. Insurance (health &amp; car) and phone are covered by work and I moved back home. I NEED the car for work and for where I live so as much as I'd love to get rid of it, I can't. I drive a Prius so at least my gas is like $35 a month. I also pay for a gym membership at $30 a month as well. And I share the grocery shopping with my family since we are all adults now.

I'm trying to choose between 30 and 15 year mortgages.  ~~It's my understanding that a 30-year will have a better interest rate.~~  So my question is: if I got with a 30-year and pay it off in 15 years, am I saving money or will I still end up paying the interest owed or something like that.

I ask because the home includes a rental property so if I'm able to rent it out then making close to double payments will be easy, but it won't always be occupied so there's that.

personalfinance,"I am a 22 year old in a really desperate financial situation, and I need advice on what to do.","Hi /r/personalfinance. I've never posted here before, but I don't know who else to ask. My situation feels pretty hopeless.

So I signed up to take college courses over the summer through ""consortium"" (which means that I get financial aid through my home school, then receive a refund which I pay to the schools where I'm taking the classes). I participated in the classes for a week and a half before the stress of an abusive personal situation made me completely lose interest and all but forget about the classes.

I was getting paid very little, less than minimum wage, at the job I had at the time. I had just moved into a new apartment, and ended up using the financial aid money to avoid eviction. I know I misused it, and I know it was stupid in hindsight, but at the time it made sense. 

The loans were over $4,000. I assumed that the schools where I was taking the classes would simply drop me from them after I didn't pay. This was not the case. Now, one of the schools has a bill of $1,700 that they are planning to send to collections if I don't start making payments. 

My plan was to start school again this spring, and I was going to take out extra money in my student loan to cover that debt, hereafter referred to as ""debt 1"". It was shitty and a waste of money, but I was looking forward to learning my lesson and moving on.

When I tried to re-enroll at school, though, I had a hold on my account in the financial aid department because of ""missing transcripts"". I THOUGHT that if I call and said I ended up not taking the class, they would just say ""ok!"" and take the hold off. I was wrong. 

They are now demanding that I pay back the FULL financial aid costs from that summer, amounting to over $4,000. They said I have 30 days. I then sent them a copy of my transcript (on which I received failures) but now the counselor is telling me that because I SAID that I didn't attend the class, I no longer have a right to the money in the federal government's eyes. 

I told her that I paid the school already (even though I'm in the process of paying debt #1).  
I then told her that I actually attended the first week and a half of the classes, which I did. She says it doesn't matter because I already said that I didn't attend, and that I have 30 days to pay back the money. 

I do not have this money. Neither do my parents. They don't have enough in all of their accounts combined to pay this. I am already down to $2 in my account and can barely afford rent and food. 

What should I do? I know I messed up BADLY. I just want to fix it. I feel like I'm ruining my parent's life. Do I have any options? How do I handle this?

investing,2015: Oil Prices and the Effects,"I have never studied economics before, however I would like to describe my Oil-Price Economics Thesis and I would like some critical response on my rationality and correct my thought process.

Assumption: Oil prices remain low at sub $60 / barrel for 2015.

Effect:

* Oil consumers will greatly benefit with a lot of cost savings. Some examples include: an average family may save up to $1000 USD / year in gasoline/heating savings, airlines will make a lot more money (cheaper fuel, more vacations sold), and even basic consumer products/retailers will benefit (e.g., lower delivery/shipping costs).
* Oil producers will make less money. This includes governments (e.g., Russia / Alberta) and OilCorps and their employees. There will be layoffs in the oil patch.

The basis of my thesis is this: there will be a lot of extra $$ in the average consumer pocket, this money was previously allocated to oil is now available for spending. [see: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-07/oil-at-40-means-boon-for-some-no-ice-cream-for-others.html]. This extra $$ in consumer can be used for:

* [1] spending (growing GDP), or
* [2] saving (or reducing debt levels).

The inflation index will go down (e.g., oil is a huge component of the index), however, if consumers spend more, does it really matter? e.g., the inflation index might go down, but the average absolute dollars spent per consumer will actually be flat (e.g., shifted from oil to other consumer goods). We should actually not expect the FED to decrease interest rates, but rather increase interest rates. With the extra $$ per consumer, we can now increase the interest rates to soak up some of the $$ previously spent on oil to spend on servicing debt and mop up some of the cash in the market. Short term interest rates should rise, however I am not sure the effect of the long term interest rates.

Banks / Insurance Companies will benefit a lot (e.g., WFC). They hold a lot of mortgages, especially for WFC, their funding sources are mostly from savings and their cost will remain low. However, if interest rates rise they will make more $$. Banks / Insurance companies with such a profile will become a BUY.


Any criticism on this thesis would be awesome : )",finance,1420755303
personalfinance,Is there any way to find how much I paid in state taxes 10 years ago without a W-2 or return?,"I recently moved back to Oklahoma and am trying to reinstate my nursing license which lapsed while I held license out of state.

I don't have records from ten years ago, my accountant doesn't have records from that far back, and the two places I worked have destroyed the records from anything past 7 years. 

The IRS only has record of what I payed in federal tax, not state. The State of Oklahoma apparently keeps no record of how much a person pays in at all. They have to have a W-2 showing what I have paid. 

I seem to have no options since neither I, my accountant, or my employer has these records.

personalfinance,About to get a mortgage but wanting to save for a emergency fund (AU),"Hi all,

I'm curious as to what you all think of this...

I'm about to get a home loan to buy a place of my own.  So for a while now, all my money has been going into a savings account for that purpose.  However, I haven't really been budgeting very well (only just started).  Although I've saved up successfully for the home loan, after I get it I'll only have a few thousand left over--certainly not enough to cover for 6 months of expenses etc.

I'm happy to start a separate savings account for just such a purpose.  It'll be one of those savings accounts that limit transactions and requires at least $200 saved every month, and rewards you with a higher interest rate for saving.

But I'm wondering if that's realistic when soon I'll be paying off a mortgage.  Would I be better off sending that extra money to my mortgage?  Basically splitting the money between my normal savings account and my mortgage.

I'm just concerned that if I send it to my normal savings account, it might eventually vanish into the black hole of expenses that pop up :p  you know what I mean.

However if I split what I have left after the required fortnightly mortgage payment into three, my mortgage would suffer as a result, even if it's only for 3-4 years.

Does that make sense?  What do you think?",finance,1420758671
investing,Is my grandmother being taken advantage of by her financial advisor?,"My grandmother has invested around $700,000 with a financial advisor. He purchased 3 different funds, each of which has a 5.75% front end load and around 1.15% annual expense ratio. This is a red flag and I've already lectured her on why this is a bad sign. Don't even get me started on this... 
This is a taxable account.

What I am curious about is why there is a $42,000 margin loan sitting in cash in her account. I can upload a picture of her statement if this would help. It doesn't appear that the margin is invested in anything, just sitting in cash--which she pays an interest rate on. Why would a financial advisor do this? 

My grandmother withdraws $11,000 every two months to pay her living expenses. She has no other taxable income and has about $60,000 in annual expenses related to medical care that are tax deductible. 

Does anyone have any insight as to what is going on here? Is the margin account being used to pay her expenses?

investing,My investment plan for the future.,"Well what a year.  I'm really glad I I put 15k into kmp/kmi earlier in the year.  That turned out well.  I missed with UBNT.  In total my highrisk plays washed out.  I had like 2500 gains and losses.  I did not consider KMI a high risk move say all in all up quite a bit.  I washed on AIG today because I decided to move out of it and fund the Roth.  

My picks in the Roth beat the midcap index though considering they were pretty low beta I think I did well.  Still probably done picking for the most part.  I'm going to devote like ~5% to a gambling fund for my picks.

Loaded up the Roth today.  PSEC and ARCC.  Really wish ARCC wouldn't have been upgraded before the first of the year.  Probably will hold an REIT in the wifes.  Updated my 401k.  60/40 s&amp;p 500 and 40 bond (yes fucking vanguard).  I'm pretty heavy small/mid caps right now.  I'm just going to leave those be. 

I'm going to keep everything contribution wise in the 401k 60/40 split.  Going to rebalance twice a year.  The Roth's will be loaded up annually with REIT and BCDs for a little bit of diversification.

I do not hold foreign stocks.  I do not like foreign stocks.  I feel the USA s&amp;p500 gives enough expose to the world and I want to keep my money at home as much as possible.  The USA is the greatest country in the world in my opinion.  Why would I want to buy BABA or whatever crap China is selling.  I might gamble on it short term but yeah that is just how I feel.

Should have the house paid off probably by June.  If I liquidated one Roth and the taxable I could cover it now with my cash reserves.  I don't expect much to happen in the 6 months though. 

I'm 60/40 KMI/munibonds right now so I'm not to worried.  KMI is really going to have to take a shit before I'll lose money on it.  Same with the munibonds.

Liquidating the taxable probably in May so I can claim long term cap gains on KMI.

I'm think going to start maxing out the 401k middle of the year.  Might max the wife's as well but I think we will use that money to blow on things.  You can't take it with you, know?

Decided I'll probably keep my rental another couple years and go from there.  It like to at least break even on it.  We lived there for a while but thanks to the housing crush I'm still underwater on it (investment wise).  I think I'm going to see how stuff looks in 4 years.  If housing stays flat I'll break even at sale and have no cap gains/loses.  Overall it would have beat renting during that time frame, but barely, and I am making the best of a bad situation right now.  I did move into my new place for an excellent price so there is that also and I didn't destroy my credit.  Doing about 10% roi on the rental (after factoring replacement costs) so I still might hold.  When I finally sell it will determine my loss/gain.  

I think interest rates will stay low.  I think the dow will be around 19k next year.  My 17500 prediction was pretty spot on (see my history).

I've given up on stocks for the part on trying to pick them.  I'm going to go more marco in my approach and go after sectors on my gambling picks.  I think BCD's are way under priced.  I have no problem loading up on those this year.  Home loan is my highest debt loan at 3.8%.  I have assorted other loans below that so as long as I beat a little over 4% I'll be money ahead.  I decided on the house not to mess around with picking up pennies in front of the steam roller.  The other loans are student loans so whatever, I'll just defer them if I'm forced to do so but that would be one hell of a financial setback if that happened.

I'm in my early 30's and looking forward to an early retirement.  Feels good.  Not sure I'd do it again though.  I sat on my ass for many years doing nothing and just paying bills/saving money.",finance,1420759161

Hoping this may lead to some discussion/insight on what fellow investors are forecasting for some sectors this year.

2014:
Utilities led the way with a ~24% gain. Mostly due to the dividends that util companies offer since investors couldn't get much from the very low bond yields.

HEALTH CARE: ~23%. Biotechs had a phenomenal year. Health care was also, i believ,e the only sector to handle the early 2015 volatility (this past week) quite well. Can it carry through 2015?

TECH: ~18%. Tends to do well during expansionary periods. However, some of the top guys didnt have their best performances (i.e IBM).

FINANCIALS: ~13%. Solid Gains in 2014. Will rising interest rates benefit the sector (if they actually happen)?

STAPLES: ~13%

CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY: ~8%. Down a bit from 2013. Will lower pump prices lead to more spending?

INDUSTRIALS: Ended 2014 with ~7.5% gain. The oil drop towards the end of 2014 certainly was a boost to airlines. Will this sector improve IF (big if?) oil stays low.

MATERIALS: ~4.5%. Commods/mining dragged this sector.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: ~ -2%. Poor 2014. May be a good bet for those who expect an economic contraction.

ENERGY: ~ -10%. The one everybody is talking about. The tanking of crude oil really destroyed this sector. Rebound?",finance,1420768769

personalfinance,1099-Misc Contractor...should I go back to school?,"Once upon a time I was an irresponsible teenager perusing a ""useless"" (read: art) degree at a state university. I had some issues with my classes being cut from the program, preventing me from graduating. So instead of fighting it or getting something similar, I dropped out (like a dumbass.) 

I was lucky. I only had a 6k federal student loan. Last year, I got a job as a software tester making $13 an hour (independent contractor) so I worked on knocking this out. 

I was also very dumb with my credit card. I had a 2k balance that I also paid off over a year ago when I got my job. My spouse and I ate beans/rice for awhile and cut back on a lot of things. 


The current job that I have is not likely to hire me on as a W-2 employee any time in the near future. I work pretty much a set amount of hours like a full time employee, except I'm not one. I have been here for over a year and a half. I have periods of being in between projects where I do not work, but this has not occurred in a year. I realize that the place that I work for should not be doing this and that I am paying my own taxes (more on this below.) Which brings me to my next point.

I know that working this job is not sustainable forever. If I (again) weren't lucky enough to have my spouse, I'd be struggling a lot more.

I've been wanting to go back to school, but without having to take out student loans. If this means that I would have to work while going to school, I could probably wing it. However, if I'm doing school full time, I would ideally want that to be my primary focus. 

I want to go back to school for software development or ASL. I realize the smarter thing to do would be to pursue software development as I already have experience in the field. Now that I'm older and hopefully a little wiser than my teenage self, I'd like to make the degree worth my time. 

I have attempted to find a more ""sustainable"" job in software development/testing but I have not been successful. 

I would want to do ASL as I do also have experience in this as well and could likely land a job after graduating. The college that I am interested in however, is out of state. This would require me to move. While the college tuition there is technically more expensive than the one that would offer the software dev degree, we would be closer to family and the cost of living is more than half than what it is here. My spouse could potentially work remotely with the same position he has and keep the same benefits, but that would be something he would need to run  by his boss. His field is pretty in demand right now (Java dev) so he would not have an issue finding another job if needed. He supports me fully in the decision that I choose to make. I just want to make the right one for us, and for our future. 




**Monthly income:** 

Spouse:  3k after taxes, health insurance, HSA, etc. detailed below

Me: 2k. I put 25% in savings each time I am paid. Other than needing to take a few emergency days off this year, I've been working full time since April and my boss doesn't expect that he'll have to let me go any time soon. 

I also got a raise just this week, so from here on out, my pay will be 2200 pre-tax.

I am paid weekly while my spouse is paid by-weekly.

Monthly expenses:

* Rent: $700
* Utilities: $120 (electric, water, sewer)
* Internet: $40
* Car loan @ 2.75%: $305 (12,458 left)
* Gas: $120
* Tithe:$625
* Student loan (spouse) @ : $80 $6500 left
* Food/Groceries: $300-$400 (trying to knock this down)
* Toiletries, house stuff, cleaning items: $75
* Spouse's medicine: $30/month
* Car insurance: $70 a month (we pay the premium every six months, but set this aside every month)
* Renters insurance: $10 (already paid for the year)
* Cell phone: $35
* Health insurance, Dental, HSA contribution, Vision: $485
*Date nights: $50

We have no credit cards as we found that they resulted in poor impulse control. I did have a student loan earlier this year from college but we worked to pay that off completely (yay!) We have no children and don't plan to for awhile. 

**The tuition as follows:**
ASL degree: 20k/year
Software dev degree 12k/year

We currently have 5k in our savings right now. 1k of that is our ""emergency"" fund while the rest is what I've been putting away each time I get paid. I'm not sure how much we'll owe this year in taxes. My spouse claims 2 on his exemptions. 

Depending on how the transfer of credits go, I am looking at 2-2.5 years of school left with 15 hours a semester. At my last school, I was done with all general education requirements. 

I've applied to both schools and have filled out a FAFSA. I doubt I qualify for any need based grants or scholarships. Both would likely require student loans or us saving up. We really don't want to add more student loans, especially since I just paid mine off this past year. It was a huge relief to have it off our back. My spouse said if push comes to shove, we could take what we need, but not all that I qualify for. I don't want it to come down to this.

We also need to work on funding retirement. We are very behind, but right now our goal is to pay off our debts (the student and car loans.) 

I should also add, I don't really hate my job but I feel a little unmotivated and unchallenged. I don't particularity like the corporate b.s. but it's bearable. I've found that I love testing and learning new coding things. My boss's hands are tied and he can't hire me on full time as it's the CEO's decision. 

So my question is should we be saving for retirement (with me working as much as I can where I'm at/attempting to advance) or should I take the chance to go back to school while I'm still fairly young?

I'm trying to find my priorities, so any help/advice is really appreciated.",finance,1420773594

finance,Yield Curve Carry Trade Question,"Would now be a good time to long the 10 year and short the 1 year UST bonds?

http://imgur.com/qG5V4uA

There's an inverse relation between the 10-1 year spread and the US federal funds rate. This is because the federal funds rate disproportionately affects the close end of the yield curve.

The fundamentals of the trade look solid. Markets are anticipating rate hikes to 1%+ by the end of the year. Low oil prices + rate hikes should keep inflation relatively low. 

The best part about the trade is the carry + roll generated. The 1 year is trading at 0.25% and the 10 year at 2.03%, meaning that you'll generate ~178 bps per year even if nothing happens. 

The worst case scenario is if oil rises pushing inflation up and the fed delays rate hikes while the economy continues to stablize. If you were more risk averse about long term inflation you could long the 5y instead of the 10y.

personalfinance,How to determine whether to reduce taxable income or just bite the bullet and pay a potentially big tax bill?,"**Relevant Background:**

Long story short…. Married with one child. We signed up for health insurance last year via the federal exchange. At that point, we qualified for about a $300/month subsidy – which we applied monthly. Over the span of 2014, both my wife and I worked more (no big raises, just picking up extra hours here and there) and subsequently made a good deal more money in 2014 over 2013. And this is where the problem lies. I downloaded the draft tax forms for 2014 in order to estimate our taxes…It turns out we moved up to 360% of the federal poverty line and we will now owe back nearly all of that $300/month subsidy we got all year long. The subsidy repayment is capped at $2500. I think we will owe the max.

**Question:**

At what point is it not wise to sink a lot of money (say $8,000-$9,000) in IRAs and an HSAs (yes being careful not to exceed limits) in order to avoid losing say $1,500 to the IRS (there is no way for us to possibly reduce our income enough to make the entire $2,500 go away)? I suppose I am just looking for advice on whether it is a good idea to simply lose approximately $1,000-$1500 to the IRS or to tie up a MUCH greater sum of money in IRAs and HSAs, but actually keep it in the end. It would be somewhat tough, but we can save that amount of money between now and April 15 – we only maxed out one of our traditional IRAs last year and only contributed about $1,500 to our HSA. *Note:* In order to do this, it would greatly limit out regular savings for e-fund and such.

1. pay $475 a month for 2 years and return the car and use my parent's suv though it has not good gas. &lt;- I am basically throwing away $11000 (475x24) 

2. Keep paying $470 a month for 1 year. Refinance after 1 year through credit union. Change from lease to buying the car for $17500 (residual value after 1 year) with maybe 2% interest rate for 60 months. Ride this corolla for next 15 years till it dies.

3. Keep paying $470 a month for 2 years and buy the car for $15800 through toyota financing or credit union (residual value after 2 years).

personalfinance,First Full-time Employment and I'm looking to get my plan looked over by more experience PFers...,"After about 6 months of trying, I finally landed a full-time job, and a pretty sweet one at that. Mechanical Engineer (MS) by trade, and will be able to get some international work in over 18 months in a development. Awesome experience, but besides the point.

Let me outline my situation, including work package, debts, credit, auto situation, and then go into my budget as I have it currently planned out, and see what you guys have to say. I would REALLY appreciate any and all advice and constructive criticism to get me ready to go and make sure nothing has fallen through the cracks on this.

To clear some things up regarding my situation, I got into a rotational development program. The first four months I'll be working at my 'home' group. After that, I'll be required to do two more rotations, one of which must be international (likely in Germany), and there's the option that the other could also be international. But at this point it is too early to say when I will for sure be in what locations. This plays into the auto situation.

**Work Package**

* $65k USD annual salary
* Full Aetna healthcare through my mom at Costco (I'm 24 and can keep it until I turn 26; better than provided options)
* 401k match, 3% minimum, up to 8%
  *Caveat - If I leave the company with 5+ years of service, I get all of the company contribution. If I leave earlier (which is highly likely) I receive the following: one year (20%), two years (40%), three years (60%), four years (80%)*
* Basic Life Insurance (covered)
* Short-term and Long-term Disability
* 4 Weeks Vacation

---|---
401k | $434
Emergency Fund | $200
Roth IRA (?) | $200
Travel and Fun Fund | $200
**Totals** | **$1034**

&amp;nbsp;

**Auto Situation**

At the moment, I do not have a car. I have a bike, which is good enough to get me around. But my job is about 20 miles from where I live. Although I have adequate gear to ride and stay 'comfortable' in rain and shitty weather, I know there will be days that either a) I don't want to be cold and wet or b) I need to look nice for work or customer meetings. Also, I live in Portland, so it'll be rainy fairly often. That said, I'm looking at getting a car somehow.

I've asked friends and family if they know anyone with an old car laying around I could borrow for a few months (the time I'll be in town before I start my rotations, which could take me overseas), and nobody knows anything. 

(1)  I'm looking at a stick-shift Subaru Forester in the area at around $9k. I talked with USAA today and was approved for a 60-month Auto Loan for $10k at $215/month with 8.25% APR. If I decide to go this route, I am approved. This would add the **$215**/month to my debts.

(2)  The option of renting a car came up for this time period. Looking at a couple sources, it seems that $2200 would be the rough amount for a four month rental, coming to **$550**/month. This could save money in the long run, but would produce a much higher immediate cost.

&amp;nbsp;

**Everything Else**

* Housing - I'm planning on continuing to live at home for the next four months to save money. After that I'll be moving to different places for rotations
* Phone - **$65**/month, full data and all that jazz, as a part of a family plan
* Food - guessing **$200-300**/month for groceries, spare eating out, and some stuff to bars and whatnot to finally have a social life again (that is something I value enough to include in a budget)
* Gas - **$100**/month is an estimate, obviously dependent upon if I get and use a car on a regular basis


&amp;nbsp; 

**Gameplan / Budget / TL;DRish**

Putting down a Single-1 on my W4, I used [this pay calculator](http://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/payroll-calculators/salary-paycheck-calculator.aspx) to get an estimate of my take-home pay based on salary and tax info. With this, it estimated a net take-home pay of **$3724** per month (that does not include 401k contributions).

Summing up my projected expenses, budgeted expenses, assuming I buy the car, and an extra $200 for various items, this comes to **$2625** in expenses per month. With the extra money, my plan would be to start avalanching my higher-interest loans to expedite the repayment process.

&amp;nbsp;   

**Questions**

* **Overall** How did I do? Are there things I am blatantly missing? Am I considering certain items completely wrong?
* **401k** Should I contribute the full 8% to the 401k Match despite the potential drawbacks of leaving the company before 5 years, or find an optimum contribution? Possibly put the difference between max contribution and actual contribution towards student loans or starting a Roth IRA?
* **Auto** In your opinion, would it be worth it to buy a used car right now, pay the monthly payment for 5 years along with all of my other debts, or do whatever I can to get by without one for the next few months?
* **Advice** Do you have any words of advice for a young guy starting out with his financial future that you would've have liked imparted upon you at your start? Anything you would've liked to know or be aware of when you started out?",finance,1420788814

personalfinance,Question about student loan repayment for parents,"Quick backstory: While I am a US citizen, I was born and raised abroad. I didn't move to the US until I went to college back in 1999. Since I did not have residency anywhere, I could not get student loans. I went to a state school with some scholarships and was able to get my degree without debt thanks to my parents, an RA gig, and other jobs. But that's beside the point.

My wife and her 3 siblings all took out student loans. Her parents are going through some tough times right now, and claim that *they* are paying something like $800/mo towards their kids' student loans. This kind of puzzled me, as I thought that student loans were given to the students, and not the parents (i.e. my wife still owes some $10K on her undergrad loans). Her parents are asking for help, and given that my wife's siblings are not in a position to help (two are broke, one is unwilling), it's mostly falling on our laps.

I guess my question is: is it customary/required for parents to also take out student loans? I love my in-laws, they're very nice people, but I want to completely understand the situation while forming an actual plan to help them out. This upsets my wife tremendously, but I told her I don't want to send them money if they're in a position where it makes sense for them to declare bankruptcy, as that's akin to using buckets of water to put out a forest fire. Their house is falling apart, and I know they took a line of credit on it back in the day. I have no idea how much they still owe on it.

Also, I think they consolidated all the student loans, so federal hardship programs are not likely an option.

personalfinance,Need advice. Should I buy a different (cheaper) car to lower my current car payment?,"I'm trying to figure out if I should just keep my current car or get a cheaper, used car. We've recently had a change in our financial situation (went back to school full time) and would like to reduce our monthly payments. I have about 10K that I could use towards cars.

I'm currently driving a 2011 Mercedes C300. Bluebook value of about $17,400. I owe $19,560 at a 5.1% interest rate. My payment is $508.00 per month. I bought it from CarMax and have another 3 years of the CarMax extended warranty remaining. 

I'm looking at a 2012 Hyundai Sonata which would be $15,000. Looking at a 48 month loan which comes out to $329 (with a 3.74% interest rate) per month. I'm not sure if I'd purchase the warranty again this time but if I did, it'd run it up to about $372 per month. 

So what are your thoughts? Is buying the used car a smart decision or should I just keep what I currently have and suck up the high payments? Should I refinance my current car (not crazy about taking longer to pay it off)? Any other ideas out there? 

EDIT 1: I hadn't disclosed my financial situation for privacy reasons but here's some additional info. Let's see if that changes things. Our monthly income is fairly stable around 6K per month. Our expenses our WELL under this.  I'm just trying to be really frugal in these leaner times. The 10K is what we have just for the car. When we were gainfully employed, we managed to set aside 18 months of living expenses, max out 401Ks and IRAs and pay for college for our 2 kids (ages 12 and 9). I haven't really considered pulling some money out of those 18 months of expenses because that's my emergency fund and I don't consider this an emergency. 

How does this change things? Your input has been awesome so far! Thanks!",finance,1420811000

Salary - $46,000 (wife is still in school, but graduates in May)

Student Loans - $35,606

Vehicle Loan - $24,236

Credit Cards - $4,272

""Emergency Fund"" - $300 (working on that)

Checking - $2,000

We have pre-qualified for a loan with a 4% interest rate. My wife called about that and talked to the lender, so I'm not 100% on the details past the interest rate. I'll obviously talk to the lender more about that before going forward. The rate seems a little high to me, though. 

Note that we currently pay bills touching the very tippy top of what we can afford. The biggest is $815/month for rent. The mortgage on this home would be &lt; $400/month.

I *do* work in the tech industry, and if something happens to my current job I may run into issues finding work nearby. I could probably work remotely, though. Regardless, it's something to think about.

We haven't even toured the house yet (that comes this evening). I'm just looking for general thoughts and opinions based off of the numbers above and a bit more life experience. Any thoughts are appreciated. 

**Edit:**

- The loan type is USDA, which apparently doesn't need a down payment. We do not have one.

- I'd *love* to sell the vehicle. It was a bad decision. BUT, it's worth less than the loan amount and I don't have the cash to make up the difference. I could easily sell it for $19-20k, I'd imagine.

This leaves $20600, which is a nice chunk of money to put towards savings, investments, and still have a little play money.  That is except for the fact that we have $51000 in credit card debt.    

It is even to the point that we have considered bankruptcy, which I refuse to do because that would be repeating the pattern of my parents.  Luckily, my company contributes a small percentage of my salary to my 401k without me needing to put anything in and I keep the money as long as I am with the company for 5 years (2 more to go) so we have the tiniest semblance  of an investment started.   

I have already been able to convince our two highest credit cards to give us 0% interest on all future purchases (wooo.....), but no luck with lowering the interest rate on the balance (nearly $500 per month at this point).   

We have, up to this point, had a significant habit of big vacations, eating out on weekends, ordering in once a week, etc.  We don't spend much materials, but we spend exorbitantly on experiences.     

Thank you for the assistance.  I understand that our past behaviors are clearly what got us into this mess and we are committed to making steps towards change, but we are both stubborn and like what we like, so it has been hard.

economy,Argument for a Moderate Minimum Wage Increase,"Today’s unemployment numbers said unemployment was down to 5.6%, there’s growth in new jobs but the labor force participation is at record lows. Both of these are downward pressures on the unemployment number. 

Facts:

Unemployment = down

New jobs created = up

Wages = Stagnating/down

Interest Rates = lowest ever, almost no room to move down

GDP = up

Inflation = nonexistent/very low

Analysis:

Low interest rates = cheap capital for corporations

Corporations have access to more capital so they expand faster – these expansions lead to a larger number of goods produced which is why corporate profits have gone up as shown by the increases in the stock market.
Higher profits lead to higher taxes paid. The higher profits come from increased sales – these sales are the reflection of increases in consumption, and since business expenses are a function of sales it also leads to an increase in investment.

The increases in government spending, consumption, and investment put upwards pressure on GDP, this accounts for the GDP growth.

All of these were possible due to the fact that corporations had access to cheaper capital. Therefore,
Low interest rates lead to GDP going up.

Cheap capital = more money to expand

Now that corporations have access to cheaper or more capital, they expand faster with the intentions of increasing their sales. Since profits are a function of sales this also explains the previously mentioned increases in corporate profits. In addition, increased sales lead to increased wage expense, because it is also a function of sales. This growing wage expense means the creation of new jobs.

This is shown in the increases in jobs, which also accounts for one part of the decrease in unemployment (“growth in jobs” mentioned in the first paragraph). Therefore,

More money for corporations to expand = more jobs created

More money for corporations to expand = downwards pressure on unemployment

More jobs created = more people with capital to spend

Since there are more jobs, there are now more people spending money. This leads to an increase in domestic demand for goods. Greater domestic demand should put an upward pressure on the price level (inflation). 

Currently,

More people with capital to spend = very low inflation

Currently, the statistics are telling us that an increase in demand does not lead to an increase in the price level. 

This increase in demand has to be met with an increase in supply in order for the price level to remain fairly unchanged (low inflation). This increase in supply comes from corporations. Their cheap capital allows them to expand and be able to quickly keep up with supply in order to keep prices stable. Companies have an incentive to keep their prices stable because consistency in prices is an attractive trait for consumers. 

Cheaper capital for corporations = more stable prices OR very low inflation

In most cases when you have more people with capital to spend, it puts enough upward pressure on the price level to cause inflation. Corporations are able to keep up by increasing supply, due to cheap capital, to put downward pressure on the price level and keep it stable.

There needs to be another pressure on price levels in order to cause inflation. Increasing wages will give consumers more spending power per capita, and this added demand for goods should put upward pressure on prices. This increase along with increases in new jobs should be able to put enough upward pressure on price level to exceed the downward pressure from increases in supply by companies. This in turn should cause inflation.

Theory:

Increase in jobs = increase in inflation

Currently: 

Increase in jobs = very low inflation

This can’t hold true unless there is an extra factor affecting the equation

Increase in jobs – Increase in supply = very low inflation

In order to achieve the desired state of inflation we should introduce a factor that mitigates the pressure from the increase in supply

Increase in jobs – increase in supply + increase in wages = increase in inflation

So we can now see that stagnant wages are causing very low inflation. How can there be stagnant wages and growth in new jobs? 

So if companies have greater wage expenses than they used to, the only way those wages remain stagnant on a per capita basis is if they are distributed amongst more employees. Which they are, and this is shown by the increases in new jobs.

Companies have an incentive to keep prices stable if they can, but if we increase the minimum wage, this will increase wage expense as a percentage of sales. Prices will change due to internal and external forces.

Internal – companies will increase their prices in order to normalize their margins after minimum wage increases.

External – Increased spending power from consumer will put upwards pressure on demand for goods and on their price levels.

Both of these forces should work together and the market will make them meet in the middle over time. 

However, the government needs to make this happen by increasing the minimum wage, and increasing interest rates. Both increases should be moderate.

I propose increasing the minimum wage to $8.50-9.00/hour and then indexing it to inflation. The current proposals to make the minimum wage $15/hr would make minimum wage only affordable with the current cost of capital, and not likely to be sustainable (with drastic effects to unemployment) in the long run. An increase to $8.50-9.00 would give consumers added spending power while keeping wage expense as a percentage of sales that can be afforded with a more expensive cost of capital (post rate increase).",finance,1420821526

personalfinance,Parent's retirement plans looking grim. Afraid they will work until they die..any advice for a concerned daughter?,"My parents situation:
&amp;nbsp;

* Mom is 66 this year, dad is 64. They own a restaurant which isn't doing great business, but according to them they are not losing money 
* They bring in about $80K salary total for both, about $4500/monthly. They want to sell but owe about $68K in IRS back taxes/real estate taxes, so that would have to be paid off first.  Best case scenario they walk away with $75K after debt is settled- but buyers are far &amp; few
2. They have a house but owe $500K principle on the mortgage- i suspect they used home equity for cash flow at some point.  
* The rate seems pretty low at 2.9% ($3000 monthly over 20 yrs)- is  it worth fighting to see if the bank can go lower?
* House was bought for $350K, maybe worth $650K now including 1 acre yard.  However, house is in disrepair and would need to undergo some major renovations if they were to expect any kind of return.
* Mom says they have $25K worth in CC debt.  Not sure of the interest rate but I'm sure they are high. 
* I've heard that you can call the cc companies to request lower interest rates or shave off the debt if you say you are on the verge of bankruptcy, etc- has that actually worked for anybody?
* They virtually have no savings, my mom is terrible with money (overspending on unneeded things, getting caught up in ""get rich quick"" schemes).  Dad leaves all bookkeeping to mom, unwilling to step up to the task. Not sure he knows the gravity of their situation- but hes basically at the restaurant 24/7 so he wouldn't have the time anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

My situation:
&amp;nbsp;

* My 3 siblings and I want to open some kind of savings account for them that we would put $250/monthly, so total $1000/month.  
* We don't want them to know about it though, as my mom will just think we'll bail her out and continue her bad spending habits.  
* We do not want them to have access until AFTER they retire. Thinking Roth IRA since withdrawals aren't taxed, but if they open it in their name they can make ""catch up"" contributions since they are 50+. Is it feasible to open Roth IRA in just my dad's name, and directly contribute via my bank account?  Or would it be best coming from a checking account (that we would open without mom knowing) tied to his name? 
* The money over the $6500 roth limit would go to some savings account- i guess we'll go with whatever has the highest interest rate? I'm aware there are few that go above 1% though...is this the best option?
* We are working on getting them to manage money better.  Trying to set up a mint account but they always use cash which is harder to track- open to suggestions!

&amp;nbsp;

In conclusion:
&amp;nbsp;

* We would love for them to retire in 3 years (i.e. sell restaurant) and have them live off SSI and the savings account we'd set up for them.  We estimate they would get a little less than $4000/month if they delay they SS checks until 2018.
* My sister thinks we can sell their house ""as is"" along with the mortgage, so my parents would walk away with nothing but at least be debt free.  Has anyone ever done something like this? 
* Once they sell the house (if able), the plan is that they would move to my grandma's 2 bedroom townhouse (completely paid off) and takeover once grandma passes. They would have to pay SF real estate taxes though.
* We'll probably add more money monthly as our own situation gets better.  I am recently unemployed, sister has a baby on the way and my younger sibs don't have the best paying jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

EDITS:
&amp;nbsp;

* They definitely want to retire, restaurant work is hard on the body.  I wouldn't say they are in the best of health but it I imagine it will get worse the longer they work. Our fear is that they'll work themselves into an early grave.
* We already pay about $7K/year for their utility bills.  They never lived a ""life of luxury""- the opposite actually.  After paying the mortgage &amp; gas/food expenses, it leaves them about $600/month? That's why we pay the utilities, so they can save something at least.

personalfinance,A couple of years ago I made a pretty big mistake and now I need advice from someone/some people that know better.,"Ok, so first off I wanna start by saying that I'm new to this sub and I don't know how much you like my kind 'round these parts, sorry if I offend anyone. 

So, I'm a 21 y.o male from Melbourne, Australia and 2 years ago I took out a car loan for $13,000 at 17% (I know). At the time, I was only working part time and was earning about 300. I wanted a car to call my own and a 7 year loan was the only one I could really 'afford' on the car that I wanted.

Fast forward to present day, 2 years into my loan and my girlfriend convinces me that I need to start being a little more financially responsible (she's completely right). I get the statement from the company I took out the car loan with, Esanda,  and realize that I have been paying almost $80 in just interest this entire time *sigh*. I'm in a much better situation right now money wise so I can afford to pay off much more money each week on my loan, but I looked into it only to find out that if I was to pay the loan off within a year I would be slapped with a $3600 early termination fee. I'm currently earning about $550 a week. 

Somebody suggested that I take out a bank loan and pay the car loan off with the bank loan, because the bank loan has a lower % interest rate. But I'm not entirely convinced because then I have to pay the early termination fee from my car loan and most likely an early termination fee from the bank loan, because ideally I'd like to have this all payed off within the year. Right now I don't know what my best course of action would be and this entire situation is stressing me out a bit.

Thanks in advance for any help and sorry for the wall of text.",finance,1420826348
personalfinance,"40yo, no emergency fund, &lt;$35,000 saved. Am I screwed??","Hello everyone.  I’ve been lurking around for a short amount of time and it’s actually gotten me pretty worried that I am going to be screwed if/when I retire.  I took me a while to get my head on straight, go back to college and graduate, and get a decent career.  Here are some notes and details.  I know you guys get this all the time, but if you would be nice enough to give me some advice I would appreciate it.

* I’m about to turn 40 and married with 2 kids.  She makes almost twice what I make, but so far we have kept our finances separate.
* I work a state job making $21.15/hr with anywhere from 1.5% to 2.5% yearly increases.  On a straight 80 paycheck I gross and net about $1700 and $1100 every two weeks.
* I contribute 10% to our state employees retirement pre-tax, and I believe my employer contributes 10.5% (the language is a little confusing, I am waiting on some explanations).  The current balance is $33,700.  **Turns out this is actually a pension plan which will pay me a set account until I die based on years of service and the average of my five highest paid years. The balance just tells me how much I've contributed should I get a different job and roll this over. The company match just helps pay for the program, it doesn't affect my pay out in the end. Sorry for the confusion**

My monthly expenses are as follows:

* Car lease ending 4/2015 - $300
* Student loan payment - $400.  Minimum payment was $257, but I requested a bump to $400.  Interest rate is 4.625% on a remaining balance of $30,700.  I assume the extra $150 is going straight to the principle, I don’t know for sure though.  Should I cut back to the minimum payment until I get a 3 month emergency fund?
* $154 for cable/internet
* $164 for two family cell phones
* Very minimal to $0 balance on my only credit card, which has a $2300 limit.  Currently has a $360 balance due to travel and hotel for a funeral last weekend.

I have no personal emergency fund to speak of, but we do have a joint savings account.  This is not an emergency fund as it is used for extra expenses, to help with credit cards if something comes up and they get too high to pay off with just our paychecks.  I have an auto transfer set up from my checking account for $100 every paycheck into a savings account, but I usually end up spending that frivolously.

I do not have all the details of her expenses to add to the discussion, but we do keep each other informed as to what is going on with our expenses.  The reason we have not combined expenses yet is basically stubbornness.

With today’s paycheck I am dedicated to getting a one month emergency fund ($1000) ASAP.  I would love to know if there is a way to figure out my payoff date on the loan. 

Well, this is me.  If any of you are nice enough to provide me with some thoughts and advice I would really appreciate it.  Let me know if I left out any details that would help you help me.",finance,1420828411

From what I understand, I'll probably be stuck with unsubsidized loans, so they will accrue interest. Again though, they'll be paid off within 5 months (probably sooner)

My only other option is to get a personal loan, but the interest rates were 14%, which seems a bit high. I think the federal loans are lower interest rates.

2 years ago my dad, who had been in the car business for years, broke my clunker and let me drive his car to my internship as long as I made the payments. This car was from the buy here, pay here lot he worked at before and cost about $200 every other week (4-500 a month). Since I was making $2,400/month and my family was in a bad spot, I was just grateful that I wasn't walking to work. Then, a few months later my dad called and said he needed his car back. He called up one of his buddies from back in the day to do me a favor and get me into a new car since ""it is easier to finance"" than a used car. Car had a 13.99% interest rate, which was lower than my credit cards so I didn't realize how bad it was, and all I had to do was trade in my non-working car for the down payment. Apparently, I was lucky this even went through because I didn't have a co-signer and was still in school. I would have put more down, but between paying for his car, paying my own rent/expenses, and handing over a few hundred a month to help him out, I didn't have it. I am grateful to have a car that turns on all the time, and the $330/month + $125 isn't terrible since my monthly expenses are $1200 (half my full time take home pay), but I feel like I should have been able to get a much better rate. Car is a 2012 Nissan Versa that I got new, has crank up windows/locks and nothing fancy. It cost $15,998 after adding gap insurance (which I used twice and has payed for itself already), and I owe about $12k on it (45 months of 72 months remaining). I am working part time making $1200/month and in my second to last semester of college (engineering, so I'd rather not work any more than I am).

litecoin,"Can Litecoin developers and thought leaders do some AMAs or, have some posts?","Litecoin is going through a transition. Its price have reached pre-November bubble era. The last bubble did some goodies and baddies to Litecoin. It got big publicity from media, big ASIC manufacturers got involved, some big payment processors accepted Litecoin and big numbers of speculators entered. 

As overall crypto-currency got hit hard by severe bear trend, so did Litecoin. But price drop is little bit too harsh for Litecoin because of speculators effect. Also, some PnD and scam coins have tarnished altcoin's image. ASIC mining scene does not look pretty, as miners were developed during price rise, they are almost pricey and unprofitable to mine. There is no low cost and well developed ASIC miner for everyday Litecoin miners. Looks like most Litecoiners are in despair. 

Price matters- if it rises too soon, speculators get involved and it hurts everybody when it corrects. If it drops too much people become disinterested and loose enthusiasm (recent posts, dropping difficulty, no new ASICminer for everyday miner) and can work as a negative feedback loop.

I know our developers are working hard, so as our infrastructure builders and thought leaders. But we need encouragement and inspiration from them to fight through this hard time. Future is bright for Crypto-currency as well as Litecoin but not guaranteed unless our leaders does not guide us in proper direction.  Also, we need to involve new people and keep them inspired.

personalfinance,Question about cashing out of a retirement plan and early withdrawal tax penalities.,"I am well aware that in the long term this is not the best idea, but would like some advice so I don't hurt myself in the nearer term.

[This](https://forms.retirement.sc.gov/formGenericGet.do?formNum=web4101.xdp) is the form I have to fill out to withdraw the money, what I am most curious about is the values I should place in section II to avoid unexpected bills at tax time next year.

My high level information:
  $16,000 in the retirement account
 $100,000 household income for family of 4

I figure that I should withold an extra %10 for the early withdrawal  penalty and then another %5 making a total of %15 ""in addition to the required 20 percent federal tax calculation"".  According to [here](http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/south-carolina) if I am reading correctly, I should put 7% in the ""% for South Carolina state income tax""  to ensure I don't have any more tax liability for next years return.

So am I misunderstanding anything in this process?  I was told to expect %40 tax penalty and I am ok with that.  So would %35 + %7 in those boxes should cover any taxes I should owe?  If I wanted to be safe and add extra percent or two would I get that back dollar for dollar in tax returns, assuming no major changes in my personal finance?",finance,1420841457
personalfinance,In default for a school loan - agency unwilling to work with me - is bankruptcy my last resort to get a transcript or are there any less extreme options?,"The loan amount after all the fees is 6500.  I have another major one for 60k where I'll be out of default in a few months, but this one (after 3 weeks of run-arounds) will not do it.  I need the transcript for work and to continue school - and it would of course be nice to be eligible for federal loans but I can pay for state schools out of pocket, especially now that I know better.

Having called almost any number I have been given, I am currently waiting a review from the mediator group (not an advocate on my behalf - just mediator) called Om Bondsman or something, that is like the last resort, but was explained based on this collection agency's actions thus far (I have offered payments to them far above my means just as long as I can get on the rehab program and get outta default because being out of default with my 60k loan will not make me eligible for anything until this clears), the resolution is not going to happen.  

Some people who basically said they have no idea what I can do have made semi-non-serious comments (like off the cuff) to the extent of - ""well, if all else fails maybe you can get a loan to pay off that loan and get out of default that way"" but of course they immediately recognize this isn't possible since who will give me a loan with my credit?  

Anyway - the bankruptcy will not be something I will consider until after I am clear with my 60k loan and of course I will speak with an attorney about all of that at that point if that's my last resort (already have in fact), so that's not what I'm asking - just seeing if there are any other options I have not explored and haven't been told about.

There IS a judgment on this loan.  It is a perkins loan through my school and the 'debt collector' is an attorney (it's a one office firm - each time I call, she answers - so basically she's not some major company like my other collector - she wasn't aware of half of the things I told her about through the DOE site, for instance and actually had me fax over the URL and the page of the section about rehab).  I should also mention she refuses to use paper trail - no emails, no faxes (edit: from her end; **in fact, added question - is there a way I can 'force' her to give me any of the information mentioned here/discussed between myself and her, etc.?**), no confirmations of our conversations of what was said (so she has straight-up lied on many occasions and I have no proof).  She did threaten to sell my loan to another firm should I fail to make a payment this month (but I've been in default for 5 years and she has held it for 2, so.. I doubt she will) and I'll end up owing more attorney fees etc., but I was told by another expert that this was a veiled threat because it's highly unlikely another firm will bother with something this small - on the same expert did tell me that based on their experience if she were to do this, it is much more likely the other creditor will actually work with me since most do (again, this isn't based on my own knowledge, just what I'm told by pretty much everyone - even for cases like this when there is a judgment; in fact, I simply don't understand why she refuses to rehab my loan - say if I make 100-200/month payments instead of 0?  She can garnish (I guess?) but she knows I don't really have any wages to garnish at the moment and most of my work is oversees teaching English, usually as a contractor - so not even sure how that plays out).

p.s. I know this is already a bit long but just as an addendum - the only resort I could come up with with my limited knowledge is.. and I mean this is like.. just as far outside the box as it gets - if I can convince a friend of mine to give me a loan, then use that loan to pay the friend back, get outta default, get some federal help/along with my job and pay the friend back.  I actually don't suck at finances - I don't use credit cards, I had good savings until this month when an emergency wiped them (but I'm quickly fixing that by busting my ass and getting extra work etc.) - so I'm not concerned about paying my friend back - I just really really don't want to ask.  And sadly, I only have that one friend - my (wealthy) parent's attitude is that I deserve this even though I was admitted on a need-based full ride that was taken away due to her/her husband's large income increases - but.. bygones.  


edit:  I am often asked by the people I talk to as to whether my ages were garnished with this judgment and what exactly I mean by judgment so maybe I should clarify here.  The wages have not been garnished (there haven't really been any wages to garnish) nor did the judgment say anything about that (nor has she).  The judgment is simply my school (plaintiff) taking me to the civil court and, with her as their attorney, suing me or whatever the official thing is, for the amount I owe them and being told by the court that yes, he owes you and has to pay you back (I was actually out of the country at the time so I was never served with a summons - not sure if that matters so I lost by default as I was not aware they were taking me to court).  Anyway - that's all I mean by judgment.  

edit2:  On a random note - I know most people here already know way more than this and those who are here and do not are probably here because it's too late but please, if you are considering an expensive school.. don't do it.  I cannot give any financial advice but man - life changes in an instant.  You may be a 4.0 student, and a family crisis happens and everything is lost and economy crashes and you're laid off and depression sets in and suddenly you're just.. well - just don't do it.  There's so much more to it than a simple number on a piece of paper and I wish someone sat me down and said this shit to me instead of telling me things like ""oh you have a 4.0? no worries man, forget transferring to a CC or dropping out"" and so on and so forth.  Really.. 50k/year with a 4.0 and, honestly, aside from grad schools that I cannot enter due to this mess (and those I can afford don't really have such high standards) nobody has ever given a shit.  I was just hired the other day to tutor advanced high school kids by a prominent company in the area and I'm like ""don't you want to at least run my background check?""  Nope.  They saw my experience and it was enough.  I'll never forget my damn school counselors who said pick the best school, worry about money later.  Pick a CC.  Worry about money never.

personalfinance,Digging out of some bad choices - high interest CC debt,"Hi gurus of PersonalFinance! I'm looking for some advice on a few options I have to pay down a high-interest CC that I'm throwing money at but not making progress on.

The card in question is a Discover card, with a current Balance of $11,449.04, and an interest rate of 20.99%. I have been throwing $400/month at this card for as long as I've had it, with no progress being made. The largest part of this was that I continued to carry it in my wallet and use it for ""cash back offers"", but also for anything that I didn't have cash for.

Now I've made a commitment to getting myself out from under this looming debt. I realized that my habits were not only financially unhealthy, but also affecting my well-being, and stopped drinking alcohol. Along with that, the amount of meals that I'm eating at restaurants plummeted. I pulled the Discover card out of my wallet and stuck it in a drawer and have not touched it in months. The current problem is, out of the $400/mo I put on the card, over $200 goes to interest. 

I have two offers in front of me, both of which look like options to try to manage this debt.

1. 0% interest on balance transfers to my Capital One card, for 12 months. This card has a 19.80% interest rate, a $7,150 limit, and I *just* paid it off last month ($0 balance)  
2. An offer for a Discover personal loan, with interest rates ranging from 6.99%-18.99% depending on amount of the loan and creditworthiness  
3. A combination of the 2  

Obviously, I cannot cover the entire balance of the Discover card on my Capital One card. Even if I could, I would not be able to afford to pay $1000/month on it to get it paid off by the end of the promotional period.

Here are some details of my income and other debts:

Gross take-home pay/month: $2,360.66

Mortgage: $426.00/mo  
Internet: $71.75/mo  
Car Ins: $97.42/mo  
Car loan: $200.00/mo  
Discover card payment: $400/mo  
Home Depot card payment: $100/mo (may need to increase to pay promotions off before they charge interest)  
Capital One card payment: $0/mo (right now. I was paying $150/mo, but will have no payment next month)  
Credit Union card payment: $150/mo  
Pandora: $4.23/mo  
Netflix: $7.99/mo  

Utilities are going to cost a fortune for the next little while. It's cold in PA, and my house is not efficient. Right now, I'm estimating:

Water: $45/mo  
Nat. Gas: $200/mo  
Electric: $200/mo

Home Depot|$2,448.94|0.00%|$1,651.00


Note, I have Home Depot listed at 0%, which is only true as long as I pay off my purchases by the end of the promotional periods.

So, I'm pretty sure that's all the information that I can possibly provide... I guess the big question is, how can I knock out this $11,000 debt as quickly as possible, and stop giving Discover $200/month of my money to line their pockets with.

Edit - Credit score information:

Credit Karma: 714  
Discover: 718  
Capital One: 715  

Edit 2 - I keep thinking of more details, sorry... I do have $4,391 in a saving's account. However, that's an emergency fund, plus savings for a new roof that my house is going to need in the spring. I don't really want to touch it. I also have about $12k in a 401k, but that will remain untouched as well.

Final edit- In case anyone comes across this; I applied for a personal load at my credit union, and got a call today that I was approved. The most that they offer was $10k, so I got the full amount at 4.99% APR. They'll cut a check payable directly to Discover, which is perfect because it will keep me from being tempted to spend the money on anything else. I'll make up the other $1,500 in normal payments and be done with it.

economy,Why We Have Low Inflation With Low Unemployment.,"Today’s unemployment numbers said unemployment was down to 5.6%, there’s growth in new jobs but the labor force participation is at record lows. Both of these are downward pressures on the unemployment number. 

Facts:

Unemployment = down

New jobs created = up

Wages = Stagnating/down

Interest Rates = lowest ever, almost no room to move down

GDP = up

Inflation = nonexistent/very low

Analysis:

Low interest rates = cheap capital for corporations

Corporations have access to more capital so they expand faster – these expansions lead to a larger number of goods produced which is why corporate profits have gone up as shown by the increases in the stock market.

Higher profits lead to higher taxes paid. The higher profits come from increased sales – these sales are the reflection of increases in consumption, and since business expenses are a function of sales it also leads to an increase in investment.

The increases in government spending, consumption, and investment put upwards pressure on GDP, this accounts for the GDP growth.

All of these were possible due to the fact that corporations had access to cheaper capital. Therefore,

Low interest rates lead to GDP going up.

Cheap capital = more money to expand

Now that corporations have access to cheaper or more capital, they expand faster with the intentions of increasing their sales. Since profits are a function of sales this also explains the previously mentioned increases in corporate profits. In addition, increased sales lead to increased wage expense, because it is also a function of sales. This growing wage expense means the creation of new jobs.

This is shown in the increases in jobs, which also accounts for one part of the decrease in unemployment (“growth in jobs” mentioned in the first paragraph). Therefore,

More money for corporations to expand = more jobs created

More money for corporations to expand = downwards pressure on unemployment


More jobs created = more people with capital to spend

Since there are more jobs, there are now more people spending money. This leads to an increase in domestic demand for goods. Greater domestic demand should put an upward pressure on the price level (inflation). 

Currently,

More people with capital to spend = very low inflation

Currently, the statistics are telling us that an increase in demand does not lead to an increase in the price level. 

This increase in demand has to be met with an increase in supply in order for the price level to remain fairly unchanged (low inflation). This increase in supply comes from corporations. Their cheap capital allows them to expand and be able to quickly keep up with supply in order to keep prices stable. Companies have an incentive to keep their prices stable because consistency in prices is an attractive trait for consumers. 

Cheaper capital for corporations = more stable prices OR very low inflation

In most cases when you have more people with capital to spend, it puts enough upward pressure on the price level to cause inflation. Corporations are able to keep up by increasing supply, due to cheap capital, to put downward pressure on the price level and keep it stable.

There needs to be another pressure on price levels in order to cause inflation. Increasing wages will give consumers more spending power per capita, and this added demand for goods should put upward pressure on prices. This increase along with increases in new jobs should be able to put enough upward pressure on price level to exceed the downward pressure from increases in supply by companies. This in turn should cause 
inflation.

Theory:

Increase in jobs = increase in inflation

Currently: 

Increase in jobs = very low inflation

This can’t hold true unless there is an extra factor affecting the equation

Increase in jobs – Increase in supply = very low inflation

In order to achieve the desired state of inflation we should introduce a factor that mitigates the pressure from the increase in supply

Increase in jobs – increase in supply + increase in wages = increase in inflation

So we can now see that stagnant wages are causing very low inflation. How can there be stagnant wages and growth in new jobs? 

So if companies have greater wage expenses than they used to, the only way those wages remain stagnant or a per capita basis is if they are distributed amongst more employees. Which they are and this is shown by the increases in new jobs.

Companies have an incentive to keep prices stable if they can, but if we increase the minimum wage, this will increase wage expense as a percentage of sales. Prices will change due to internal and external forces.

Internal – companies will increase their prices in order to normalize their margins after minimum wage increases.

External – Increased spending power from consumer will put upwards pressure on demand for goods and on their price levels.

Both of these forces should work together and the market will make them meet in the middle over time. However, the government needs to make this happen by increasing the minimum wage, and increasing interest rates. Both increases should be moderate.

I propose increasing the minimum wage to $8.50-9.00/hour and then indexing it to inflation. The current proposals to make the minimum wage $15/hr would make minimum wage only affordable with the current cost of capital, and not likely to be sustainable (with drastic effects to unemployment) in the long run. An increase to $8.50-9.00 would give consumers added spending power while keeping wage expense as a percentage of sales that can be afforded with a more expensive cost of capital (post rate increase).",finance,1420848928

personalfinance,(AU) Getting a car loan to keep my home loan deposit intact,"Background:

Australian male, no dependents, HECS debt of about $15,000 coming out at roughly $100 a week. 

Have a home loan deposit of $51,000. Full time job with a net income of about $1150/week + a second job that nets between $200-600 a week depending on how often I work it. 

I need a new car. Current ride is a 1999 model Corolla that I bought for $6000 7 years ago so i've gotten my money's worth out of it ;) 

I can get a new Corolla Ascent Sport Hatch for $22,500 drive away (12 months rego etc). Toyota Finance can ""probably"" get me an interest rate in the 6% category. There is an early loan payout penalty/fee of $8.99 per month (eg: paid loan off 2 months early = $17.98 fee).

My bank advised me to get a loan and keep my deposit (they will lend me up to $570,000 at this point in time). Theory being a car loan won't affect my lending criteria too badly and i've a better chance of having a 20% deposit and avoiding mortgage insurance. 


I'm already going against my finance principles of looking at brand new cars (but i'll keep it for 10-15 years so hey).

personalfinance,I am in a bit of an unusual student loan pickle.,"I finished my education with a lot of student loan debt (federal only). I entered repayment sometime in 2012-2013. Principal is at around $190,000. I immediately consolidated my loans and applied for the IBR program. My IBR application was approved. I spent over a year in repayment while un(der)employed so my payments were very low. IBR set my payments at $50 / mo. Since going into repayment, my loan had been bought and sold by various student loan servicing companies. I think it went from the federal servicer, to Sallie Mae, to the federal servicer again, and then to Great Lakes where it remains today. At all times my IBR payment remained $50 / mo. As you can imagine, while making these $50 / mo payments, I have been accumulating a lot of interest. 

Today, I have a job in my chosen field that pays a good amount of money and I am making much more serious payments on a regular basis. My account still bills for minimum $50 / mo payments, but I am voluntarily paying much more than that ($1,500 - $2,000 / mo, or whatever else I can find under the couch cushions).

I realize that I am supposed to report my income every year to remain in IBR. I haven't reported my income since I enrolled in IBR back in 2012/2013. No student loan servicer has ever requested this information from me. I called Great Lakes and asked them how I should report my new income. They told me that their records do not reflect me ever having been enrolled in IBR. They said that I was in standard (ten-year) repayment status. I said of course I was in IBR. How can I pay off $200K+ in loans in ten years with $50 / mo? They said they had no record whatsoever of me ever having been enrolled in IBR ever, and that my paying $50 / mo was just a strange computer error. What really must have happened is that someone entered the wrong data in an Excel spreadsheet somewhere when my loan was passed from one company to another, but customer service would not admit that. They strangely lacked even the faintest curiosity about the situation.

You're probably wondering: why should I care? You might say, just go ahead and apply for it and get in IBR. Sure, you'll miss out on a couple years accrual on loan forgiveness, but you're making enough money that you might not need to take advantage of loan forgiveness anyway. My problem is really this: I have roughly $30,000 in accrued interest that has not capitalized. This is the interest I accrued when I could only make minimal IBR payments. One Great Lakes customer service representative told me that if I apply for IBR, this sum will capitalize and I will have to pay interest on it. I freaked out and hung up on her. Hitting $30,000 with 7% interest would really hurt. I called another customer service representative who told me the opposite: that the interest would only capitalize if I were kicked OUT of IBR, which is not this situation because their screwed up records do not reflect me ever being in IBR. I asked this second customer service representative if he could give me that assurance in writing. He said he could not. In an email from a third customer service representative, I was informed that interest capitalizes in three situations: 1) entering repayment the first time, 2) losing IBR eligibility, and 3) ""A change in repayment plan."" 

What do you think I should do? Do any of you have a better understanding of federal loan interest capitalization rules than Great Lakes customer service? Am I completely misunderstanding something? Should I apply for IBR and risk the interest capitalizing? Should I do nothing and hope Great Lakes never corrects its error, thus allowing me to pay whatever I want indefinitely without capitalizing the interest? What if Great Lakes corrects its error and suddenly puts me on payments for a ten-year time horizon? Or a seven-year time horizon, if they count the three I've already been paying on? Even though I am making more money now, that would be a tough pill to swallow.

You might say I made a mistake in failing to self-report my income every year. While Great Lakes' policy is to send out an IBR renewal notice every year, they are not technically required to do so. Nonetheless, even if I had been a good boy and timely self-reported on my own, it wouldn't change the fact that Great Lakes has no record of me ever being in IBR. Any income self-reporting would have been received as a new IBR application.

Last year started out with me as a Staff Sergeant (E5, 6 years, USAF) in the military.  I was living on base with my wife and two children.  While in the military I finalized the adoption of my first child (I finalized the adoption of my second child as a civilian after moving to Oregon).  Around September I separated from the military and started a federal job immediately thereafter.  I now make substantially more than I was in the military and could use some guidance as to how to file and prepare my taxes (and if possible a suggestion for my federal tax exemptions and suggestions for state tax).  Here is some information about my finances:

* [Until September 2014] E5 in the military monthly salary - $2555 (pretax) 

* [After September 2014] Federal Job - ~$5600 (Pretax)

* Non Taxable Income - ~$2100 (adoption asisstance)

In the military I contributed to my TSP at a rate of 10%.  I am currently  contributing to my federal TSP (Roth Option) at 10% (which includes a match ""As a FERS participant, you receive matching contributions on the first 5% of pay that you contribute each pay period. As the table below shows, the first 3% of pay that you contribute will be matched dollar-for-dollar; the next 2% will be matched at 50 cents on the dollar."")

Things that have happened during the year: 

* Left the military
* Started a federal Job
* Moved from California to Oregon
* Purchased two cars (paid off one already)
* Finalized the Adoption of two children
* In process (starting phase) of adopting a third child
* Graduated college (Bachelor's Degree)

My plan for the next year is to increase my TSP contributions and start saving for all three children's college education.  I did some research into this and opening a 529 for each of them seems to be a good option.  We have a healthy emergency fund already in place.  

Currently my federal tax number of exemptions is set at 9 (Married).  (Family of four).  I have never had to file a state tax before, but Oregon does have one so this will be my first year with that. My state tax number of exemptions is set to 0 (Married)

Now, onto my tax question:  Given the information above - which is about everything I can think of at the moment - would it be wise for me to seek professional filing assistance or try to file by myself using software (which I have done in the past).  I would appreciate any tax input received and any other general guidance available (such as starting the 529's for the kid's college funds or saving with the TSP/other options for retirement.  I have heard that also opening a private 401k is advised in some situations.).

personalfinance,Tax pickle; I'm a dum dum,"I'm unsure if I should file taxes or not, or if I may owe unpaid taxes. I'm 18, live at home, and my parents are claiming me as a dependent. Through the job that I got 7 months prior in 2014, I was able to make ~$5200 gross. When I got the job, I filled out a W-4 that set my allowances, etc. I believe I mistakenly filled out that form as I claimed exempt status from federal withholding despite my being a dependant last year also. Now that tax season is coming around, I realized my error when I saw my pay stub showing $0 in federal withholding, and that I may ultimately owe the Fed money that they hadn't been taking from my checks to begin with. 

Using an IRS questionnaire, I was told that I wouldn't have to file taxes given my income not being above a certain amount, but I'm still seriously concerned about potentially owing the government money. Can someone point me in the right direction?

She's mid to late 30's and has 2 boys (17 and 16 I think) and a girl (11 or 12.) Her husband had some kind of bone cancer that he battled for a few years before finally passing a few months ago. She's worried about keeping her house and her kids fed and her heat on and whatever else might come up for a single mom of 3 kids. She lives in Philadelphia. What I'm asking for is:

1. What kind of government assistance/grants/money exist for someone in her position? I'd like to be able to hand her a folder filled with resources for her to get to work on applying on what needs to be applied for and contact numbers for the others. I know that she already receives SNAP but I don't know what else. Ideally, she'd qualify for some kind of assistance that includes job training/placement. Also, is there any kind of financial/welfare counselling available to her?

2. What kind of financial advice can I give to her for moving forward? As far as I know she doesn't have any education past high school. She worked at a deli for a few years before she met her husband. And then when they got together, she became a stay at home mom. With those facts in mind, I don't know what kind of jobs she'd really even qualify for. 

I actually own a deli and I'll be putting her to work whenever I have openings, but I also have the rest of my staff to consider already. It wouldn't be fair to them to cut their hours to give to this woman. So I'm trying to come up with a way to help her out in a more permanent way than just being able to give her a few hours per week in my store.

I’ll save the back story and just layout my current situation before I ask for advice.

Background:
Just turned 30
Gross yearly income of $60,000.
Single no kids (For tax and rough idea of spending background)
Not a home owner. Monthly rent is $400

Debt:
$35,000 in student loans. $4,000 of which is at a much higher interest rate than I think typical student loans are, 11.25%.
$8,000  on a 8.5% car loan (Car is worth $5,000 at most at this point)

Savings / Investments:
$18,000 worth of my company’s shares. I put $50 a week into an account which is used to buy stock at a 15% discount once a quarter through an employee stock purchase plan.

$40,000 worth of stock options granted to me (40k is the pretax value after exercising all the options that are currently granted to meat the current stock price). As of today only $18,000 is vested and available to exercise.

401K: I honestly have not monitored this account at all. I have been investing 5% of my weekly income for 5 yrs now which yields my companies max match rate.I believe it's a target retirement account with a retirement date of 2050.

Essentially I have all my non-401k savings in one basket, my company’s stock. Which has only recently began to concern to me. Granted, it has performed great and all signs point to it continuing to do so, we just recently went through a 2:1 split. I stand to gain around $3,000 for every $1 increase in the stock price with that continuing to rise as I invest more through the employee stock purchase plan and continue receiving yearly option grants. This is one of the reason I've left so much of my savings in one place. It feels like the safest and most profitable place for my money at the moment.

However, I do feel it might be time to start looking at moving some of that money out of my company's stock and into other savings options. Only problem is I have idea what that should be. Some thoughts I've had are: exercise and sell enough stock to pay off my debts, start a ROTH IRA which I don't know much about, buy bonds, leave everything where it is, create an account at another brokerage e.g.. Scot trade, E-Trade etc... and invest in other companies.

Another brilliant post by the Brooklyn Investor discussing market timing, hedge funds *that claim to get equity-like returns and low correlation to the stock market* (italicized because not all hedge funds aim to do this), the different risks you can take in the market and their trade-offs. 

There's also a link within to post to a Pzena commentary 

http://www.pzena.com/investment-analysis-3q14-2

""Interestingly, when we compare the volatility of equities to the volatility of hedge funds, we reach some startling conclusions. The volatility of equities falls sharply as holding period increases. But for hedge funds, that is not the case ...""

Pzena Investment Management obviously has a bias to try to sell their services, so keep that in mind, but the numbers seem solid. Here's the conclusion to the Pzena paper for those too lazy to read:

""Since 2008, investors have increasingly focused on short term metrics in making investment decisions, and their desire to reduce risk has driven them to implement various “low volatility” strategies and tactics. Unfortunately all of these actions revolve around the use of short-term volatility data. This seems to be fundamentally at odds with the basic underpinnings of what makes long term investing so successful. The better choice seems obvious: use long-term investment data that better fits with the time horizon of the liabilities that the investment assets support.""  

If you enjoy this post, I encourage to you read the Brooklyn Investor's other posts, they are excellent discussions and explorations of investing. Like any good investing advice, he's basically saying the same thing over and over in a slightly different way.",finance,1420932337
politics,Green Capitalism,"Environmentalist fall into two categories:

People concerned about harm to people and ecosystems:

1. Control toxic pollution.

2. Water quality standards.

3. Conservation of natural resources.

4. Maintaining soil fertility

5. Protecting unique fauna and flora.


These are rational people who consider costs vs. benefits.

And..

People who blame post-industrial society for all of society's problems:

1. Ban GMO's and pesticides.

2. Eliminate any form of energy invented after 1600 AD.

3. Eliminate the domestication of animals.

4. Eliminate all plastics or oil-based products.

5. Prevent large-scale agricultural production.

These are uncompromising fanatics who want to return to a pre-industrial Eden that never really existed by turning back the clock on technological progress.

NEW PRINCIPLES FOR ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
 
1. Accept the role of the free market as the guiding force in human behavior and not state mandates.

2. Incorporate effective economic mechanisms, such as private property, profit incentive and prices, for pursuing ecological and biological protection.

3. Understand the difference between potential and proven reserves and the economic impact of technological progress on resource availability and usage.

4. Accept that externalities dominate all human activities and find ways to mitigate their impact and; that the price system encourages conservation and alternative resource development.

5. Abandon the risk-adverse, zero-impact mentality and develop a balanced cost-benefit analysis taking in account individual variations of tolerance.

6. Accept innovation for meeting standards and not dictating specific controls or methods for limiting pollution.
7. Understand the Kuznets Curve which demonstrates how long-term growth correlates with higher demand for human welfare and environmental protection. 

8. Understand how Moore's Law allows for future technologies to utilize fewer resources at lower costs over time; and how Comparative Trade Advantage enables free trade to conserve resources.

9. Concentrate efforts on protecting communities and individual human beings from direct environmental health hazards.

10. Understand that the greatest polluters are governments and work toward a regime that enforces pollution controls against government actions as well as private.

11. Understand the limits of energy efficiency on conservation imposed by Jevons Paradox.

Threats to Environmental Conservation

1. Public ownership creates a tragedy of the commons for forests, wetlands and grasslands.

2. Prior-Restraint regulation socializes the costs of environmental damage thereby encouraging it.

3. Federal subsidies of dams, irrigation and agriculture damaging wetland habitats.

4. Prohibiting ownership and commercial use of endangered animals hastens extinction.

5. Federal agency exemption from both clean water and clean air standards.

6. Illegal dumping on public lands due to sporadic public enforcement.

7. Eminent domain use on behalf of private interests for risky projects.

8. Public funded insurance encouraging people live in flood zones and coasts.

9. Trade barriers protecting water-intensive agriculture and manufacturing.

10. Reducing the effectiveness and quality of green products via non-competitive subsidies.

11. Draconian wildlife protection laws encouraging wildlife destruction.

12. Economic stagnation and recession increase tolerance of eco-degradation (Kuznets Curve).


How to Fix These Failed Policies

1. Privatize the majority of public lands and aquifers allowing for stewardship and conservation by private actors. Return National Parks to the States so that they can be better managed as smaller budget items.

2. Allow for industry to meet EPA standards by cost-effective innovation and repeal specific -control mandates and replace them with fines for violating pollution limits. 

3. End environmentally destructive hydro-electric subsidies that encourage aquifer depletion and wetland destruction.

4. Allow for the commercial trade in endangered species to create profit incentive for recovering their numbers and relax rules requiring scientific research for the ownership of animal by zoos.

5. Ensure that regulations for protecting water and air from toxins apply equally to the agencies of the federal government as they do for private actors.

6. Increase fines for dumping in public spaces while decreasing the total acreage owned by any given agency and let private owners have a stake in protecting those resources through civil remittance.

7. Repudiate Kelo v. New London, which allows for eminent domain seizures for private use and expand the ability for property owners and communities affected by rails, dams or pipelines to sue for injunctions.

8. Repeal FEMA and NFIP compensation for coastal areas, deltas and floodplains that are too risky for private development by market-based insurance estimates, saving money, seashores and lives. 

9. Repeal or greatly reduce tariffs and farm subsidies that protect intensive agricultural activities from market costs at the expense of aquifers and wetlands.

10. End all subsidies, tax-breaks and no-bid contracts for energy production or energy-saving products to let the market decide the value of green savings, increasing competition and quality.

11. Give property owners an incentive to care for protected species by justly compensating them for the loss of land usage under the rules of eminent domain for public use.

12. Support policies that are pro-economic growth allowing for greater demand for clean environments and a robust development of new green technologies.",energy,1420932417
personalfinance,Should I be aggressively saving money or pay down my student loans as fast as possible?,"Hi Personal Finance. I'm thirty with 67k in student loan debt, and I don't know what to do. I would like your input on my if/then situation. I know I'm not the only one out there struggling with this. 

But before you all go flipping out about how insane my debt-to-income ratio is for a thirty year old is, or how a college degree is worthless, here are some details:

• I received my Masters degree in 2013 and have a career job that I could not have gotten without it. 

• My salary is 47,300, but I taught two classes at the university to add an additional 5,000 this year to my income. Still unsure if these courses will available for me to teach again next year. 

• My income doubled (yes, really) after going to grad school and I really enjoy what I do and where I work. 

• I am currently in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, where I have 62,700 consolidated, as well as a private loan which I owe 4,400. 

• I do not anticipate any major changes in my job as it will take me some time to move up. The only thing I can count on is a 2% raise annually.

•  I really don't have anything majorly substantial in savings, because this is the first time in my life that I've had a semi-decent salary. 

•  I have no credit card debt, a reasonable, affordable car payment, and a very cheap (read: shitty) apartment. 

Everyone is telling me to save, save, save, as I want to buy a house in the near future, and I do not have access to large sums of money for a down payment. However, a friend who is a realtor told me that my debt-to-income ratio is way too high, and will be looked at negatively by lenders. 

Because I am in the PSLF program, my federal loan payments are income-based, and if I continue working in public service, whatever principal I have not paid off in ten years will be forgiven. With that in mind, I'm making the minimum monthly payments - 340 for the federal and 90 for the private loan. 

With that in mind, what do you think: should I be dumping tons of money into the loans to get them paid down as fast as possible? Is that worth it since I'm in the PSLF program, and what isn't paid off will be forgiven? Or, should I continue to pay the minimum and just save whatever extra I have at the end of the month like crazy to establish an emergency fund and to build up for a down payment? Or, should I just give up on my dream of ever owning a home altogether and be at the wrath of crappy landlords forever? 

At this rate, it will take me a little over three years to even get my debt equal to my income. I'll be honest, it's pretty depressing. I've realized that if the option ever presents itself, paying for a wedding is off the table, and kids are absolutely and completely not an option for at least 5 years. Saving for retirement is simply not even something to consider right now.

BACKGROUND: Over the course of the year, I had a gross earnings of 91k. I claimed a 2 on my tax form when I began my job and ended up changing that to a 1 about 6 months ago. In 2014 I paid the following...

Federal Income Tax: $15k
Social Security:	$5,500
Medicare: $1,300
CA State Income Tax: $4,300
CA SDI: $900

Also during 2014, via a family connection, I purchased a home in the state of Vermont for 190k. No money down, owner financed, and am currently looking to rent the property, so haven't had any rental income.

I currently have 55k in student loans that I've been paying on this year as well. I'm unsure how much interest I accrued over the year, but my balance was 58k on Jan 1 2014 and I paid 7k on my loans over the course of the year.

In August 2013, I financed a new Ford Focus 2013 through Ford for about $18k. I believe it was 72 months @ 5.5% interest (payments come out to about $300 I believe). My father co-signed for me so that I can start building credit and lower my interest rate. I do not intend to spend all 6 years to pay my car.

Location:
I live in Northern Virginia.  I'm looking at townhouses that are in the $500k range (3br / 2ba / garage goes for around that much).

Income:
My wife and I make $120k combined; our net take home pay is $6,500 a month.

-$25,000 student loans ($500/month)
-$400/month daycare 
--------
$1,220 recurring expenses.

Our situation:
We have one baby and another on the way. We're currently living in a 2BR apartment and paying $1,600 a month.  3BR apartments go for around $1,800 - $2,200 in this area.

I got a GFE the other day for a $500k property I was looking at and the payment, after 20% down, came out to $2,412 a month.  Anticipating a tax refund at the end of year (property tax and interest rate), my monthly payment would pretty much be what I'd be paying for rent.

My biggest concern, and nobody would be able to predict this, is that I get this ill-feeling that the house price will drop.  The reasons are many (interest rate hike coming sooner rather than later, only 10% below peak levels, etc.) and I honestly can't stomach the idea of the property value decreasing and eating my downpayment (equity) up in a matter of months.  But I think this fear has more to do with my emotions than logic.

personalfinance,Finance question help!- Student loan debt,"Hello,   So I am about 5 minutes brand spanking new in Reddit. Never personally been on this site before now, marginally familiar with it. My boyfriend recommended this site to me, after I was voicing questions to him about my student loan debt situation and curious about possible solutions.  Figure it doesn't hurt to ask.  If additional information is required please let me know. I'll try my best.

Cutting to the chase: I went to an in-state school for 4 years and got my BSN in nursing. I now have a ridiculous amount of student loan debt. My parent's couldn't help at all, but they did take care of all the applications/paperwork for my loans while I was in school. Meaning when I graduated in 2012 and since, have become flabbergasted with the amount I owe monthly. 

I have 2 private loans out with Wells Fargo (variable rates). They are consolidated and so I've been paying $480.06 monthly since 12/05/12. Interest right now is like 6.99% for both. I still have about $51,000 to pay back. 

I have two private loans out with AES/PNC (variable rates). They are consolidated and so I've been paying $553.69 monthly since college (recently dropped to $551.95). I still have around $58,000 left of that one. Interest is 6.44% and 7.41%.

I have like 8 small federal loans out with the government. ""FedLoan"".  They only cost me $135.90 a month (recently went up from the usual $127.00- I think they continue to rise throughout the course of their repayment).    I still have about $28,500 left total to pay back to them. 

All of these I started paying back almost immediately after I graduated in college. To say the least, I am spending $1,168.00 a month in student loans, and this is going to remain this way for over a decade for all of them (if I calculated them correctly...  WF aprx 15 years total, PNC aprx 10 years total, and gov aprx 18 years total... it's strangely hard to find anywhere on your statements when your expected final repayment date is....)   Combining a car payment in there, car insurance, rent, and bills, its overwhelming. My non-flexible bills are about $2,100 a month, and that's not including food/gas/other must expenses. I am a 24 year old, single female.    I am living comfortably and enjoying life still, but finding it impossible to build a savings, and even so, it is accumulating soooo slooowlly that future endeavors seem near impossible (i.e. going back to school for my masters, getting a house, etc..) 

What CAN I do in this situation, if anything?
Should I go talk to a financial adviser? Try refinancing my loans with other companies? Something else more extreme/helpful that I don't know exists? 

I've looked into Obama's ""loan forgiveness"" especially because I work in a non-profit hospital. Of course, that doesn't take into consideration how much you owe, only how much you make. Apparently, I make too much to be considered for this. (Bring home aprx $3,000 a month when taxes are taken out) Make about $50k a year. To me, what I owe and what I'm making doesn't add up nicely or give much room if a financial crisis were to arise (i.e. car accident, getting sick, etc.)  As much as I'm in a tight spot, I'm grateful to have an education job/ good paying good/ financial independence and I understand I'm well off that other people. But this situation isn't desirable/feasible for long term.

personalfinance,Need advice on wife's car payments,"My wife unfortunately made a horrible decision and traded in a year old car for a new one, and piled the amount she owed on top of the new car price.  This was before we met, so I wasn't able to talk her out of it.  Anyways so now we are stuck with a 2012 Nissan Sentra that is only worth 10,000 but we owe 18,000.  I know there is no way to get out of this but to suck it up and pay the car off, but I have some questions about our options to refinance.  Her interest rate is 10%.  We are wanting to take advantage of the lower interest rates now, but we can't be refinanced by a bank because they will only refinance what the car is worth.  Is there any other options we have?  The only ones I have seen is to basically do what she did all over again and get a new car with a lower interest rate and pile the left over 8 grand on top of the car, or to just suck it up and pay it all off at the 10% rate.

economy,A few questions about the US stock market and interest rates,"From [this](http://www.blackrockblog.com/2015/01/06/quick-world-economy/) article on the world economy, I have a few questions from the following paragraph regarding the US:
&gt; Stronger growth buoys corporate earnings and generally should support stocks, but it may put pressure on defensive stocks. Particularly, this rings true for utility stocks. Although the sector benefited from an unexpected drop in interest rates and outperformed in 2014, yields are likely to rise this year. Higher rates do not bode well for dividend stocks and pose an even bigger problem for the already pricey utility stocks.

My questions:

1. What are defensive stocks?

2. Why does stronger growth put pressure on utility stocks, especially?

3. Which drop in interest rates are they talking about, since the US Fed funds rate has been 0.25% for over 4 years?

4. By 'yields' do they mean interest rates, because that is expected to rise this year?

5. Why don't higher rates bode well for dividend stocks? Is it because there are other, better investment opportunities as rates increase?

Sorry about the number of questions. Please let me know if there is another sub where I should post this. Thanks.",finance,1420991724
personalfinance,Loan from foreign parents to avoid PMI?,"Hey, all. First time poster here.

My wife and I would like to buy our first home (in Minnesota), and we've got about $30k in savings available for down payment, closing costs, etc. We're looking at houses that cost about $350k, so we're about $40k short of the magic 20% mark. We're confident we can afford mortgage + PMI payments, but we're looking for ways to avoid PMI if we can.

My parents live in Canada and have offered to lend us $40k (USD) at the same interest rate they pay for a line of credit at their bank: currently about 4%, but it's variable. (Effectively we'd be doing something like an 80/10/10, but with a reasonably low rate on the smaller loan.) The loan would have no fixed term—though for various reasons I think we'd want to pay it off as quickly as possible. Taking the loan would allow us to avoid paying for Personal Mortgage Insurance (a good thing, I think), but I wonder if there are other factors I haven't considered. 

Our combined income is about $120k/yr (I'm self-employed); we have no debt; and I believe we have an excellent credit rating.

Is borrowing from family for a down payment a good idea? Does the fact that the money comes from abroad make it a better or worse idea?

**Update**

Thanks for the replies, everyone! A couple clarifications:

The options under consideration are

* 1) Borrow ~$320k from the bank and pay for PMI
* 2) Borrow ~$280k from the bank + $40k from family and avoid PMI.

I'm not interested in hiding the loan or committing fraud of any kind. According to my calculations, my monthly payments for option 2 would be substantially lower than the monthly payments for option 1 (which would include PMI). I would have thought this fact would make the bank *more* likely to give me a loan rather than less. On the other hand, that could be dead wrong—with option 2 the bank doesn't have insurance in the (less likely) event that I default. 

I'd like to add a third option as well. 

3) Borrow ~$320k from the bank. After closing on the house, borrow $40k from family and immediately apply it to the bank loan.

Does the third option seem like a good one to anyone?",finance,1420994758
personalfinance,"My name has been under my grandma's credit card for years, giving me great credit over time. Now she's missing payments—what do I do?","Hey PFeddit.

Since I was about 16, my grandma's been putting my name with her credit card, building up a pretty solid credit score for myself over the last 12 years. But now as she's getting older and more forgetful, she's been late on a couple of payments. *EDIT: She doesn't miss them because she can't afford it, she just is forgetful.*

With this in mind, I have two questions:

1. What best do I take care of her situation? I know she has a lot of cards under her name and my thought is to consolidate them down to as few as possible and setup an autopay system for her. Does that sound right?

2. How do I make sure that my credit isn't damaged further? I know that closing credit cards can negatively effect your score—If I remove my name from her cards, will that hit my credit score as well?

personalfinance,Dad gave me a financial offer Im not sure if I should refuse? (Denmark),"THE SCENARIO:

I recently finished my studies and have a student loan at around 30.000$ that I have to pay of within ten years. Its a loan from the state with a low interest rate of 1% + the variable interest rate (discount rate) set by the national bank which currently is at an all time low of 0.00% (!). This interest rate might change of course.

Furthermore, I have a small fortune of 43.000$ I inherited when younger. Since a couple of years I have invested in ETF's and my portfolio is doing quite well. That is, I feel sure enough in my knowledge of investments to make me return (at least) 10% on the portfolio per year in the future.

Due to my experience with investments I thought it would be the smartest to let my money work for me and pay of the loan as slowly as possible with the lowest amount pr year.

Now my dad is of a different mentality than me and he would like me to get rid of the loan as quickly as possible and be free of debt. Thus he offered to give me 4.000$ to pay of on the loan straight away under the condition that I provide double that amount - 8.000$.

Now I am not sure if I should take this offer as the return on my investments give me little incentive to pay of the loan quickly.

Anyone have any suggestions if I should take my dads offer or not?

MORE ANALYTICALLY STATED:

I was trying to formulate this somehow analytically to deduce a solution but I don't know the requisite math for this. I see it as I have to choose between the two following scenarios.

1) 8.000$ in investments yielding 10% per year over a ten year period. Compound returns.

1) Or 50% of 8.000$ right now in the hand (4.000$ my dad is proposing me).

Another point is that my dads generosity might be extended if I play by his rules. I know him well enough for this. If I take his offer now he might continuously support me in paying of the loan with 1$ for every 2$ I pay of myself. But this is uncertain.

personalfinance,Start contributing to a 401k or finish off student loans? Discussion of risk aversion,"PF, I wanted to see your thoughts on risk.  I changed jobs last June, but my company doesn't offer a matching 401k until a full year of employment.  Therefore, I've been paying off my students loans with higher interest rates rather than contributing to a 401k.  To clarify, once June comes around I will start contributing at least the amount required to receive the full match.

To optimize the way I use my money, I've been throwing all extra money towards my highest interest loans.  It was nice to see the progress I've made over the last couple years, paying off multiple &gt;7% loans, but just last week I finished off my last &gt;6% loan.  The loans that are left have rates of 5.25%, 5.00%, and 4.25%.

The questions I asked myself was do I still throw all extra income towards the loans (certain 5% return) or start contributing towards a 401k (volatile ~7% return).  In my mind, a certain 6% return &gt; a volatile ~7%, which is why I didn't open up a 401k, but now things have changed.

The question I have for PF is this:  In this situation, at what student loans interest rate would YOU start contributing the extra money to a 401k?  I have already made my decision, but I was curious to see what yours would be.  Thanks.",finance,1420998334
personalfinance,Debt Avalanche Starter Question,"This is my very first post on Reddit. I've been following this forum for a couple months and I've really liked the advice I've seen.

I'm in the process of setting up my Debt Avalanche, and wanted to make sure I was getting the order of my debts set up right. 

I have a total of 7 loans right now (house included) and I've ordered them below. 

1. Bestbuy card
 - Balance: $3,548.81
 - Interest rate: 0%
 - I ordered this first b/c the minimum payment is not enough to pay the card off in the promotion time frame. It's 27% if not paid on time. 

2. Student Loan 1
 - Balance: 14,419.07
 - Interest rate: 4.25%

3. Student Loan 2
 - Balance: 45,209.07
 - Interest rate: 4%

4. Auto Loan
 - Balance: 33,001.54
 - Interest rate: 3.68%

5. Mattress 
 - Balance: 1,574.61
 - Interest rate: 0%
 - Ordered this last b/c the monthly payment does pay the balance off in time. I would still pay it off a month or so early just to be on the safe side.

6. Second Mortgage
 - Balance: 33,757.78
 - Interest rate: 5.25%

7. First Mortgage
 - Balance: 278,400
 - Interest rate: 4.5%

Some extra information: 
1. Current on all loans
2. I will get a bonus at the end of February that should be roughly $20k after taxes
3. B/c I've always known this was coming, I've not paid any extra on this card.. 

Some things I'm doing which I'm no longer sure about:
1. Prior to reading on the debt avalanche, I've viewed the student loans like a mortgage and had them at the back of the list. 
2. I've been paying extra on the truck ($100/month) and the second mortgage (roughly 20/month...rounding my payment to 300 as opposed to the 280 it was) 

After looking at the debt avalance, I'm not sure I should be ordering my truck ahead of my student loans, and so I adjusted it per above. On the flip side, I've read that since the student loans provide interest deductions for taxes, I should hold off on them until later (though I guess the truck does as well). 

So really, I guess my question is: Does the order above look right or should I tweak it again. My plan would be to start this month making additional payments on the student loan 1 that I was previously making on the truck and second mortgage. 

Should the location of the second mortgage change places?

Thanks for the help in advance!

Edit 1: 

I wanted to clarify the zero interest loans:
1. I'm 7 months into 18 months zero interest. So it is due this year which again highlights the urgency in my mind. I think most everybody agrees. 
2. I'm 4 months into 24 months zero interest on the bed. So I still have a while left on this. 
3. I could pay both off today and be ok. I purposely took both out knowing I would be getting my bonus.

My initial intention was to pay of the Bestbuy card and then throw the rest at the truck to get a lot of it paid off. Reading about the Debt Avalanche has made me rethink that approach.",finance,1420999087

the only high value thing i own is my car, which is worth roughly 9k, but is necessary for my job. so i cannot sell it, and the banks i have talked to laughed at me when i offered it as collateral for the loan. they said i would need 1.5 times the request amount in collateral for a loan that high. since i do not own a home i feel like i am up a creek without a paddle. i have recently purchased YNAB and haven't gotten everything set up yet, since my bill change i mentioned earlier, i was thinking it would be best to wait.

Interest rates are allegedly going up (hahah). Oil is in the dirt. Other commodities are down too. http://money.cnn.com/data/commodities/

Europe shit the bed.

I don't know. Something just doesn't feel right to me. I'm basically out of the market now with my taxable account. I sold out early Friday morning. I put the Roth into BCD's because that is the only sector that doesn't look elevated right now to me.

I got out the money I wanted to use in the short term. Decided to pay off a chunk of the house and take the 3.8%. I am pickup pennies in front of the steam roller with my student loans and I still have rental property mortgaged so if rates do rise I can let those chew into it a little though it is an ARM, but I got several more years before it adjusts.

Only one thing I'm relatively confident on. Rates are going to stay low. That means more QE or the market is coming down.

If the market comes down more people are going to flock to bonds and drive the yield price down. So again rates stay low.

If rates rise home loans go up also. That will drive down home prices. So again rates will stay low.

Either way I think bond yields are going to stay low. I don't think the market is going to go up much this year.

I don't see anything that is going to drive inflation in the short to medium term.

Does this make sense? I have about $300-350 in my budget for making credit card payments and I’d like to manage the accounts in a way that pays them down quickest.

She’s served me well, but it’s about that time. I can just feel it. There’s usually something big that goes wrong with it once a year, and I’m getting tired of getting it fixed. The car has been paid off in full for several years.

I’ve just finished building up a 6 month emergency fund, pay each month’s expenses with last month’s income, and I’ve been paying off my student loans (which right now are at around 17K) while contributing employer match to my 401K. Ideally, I would like to pay for a car in full. I don’t need a new car. Used is just fine by me. Something between $6K and $12K, I think, would be nice. 

I don’t have a ton of excess money at the end of the month to save for the car, and I would usually dump all the excess into my highest interest loan anyway. So I guess my question is: What is the most efficient way to save/get a new (used) car when you are paying off student loans? I feel like the best thing to do would be spend a few months saving for a downpayment while paying the minimum on the loans (while still doing 401K match). Then once I have a downpayment, I buy a car with what would likely be a lower interest rate than my loans. Is that better than paying the min. on the loans for 6+ months in order to buy a car in full? I feel like it might be, since it spends the least amount of time paying the minimums.

From about 2012, a Wells Fargo (My bank) CC which I had paid religiously until I had a disastarous few years I am just now climbing out of.

Secondly, is there any way I can pay this debt off with a new CC? Thus rebuilding my credit by putting everything on a very low interest rate card (Capital One), or is this foolish/impossible?

This leads me into my next question...

I do not currently have a credit card, and thus am doing nothing with my credit score and am infact probably hurting it more by only having this outstanding balance as well as school lopans that are deferred on there.

What is my best card option at this point? 

I constantly get letters from Capital One and know they offer an 18 month no interest card or something similar. IF I can throw this $2K on there to start paying off I think that is a really good option, BUT I am financially stable at this point and would like to get the best deal if I know w/o question I can pay my CC monthly bill completely.

Is there another card I should consider if I can?

I am really green on all of this, but really really know I need to get another card and get this debt paid off to start truly re-building financially.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I would be happy to answer any questions.

Also, as for the $2K debt, I am considering paying $300-500 up front and paying the rest off in $200-300 increments if possible, don't know if this is a wise way to go or not.

personalfinance,"Tell me why I should pay off my student loans faster, because to me it makes sense to pay the minimum","I keep going back and forth on this idea of paying off student loans at the minimum rate ($850), fast rate ($1000) or extremely fast rate ($1000+).

My fast rate is something I'm able to pay monthly and save a few hundred dollars a month. Fastest rate would be to stop saving and any money leftover after my expenses for the month would go toward loans. (Note: any money going toward loans is to the one with the highest interest rate) 3 month emergency fund has been hit. 

Loan 1: $20,104.45 (4% variable) - 5 year
Loan 2: $20,638.39 (6.55% fixed) - 10 year
Loan 3  $10,116.29 (5.16% - fixed) - 10 year
Loan 4: $7,046.95 (6.16% - fixed) - 10 year

Reason why I go back and forth. If I pay minimum payments, I'll be paying $850 for the first five years and $460ish for the next five years.

If I go fast then i'll pay $1000/month and pay off my loans in about 6 years 8 months and ONLY save $3000 of interest. 

My biggest gripe to paying off fast is that I'm only saving $3k in interest over that 6+ years. I just don't eye it in that much of savings, when I get to save $150 less a month for 6 years, which could be put into investments and vacations, car, things i enjoy, etc. 

Fastest route, I figure I could possibly pay off in 4 years given my life expenses stay the same, which it probably won't.

To be fair, I think I was a bit reckless and jumped in without looking. I was trading on a 1 minute chart, mostly the AUD/JPY and EUR/USD pairs. 

I reflected on why each trade failed, slowed down and started taking my time. I think I was way to relaxed with my strategy and wasn't patient in waiting for all 3 signals to line up before I executed orders.

My indicator is BB and MACD(12,26,9) - I wait for the MACD lines to cross over at the bottom of the chart for a buy, or the top of the chart for a sell. I also try to wait for the candles to be pressing the lower bound of the BB or higher bound depending. If all these signals line up I jump in. I also check out the overall trend on the 4 hour and see what its doing. If its bearish, I generally feel safer shorting, because any buy signals will usually only be smaller retracements. 

I find retracements are always rocky, with lots of noise because the overall trend is the opposite way, the noise shows up lots on the 1 minute but not so much on the 1 hour and 4 hour charts. I stuffed up a few trades because I got scared with the noise and jumped out at a loss on the spread or a more significant loss.

personalfinance,Considering loan consolidation. Is there a best option?,"Hello, Personal Finance!

I am hoping you might be able to give me some advice. I am a current college student in the US who went through a period of having to live off of credit cards. I am still a full-time student, but I now have a more sustainable income and I am ready to get my finances back on track. 

Currently, I have about $5,500 in credit card debt spread out over 4 credit cards. 

The APR on these cards are terrible--one is 29.99%, two are between 20-25%, and one is about 14%. 

The main issue, though, is that my debt-balance ratio on all four cards is pretty high (almost maxed out), and it's starting to seriously (and negatively) affect my credit score. 

So, I am considering consolidating this debt into a personal loan or private student loan. (Unfortunately, federal student loans are not an option.) I have a co-signer available to secure the loan if need be. 

Essentially, my questions are: what would be the best option for improving my credit and reducing total interest paid? Personal loan or private student loan? Or, is there another option? Also, is there a lender that would be better than another?

I realize contributing non-deductible Traditional IRA is silly, so I am interested in doing a ""back-door Roth"" going forward.  However, I have existing balance of money and conversion is pro-rata so had a question on whether this makes sense from a tax perspective or what I should do?  
  
Below are the amounts I contributed each year - $25,350 contributions and $4800 net gains = $30,150

* 2015 - $5500 (non-deductible)
* 2014 - $5500 (non-deductible)
* 2013 - $5500 (non-deductible)
* 2012 - $5000 (non-deductible)
* 2011 - $3850 (believe this was from Roth IRA re-classification)  

= $25,350 cost basis + $4800 net gains since 2011

My current salary is ~$200k, I'm single, 32yo, I have $0 debt except for my 4% home mortgage, $200k in money in my bank account, very little stocks, and I contribute to the $17.5-18k 401k cap and get my employer match.  I am beyond the Roth IRA contribution limit and expect my salary to rise over next several years.

Should I go ahead and do this, make sure I don't withhold any federal taxes and pay those additional taxes which would leave my Traditional IRA account at $0 and then each year contribute $5500 to Traditional and then immediately convert over to my Roth IRA each year?  Are there any reasons to NOT do this from a tax standpoint or retirement investment standpoint (e.g., will this increase my tax rate/bracket or have me double-paying taxes or have any kind of conversion or withdrawal penalty)?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans aggressively at the risk of having no savings for the next few years? (UK),"I have about £20,000 in student loans that I need to start repaying in a few months after I start my new job. The minimum monthly installment that I need to pay is about £400, but I calculated that after paying rent, utilities, and other expenses, I can afford to shell out £500 a month for my loan. This will leave me with close to nothing to save every month, but £1,200 a year towards my loan would obviously save me quite a bit in interest. I'll also be getting a sizable starting bonus, which I'm planning to use entirely towards my loan because that would bring down my payment period from 5-6 years to 2-3 years.

I don't expect any huge financial difficulties coming up (but then again, no one does) and in my mind it's better to skimp for 2 years and then really save rather than drag on for 5 or 6 years and still only have a very small bank balance. I originally planned to put away £1000 from my bonus and save it for a rainy day, but then again that's also money that can close this loan out faster.

Is it just too risky to have no savings today or is it worse to have debt pile up? Thoughts, comments, suggestions are all welcome.

personalfinance,What to do with my paycheck (retirement and school),"Hey PF!  Looking for some advice.
 
Here’s a quick breakdown of our financial situation.  I’m 23  with an annual income of about 20k after taxes.  We live entirely off of my husband’s paycheck, with the except of a few small bills from my paycheck.  We have no kids, no debt, and about 10k as an emergency fund.  As we are in quite favorable standing financially, I really want to start saving for retirement early and while we have the spare funds.   I am ineligible to contribute to an IRA because we are living overseas (my pay falls under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion) and it would not be beneficial to try for the Foreign Tax Credit.  My next logical step would be to throw as much as I can towards my 401k, but that is where I am a bit lost.  Almost all of my options mean nothing to me because I have little experience with investing and don’t really know enough or recognize enough to make an informed choice.  I suppose the Retirement 2055 is ideal since I can pretty much forget about it, but I am leaning towards the Vanguard options.  Are there any in particular from this list that I should avoid?  Which would you recommend opting for?  My options are [here](http://i.imgur.com/09iuWRe.jpg)
 
I should add that I will only be with my current company for another year and a half, and that I hope to be a federal employee in two years.  My current employer matches up to 5%, which I have been contributing to thus far, and has 100% vesting after 5 years.  When I leave I will only hit 25% vesting.  Should I choose an aggressive, higher risk option to hopefully gain some ground in my year and a half?  If  I did manage to gain a federal position I would want to rollover my 401k into the TSP options offered.    
 
This fall I will also be going back to school to get a Bachelors.  I am writing my heart out in scholarship essays and hoping to avoid student loans if at all possible.  If I receive no outside funds, the most I would be looking at is around 12k a year for the full four years.  With this in mind, should I even be contributing more than my employer’s match?  I don’t want to short my retirement, and I’m afraid if I don’t start socking it away now I will never get in the habit of doing it.  I can’t remember if it was somewhere here on PF or one of Vanguard’s Insights, but a line that stuck with me is, “Do you see people here offering loans for your retirement?”  With our constant moving to foreign countries (we intend to stay overseas as long as possible) I realistically would not be employed in my degree field, but a BS would increase my chances of higher pay if I went federal.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Oh and here is my paycheck breakdown.  I get paid about $850 every two weeks.

- $250 intended for Roth IRA but possibly going to 401k instead?

- $200 to my CD (funds can be added at any time)

- $150 to savings

- $45 phone

- $40 to stashed cash

- $25 to Heifer

- $20 for gas

- remaining $120 for whatever I want, usually some goes towards the CD

Frank needs a new car. He wants to know if he should buy the car cash-in-hand, or if he should buy the car by financing. 

If Frank buys the car outright, the amount of money he spends is equal to the cost of the product.

    cost of buying up front = cost of product

If Frank finances, he'll get to hold on to most of his money, but he'll have to make monthly payments plus interest. During the term of the loan, he could invest his money and actually earn *more* than he pays in interest.

    cost of financing = cost of product + interest on loan - interest on investment

As a general rule, if the interest on the investment is greater than the interest on the loan, he should take the loan. But how do we run this calculation to prove it? 

[I made a spreadsheet so you don't have to.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GcGnLIEUGsRrGQzZU_LPWXIHhEtJzcO83nGmH5pV89o&amp;authuser=0) You can save a copy to your Google drive and modify it as you please.

Frank wants a car worth $16,000 &lt;B2&gt;, and he is willing to put up $3000 &lt;B3&gt; for the down payment to get a better interest rate. He can borrow the money at a 1.25% interest rate &lt;B4&gt; for a loan period of 24 months &lt;B5&gt;. At this point, the spreadsheet estimates a monthly payment of $527.60/mo. The final calculation shown in &lt;E3&gt; shows that to be 24 months, but if it didn't, Frank could modify &lt;B7&gt; until &lt;E3&gt; equaled 24 months. Alternatively, he could get the number from his lender. Finally, Frank looks up the interest he is earning on his investments. Based on past performance, Frank believes he can earn 7% on his [Life Strategy Conservative Growth Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0724&amp;FundIntExt=INT#tab=1), so he puts that in field &lt;B8&gt;. 

According to the spreadsheet, over the next 24 months, he will pay $176.61 in interest on the loan, but he will earn $1,068.79 on his investment. Buying the car this way will make it cost $892.19 *less* than it would cost to buy the car outright. 

&gt;*Question 1: What if the investment doesn't yield 7%?*

If the investment yield is less than 7%, Frank will earn less money. He will only *lose* money if the actual interest rate is, on average, less than the interest rate on the loan.

&gt;*Question 2: What if Frank needs the money?*

If Frank has an unexpected bill he needs to pay, it shouldn't come out of the car fund. If he cannot otherwise pay the bill, he can liquidate the investment and start paying the car note directly out of his paycheck. In most situations, your monthly payments on debt should not exceed your monthly discretionary income. If this still isn't enough, then Frank should declare bankruptcy. 

Keep in mind that if Frank had bought the car cash-in-hand, he would need to liquidate the *car* to get money out of it. This is substantially more problematic, as selling cars is difficult, they depreciate in value quickly, and Frank probably needs the car to get to work.

&gt;*Question 3: Should I borrow as much money as possible to maximize my earning power?*

**NO!** Your minimum payments will start to clog up your cash flow which can cause real problems. If you ever end up sick or in a bad spot, you will need regular cash flow to keep you going. 

If you have more than double the value of your total debts in the bank, it might start to make sense to run up your monthly minimum payments beyond your monthly income, but that kind of spending can be very risky.

**TLDR: Given the assumed numbers, buying a $16,000 car costs only $15,107.80 if you finance. This is one example of good debt. You can play with the spreadsheet to get a better idea of what good and bad debt looks like.**",finance,1421094214

personalfinance,Think about where your emergency fund is...,"A big part of the idea of an EF is that you loose some opportunity cost by putting your money in a more secure account with less growth so that if something comes up (layoff, medical emergency) you won't have to borrow money at a really high interest rate (i.e., you loose 6% interest gains on some money so that you won't have to pay 17% if something bad happens or taking a loss because you have to cash out during a downturn). With that in mind, sticking the money in a savings account is a good plan especially when interest rates aren't so low.

However it is good to really think about other scenarios.  What if your identity is stolen?  What if your primary bank gets hacked?  It might take a few days (or longer) before you can get everything sorted out and regain access to your money. 

A few things to consider:

* Keep at least some of your EF with a different financial institution than your main one. Sure there is FDIC insurance, but I imagine it probably takes weeks to actually get your money back. If you go with a primarily online account make sure you can still access the money quickly. 

* The most liquid thing is cash.  I don't believe having *tons* of cash squirreled away, but I do have $300 in earthquake prep kit.  I figure it is enough to get my car out of an impound lot or show good faith for paying rent if my accounts got hacked it was taking a few days to sort out.

I really don't want to but I feel like I should and I also feel like I shouldn't.

**SHOULD**

* They're my parents, obviously, and they fed and clothed me for 18 years.

* When I was in college, I was on their car insurance so in a way, I owe them.

* My mom wanted to buy my wedding dress last summer so she gave me $600 towards it. 

* My parents traveled to my city and got a hotel room for my wedding and I know that was a big expense for them.


**SHOULD NOT**

* They moved out of state like 4 years ago even though it was a massively bad financial idea.

* My dad is insistent that his self-employment is the way to go, even though in the best of times, our total household income was ~$24,000 (4 people) and most of the rest of the time, far below that. His 'company' has been around since 1990 and he is his only employee. 

* My dad is insistent that his self-employment is the way to go, even though he has to make a 1200 mile round-trip drive once a month back to our home state because he's not making any money in his new state because they just don't have much of a market in the new state. 

* My mom has been ""looking"" for a full-time job since...well probably twenty years now. She doesn't have a degree and is also older and very heavy-set (so: knee pain, hip pain, arthritis, etc) so I get not wanting to work retail and be on your feet all the time, but...She does do occasional jobs like babysitting, elder care, etc.

* God gets all the glory if it works out. When it doesn't work out, it's because it's not God's time yet. And I just want to say, ""OR MAYBE, real actual living people actually make good choices and THAT'S what makes it work out. It's not magic.""

* My childhood house was foreclosed on right after I graduated high school and has since been demolished and I'm still kinda really upset about that. 

* They have cable. THEY. HAVE. CABLE. (Which makes me mad but on the other hand, it's like the one luxury they have...but...SERIOUSLY?)


Also to add to this, I am recently married. We are still figuring out how to put our money together so it's currently separate bank accounts and then we split rent and kind of take turns picking up the tab at restaurants/grocery store. I feel like this kind of things (lending/giving parents money) is something you tell your husband even if it's only coming out of ""my"" money. It's super embarrassing though and I know that he knows that I am not happy about the choices my parents have made regarding jobs and money.

As far as ""can I afford it,"" the answer is...kind of? I will have to take it out of my savings account (of which I have $1200ish at the moment which I know is paltry). I am trying to pay off credit card debt (I owe $900) and student loan (I owe $23000ish), I already have a couple unexpected expenses coming up this month. And I am definitely not going to ask my husband to give my parents money. 

I recently (as in, November) started using You Need a Budget and that's really the first time I've actively worked on budgeting. In the past, I would just set up stuff on mint and then...Paycheck-to-paycheck mentality would kick in and a lovely credit card to boost it up, so I just didn't look at it and it all worked out. (Until recently when I decided I wanted to destroy my student loan but can't unless I actually STICK to a budget).

So this was a really long thing and I apologize. I wish they had never asked me because now I have to say something either way. How do people handle giving parents money?

personalfinance,"Newly unemployed, looking for advice","Long time lurker of this sub, using a throwaway for anonymity. 

On Sunday of last week, I made my final payment to my largest and highest-interest student loan. It was such a wonderful feeling! $15k at 9.6% interest, paid off in a year. The next day, however, I was fired from my job without warning. I failed to build a significant savings, as I was aggressively attacking my most outstanding debts. Since November, I had been promised a promotion, a significant raise, and a large bonus as of the first of the year, so I was planning on contributing the full bonus to my savings at that time, and beginning to build that up while paying the lesser debts. Obviously that's not going to happen now, so I'm trying to figure out how to get by.

My current situation is as follows:

* Savings $2300
* Car payment - ~$9k total, $230/month
* Car insurance - $100/month
* Federal student loans (10 loans remaining, at varying values and interest rates ) - ~$38k total, $415/month
* Perkins student loan - ~$3.8k total, $45/month
* Rent - $550/month
* Internet - $85/month
* Food - planning on the pasta and broccoli diet, which runs me about $30/week
* Pet care - ~$45/month, but I stocked up on enough supplies to last for a couple of months the weekend before I was fired

I registered for unemployment as soon as I was fired, and have received an estimated income of $420/week if approved. I say IF, because the co-founder of my company technically fired me, saying that I had produced poor quality work and missed deadlines. Fortunately for me, my boss and all of the managers/other employees I worked with had just submitted my reviews a few days before, and all were extremely positive and contradictory to what he said. My boss had absolutely no idea I was going to be fired. I feel the co-founder may be trying to get around taxes, as 5 other VERY talented people (also up for promotions) were fired in the same week. My exit contract is all messed up, date-wise, and says that I'll be paid through February, even though I was told I already received my last paycheck. I'm having to jump through hoops for unemployment right now. But that's a legal issue, and not for here.



All of my bills for the month of January are paid. I have a credit card with $0 balance, and $3500 credit limit; I'm thinking of paying my bills with that, and paying the minimum due with my savings until I can find steady work again. Is this wise? I'll need my savings to pay rent. Also, should I set my student loans up for deferment, or PAYE?

I'm fortunate enough to be in a field that's in very well-paying and in high demand, especially in my area, but my very strict 24-month non-compete is severely limiting my options.

personalfinance,Grad Student Loan Repayment with a Twist,"Hello,

Thank you all who post here for your thoughtful and helpful advice. As a smart young woman, with a whole lot of debt but a good head on my shoulders, I seek your advice today.

I have great deal of student loan debt following grad school. Before grad school, I made a great salary for my age, but in a role with limited growth. I assumed I would be able to limit costs by working a lot during school, even while having one incredibly demanding, time-consuming chronic disease. 

Then those plans were shot when I came down with epilepsy. Which was undiagnosed until the end of grad school, but put a major damper on my ability to perform beyond my already demanding program requirements. 

For several months after school, I was not earning income above survival level, so remained in forbearance. Once properly tested and treated, I got a great salaried job. However, my school was expensive. 

For the numbers, my options, as far as I can see, are:

1. Pay down debt for 10 years at $1650 per month.

2. Enter an IBR program and invest to prepare for the tax bill in 25 years.

I would love to pursue option one, but given my medical costs outside of insurance (par for the course with the conditions I have), I cannot do that unless I ask for significant family assistance. I do not want to be an extra burden to family members, even though some have suggested there is a way to set up a repayment plan to them at a lower interest rate than my loans. 

If I enter IBR, I understand that I could theoretically have my outstanding loan amount forgiven in 25 years but expect to pay tax on that amount. This option seems reasonable, so long as I can save and invest in preparation for the tax bill that year. 

My chief questions at this moment are (with the caveat that I seek human intelligence and have reviewed as many online resources as possible in addition to speaking with financial services and my loan servicer at this point):

If I enter an IBR program, am I able to pay more than the monthly payment without penalty when I am able?

If I enter an IBR program and my income increases significantly, will I stop qualifying, or encounter other downsides?

How do I calculate AGI when my salaried position began in August of 2014? 

What can I do with any money I can set aside to invest in preparation for the tax bill in 25 years if I remain on IBR? 

If my income increases so that I stop qualifying for IBR, what consequences can I expect? 

Thank you for your help. I hope to post words of wisdom here when my path forward is clear.",finance,1421102385

On the same day as the conference, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg will issue an opinion on an earlier bond-purchase program known as Outright Monetary Transactions. The case was referred by Germany’s Constitutional Court after it said OMT, though never used, probably overstepped the ECB’s authority. 

The ECJ’s non-binding opinion, which will be followed by a ruling four to six months later, may influence any QE design. The German court said OMT would likely violate European Union rules that forbid the ECB from pursuing economic rather than monetary policy, though it could be legal if limited and placed under certain conditions. Should the ECJ spell out those limits, they could be applied to QE. 

The ECB is already considering some of the concerns, with Chief Economist Peter Praet telling Germany’s Boersen-Zeitung last month that options include making national central banks assume the default risk for the debt they buy. 

This was taken from http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-12/ecb-s-public-debate-on-qe-intensifies-as-media-window-narrows.html and if the rulings are unfavorable to asset purchase programs, there could be some serious volatility in the EURUSD and Stoxx 50.",finance,1421109123
Trading,Whistleblower feels vindicated after SEC exchange sanctions,"Whistleblower feels vindicated after SEC exchange sanctions
By PATRICK TEMPLE-WEST
 
1/12/15 4:59 PM EST
Congress should consider strengthening stock market laws to prevent high-frequency traders from gaining unfair advantages, according to a whistleblower critical of the industry who said he feels vindicated after the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday struck its largest ever settlement with a stock exchange.
For more than three years, Haim Bodek, a former official with UBS and Goldman Sachs before he started his own high-tech trading business, said he warned the SEC about alleged violations at Direct Edge, a stock exchange company that settled with the agency for $14 million. The SEC said the fine was a record amount paid by a stock exchange.
Part of the SEC’s complaint against Direct Edge said the company allegedly collaborated with two, unnamed high-frequency trading firms. Their cooperation likely helped both participants make more money, the SEC said.
“The story here is these high-frequency trading strategies don’t even work at scale without asymmetry built into the market,” Bodek said in an interview. “They are building in handicaps and cheat codes.”
In December, Bodek briefed a bipartisan group of about 20 House and Senate staffers about high-frequency trading.
“I’d ask Congress if it is appropriate for two high-frequency trading firms to tune an entire exchange’s order handling process around their strategies,” he said. “Should they have the right to do that as a customer of the exchange? Is that consistent with the ’34 Exchange Act?” he said referring to the 1934 Securities Exchange Act that created the SEC.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, SEC enforcement chief Andrew Ceresney declined to comment on Bodek or any role he might have played in the Direct Edge settlement.
“These [Direct Edge] exchanges did not properly describe in their rules how their order types were functioning,” Ceresney said. “They also gave information about order types only to some members, including certain high-frequency trading firms that provided input about how the orders would operate.”
Stock exchanges offer a large number of complex order types that can boost revenues for the exchanges and traders. In December, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said the agency is reviewing exchanges’ order types for possible reform.
Separately, Bodek’s public criticism of order types has been cited in a lawsuit against stock exchanges filed by several pension funds that alleged billions of dollars of retirees’ investments have been lost to these schemes.
Bodek acknowledged he gave the SEC whistleblower information about Direct Edge’s order types and could be eligible for a piece of the SEC’s $14 million thanks to lucrative incentives provided by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.
“I can’t comment on any award,” Bodek said. “This particular settlement vindicates the position I’ve had for over three years.”",finance,1421110356
personalfinance,Need advice on what payment to accelerate first,"So I graduated from college last May and started my first job in December. From college I have about $32k in student loans left with about $7k of that having a 7% interest rate (the rest of it has a pretty low interest rate). I also am making payments for a car. Currently, my monthly payments are ~$300 for my student loan and ~$210 for my car payment. I also owe my father $3k for using his amazing credit to get me a low interest rate and for making the downpayment on my car. 

I make $61k a year pre-tax and am estimating having roughly 1.5k disposable income each month after taking out utilities, rent, loan payments, etc... The thing is that I don't have much left in savings due to paying off student loans while in school and because of my relocation for my job. Currently I have $3,900 in my checking account. I was planning on saving at least $10k for a rainy day fund before accelerating my payments. When this happens however, I was thinking of a few options:

1. Accelerate my car payment first
   * $300/mo to pay back my father
   * $300/mo extra (so $510/mo total) on my car
   * This way, I could pay off my car in 2.5 years vs. 6 years
   * After paying off the car, I would refocus that $510 into my student loan.
2. Accelerate the high interest student loan, then switch to car
   * $300/mo to pay back my father.
   * $300/mo extra (so $600/mo total) to student loans.
   * This way, I could pay down the principal for the $7k loan in a year

personalfinance,cashing out 401k versus HELOC loan.,"I currently live in the home in which I grew up; as my mother moved out of town and it sat vacant, paid off in their divorce, I moved in to save some money after prior roommates got married/purchased their own home.  My mother recently advised me that due to her financial situation she needed to sell the house.  It's approximately 1k square foot, 3 bed/1 bath built in the 70's.  Nothing grand, needs electrical work and central heating/air installed so I can obtain homeowner's insurance (not covered due to no thermostat to control temp).  On the high end, I expect to pay $25k for the house and another $10k in repairs.
  My job was displaced at the end of November-2014, I receive my last check next month along with my 12 week severance.  With the severance I will have no debt aside from the $15k I owe on new car just recently purchased (will be keeping).  The car has a 2.25% interest rate, that I will pay an additional $1,087 in interest over the 6 years versus paying off today.  I have approximately $50k in a 401k (probably 90/10 for traditional/roth) that I can't quite decide what to do with after I get company match in March.  I have a true interest in stocks, but admittedly have not done my due diligence.  
   I am 28 with a 3 year old girl; separated from her mother.  I typically have her thurs-sunday every week, paying $240/month for daycare (just thurs-fri).  We have no legal agreement at this time, just what we've been able to agree to for almost the past 2 years.    By the end of this year, there is another woman that I plan to be with, we have discussed and are working to set expectations for living together.  She has 2 children, therefore the house I am considering purchasing will likely not be ours.
  Sticking with the high end, if I need a $40k HELOC (can go against house as mother will transfer title), I’ll qualify for at worst 3.25% interest, requiring a $391 payment/month to payoff in 10 years, resulting in $6,900 in paid interest.  I have a desire to further my education (physical therapy/massage no less) rather than work full time, but will be working part time.  
  While feeling like an adolescent child amidst my indecision, my question is to the advantages/disadvantages of cashing out my 401k to purchase rather than borrow, for the lost earnings in interest versus the savings of interest paid in loan.

MY DEBT

-Owe 60k in Stafford student loans @ 6.55% interest rate. Currently set up for the most long-term repayment plan they offer, resulting in me paying about $350 per month (although I have been separately paying much more). I originally set it up this way because I had two other student loans with much higher interest rate, so I paid the minimum on the low-interest and threw as much extra money at the high interest that I could. Those two are now paid off.

-Owe $23k on a 0% apr credit card with a total credit line of 35k. Currently making minimum payments. 0% apr expires February of 2016, and I plan to pay the balance completely by this date at the latest.

-Owe $6.5k on a 0% apr credit card with a total credit line of 19k. Currently making minimum payments. 0% apr expires June of 2015, and I plan to pay the balance completely by this date at the latest.

My main question is, what should I do to put myself in the best position for buying a house? We want to buy a house in the $400,000 range. My understanding is that I’ll get the best interest rate on a mortgage if I am carrying less debts. In that sense, the ideal situation seems to be to pay off my credit card debts and student loan debts before applying. However, this is not realistic, as we are looking to buy a house within the next year. As such, how much of my debt should I pay off before I start saving for the down payment? Should I just maintain the debts and start saving for the down payment now? I’m trying to figure out where that “line” is. Of course, no matter what I do, I NEED to pay off the 0% apr credit cards before those rates expire.",finance,1421163783

I come to you looking for help with my relatively complicated, but I think increasingly typical, financial situation. I've done some searches, but everybody's situation is different, and I cannot find a thread that is directly on point.  My hope is that some of you more knowledgeable people will be able to help me decide on an approach to get rid of my student loans. Specifically, I need help deciding between two repayment options.

**Background information about my situation**:

I recently graduated from law school. I was one of the lucky graduates that was able to get a job upon graduation. Last month, my firm asked me to move down to Southwest Florida to assist in establishing a new office down. Additionally, I am engaged to be married in April. As we prepare for our life together, my fiancé and I are trying to determine how best to proceed with our student loans.

**Financial info:**

My salary: 100k a year + 15k annual bonus  - I think it is reasonable to expect that this will increase in the next few years because I also have a 20% equity stake in the new law office.

I do not yet contribute to a 401k as there is a 1 year waiting period at my firm before I am eligible. I also have not yet started contributing to a Roth IRA.

Fiancé’s salary: 72k a year – She currently pays just under $380 a month into a thrift savings plan (she works for the federal government).

We have 1 car that is totally paid off. 

We’d like to start saving to buy a house and a new car (I will become a daily commuter once the office is established).


**Student Loan Info (this is where I need your help):**

**My student loans:**

*Federal loans*:

$80,014.65 @ 6.8% [$906 monthly payment]

$25,226.77 @ 7.9% + $35,574.57 @ 6.41% [710.72 monthly payment]

Total outstanding principal = $140,815.99 


*Private loans:* 

$31,109.14 @ 5.20% (variable) [$249.50 monthly payment]
$18,361.28 @ 3.12% (variable) [$140.12 monthly payment]

Total Outstanding principal = $49,470.42

**Fiancé Student loans:**

*Federal loan* = 21,347.40 @ 6.5%



I’m split between two different approaches for paying back the federal loans. 

*Approach 1:* Apply for Income based repayment and pay the difference between my monthly payments under the standard repayment plan (above) and the income based repayment plan towards the principal of my most expensive loans until, eventually, I pay off all my loans. In short, use IBR to free up monthly capital to direct toward high interest loans using the ""avalanche' method.

*Approach 2:* Apply for the income based repayment plan and pay the absolute minimum with an eye toward getting as much forgiven after 25 years as possible. The approach is described in detail at this link:  

http://www.edcentral.org/beware-savvy-borrowers-using-income-based-repayment/


To be honest, I don’t even know if approach 2 is viable (I am horrible at math and I haven’t been able to find a IBR repayment calculator that allows for forgiveness). Can anyone help me decide how to approach my situation? I will be happy to add more information if it will help you all assess my situation.  

Also, if anyone has suggestions that are unrelated to student loans – I am all ears. My fiancé and I have no experience with finances and find that becoming “real adults” is quite a daunting task.

We own two dogs, two cats and have a fish tank which is why our pet bill is pretty high (this includes average vet visits over the year, etc.). That many animals however reduces the number of viable options for renting in our area. This is one of the cheapest places we could find that has a yard for the dogs.

I am a full time college student making on average $1,812.50 per month from my G.I. bill and an additional $258.83 per month for disability. My fiance brings home around $2,400 per month. All of these numbers are net.

I'm majoring in computer science in the DMV area so career prospects look great but I'm still a couple years from graduating.

We are investigating houses with yards nearby that are under $150,000. I have access to the VA home loan so I don't need a down payment and in the worst case an interest rate of around 4.625%. I expect even with home maintenance that our monthly expenditure would under $1,000 per month, saving us a pretty significant amount of money. However, we are considering moving out of the state after I graduate so we may only be in the home for a few years (if I'm stuck here an extra year or two trying to sell the house/find renters, that's fine).


Is there anything I'm missing when it comes to buying a home? I feel like we need some amount of cash on hand but I'm under the assumption that I can just buy a $130,000 house with a $150,000 loan and cover any immediate problems.

I'm looking at all of these numbers and feel like an idiot but I don't know anyone I can trust for real advice. I did fill out the NYT rent vs. buy calculator and it was heavily in favor of buying but I feel like adding that much debt is probably the last thing we should do even if it does make life much more affordable right now.

personalfinance,Home Equity Loan to pay off debt and establish emergency fund,"Hello Personal Finance, I understand that taking unsecured debt and turning it into secured debt is generally a bad idea. However, I am at a loss for what else to do in my situation. My bills are currently $2487 per month and my take home pay is $3080 per month leaving me approximately $600 a month for gas and food for myself and 2 teenagers.

$600 a month of  my bills goes towards paying (minimum payment) on credit cards ($12000 total) and another $479 (24,000 total) for a car payment meaning I am spending over 1/3 of my income servicing non mortgage debt. 

I am saving $53 a month to start an emergency fund, but I keep having minor emergencies deplete it and usually add to my credit card debt.

I currently owe approximate $78,000 on my home which is valued at $165,000. I can get a Home Equity loan of $55,000 on a 15 year repayment for a 6.5% interest rate meaning my monthly payments on the loan will be $479. I was planning on paying off the car, my unsecured debt, spending $3500 on home repairs and sticking the remaining $15,500 into a savings account at a new bank as a 6 month emergency fund. 

I then plan to increase my savings rate by $150 a month, increasing our current standard of living by $300 a month and having the extra $150 a month as cushion to either pay extra on the debt or in case of minor things such as doctors appointments, broken glasses etc.

Finally my end goal will be to refinance the house completely in 6-12 months for a 15 year VA IRRL loan, the current rates for which are ~2.7% through my lender. I could do a cash out refinance up front, but there are high fees and closing costs to consider where as taking the Home Equity loan and then slipstreaming into a IRRL would not carry the same fees. Obviously the downside of that is that interest rates could rise during the time between the Home Equity loan and the IRRL (I was told there was a waiting period of 6-12 months VA couldn't seem to agree).

Does this plan sound okay? I absolutely have to get away from having every little emergency screw me over and right now there is almost no room to trim my budget any further and increase my savings and/or debt payments. Where as I can use the Home Equity loan to reset my debt and put me on the right track. Obviously I will need to avoid the credit trap, but considering I have stopped the shopping and am now only using them to supplement cash payments for emergencies ($500 deductible after accident, $470 for plumbing repairs) due to my non existant emergency fund I believe I will be okay.",finance,1421171337

personalfinance,Pay off student loan or car?,"Hello all. I recently moved back in with my parents (~6 months ago) with the aim of paying off some debts. I've already tackled CC debt, so now I'm wondering which loans I should keep and which to pay off.

Some background info:

 * 24 years old

 * $60k/year income (~$3100/mon after tax, 401k, etc)

 * $10k E-fund 

 * ~$24k Student Loan @ 6.55%, 9 years left. Payment is $310/mon. 

 * ~$12k Car loan @ 3.14%, 4 years left. Payment is $290/mon. 

Those loans are my only outstanding debt. I'm able to save ~$2k/mon at the moment. 

At first glance, it appears wiser to me to pay off the SL, with a higher balance, higher interest rate, longer term, and no collateral. However, I am upside down on the car to the tune of ~$3k, which while not a huge amount isn't ideal. It would also allow me to lower the insurance on the car, which is not a problem for me as I have a spare car for emergencies (paid off). I also don't have GAP, which I wish I had purchased now. This means paying off either would amount to ~$310 in savings per month.

I was initially planning to stay at home for ~2 years, but I don't think that is sustainable for personal and logistical reasons. Seeing as the loans affect me more or less the same each month, paying off either one would free up enough cash in my monthly budget to be able to move out and still hit my previous target savings of ~$1k/mon.

I'm leaning toward the car since it would let me move out quicker (~6 months sooner). I plan on attending grad school this fall (free), so moving out and being closer to the university/work/friends would be more ideal than staying at home for ~12 months. I am also able to deduct the SL interest on my taxes, which is ~$1100/yr, which is not huge but better than the car.

I'm coming to the end of university, and having done a mixture of hard saving, selling old things I no longer had use for, and a few lucky stocks (getting in and out of Royal Mail was a thrilling highlight), I now find myself with around £12,500 (Just over $18k), and I'm not entirely sure what exactly to do with it.


I had previous ideas of doing a Masters course, which I may still go on to study for, but even then I still would have around £2,000 spare at the least (I'm not sure if this would help me in the job market, but that's a question for another day).

Obviously even after food we have plenty left over each month to add to savings or paying off debt.

Instead, the US and Chinese stock markets are making record gains and appear much more stable than the btc market.  Obama tells you the economy is great, but it is a myth.  Ours and China's economy is severely propped up by the rampant printing of currency, near 0% interest rates on debt, quantitative easing, and a military force that threatens other countries to keep trading in their respective currencies ""or else"".  

Btc will look enticing again only when the stock markets fall and large investors begin to look for more secure routes to invest.  The Cyprus crash was a testimony to that, when btc climbed faster than any other time in history as the world saw how fragile their currency could be.",cryptocurrency,1421189481

robotics,Senior Design Project Ideas - Autonomous Vehicle to Delivery Gold Ball into Target Bin,"Basically was just assigned my senior design project. We have a group of 5, and are supposed to design a vehicle that autonomously navigates a wooden course with a couple of turns and small inclines (124 inch path in total). At the end of the course, the bot is to drop a golf ball into one of three bins 11 inches below with those closest bin being 7 inches away and the furthest at 18.5 inches (more points awarded if delivered to the furthest bin). The bins get progressively smaller going from 6, 5, 3.5 in^2 and the ball is manually fed into the bot at the beginning of the course (golf ball is 1.68 inches in diameter for reference). The bot is to be housed in a 11x11x11 in^3 space but may expand upon being deployed. All power is come from batteries and are to use sensors to obtain info about the course. The bot has 10 min to perform task of delivering ball into the bin as many times as possible. All parts are to bought within a budget of 375 dollars. 

I know this is a pretty broad project with many aspects, but what I think you guys could possibly help out with is ideas for three parts - 1. the vehicle setup with the drive in mind 2. deployment mechanism to shoot the golf ball into the bin and 3. recommendation for what sensors to use on the bot for it to navigate through the course.

Really appreciate it guys. Excited to see what additional ideas we can explore with this!",technology,1421194994

In May of 2014, I  got a secured card from Capital One with a $200 limit, though just recently they upped my limit to $500. Sometime in June or July of 2014 I got a new car. My dad is the primary on the loan from Navy Federal with me as a secondary. In July of 2014, I got a cash rewards credit card with a limit of $1000 from Navy Federal.

Though I don't know how accurate/official their tracker is, according to Capital One's credit tracker, my credit has improved from 591 to 662. 

My question is, where do I go from here? I've already thought that I should talk to Navy Federal about either switching me to primary and my dad as secondary on my car loan, or just taking him off completely if I can handle the new monthly payment. I also wanted to see if I could switch my secured card to unsecured with Capital One, but it seems from what I've read that they will ask you to close the account and open a new one.

- 770 credit score
- Single income, no dependents
- 0 credit card debt - I pay it in full every month
- I own my car so there are no car payments

**Debts:**

- $48,000 student loans remaining (initially $100,000) at 3.25% interest
- $500/mo student loan payments
- $900/mo rent

I can barely afford to make the payments and its putting all of my finances out of whack. How likely is it that my bank (navy federal) to allow me to sell the vehicle, give the title to the buyer, then refinance the amount less the amount i get for the car as a personal loan? as far as i can see that seems like a long shot but it will significantly reduce my monthly payments and also eliminate the insurance bill every month.
for clarification: I would still be paying the amount of the loan, it would just be minus what i sell the vehicle for. the closest example i can think of would be that of a repossession, where they take the car and sell it and you still owe the difference, i mean, the bank would then presumably give the title of the vehicle to the new buyer, correct?

personalfinance,Got a new job. Boss is taking taxes and not reporting them.,"I graduated in the summer of 2014. I believe I claimed exempt from taxes, because I only had work study jobs where I worked less than 20 hours, weekly.

In November, I worked a temporary job through an agency, and made about $350. I refiled my W-4 at that time, to make it not exempt. I claimed myself.

In December, I got a job at a very small entertainment company. My boss gave me my first month's salary in cash, and he claimed it was because they had not set up the company account. He, in front of me, took out $400 for ""taxes"", which is actually correct for the 2014 tax table. So, my total salary for 2014 is around $3000.

I thought it was weird, but I said whatever. I just asked him for a W-2 for my last paycheck. He seemed a little weirded out. I told him I needed it by January 31st. Then, he said, ""Well, I might have to give it to you in February. We're hiring someone else, so I'm going to get someone at the bank to do payroll.""

I told him that it had to be before February, as it is federal law. He then said okay, and turned back to his work.

Then, he came back to me and asked if he could give me the tax money back, so I didn't have to pay taxes. I firmly said ""No. I had other jobs prior to this, so I need my W-2 for my records.""  I then asked him, politely, what happened to the money taken out for taxes. He told me it was simply in the company account.

He says okay, and that he will talk to the bank this week.

I look forward to your assistance; thanks!

- Horrific debt: $14,755 in bad credit card debt that has been charged off; I don't know who owns the debt and no one has contacted me. $3,296 in a no interest state loan. They currently take my state tax refund each year and no one has attempted to contact me. $18,231 in a federal student loan that has defaulted. I am currently figuring out how to attack this.  
- Total debt: $58,185  
- Total savings: $20,000  
- Retirement savings: $0  
- FICO: 628 w/ 5 negative accounts  

If you can believe it, this is a much better situation than I was in 3 years ago. I have clawed myself back from the edge of the cliff and I am in a position, with the right budget and outlook to fix my life. Here are my monthly expenses:

- Utilities: $80  
- Car: $466.98  
- Phone: $100.67  
- Car insurance: $77.55  
- Gym: $209  
- Gas: $80  
- Netflix/Google Music: $16  
- Miscellaneous (dry cleaning/hair cut/AAA/excise tax/registration/etc.): $100  
- Total current expenses: $1730 not including food  


All of the rest of my money is now liquid. I take home ~$5500 a month after taxes and I receive a $1,700 after taxes bonus each 3 months. I currently have ~$3770, minus food and social expenses that I can use per month. I know I need to do the following things which will reduce this amount.

- Max out 50% company match 401k at 6%. They match 50% up to 6%.
- Try to contribute $5,500 annually to Roth IRA.
- Figure out a plan to fix my debt.
- Figure out a savings plan. Pay myself $1,000/month in savings.
- Take out 2 secured/potentially unsecured credit cards to build revolving credit. Buy gas/groceries and pay the balance each month. Attempt to utilize 10% credit each month.

This being said, rent is exorbitant in my area. My rent is going to more than triple when I move out of this apartment. I have to leave in the next few months. I'm looking at units in the $1,800-$2,000 range. I could move much further away and potentially find a place for $1,200-$1,400, but it would add 2 hours per day to my commute and the added expense of gas and wear/tear. One of the bonuses of these apartments that I'm viewing is that they have great amenities including free coffee ($50/mo. savings) and free, really nice gyms with free weights ($209/mo. savings). 

Is there a way for me to fix my lack of retirement, retain and grow my savings, get me out of debt and afford a $2,000 apartment? It seems like there should be a way to make the math work if I'm relatively frugal with my extraneous spending.

Obviously if I live off top ramen and food harvested from the garbage, trade in my car for a bicycle and work a second job as a barista I'll fix my financial situation faster at the cost of happiness, my significant other and my friends. I work 60+ hours/week and I want to enjoy myself while being responsible with my finances. Thank you in advance for your help.",finance,1421202476

My broker emailed me today and wrote:

""FHA recently announced a new program where we are able to refinance your existing FHA loan into a new FHA loan with a lower rate
( 3.75 % new / 4.25 % current )  ) and a greatly reduced monthly mortgage insurance premium ( $ 307 new / $ 460 old ).... If we started the refinance soon and closed it by the end of February, the only money you would be required to bring to closing is an amount equal to your March mortgage payment.""

My first question is am I being taken for a ride? I really like this broker, he and his team were always responsive, friendly, and gave me straight answers.  Getting this 8 months later just raises some questions like should I have negotiated more aggressively back in May?  Are there really ""new"" FHA programs announced recently?  I googled FHA refinance and found some paragraphs on FHA Streamline Refinance, a program meant to reduce FHA loan interest rates.  Is this what he's talking about?  If I do the Streamline refi now and the rates go lower (I know, I know... but what if) can I only do the Streamline refi once?

My second question is whether this is a good thing for us to do?  When I enter the numbers into my mortgage excel sheet (slightly revised excel sheet I downloaded from Khan Academy) and compare our current situation to what we would be paying if we refi, it looks like a great opportunity.  But I've never refi'd before and I'm curious what questions I should be asking in a refi?  Are there pitfalls I should be wary of?

==============
Current loan:

Original Principle $435,897 

Interest Rate 4.25%

PMI  $460 

Monthly Payment (including taxes and insurance)  $3,784.79 

Rental income: $2,850
==============


==============
After Refi:

Current Principle $429,739 (I'm assuming this is the amount I'd have to refi for)

Interest Rate 3.75%

PMI $307

Montnly Payment (estimated in excel) $3,477.63 

Rental income: $2,850

Cost to refi: $3,800
==============

So if I'm understanding this right, it'll take 13 months before we break even, but then we save about $300 on each of our mortgage payments.

I don't see a downside - is there one?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin price drop explained - Year 2014,"Let's digest 2014 

1. it was the year, where HUGE companies like DELL / Microsoft and atleast 5000 smaller merchants in only Taiwon, adopted Bitcoin. 
2. Huge amounts of Fed coins were put back into circulation, when it was sold on auction. {Some are kept in storage}
3. Miners are dumping almost ALL coins back on exchanges to be converted to fiat to pay for electricity costs etc. 

So the situation now, is this : 

We have HUGE amounts of coins being sold for fiat, more than previous years. {Merchants like Dell / Microsoft is definately not hoarding coins}
We have coins being brought back into circulation, which was previously hoarded. {Hoarders buying products from these NEW merchants coming in}
We have Fed coins, perceived as being back in circulation. {Previously, the Fed protected those coins and it was not availlable to the public}
We have a higher percentage of coins being converted to fiat from the miners side. {As the price goes down, they have to sell more coins to pay for the electricity}

The result : 

There are more coins availlable, and this push the price down. 

The solution : 

1. Merchants should hoard some coins, and not convert everything directly to fiat {In the long run, this will increase their profits}
2. People buying coins from the Fed autions, should see this as a long term investment and slowly put them back into circulation. 
3. Most difficult option - Miners will have to find ways to reduce the amount of coins, they put into circulation. {What they are forced to do now, will even hurt them more, in the future}",cryptocurrency,1421222629

I am 23 years old and went to a private university. At the time my parents kept my 17-year-old self in the dark about the financial aspect. They had  great intentions of assisting me with college, bless their hearts. Their own financial situation did not go as planned.  After graduation I was shocked to see $120,000 in loans. I cried and was furious with my parents at first. I know they had the best of intentions, but what a scary burden for a 22 year old. 

I have worked since graduation as a nurse. I work for the United States Public Health services.  I work hard and am incredibly passionate about nursing and the underserved populations. I recently returned from two months in Liberia caring for Ebola patients. I love being a registered nurse and am thankful I have found a way to help others. 

I find myself a bit overwhelmed my financial circumstances. Because I am apart of the United States Public Health Services I receive all military benefits.  I make a little over $51,000 annually and would consider myself pretty financially responsible. My car is paid off. I live with three roommates everything included I only pay $381 a month for rent. A gym membership and some auto and renters insurance combined are less then $130 a month. 

I work hard and like to be able to have some fun money to visit family and friends and live a normal life. Yet how do I balance such large amount of loan money? And save for my future? Have money to start a family someday?  Buy a house? Etc.. It all feels overwhelming. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Option 2: Heloc with balance of 62k, technically  interest-only for another 8 years. Interest rate is variable and currently 4.5%.

From a Ramsay perspective I feel like the correct answer is 2, plus it would gradually make a difference in the monthly minimum owed. However we can deduct that interest and not from the SL.

financialindependence,FI/ER ~10 years ago at 36--AMA,"**Pretty much done, folks, although I'll check back occasionally. Thanks again for the interest. We hope to see your ""I made it!"" posts appearing in this sub very soon.**


First off, thanks for the interest. My wife and I are passionate about FI/ER and hope somebody will find this AMA helpful. Although our approach is conventional, the conventions exist because they flat-out *work.*

I apologize for the wall of text, here, but for a while now I've been meaning to write down the specifics of our FI/ER plan as a review exercise. It might be presumptuous of me, but this AMA seems like a good excuse to do it. So here’s our take on seven of the major elements in our plan: mindset, debt management, mortgages, investing, landlording, LBYM, and what to do after making it. Take what you find useful; disregard the rest. I realize some of it’s redundant to what the group already knows. And again, apologies for the length.

**Our background**

We FI/ER'd 9.5 years ago, at 36, after 12.5-year corporate careers, on ~$1.2 million in investments plus the value of our house, cars, and daughter’s 529 ($40K at the time.) Our current net assets are ~$2.2 million, including house, cars, and 529 (now ~$61K.) [Verification of investments from our Morgan Stanley account.](http://imgur.com/roL7JeD)  We’ve withdrawn ~$500K since ER. 

Edit: I've said elsewhere in this sub that I dislike 529s because in our experience they're substandard investments both for their returns and the lack of control over your money they give you. But /u/bpg609 has done some good work on my head on this subject, and I'd like to say that after studying market-wide returns and the proliferation of better vehicle options since I first opened my daughter's 529, I'VE BEEN WRONG about this. 529's are better than I thought. Mistake made; thinking adjusted.

We live on $48K a year, own our house outright, don't incur federal income tax liability, and don't owe social security. $48K started at ~4% of our portfolio and is now ~2.7%; roughly the same as an $80K salary, skimmed 20% for taxes, and decreased by a $1.5K/month mortgage payment. ~40% of that $48K comes from dividends/interest. We've haven't adjusted that $48K for inflation since we ER'd. Haven't felt the need to.

We're NOT debt-free just now, but I'd argue that what we're doing is more like a temporary liquidity swap. Explanation to follow. 

Getting here was hard but we got some lucky breaks. That luck wasn't exclusive to us, though. Others can engineer it.

First, we were lucky to live in a major city with a high cost of living where we earned salaries that were good compared to cheaper places but more like middle-class in ours. At the peak of our income mine was $150K-ish with a decent bonus; my wife's was $65K. We also bought, rented, and condo-converted a three-apartment building. 

Second, we were lucky to learn frugality early on. My grandparents as kids damn near starved to death in the Great Depression. They knew how to get by on nothing and they handed that knowledge down.

Frugality enabled us to bank a bunch of our income. And when we'd we'd made the nut, we split for a cheaper region. The appreciation on the real estate we sold in Metropolis paid entirely for the house we bought in Podunk. Geographic arbitrage is a beautiful thing.

And third, I think we were INCREDIBLY lucky to be conceiving our FI/ER plans in the mid-nineties just as laptops and spreadsheets were becoming widespread and FI/ER methodology was proliferating across the internet. That made it easier for us to learn strategies and tactics, collect data, come up with plans, test them, adjust them, and build contingencies around them. Otherwise we'd have been dancing in the dark. People just now entering this lifestyle may not realize what a colossal advantage technology has given them.

Unfortunately I have to split this into several pieces to conform with Reddit's post length requirements. I linked them together into a sort of ToC.

personalfinance,Question Regarding Potential Collection Fees (Medical Debt),"New here, trying to conform to sub rules, sorry if I mess up.

I had about $325 from a medical procedure by my specialist doctor that my insurance wasn't covering. Every time I had an appointment, I paid $25 or so towards the outstanding balance. I know it's on me for not keeping up with the remainder, but at one visit last year, the receptionist said I was all paid off, so I took her word and that was that.

In reality, I still owed about $180, and I went over 2 months without an appointment, so they apparently sent it collections last May. I went back to paying my usual $25-30 each visit, and never received any call, statement, or other communication from a collections agency. Now I'm down to my last $100, but $65 of that is a fee they tacked for sending it to collections. I'm trying to look it up again and can't find it, but I thought I've read before that it's either federal or state (I'm in NJ) law that the debtor don't have to pay for the original creditor's charge by a CA.

I see my doctor tomorrow, so if that's the case, I'm going to pay the last $35 and change, and tell the office manager that I'm done and the charge isn't on me.

Options:

1) I currently have $41k in government loaned student debt (paying it off aggressively at $1.1k/month) with the highest interest rate at around 7.5%. I could dump it all into the loan with the highest interest.


2) I have a Roth 401k through my work (but I stopped contributing when I found out they don't match) with about $1.2k in it, and another $6k in a Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target date fund (total retirement savings is about $7.2k)


3) My current car is on it's last leg and will die any day. I'm hoping to get a new or used Honda Fit as soon my current car no longer functions, I need a car for work. New would be around $19k total, and I'd prefer used, I just haven't seen many used with low mileage around my area.

I have excellent credit and should be able to get an interest rate below 2%, and I have also saved around $6k for this exact purpose. I could use my refund money and the $6k to put a large down payment on the car, OR I could put down the smallest down payment and request the lowest monthly payments and put the $6k I saved towards my highest interest rate student loan (and the refund on option 1 or 2).

This leaves me about ~~$2500~~ $2000 for food, entertainment, shopping, and long term financial goals.

I have 3 major financial goals:

(1) I currently have around $5,000 in high interest credit card debt. I built it up to cover for an unexpected shortfall in funding (dad lost his job) and was ignorant about other options such as private student loans to supplement my federal loans. By the time I graduate it will be in the neighborhood of $6000-7000. I just was approved for 2 cards with a total of $3800 in credit that are offering no interest for balance transfers for 15 months, so that will buy me time for a decent chunk of it, but I need to pay the rest down as aggressively as possible.

(2) I want to build up a $12,000 emergency fund

(3) I want to contribute as much as I can to retirement beyond the 401k matching.

I also have a very manageable amount of federal student loan debt ($15,000 at rates from 3.86-4.66%) which I'll have to pay about $150 per month towards starting 6 months after I graduate.

There's a lot of general info on here that describes situations like this as very sequential and set in stone, i.e. pay down high interest debt --&gt; build emergency fund --&gt; max IRA --&gt; max 401k, but I'm wondering if there's a middle ground since retirement contributions at my age will pay off in the realm of 1200+% in 40 years.

During my harder years,  I very foolishly got myself way deeper into credit card debt than I should have.   Currently I have a little over $10k with an average of about 17% interest.  This is only the CC debt,  my auto loan and student loans are much lower interest rates. 

Lending club indicates that I could qualify for a loan for my cards with an interest of about 10% and a fixed payment schedule that would be paid off in about five years.   It is about $10 less than my combined monthly CC payments at this time.  More importantly to me,  I like that it has that fixed end date I can work towards.  There are supposedly no prepayment penalties. 

I want to effectively end my over use of cards and plan to close the remaining ones,  is this a good plan or would there be something more effective?  My goal is to take any money saved and put it towards my car loan or student loans to reduce long term interest on both.",finance,1421277743
personalfinance,"About to start first ""real"" jobs and feeling unprepared for the dramatic increase in income","Like the title says, my wife and I are both about to start our first ""real"" jobs after grad school/post-docs. Our current combined gross income from postdoc salaries is ~$95k which I know isn't terrible in absolute terms but it's pretty low for where we live (Bay Area).


With the new positions that we are taking we will have a combined gross income of ~$235k with a lot of upward potential from there. I'm feeling a bit unprepared for such a big change and was hoping for words of wisdom and advice from the PF community.


Just for added context: our primary current costs are $2000/mo in rent, $1400/mo in childcare, and $650-700/mo in food. Through grad school and our postdocs, we have lived relatively frugally (crappy small apartments, shared 10 yr old car w/130k miles, not eating out frequently, only going on trips paid for by work, mostly commuting via bike, etc) and as a result have scraped together $37k in a 403b, $10k in our emergency fund, and just under $55k saved in relatively liquid investments toward a downpayment on a home. Our only current debt is $65k in student loans that I have from my undergrad and Masters (highest interest rate is 6.8%). Our new positions will allow us to move to a considerably cheaper location (still in CA) where we intend to buy a home later this year. My wife's employer will provide our mortgage at a 3% interest rate and no PMI.


My current plan is to not change our general standard of living beyond purchasing a home - which I realize is a big, expensive, change but is something we really value for raising our family. The net added cost of the mortgage payment over our current rent will probably be about $1k given the prices of the homes we've seen in the market we are relocating to. But otherwise, no new car, still not taking trips to the Maldives, not eating out all the time, etc. 


Surplus from our initial paychecks will go toward increasing our downpayment for the house to about $65-70k. But after that I'm planning to focus the bulk of the increase in our income on building our retirement fund by maxing out both IRAs and employer match programs, paying off my student loans, starting a 529 or similar account to save for our child's college, and slowly saving for our next (used) car. 


What else should I be considering? Does my tentative plan seem generally reasonable? Are there specific things that I should anticipate to come along with such a big shift in income (beyond considerably higher taxes)? I realize I probably haven't provided enough detail for a thorough analysis, but I'm hoping it's enough to provide some limited context to inform the general thoughts/advice that I'm looking for.

technology,Secret Recording Devices,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As technology advances and police departments use more and more recording devices as part of their everyday duties, this case will serve as an important guidepost for when such devices may be used without a warrant.&lt;/b&gt; In short, this case will provide strong legal support for police officers to be able to use recording devices without a warrant in situations where the officers already have a legal right to be in the location being recorded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advancements in technology have allowed small, compact, sometimes hidden audio recorders to become incredibly prevalent.&lt;/b&gt; These small audio recorders can now hold hours of audio on a small memory card instead of unruly tape recording, making them a great solution for everything from recording lectures at school and business meetings; to obtaining information on a cheating spouse or unscrupulous employee. In addition to voice recorders, secret recording devices are available for telephone equipment as well – allowing you to monitor and keep a log of all conversations on business and home phones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is legal for a person to record a wire, oral or electronic communication if that person is a party to the communication, or if one of the parties has consented to the recording, so long as no criminal or tortious intent accompanies the recording.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, the rules regarding video recording are in fact different from the rules that apply to voice and telephone recording.&lt;/b&gt; Strangely enough, the federal and state wiretapping laws only protect the interception of oral communication like voice-activated recorders and phone tap systems. The statute does not ban video recordings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bottom Line, you may record phone conversations in which you are a party to, however it is illegal to record conversations had by others without consent of at least one party.&lt;/b&gt; When it comes to cellular and smart phones, whether you can legally access the contents is largely dependent upon the authorization of the owner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are no national statistics on how frequently such secret recordings take place, but smartphones and other pocket-sized devices have given employees and employers a powerful tool to easily record playbacks of sensitive workplace conversations which are legal in some states and illegal in others.&lt;/b&gt; The recordings can be used in court or administrative hearings--or subject the parties involved to public criticism. Many cases involve disciplinary proceedings or union organizing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.spygearco.com/FitnessTrackerVoiceRecorder.htm"" target=""_new"" atomicselection=""true""&gt;&lt;img style=""margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px"" alt=""Secret Recording Devices"" align=""left"" src=""http://www.spygearco.com/Images/MiniGadgets/4203_WEB.jpg"" border=""2""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://www.spygearco.com/FitnessTrackerVoiceRecorder.htm"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;font color=""#0000ff""&gt;Secret Recording Devices&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like the Fitness Tracker Voice Recorder is a voice recorder will fit in anywhere.&lt;/b&gt; Designed to look like a normal fitness tracker, you can wear this right on your wrist and record everything around without drawing any attention at all. Let it record all day with it's long battery life of up to 20 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The simple single button operation makes this device the easiest way to start recording covert audio anywhere, anytime.&lt;/b&gt; The removable band also means you can take the main recorder and fit it in to even the smallest of spaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most researchers use audio recordings for individual interviews as a way to capture what is said during the interview.&lt;/b&gt; In most cases, these types of interviews do not qualify for exemption and it is necessary for you to obtain consent (and assent where appropriate) to use an audio recording device. In the protocol form, you need to explain what you will record and justify the necessity for using an audio recorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look for an audio recorder app that provides an audio sensitivity adjustment to help match your audio signal to the device.&lt;/b&gt; Alternatively, use an external preamp or mixer to do the matching. As a last resort, consider using microphone placement to compensate for audio levels. Many mobile devices have hardwired Automatic Gain Control or AGC circuits. There may be no getting around it, so do a couple of test recordings and make adjustments for the best compromised settings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regardless of the hardware or software you choose, there are several things that will help you capture and deliver the best possible recordings from your audio recording devices.&lt;/b&gt; Don't rely on the built-in microphone or even the included microphone preamp in your mobile device. While some are pretty good, an external preamp will be much better if you can use one.&lt;/p&gt;

personalfinance,What the fuck do I do.,"My parents cosigned on $60,000 in private student loans for me. They came due in December and I didn't receive the bills, nor did I think about it because I was led to believe that my parents had taken care of it (e.g. taken out the loans in their name and were paying). 

Nope, they're in my fucking name and they're 40+ days past due. 

Minimum payments are $500 for one loan and $200 for another. I owe $1800~ currently after late fees and I'll continue to owe $700 a month. **That's more than my fucking rent.** 

I have the smaller loan caught up for the month, but I owe $900 on the other loan and I literally can't fucking pay. I called them and explained the situation and they said there's nothing they can do about it. No forbearance or deferment, no way to adjust my payment temporarily.

My parents are broker than I am so they can't pay. 

I make around $1200 a month. Rent $625, electric $100, internet/phone $100. $200 a month toward my federal student loans. The rest is food for two people and pets. 

I don't know what to fucking do. My parents are going to lose their house if I don't fix this. I cannot move back in with my parents to save money. I could conceivably move in with my fiance's parents but not until May.

Mr or Mrs &lt;STATE/FEDERAL OFFICIAL&gt;,

I work in &lt;INSERT LOCATION/OR JOB PROVIDER&gt; as &lt;INSERT JOB&gt;. I live in &lt;INSERT COUNTY/CITY/OR/STATE&gt;. I am the only support we have for our &lt;INSERT COOL JOB DESCRIPTION&gt; In essence I'm saying that I support many mission critical services. I rely on my home internet connection to be fast and reliable to support voice, emails and VPN to provide the support I need to for my job.

Broadband is a basic human right. The ability to learn online is phenomenal. Did you know you can get every M.I.T. course online, and for free? Imagine if every student in &lt;INSERT STATE&gt; could study at MIT for free? http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm . They can. While they won't earn a degree, the knowledge is available, and it's free. All they need is an internet connection. This is just a small example of what people can learn and do online. It's the largest repository of human knowledge that has ever existed. Every greek classic is available, for free. Every victorian classic is available, for free, every piece of music older than 75 years produced in the US is free, every book older than 75 years is free. What would you have done with this information and knowledge 30 years ago? I know I would be in a very different position if this was available to me back in 1990.

Many, if not most people in &lt;INSERT STATE&gt; live in an area where they can only get internet access through their local cable provider. A large portion of &lt;INSERT STATE&gt; is only served by a single, or at most 2 internet service providers, thereby establishing monopolies in those communities. Yes, there are alternatives to cable for internet connection, but they are limited by old technology. The largest competitor is DSL which relies on decades old copper connections to homes (the old telephone service) which limits them in many ways. If I was to switch to DSL I'd see a 10th of the speed I currently have, and I'd be relying on copper wiring strung 30, 40 or even 50 years ago. There is a limit on 50 year old wires.

We need to ensure that internet access is kept at an affordable price, and is available to all citizens of &lt;INSERT STATE&gt; and the US. The first logical step is to allow the FCC to classify broadband as a 'common carrier' allow smaller companies and startups to compete in a market dominated by the giants. To ensure that it isn't priced out of the range of many households in our State and Country.

While this issue isn't limited to just internet access, establishing rules for internet access is a first step. It's effecting cable TV as well. For cable I only have one option - &lt;INSERT CABLE PROVIDER&gt;. While my local &lt;ALTERNATIVE PROVIDER&gt; does offer cable television, they are sorely limited in the amount of purchasing power &amp; leverage they can apply to media providers, thereby limiting their options in what they can offer. They can't afford to offer HD television or a large selection of channels. While I'd love to support them to get a better selection, the economics dictates they will never have the capital or leverage to get these channels at an affordable price. However cable tv, as an entertainment service has a much lower priority in my opinion vs broadband.

My mom works as a nurse and makes $1,900 from her hospital every two weeks. In addition to that, she earns $350 a night working agency across town. She usually does this about once a week. My dad is unemployed but makes about $1000 from his social security check. They also live with my aunt, who makes $900 in social security. She works as a substitute teacher making about $300 dollars a week.

**Expenses** 

* Rent: $1800
* Electricity: $300
* Cable/Internet: $108
* Life Insurance: $73
* Auto insurance: $110
* Car Payment: I don't know this one because they just bought a new car not too long ago after their old one was totaled. I'm going to estimate this at $400 because their last car $400 a month (expensive, I know.)

I might be missing some more expenses but please let me know if you come up with any others.



**The Problem**

As of right now, my parents are sitting at -$1,100.00. Last night, it was -$970.00. Every single purchase they make with an overdrawn account costs them $35.00 in overdraft fees. It adds up tremendously. When I look at their bank activity, I am literally seeing consecutive overdraft fees one right after another. 

The other problem..... debt. My dad owes student loans. I don't know how much, but he owes them. Also, he owes money to the IRS. Long story short, they narrowly avoided jail-time for not paying their income tax. He writes $400 checks every month to the United States Treasury. One last thing... my dad frequently goes to the Cash Store and writes $350 checks. I'm pretty sure he owes money to them as well.



**My Plan**

**1.)** Plug up the massive negative balance that my parents have at the moment. To do this I will be using money from my own savings account. I'm going to deposit about 300 dollars more to give them some wiggle room. I feel that right now the most important thing is making sure that account doesn't fall into the negatives again, because those overdraft fees are like an interest rate of 300%.

**2.)** I'm going to close the account completely. Why? because I need to be able to keep track of every single payment going in and out of their bank. And right now, God only knows how many subscriptions and services they've signed up for. Making a new bank account (preferably with a credit union) will allow me to keep track and predict every single payment they make. It's essentially a way for them to start clean.

**3.)** Start setting them up for Auto Pay on the day after they get paid. This will ensure that they're always on-time with their bills and aren't left with cut power or cable or worse.... eviction.

**4.)** Get my dad to declare bankruptcy. This is the hardest part for me. I don't know where to begin on this and quite honestly, my dad is extremely resistant to the idea.

**5.)**?????

This is where I'm lost. i don't know what else needs to be accomplished. I was hoping you guys would be able to help me out on the next step.

Please let me know what you think. If you think certain things require a more in-depth explanation then please don't hesitate to ask. :)

My situation:

In this past year, I worked my job PT from 1/14-3/14 and then FT until the end of the year. I lived in one state from 1/14 - 11/14 and then moved and lived in another state for the month of 12/14. I work remotely and so my income is always earned in the state that I'm living in. Both states collect personal income tax.

My questions:

1. Is it possible to e-file taxes when I have to use PY (Part Year) Returns? Can you tell me from experience if Turbotax, Taxact, etc. have this built in to their systems? Online tax filing is my preference.
2. Is it possible that my PT status and withholdings from 1/14-3/14 (before I went FT) are going to somehow skew the amount that I owe in fed/state taxes? I'm concerned about owing more to them, as taxes in State2 are higher than in State1. Assume that my withholdings were set to provide a small-but-not-quite-zero refund in State1.
3. I've been using the IRS withholdings calculator and various income tax calculators and then dividing those gross numbers down to 11 months and 1 month and then cobbling together a figure to see what I would owe for each state. Is that an idiotic way to go about calculating my projected taxes?

personalfinance,Student loan refinance question,"Hello all... I've been a long time lurker, but created an account to ask a question regarding student loans.  I did a search, and people have asked similar questions, but the details of my situation are somewhat unique (primarily due to the amount of my debt.)  

Actually, the question is in regards to my and my wife's student debt.  We both graduated from medical school several years ago, and both have almost exactly $250,000 in debt (total of $500k.)  The bulk of our debt is at 6.5-7% interest.  

I am considering refinancing my debt (and likely my wife's as well), and although it isn't certain yet, I think I could get a variable interest rate of ~4.5-5.5% with refinancing (with potential for rate as low as 3.5%).  I also could get 5.75% fixed interest with refinancing if I decided to go that direction.  

With our current payment schedule, we should be able to pay off our loans (without refinancing) in 10 years or so.  With refinancing, we could probably shave a year or two off of that.  My question is this:  Is it too risky to refinance with a variable interest rate considering the magnitude of the debt, and the somewhat extended payback period?  Obviously, I could just refinance with the fixed rate of 5.75%, and that would save money considering most of our debt is at 6.5-6.8%, but it would be nice to get an even lower interest rate with the variable plan.  

We already have an emergency fund covering at least 3 months worth of expenses.  Our long term strategy is to pay off most of our higher interest debt before investing heavily for retirement.  Thanks in advance!",finance,1421296705

personalfinance,6 Key Types of Lazy Money and Some Tips on How You Can Get the Whip Out and Get it Working for You,"Is your money being lazy?

I speak to thousands of people every year about their finances and investment strategies and seldom do I find anyone who doesn't have lazy money lying around. Now what do I mean by lazy money? It is money in your life, which is not performing well for you or is just being wasted through inefficient systems or structures, and I see it all the time.

One of your keys to creating wealth is to get your lazy money and turn it into working money and that really means your money working for you, rather than you working for your money. Most people exchange their time for money by just turning up to work and getting paid for the number of physical hours they actually put in. This is why we love to invest, quality investments gets our money out there and working for us without us having to be actively doing something on a daily basis.

Here are 6 key types of lazy money I often see from property investors and some tips on how you can get the whip out and get it working for you, and working hard:

Tip 1	

Money in bank accounts.

Remember that lazy money is any money which is sitting somewhere but could be put to better use elsewhere. The number of people I find who just have money sitting in bank accounts earning them 0.5% or something like that is incredible. Why not have that cash sitting in your offset account at least where it is saving you interest which you would otherwise be paying. Better have your money in your backpocket than in the banks.

Tip 2
	
Untapped equity

When was the last time you reviewed your portfolio and the value of your assets? You might have some equity sitting in there, which could be put to better use by investing. This should be a standard practise for you every 6-12 months, just doing a check in with your portfolio; you can do this via your broker or ask your bank to get a valuation done.

Tip 3
	
Inefficient loan structures.

Do you know if you should pay principal and interest or interest only for your situation? Should you fix or keep your loan variable? Are you using your offset account effectively? Are you achieving the lowest interest rate possible while maintaining the flexibility you need? Do you have a debt reduction strategy for your home?

Honestly when was the last time you got an investment finance specialist review your portfolio? You should be doing this every 6 months and remember I said “a specialist in arranging finance for investors”, not just any broker or bank; there is a difference, believe me.

Tip 4
	
Negotiate everything.

Are you getting the best rate for your property management, for your insurances, for your health insurances, for your home utilities, for your interest rates from banks etc. etc. I bet if you looked around your home and reviewed and negotiated everything you might just take for granted as ‘what is’, you could find a lot of money you are just throwing away right now. I often see people come up with an additional $200-$2000 of extra cash in their lives every month, just by doing this.

Tip 5

Unclaimed Tax Deductions.

Although I will never advise anyone to invest purely for tax reasons (making a loss for the sake of making a loss and getting a deduction for it is madness), it can however be a handy benefit of a quality portfolio and a consideration when setting an investment strategy to minimize the amount of tax we pay. Many people look forward to receiving their yearly tax refund as a forced savings plan. Sounds good doesn't it? But it is so inefficient and such lazy money. Ask yourself while your money is sitting at the Tax Office waiting for you to claim it back once a year, how much interest are you earning from it? A big fat zero is right. Did you know you can potentially claim that money back into your pay packet on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis? That way you can get this lazy money working for you also.

Tip 6

Superannuation.

Now don’t even get me started on this. I won’t say much about the performance of the average superfund in Australia over the last 10 years, but let’s just say it has been quite pitiful. Is this better left in the hands of the major Superfund providers? Or do you think you could invest it in a better way and take much better care of your future? I will leave that question up to you to answer and of course I better put my disclaimer in: “This is not financial advice, make sure you seek the services of a qualified advisor”.

Don’t put up with lazy money in your life, it is the sure fire way to staying broke, whereas if you actively get your money working for you rather than you working your money, then financial freedom all of a sudden becomes closer and closer. Get that whip cracking!",finance,1421309940

&gt; Qualified education expenses.   For purposes of the 10% additional tax, these expenses are tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational institution. They also include expenses for special needs services incurred by or for special needs students in connection with their enrollment or attendance.
  In addition, if the student is at least a half-time student, room and board are qualified education expenses.
  The expense for room and board qualifies only to the extent that it is not more than the greater of the following two amounts.
The allowance for room and board, as determined by the eligible educational institution, that was included in the cost of attendance (for federal financial aid purposes) for a particular academic period and living arrangement of the student.

The actual amount charged if the student is residing in housing owned or operated by the eligible educational institution.

You will need to contact the eligible educational institution for qualified room and board costs.
Eligible educational institution.   An eligible educational institution is any college, university, vocational school, or other postsecondary educational institution eligible to participate in a student aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education. It includes virtually all accredited public, nonprofit, and proprietary (privately owned profit-making) postsecondary institutions.

I am a 23 year old student in debt. Can't say how much my debt is right now and won't know until monday, but i estimate it somewhere around 25.000-35.000 SEK(could be slightly more or slightly less, i really don't know). I have no income, but i just started studying so from this month my monthly income is 2828 SEK that i get in student aid. I live with my parents, and don't really have any expenses, exept for bus pass so i can ride to school, which is 835 SEK/month, and 100 SEK/month for phone refills.


I recently started studying and the interest rate for the loan they're offering is 1% in 2015. 


I was wondering if i should consider taking that loan. If i do, i would be loaning 7120 SEK/month, and also getting an additional 2828 SEK in student aid, which never has to be paid back. A lot of people i've met are saying this is the best loan you can get anywhere in Sweden. The repayment is very negotiable aswell, my girlfriend is paying 500 SEK every three months, so i feel that it's a pretty safe loan and i won't get myself into another debt. 


Since this is my only form of income, i have no other real chance to pay my debt off until i get a job, which is pretty unlikely at this time.

personalfinance,Poor students just got a bit less-poor: Where would you put an unexpected lump-sum of money?,"I've been following PF for months now, and would love some advice. 

My husband and I are both professional students nearing the end of our training. That means we have a LOT of debt, are making ends meet month to month, but with no surplus (yet) to pay off the debt. 

We just got some good news that we will be getting a nice large sum of money (around $8K). This is from a side project that has fortuitously panned out; it is in addition to our usual monthly income. 

We're debating on where to put this money. Here are the options: 

Mortgage: We have a $176K mortgage on a ~$270K house. Interest rate = 3.29% 
Line of Credit #1: $190K, at 3.0% interest 
Line of Credit #2: $43K, at 3.61% interest 

We are planning on moving in several years (like 3 to 4), to hopefully our ""forever home"". We will also be buying a car this summer. 

My husband wants to either put the money in the mortgage to pay it off more. His argument is that 100% of that money would be going to principle, and that when we move, we can use the equity in our house towards the principle, and excess to pay off any remaining line of credit debt we have. 

His second idea is to keep it in a savings account and buy a car outright with that money. I think that's particularly stupid, because we would make a pitiful amount of money on the interest in our savings account. 

I think it makes much more sense to put it to the line of credit, namely LOC #2 since it has the highest interest rate. This just seems so logical that I can't come up with any downside to it. 

What are your thoughts, oh wise peeps of PF? Any good argument one way or another is appreciated.

Does it make sense to pay $5000 from my savings (I have a good bit of savings, just sitting there, doing nothing) into my mortgage, so that I can get a $20,000 HELOC?

The reason I am considering this, is that I'm really just thinking about the ""what if"" questions.  What if we need more than $15,000?  Since we'll have this HELOC for at least 3-10 years, what if we need $20,000 for an emergency instead of $15,000.

It seems to me that the $5,000 in my savings account, getting a very very low interest rate, is better served by going into my mortgage, and allowing me to leverage a larger HELOC.

Our lender is offering us two different 30 year loan products with 5% down - one with standard PMI at 3.625% interest and one with LPMI at 4.00% interest.  From my understanding, both of these rates are fairly low compared to trends over the past few years.  

Based on my calculations, this is basically a wash - over the first 5 years, the reduction in equity and additional interest payments on the LMPI loan is almost exactly equal to the amount of PMI I would pay on the lower interest rate loan (unsurprising).  Over 30 years, the LPMI loan becomes about 2% more expensive than the loan with the PMI.
  
The big difference as far as I can tell is that the LPMI loan nets a bit of extra liquidity on the front end of the loan in the form of lower payments (about 4.7% lower), and gets me a bit more in tax deductions from the higher interest payments early on.  
  
So here is my question - what is this extra liquidity and deductions actually worth to me?  If I immediately put the cash savings from the LMPI loan back into the mortgage, it would be an effective return of 4% on that cash, right?  Is there another angle I am missing here?  It seems to me that the bank has calculated the higher interest rate based on those payments covering the cost of the PMI that they will pay, but by my calculations, I would come out ahead of that number simply by putting the 4.7% difference back into the house as extra monthly payments.

Currently I have 3 savings accounts, two are with brick &amp; mortar local banks and have small chunks of my savings in them (call it an emergency fund if you want) because the interest rates are laughably bad but it's nice to know I have immediate access to that money at the bank if I need it.

It seems foolish to move any money to any other bank because no one comes close to Discover's rates and I'm making a respectable amount of interest by keeping my money there.

I am looking for one or two solid recommendations for other online banks where I could move some of my savings and get interest rates competitive with Discover's.

news,CAN REPUBLICANS SHAKE THE CURSE OF DAVID DUKE?,"Thursday, January 15th, 2014
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

CAN REPUBLICANS SHAKE THE CURSE OF DAVID DUKE?

Poor Congressman Steve Scalise. He should be on cloud nine having reached the pinnacle of political success by being elected majority whip in the Republican controlled congress.  But out of the blue, he is blindsided by a 28-year-old democratic blogger and law student who ties him to David Duke.  Scalise’s sin?  Accepting a speaking invitation 12 years ago when he was a state representative to a group (located in the district from where he was elected) that has close ties to David Duke.

A feeding frenzy developed with Democrats calling for his head (or at least his resignation), and conservative Republicans expressing outrage.  “Defense of this (last decade) racist action is disgusting and wrong,” bemoaned Sarah Palin.  Popular conservative syndicated talk show host Mark Levin lamented: “He's yet another example of what's wrong with the GOP and Washington. The American people are sick of it, and those who defend such awful establishment leadership are not doing either the GOP or the nation any favors. Scalise is another setback.”

David Duke, in a perverse way, must be smiling.  He’s back. In Duke’s world, it doesn’t matter what you say about him.  Just don’t ignore him.  He’s relevant again and part of the political discussion, good or bad.  To Duke, it doesn’t make any difference.

A number of Louisiana Republicans are walking on eggs in hopes of steering clear of this whole conversation.  Duke has made it clear that he’s ready to kick ass and name names.  He was blunt in warning that those jumping all over Scalise for his Duke ties may pay a price.  “If any of them, if they jump on this bandwagon, those who have asked for support from my camp–if they throw Scalise to the wolves in this thing as part of this lynch mob, you know, I promise I will go and absolutely out them because they are hypocrites.”

Duke first launched on the political scene in 1987 when he won a surprising victory for a Louisiana House of Representatives seat formally held by present U.S. Senator David Vitter, and later won by Scalise.  Then, in an unexpected turn of events, Duke found himself in a run off with former Governor Edwin Edwards, a philosophical opposite of Duke.  In fact, Edwards would quip on the campaign trail that the only thing he and Duke had in common was that they both were wizards under the sheets. 

In the runoff, Duke was opposed by every political and civic persuasion around.  Republicans openly opposed his candidacy and espoused the popular bumper sticker, “Vote for the Crook (meaning Edwards), its important.”  The state’s largest newspaper, The Times Picayune, ran front-page editorials day after day bemoaning the disaster of a Duke victory.  In spite of this massive opposition, Duke carried 60% of the white vote.

So how could that be?  It came down to the message.  White voters were willing to forgive what Duke called “young man indiscretions” and embraced Duke’s platform.  And it’s the same platform Republicans in conservative districts across the country have embraced today.  Welfare reform, drug testing for food stamp recipients, the doing away with affirmative action program and quotas based on race, federal judges meddling in states rights, and major cutbacks in federal spending. 

 When Scalise told reporters that he was ”David Duke without the baggage,” it was a terrible choice of words, but he apparently was saying he agreed with Duke’s approach towards government policies.  And like it or not, a significant majority of white voters in Scalise’s congressional district, both now and 12 years ago, agree with both Duke and their current Congressman.

The problem Republicans have today is that they can control both Houses of Congress, but they cannot elect a president without “widening the tent.”  The GOP needs more Hispanics, African Americans and Asian voters to be successful on the national level.  

Scalise will survive his current stumble in the political road.  David Duke will again fade off the national scene.  The problem for the Republican leadership is to find a way to maintain their conservative values, while still addressing the rampant poverty and class differences throughout American today.  

Can they describe a road to economic opportunity that appeals to a growing number of minority groups across the country?  The GOP has its work cut out if they want to avoid the nation electing another Democratic president in 2016.

personalfinance,"(CA) Stable job, good income. Need some advice conquering debt.","Hi folks, 

Hope to get some good advice so I'll do my best to share the details of my financial situation.

I am a 24 year old male - I graduated with a degree this last April. My final student debt was 29,000 which, in the grand scheme of student debt, is not awful but enough to put some pressure on me. 

Between April and July, I struggled pretty hard to make ends meet while searching for a professional job in my field. I graduated with a pretty promising degree and good experience so I was confident there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Lo, in July, I found a job in the great north and moved to the Yukon. High wages but also VERY high living expenses up here. Living in that gap between school and job PLUS the move up here, I ended up having to get a credit card and dug myself into about 5K of credit card debt. 

Also - during my degree, my parents pressured me a bit into financing a new car as I did have the means to support it at the time. Presently, there is 14K left owing on my 2012 Chevy Cruze. 

To sum my financial this situation up:

**car payment**- 280/month

*part of my decision to go brand new was securing a 0% interest rate over 6 years - the car is estimated to be worth 13K by its kilometer count and age*

**student debt** - 410/month

*NSLC of Canada consolidation package offers a 5.5% floating interest rate*

**car insurance** - 180/month (long story)

**phone bill** - 80/month

**rent + utilities** (am looking to lower this presently, one bedrooms are EXPENSIVE) - 1300/month

**groceries + spending** - (everything is expensive in the north) - 850~/month

**Minimum payment on CC** - 180/month

*11.9% interest rate on CC, I believe*

In my new position, I clear around 3350/month (I believe my position is 50,000k~ a year pre-taxes salary) - so pretty good money for a first year post-grad. 

I should clarify too - I am not a frivolous person by any means. I have yet to make any friends here, so I mostly stay in and play video games, netflix or go to the gym (another expense haha). There aren't many malls or shopping centers so shopping isn't even on the menu most days. I feel in control of that aspect of my finances. Anyways.

I guess my question for the experts out there: I am making ends meet, but barely. Living paycheck to paycheck kind of deal. I feel like given my income, there may be a better way to manage my debt but I'm just not sure what's out there. Some sort of consolidation? I am very new to managing all this debt as it sort of all piled in at once. I am barely able to make the payments on credit card debt that is there and really wanting to clear all that out.

My big concern is that I'm an industrial mechanic and I have a lot of tools, which are currently covered by the place I'm working for but will no longer be once I'm off-site.  For those interested they include a CNC mill, cold saw, belt grinder, a plasma cutter, mig welder, tig welder, large lathe, tool chest full of a variety of hand, power and diagnostic tools.  I've begun a catalog of everything but if I had to buy them all over again, replacement cost would be somewhere around $70-80k, which dwarfs the cost of everything else we'll be moving out of our apartment (most of which I'd think could be replaced for &lt;$12k).  Most of the big expense will be moved on one flatbed trailer (that is mine) behind my friends duallie.  A lot of the rest will fit in an enclosed trailer (also mine) behind my pickup.  The rest will get stuffed in or on 2 cars (my wife's) and a seconds friends truck that is helping with the move.

A few potential problems I was thinking I'd want insurance against: theft (obviously) accident with uninsured/underinsured motorist, road condition accident or blowout causing an accident, acts of god (flood/lightning), equipment failure accident.  I'm sure I'm missing some here but those were a few that sprung to mind.

Needless to say I've spent a lot of time and money acquiring what I own and don't want to lose it all due to circumstances beyond my control.

I'm hoping someone here has done such a thing and can give me some advise who I should investigate, what I should be asking, what this type of insurance would even be called so I don't sound like a moron when I call/shop around.

personalfinance,Does paying off student loans negatively affect credit score?,"I have significant Student loan debt, so I am nowhere near paying any of them off. I pay the minimums on my dept of Ed and Federal loans. I take any additional money I have budgeted for payments and apply them to the highest interest rate student loan. 

I have also thought about paying off the smallest debts with the extra payments. Generally looking at my entire loan set, the smallest loans have the lowest interest rate. This would effectively close accounts as fast as possible, but cost extra in increased interest. 

This quote from a recent post made me question my strategy for paying them down.

""I had close to 30 different student loans and when paying off each one it impacts my score negatively.""

Does it impact negatively because average age of accounts diminishes? Does ""average length of credit history"" diminish for a paid in full account?

To optimize my credit at the end of this:

Would it be better to pay them down to very little, less than 100 bucks, then pay them all of at the end? The advantages to this would be that I have extensive credit history length, and can buy a house with great credit, then pay off the minuscule debts that may reduce my credit score.

Or should I try to close the smallest accounts as soon as possible?

Edit: No one is answering the question I want answered. Is there ANY truth to this statement: ""I had close to 30 different student loans and when paying off each one it impacts my score negatively.""",finance,1421354952

investing,Using the Calendar and Catalysts to Your Trading Advantage,"One of the biggest things that I look for when examining a new position, be it for my investment newsletter PowerTrend Profits or for The Thematic Growth Portfolio that I manage for Fabian Wealth Strategies, I’m always looking for catalysts. These are the events, meetings or product launches that can be real tipping points for a company and its shares. In fact, laying out a calendar of what’s ahead over the coming months and what kind of news is likely to emerge is one of the first things I do once an investment candidate passes my multi-layered screening process.

Let me share with you an example of one such catalyst that just passed.

Last week there was much discussion regarding on-again concerns about Greece, the dollar and monetary policy, but the Internet and the blogosphere have been simply humming with the “latest and greatest“ announcements coming out of the 2015 Consumer Electronic Show (CES). This show happens every year, and if you’ve never been before, to say it is an extravaganza would be an understatement. Against the backdrop of Las Vegas, corporate briefings and parties and the near-nonstop wave of press releases, it can be like drinking from the fire hose.

What you have to remember is despite all the glitz, at its core the show is a giant preview of what’s to come later this year — in some cases even further out.

Much like movie previews, some companies have some really cool things, others show all that they have and leave that empty feeling after, while yet others simply make you go “huh?”

From an investor’s perspective, it’s always good to see the direction in which consumer electronics and the key ingredients — semiconductors, displays, sensors and so on — are headed. Just remember not to fall into the hype of what’s being announced, particularly if it is being touted as the best thing since sliced bread from a company that most have never heard of.

Pulling the lens back a bit, for a conference that used to focus so much on the latest, greatest, thinnest and most powerful laptops and smartphones, there was far more talk about cars, the home, wearables, drones, speakers and more.

For example, Ford (F) CEO Mark Fields stated that he expects to see self-driving cars on our nation’s roads by the end of the decade. Adding some potential credence to this statement, Dieter Zetsche, the head of Mercedes-Benz cars and chairman of Daimler AG (DDAIY), focused most of his CES keynote address on unveiling a fully autonomous prototype vehicle.

Now, according to consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co., the average car already holds $350 or so in semiconductor content, with roughly $600 in a hybrid electric car and about $1,000 in a high-end luxury vehicle.

But let’s think more about this and the notion of the driverless car. In order for that to happen, a number of new systems need to be working inside the car or truck. It means innovations like tires embedded with microelectromechanical systems that monitor road traction and adjust braking, enhanced night vision and mapping, among other things. In other words, more sensors and more semiconductors will be making their way into cars.

Underneath the hood, it means there will be a spike in the amount of data sensed, processed and collected by these electronic brains on wheels. That will drive demand for companies like Freescale (FSL), Texas Instruments (TXN) and ARM Holdings (ARMH) during the coming years.

Connectivity, particularly mobile connectivity, is right up Qualcomm’s (QCOM) alley, and I see the soon-to-be-closed acquisition of Bluetooth company CSR (CSRE) as bolstering Qualcomm’s long-term position in this arena. Near-term, Wall Street keeps upping its December quarter shipment expectations for Apple’s iPhone, which now stand at 69 million units — up double-digit percentages year over year! That’s great for Qualcomm’s chip and licensing business and great for QCOM shares as these other aspects of the Connected Home, Connected Car and the Internet of Things begin to take off.",finance,1421356684

Currently I have: 

$1,500 Debt on one card (19% APR)

$2,750 Debt on one card (19% APR)

$1,250 Debt on one card (0% APR)

$350 Debt on one card (9% APR)

First off, I am well aware this is a shitty little portion of debt hanging over me. I am currently not working, as I had to take a little time tending to family issues lately. If all goes well, I should be working again by March at the latest. In the meantime, what would be the best course of action to spend $1,500, once my rebate comes in?

I would assume paying off the $350 card (and possibly canceling it?) would be best first and foremost. Would it just be wise to use the remainder and pay off what I could on the first card (due to it being to lowest in amount and highest in APR)? Most likely this is a pretty stupid question, as this is probably the most obvious move to make (Pay off higher interest rates first, duh!). Just wanted to get PF's opinion though since, as you can clearly see, I have not been so wise with my money in the past.

personalfinance,Refinancing our home,"Long time lurker here, first time posting...I wanted to get some advice on a home refi my wife and I are considering.
A little background:
We originally purchased a home back in 2004 in sourthern California and as was common back then, we got a horrible loan.  It was an interest-only 5 year ARM (I know, I know...).  We were young and dumb and thought we could afford a 500K house on our $60K combined yearly salary.  Anyways, we went thru with the loan and got the house.  4.75 years later and the housing market (and economy as a whole) was a huge mess and our 5 years with a fixed payment was coming to an end.  Our home was worth significantly less than when we bought it and we couldn't refinance...our monthly payment was going to increase over $1,000.  Since our original loan was interest-only, we weren't paying any of the principal.  There were a whole slew of other things going on at the time that I won't get into b/c it would be too wordy but at the end of the day, we ended up walking away from the house and letting it go into foreclosure.  That was 2009.  We spoke to our lender at that time who advised us that at the very minimum, we would have to wait 3 years before we could buy another home.  So, we worked hard at getting our credit back up over those 3 years and saved for a down payment.  In 2012 we were able to purchase a home again.  Rates were really low at that time and we made sure that we went with the standard 30-year fixed.  We got 3.375 interest rate and purchased the home for $432K.  Now, I know PF is going to freak out about this but we didn't have the full 20% down so we are currently paying PMI on our loan.  All of our taxes / insurance are impounded monthly along with our payment.  

We are both mid-30s and this home is where we plan to stay until we retire.  Of course things could change but we both have stable jobs (I work in software development and my wife is an RN) and we love our neighborhood and kids school, etc..  We plan to make this our forever home.

We currently pay $2,840 per month for everything which includes about $420 per month in PMI.  I just printed out a monthly mortgage statement and here is the breakdown in case anyone is interested:

* Principal - $740
* Interest - $1,134
* Escrow - $966 (this includes the $420 PMI payment)

Over the past 2.5 years, we have paid mostly the minimum payment...a few months here or there, I would throw an additional couple hundred dollars toward principal but since our interest rate is so low, I'm not too worried about it.  The housing market in So Cal has been slowly recovering and I heard that rates had recently dropped so I contacted our mortgage broker about a refi to see if we could get to that magical 80% loan to value.  He assured us that our home can now appraise at 515K so we could go through with the refi.  But, I really didn't want to start over again at 30 years so I asked him about a 15 year fixed loan.  With rates so low and getting rid of our PMI, I thought we might be able to swing it but turns out the payment on a 15 year was just too high.  We could definitely do it but we'd probably be house poor.  I voiced my concerns about starting over at 30 years and he offered me a 25 year fixed loan which I didn't even realize existed.  Here are the new terms of the refi if we go through with it:

* 25 year fixed (we will knock 2.5 years off the total life of the loan since we are currently sitting at about 27.5 years left on our original 30 year fixed loan)
* 3.5% interest rate (it's slightly higher than what we have now)
* New monthly payment will be $2,630 ($210 less than what we pay now)

I ran some basic numbers and I figured that if we keep our current loan, we have another 5 - 6 years or so paying PMI before FHA will just drop it for us.  So, taking 5 years (60 months) x 2840 = $170,400.  Then, our new payment would be approx. $2,420 with no PMI.  We will have another 22.5 years paying this amount.  22.5 x 12 = 270.  270 x 2,420 = $653,400.

I hope I math'd correctly.

653,400 + $170,400 = $823,800 (this is my estimated total out of pocket if we keep our current loan and stay in the house until it's paid off).

If we do the refi:
25 (years) x 12 (months) = 300

300 X 2,630 (new payment) = $789,000 (this is my estimated total out of pocket if we do the refi and stay in the house until it's paid off).

I hope I included all the relevant info.  My question is, would you do the refi?  It seems to make perfect sense on paper.  The interest rate is slightly higher but if all the other markers (monthly payment, total our of pocket over life of loan, etc.) are lower, I think it's smart.  Yes there will be closing costs but he's giving us a pretty good deal on the new loan.  

Since I don't have the best history in making sound financial decisions, especially related to home buying, I'd like to know what PF thinks.  What would you do in my scenario?  I just want to make sure I'm not forgetting something before going through with this...

First, I apologize if this isn't the correct place to ask this, second, hopefully I've included all the necessary information, I will also x-post to a solar subreddit, and third, thanks in advance for any help!

I am currently seriously researching a solar panel installation on my personal home.  I've been given several rough estimates and am now wondering about how this will effect my tax status.  Through the rest of this year (2015) the federal tax credit of 30% remains in effect, but looks to expire in 2016.  By the installers rough estimate I'd be looking at a tax *credit* of about $8,100 dollars.  We have a mortgage, and one child.  We've been paying extra on the house and have paid it down far enough that our interest deduction isn't amounting to very much any more.  I haven't finalized our taxes for 2014 but so far it's looking like were going to come out pretty close to zero as far as owe/refund.  My question is, if it looks like I might be due for a $8000ish credit for the solar panels, is it/why isn't it, a good idea to tax 8 or 10 personal exemptions on my W2 for the  year of 2015?  I could take the extra 300 or 400 dollars I would get on my check every two weeks and stick it in savings, collect to tax credit, and then just pay whatever I might owe correct?

investing,Why i think cramer is wrong to be so bullish on the US,"stems from him talking his mouth off in front of multiple screens saying ""why we're #1""

- ultimately what shows a fundamental improvement in the US economy is people buying more stuff which is a function of them earning more. However, hourly wages have gone up sub 1% each month in the last year, which is in-line with the pace since the recovery began in 2009

- people talk about unemployment but a. a lot is low wage creating and b. a lot comes from people dropping out of the labor market

- if the fed bought the argument that the US is doing well, they would raise rates. However, a. the fed looks at hourly wages and b. with a stronger USD, there's a greater chance of deflation which makes rate hikes a lower probability event

I will be required to make 9 monthly payments of $440. $40 each month will go toward the credit counseling company and I am asking for discussion surrounding whether this is a good idea or not.

Specific questions:

1. I can also put my credit cards (doesn't have to be every account) on the DMP which will reduce them to $130 instead of $200 and drop the interest rates to around 2% BUT the accounts will be considered closed. **Should I also include my cards on the DMP or simply make the minimum payments until I pay off the loans and then apply the $440 to my CC debt?**

So first off Im new to Reddit, I searched through some car loan posts and browsed the AUTO flair but couldnt really find anything similar to what im asking...so...im asking!


So heres the deal..About 2 years ago I bought my dream car, a 2010 Dodge Challenger R/T. Interest rate was about 9% and I believe what I paid was about $33k...although I couldn't find that info anywhere. I had no experience buying a car, and lived alone at 23, and had no one to help me...I was also making very decent money back then (more than my entire family's income combined) from a software company I had started so I didnt really care, I just wanted the car. Payments came out to $580/month.


Since then things have changed drastically...my income source stopped coming in about a year ago, I hit some hard times...although I managed to pay on the car every single month except 1 month, ( I was a month late form literally choosing to eat over pay my car bill). I had used my 2 extensions already, so they wouldn't allow a third.


They dropped a rating on my credit, and along with that, my student loan people made a mistake and did not apply the forbearance after telling me they had, so I get hit with 80 some late payments on my credit (apparently I had 80 small loans and not 1 large loan?) and I go from high 600s to low 500s overnight. I'm still working with them to get that resolved but its a nightmare.


As of now, I owe $21,722.81. KBB.com says its worth between $20k and $23k...So I owe just about as much as the car is worth.


Im in a different place now. I no longer need the car to validate my self, and honestly I miss my 1986 Iroc camaro that I paid $1k for, although I do like the reliability of the challenger (when everybody knows you by name at autozone, its time to upgrade). I am going backpacking around the world starting in May, living off of income I generate monthly online. Its not much, but it covers everything it costs to live in Los Angeles, so I figure it will cover everything it costs to exist in a country that costs much less than the US. So with that being said, I wont need the car in May, and I would hate for it to just sit somewhere while I keep making payments, plus that extra $580 every month would help my trip a lot.


I have 4 questions:

1) Are there any options for quick sales to dealerships? Is there any potential for a dealership to buy back the car without buying a new car?

2) Can I sell the car to a private party even though I owe on the car? How hard is it to get someone to buy a $20k car outright? Are there any options there?

3) Will a dealership or somewhere like Carmax trade a $20k challenger for say, a $6k GTO and pay off my loan? Even with bad credit? (wouldnt mind doing this and paying a smaller payment).

EDIT:
4) Can I have someone give me $x up front and take over payments? Is that legal/practical?

personalfinance,Unique Problem for Student Loans HELP!!! Please :),"Hi reddit! I, like so many recent graduates, have started paying off my loans. I've taken a look at unbury me to get a glimpse at how long it would take to pay them all off and I've also done some math of my own. I know about the snowball vs avalanche approach, (paying of the small amounts first vs. paying off high interest loans first). But, I think I'm in a unique situation. Here is a summary of the loans I have:



        Principle            interest rate       daily interest accrued           monthly payment 

A:    $3,482.17                4.5%                         $0.429                                    $36.37

C:    $10,035.57              3.4%                         $0.934                                    $99.54

E:    $5,576.48                3.86%                       $0.589                                    $56.53

F:    $2,066.17                3.86%                       $0.218                                    $20.95



Perkins loan

        $1,800                      5%                           $0.246                                       $40  


So far I have been taking the avalanche approach (I've been paying about $1,500 a month extra to my loans and have payed off 2 groups that aren't shown above in full). But as you can see, even though my Perkins loan has the highest interest rate, I'm actually accruing more interest (i.e. I'll end up paying more) from my lowest interest rate loan (group C) because the principle of group C is so high. I assume from here that I should tackle my loans based on how much interest is actually accrued instead of the interest rate (pay off the highest interest accrued loan first rather than the highest interest rate loan first). The reason why I'm posting is to make sure that I've done my math right and there isn't anything weird that I'm missing. Should I be taking this approach? Is there something better?

personalfinance,How should my wife and I handle this?,"Hey guys, 

Just now subscribed. Looking for some advice. 

My wife and I recently both got decently paying jobs. We (mainly I) have some debt. 

We just bought a car for 13k at a 15% interest rate. 
I have four student loans totaling 11k. I'm in school so they're deferred for now. 
We both have credit cards. Mine has $450 on it and hers $275. 

With our jobs, I make 330 every week after taxes, insurance and FSAs, and 10% retirement. She is in the process of switching jobs which will bump up her hourly pay from 10.50 to 14.50. She works three 12s, so I figure she'll take home around ~70% of her check, and will make about 700 every two weeks at the least. 

Our total bills add up to ~1300 a month. We spend around $150 a month on gas because we share a vehicle. We have a child, but thankfully get wic that covers all but a little for what he eats. We may have to spend $100 a month for diapers, wipes, and formula and baby food. 

How can we manage our money better? Right now we eat out fairly often, maybe half of the week. Mostly on the three days she works because she's so tired we just stop and get something on the way home. 

I made a spreadsheet but we never really stick to it. Maybe if I hear some stuff from other people it'll help kick us into gear

I am also trying to think about what I want my living situation to be next year. Currently, I live in a studio apartment but I think maybe buying a condo or real estate might be smart while interest rates are still low.

Long term: I'd eventually like to buy an airplane, as flying is a passion of mine. I do already have a pilot certificate and instrument rating though I don't fly regularly right now. I rent maybe once or twice a year the last 5 years. I'd imagine this would cost ~$100k. I'm thinking pretty far out on this though... It'd be years before I realistically began to pursue this but I'd like to try and prepare for it if possible.

Currently:  
 * Taxable Investment Account: $29,000 (~22k in stock, ~7k cash)  
 * Roth 401k: $17,500 (50% FID Money Market, 30% Vanguard Inst. Index, 10% SPTN INTL INDEX ADV, 10% INVS DEVLP MKTS R5)  
 * Savings Account: $5,000  
 * Checking Account: $1,500  
 * No debt

Income:
* $80k/yr gross

Expenses:  
 
 * $880/mo rent (Least starts/end Aug 1)  
 * ~$90/mo utilities  
 * ~$100/mo weed  
 * ~$350/mo food/restaurants  
 * ~$35/mo gas  
 * ~$100/mo health&amp;amp;amp;dental insurance ($0 deductible)  
 * I am contributing 50% of gross to 401k until maxed out in July

Credit Card:

 * Chase Freedom ($800 limit)

I travel ~1/month for work and get reimbursed for hotel/meals/other expenses. I typically have to pay off the credit card part way through the month to not go over.
I want to apply for the Chase Sapphire eventually as well.

I also am accumulating airline and hotel points.

Car:
Currently I am driving a relative's car as he is living out of the country. I am paying for insurance only, but I don't know exactly how much that is yet because it is through my parent's account. This also means I'll likely have to buy a car in the future.

Cellular:
Parents pay for it under their account for now until I need a new cell phone.

* Vanguard Institutional Index Fund - 0.04 - VINIX
* Westwood SMidCap Fund Institutional - 0.96 - WHGMX

So far My mix is as follows:

* Emerging Markets - 20% (mix of emerging bonds/stocks).  I may reduce this and add to something else due to high expense ratio but I'm unsure.
* EuroPacific Growth - 30%
* Vanguard Institutional - 20%
* Small Cap Value - 10%
* Large Cap Value - 10%
* Core Bond - 10% (Seems to be a bit more high-yield oriented than I'd like for my bond holdings.)

I chose this mix because I wanted to include roughly a 50/50 split between US and International stocks, and I was also aiming for a 90/10 stock bond split.

2. If I max out my Roth TSP can I continue to contribute to the traditional TSP and still have 5% matching by my employer?
3. Does the Roth TSP contribute to my yearly maximum contribution ($5500) to a Roth IRA or are the two unrelated?
4. If the Roth TSP and Roth IRA are different, which is more important to contribute to? Which one typically has a higher Return on Investment (ROI)?

personalfinance,Refinancing home after paying PMI Vs Waiting to save 20% downpayment.,"Hi, 
My husband and I were thinking of buying a house in Boston area for about 395K with 10% down payment (the lender said our PMI will be around $255 per month so it will be $3,060 per year). The price of the houses in Jamaica Plain area has increased by 3.6% since last year and the trend seems  to be increase . We are good at saving but I want to jump in the opportunity to take advantage of lower interest rate.
Here is the data by ""Consumer Finance Protection Bureau"".
http://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/check-rates/
We have two option.
1.)Buy a house right now with 10% downpayment and pay $255 PMI. We will refinance in 2 years to pay as much as 25% of the loan amount.
2.) Or  we could wait for a year or so and put 20% down payment ( assuming the rate of the increase in price of the house the cost of similar house will be $410,000 or maybe more who knows) but the risk is the interest rate might go up as well. 

P.S. We don’t qualify for “Mass Housing Program”

personalfinance,Buying Call Option to Fund 2015 &amp; 2016 IRA,"I am going to fund my IRA to the maximum amount every year forward. I split my contributions between traditional and ROTH up to the the deductible portion of the tIRA as I am squarely in the 25% bracket and therefore do not have the ability to contribute 100% to either at the beginning of the year. Additionally, I value the liquidity highly.

I was thinking, I could purchase 3 ATM S&amp;P 500 Call-Options for March 16 (about the time I would fund my 2015 IRA), Jan 17 (to fund my 2016 IRA). I would hold these in a taxable brokerage account up to about the time of expiration. At or near expiration, I would sell and use the proceeds to fund my IRA and subsequently purchase VTI in my IRA.

My thought is that I will have exposure to the market, at my current AA, at a value equal to my IRA as I accumulate the funds to purchase shares April XX in my IRA. If the price falls below the strike, I will loose the premium I paid. However, as this is a cash-settled equity index, I will receive favorable tax treatment (1256 contract) and I get to purchase the shares at their new lower price. OTOH, if the price rises between today and when I fund my IRA in 2016 and beyond, I can purchase at today's price less the premium paid.

I believe the market is extremely efficient and I am not trying to outsmart it. What I am attempting to accomplish is to increase my TIME IN THE MARKET while I accumulate the funds to fund my IRA in future years.

Ultimately the transaction would look like the following:

The March 2016 S&amp;P mini option with a 200 strike price is priced for 10 shares @ 5.8. I would purchase 3 call options which has a notional value of about $6000 (3x10x$200). The price I pay today to purchase 30 shares of the SPY in March 2016 would be ~$174.

The Jan 2017 S&amp;P mini option with a 200 strike price is priced for 10 shares @ 19.93. I would purchase 3 call options which has a notional value of about $6000 (3x10x$200). The price I pay today to purchase 30 shares of the SPY in March 2016 would be ~$598.

The total premium paid would be $772.

personalfinance,Should we refinance?,"Current Loan:

* 30-year fixed, started paying in September, 2012
* Purchased the home for $432K (So. Cal) and only put the FHA required 3.5% down
* 3.375% interest rate
* Currently paying PMI (approx. $420 per month)
* Total monthly payment = $2,840 (Principal = $740, Interest = $1,134, Escrow = $966 (this includes the $420 PMI payment)

New Loan:

* 25 year fixed (we will knock 2.5 years off the total life of the loan since we are currently sitting at about 27.5 years left on our original 30 year fixed loan)
* 3.5% interest rate (it's slightly higher than what we have now)
* New monthly payment will be $2,630 ($210 less than what we pay now)
* No PMI (broker says our house will appraise for around $515K which will get us to the 80% loan-to-value

I ran some basic numbers and I figured that if we keep our current loan, we have another 5 - 6 years or so paying PMI before FHA will drop it for us. So, taking 5 years (60 months) x 2,840 = $170,400. Then, after PMI drops off, our new payment would be approx. $2,420.  We will have another 22.5 years paying this amount. 22.5 x 12 = 270. 270 x 2,420 = $653,400.

I hope I math'd correctly.

653,400 + $170,400 = $823,800 (this is our estimated total out of pocket if we keep our current loan and stay in the house until it's paid off).

If we do the refi: 25 (years) x 12 (months) = 300

300 X 2,630 (new payment) = $789,000 (this is my estimated total out of pocket if we do the refi and stay in the house until it's paid off).

We plan to stay in the house long term.  We are both mid 30s and love our home, the neighborhood, kids school, etc.  We both have stable jobs (I work in software development and my wife is an RN).  I hope I included all the relevant info. 

My question is, would you do the refi? It seems to make perfect sense on paper. The interest rate is slightly higher but if the other markers (monthly payment, total our of pocket over life of loan, etc.) are lower, I think it's smart. Yes there will be closing costs but he's giving us a pretty good deal on the new loan.

Since I don't have the best history in making sound financial decisions, especially related to home buying, I'd like to know what PF thinks. What would you do in my scenario? I just want to make sure I'm not forgetting something before going through with this...

So online banks like Ally let you open as many accounts as you want - I've seen lots of people say they like to have a separate account for each thing they're saving for (House, Vacation, Car, etc). If the interest rate for the savings account is the same (since they're all with the same bank), there's no downside to this, right?

now comes to sob story.... 
about 4 years ago i was in a pretty bad car accident, immobilized for the better part of a year surgeries, physical therapy, etc... had no health insurance at the time so medical bills racked up pretty quick. whatever savings i had went towards paying bills while i couldnt work.  my car insurance was no where near adequate and the other driver, who was at fault was financially worse off than i was. basically got told i could sue them but would never see a dime more than likely, as they already had several judgements against them, irs after them for taxes. So a lot of those medical bills are still haunting my credit report. 
It took a while to get back on my feet, get a little money back in the bank. 


Late 2013 my fiance got diagnosed with breast cancer and immediately was plunged into drs visits/tests/scans/chemo etc. her health insurance has been very good thankfully, but we still incur quite a bit of costs if just from her missing work to go to appts or co pays, supplies, prescriptions. this is still on going but we hope to be on the coming up to the end of the journey 

MY credit was still wrecked most recently by accident but i also threw it in the trash in my early 20s cars repo'd, house foreclosed, told CC companies to f off. i'm in my 30s now so most of that is no longer an issue on my credit report however. MY fiance has/had pretty much no credit. 
When I started job after accident it was pretty well known i would be driving a lot of miles 1000-1500/week (most of it paid for by employer). I responsibly was looking at small commuter cars, $10k range, was putting down about 3500 on it but interest rated were still outrageous(16% area) on a 2008 w/30k miles. So my dad offered to carry the note and I paid him for it (at 30 years old it is a little embarrassing) that car will be paid off this year in november. 
however no help to my credit scores, all i had was a single secured credit card i kept the balance revolving on. so my scores were sub-600. 
after we got news of breast cancer we made the decision to get fiance a new car, as hers was about 15 years old and would have needed $1500-2000 of work for me to feel good about having her rely on it to get to/from appts when i was unable take her. 


I took out a pretty bad loan on a 2007 acura @ about 17%. with the plan to refinance it after a few months, that however did not happen... I inquired with a few whom i've heard work with troubled credit and was told owed to much on vehicle/ vehicle older than 7 years/ simply not approved. so i'm struck with it for now and i need to try and get the principal I owe on it down.I havent missed any payments, all have been on time, ive even made extra payments. however my credit scores just arent much better than they were, 620 range. 


is my best course of action just to pay down the loan as fast a possible? until i can take out a personal loan which may be another year  minimum? 


lender will not refinance in house


trade it in on something else now (which i'll will have to carry over underwater amount~5k) possibly end up with better interest rate but owe as much if not more money.

I am contributing 5% pretax to my 401k (employer matches 4%).  In addition, we have another $5k or so per year to add to a retirement fund.  So here are my questions:

1. Given that my company's 401k options are limited, I will probably contribute to a traditional IRA.  Are there any disadvantages compared to a 401k that I'm not considering?

2. I realize this is asking for an opinion, so please share - How much should I prioritize saving for my kids' college versus my retirement?

3. I think the better course of action is to invest for retirement instead of pay down principle on our mortgage given the interest rate on our mortgage and the length of time until retirement.  Good idea or bad idea?

4. I feel like I'm shooting in the dark when trying to determine how much we will need for retirement.  Can someone point me in the direction of a retirement calculator that could help me out?

I do not carry any revolving balance on my credit card. I have a CapitalOne Quicksilver (used to be Platinum Elite). I put everything I can on it and get 1.5% back in cash. I don't think I've EVER paid interest on this card. My credit score is awesome. Last time I pulled the report I had 765/780 (for my last car loan). CreditKarma says it's gone up since there (used to say 730 and now says 750), so I MIGHT even bee near 800 now.

I have NEVER been over these budgets. They have plenty of wiggle room. Every bill is paid up one month in advance. I manage to invest about $500/mo in my private investments (I have a rule that every unnecessary expense is matched by a contribution to my personal investments. My new home theater receiver cost me $1000 because I put $500 in investments when I got the $500 receiver). My 401k is well funded, and I am part of my company's employee stock purchase program. I'm also a part of an employee retention program that gives stock awards to be paid out over time to valuable employees.

*About the STi: I owned a 2005 STi previously. I bought it for $21,000. Drove it for 50,000 miles and 3 years. Then I sold it for $19,500. The single largest expense associated with this car was the poor condition the previous owner had left it in. This time around I bought a brand new one. I look at my STi as an investment. You can disagree, but I've had VERY good luck with this tactic. At a good interest rate (1.65%), I lose very little on this car apart from the initial drop in value off the lot (which is substantial, to be fair).*

*About the food: The crappy truth is that I don't cook during the work week. I leave for work around 7AM and I can usually get home by about 7PM. Between getting ready in the morning and sleeping, I burn about 8 hours. Twice a week I have 2-hour physical therapy sessions before work (hurt my knee hiking about 5 months ago; I'm doing all of the 4,000-footers in NH). Once a week I spend the night at the pub doing trivia with my dad and his friends. I'm in my home for about 10 hours between Monday and Friday. Weekends I do cook.*

I work in a very stable field and have an advanced degree and professional certifications. I earned about 87K last year, and will be earning about 120K this year. Most would say I'm pretty cheap/frugal overall and I live a pretty modest life, but I spend a good amount of money on experiences (travel, time with my gf, friends, etc.).



I have about 50K in checking/savings, and 50K in my 401k. At the moment I have about 40K in various student loans, with interest rates averaging about 6.5%. I have zero credit card debt, and I bought my used car with cash. I do most of the maintenance myself, and am pretty handy overall (probably because I'm cheap?). I contribute about 13% into my 401k (9% traditional/4% ROTH).



I may be moving to a different city within the next year, but only for 1-2 years. I would then return to my home city.



**My dilemma:**


I am debating between paying off my student loans (and increasing my 401k conributions) or purchasing some rental real estate (in my home city). 



My family has a lot of experience managing rental properties and rehabbing apartments, so I can leverage their experience and connections to make it easy to manage while I'm away. Ideally I would find a building with 3 rental units that needs some renovating (I know renovations would require cash - but I can probably fund as I go) but overall it should be livable as is. My target is somewhere in the 250-300K range.



Currently, I'm not getting any benefit on my taxes for paying the student loan interest since the deduction is fully phased out at my income level, so I want to pay them off, but doing so will leave me with a very limited amount of savings for a while. I probably wouldn't be able to purchase anything until about June/July time period, because my job is pretty hectic during this time of year. So, there is potential for me to pay off the loans now, build my savings back enough for a down payment on a property this summer. My monthly payments total about $750, so my cash flow would increase significantly with this option.

Obviously buying together pre-marriage is for fools so everything would be in his name only. I watch House Hunters and that's the extent of my home buying knowledge. He doesn't like HGTV.

I'm trying to get a handle on costs and would like opinions on what's glaringly a good or bad idea. Here's what I know: he met with a loan officer at our credit union and was verbally approved for ~$400K (which I laughed at because based on my House Hunters knowledge, the bank always tells you more than what you should spend).


We haven't gone through an official approval process yet, but I used to verify income for a large company so I understand the process can take quite a while with underwriters. Based on the timing, we probably won't be able to grab the condo we want but I figured now is a good time to gather knowledge. He's eligible for a physician loan, which requires 0 down payment and waives PMI, with an interest rate of 3.25%. Is that a good idea? We could put $10,000 if we had to if that's a better idea.


The condo we're interested in is $250K, in a zone where property taxes, city tax and state personal income tax are waived until 2018. The HOA fees are the building are $185/month. We currently pay $1400 for rent/utilities. *Edit: his income is $106K, and it's a place he could afford on his own without me.

personalfinance,"[Question] How bad is our situation, and did we mess up?","Hi Reddit.  I read through the FAQ but am still a bit confused on what to do here, and how deep we're in trouble.

My SO and I have recently combined finances.  We both have debt, so he took on my debt and I took on his.  We also decided that we were going back to school. (we both recently left the military)

What we were not prepared for was that school is expensive and takes a LOT of time, especially if you haven't been in school for quite a few years like us!  And - finding a job that can fit our schedule has been a nightmare.  So we're both unemployed at the moment.

The VA is paying for our education and a housing allowance per month that we're in school that covers our bills but not our expenses.  He has kids, so we also need to worry about being able to financially provide for them!  I'm worried that we are a bit in over our heads but I know we need college degrees to get jobs to be able to support the kids.

We took out $19,000 in student loans this month, because it is a much lower interest rate (4.66%) than some of our debt.

I guess I am looking for some hope, maybe some guidance on where to put our money...

Our budget per month:

* $2,350 in bills (we have cut back on these as much as possible! cheap phone plans, no cable, etc.) - is not including the two high-interest debt payments per month because they aren't due until May/Oct
*  $540 in expenses (food+gas+entertainment for kids+etc)
* No income (trying to find jobs)
* $2445 from VA during school months (not summer)

In our accounts:

* $21,500 in checking
* $3,250 in savings

Our debt:

* Personal loan - $6,900 at 17.75% next payment not due until Oct
* Car loan - $15,400 at 13.79% next payment not due until May
* Car loan - $9,650 at 2.9% next payment due next month
* Plus the student loans we took out that we don't really want to worry about too much right now. (or should we worry?)

What should be our plan, because I dont know where to begin -

personalfinance,"Why you should not transfer debt from an unsecured loan to a secured loan, even if it ""looks like it will save you money by lowering your APR"".","There is a recent post where a salesman gets a customer that has $5,000 for a down payment on a car, to not make the down payment, and instead take out a loan for the full amount (at 6.5% APR) &amp; use some of that $5,000 to pay off a $3,500 personal loan (at 24% APR). The car loan only goes up $100 per month while the personal loan was $200 per month. This appears to save him $100 per month. However, there are a few problems with this. 

First, the customer's total debt is now $1,500 more than it would have been if he had made his down payment. ""But the better APR is going to save him that money"" you might be saying to yourself.

Wrong. You see, the math shows that there was roughly 18 months left on the $3,500 personal loan, while the car loan probably has 3 to 5 years. That $100 dollar savings is NOT saving him anything. Let's look at both cases...

Keeping the personal loan -&gt; 18 months at $200 per month = $3,600

Transferring personal loan into car loan -&gt; 3 years at $100 per month = $3,600

They are the SAME amount. He didn't save anything by transferring his money. And unfortunately, the customer likely didn't get a 3 year loan. Suppose he got a 5 year loan. That's 2 more years of paying the extra $100 per month. In this case, he actually ends up paying $2,400 MORE by transferring the money to the new loan (even though it has a lower APR).

Not as good as you thought. But there's more. After 18 months, the guy's monthly debt payments would have been $200 less. But since he transferred the money, he still has to pay that extra $100 for another year or three. What if in that time, money becomes tight, and the guy can no longer pay that extra $100? It's simple. His car will get repossessed. So now, not only has he committed to pay more money, he is left without a car.

""You are assuming a very specific scenario that is not likely to happen."" Maybe. But any reputable personal finance education will teach you to never transfer unsecured debt to secured debt. It is flat out, a bad idea.

Take a debt-consolidating second mortgage for example. You have 20K in CC debt. If you can't pay that, what happens? Nothing really. However, if you transfer that money over to an equity loan on your home which lowers your interest rate, and then you can't pay? You lose your house. The risk just isn't worth it.

This post is already too long so I will leave it at that. I just wanted to write and hopefully spread some real ""Personal Finance"" knowledge after seeing the scary support that the other thread received. It really wasn't the good choice that everyone appears to think it was.

When the original acquisition of Veritas was made, many media outlets cried that it didn't really make sense to combine these 2 companies.  So now that we are essentially undoing it, this leaves me in a bit of a predicament.

As part of my benefits, we have an Employee Stock Purchasing Plan.  We can put up to 10% of each post-tax paycheck into the plan and each six months, a purchase of Symantec stock will be made at 15% below market price.  Most people turn around and sell their stock immediately for full price, which is what I was going to do, given I have $26k in student loans. 

I will have 2 6-month purchases before the split happens.  Word around the office is that Symantec's stock price has always suffered because of the merger, but could possibly rebound and be worth more afterwards.  Would it be beneficial to hold on to the stock through the split? Is it too much risk?  I'm tempted to just take my money and run as it would allow me to pay of a group of student loans that is at a higher interest rate.  

What if they offer me an equivalent purchase of the new company's stock, which should be public right away?  They haven't said how that will work for us yet, but I assume there will be something like that.

personalfinance,Father has offered to be investment guarantor for $100k. Should I take him up on it? (US/UK),"Hi PF! Sorry for the wall-of-text below; some backstory: My parents have always been exceedingly trustworthy and helpful with money. They both worked themselves out of being on the lower socio-economic rung growing up to being well-off, upper middle class adults. They never did anything suspect regarding me or my sibling's finances and general did quite well for themselves. They split up about 5 years ago, but both maintained a very good earning for their professions.

Unfortunately, my mother passed away last January, leaving me (27) and my siblings (among other things) as the benefactors on a TIAA-CREF retirement account, my share being worth around $117,000 at the time of her passing. This was in the state of GA that she lived and had all of these accounts (and where I'm from), but I had gotten married and moved out of the country to the UK about 7 months prior to that. As I have been incredibly busy with both work and life, I have yet to transfer ownership of the TIAA-CREF retirement account to my name (I know, I know), but will be doing so imminently. (side question: having formerly lived in GA, but now in the UK, does any one have any idea on what kind of tax burden I might have for the inherited money from the retirement? Be it federal, state, UK, or any at all?)

**Now** to the crux of the issue: I live in the UK with my wife and we are looking to purchase a home this year. The flat we live in now is co-owned by her and her sister, but we are looking to sell and purchase one for the two of us. Obviously, having as much money to make a deposit as possible is a good thing, especially in London where housing prices are ASTRONOMICAL and my father has decided to make my wife and I an offer. He has been investing for around 10-12 years and has done decently for himself. In order to assist me and my wife in having money for a mortgage, he is offering to guarantee the principle on $100,000 worth of investment for us. Basically, he would advise me on what/how to work my investments in the US market (all while in my accounts and under my power) and we would keep the money in until such time that a decent profit was made. If the investment were to continue below $100,000 for such a time that we believed it unsalvageable, or if (God forbid) we lost all of it, my father would guarantee and repay us on whatever was lost. Any profit made would be 100% mine and he isn't asking for any percentage from any gains.

My father's trustworthiness isn't in question. He has the money to back up the principle without ruining himself financially (although obviously nobody wants to lose $100k) and he has zero history of trying to rip off anyone in the family (or anyone else for that matter). But since I'm new to investing and don't have any experience with sums of money like this, I'd like to gather your advise on the subject. Is this a simple decision, either in the yes or no category? Or are there more complex things I should be weighing in before I decide to make a choice? Thanks for all/any of your help.

- $1,276 to pay off on my car with an interest rate of 4.125%. I use my direct deposit to put $100 of that per paycheck into paying that off, so it should be paid off in 4-6 months, depending if I put some loose coin in there.

- I have $5,513 to pay off on an American Express card. I can't seem to find the interest rate but it's similar to the Visa card (12%), if not lower.

- I have about $5,000 to pay off in student loans. The student loan website is down right now so I can't get the exact info but I believe the interest is around 6%

politics,"Giving Obama ""Fast Track Authority"" would be a disaster that could rapidly (among other things) lead to sudden huge irreversible jumps in heating and electricity bills that would likely kill jobs, and displace a unspeakably large number of families from rented apartments and homes in 2016.","Giving Obama ""Fast Track Authority"" would be a disaster that could rapidly (among many other things) lead to sudden huge irreversible jumps in heating and electricity bills that would kill jobs, and displace a unspeakably large number of families from both rental and owned homes. 

This is because the Obama Administration is foolishly pushing three huge trade deals wand one of them, TTIP, with the 38 EU countries contains this hidden huge gift to the energy industry, which has been selling stock like crazy based on the probably correct assumption that they could railroad the present administration into doing something extremely contrary to the public interest and embedding this change in the FTA in such a way that both it AND WTO rules will kick in making the change absolutely impossible to stop or reverse one initiated. Then most of that natural gas would not be sold to Europe, it would be sold to the highest bidders, leaving many Americans and Europeans to fend for themselves on the free market, but Europeans have much lower health care costs. And in many cases higher real wags when everything is taken into account. Also, fracking and drilling would be increased and the FTA would overrule innumerable local and national laws on environmental safety as well as  laws barring fracking. To make things worse, from the very beginning its been clear that the goal is alsio in part to reduce accountability and financial liability for things like drilling accidents- assuming they layered subcontractors in a way not just encouraged, which it seems to me will be virtually forced upon them by another FTA, TISA,  in the not too distant future. That FTA seems as if it is gearing up to attempt to privatize so much because it attempts to use jobs as bargaining chips in a global game that the people everywhere lose in. Instead of raising global standards and safety, it wil encourage a global race to the bottom on wages. Also, it will open the flood gates to perhaps even millions of new international subcontracting firms which will be required to be admitted with their employees to do jobs they have won bids on. (All government spending will also be sent through a new international procurement system modeled on the one already in use under other trade deals but vastly increased in scope.)  

These firms would service both private industry and especially governments. Services firms already operating internationally in areas like healthcare, prisons, health insurance and IT do not have good records, and clearly there is a lot of corruption and politically driven, intentional shoddy-ness, enabled by lack of accountability, nonetheless they are expanding and the FTAs will give them carte blanche to replace entire areas now considered public service and sacrosanct with intentional low quality and millions of good paying jobs with very low paying jobs often staffed internationally under payment arrangements which seems to me likely to make enforcing minimum wage laws in each country basically impossible. newly privatized areas such as education and in many countries energy.

So its vastly understating the scope to say that it does hundreds even of unwise things. Including lifting restrictions on the exporting of natural gas that have been the main protection against extreme increases in heating and electricity costs is one of the most stupid things. Unless one comes to the conclusion that they are waging some kind of war on Americans . Then its smart, just as keeping the North Korean military on the verge of starvation is wise for the North Korean government. 

Even though its hurting Americans tremendously to take each and every one of the dozens of quasi-hidden trade positions they do, they are doing it anyway. Each country is being brought into a system where the corporate interests are against the people on a global scale, so it can be said that anew global regime is being created that supersedes nation states whose goal is keeping the people poor despite growing abundance which could end poverty in the very near future. What a scary thought. 

These changes will also increase social stratification by putting a good non-privatized education into the realm of the no longer even possible, at least in countries which sign on to this entire new anti-public interest-pro corporation vendetta against sanity.

Natural gas costs several times (last I looked in late 2014 300% to 500% of what it costs here) overseas.

Now, natural gas and electricity costs in the USA are for the most part much much lower - in the case of natural gas literally a fraction of what they are everywhere else in the world. That's true. But, whenever anybody tries to point that fact out, its made impossible to explain by intentional obfuscation. Irregardless of the obfuscation The core and most important fact is ITS NOT AFFORDABLE OR ACCEPTABLE TO CHANGE IT NOW BECAUSE IT WOULD TRIGGER ANOTHER DISASTER FOR FAMILIES.  Its not a coincidence that both parties seem to be in on a big joke on the American people. that's how the FTAs set it up. And at this point none of them can really be trusted to act in the public interest rather they are trying to pretend they don't know this is happening in case it is exposed. Plausible Deniability.

These trade deals and the ISDS, ""indirect expropriation"" ""standstill"" and ""ratchet"" concepts driving this new ugliness of superior (to national laws and democracy and the global as well as national and local human public interest)  their corporate entitlements which are being pushed by the US and the EU and UK governments are solely ideologically and profit driven trade is in many ways just a pretext they use to drive the public interests out of the universe of things which can be considered, at all.

Its an entire ideology which they largely hide that is embedded in them, one which sees any government regulated affordability or any consideration of things like natural resources to be a public wealth as a form of theft from corporations. And of course, price controls of any kind violate that ideology.   In this value system, for example, drugs should be priced without any consideration whatsoever for the costs to make them, instead they should bring ""what the market will bear"" and they put in place a  *""criiminogenic""* regime that makes politicians into complicit liars and criminals who must lie and make promises that the FTAs prevent them from keeping (which also means lie about the FTAs) to stay in office. They also lie again and again about the results of these FTAs.. for example, numerous studies say TTIP will destroy a great many jobs. However, you will never read that in the media. 

The TTIP energy deal is being prepped to be inserted at the last moent or in the middle of the night on a holiday which is also when the fast track will suddenly be passed Do not trust any NGOS to do your calling and writing for you. This is much too important to trust to NGOS that may be embarrassed that they have not done their jobs up until now to warn us about these things. Oftentimes they don't see the big picture or are afraid to admit its as bad as it is. 

Why would millions of people lose their homes? Literally millions of Americans homes which are affordable now, would suddenly be deemed 'too expensive to heat'.  many landlords - and to some extent this is understandable- resent the governments dumping what they consider to be the governments problems in their laps by mandating ceilings on allowable rent increases. Rent stabilization laws are under attack and the fact that they are a price control means they do not fit into the new ideological definitions of what is permissible. Nor does new public housing. And as I am saying over and over again, ideology is always trumping the public interest and these new FTAs are systematically eliminating governments abilities even if future elections literally turn every single current politician and party out onto the streets, these supra- national structures will tie future government hands. THAT IS THEIR INTENT.  So please understand this Fast Track issue is the most important single political battle of the last several decades and our entire futures as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in money PER CAPITA that could go to people as in Americans and Europeans and Asians and Australians and Africans- or go to corporations leaving people in poverty, PER PERSON.",energy,1421521438
Bitcoin,Revolutions always take more time than you think,"I am sad to see the price of bitcoin decline for over a year already. Nevertheless, I feel lucky to have the privilege to witness a third technological revolution in my life so far. But why do they always go so slow? And the funny thing is, once they have unfolded, they seemed to have gone very fast. Let me elaborate on the other two revolutions.
 
When I was 17 years old, my school was keen to set up a ""personal computer programming class"". In the few years before, computers had become smaller and cheaper. So cheap, that someone could afford a very simple computer for his very own. Those became known as Personal Computers or PC. I enrolled into the class, curious as I was about technical stuff, and I didn't need much time to recognize the mind blowing potential these PCs could have. Half a year later, I decided not to go study astronomy, my then passion, but computer science instead. In retrospect, that was a good career choice, as 30 years later everybody is walking around with a PC in his pocket (nowadays called a smartphone).
 
The second revolution was the Internet. Note, actually there are two parts to this one, the actual Internet and its biggest killer application so far, the World Wide Web (WWW). When most people talk about the Internet, they actually mean the WWW. You could even argue they should be considered separately, but the Internet had the promise of the WWW already clearly embedded in it.
 
The first time I got to know the Internet was in the days of cold nuclear fusion in 1989 (remember that?). As a student I worked as an assistant, and in our break room cold fusion was a hot topic. There was one person who had access to ""the"" Internet, and he always had the latest news that mortals like me had to read in the newspaper two days later. One year later I started my PhD and got access to the Internet on a daily basis, complete with my own shiny email address. Now the revolution engulfed me. Those were the days of telnet, ftp, mail, archie, and Usenet. I will never forget searching for a certain file with archie (a search tool for files on other computers), to find the needed file on a computer in Australia. The pure extacy of entering that computer at the other side of our planet, and sending that file on the fly to my own computer was exhilarating. 
 
A few years later the first internet service provider (aptly called xs4all, they are still in business) started in the Netherlands. Now, you could access the Internet from home! I bought a modem, and now I could do everything from home that I could do at work. Like emailing. Some people had to laugh about that. Me, writing an email while connected by phone to Amsterdam. It wasn't cheap. It was fragile (if the connection dropped, my text was lost). Skeptics said, why not send a fax? Who has an email address? Why not simply call? And of course, they were right. But the Internet could do so much more in potential! It surely would get more practical and user-friendly, I thought. And it did.
 
In 1994 something new appeared. Mosaic, a program that allowed viewing of pages with texts and images that were on a different computer. This was the start of the World Wide Web, and in a matter of a few years many existing services like ftp, archie and Usenet would move to the WWW. It made the Internet truly user-friendly. This is gonna be big, I thought. I once put up my PC on a party for my friends to try the WWW. I got excited the very first time I saw a web address written on a truck. And I ended up working for a company that develops web-applications.
 
Late October 2013, I looked into Bitcoin seriously for the first time. I had heard about it one or two years before, but didn't pay attention. Now I did, and suddenly realized THIS is gonna be big. Why? The Internet has made information and software globally distributed and yet, instantly available. But one piece of the puzzle was still missing. Trust. If you exchange value with an anonymous party, you need a trusted third party in between. If you buy a book in your local bookstore, and pay with cash, no trust is needed. Because you swap the cash for the book there and then. But if you buy a book at Amazon, you need a third party that trusts both Amazon and you, so that Amazon and you don't need to trust each other. In this example, this third party is a credit card company.
 
It also works with other things, like property rights, for which both parties put trust in a notary (which is licensed by the government). Or for money itself. Money is basically a claim you have to future resources. We trust our Central Bank to make sure our money doesn't lose its value too fast. And the government trusts the Central Bank that it doesn't gain value. Because if it does, their debts increase in value, making it harder to pay them back. (That's the main reason for the scaremongering about possible deflation, BTW.)
 
And now there is Bitcoin, where there is no trust in one single entity. Instead, trust is distributed across the network. A truly revolutionary concept! And the strength of the Bitcoin network keeps growing. In 2014 it became no less than 40 times stronger. So while the price of bitcoin went down by two thirds, the Bitcoin network grew enormously. Remarkable how different groups of people, Bitcoin processors (aka 'miners') and speculators, can have such divergent expectations. Also the software developers have been working like crazy to improve Bitcoin applications, entrepreneurs are busy creating new Bitcoin services, and venture capitalists are pouring millions into startups.
 
The genie is out of the bottle, the revolution will run its course. And when its done, we'll all say how fast things change...",cryptocurrency,1421522322

I'm currently studying Psychology in the Netherlands, and I have a question about money I have on my savings account. This is al fairly new to me, and I don't know a lot about it so bear with me if I say stupid things.

I have a student loan, where I am €12000 in debt and I pay 0,12% interest over it. This is expected to rise to about €16000 when I'm finished in 2 years, at which point the interest rate will be about 1,39% but I'm not sure on this. At least not more then this.

I also have about €7000 in my savings account, over which I get about 1,00% interest. Is there anything I could do with this money that would be more useful then this? I mean, I kind of sort of make money this way so I can pay off my student debt in a few years, but is there nothing better I can do with this? I was thinking maybe invest €4000, but I see people saying this is not enough money to invest. Something else could be taking out €1000 and try investing it myself to see if it works. I really have no idea, and I'd appreciate any help.

**Tldr; I have €7000 in my savings account over which I get 1,00% interest, and a debt of €12000-16000 over which I now pay 0,12% which will maybe rise or stay the same. What to do with my money now? I live in the Netherlands.**",finance,1421522740

personalfinance,Is there any HARM in disputing something on your credit report?,"Hi PF!

I'm looking into refinancing my auto loan in early April to get a lower interest rate (lower payments= paying down CC's earlier). 

I have one item in collections on my credit report. The thing is, its from my daughters pediatrician when I have court papers that her father was responsible for her insurance coverage at the time. She was covered under insurance, but from what I understand he needed to submit a questionnaire to his insurance before they paid out the pedi and he failed to do that. The account is from May 2013. I called her pedi office last year and explained while I am her custodial parent, hes the one that was responsible for insurance. They put his info on the account. Collections has called me looking for him, but never looking for me. 

So- should I dispute this? Are there any negative ramifications? Or should I call her pedi office again and try to get them to take my info off the collections account entirely? I'm not sure what my plan of action should be, but I bet this will help raise my score.

I have a 2009 White Honda Civic LX Automatic no special packages or anything with 70,000 miles and a few cosmetic things. (Crappy Honda Factory Paint on front bumper is spider web cracking)

I paid a little over $12,000 out the door one year ago for it. 

It had 55,000 miles.

When I bought it, it had a $700.00 accident on the car fax which I used to negotiate down a bit.

Currently I am stretched too thin and don't use it as much as I do my motorcycle but I owe roughly $10,100.00 on the 10 day payoff.

I listed it on CL for $10,000 but KBB is right around $9,500.00

I got an offer for $9,000.00 so I have to come up with the difference. I just wanted to see what others thought of the deal.

Currently it's on a 5 year 3.19% interest rate I pay $245.00 a month and full coverage insurance runs me about $85.00.

Right now it would be nice to get rid of that $330.00 monthly expenditure.

My student loans have a max interest rate of 6.8%, but that's only 2 of them. The other 4 are below 5% apiece.
I read recently that it's smarter to invest than to pay off student loans early if you have a low interest rate, because the return on the investments is more than the money you'd save on interest toward the student loan. is this correct? should I get a roth IRA before I think about paying my loans off early?

My question is two-part:  First, should I file as married filing separately or jointly?  My return appears to be slightly higher if I file jointly.  

However, that leads me to my second question:  If I file jointly, would I risk the IRS intercepting some or all of my refund to apply toward her debt?  If so, how do I avoid this, if possible?

investing,Help calculating a tangency portfolio,"**Story:** I was [recently reminded](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2s6vjt/rinvesting_what_is_the_most_interesting_story_you/cnn585h) that when I took Prof. Robert Shiller's Financial Markets course on Coursera ([it's free](https://www.coursera.org/course/financialmarkets)) I was quite surprised that he presented personal portfolio management as somewhat of a 'solved problem', saying that the [tangency portfolio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) maximizes expected returns divided by risk (represented by standard deviation as you'll never account for every risk in the real world). So of course I set out to calculate one for the current situation, and failed previously. Fortunately I found an excel add-on that will calculate one for you [here (careful, the macro will only let you open and run it once)](https://sites.google.com/site/portfoliooptimizationsoftware/).

**Data:** I grabbed data for the following ETFs that I can trade commission free, that I felt would give a representative sample of assets with as little correlation as possible:

BND	Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF Shares	- Intermediate-Term Bond	- 0.08% ER  
TIP	iShares TIPS Bond ETF	- Inflation-Protected Bond 	- 0.20% ER  
VNQ	Vanguard REIT Index Fund ETF Shares	- Real Estate 	- 0.10% ER  
VEU	Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund ETF Shares	- Foreign Large Blend	- 0.15% ER  
IVV	iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF	- Large Blend 	- 0.07% ER  
VB	Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF Shares	- Small Blend 	- 0.09% ER  
 - I wanted to include DBC here for commodities, but I don't want a 0.85% Expense Ratio in my portfolio

**Problem:** BND and VEU only go back to 2007. I believe that since federal interest rates have been kept so low during this period, that my tangency portfolio will over-value bonds. It doesn't have an example of rising interest rates to show the kind of risk that BND carries, especially right now when the fed has said that they'll raise rates in the next few years. Others don't go back much farther. I switched to iShares AGG instead of BND to get back to 2003, but I'd still like much more data. Can I somehow get the historical prices for the underlying indexes, or even theoretical prices before they existed?

**My tangency portfolio: http://i.imgur.com/Ctyivoe.jpg**  

I used *monthly* data. The left axis is expected return, higher is better; the bottom axis is standard deviation, our approximation of risk in the portfolio. We want to maximize return while minimizing risk. Markowitz' efficient frontier (blue line) calculates the absolute highest (and lowest) return for a given risk level given all possible combination of assets we've plugged in. The red triangle is the minimum variance portfolio of about 95% bonds, 5% S&amp;P500 (going all bonds is *not* the lowest risk you can acquire duo to diversification of risk). The green X is the tangency portfolio, where a line intersecting the risk-free-rate (we're using US T-Bills held to maturity) hits the efficient frontier. I marked some interesting data points to show their underlying portfolio.

Please help me improve this calculation of the tangency portfolio, and I apologize if I butchered my interpretation of it anywhere.",finance,1421556886

I've seen some good advice on here, and so thought I would try my luck. I'm 31 years old, and have a pre tax salary of somewhere around 250-350 K (Canadian). It might be closer to the 220k range this year (my job's pretty flexible, and I like to take time off).

I'm married, and have a 20 month old son. We don't own a house. We do own our own car, and have no outstanding debt to speak of. Here's the real kicker- we don't pay rent. Insurance (life/disability/car) runs somewhere around 6000 per year. Then it's groceries (800 per month on food including eating out) and travel (again, we're not insane, but plane tickets are expensive, say 10 000 per year).

 * * $55,000 a year 25 years old
 * * $650.00 in debt each month
 * * $7,500.00 to put down
 * * Credit score is 700 (no bad history)

I've looked at several calculators online and none of them really give me a similar idea of how much I should spend on a mortgage. Right now rent is $1000 a month and that's cheap for my area. There are houses in the 150k range for sale in several places around me - I'd be looking at spending 150-160 max when all said and done. Is it even feasible to buy a house with my current situation? I know saving more to put down is better, and I will continue to save right up until I buy, but I'd like to try and own something come the summer time since my lease will be up.

I'm just sort of bumming about the whole thing. I'm not very good at this whole house thing and I don't even know where to start. I'd like to have a room mate which I would probably charge $500 or so - and I have a couple of people to choose from that are already interested in renting from me. I see the renter as a PLUS, so naturally I'm pricing the house on what I can afford, any relief such as a room mate is extra.

I know this is a generic and it feels like a stupid question but would I even be able to get a mortgage with the info I supplied above? If you had to guess would I be high (like 4.5%) interest rate? Is there any way to get a conventional loan with 5% down? Any help is appreciated!",finance,1421568164

financialindependence,FAFSA and FI,"Was working through the (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) FAFSA methodology and saw something interesting and thought I would share.

Federal student aid is based on this formula: Cost of Attendance - Expected Family Contribution (EFC) = Financial Need.

The Financial Need is what they would look at to determine loans and grants.

But going through some of their worksheets, there seems to be a pretty big loophole they need to fill. There are TWO exceptions that have the potential to score you an EFC of zero or near zero that posses synergy with FI.

1. If your adjusted gross income (AGI) is $24,000 or less and you file form 1040A*, your EFC is zero
2. If your AGI is $49,999 or less and you file form 1040A*, your EFC can use the ""simplified"" form. 

The simplified form doesn't include assets from either the student OR the parent, WTF?!

*Other forms work too but this is the broadest one.

In any case, seems like they should tighten that part up because a millionaire with zero income and a HELOC (or cash to float) could pull zero AGI pretty easily and qualify for Financial Aid...doesn't seem right.

Anyways, I guess my point was that if there are any 17-18 year old FI folks out there who have already started their stash, and your working class parents are close to that $50k AGI mark, may be worth it to drop down to exclude assets (of both you and your parents) and give you guys a little more of a head start in life.

I have the option of depositing some of my money into this deal, and it claims to reach maturity in 2 weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, they will take out 20% of my interest gained (for tax purposes), and deposit the remainder back into my account.

Currently fixed rate at 3.75%. 

Their offer take a credit card (no problem, wont use) card maintenance 40 euro year and first year insurance 100 euro.  

reward 0,25% less until the 1st of October 2018. so 3.50%. That means I will save approximately 21 euros a month so it is already worth it just for that.

After 1st of October 2018 it falls to euribor+2 points. If euribor is low..for example 0,5%...you will pay 0,5+2=2,50% interest rate , instead of 3,75%.

So they have removed my minimum 3.75% but also my maximum 14%. I have read up on the eurobor and it does look like accepting the offer is the way to go. I don't believe it will rise dramatically although I do believe the EU will be recovering by 2018-19 and they may start to increase rates.

I just wanted to run it past you guys here to see that I am not making any major mistakes accepting this offer. I don't believe the eruobr will increase greatly in the near future or beyond. I may be wrong.

Been a long time lurker and have learned so much from reading, but now a big, expensive decision is coming up and I could use some help.

My GF and I (25 years old/full time jobs/no debt) are planning to move back to California to start a new chapter of our life. I've lived in NYC for the past four years and have accumulated a a few items of value (e.g. speakers, desktop computer, cooking utensils and small appliances), but now we need to figure out the most cost effective way of moving. One idea we had was to rent a U-Haul and drive with everything, but we realized we'll need a car when we get to California so it would be better if we used the money renting a car as a down payment for a used car. 

Now the question is, where do we buy our car? The scenarios we came up with are:
1) Sell as much as possible, box up everything else, buy a used car in NYC (or a cheaper east coast state), load up the car, and drive across country
2) Sell as much as possible, box and ship everything via UPS/Fedex, fly back to California, and buy a car once we get back.

Can anyone who has done something like this before give me some advice? Or, does anyone have advice on what states have the cheapest after-tax car prices?

personalfinance,Need help with tax and money management planning with combined w-2 and 1099 work.,"I am recently started a 1099 position on a part time basis and have an ongoing w-2 position that is half time.  I've been doing quite a bit of reading on tax issues for 1099 work, as I don't have any prior experience with this.  I think I have a strategy worked out, but I'd like to post here and see if I'm making any obvious errors or incorrect assumptions.  More generally, I would be very interested in feedback regarding whether or not I should consult some sort of tax or financial advising professional about all of this.  

For my W-2 job, I am making about $50k per year.  Given that I want to minimize the risk of oweing money at year end, I plan to claim 0 exemptions and let this income get taxed at the normal rate, without any additional withholding or adjustments on my part. 

For the 1099 job, the income will be unpredictable, but likely in the range of 45-70k.  Given that this potential window will straddle multiple tax brackets, it seems like a safe assumption to just assume 28% for fed income tax.  Combining that with 16% for SS and 3.5% for state income tax, I basically plan to set aside 47.5% of every 1099 paycheck in a savings account and make the necessary quarterly payments as they come due.  

Does this sound about right?  Given these numbers, would it potentially be financially advantageous to consult with some sort of professional about this plan? Also, I know some people in my field who are completely self-employed set up s-corp arrangements.  I've tried reading up on these a bit, but the potential advantages are hard for me to grasp, and it's unclear whether it would be worth the money and hassle at my income level. Is this something that would be worth some professional consultation?  If so, who would I want to consult with and how much should I anticipate something like that would cost?

All of which, I thought, were federal loans and were being paid back through fedloan. Apparently, one of my federal loans, a Perkins loan, was through my school.


My parents got divorced, I moved 3 times, and had quite a shuffle between high school and where I'm at now, so long story short, I have never been told that this loan existed. 

My dad and I no longer talk, and in an attempt to hang on to me, he labeled himself as my guardian on all of my loan documents in high school. When I graduated and I've been paying my fedloan account every month, little did I know that this perkins loan, and all of its paperwork, were being sent to my dad. Since we dont get along and he doesnt care for me anymore, he didnt tell me or my mom. The loan was sold to a collections agency who again, tried contacting my dad with no success.

I got a call the other day from the collections agency trying to find me, and I had no idea what they were talking about. They provided my dads phone number and his address when they cited attempts to collect. 

I had great credit, 780+, and now that this happened, it is reported as in default. My question to you guys is, were they in the wrong by not contacting me, the person whos credit was being affected until after they reported on my credit? They had my phone number obviously since they contacted me the other day. Also, they are asking for an extra $2,500, 50% of the original loan. Most of that I assume is a collections fee, but is this a situation where I can negotiate?

I hadn’t really tried to figure out a plan for my debt before now because it is scary to think about. Lurking on PF has made it a little easier to look at.

My mom was unemployed for 2 years and we never had much money. We live in a one bedroom apartment and converted the small office room into my room, it's one of the cheapest places around for roughly $1500 a month (started at $1200 six years ago). Tack on $300 for water and another small amount for property taxes annually (yeah, weird to pay taxes while renting we know). My mom has no money saved up, she's in severe credit card debt, and I need a plan.

Even though not speaking to my father, I'm close with my grandparents. For two people who did not attend college they spent a lot of time saving and investing and have made a very comfortable retirement. They've always helped me out, and helped my mom out while she was unemployed. I only have a year and a half of high school left, so we've decided to stay where we are.

I myself have a good amount of money for a 16 year old thanks to my grandparents. They got me involved in several mutual funds and a college fund at birth and saved money for me. I'd say I have roughly $45,000 in my name. I also have a car worth around $4,000. While I hate to think about losing my grandparents they have told me I'm one of three beneficiaries for them and they have a net worth around $2,000,000 from what I know.

The plan for myself isn't what I'm worried about, I'm mainly worried about my mom. She's in her early 50's, she's out of shape, has severe high blood pressure, the crippling debt I mentioned, etc. In the summer I visit close friends in Florida and one's dad said there's going to be a lot of job openings, paying between $15-$18 an hour and there were not many qualifications, mostly just training. I told her about it, how there's no income tax, two bedroom apartments for $900, and my grandparents were going to make a snowbird trip (an possible full move) down there so we wouldn't be alone. She just doesn't want to hear it, and instead chooses to not get much of anything done to save money around here. She still smokes and pays for cable even though I told her she can learn to use Netflix and save a lot of money right there, but won't listen to me.

I'm afraid of what's going to happen when I'm gone and she'll have to worry about her car finally breaking down, shoveling snow, taking care of the dog, etc. Her answer for the snow was ""I'm going to pay someone to do it"" and I turned around and said ""With what money?"".

Eventually I got fed up and said ""when I'm out of here don't ask me for help if you aren't going to learn how to help yourself first"" and she got really offended and told me to leave her alone.

I understand that I may be eligible to file for tax deduction, but I have no idea when or how to file. Can someone briefly summarize what I should look up? I can do my own homework - just need a pointer on where to start. Thanks in advance.

*UPDATE 1/19*: So I contacted HR and found my pay stub. It shows that I was paid $1057.60 before taxes. I ran my salary through a salary-to-hourly [converter](http://www.calcxml.com/calculators/convert-salary-to-hourly). However, I can't figure out the math. Can someone break down the following formula for me? Thanks.

""A salary of $55,000 equates to a monthly pay of $4,583, weekly pay of $1,058, and an hourly wage of $26.44.""

*UPDATE AGAIN*: Nvm I figured it all out. The hourly rate is calculated from the monthly salary and the number of working days per month. I was calculating using an idealized 20 workday month which is incorrect.",finance,1421618657

personalfinance,Question regarding breaking a lease.,"I'm really not sure if this is the right place for this so my apologies if it isn't.


Basically, to make a long story short, my girlfriend and I moved out together about six months ago. We were very concerned about location as we wanted to live near the arts district downtown near everything we enjoy. We found a place in a great location for really cheap. Thus far it's been okay, save for the constant crackheads and screaming children right out of our window of course. 


We're pretty fed up with the downsides of this place, not to mention that we live in Phoenix, AZ and this place has absolutely no central air conditioning, so during the summer it is almost 90 degrees in our tiny place.


I've read over the lease multiple times and it says nothing about breaking the lease or leaving early. Now, I should mention that this is sort of a sketch situation to begin with as the owner of the property lives in CA and the 'landlord' is just a guy who lives on the property and we hand rent to, so it is a very informal operation. There isn't a leasing office and only 8 units for the place in total. 


My question is, since it doesn't mention anything about breaking the lease, is that binding enough to where if I live (and give notice I'm leaving of course), can anyone take legal action against us if we end our lease short? Would they have a leg to stand on?


I'm pretty confident that the answer is 'no', but I'm just not wanting for that to be wrong, so what say you, Reddit?",finance,1421627318

Sometimes I've had a bit of money other times like recently, I've been flat broke. Like $4 in my bank account. 

The positives have been that I have been able to create a strong portfolio and travel to cool places to direct and produce films.

In 2014, one of my bigger projects was discontinued and a final payment of $26,000 was not made. I had put $10,000 in project expenses on my personal credit card (my only credit card). There was no credit card for my business.

After, I was completely burnt out and cut down how many projects I was taking on which meant I had no money and wasn't making any payments on my credit card. The bank eventually deactivated the card.
 
I recently borrowed $10,000 from my mom on her line of credit (with a better interest rate) and paid off my credit card in full. I've made a plan to repay my mom this year. 

I've decided to take a break from freelancing and I've just been hired as a full time salaried filmmaker at a studio. My salary is 90,000 / year. I start in February.

personalfinance,How to best take care of old defaulted student loans,"Ruined my credit when I was younger due to bad handling of my money, minimum wage jobs, not finding a decent paying job until about 2 years ago. A lot of my old small debt is about to fall off later this year or next year and have decided it's best to let that go.

I had 3 different student loans, my Federal loan I currently have in good standing and have been making payments on it for a few years. My other 2 loans are private and I haven't paid on them in years. I just ran my credit report this last week to try to get a handle on what's on there.

**Private Loan 1 - $9,591**

Last Payment Made: 6/26/2009

Judgement filed 8/22/2011 Amount listed $8,061 (I think amount above is due to accrued interest since then.)

Estimated Month and Year this item will be removed: 7/2018

From what I understand, as long as long as they file for a new judgement every 7 years, I'll always be legally tied to this debt. This is the main loan I'm worried about since I see it accruing interest and would like to start chipping away at it. What is the best way to go about this? Contacting the number on the credit report? I believe the debt was down to about $5,500 before I got behind on the payments. There are other items on my credit report from ""Direct Loan SVC System"" that reference this amount. I think this is from it going to collections...?

This one really sucked, I got behind and I was going to make a payment and they said the day before they passed it onto a collection agency who was trying to collect the balance in full. My payments were about $80/month, I just wanted to get back on track with that amount but they were demanding everything in whole or $500 payments. I was in no position to pay that at the time. I was struggling just to get by month to month as it was. The only thing I figured I could do was say screw it and blow it off. I tried really hard to get them to work with me, but they laughed at me when I suggested the prior $80/month arrangement.

Some really scummy lawyer type dude was in control of the debt the last time I had talked to them. The original loan company is listed on my credit report though. I'm not sure who I should contact... Nobody has tried to contact me about this debt since the judgement was filed in 2011. The item on my credit report with the original lenders name continues to be updated monthly saying my payments are 120+ days behind. How should I go about trying to take care of this? My hope at the time was somehow saving up the $5,500 that I originally owed and offering to pay them that to just clear the whole thing up, since the rest is interest and lawyer fees from the judgement.

**Private Loan 2 - Balance $0?**

Last Payment Made: 08/2009, I think

Estimated month and year that this item will be removed: 07/016

Remarks: Transferred to Recovery, Claim filed with government

It says payment received: $16,888

The original amount is listed as $11,173

I kind of have a hard time tracking down this 2nd loan on my credit report. Is it possible that it's fallen off the radar? I don't see any other item on my credit report with this amount owed. They payment history Ends on April 2010 with the last 120+ days late notice.

So... Maybe I got lucky with this 2nd loan? I can't find it on any of my 3 credit reports with the balance listed. I'd like to take care of what I need to, I'd like to be as smart about it as possible. Looking for advice into whether I should be worried about this 2nd loan that I can't find and how to best go taking care of the 1st loan.",finance,1421643914

Why We Love Passive Income
Why do we love passive income?? Passive Income has to be one of the greatest things ever in life. Something that we can all create to aid our balance sheets, but that few really take advantage of!
 
The passive income series was created to look at ways to earn cash on the side – how to invest some time and effort in return for a reliable and regular stream of income – with very little ongoing effort required. If you missed the first post, check it out below:
Method 1 – Get Paid to Browse the Internet
   Passive Income Series – Method 2: Income from Investing
Income from Investing
Investing is a very broad term and may well be revisited in future posts in the series. This passive income topic will look at three main areas:
Investing in Stocks
Investing in Bonds
Investing Offshore
Investing in Stocks
Stock Market investing strategies vary wildly: from investing to make high-risk gains, to investing in lower risk stocks with high dividends. A lot of people forget that stocks can offer attractive dividend yields in addition to making them money upon selling. Consider the following FTSE 100 companies performance predictions from 2012:
 2222
Impressive predictions right? Obviously, the dividend yield is largely determined by the financial results throughout the year; however some of the top performing companies are fairly ‘safe’ investment choices. Insurance groups account for a large share in the top ranking predictions and are typically quite stable investments.
Be aware that Dividend Yield is just as important (if not more so) as potential share price growth when investing. At the end of the day, the dividends are what will provide you with passive income streams. Do your research and weigh up the risks of investing in stocks – the above companies beat the return on almost any savings account in 2012!
Investing in Bonds
Bonds are often referred to ‘fixed-rate securities’. Corporations and governments typically use bonds to fund projects and investments. They define an interest rate for the return of your investment and your money is usually tied up for a given length of time. The bond will define the interest rate (also known as the coupon) and when the loaned funds (also known as the principal) are to be returned (the maturity date). The interest rates will depend largely on the duration of the bond and the financial position of the issuer. Typical bonds can range from 90 days to 30+ years and interest rates vary dramatically. Consider the interest rate offered relative to historic trends in the market. Recessions are often cyclic, yet interest rates can be very unpredictable. The longer the term of the bond, (usually) the higher risk the investment. The corporation could go bankrupt, the government in need of a bail-out, or other interest rates could become far more competitive. Do your research and only tie-up money that you know you can do without.
Bonds may be a great opportunity to earn some passive income if you are sitting on a large chunk of money and don’t fancy playing the stock market.
Investing Offshore
We have discussed the benefits of offshore investment before on SavvyScot. In a nutshell, using a simple tax calculator has huge tax advantages for expatriates and those that one day wish to retire to a foreign country. A Qrops pension transfer (Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme) allows anyone that is already living abroad (or will be within 6 months) to transfer their pension offshore into a government approved scheme and receive their pension in almost any overseas location. If you are at the stage in life (or will bw shortly) that a pension is part of your passive income, the QROPS offers numerous advantages when living abroad, but most importantly:
Reduced Income Tax Liability – Offshore schemes have zero tax at source and would only be subject to in-country legislation. If you fancy retiring to the Middle East and not paying any tax – this might be a good option!
Avoidance of Inheritance Tax – An offshore pension could prevent you from giving up a huge chunk of your net worth to the tax man.
Passive income streams are endless and can be started at any time. From Pensions to Paper Rounds – the only limit is your imagination! Whatever your passive income strategy, you need to make sure that the money you are making is joining forces with you to help you make even more money!

CryptoCurrency,"Why Darkcoin, or a similar altcoin will force the hand of governments around the world.","I'm new to crypto-currencies but what I'm not new to is the study of history, especially when it comes to the rise and fall of empires. I have never formally studied economics, so you can rest assured that I may actually know what I'm talking about.

What a lot of people don't understand is that governments and banks around the world are IN LOVE with the idea of a completely digital currency. Bitcoin is the tax-man's wet dream, and I would even go as far as saying that a world financial system run on an entirely transparent digital currency is my personal nightmare. The truth is we are already witnessing the collapse of the accidental ponzi scheme known as the petrodollar system, and it's painfully obvious to anyone paying attention that government's around the world are now getting desperate for more tax money. 

We see in the United States the police are literally committing highway-robbery during traffic stops:

[Youtube - John Oliver: Civil Forfeiture (HBO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks)

The big lie is that the oligopolies you see today in the United States and other countries were created by the free market, and that government is now here to save the day. The truth is that the free market was crippled when it took it's first two critical blows in 1913. The first blow being when the 16th amendment was ratified on Febuary 3rd, 1913, and the second of course being when the Federal Reserve Act was enacted by President Woodrow Wilson on Dec. 23, 1913. The 16th amendment legalized economic slavery, a fact which is disputed by those who foolishly believe the government has their best interests in mind. It's now obvious to a great many people that the Federal Reserve is nothing more than a private bank which borrows from the American people for FREE. Not only do they do it without having to pay us interest, but they do it without intending to ever pay it back in the first place. All of this was done in the name of ""equality"" and ""fairness"".

It is now easy to see that people all over the world have convinced themselves that greed, corruption, and war are products of a free market left to it's own devices. The reality is that income tax and prosperity are like oil and water, so whatever the government tries to tax just ends up making a mess of things.

Oh... you want to proof that capitalism was mortally wounded and has been slowly bleeding out for the last 100 years? No problem! Here is corporate tax law visualized:

Corporate tax law in it's current form has created a breeding ground for mergers and acquisitions. It's been designed in such a way that the bigger a company gets the lower the rate of return on costs.

[source](http://armstrongeconomics.com/library-research/princeton-economics-tax-reform-proposal-1996/)

These info-graphs are the clearest picture of the damage that fiscal-socialism causes to the free market. This is just one example of damage that direct taxation has done to this country. If you want to know how bad things really are, read that tax reform proposal... it's one of the most enlightening documents I have ever read.

The most frustrating part about today's society is that they don't understand how many honest businessmen they're throwing under the bus when they yell ""tax the rich!"". The only time government has EVER increased taxes on the rich was when they needed to win a world war.

[It's only when they need to defend their OLIGARCHY do they truly tax the rich](http://i.imgur.com/gbAw19z.png?1)  
Note: These numbers have not been adjusted for inflation (typical of the IRS), and the reality is much worse. A top tax bracket of $5,000,000 in 1941 would equate to a top tax bracket of $80,000,000 today.  
Source: http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Historical-Table-23

Think about what that chart represents. The government taxes people making $400,000 a year EXACTLY the same as those making millions, tens, or hundreds of millions. NOT that I agree with an income tax on individuals in the first place, as a truly free nation would have a government run primarily on consumption taxes. Hopefully you now realise just how much of your life the government has ownership of. Citizens of so-called ""free"" nations may not be literal slaves, but they are certainly under the thumb of economic slavery.

The lie is that healthcare, public welfare, and public infrastructure requires an income tax when the truth is that is the last place your tax money ends up! 

So now it's 2015 and the existence of cryptocurrencies proves yet again that necessity is the mother of invention. Darkcoin has the unique ability to obfuscate transactions so that they can’t be traced back to an individual. As far as I know this is the only cryptocurrency that has the potential for truly anonymous transactions and transaction history built into it. From the perspective of anyone who feels they’re being taxed to death this represents inherent value, something no other digital currency has.

If Bitcoin gets out of control then all the government has to do is trace the transactions and persecute the individuals, but with Darkcoin they would be forced to take drastic measures like using an internet kill-switch. If Darkcoin were to become popular worldwide on a large scale, it would force the hand of government and therefore reveal their true intentions. Cryptocurrencies may serve as light to shine on the emperor’s lack of clothes, and maybe even prove to the public that there is a need for a decentralized world currency.

The worst case scenario is that we end up with another world war which would allow the creation of a new reserve currency attached to whichever nation comes out on top. World war is a whole other topic which isn't necessary for this conversation, except for the need to point out that the concept of nuclear winter is extremely unlikely and in no way could we ever ""wipe ourselves out"". Humanity would certainly survive and the end result would be yet another centralized reserve currency.

I personally have reason to believe that we are in the middle of a global debt crisis that will start unravelling later this year. It's based on the fact that chaos theory essentially proves the existence of fractal cycles in the global economy. It is a mathematical fact that extremely complex systems have an underlying order hidden beneath the chaos. If you want to know more I suggest you study the work of Martin Armstrong, who happens to have a documentary coming out this year:

If you are sceptical of Mr. Armstrong because he was thrown in jail then I suggest you read both sides of the story and decide for yourself. Yes he plead guilty, but we all know how powerful and arguably unconstitutional plea bargaining is.

ethereum,Bit off topic: Are our current national currencies expensive?,"I posted a similar question in another subreddit, but i dont think people really understood the question (quite possibly because its a stupid question and i dont know what im talking about). There are some super smart people here so perhaps ill have more luck.

I was thinking how much cheaper it would be to trade in Ether or Bitcoin as opposed to USD because of the costs associated with producing USD, and it got me wondering: Are our current national currencies expensive?

Approximately 95% of currency is created when banks loan money. These loans have an interest rate attached, sometimes as high as 15%+. Therefore, the interest rate is essentially the cost, or fee, for producing the currency. 

By the time I buy/get national currency, the banks have already attached their interest rate/production fee to it. For example: Fed buys treasury bonds (through commercial banks) for about 3% and then creates currency which it gives to Government (through commercial banks). Government pays employees and they bank the money at commercial banks. Money is then loaned out to someone at say 4.5 % interest. That is when i can first access the currency. Is it not fair to say therefore that our currency is expensive, because the banks seized a large share of it for themselves when they produced it, thus making it more scarce, and thus more expensive as we all need it? If a government simply created currency by making it itself and paying it to government officials/workers, it would already shave off the bond rate (say 3%). When the government officials/workers banked their currency, if their was no such thing as fractional reserve lending, or it was more tightly regulated, then the banks would not produce the currency like they do and taking their share in doing so, again reducing its expense? They could charge for loans and admin charges, but thats different.",cryptocurrency,1421671269

personalfinance,Saving for NYC Condo/Co-op - where should we put the downpayment money in the interim?,"(Apologies if this was touched upon elsewhere, but buying in NYC is a bit different than most home purchase discussions I've seen here.)

Living in NYC and looking to buy in probably the next 2-3 years. In the interim we'll be renting.

Given we are looking in NYC you need a fairly large sum of liquid assets and I'm not sure where the best place to save that money is.

Below is a breakdown of where money is now and how we're saving (we being wife and I in early 30s):

1. 401k pre-tax maxed with company match (total with match $23,500 a year)
2. Receive stock equity through company regularly (vesting monthly for the most part) which I've kept as stock and not cashed out.
3. Have some small assets in individual stocks (&lt;$5k)
4. Have a size-able savings account in CIT bank earning 1% a year
5. We have no debt except paying off our monthly credit card (which we do).

I don't have a Roth IRA because, combined, we are in a top tax bracket and I have such a good 401k that we are in good shape there. More importantly, only up until two years ago has this been an option given how life has played out given grad school and life changes for my wife and I (prior to 2 years ago we were always paying or about to pay a large debt of some form which given the interest rates that took precedence after hitting my 401k company match).

Open questions:

1. To buy in NYC you need a ton of liquid assets for the downpayment, emergency fund, and home repair/investment ($200k+ at a minimum we figure). Should we just be putting that in the 1% savings account or is there a better place to put that for the next two years? (I actually don't think there is a better place, but curious what people have done in this situation)

2. Curious if there is anything else with our overall strategy that we should be doing differently. I realize an IRA of some form is likely a good move. Should we get a Roth or Traditional given our tax situation? Should we wait till we have a home purchased or start now (i.e. better to start on IRA and get in the habit even if we rent for another year given you can never time a market, life happens, etc. etc. or we are saving a large amount in our 401k now and should focus on getting a home)? Is an IRA not the right move, but something else is? If so, what is it?

I'm highly considering talking to a financial advisor who is a friend of the family in the near future. But thought you all may have some thoughts on this.

EDIT: Some other relevant info that may not be clear in my description. First, we have no kids, but will likely in the near-ish future. Also, with our current income we basically max out 401k, then I put the rest in the CIT account earning 1%. The other savings/investments we have are just legacy from things we've had before and are just growing via interest. I'm only actively investing in my 401k, the savings account, and then passively in my company's stock with the few shares a month that vest and I don't cash out.",finance,1421673306

By looking at the calendar for the next days we spot an opportunity for a short. There should be no reason for price to go above the resistance a zone around 1.52, and it would be a good place to place our short, provided we continue seeing a decline in quality of UK inflation-related data.

Alternatively, a less risky move would be to wait for worse than expected US unemployment claims, which would probably cause a small and temporary rally which, as long as UK data remains bad, would give us a good price to sell at.""

Lastly, once I reach the point where my investments in this account are equivalent to my debt, is it likely to even be worthwhile to withdraw and eradicate my student loans at their interest rate?

And other financial stuff that is over my head : ),"I am going to try to keep this short, but provide all details you may need. I have been reading PF for a while, and while I know our situation is not unique, I have some specific questions that I have not been able to figure-out by reading other people's responses. If I should post to another sub, please let me know; thanks!

I am 28 and my husband is almost 30, so we are relatively young, just entered the professional workforce in the last few years, recently got married, and talking about kids in the next few years.

Together my husband and I make ~$5,600/month. My husband has historically received small bonuses and raises during his last few years with his company. I make overtime if I work weekends (about 1x/month), and have picked up an occasional second job teaching at the local university (lasts 2-3 months or may be on a 1-time basis). The 5,600 is without the above overtime and bonuses, as they are not guaranteed.

We have about $110,000 in the bank between checking and savings that we are planning to use some/most of for a down-payment on a house.

In addition to this, we have $422,000 with an investment company. The money invested is in a variety of different types of stocks and bonds to stabilize and secure our investment and promote a moderate amount of growth over time. We would prefer not to have to touch this if possible.

Lastly, we expect about another $40,000 in cash within the next 5 months with the house sale and finalization of my late MIL's estate (the bank account and investments are also from this estate; prior to this, we had ~10,000 in savings).

Our monthly expenses that will not change after purchasing a house  are as follows:

Cell phones: 150.00
Cable/internet: 150.00 (may increase slightly, but we doubt it)
Car Insurance: 100.00
Car Payment: 230.00
Train pass: 180.00 (taken out pre-tax); will reduce by ~50-60.00 if we buy the house, since we will be closer to the city.
Private school loans: 160.00 (total loan is 18,000; it is a total of 3 loans with interest ranging from 3.45-6.7% interest. I am putting about 50-100.00 extra towards the highest interest loan each month)
Federal school loans: 475.00 (this is based on an income-based repayment plan, and I am also enrolled in a public service loan forgiveness plan, which may pay off my loans in ~10 years tax-free. Because this program is not guaranteed to forgive the entire amount, we will begin paying the MIN interest on my loans ~900.00/month in ~2 years to prevent the loan from growing; the total of these loans is 167,000 with 6.9% interest).
Credit Card: 50.00 (total is ~1,200; however, we usually pay 100-200 per billing cycle, sometimes more if I think about it. This is left-over from our wedding and surgery for our dog, which both happened within the last year; we do not use the credit card for anything else).

New monthly costs if we buy the house:
Mortgage/insurance/taxes: ~2,200 (The house is ~200 years old, but is in overall good condition. It will need slightly more maintenance than a new-build, but nothing too big at this time; all electric and plumbing has been updated, etc. We are currently negotiating based on the results of the inspection). (Our current rent is 1,150).
Electric: ~100-200 (Our current cost is 50-100/month).
Water: who knows? Our apartment has a well with a pump, so water is free, we just pay extra in electric costs.
Heating (oil): can vary, but lets say ~1000/year, so ~100/month to be generous. (this is not something we pay for now)
Maintenance and up-front costs: we will need to do a few bigger projects at first, then will be able to sit on the house for a while and do small maintenance things. We are looking at putting in a fence (we have a dog), will probably have to replace the heating unit/boiler (we are requesting a home warranty which would cover this if it goes within the next 5 years), we will need to buy a lawn mower (.78 acres), an we will need to do a little bit of work on the garage, which needs to be reinforced.

My car is very old, and may also need to be replaced soon; however, my commute to the train from the new house may only be a mile, so a small 2-3,000 car we can pay cash for that will last a few years may be our best bet.

Okay, so I have a few questions:

1. Is this too expensive for us? I know they recommend &lt;28% of income to be spent on the mortgage, etc. to avoid being house-poor; we are at 41%. We will get some pay-out from some of our investments each year; however, I am not sure how much, so that will count as extra income. Also, my little bro may come live with us for some rent while in college (~500?); however, this is not set in stone just yet, and neither is the price. We are home-bodies so we rarely go on vacation (every so often we travel to visit family; we stay with them so we do not have to pay for hotels, etc.), and prefer to sit home and watch a movie than go out; same with cooking, aside from a rare occasion. We also have this huge savings, which we could use to pay down the mortgage or my school loans if we ever felt strapped for cash. 

2. Would you wait/hope that the repayment plan for the federal school loans pays out in 10 years, or would you pay it in a lump sum now to avoid interest and get it over with? I have run some numbers; in the 10 years, I would pay ~80,000 without touching the principle; if it is forgiven, then we would ""save"" 80,000; however, there has already been talk about budget limiting payment of the full loan amount through this program (I have already contacted all of my local and state representatives and congressmen). If we pay it now, it is the second-best outcome, in that we pay the 167,000 and never have to deal with it again. I do not think I can pay large lump sums over time towards the principle under this program.

3. Kids...do we have enough left over to have kids?

My parents feel that this is a crazy prospect and that we are spending too much on the house. My husband's dad feels that it is a sound financial decision and that we have more than enough money to take this big step.

We lost my MIL ~8 months ago, and still have not sold her house (familial issues), but we are finally moving in the right direction. We got married about 3 months ago; however, we have been in a relationship for over 9 years. In essence, we are in an emotionally charged point in our lives, and I certainly do not know if I am thinking this through to the best of my ability in terms of making a sound financial investment.

In terms of the house; it is the house we want, and we are getting it for less than the appraisal cost. We still have time to pull out with minimal (~2,000) cost to us, which is why I am here asking the financial gurus.

Thank you fro your time.

financialindependence,How to de-leverage myself without getting killed on taxes.,"I'm technically FI now, though I'm still working and am not drawing on investments/savings to supplement my income. In my mid 40s, my total net worth is about 2.4 million USD. A small portion of that is from IRAs, and home equity, ~$200k. Stocks account for the rest. 

Other than my IRAs, buying equities has been my only method of investing. That started about 15 years ago, and with a few exceptions (some of which nearly ruined me) I've only bought things whose business I know something about. 

I've also used margin to extend my leverage, which by and large has worked out well -- especially since the 2009 crash. Right now, my stock holdings are worth $3.2 million, and I have a $1.15 million margin balance, so net value of just over $2 million. I pay 3.0% interest on the margin balance, so just over $30k/year in interest expense there, but I'm getting about $60k/year in dividends. 

So, here's the biggest ""problem"" (obviously a great problem to have in the spectrum of all problems...): About 2.7 MM, or 85% of my portfolio is 1 company (we'll call it XXX), so obviously my fortune is very much tied to that one company. I'd like to 

  1) reduce my margin balance, and 
  2) diversify my portfolio somewhat. 

If I do this all at once, aren't I likely to trigger the highest possible capital gains rate&gt; -- 20% + the 3.8% ACA tax + my State's 5%. So, I'd be looking at a 28.8% tax on my gains. 

My understanding of the federal CG tax rates are: 
&lt; $36,900 = 0% 
&lt; $200,000 = 15%
&lt; $406,751 = 18.8% 
&gt; $406,751 = 23.8%

My income will probably be ~$60k this year (work for my own business so it varies). And I (still) have an historic loss I can carry forward of about $65k from 2009. My cost basis overall on this company is $1.4 million, so I have a gain of $1.3 million, or ~100% return. 

What I'm thinking of doing is: in 2014 selling about $650k worth of more recent purchases of XXX, which have a higher basis, making my gain about $250k. I'll apply my $65k loss, bringing this down to a $185k gain. My normal earnings will still push this up to ~245k. So, I'd owe about $36k in federal taxes. 

But, that doesn't really address goal #2 that much, I'd still be 80% XXX, just not as leveraged (~1.3 vs 1.6). My income from dividends would be reduced to about $48k/year, my interest rate would go up by 0.5% to 3.5%, so about $18k/year on the remaining margin balance. I could boost the diversification by purchasing alternative equities instead of paying down margin with some of the proceeds, but I want to reduce my leverage and have some purchasing power in reserve in case there is a significant pull back in the next year or two. 

I could repeat the process in 2016, and zero-out the margin. 

Does anyone else have experience  de-leveraging themselves, or diversifying a highly concentrated portfolio? How did you do it? Does this sound reasonable (or totally unreasonable...)? Thanks for your feedback.

personalfinance,Considering moving out on my own in the near future. Looking for advice on starting out right.,"I currently live at home, work part time and have minimal expenses. I don't really budget anything, but I would like to start so when I am out of my parents house I don't get sideswiped and end up back home after 2 months.

I am generally very good about not letting debt build up, but I recently got an expensive speeding ticket that ended up costing me about 1300 bucks after fines, fees, and a lawyer.

Currently my take home pay is about 950 a month. If it makes a difference in any of this, right now CreditKarma puts my credit score at 744, this is down 21 points from the last update I did a few months ago after picking up the ticket debt. The last time my discover card statement came in the mail, it had me at a FICO score of 801. My expenses are as follows.

**Bills**
**Car Lease**: 199.88/mo, I have about 2 years and 4 months left on this lease.  
**Car Insurance**: 75/mo  
**Gas**: 60/mo  
**Food**: 200-300~/mo. I usually eat out 4 times a week at work for lunch, and eat out with friends once or twice a week for dinner. Otherwise my parent pay for most food in the house.  

Everything else my parents pay for. When I move out my parents will likely keep me on their phone plan until the contract is up. At which point I'll be on my own for that.
 
**Debt**  
**CC1**: 335~  
**CC2**: 1870~(Got this CC to put all my ticket costs etc on), 0% interest until February of 2016   
**CC3**: 30~ Rarely use. Doesn't have a good rewards points program. I put a few lunches a month on it just to keep the account active.  
**CC4**: 0 Amex Gold card. Will cancel when the yearly dues are due. Last time I called to cancel, they waived them, but I never use this card so I doubt they will waive them again.  

I have no other debts beyond my credit cards.

I have about 1000 in the bank. I will get 1 more paycheck(475~) next week before my car payment and car insurance are due. Once my state opens up its tax returns I will be filing my return asap. I am getting 976~ back from federal taxes and if I did the math right, about 500 back from state taxes.

My main questions involve my 2nd CC debt and what common real life expenses look like. The card has 0% interest until Feb 2016. I will pay off CC1 this month along with CC3. Would it be move advantageous to pay this card off asap regardless of the 0% interest, and then put any new expenses on it, or pay for the new expenses with cash and pay this off over time as I get extra money?

Before I move I plan to secure full time employment instead of part time. When I was looking for new jobs before, I believe I was estimating my take home pay at around 1300/mo. I plan on moving into an apartment with a friend. When we were looking a few months ago before winter, we found a couple in the 550-700 ranges, we would split it 50/50 so my rent would likely be somewhere between 275-350. Beyond that I have no idea what to expect as far as food/internet/electricity goes. Is there anywhere I can find out average rates based on city or anything?

Any other advice on things to get in order before moving out of my parents house would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions for me I will certainly answer them asap. Thanks again for any insights you can provide.",finance,1421702827
personalfinance,unsure if I should take on this property investment. any experts that can weigh in?,"Here's the background information: through good fortune and very frugal living, my wife &amp; I have a total of $400,000 saved at present. We have each had inconsistent incomes since college, though the past (2) years have been stable for me at roughly $85,000 per year. We have no debt, cars are paid off and currently rent our apartment for $1600/mo. 

My mother owns a beachside condo in Orange County, CA worth roughly $750K. The property was purchased (10) years ago for $825K, but the market has not yet fully bounced back. She has rented the unit out for the cost of the (2) mortgages for the past (7) years at $3500/mo, taking a loss on the property taxes each year but maintaining the investment. 

Her renters will be moving this summer and my mother, who is **extremely** generous, has offered to gift us her equity in the home rather than selling it to the general public. There are currently (2) mortgages, a 2nd with a debt of $130K that runs $500/mo, and the larger mortgage at $450K that runs about $2100/mo. The larger mortgage has a 4% interest rate, while the 2nd is a variable (currently at 3.5%). 

I am strongly considering taking on this investment, as I don't believe we would qualify for a good loan with our earning history despite our large cash reserves. My plan would be to pay off the 2nd and maintain the first mortgage at $2100/mo, using my cash to pay for unforeseen expenses when they arise and theoretically, if I came up short at the end of the year, I would be fine. The hope would be that the property would increase enough in value to offset any ""dipping"" into the savings, though of course I would prefer to not touch that money at all.

Long term I think the property will be worth much more than $750K, as it is incredibly close to the ocean in a good community. I would prefer to not keep renting, as our current arrangement is ending this summer as well and comparable housing in LA is going to run at least $2200/mo if not more.

Does anyone have any advice on how I should proceed? I am a bit lost, having not been a property owner before, but this seems like a good time to get my feet wet.",finance,1421704772

personalfinance,"Looking for some guidance/opinions for my first credit card, comparison between two (CA)","Been looking around this subreddit for a while trying to educate myself on credit cards and finally decided to apply for one. I'm currently caught between two and would love some input from people who have more experience than I do. I will be applying for my first credit card, I'm a student, 22, unemployed (but money from my parents), and very strict with my finances. I don't see myself ever spending more than maybe $30-50 a month on this card and will rarely be unable to pay my balance in full each month. Here's a link to the [first card](http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/credit-cards/low-interest-credit-cards/rateadvantage.html) and the [second card](http://www.bmo.com/main/personal/credit-cards/spc-airmiles-student-credit-cards).

The first card's annual fee is refundable if I pay my minimum balance every month and use the card at least once a month (won't be hard to do as I will have Netflix on it). The interest rate is lower than the other card as well (however if the Prime Rate changes then so too will my interest rate). After speaking to a rep on the phone, my interest rate will most likely be a total of 9.99. The max amount would be 11.99 which is still great. I was approved for the card. My worry is if this card is too complex for someone looking for a basic/first time/starter credit card. People have told me to just get a student card and not to worry so much haha.

The second card is a student card, has no annual fee, an interest rate of 19.99% and is with the bank that I already have a chequing account with. I haven't applied yet but I doubt I'll be denied. My worry with this card is that if I do end up having a large and unforeseeable expense on my account that a 19.99% interest rate will make it even worse and harder to pay off.

I've compared all the banks in my local area and all student cards have an interest rate of 19.99 so there's not much competition there. 9.99-11.99 is the lowest I've seen so far. As mentioned, I don't see myself having a lot of balance being carried over (but you never know!) so I'm wondering if I should go for low interest or no annual fee.

personalfinance,Should I sell my mutual funds to pay off credit card/student loan debt?,"Apologies if this sort of question gets asked a lot but I want to get as much input/advice as possible moving forward. My basic question is whether or not I should cash in some of my mutual funds in order to pay off credit card and student loan debt. 

My debts include 3 credit card accounts and a student loan. $8,000 in credit card debt spread out over 3 accounts ranging from 12-18% interest rate. I have another $6,000 owed in student loans at about a 6% interest rate. 

Upon graduation I was given about $25,000 in mutual funds from my parents that was invested in for me while I was growing up.

I am fully employed and have a retirement account through work that I contribute to. I don't yet have an emergency fund and was thinking part of this could go towards setting that up as well. I have been trying to pay off as much of the debt as I can each month but from my calculations it would take me about 2.5+ years to pay everything down at my current budget. I have very good credit with a rating at 780+ and don't plan on making any major purchases for at least the next year. 

So my questions are as follows:
1. Should I sell my mutual funds in order to pay off my debts? If so, how much?
2. How much can I expect to owe in taxes from this?

personalfinance,Should I look at debt consolidation from my credit cards?,"Please bear with me, this is my first post in this sub, and really my first one looking at getting my finances in order.

About me, 27 year old, male, single and FICO credit score of around 630.

I have been struggling for the past 4 years with trying to get my credit card debt under control. I just landed a decent paying job and am looking at options to consolidate my credit card debt to help lower monthly payments, as well as get a fixed interest rate.

I talked with a personal banker at Wells Fargo and he quoted me some numbers (very broad) just to give me an idea of what payments may look like for me.

Here's the breakdown of my debt.

Discover Credit Card- Balance $2,446.19 at 16.49% interest
Mastercard-              Balance $1,984.55 at 17.99% interest
Wells Fargo-             Balance $4,648.34 at 15.5% interest on purchases and 23.99% on cash advances

For the Wells Fargo card I have $2,298.34 in purchases and $2,350 in cash advances.

When I talked with the banker he had me give him a rough estimate of my debt and we looked at at total of $7,400 for a loan. After doing the math and having to get a new power steering in my car this weekend the total is a little over $9,000.

The estimated interest rates for me would be 8.23%-18.37% for a 12-36 month amount.

The first quote was 12-24 months where he said payments could range from $335.42-$370.97.

The seconds quote was 12-36 months where he said payments could range from $232.68-$269.22.

I guess I'm looking for guidance as to when it would be a good idea to consolidate? Are there other lenders that I should look at? Am I asking for a typical loan length amount (12-36 months)?

Bitcoin,The Nakamoto Put aka Quantitative Tightening,"One of my crazy  thoughts...

As a brief background the [""Greenspan and Bernanke Puts""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspan_put) in addition to quantitative easing were policies that the U.S. Federal Reserve used to support the prices of assets, namely the stock market. By manipulating interest rates lower and [increasing the money supply] (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?s[1][id]=AMBNS), the Federal Reserve pushed investors into risk assets thereby bidding up their price in order to create a so-called [wealth effect] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_effect).

Could Satoshi do something similar?

It is postulated that Satoshi controls approximately 1 million BTC. What if, Satoshi came out and announced that he would initiate ""quantitative tightening"" by destroying a certain proportion of his coins? Or perhaps not make any announcement and just do it? Perhaps the [burning of the coins](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn) could be done on an unpredictable schedule to prevent speculators from buying low and selling shortly afterwards for a quick profit. Is it possible that this tightening of the money supply, this deflationary event, could encourage a sustainable bid up in the price of BTC? Could this technique be used to offset potential malicious attacks against Bitcoin?

Of course, this would diminish Satoshi's overall BTC wealth but I'm not sure if this is what drives him. Perhaps he would rather live to see a more rapid adoption of his invention and its effect on the world more than anything else. I know I would.",cryptocurrency,1421713041

I racked up a lot of student loan debt, and haven't done very well paying it back over the past few years.  I did get rid of all of my high interest credit card debt, but in the mean time racked up some debt with the IRS because I was working a job getting paid 1099 and needed all my income to pay bills and keep my loans from defaulting.  I did that for almost 3 years.  Now I finally have a decent job and have some decisions to make - maybe someone can help me figure this out?

Let's start positively with the job... 

Salary $50,000

Commission structure:  Up to another $50,000 if ""on plan"" with sales (not factoring any of this into my budget currently) but all of this additional income will go toward debts.  Most everyone in my department finished above 100% of plan in 2014- so there's definitely potential.

Student loans:


1. $21,804.90 (@7.25%)


2. $3,801.15 (@7.25%)


3. $17,772.47 (@3.75%)

4. $22,415.41 (@5%)

5. $10,446.67 (@5%)

I had my payments reduced recently to around $700.00/mo but I know that's not enough - not sure what I should be paying here but want to get really aggressive on it.

Personal Loan:
1. $1,980.93 (@11% - guess)

IRS Repayment:
1. $15,568.72 (@3-4%)

Currently pay $150/mo per agreement, but the minimum should be $300 and will increase to that again in July 2015.  I think the interest rate on it is around 3-4% but cannot remember off-hand.

I had to get a car for my job, was commuting with coworkers or the bus the past 1.5 years to work.  Cannot commute to new job.
I couldn't find any deals that made me comfortable on really used vehicles so I went for something slightly used and financed... I know... I almost regret this already but only had 1 week to find a car once I knew about the job.

Car:

1. $17,000.00 - $2000 down = $16,343.75 financed at 7.9% for 60 months.

Total payments: $19,945.20 + $2,000 down = $21,945.00

I want to pay this car off faster also, if I can, by making higher payments.

Here are my monthly expenditures:

1. Rent: $440.00

2. Car: $332.42

3. Car Insurance: $100.00

4. Student Loans: $700.00

7. Internet: $25.00

8. Mobile Phone: $40.00

11. Groceries: $300.00

12. Dog Food: $50.00

Total:  $2,607.42


So here's where I'm at a dilemma, other than drowning in debt:  My new job is offering a really nice benefits package.  They throw in disability free, but have two insurance options.  One is ""high deductible"" ($4,000 deductible) and the other is ""premier"" ($1,500 deductible) and both are pretty decent on co-pay etc.  Vision and dental are awesome and only like $7/mo combined.

They match the 401K up to 50% of 6%:  if I do the full contribution (and I've read/heard it's stupid not to) then I'll be taking $250 out of my check each month.
The premiere insurance is $110 per month, the high deductible is free.

So, I suck at math, but I think I'm looking at $50,000 salary / 12 months = $4,166
- 6% (401K payment) of $250 and - the $110 insurance payment would leave me with $3,806.00

$3,806 x 0.80 (taxes) = $3,044.00 - $2,607.42 = $436.58 left over for putting toward loans and car payment to reduce faster.

I cannot figure out if I should forgo 401K and premiere insurance for the time being and focus putting all of that extra money toward my debt.  Would it be silly to pass up on 401K matching, or is it silly to even consider putting anything less toward my debt?  I just don't know what to do- I was the first in my family to go to college and really made a mess out of my loans.  I'm healthy and haven't needed to go to doctor in a very long time (30/M) on no medications.  I exercise regularly, drink rarely, and don't smoke.

I've never had a 401K or benefits at a job but I need to get this paperwork in to them as soon as I can (no rush other than getting benefits started for myself) which is why I'm looking for some help.  I've been reading a lot of your posts/advice and I've started making positive changes with my spending, but still have a lot of work to do (as you can see!)


TL;DR:  I've got a ton of debt, have a decent bit of monthly bills but have a new job that is offering me benefits.  Not sure whether to take the benefits or put the extra money toward debt and get benefits later.

Townhouse Mortgage: $600/mo (30 year, 4.5% $70k left)  

We bought a townhouse a while ago and moved about 2 years ago for work. We are renting it out currently though not for much profit due to the area ($100/mo profit). Including it here for completeness.


I'm putting 6% (minimum to max employer match) into my 401k. Currently $5k in there. $6k in savings.


Tax refund will be $2900. My thought is to clear CC2 and put the rest to CC1. Then take what I was paying on CC2 ($100/mo) and add that to CC1's payment to try and work that guy down. Am I taking the wrong approach here?


However, I'm also concerned about my 401k contribution as well. I want to increase this to 10% but not sure if I can take that hit and still save every month. Or, should I not use the extra from CC2 to pay CC1 and use that as a ""buffer"" for increasing my 401k contribution instead?


The other part of this is that my life insurance policy allows me to tuck away an unlimited amount of money into the policy at a guaranteed interest rate of 6%. Never more, never less. Should I be funneling money into that instead or are there commonly ""gotchas"" for these kinds of policies?",finance,1421716614

personalfinance,"22 years old, 72k annually, pay off small student loan debt vs cap rothIRA for 2014?","I just started reading /r/personalfinance about a week ago and now understand how important a rothIRA is to have in addition to a 401k (wish I started reading 6 months ago). 

Anyway, my question is would it be better to lighten up the payments on my loan to the minimum which would be $34.81 (before I was paying $600-900 per month) and focus on putting as much disposable income as possible towards a vanguard rothIRA, for the year 2014, before the April 15th deadline?  Or would it be better to pay off the debt first, then contribute to rothIRA?

Some factors to include:

1. have not started the rothIRA yet

2. I've only got $3K left (at 6.8% interest rate) of the student loan to pay off 

3. I have 1K in savings (ally bank) and 3K in checking account.  

4. Right now I contribute 6% to my 401k because employer matches it dollar for dollar up to 6%.

5. My monthly expenses are pretty minimal

$600 rent

$60 utilities

$119 leased car payments

$50 gas

$300 for groceries

personalfinance,Buying my first car! What should I do?,"Financial Situation: I am in the market for a car. I am a 23 year old female living in Arizona. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in May with zero student debt but continuing my education that I am currently paying for (~$1,100 per semester making payments throughout the semester). I am a first year teacher making ~$2,000/month and currently living with a family member that has asked me to pay the cable/internet bill which is about $200/month. I also pay my phone bill of $70/month. I must also add that I have NO CREDIT and have struggled trying to get a credit card over the past 6 months. When it comes to buying a vehicle I would like to keep my monthly payment no more than $250/month which will be difficult because I am thinking my interest rate will be high due to my lack of credit. This would be my first big purchase so I really don’t want to screw myself over with money.

Current Vehicle: Now my current vehicle is a 1999 Oldsmobile Bravada with 144K miles. This was my 16th birthday present that parents paid in full but the title is in my name. I still drive this vehicle on a daily basis but I am just waiting for it to shit out on me any day now. My keys are already getting stuck in the ignition often. This was such a reliable vehicle for me and treated very well plus I took very good care of it! I extremely attached even though I KNOW it is time for something new. I plan on selling this car because I think I will get more selling it outright rather than trading it in. 

What I am Looking for: I know VERY VERY little about cars but I am looking for something like a large hatchback sedan, small SUV or sport utility vehicle. My dream car would be a Mazda 3 hatchback. I am pretty adamant about having a hatchback because I want/need the space with back seats folded down. I also want something that is slightly edgy or just something that is MUCH cooler than my current Oldsmobile. With that being said, my mom and I went to CarMax yesterday and we looked at a 2013 Ford Focus (hatchback) and a 2012 Scion xB. Never in a million years did I think I would be interested in a Scion but I loved how spacious it is. I enjoyed my test drive with both of these cars. 

I also did some calculating on monthly payments with taking a 30% down payment into account, payments over 5 years and punching in several different interest rates. 

The 2013 Ford Focus SE 4D Hatchback is $13,998 at 38K miles. I know this is probably my safer choice. 

The 2012 Scion xB 4D Wagon is $16,599 at 30K miles. This is what I would go with if I listened to my heart.

Questions: Are these legitimate cars to be looking at? What other cars should I look at? What should my next step be in purchasing a vehicle? Is CarMax a legitimate place to buy a vehicle? Based on my money situation, what will be my best bet?",finance,1421721040

personalfinance,Setting up a Savings Account with an Online Bank to take advantage of higher interest rates,"I graduated from college in the past year and am looking to set myself up to be as financially sound as possible. I just finished reading ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi and wanted to make sure I was understanding it correctly.

Right now I have a checking and savings account with PNC. I get .01% APY on my savings account (&lt;$10,000). If I were to setup an account with an online bank (say Allybank, or ING) it seems I would be getting closer to 1% APY on my savings account. According to their websites, they don't have almost any fees or account minimums for their savings accounts

I would keep my checking and savings accounts open at PNC (I'll call them to make sure I am meeting all minimums and not getting any additional fees). My paychecks would go into my PNC checking account and then I would move money out into my savings account with an online bank every month.

Am I missing something here and leaving myself open to some ridiculous fees, or am I an idiot for not doing this sooner?

Also I did some preliminary research on Google, but does anyone have a resource they can share about finding the right online bank for someone in my situation (looking to use almost exclusively for higher interest rate in savings account, won't be using the checking account.)

personalfinance,The only investment advice worth repeating: Dollar cost average into a no-load index fund.,"I see lots of posts of the ""How should I invest my money"" nature.  As far as I'm concerned, there is only one answer.  I did not invent these steps, I'm not sure who did, but they're the best financial advice I have ever heard.

**Step 1**:  Count your money.  If you don't know where it's coming from or going to then you have no hope of controlling it.  Proceeding to Step 2 is pointless unless you've mastered Step 1.

**Step 2**:  Spend less than you earn.  Sounds easy but it ain't.  Again, don't bother with Step 3 until you've mastered step 2.

**Step 3**:  No debt.  There are a few exceptions:
  A) Do not even think about using a credit card unless you can trivially pay it off every month.  In other words, if you buy stuff you can't afford then go back to step 2.  If you pay it off every month then a credit card is like a free one-month loan.

  B) Car loans ONLY if they are exceeding low interest rate (like &lt;1%) and you can pay it off at any time.  If you need a loan in order to purchase the car then you can't really afford the car, go back to Step 2.

  C) Home loan.  This can be tricky because it's common to buy more home than you can really afford.  However, if you buy an affordable home, with an affordable mortgage payment and good interest rate, then a home loan can actually make you money by keeping your assets liquid.  But only if the mortgage doesn't crush you.

**Step 4**:  Savings.  If you have a 401K, max that baby out.  If you might need that money before retirement then I'd argue that you haven't done steps 1-3 correctly.  Only after you are debt-free, have your 401K maxxed, and have a a year's worth of cash laying around, only then should you even consider step 5.

**Step 5**:  Dollar cost average into a no-load index fund.

""dollar cost average"" simply means putting in a fixed amount every month.  It works because your dollars buy more shares when the market is down and fewer shares when they're expensive.  Ask Google for a better explanation.

""no-load index funds"" One of my biggest regrets is listening to a professional stock broker back in 1993.  I had marched into his office wanting to invest into a relatively obscure company (he hadn't heard of it) called Microsoft.  Instead, he talked me into the brokerage's favorite mutual fund.  At the time I failed to understand that past performance does not guarantee future results.  I also failed to understand that more than half the ""experts"" under-perform the market average.  The ""no-load"" means you aren't paying for the broker's Porsche.  The ""index fund"" means you'll outperform the experts in the long run.

**Step 6**:  There is no step 6.  Steps 1-5 are boring but they work.  If someone tries to tell you otherwise then they are probably charging you for their advice.

I take it back, if you follow Steps 1-5 correctly then Step 6 will be don't tell your friends that you plan to retire early or else they'll want your money.

Of course everyone is different.  These steps don't work for lottery winners or billionaires but they sound advice for the rest of us.",finance,1421736980
personalfinance,"~$5,500 in ex-employer 401K &amp; ~$45,000 in student loans - 25 years old making $100K/yr","I quit my previous employer last April and had just shy of $5,500 in my 401K that was 4% matched. I finished grad school in August and currently have ~$45,000 in federal student loan debt at interest rates between 4.51% and 6.8%, with the largest interest rate to debt loan being a $10,500 Graduate Student Plus loan @ 6.41% interest. 

My 401K rate of return was only ~3.5% over the past 6 months, and seems to be decreasing month-over-month. 

Of the ~$45,000 in student loans, my parents will be paying for the undergraduate portion (around $13,000) over the next few years, leaving me with ~$32,000 to pay back as part of a 120 month payment plan. 

I've fallen into a lucrative software startup that is paying me very well ($100K/yr but as a 1099 contractor--so no 401K) so I wouldn't hurt too badly paying the monthly payment as-is.

personalfinance,Need student loan advice!!!,"Hi guys,

I just finished grad school and have ended up with approx $179K in federal student loans. Pretty scary thinking about the repayment and total amount of interest that has racked up during the past 2 years. I feel pretty damn stupid and should have made better decisions/planning to manage the costs of tuition/living expenses, etc. But must look forward now and do whatever I can.

I'm about to take the board exam (physical therapy) and assuming all goes well, starting entry level salary in my area is between $72-78K/year. 

Now I do own a house with a significant amount of equity (approx $200K mortgage currently and valued between $1-1.2 million). I'm not sure if I can but do you guys think the bank would let me do a refinance/cash out so I can essentially pay off the school loans and tack it on to my mortgage with a lesser interest rate (4% versus 6.5%). My concern is the bank will see the amount of debt I have in school loans and just laugh...but I'm hoping the equity in the house can turn that around. 

Otherwise, the standard repayment plan will net a $2000 monthly payment or I can extend to a 25yr income based plan and pray that I can work in the public sector to receive loan forgiveness. 

Any advice or guidance is greatly appreciated!!",finance,1421745261
personalfinance,"21, taking time off school to work. Would like some advice on how to make the most of the money I earn.","I've just finished my 5th semester, studying computer science and likely going to work in software. I'm taking a semester off for an internship. I'll be earning a good amount of money, and would like to make sure I make the most of it.

**Current situation:**

I have just under $17k in savings, no debt. Most of this money is in a high-interest rate savings account (0.99%). I get excellent financial aid, so school is almost free for me--I only pay about $2k/yr. This includes tuition, housing, and a meal plan.

**Upcoming internships:**

I have positions lined up at two companies, both in San Francisco. I do not have to pay for food during the workweek or any transportation. I am considering getting health insurance, but I'm not sure if I will, and how much it would cost if I did.

*Company A:* 15 weeks. $7.1k/mo income. 1.8k/mo rent.

*Company B:* 12 weeks. $8k/mo income, housing included (so no rent to be paid). Also has a lot of perks included - free laundry service, free haircuts, free gym membership, etc.

Considering I will have a lot of disposable income, and I don't foresee any large expenses coming up, I thought this would be a great time to start doing some smart saving. I'm not sure if the best option is to simply let it sit in my savings account accruing a bit of interest, or if there are other ways to get the most out of the money. I've done a bit of research into the Roth IRAs, but I don't know if that's the best avenue for me -- and even if it is, that's only $5.5k this year.

personalfinance,Debt collecting process seems fishy...advice?,"Hey guys, this is kind of a long story but I'll try to keep it succinct. 

When I was 18 I took out a private student loan in my feeble attempts to finish my college degree. I eventually defaulted on the loan and it haunted me for a good long while. It was about 22K. I've slowly gotten myself to a great place when it comes to finances - have a well paying job, have paid down all of my debt save for this loan I defaulted on and my wife and I's car loan (about 10K) which I am promptly paying off - never a late payment. My credit score is now about 685-690 with all three credit bureaus.   

Last year, a debt collector served me papers about the student loan I defaulted on, so I gave them a call to work out a payment plan. We came to the agreement that I would pay down 3K as a sign of good faith and would pay down the loan in small monthly increments with the option to give a lump sum later down the line. All told, I paid off about 5K of the loan. Last month I noticed that the monthly payment hadn't been drafted from my account and it was pretty late in the month already so I called up the debt collection folks I'd been working with. The ""agent"" that had been working with me basically told me she didn't know anything. They had given the accounts back to some other company and I would need to get in touch with them. Now, my problem with this piece is that no one told me anything. Had I not been keeping an eye on things, this would have totally blindsided me. 

So, this lady can't even give me the name of the agency that now holds the debt and after keeping me on hold for 10 minutes gives me the number of some law office and tells me to ask for someone in particular. I call and they tell me no one by that name works here and we don't know anything about your debt. Sorry. 

Finally, last night I get a call from some local law office while I'm in the gym. When I try to call back, no answer. At the same time, I get a notification from FedEx that an overnight envelope is scheduled to be delivered today. I'm guessing this is either them trying to collect on the debt again or straight up trying to serve me. 

The last time I was served papers was a super stressful, emotionally draining situation and although I feel better equipped to handle it now, I still desperately wanted to avoid that. My questions are, were any rules or laws violated with the way this was handled? Do I have anything I can defend myself with for this type of thing? I've got signed agreements about the monthly installment plan and kept a detailed record of every payment I ever made to the original debt collector. I'm worried they're going to ask me to drop down another lump sum in order to keep a payment plan going which I'll have to take from my wife and I's mortgage savings. This is crushing.

personalfinance,"Another buying vs renting conundrum, please help!","My boyfriend and I (both 23 years old) have been stressing over if we should buy or rent this year when our current lease is up.  Our combined income is $7,000 a month which will be increasing by $500 in June when I get a raise.  My boyfriend just recently paid off all of his student loans, which absolved us of all our debts.  We have no car payments, or credit card debts to pay off.

At the moment we are living in a 2 floor apartment for $2500 a month (not including utilities).  We have one roommate.  Collectively my boyfriend and I pay $1800 towards rent.  I'm not sure what my boyfriends bank accounts look like but I imagine they are pretty similar to mine (since we started working around the same time last year).  I have $16,000 in my checking account, $4,000 in savings and $5,600 in a fixed term IRA (he probably doesn't have an IRA).

A house in our area was put up for sale at $349,000 in the summer of 2014.  It's still on the market and they reduced the price to $339,000.  It's a newly renovated cape cod.  The only thing that was not updated was the roof which will have to be replaced in about 5 years.  The taxes on the house are estimated at $7,000.  My parents have offered to put a down payment of $100,000 on the house should we choose to buy.  We would be responsible for paying the mortgage, insurance, and taxes as well as any maintenance the property needs.  Right off the bat we would have to buy a refrigerator, washer and dryer for the newly renovated home.  My parents are also convinced that if we made an offer of $300,000 the sellers would accept it, since it's a stale listing.

That would make the mortgage loan $200,000.  Assuming a 4% interest rate, our monthly payments would be around $2,000 (for a 15 year mortgage, including taxes and insurance).

I guess my main questions are:

* Are the above calculations correct on monthly payments?
* What would you do in our shoes?  Are we insane for thinking of buying at this ""young"" of an age?
* For all those that own a house, how much does maintenance cost on a monthly or yearly basis?

We want to make a financially sound decision but we have no idea what we're doing.  Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1421771701

personalfinance,How to calculate whether to use IBR public loan forgiveness?,"My wife is in the military and I work in the private sector.  My student loan debt is basically gone but she has ~$25,000 or so in federal loans.  Almost all of these loans are subsidized and accrue no interest.

Most of her ""income"" is in the form of untaxed allowances such as housing and subsistence and her actual basic pay package is relatively low, ~$31,000.  Right now we are contributing the max to her Roth TSP and Roth IRA, ~$23,500 expected for 2015.  We are currently paying ~$500/month on these loans.

My question is...

Should we...

1.  File separately and put her on an IBR repayment plan (which would drastically lower the payments and also make her eligible for the loan forgiveness program)
2.  Switch to funding Traditional instead of Roth.  The benefit here would be that her taxable income would drop to almost nothing and the IBR repayment plan would likely be $0/month (which would still quality as a payment under the plan)

Is there a way to calculate how much of a hit we would take in taxes by filing separately?  Is this even worth considering?  Or should we just continue on our current path which is projected to have these loans paid off within 5 years?

If we did go with the IBR and the information above, what would happen if she separated year 9 of the 10 years?  We aren't really accruing interest so I'm not concerned with that aspect but 10 years is a long time, she might separate.",finance,1421775959

personalfinance,Paying off 19k this year.,"I'm trying to figure out what my best plan of action for my auto loan is. 

Here's my one and only debt. 

I owe 19k on my car and it's only worth about 12k according to KBB (I rolled my old upside down loan into this one when I purchased a new car) 

The car is great. 2 years old. It was damaged a year ago when someone smashed into while it was parked but it was all repaired. 

I recently refinanced it and have a 3% interest rate over 60 months. My monthly payments are 356 and my insurance is 170. The most of my monthly expenses. 

Now it's not a car I truly want mainly because it's beyond my needs. I was dumb when I made the purchase and didn't think about what I needed rather than what I was sold (typical new car buyer) 

I am currently working 2 jobs 7 days a week. I've been putting all of my money from my weekend job into a savings account. 

I eventually want to take a few months off from work to travel. I'm really into the outdoors and am considering purchasing a cargo van to convert it so I can use that on extended road trips (a dream of mine I've had for a while)

Now the actual question. I have thought of a few options and wonder which is the best. 

1) pay off my car as fast as I can. I calculated about 1500 a month to pay it off by the end of this year. (My math might be way off because I just divided 19k by 12)

2) attempt to do what Dave Ramsey advises. Sell car and have a loan for the difference I owe and then take saved up money to buy van or other used vehicle. 

3) save up enough money for travel and a couple months of bills and take the time off to travel. 

4)? Better option

personalfinance,"25 years old with $100k in assets. $50k cash, $50k investments. I think I have too much cash. Please help","Hello personal finance,

I have been considering posting here for quite some time and finally decided to take the time. 

About me:

I am 25 years old working in the tech industry in California making $72k per year (receiving a promotion to 80k right now but that hasn't taken affect yet). I put 15% of my salary into company stock bought at a discount (free money!!) and 6% of my salary into 401k, which is matched by my employer for 3%. I have no debt of any kind except for a CC which I use for everything and pay off in full every month.  I recently learned that my credit score is 808. I currently net ~50% of my gross income each month. The breakdown is -21% for the stock/401k and -30% for state/federal taxes (some of which I expect to get back). That leaves me with $2,730 to spend each month (keeping in mind that I already save 21% before I ever see any money).

Expense breakdown:

Rent: $905

Util: $50

food: $600 (I love going out, almost every meal...)

misc: $350 (I dont always spend this but i like to plan for it)

total expense: $1905

Net Income: $2730 - $1905 = $825

I currently have 50k cash in a savings account earning an absolute dismal interest rate of 0.05%, $40k in stock, and 7k in my 401k.

My question for you:

I want to do something more with my 50k cash. My only constraint is that I do plan on buying a house in the next 2 years. As you may have already noticed I am extremely risk adverse (hence the 50k cash) and would like to know what are some fairly low risk investments I could make that could earn me a better return over the next 1-2 years.

finance,[Profitability Index and IRR],"I am reading up on investments programs and came across the profitability index and IRR.

I've understood how to come up with the numbers but I am not quite sure when to use which model. Especially since under the right circumstances both models can lead to different decisions.

Can anyone explain to me when to use which method?

In my eyes PI is in every way superior since it takes interest rates, employed capital, PV and the potential return into consideration.

IRR on the other hand completely ignores interest rates and isn't even applicable to investments with negative cashflows after the initial investment.

So what is the use of IRR?

Edit:

Okay so I think I have found the answer myself. As I see it, there are 2 main components your average interest rate (dependent on your capital structure) and the potential return. 

So I could use PI to see how good my investment is with my current capital structure. If I would compare it with IRR, I would see the ""potential"" that still lies in this investment.
I could of course raise my potential return by increasing my efficiency but this would increase my IRR and PI. But if I just want to improve PI I need to restructure my capital structure in order to achieve a lower average interest rate for this investment.

So in conclusion IRR is like a benchmark or the ideal case while PI is a representation of my current or real return considering the average capital costs.

personalfinance,When is it appropriate to refinance for a lower monthly mortgage rate?,"I'm not sure about all the details I need to include so if you have questions please feel free to ask. 

My mortgage payment is $930 a month. About $550 in Interest, $250 in principal, and the rest in escrow. I owe about $150k and the mortgage is less than a year old. I would like to lower my monthly payment but I'm not really sure about all the ins and outs of it. It seems like the biggest downfall is you essentially lose all the money you paid in interested (~$7k/yr for me).

Ideally if I could get it below $700/month I would be pretty satisfied. My credit is 750+ and I am definitely able to afford the current mortgage (plus other expenses) but at the same time I don't have a ton of breathing room. I am in a well paying field (software development) but I would like the flexibility to be able to live off a lower income.

When I google this I see a lot of info saying how refinancing can be nice because you can lower your interest rate and end up saving money in the long run but my interest rate isn't that terrible (4.5%) to begin with though it does have some room for improvement. It just seems like a lot of resources I read aren't really geared towards my perspective.

My mortgage company (Nationstar Mortgage) keeps sending emails about a refinancing offer but I'm afraid to talk to them because I don't trust them. I'm looking for some non-biased opinions.

The key points of their email are:

*No appraisal fees

1. Convert all bonds to cash.
2. Change Roth TSP allotment to 100% of my base pay for the 2 months and change it'll take to reach the yearly contribution limit, and live off the cash from the bonds.
3. Whatever's left over, put toward repaying debt and/or emergency funding.
4. Later use the Roth fund toward a down payment on a house and any fees/moving expenses.

financialindependence,Surprising self-evaluation after first year on the job.,"In the spring of 2013, I graduated after a long time in school (4 years for undergrad, 2 years for grad school, 3 years for professional school). I had landed my dream job and intended to pursue financial independence. Because of all that school, I entered the workforce on the older side (28) in the fall of 2013.

I had been very frugal in school and for years had tracked every single penny I spent. For 2014, I decided to budget a little differently. I set an aggressive auto-investing schedule and allowed myself the freedom to spend whatever was leftover however I saw fit. I didn't track my spending at all for the entire year of 2014.

Then at the beginning of 2015 I decided to do a self-evaluation to see how things had gone in 2014 and to set goals for 2015. So I decided to add up all my spending for 2014. I was extremely apprehensive because in my mind, I had been living extravagantly and I certainly hadn't taken any extreme cost saving measures.

However, when I crunched the numbers, I found out that I had spent a bit over $12,000 -- just over the federal poverty line for a household size of one. This was incredibly eye opening to me. For the first time, I truly understood how powerful controlling the spending side of the equation is. I could take an 80% pay cut, maintain my spending levels, and still put a little money away. In just my first full calendar year of working, I could get laid off and have enough savings to maintain my spending levels for a couple years.

I also realized just how crazy most people's spending habits are. I had been having the time of my life, ""free spending"" without a second thought and I couldn't possibly imagine how I would spend tens of thousands of dollars more per year even if I wanted to.

Realizing just how little I need to spend to truly be happy has been quite powerful for me. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",finance,1421790261

Let me begin, Spring 2014 I rented a book from valorebooks.com fast forward to now and I still have the book that I rented, it's a long story, I lost the book, bought a new one and forgot to return the lost one that I ended up finding later. 

So now I am getting emails from ValoreBooks and Fedchex saying that they are trying to collect a debt on the book that I never returned. I give Fedchex a call, they tell me that the call is being recorded and this debt will NOT affect my credit score. I tell them that i have the book and intend on returning it. They tell me that I need to pay $30 something so that they can send me a shipping label for returning the book, I tell them that the email I received from valorebooks says that the late fee for returning a book is only $5. Fedchex tells me that I have to pay a higher fee because ValoreBooks (VB) hired them to collect my debt and until I did so they would not send me a shipping label. I told them that I was going to contact VB because I did not intend on paying Fedchex.

NOW, it turns out that VB, in one of their previous emails, had already sent me a shipping label and so I quickly printed it out. I then contacted VB and they said that I should return the book and contact Fedchex about having the fee dropped as there is nothing that they can do.

So here is my predicament. I have every intention of returning the book, what I don't intend on doing is paying Fedchex because fuck them. I also have no problem with paying VB the late fee but again, I do not plan on paying a collection agency. OH and one more thing that I forgot to mention, the credit card that I used to rent the book has since been canceled so they have no way of charging me.

What do I do? Please help me solve this problem, what happens if I return the book but don't pay Fedchex? Will it hurt me in the long run somehow? Help me /r/personalfinance , you're my only hope.

TL;DR a collection agency contacted me because I never returned a book that I rented for college, I have the book and intend on returning it but I don't intend on paying the collection agency, also the credit card I used has been canceled so they can not charge me.

If you have health coverage from your school, this is considered Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC), so your parent(s) can claim you as covered for whatever months you were a student.  If you were covered under either parent’s employer health plan, this is also considered MEC. 

If your parent(s) purchased family health coverage through the Healthcare Exchange (healthcare.gov, and your state will have its own name for its plan), they may be eligible for the Premium Tax Credit (PTC), which can be paid directly to the insurance company to help your parent(s) pay for coverage.

1. Pay off all my debts, start over, and save aggressively while living at home for the next year to build everything back up.
2. Stay home another year and pay off as much as I can month to month aggressively which should get the debts down to next to nothing. Take the 50k, move some of the checking over for an emergency fund and invest the 50k for the next few years so I can have a nice down payment on a house. I feel like with the right advisor/research I can beat the current interest I am paying on my debts.

In 2011-2012 I was going to school full time, and in Sept of 2011 I received a job offer. I continued school through about March 2012, when I was given a full time job offer. However, I had received a federal grant for that semester and because I didn't finish up those remaining credit hours it was revoked. Keep in mind: this wasn't a federal loan, but a federal grant being revoked.

I was contacted a few times through mail, but didn't pay the debt. 

Recently, I spoke to one of the collectors about the possibility of making payments within a month or so. Shortly after, my husband had some severe medical issues that left me unable to follow through for a short time. About three weeks after my initially talking to the collector, I hadn't spoke with him yet about rescheduling the payment. Then one day I get a call from my mom that the collector tried contacting me from my parents' home phone (Which was on none of the school records). He didn't tell her about the debt, but said he needed to 'talk to me about business'.

Now, this made me really upset. I thought it was illegal for debt collectors to contact family if they already knew how to get ahold of you? I told this to the collector the next time I spoke with him, and he seemed to back-pedal a bit, saying that because I never gave him permission to leave a voicemail at my current cell number he had the rights to find other forms to contact me. While I was on the phone with him I told him that I planned on contacting my university to see if I could set up payments through them. 

I spoke to the university and told them my situation about the collector contacting my family and wanting to see if I could pay them directly, and they said it wouldn't be a problem and they'd get it set up so I could pay online. But a few days later I received an email from them saying that they wouldn't be able to set me up and I'd have to go through the collector.

So now I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth about this whole situation. I really don't want to deal with this collection company, and apparently the university doesn't want my money that bad? I guess my question is: because the university declined my direct payment to them, am I still liable for this debt? I thought I had read something that there was some sort of law that said if they refuse payment you are relieved of a debt? Is there anything I can do about the collection agency? I know I should have just paid it off, but at this point I'm extremely irritated about the slimy nature both the collection agency and university have shown me. 

Any advice is appreciated. Give it to me straight guys. :(",finance,1421805910
personalfinance,Am I going to have to pay taxes on my parents home?,"Long story here, brace yourself.


My parents owned a business several years ago and didn't pay their taxes like they should have. They owed tens of thousands of dollars to federal and state taxes,which resulted tax liens that prevented them from being able to purchase a new home. My parents asked my grandmother to finance the home as the tax liens were to fall off ""soon"" (found out later that they got renewed), my grandmothers debt to income ratio was slightly out of whack and resulted in her needing a co-signature for the mortgage. My parents asked me to sign, and after much debate I decided to help them out and do it (big mistake, lesson learned). My grandmother died shortly after the loan was originated. So her portion of the home went to her estate. My parents were afraid to do a succession because they assumed the IRS would take the home. Eventually after the home caused family issues, my parents did the succession which put my grandmothers portion into my moms name and the other half still in my name. They then sold the home for a loss but still received ~$20,000 from the equity.


My questions are


Do I file the 1099-S form in my name, or would it be done on my parents taxes


If I'm to put it on my taxes, am I going to be responsible for paying the tax on the proceeds? or would it fall under the $250k exemption (parents lived there for 6 years).


I plan on talking to my CPA, but I'd like to get a second opinion.

I have some extra cash, about $2,000 if you want a number. I know it's not a whole lot of money, but I would like to try something with it. It's ok, if I lose the money- I don't need it. I would rather earn some experience. 

So, getting to the point. Other than the obvious stock market, what else is there that is short term (trading very often; ex. every week or something)? I always see precious metal prices rise and fall crazy, and so does foreign currency. Is there a way I could trade money or metals and make some money? If that idea is flawed, what else could I do?

Additionally, my bank account(s) (linked with parents), both Wells Fargo and B of A, hardly earn any interest. Something like 10 cents every while (have about a couple grand in the accounts). Someone at Wells Fargo told me that since my account is connected to my dad's, I could do something to raise the interest rate. I don't know what he means by it. Apparently my dad has a very large account; we get calls from Wells Fargo representatives all the time to talk about investing and whatnot. Is there anything I can do to use that towards my advantage?

Not related, but is getting a credit card a good idea? I don't need it, but since I apparently use a lot of money it can be beneficial to start building my credit now.

First of all, many thanks to everyone in this subreddit. Started using YNAB a couple of months ago and was able to make some solid improvements in both understanding my budget as well as cutting back on some things I didn't necessarily need.

I've gained some savings in the process, but unfortunately in Japan, where I live and work, the interest rates are extremely low (0.025% interest on a savings account where I deposit about $500 every month). 

I have a bank account in Europe as well, where I was born, where I would get 1.10% interest on my savings account. The exchange rate is currently around 137 yen for 1 euro, but it's fluctuating quite a bit, going both up and down.

How would I make an informed decision wether it's worth it to transfer my savings to Europe and start receiving interest there? I keep worrying the future exchange rate losses would be worse than the interest I'd gain. 

Also, are there any other options that are not incredibly complicated or take a huge amount of effort to increase my savings without moving it to another country? I'm interested in investing some of the money, but have no clue where to start or about the risks involved.",finance,1421828525

personalfinance,"Planning move from condo to house, need advice on timeline with current","I am wondering if we are making a sane choice in trying to move ASAP to a house. I understand it's always better to plan for longer term goals, however our situation is limiting our kids, and driving our neighbor crazy. We need space, and could be in a much better area/dwelling in a rural location, compared to what we are paying for closer in to the city. 

A quick overview of our our current situation is as follows (family of 4):

* Combined income is just under $6k monthly (after taxes, retirement)
* $15k car loan, $240/mo
* Daycare for two, $1050/mo (dropping by 1/2 soon)
* Current condo payment is $1420/mo + assoc fee $150/mo, (interest rate was 4.75%)
* No other debt, credit card is paid off weekly
* Condo purchase price was $195k in 2011 (owe $188k on mortgage)
* Conservative estimates of list price now are about $205k (redid kitchen, favorable area for commuters who work in the nearby towns/cities)
* Looking to move to a house around $250k (interest rates now seem closer to 3.5%, excellent credit)

Essentially, with a small delta of maybe +$100 in payment, we could own more house for our money, in a more rural location which is arguably better for our needs/wants.

I understand moving from a condo to a house will incur other costs. Heat will likely go from natural gas to LP bottle/wood (rural.) We clearly plan to clamp our budget down to help drive savings. I am also a hobbyist who plans to spend some brainpower on efficiency. The move wouldn't impact commuting costs as me and my wife drive opposite directions for work and both our current and intended location are between our respective points of work.

Right now we don't have a ton in savings ($10k), but our family is quickly outgrowing the condo and we need more space for the kids. It's really a condo area for single/childless professionals and retirees. Our plan would be to sell the house, move in with parents nearby for a short period to amass savings (aiming for about $25k-$35k down on the next property.)

The thought is that our condo was a first buy, to establish ourselves, we are now greatly in need of more space, and planning to spend at least 10+ years in the next location.

We want to consider doing this within the year, are we crazy and too impulsive? Life speeds up with children and we really want to find a location to invest in that we can consider a ""forever home"". We are invested in the state itself for the long term and have stable employment (though slightly limited in options for growth, we are ok with that).

Any input is appreciated!

personalfinance,Should I refinance my mortgage?,"As the title says I am trying to decide if I should refinance my mortgage. My wife and I bought our home in September 2013. At the time, I was just finishing graduate school and had an offer for the job I currently have. My wife was working as a nurse full-time. Even with my first paycheck we were still quite cash poor but wanted to buy our first home right ahead of our wedding. We qualified for an FHA loan with the following details which was great but due to not having a ton of cash to put down (only 10%), we ended up needing Mortgage Insurance. We ended up purchasing the home for $161,900 and got an interest rate of 4.25% over 30 years. Currently, we have an outstanding principle of $155,368 and are making monthly payments of $1,266 with mortgage insurance taking a nice 174 a month. My question is, is it worth it for me to refinance the house. According to Zillow (I know not a great estimate), our home has appreciated quite a bit since we purchase and the Zestimate is right at the $200k mark. Is it possible that if I refinanced my house that the home may have appraised high enough that I could get rid of the mortgage insurance I am currently paying for due to the equity in my house. Additionally, I assume I could potentially lower my monthly payment quite a bit. I know it seems really soon to refinance but was wondering if in this case it made any sense.

financialindependence,"[24M] with 57k student loan debt and 70k annual income. Should I max an IRA to reduce my 2014 taxable income, or use a slightly smaller tax return to pay down loans?","So I know that general order of personal finances is to match your employer's 401k, then create an emergency fund, followed by paying off debts starting with the highest interest accounts. Only then would you start investing for retirement outside of the employer matched 401k.  
  
My question is this: would I basically be throwing away money by NOT maxing an IRA (similar to throwing away money by not taking advantage of your employer match)? 

Some info for 2014:  

*  Annual income:				70,000  
*  Student loan debt:				57,000  
	- 34k federal loans at 6.8%, min payment of $430  
	- 7.8k private loans at 9.25%, min payment of $220 (paying $440)  
	- 15.5k personal loan to Dad at 0%, monthly payment of $150  
*  Current taxable income:			        59,000  
*  Taxable income after maxing IRA:		53,500  
*  Current estimated tax return:		         4,987  
*  Estimated tax return after maxing IRA:	 6,362  
*  Additional refund:				1,375 (25% of $5500)  
  
The biggest and really only downside that I see to doing this is that before, I was planning on diverting the entire $4987 into the highest interest loan, thereby cutting down the total future interest paid on that loan from ~$600 to ~80 (savings of $520). If I decide to fund an IRA, I will have to transfer $5500 from my savings into the IRA, locking up those funds. However, I'll still have a larger return of $6362. Of that, $5500 will replensih my savings, and the other $862 will go into the highest interest loan.  
  
So the way I see it is a net positive of $855. My current plan saves me $520, and opening an IRA saves me $1375, netting a difference of $855. Is there anything I'm missing, especially when thinking about the long term?

personalfinance,What would you do in my situation? Save money so I don't have to take out student loans or put that money into retirement?,"Hey there, going to try to give as much detail as possible to get some help from you fellow /r/pf enthusiasts.
 

Little recap: I went to a good 4 year state college right out of High School for Civil Engineering with no financial help from family so I had to take out student loans for tuition, supplies, rent, etc. So after 3 semesters, I had racked up about $35,000 in student loan debt and proceeded to drop out because the Engineering spark within me fizzled out and I had no idea what other major to choose. So I began working two labor jobs and living at home to start paying the minimums on my loans. Eventually, I got a job making $30,000 in the corporate world and, in 2 years, am now making close to $50,000. With using help from /r/pf, I started living frugally to minimize my debt and as of May 2014, I was completely debt free (such an amazing feeling!).

For the last year, I have been taking classes at a community college because I realized how important education and a degree are in cubicle land. I just completed a 2 year degree in Business Administration at a community college where classes were around $300 each, so I was able to easily pay out of pocket for them. 

I just turned 24 and I am now attending another 4 year college to get my bachelor's of Finance. Luckily all my credits transferred from CC so I only have two years of classes to take. However, each class is around $2,400 and I am planning to take 2-3 per semester (taking 3 classes this spring) so it's going to get expensive.

Which leads me to my question.. Do I save money in order to not go back into debt by paying tuition in cash each semester or should I contribute more to retirement? I have an irrational fear of debt now, as most people who were once quite a bit in the red are I'm sure, so not taking out loans would be an emotional win. However, I know I'm young and compounding interest is best when taken advantage of early. Please share your thoughts on what you would do in this situation!



More details:

I contribute 15% of my gross income to a non-matched 401K (2055 retirement fund with Vanguard).

I max out my Roth IRA with Vanguard over the course of the year (about $500 per month) and have for the past 2 years.

This is about 22% of my salary currently going into retirement.



My monthly expenses are low including:

* Rent (including utilities + netflix): $365
* Auto Insurance: $75
* Cell Phone: $50
* Gym: $30
* Entertainment/Food: $400 (mainly in food)

I bring in roughly $1,250 after taxes and deductions each paycheck so that leaves me with $1,580 left over each month ($1,080 after IRA). So I can pretty much pay for 1 class every two months which means I can safely pay for roughly 6 classes per year without taking on anymore debt.

The problem with ACA is single fathers like me who pay in full for their children to live at their mothers and pay to live at dads can't freaking afford ACA with my income. 

I have looked at the requirements for exemption and none apply to me. I can't seem to find any special requests for exemption.

I'm in debt 30,000$ for fighting custody of my boy. I have already cut my expenses to the very bare minimum and I still can't afford more then 25$ a month to pay off the 30,000$ loan but I'm expected to dish out an extra 275$ a month.

My budget is so beyond tight that if I go over 5$ on any of my budgets I'm in the red. I don't even have budgets for things like car repairs or if I need new tires because I can't afford to budget shit like that.

I'm so beyond stressed out and feel betrayed as someone who is a huge supporter of ACA watching it come back to fuck me up. 

I'm ranting because I seriously don't know how I'm going to get through this year let alone the next.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: #1

I can't move closer to my job my son lives and goes to school in this city.

As of right now I cannot have a roommate or find a small apartment because I am going through a custody battle and being evaluated.

I don't have Netflix or any other service like that to be cut.

200$a month  is car gas not heating gas.

Yes I can quit my brewing job for a construction job, I'll make about the same amount of money with twice the hours.

A lot of assumptions are being made about my living situation. Assumptions some of my family doesn't even know but reddit seems to know.

------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT #2-You know this started out as a nice conversation with very helpful people giving me good ideas on how to save and or make more money. Its has turned into a nasty one filled with hurtful comments and idiots that apparently know more about my living situation then I do. I seriously would never assume so much about something I could never know. Im going to stop responding to most comments. I really do appreciate those who did help, I think I may have found a way to make an extra 200$ a month by a helpful suggestion.


Also I did not vote for Obama or for Mitt for that matter. Not sure why this has to be political. Im also not sure why the ACA is apparently my fault. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit #3- Jesus Christ some of you are crazy, I had no idea reddit was like this. There have been two very generous offers to buy my son a gift for his birthday and another to pay my insurance for an entire year. The other lot of you just keep spouting terrible things.

Just some clarification about my rent. Rent is 850$ a month I say just over 900 because water, sewer and garbage is tacked onto rent every month.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit#4- My budget, sorry should have posted this a long time ago:

I have 1900$ to spend every month after child support and taxes.

940$-Rent

150$-Car Payment

175$-Food for 2 


75$-phone and Internet 


75$-electricity 


200$-Car gas 


10$-entertainment (I usually take my son to Wunderland once a month with this money)


10$-clothes 


10$-pets 


75$-unpaid medical bills


45$-shopping (paper towels, soap, anything that needs replaced like dishes etc.) 


20$-Eating out 


70$-insurance


This usually leaves 45$ for when I make a mistake and go over on my budget and or something comes up like buying a present for my sons birthday this month.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit #5- There seems to be a lot for confusion about the child custody battle. I can't simply loose or give up the custody battle to save money and if anyone here were in my situation you would never mention such a thing and here's why.

I was raised a Jehovahs Witness and married young as all Jw's do. When my son was in his mothers womb I realized I was in a cult and stop going so my wife left me for this reason. The Jw's follow extreme doctrines like a harsh shunning policy so there members do not associate with people out side the cult even if its your family. I haven't spoken to any of my family thats still left in the church (4 members left with me) for over 5 years. My own sister being one of them, my wife all my grandpas and grandmas, aunts, uncles, niece and nephews and all my friends from growing up have completely cut off all contact with me. 

If you have ever experienced loss on that scale you would understand why there isn't anything I would not do to save my son from being indoctrinated into that bullshit and in turn shunning his daddy. I cannon't afford to loose anyone else, especially my son. So please stop making those comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit #6- Since when does not being able to afford insurance mean that my son should be removed from my custody? He is well fed and clothed, I provide everything he needs not his mother. Who by the way makes around 12K a year so by some of reddit's logic I should win simply because I have more money. I can afford everything my son needs I just can't afford fucking insurance which puts me in the same boat as 40 million other fucking Americans before ACA. Really? take my son away because I only make 40K a year? Fuck you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Edit #7- Thanks for everyones support. I seriously had no idea this was going to blow up like it did, I was just ranting this morning looking for a way to afford the ACA after finding out the penalties while doing my taxes. Had no idea I would be spending all day responding to comments. 


A lot of you not much better off then I am have offered kind words and support. This especially means a lot when it comes to the custody battle for my son. Ill be thinking of what you said when going to trial. Edit #6 was blunt I know, but geezus christ reddit.

personalfinance,Which Home Loan would be best for my situation?,"Hello All,

So I have about $40-50k saved up to buy a house and I am looking at some that are around the $200-250k range. I plan on buying a house with a 20% down payment after all closing costs, realtor costs etc. are accounted for. I have above a 700 credit score and my wife at worst has 600, but she should be close to 700 at this point... I hope. (She defaulted on a credit card back during college, but that was over 7 years ago. Since then she has had no credit issues.) Combined we make about ~100k a year, we have no kids yet. 

My question is what would be the most optimal loan for me to take out for my situation?

I have seen one loan posted on here a long time ago that was a 15 year loan at some outrageously low interest rate, something like 0.2% if I remember correctly, and that looked attractive if we could get it. I just forget what kind of loan it was and if it still exists. 

I am sure I would have many other options and just want to know the best route to take. Not sure if it matters, but I also own a construction company so any house I buy would be a fixer upper, that I would be able to fix for pretty cheap. Not sure if that would change anything though. 

So any advice you can offer will be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"[24M] with 57k student loan debt and 70k annual income. Should I max an IRA to reduce my 2014 taxable income, or use a slightly smaller tax return to pay down loans?","So I know that general order of personal finances is to match your employer's 401k, then create an emergency fund, followed by paying off debts starting with the highest interest accounts. Only then would you start investing for retirement outside of the employer matched 401k.  
  
My question is this: would I basically be throwing away money by NOT maxing a (edit add: traditional) IRA (similar to throwing away money by not taking advantage of your employer match)? 

Some info for 2014:  

*  Annual income:				70,000  
*  Student loan debt:				57,000  
	- 34k federal loans at 6.8%, min payment of $430  
	- 7.8k private loans at 9.25%, min payment of $220 (paying $440)  
	- 15.5k personal loan to Dad at 0%, monthly payment of $150  
*  Current taxable income:			        59,000  
*  Taxable income after maxing IRA:		53,500  
*  Current estimated tax return:		         4,987  
*  Estimated tax return after maxing IRA:	 6,362  
*  Additional refund:				1,375 (25% of $5500)  
  
The biggest and really only downside that I see to doing this is that before, I was planning on diverting the entire $4987 into the highest interest loan, thereby cutting down the total future interest paid on that loan from ~$600 to ~80 (savings of $520). If I decide to fund an IRA, I will have to transfer $5500 from my savings into the IRA, locking up those funds. However, I'll still have a larger return of $6362. Of that, $5500 will replensih my savings, and the other $862 will go into the highest interest loan.  
  
So the way I see it is a net positive of $855. My current plan saves me $520, and opening an IRA saves me $1375, netting a difference of $855. Is there anything I'm missing, especially when thinking about the long term?  
  
Also...I already know that I should probably fix my exemptions so I get the correct amount of taxes deducted from my paychecks.",finance,1421871532
personalfinance,Getting a better credit card interest rate,"I'm in a place where I'm hoping to really start putting a dent in my debt in the near future, and I'm sure many of you know that every little bit helps. I'm wondering if anyone has advice for dealing with getting relief on credit card interest rates. I currently have three credit cards with a balance (one has a 15.99% interest rate, one has 14.24% and the other is currently in a 0% promo phase -- the 0% one will be paid off the month before the promo runs out). 

For the 15.99% one, I have called the lender and requested a lower rate, and they declined. I have not attempted this for the 14.24% one. The card with the highest rate is also the one I owe the most on, so it would be helpful to get a lower rate, if possible, in order to allow more of my payments to go toward the principle rather than paying so much toward the interest every month.

Some ideas I have considered: A balance transfer to a card with a 0% introductory rate and a lower APR (which would be contingent on approval); a personal loan for the majority of the debt (again, would be contingent on approval); borrowing against our car that will be paid off next month (not ideal); or just sucking it up and paying the extra interest.

My credit score (depending on which reporting bureau you look at) is in the high 600s or low to mid-700s. I'm definitely not going to run out and apply for a bunch of different credit cards to get a better interest rate (because I definitely don't want to tank my score), so if any of you personal finance gurus have any advice, please send it my way.",finance,1421872387

personalfinance,[Ca] Looking for (investment?) advice,"Hello /personalfinance, thank you in advance for taking the time to read through this!

As far as background info goes I'm 26 and I'll have been working for 5 years come July at a hospital in the city of Montreal, Quebec. I earn roughly 45,000$ a year and can expect to cap out at 55,000$ on year twelve. I got married last summer and my wife earns roughly the same amount but can expect to cap out somewhere closer to ~ 65,000$. 

We're both very frugal, save the majority of our disposable income, and have relatively low fixed costs. We both had the good fortune to be living with our parents before being married. 

Quick breakdown of our financial situation:

Debts - none

Assets - car (paid cash)

Savings - Roughly 150,000$.  

Close to 100k of that is invested in various gold and precious metals related stocks / ETF'S distributed accross a maxed out RRSP and TFSA, the rest in a regular direct investment account. These investments are faring rather terribly at the present time :( The remaining ~50k is cash. My wife's RRSP has some contribution room from when she worked part time as a student + another 11k of TFSA for the both of us combined with the new year.

Short term goals are to buy a home (we currently rent for a very good price) and start a family. 

Short term - longer term goal is to start investing in broadly diversified Index funds aiming for market returns and compounding. If I could go back in time I would have done this from the beginning and avoided gold all together.

I'd like to start putting the 50k cash to work and generate some returns. I hate knowing I'm losing purchasing power every day due to inflation and getting a pittance for it in a ""high"" interest savings account. However that being said I'm also extremely fearful for what may happen to the markets. There's a reason why I invested so heavily into gold and the US is basically at an all time high. The BoC also just announced they cut interest rates 25 basis points. 

The logical argument I think at that point would be to buy a home and capitalize on low interest rates and put as much money down on a ~ 15 year mortgage. Unfortunately housing costs in Montreal are pretty fucked up, not Toronto or Vancouver fucked up - but it's not great either. For example we would most likely purchase a Duplex in an ""inexpensive"" part of town which go for around ~ 450,000$.

My wife and I have been increasingly discussing the possibility of moving somewhere where the cost of living would make more sense (while paying less taxes and earning higher salaries). This is a decision that will not easily be made however given our family ties with Montreal and our wanting to have children soon.

Assuming we don't move, what do you guys think is the best course of action regarding our current financial situation and what to do with our savings. Buy a home or keep renting? Hope for a RE crash that hasn't come in the last ten years and may never come? Invest in the market and hope the market doesn't crash due to general economic malaise? Don't invest and watch our savings get eaten up by inflation?

I feel like nothing makes sense and it pisses me off. Although I should be ecstatic that I have no debt and decent savings if I want to become a homeowner it seems like I need to become a slave to the system working my life away just to pay off the ridiculous price tag. I have all this money I want to invest but it seems like the financial markets make even less sense and with the artificially low interest rates I'm just getting burned that much harder.

TLDR: Have money, unsure what to do with it. Housing prices high, market irrational, interest rates low and high inflation. Welp.",finance,1421876581
personalfinance,Complicated Rental Income Question.,"I'm in a sort of unique tax situation and I'm not quite sure how to file my taxes.


For the past few years I've filed my taxes through my parents with someone they've been using for the last 10 years or so. But as I am getting older I want to figure it out for myself so I can be more self reliant.


Location: California


Situation: In 2009 I bought a house with money from my parents. The house was purchased 100% under my name alone so I could qualify for Obama's first time home buyer's credit ($8k or so). We purchased the property out right with cash cause my parents got a loan in another country that had better rates (they have dual citizenship). 

For the first three years I lived in the property and rented out the bedrooms to other college students and forwarded the money to my parents for the mortgage. But about 2 years ago I moved out and decided I didn't want to be a landlord so I hired a property management to rent out the place completely.

The monthly rent is $2k after they property management takes their cut. Pretty much all the money goes straight to my parents for the mortgage but I keep about $400/month for property taxes. Two years ago I deposited 5 of the checks while my parents deposited the other 7. For 2013 I talked with my parent's tax person and claimed $10k of additional income for the money I deposited. But we didn't state where the income came from. I'm not sure if my parents paid any tax on the other $14k. I was originally supposed to get about $800 refunded from my state and federal taxes combined but because of the extra income I had to pay out $300. This year I didn't deposit any of checks. My parents deposited all the check and sent me $400/m for the property taxes. So I'm trying to figure out my own taxes I need to determine if

1) Do I need to claim $4,800 from my parents as income or would it be considered a gift?

2) Do I need to claim all $24k income under my name and end up paying $1-2k of taxes out of pocket? 

3) Would my parents be the ones that are required to claim the $24k since they deposited all the checks?

Another note: The property manager that I use was referred to us by a friend of my parents. They handle 2 or 3 properties for that person and they said that the company doesn't report any of the rental income so they never even report of it on their taxes. They've been doing it for 5+ years now. 

My income right now is about $31k so this income makes a huge difference in how much I end up owing. Anyone have any advice. Morally I feel that I should be paying the taxes but financially I can barely cover myself right now with the additional property taxes. I've been on this subreddit for the past few months and you guys have been really helpful already!",finance,1421876590
personalfinance,Getting married: Questions about combining very different finances and how to prioritize,"Hi /r/personalfinance! I hope you can help us out.

Him:  

Annual Income: 185k annual salary (take home of 4,200 every other week) with likely year end (December 2015) bonus of around 40k; anticipate raise to 210k annual salary in 2016  
Rental Income:  $1,300 per month (but see note re utilities below)  
  
Savings/emergency fund:  35k  
Retirement: not currently saving; no employer match for 401k  
  
Debt:    
Mortgage:  574k on home worth about 610k; annual interest of rate of 3.75% plus PMI (~$600 per month); all in monthly payment including escrow (taxes, PMI and other insurance)  is $3,800  
Student Loans: 180k at a weighted average interest rate of 6.7%; currently monthly payment is 1,500; loans held by department of ed  
No other debts  
  
Expected One Time Expenses:  
  
About 10k of work to the house in the next year  
Car insurance about 1k per year (car is paid off)  
  
Other Monthly Expenses:  
  
Utilities on house and tenant's unit: $500  
Food:  $500  
other monthly expenses, including clothes, entertainment, transportation, etc:  varies a lot, but probably need a minimum of $1,000 per month  
  
Her (in school full time, employed part time):  
Annual Income: varies due to contract employment. Currently have $7000  from a lump-sum payment to last until July 1 when I'll be paid another $3700. I have no idea how much, if any, money I will make for the rest of the year after that. Next year will be similar.  
  
Savings/emergency fund: $1100  
retirement: $4775, No employer match. 5% of post-tax income goes into a Roth IRA.   
  
Student loans: $16k at 6.8% interest. Currently pay $65/month towards them, which is the unsubsidized interest that accrues.  
personal loan: $1100 at 7.9%. Currently pay $125/month towards this.   
  
Monthly expenses: $1275 (budgeted, sometimes spend less and save the rest, rarely exceed it).  
  
So, /r/personalfinance, how should we prioritize? Does it make sense to pay down PMI? or student loans? Should we be thinking about investing? For what it is worth, we live in a major city so many of these costs are pretty fixed... I don't think I could possibly budget less than I already am.  We also need to purchase a second (used) car at some point in 2016.

personalfinance,Can someone explain to my why this wouldn't work?,"I had a little shower thought the other day about taking out 10 loans of £100,000 each and then putting it in a high interest rate account of at least 1% per month. This means you are essentially making £10,000 per month or £120,000 after a year. Paying back the loans over 10 years costs approximately £100,000 per year. This leads to a profit of approximately £20,000 per year. This all seems very far fetched and as someone with little knowledge on the topic seems very likely to succeed.

personalfinance,99% sure my bank overcharged me in interest fees. Is this common?,"NOTE: If you don't want to read all the mundane details regarding the math, skip to the bottom paragraph

I typically pay off my credit card every month but after a bad run at the casino last month I had to carry a bit of a balance this month. My charge for my December cycle was $2,663. I put $2,000 towards it, leaving me with $663 to be charged interest on. Given that my CC interest rate is 8.15%, I calculated it to be about $4.50. No big deal.

So I get my finance charge and it's almost $15. Now by no means am I one to make a huge fuss over ~$10, but I wanted to make sure I understood how the math worked so going forward I can make more educated decisions about how much money I'm comfortable with being charged interest. I called up my bank and after putting me on hold for 20 minutes they came back and said it indeed didn't add up, but they're seeing that they should have actually charged me more....about $18. They said however that they needed to have some other individual have the final say and they took my number so she could call me back.

After hanging up I thought that was odd, so I got my calculator out. It turns out that they were doing the math with my full ($2.663x.0815)/12, which is about $18. If they would have factored in the fact that I put $2,000 towards it, it would have been ($663x.0815)/12, which is $4.50.

How does something like this happen? I would think that these interest charges would be calculated by an algorithm and errors like this wouldn't happen. Is this just a common mistake or do you think they may have been being shady? I'd love to know a little bit more about how this process works. Thanks!",finance,1421877195
personalfinance,You Should Know How to Report Fraud on Your Credit Card,"We are seeing a lot of posts about credit card fraud lately. I want to clear up some misconceptions and clarify the rights you have as a credit card consumer.

Here is what to do if you see fraudulent charges on your card. Make sure you document every step, and keep good records.

1. Report the fraud to the issuer immediately, and cancel the card. Fraud liability is time-dependent, so do this ASAP. Do not ""dispute"" the transaction. Transactions are ""disputed"" when a merchant fails to deliver goods or services as described or incorrectly bills you after an authorization has been previously given. You want to ""report the transaction as fraudulent."" The bank will open a case and send you forms in the mail to fill out.

2. File a police report. Do it. Seriously. Immediately. This shows the bank that you're serious about the transaction being fraudulent. It shows the action is less likely to be you trying to scam the bank out of money. If that were the case, now you'd be filing a false police report (a criminal offense) in addition to committing financial fraud.

3. When you get the forms from the bank, fill them out, make copies for your records, and send them back via certified mail with return receipt requested. Don't procrastinate.

4. The bank should issue you a provisional credit so that you don't have to pay for the fraud. Watch your account for this. Call them every few days about it if you don't see it show up.

5. After awhile (typically no longer than 90 days), the dispute is closed and you are off the hook, HOWEVER...if the bank denies your fraud claim (after you've called them repeatedly and asked them to re-examine it) and tries to hold you liable for the fraudulent purchase:

6. File a complaint with [the Federal Trade Commision](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0341-file-complaint-ftc).

7. File a complaint with [the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](https://appsec.helpwithmybank.gov/olcc_form/).

8. File a complaint with [the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint).

9. File a complaint with your state's financial corporation regulator. Here are a few examples:

MD - [Commissioner of Financial Regulation](http://www.dllr.state.md.us/finance/)

NY - [Department of Financial Services](http://www.dfs.ny.gov/)

FL - [Florida Office of Financial Regulation](http://www.flofr.com/StaticPages/FileAComplaint.htm)

CA - [Dept of Business Oversight](http://www.dbo.ca.gov/)

Make sure you include your detailed record (you remembered to document everything, right?), police report, copy of your fraud claim that you sent to the bank, and copy of your statement showing the fraudulent charge.

---------------

Here are some rules you should know:

Federal law limits fraud liability to $50. If you have reported a transaction as fraud in a timely manner (typically less than 60 days), you CANNOT legally be held liable for more than $50 unless it is proven that you or an authorized user actually made the purchase. Visa and Mastercard both have ""Zero Liability"" provisions which prevent you from being liable for any fraudulent purchase committed on cards branded with their mark (except under certain circumstances which are vague).

Regarding debit cards: Federal law limits your liability to $50 provided you report the fraud within 2 days. Then, the liability limit increases to $500 if reported within 60 days after your statement is sent to you.

So to the reason for the post, I was wondering if I should buy a home or aggressively pay off my student loans? I live in an expensive area, and the prices for homes/apartments have been crazy high, and I don't see them slowing down anytime soon (think SF, NYC). Also, mortgage rates are *very* low at the moment. 

I personally don't think it would be worth it to pay rent at minimum $1,000/mo in a undersized shitty apartment when I could at least purchase a home and pay a little bit more for mortgage, but have something bigger, etc...

Would this be wise? Or should I stay away from home buying at all and just pay off my loans?

personalfinance,Pay off your mortgage earlier without making extra money.,"This is directed at new homeowners just getting started in life but could be useful for those not already taking the necessary actions to use their money to make more money.

Here is a Simple Savings Strategy that anyone can do to pay off their mortgage a little bit earlier and save tens of thousands of dollars.

Take a look at your insurance carriers for your Home and Auto insurance.

Are these companies advertising a lot on television?

If so you can likely find another policy with the same coverage elsewhere for A LOT lower price.

You can use those savings to pay on extra principal payments towards your mortgage.

You will save on interest payments on the backend of your mortgage, and you won't have to put as much money towards your insurance expenses.

Depending on how much longer you have to pay on your mortgage, and your interest rates, these savings can add up into the tens of thousands of dollars.

Of course you can pay down the mortgage faster by bringing in extra money or cutting out other expenses, but getting savings on everyday expenses like insurance, cell phone service, and TV/Cable services can add up to some BIG savings for you.

Again this is a simple, simple way to set you and your family up for a more secure future without the added benefit of making more money.

Look up an insurance broker that doesn't charge fees for their services to see what they have to offer.

I work in insurance out here in California, and I see the differences between insurance rates on a daily basis.  Your savings can be staggering if you are overpaying right now.

A few moments of consideration can really help your future.",finance,1421884310
personalfinance,How can I get overdraft fees refunded?,"Hi, thanks if your reading this and trying to help. Let me start with my job, I am an Advanced EMT, I work in EMS, so I don't make a lot of money. Also I am a student, I go back to school next week and will leave where I'm working to go back to school again, so no more paychecks and living off pell grant, scholarships, and federal loans. 

Well let me start with the event that caused the overdraft fees, I had a Sirius radio payment come out of my account last week on the 12th, I completely spaced this out! I feel terrible, it only comes out every six months. It was about $157, I had $99 in my account, this caused me to be over drafted. I did not notice this, I was busy that day, I worked the day shift. In EMS sometimes we live off gas station products, so I stopped there 3 times that day, each time buying a coffee and a protein bar, or something or other. I covered for a co worker that night for half the night shift, so I got home after my 18 hour shift, woke up that morning and went to work. I purchased 3 more things at the gas station, 3 more overdraft fees. I also had a Cabellas payment come out, two actually, one $19.99 charge, and a separate shipping charge of $5.99, more overdraft fees. I got home that night and checked my account like I usually do on my phone, realized I was over drafted, immediately called my bank at 6. I have 8 overdraft fees at this point, $288 dollars in fees! 

I explained everything as I just did to the bank lady, and she informed me the branch manager would be the one who could refund overdraft fees and would be in tomorrow. I called the next day, another lady informed me that the branch manager would not be able to do anything until I had a positive balance, I said okay I will have to wait until I get paid next week on the 21st and will call then. 

Fast forward to today, I deposited my check for $900 dollars, and this is from quite a bit of overtime hours that I was able to pick up, usually I make $600 every two weeks. Also today I was given a $25 dollar extended overdraft fee, great great thank you US Bank. I called my bank, I asked for the branch manager and the lady informed me that she was sick and wouldn't be in until next Monday, she then asked if there was anything she could help with. I said, ""I'll explain the situation and hopefully you can."" I proceeded to explain exactly as I have it laid out above (I have a notepad to follow). She said to hold and would speak with another person, she came back after a few minutes and said she would be able to refund the $25 dollar extended overdraft fee, I said thank you. She also informed me that the branch would not be able to refund those 8 overdraft fees because I was opted in, which I still don't really know exactly what that is. I said I'll just call the branch manager next week and thanked her for the $25 refunded anyways. 

I read an article before I talked to bank today that said to make it hard for bank to say no to refund. Such as saying, ""Are you sure?"" ""Is there anything else you can do?"" Her responses were, ""Yes I'm sure"" ""No there's nothing I can do more.""

I really need help guys, I need money to pay for apartment, utility bills, truck payment, and pay for my text books. I can't afford almost $300 in fees. I just feel terrible, almost sick because my $1 dollar cup of coffee and protein bars that originally came up to maybe $6 bucks are costing me a little over $40 bucks!",finance,1421884907

personalfinance,"Partial pay-off of loan/CC debt of ~$12k @ ~$220/mo or full pay-off of medical debt of ~$2,600 @ ~$370/mo with tax refund","**Edit:** math, grammar, spelling, structure, mistakes from rambling

My wife and I are in the process of creating a budget and we're of differing minds about how to use our expected Federal tax refund.

Our debt situation is:

* Credit Card: $6k @ ~6% @ $125/mo (above minimum payment and not making purchases with this account again ever)
* Student Loan: $6k @ ~5.8% @ $94/mo (fixed payments)
* Hospital 1: $1.1k @ $150/mo (payment plan)
* Hospital 2a: $1k @ $150/mo (payment plan)
* Hospital 2b: ??? (waiting on insurance mix-up to be resolved; &gt; $1k?)
* Hospital 3: $500 @ $65/mo (no plan, just paying)

We have one income (mine) and I just got my W2s yesterday. Our estimated refund, using online tax calculators, would be enough to pay off the listed medical bills with some left over or enough to pay about half of either the loan or the credit card.

The first three years after our son was born we spent about $38k out of pocket for medical expenses (the first year was $15k) and with continued doctor visits over the years and with changes in the prices of necessities (gas, bread, clothing, etc) things seem to have gotten tighter and tighter as the years have progressed. In March of 2014 we took my son to the hospital for RSV; his first visit he was sent home, his second (3 days later) he was admitted. The first visit was covered by insurance (ER only), the second, our insurance company said GFY;YOYO and we had to pay the entirety of the $4,300 bill. And here we are again in RSV season...

I told you that story so I could tell you this one:

Freeing up cash by paying off medical bills and sparing those funds from being locked up in continual debt repayment has been my stance after our son was born. I've come to this position on the basis of ""there's always another high-priced doctor visit or CT or ECG or sonogram right around the corner""; if we'd paid off the non-medical debt, we'd've been sunk by all the fresh hospital bills. For better or worse I believe we've been able to avoid having to take out any **more** debt to ""stay afloat"". My wife would like to take this year's expected refund and pay down the student loan or credit card knowing, of course, that there is interest accruing on both - the longer you take to pay them off the more you end up paying. I certainly understand what she's thinking.

However, what I cannot get out of my mind is that by partially paying down the CC/loan debt we'll still **have** to pay the minimum of around $584 for the next 7 months and wouldn't have improved our cash flow. Over time we'll pay less, quite a bit, I'm sure, but I can't shake the feeling that there's always another expensive trip to the hospital right around the corner. Our emergency fund is a wreck and what savings we did have is almost gone. Not having a budget (and poor leadership {i.e.: **me**}) may be largely to blame, but the constant high-price medical treatments have been killing us for almost 4 years. I'm paranoid if we give up flexibility by paying down the debts we're going to be in a world of hurt by the time the medical bills are paid off in 7 months.

Am I up a tree on this? Should we pay down the CC/Loan debt and pay less overall, but worry we're going to be completely tapped in 7 months? Or should we keep the assets free by paying off the medical bills, rebuilding our shambles of an emergency fund, and allocating the now undedicated extra funds towards the CC/Loan debt? I feel like I should be following an avalanche or snowball plan, but with the way things are nowadays, I can't shake that not tying up funds if you don't have to will continue to keep us from a world of hurt.

I'm starting to ramble; I'll leave it at that.

Thanks in advance!",finance,1421885542
personalfinance,"Condo mortgage underwater, need to sell, what do I do?","I bought a condo in NJ a little over 5 years ago for $225K and have since moved for work.  I have paid down the principle to just under $200K but the market price for the condo is between $175-160K now.  I have a tenant there currently, but lose over $600 per month due to the cost of the mortgage and association fees not being covered by their rent.  I've had enough of throwing this money away and want to be rid of the condo but I don't know what to do next.  

I have started contacting a realtor who is helping.  I also contacted my mortgage company about if there is any support they can provide (short sale or deed in lieu were the two options and I am planning to go ahead with a formal request but don't want the negative impact on my credit).  I think I can pay down the mortgage to about $180K but it'll eat up my yearly bonus, all my savings, and I would need to make some payments to the mortgage using a credit card (planning on using chargesmart.com but don't really trust them all that much).  

I'm thinking I have a few options.  First is to get another credit card and use that to further pay down the mortgage to a point where I'm not underwater.  Second is to get a personal loan, but I'm not thrilled with the high interest rates I'd be paying on it.  Third is hoping for the short-sale or deed in lieu from the bank but I'm not really counting on much help there because I do make decent money and wouldn't expect to get that kind of help.

Wondering if I could get a sanity check by some of the people with a bit more experience in finances than me.

We're going to go off of a paycheck where I've worked ~84 Hours over 2 weeks.
Health, vision, dental, disability and 401k are all taken out between gross and net.
Gross: 3434.88 Net: 2168.55 I'll take out 4 gross hours and go with 2k Net per pay check.

I currently have 64k In student loan debt, 32k of that is at 0% interest (thanks Mum and Dad!) the rest varies between 2% and 6.55% divided into about 9 loans.

I have 3k In emergency funds, nearly 5k for a down payment on a new car. 730-750 credit core

My current budget / Plan

$203.01/Month Min SL payment Private loan (2%)

$235.17/Month Min SL Payment for Federal Loan

$1,000/Month 0% Loan Minimum

$1,000/Month To highest interest Loan with the smallest balance

$675/Month Rent

$264.07/Month Car Insurance

$237.51/Month Car Payment (Leased, turning in shortly)

$65/Month Gym

$50/Month Phone

$50/Month Gas

$350/Month Food / Eating out

($25/Week Investment) x 4 ~ $110 / Month

Total: 4,239.76

So absolute worst case, I'm down maybe ~240 a month.

Now I need a replacement for my Car which is a lease and is about to be turned in. The Car I plan on purchasing will be about $400-500 a month (60 month financed) after my down payment, and my insurance will stay about the same. I've already purchased new all season tires for the car which cost me about ~650, The car comes with summer tires which I plan on selling ASAP looking for around 300-400 for the new tires sold.

I plan on Driving this car for a very long time.

So, some food for thought: I Regularly work more than 40 hours a week, sometimes up to 60 hours infrequently, but 43-48 hours are normal. Also I travel several times a year for work where all my living expenses are paid for. Plus I can make a bit more by banking the per-diem.

I'm also expecting a tax return, not quite sure the amount.

The thing thats about to change is the car, is taking on the additional $170-270/Month too much when I have the student loans? Or will the new car and lack of repair payments outweigh this additional cost?

Is Spending ~2400/month on loans excessive?

Forex,ITT: I teach you how simple it is to trade Fundemental Analysis,"I did one for technical analysis, so here's one for fundemental analysis (here is the previous thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/2nc2dt/itt_i_teach_you_how_simple_it_is_to_make_money_in/ )

Steps:

1. Realize that Fundemental Analysis is extremely important to the success of a trader who trades the Daily and above timeframes. The goal is to make sure that the trend from TA lines up with the view from FA. (ie. Bullish FA + Bullish TA= success). 

2. Go to http://www.forexfactory.com/calendar.php to view all news events. Change the settings to show only [RED] expected impact. We mainly care about Inflation, Central Banks, and Speeches. Red just means high volatility upon release. 

3. The BIGGEST problem most people have with trading FA is that they think EVERY red news is important. That is FALSE. We mainly care about the Central Banks and what they do with any Stimulus, Interest Rates, and Inflation. These are the 3 holy grails for trading FA. The Central Bank are the ones who calls the shots. 

4. Go to www.investopedia.com and learn what Central banks montary statements, Quantiative Easing, Interest Rates, and Inflation really is. You want to know how the market reacts to a Quantiative easing, higher/lower intrest rates or inflation, ect ect ect. 

5. Every month or so, a country will release a statement that's given by the central bank. You will need to read these statements, and trust me it's not hard. It's only once a month for each currency for gods sakes. 
##Currency|BankName
#EUR: ECB
#USD: FOMC
#AUD: RBA
#NZD: RBNZ
#CAD: BOC
#JPY: BOJ
#GBP: BOE


6. Click on this image: http://prntscr.com/5vixoy . 
#The Red box is what you click on to bring down more information. 
#The Pink box is a basic outline of what that news event is. 
#The blue box is the important one. This is where 3rd party news articles about that news event is posted. (i prefer bloomberg and reuters). 
Click on any of them to read it. Notice that they fill up with 3rd party articles AFTER the news release (duh). 

7. The point isn't to trade before the central bank news release, but AFTERWARDS. You want to know what the central bank is thinking. An example: Doing a Quantitative easing will cause the value of a currency to fall, since USD did 3 quantitative easing in the past, this happened: http://prntscr.com/5tuebl . Notice how when the bank said they WILL do it soon, it caused a rally. We love these rallys. We make $$$ off this shit. 

8. So you basically want to read what they are saying and figure out which direction they are looking towards. Not every country is WANTING to increase the value of their currency. Some care more about inflation, interest rates, unemployment, ect. Reading the central bank statements will TELL YOU. Remember to always keep in mind that market sentiment WILL change based on economic data releases. Meaning if we know USD will be bullish, it's only once certainly bullish IF criteria is met. That criteria may be any of the economic indicators, and if they're NOT met, expect pullbacks. You can either trade these pullbacks (bit risky) or you can use them as opportunities to make trades toward the overall goal of the central bank (Buy USD in this case). Also, don't think that when a central bank says 'we want to increase interest rates in February.' means that they WILL do it in February. If the indicators aren't good, they won't increase it. 


9. Example: BOJ wants to issue a quantitative easing stimulus on 10-31-2014. So, Trebel decides to not use his indicators and decides to short JPY because he learned that doing a Quantiative easing stimulus causes the value of that currency to fall dramatically (not to mention Tecnical analysis says that the trend for JPY is bearish)! Trebel is now happy and can go chase some big booties with his money. 

10. Example 2: SilkyBrah decides to buy JPY because they had good unemployment numbers , but later he finds out he got margin called. WHY?! Because JPY doesn't care about their unemployment numbers like USA does, they care about something else. SilkyBrah will next time read the central bank statement to know what event is important for that country.

FHA Loan for $172k with $3k down ($175k original purchase price) in March 2013.  
3.25% interest rate  
Payments : $320 Principle, $450 Interest, $175 MIP, $215 other escrow  
Current Loan amount : $165k  
Current Zestimate : $210k (I know not entirely accurate, but the only thing I have to go on)

At what point do MIP payments end? Is it after 5 years, or 20%? If 20% is there a way to have an appraisal done to show house value has increased to end MIP sooner? If the house were to appraise at $210k, Then I am already over 20% equity.

Is there any point in even looking at refinancing with my current rate?",finance,1421933869

**Some clarification of terms**
.

[Witholding tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withholding_tax)

A withholding tax, also called a retention tax, is a government requirement for the payer of an item of income to withhold or deduct tax from the payment, and pay that tax to the government. In most jurisdictions, withholding tax applies to employment income. Many jurisdictions also require withholding tax on payments of interest or dividends. In most jurisdictions, there are additional withholding tax obligations if the recipient of the income is resident in a different jurisdiction, and in those circumstances withholding tax sometimes applies to royalties, rent or even the sale of real estate. Governments use withholding tax as a means to combat tax evasion, and sometimes impose additional withholding tax requirements if the recipient has been delinquent in filing tax returns, or in industries where tax evasion is perceived to be common.

[Indirect tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_tax)

An indirect tax (such as sales tax, a specific tax, value added tax (VAT), or goods and services tax (GST)) is a tax collected by an intermediary (such as a retail store) from the person who bears the ultimate economic burden of the tax (such as the consumer). The intermediary later files a tax return and forwards the tax proceeds to government with the return. In this sense, the term indirect tax is contrasted with a direct tax which is collected directly by government from the persons (legal or natural) on which it is imposed. Some commentators have argued that ""a direct tax is one that cannot be shifted by the taxpayer to someone else, whereas an indirect tax can be.""

[Value-added tax (VAT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax)

value-added tax (VAT) or also goods and services tax (GST) is a form of consumption tax. From the perspective of the buyer, it is a tax on the purchase price. From that of the seller, it is a tax only on the value added to a product, material, or service, from an accounting point of view, by this stage of its manufacture or distribution. The manufacturer remits to the government the difference between these two amounts, and retains the rest for themselves to offset the taxes they had previously paid on the inputs.

The purpose of VAT is to generate tax revenues to the government similar to the corporate income tax or the personal income tax.

The value added to a product by or with a business is the sale price charged to its customer, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs. A VAT is like a sales tax in that ultimately only the end consumer is taxed. It differs from the sales tax in that, with the latter, the tax is collected and remitted to the government only once, at the point of purchase by the end consumer. With the VAT, collections, remittances to the government, and credits for taxes already paid occur each time a business in the supply chain purchases products.

**My takeaway**

I realize some of you might disagree with me on this... but we need to come together and create our own sovereign government and monetary policy; we need a virtual political economy built on direct democracy. This is the only way to combat the still emerging legislation and get the majority of the population on our side. I have every confidence we can do this with blockchain 2.0 technology.

Bitcoin,My biggest concern for bitcoin,"My biggest concern for bitcoin as 'the global currency of the future' is that the economic ideology of our governments oppose bitcoin and deflationary currencies. 

During the transition to a deflationary currency the following would happen:

1. a substantial reduction in all investment products (companies, bonds, ect.).
2. central banks could no longer change base interest rates

Explanation

1. With a currency that is increasing in value over time rather then decreasing there would be less of a risk-reward ratio for investing in companies and bonds.
2. Bitcoin being decentralised, central banks and governments would lose the power to set interest rates. This has allowed them to control economic growth and influences personal consumption. Banks would become part of the free-market again.


These are both functions that governments use. I don't have any answers but I have some questions.

* Is government economic intervention a net positive or net negative for humanity? 

* Would we have the same potential economic evolution without government influence? 
* Does rapid economic growth matter most? OR Are we sacrificing the progression of morality and humanity for increased economic prosperity?",cryptocurrency,1421947558
worldpolitics,CIA Advisor: 25-Year Depression is About to Strike America,"We’ve got another whistleblower in the CIA. But this time, it’s not the kind of report you might expect from the spy agency. Jim Rickards used to serve as an advisor for Financial Threat and Asymmetric Warfare. It’s a fancy name for strategy. How to use government tactics to influence global change. You might recognize his name. He’s the author of two best selling books: Currency Wars and The Death of Money. 

In a recent article, Rickards suggests the Federal Reserve is covering up a massive debt crisis. In fact, he says the same computer model he developed for the CIA to predict attacks around the world, that system “Project Prophecy” tells him that the Federal Reserve is doing what they can to keep the public “in the dark” about a 100 TRILLION dollar meltdown. A massive financial collapse. On his website, Rickards calls it an “unavoidable catastrophe.” 

During a recent radio interview, Rickards pointed to a recurring trend he found in the international Monetary System. 

Even though the Dollar is trading against the Euro at the highest point than at any time in the last ten years, Rickards still says there is room for concern. Especially because comparing currency to the Euro doesn’t mean the same thing as it once did. Other signs of cheap oil and a global economic slowdown point toward a coming crisis that could challenge the average American’s financial resolve. 

Historically, the Swiss franc has been one of the most stable currencies in the global markets. But just earlier this month, the Swiss central bank split apart from their currency ceiling with the Euro, sending it for a sharp nosedive. The Swiss central bankers and financial analysts clearly sense some kind of change in the wind, but right up until the announcement, they kept their cards very close to the vest. Several top European officials said they were very insulted that they didn’t even get so much as a heads up that such a dramatic change was coming. 

Now the Euro is plummeting, the Dollar isn’t very far behind, and the global markets are full of world leaders, nervously feeling each other out, and looking for solid ground in a global economy based unstable Fiat currencies. One thing is for certain - they're harvesting precious metals found INSIDE solid ground.

So just some more info on my situation and why I have a question. When i turned 14 and a half, I got my first job over the summer. Completely legit, work permits, paychecks and everything. I earned about $1800 the first summer, earning $1200 the following summer, and just under $1500 the after that. I also worked another summer after that, but only made around $500. I got paychecks, and on the stubs I had money reduced for State and Federal taxes, just like everyone else.

No, I'm a college student, and I don't have a job. I am on financial aid, and my family is low-income (thus me working at 14).

So, my question is do I have to file for taxes? I know that my parents filed me as a dependent before, but since last year they received no money for me. So, is it better for them to continue filing me as a dependent?

But most importantly, what happens to that money they took from my paychecks?

personalfinance,Need tax advice for student loans paid on someone's behalf.,"A little background:

I graduated college, fortunately got a good job with good pay. I took out student loans and my dad took out parent plus loans to pay the rest of my schooling. The parent plus loans make up the majority of the student loans that were taken out for me.

Personal loans: ~25k

Parent Plus loans: ~55k



I've hit my loans and am now &lt;20k in one year. Cool, kind of irrelevant.

Now my dad has a job with less salary than I do now and cannot make payments on the parent plus loans because of mortgage, taxes, my brother's loans, etc. You know the story. So I'm being responsible and paying for the loans that were taken out for my schooling.

I've been making the minimum payments on these loans and occasionally try to add a little more which on average is about $650/month. This again is not a problem because I make enough to cover it.


Now it's tax season. And my dad is cool with me getting the tax return on whatever I paid on his behalf (because that's the right thing to do). Both my father and I called the loan company on separate instances (he has had some heated talks with them, so I wanted to get a perspective as well) and they seemed to have told him that I need to somehow get a 1099 form to claim the interest on payments I made on his behalf. I gave them a call and requested the form and they said there is no way they can split the amounts paid and it will all be under his name no matter what. Now I'm not really sure what to do. I don't want to talk to my dad right away because he'll just get agitated and say the company sucks and they're robbing us. Whatever. I need some outside advice about this. So I can explain it to him in a level-headed, informed way and we can work together to get this solved.

The main issue here is that in the same account is one of my brother's loans that my dad has been paying and they can't separate that for whatever reason (which is weird since payments are split by each specific loan). Is the 1099 form something I would get from the IRS or is it from the fedloan company? How would I got about claiming the interest paid with my income? (We have all of the statements so I can split it up manually, I just want to do this as legitimate as possible) Any advice would be appreciated though! Thanks.

I owe 225k (@ 3.875%) on my house currently, and it's ZEstimate is 550k (I'm going to round down to a 500k appraisal for math reasons).

Assuming I could get a 3.5-3.75% rate, what do you think about refinancing and pulling out 175k cash to use for investing?  I've been seeing 4.5-5% dividend returns on my municipal bond funds over the past year or so, which would be roughly a 1% advantage over what I could borrow at.

The ""upside"" of this is that the payments on the loan I'd be taking out are basically 100% mortgage interest and thus tax deductible (I'm in the 28% fed tax bracket + probably 10%'ish in California tax).  Similarly, my dividend gains from the bonds are tax exempt.  So I could flex tax advantage on both ends (increase my writeoffs on borrowing at 3.5-3.75%, and then not pay tax on investment returns @ 4.5-5%).

The biggest risk I see is the (likely) downturn in the bond funds once interest rates go up.

personalfinance,Thoughts on refinancing with or without rolling in credit card debt.,"I just got an email offer touting refinancing a mortgage to a 30-year fixed at 3.375%.  I had no idea rates were that low, but I ran some numbers and I wanted to see what this sub thought of them.

I'm currently 3+ years into a 30-year mortgage fixed at 4.125%.  The balance is just under $165k.  I bought the house for $250k in 2011 although I believe the value has gone down since then.

Also worth noting, in 2009 I was forced to take a 45% pay cut and suddenly my monthly expenses were twice my monthly take-home pay.  It took me 14 months to find a new job and 2 1/2 years to sell the house.  We ended up selling it for $30k less than we owed and bought our current house thanks to a 6-figure gift from my parents.  In the meantime I racked up over $50,000 in debt, mostly on a credit card, as I struggled to pay all of our bills.

Since we bought the house and I found my current job in late 2012 we've managed to put our lives back together.  Total debt is down to $34k, with $29k+ on a credit card and $4k+ on a home equity loan.  I've been using some balance transfer shenanigans to keep the credit card interest rate at 0% for the past 2 1/2 years.  That's ending in April so I'll have to do it again if I'm going to keep this up.  The home equity loan is locked to the prime rate.

Current payments:
$848.14 principle and interest
$485.15 escrow
$1333.29 total payment

Assuming I can get the advertised 3.375% (which I realize is a big if) and I refinanced only our current balance of $165k:
$729.46 + $485.15 = $1214.61 (-$118.68)

I have to say the idea of freeing up almost $120 a month is very appealing but then I thought about rolling some of the debt into the refinance.  If I just do the credit union loan I'll be borrowing $170k:
$751.56 + $485.15 = $1235.71

That's still -$97.58 per month and one of my debts is gone.

So, rolling ALL of my debt into the mortgage means I'd have to borrow $199k.  Now, that may not be possible because as I said the value of our house has gone down.  But assuming we can:
$879.77 + $485.15 = $1364.92

That's $31.63 per month more than we're paying now, but it would free up the $700 a month we currently have budgeted to paying off our debt.  Note that we have no emergency fund at this point so this money would go a long way.

I've heard people say you shouldn't roll credit card debt into a mortgage because then you're paying it off for the next 30 years, but I have to say after what I went through the thought of being debt free and having an extra $700 in my pocket every month is VERY appealing, even if it means I'm paying more over the course of the next 30 years.

Not very good but ive never missed a payment on anything, my only credit history is this car and perhaps some school loans. After I thwarted any attempt they made at trying to sell me a new car, they made attempt at a loan for my lease buyout.  The first rate was about 9% and claimed my credit score as the culprit. That was insane to me and told them id try my luck at the bank to which they replied, well try again.  The next rate 7.2%, still unhappy with a rate so high. They told to have my father cosign even though he has poor credit in order to see if his high income would possibly change things. Finance manager comes back says his credit is too bad and it wont help and I wont find a better interest rate than that anywhere else. My father and I decide to leave and test our luck at the bank, manager doesnt look happy I tell him ill give him a call this week.  Not even two minutes later he calls and tells me to come back, he got me approved for 3.7% which sounded pretty good but I couldnt help but feel like they're not being real with me.

personalfinance,Offset tax refund with a 401k contribution?,"Let's say I'm getting a $3000 ~~combined federal and~~ state tax refund from my 2014 taxes. 

That refund will count towards my taxable income on my 2015 tax return. 

http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi/ar01.html#d0e3228, Section ""Line 10 - Taxable Refunds, Credits, or Offsets of State and Local Income Taxes""
&gt; None of your refund is taxable if, in the year you paid the tax, you either (a) did not itemize deductions, or (b) elected to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.

This refund, received in 2014, was for tax paid in 2013 and I did itemize deductions for 2013 taxes. 

This refund to me is extra income, because I don't need it for my normal monthly expenses. So I'm trying  trying to think of options. 

In the past I would usually put this into my emergency fund or allocate it to some other longer term savings goal. 

What if I made an extra $3000 contribution to my 401k? (let's say in same month I get the refund).

Obviously my take home pay for the month will be less, but I've got the refund to cover the difference. (And $3k before tax will be less than $3k impact to my take home )

I'm thinking this approach would be a benefit to me by reducing my total taxable income for 2015, leading to less taxes owed (depending on where I end up in the brackets).  I also get more into my 401k, which I expect to get a better return then my savings over the long term. 

Am I missing anything from this analysis?

personalfinance,Financing an Out-of-State Home Purchase,"Total newb here. I've read some books but haven't seen anything discussing how to finance an out-of-state home purchase. All comments/suggestions are appreciated.

Situation is this: Live in WI. I'm a student, spouse works full-time. Gross income is ~$130k. We currently rent. In June, we move to NY (upstate, small city), where I will be employed and spouse will look for a job. Gross income will be ~200k (with spouse unemployed). We visit NY for a week in early April to look for housing. Our preference is to buy. We currently have $40k to put toward a downpayment and can save an additional $5k before our trip in April ($45k total) and an additional $15k before our move in June ($60k total). If we buy, our preference is to spend no more than $250k.

I haven't contacted a realtor/agent in NY yet, but my new company has a network and will be giving recommendations (they bring in people from out-of-state very regularly). I have a few questions.

1. Do we hire a mortgage broker in WI or in NY? Or does it not matter?
1. Assuming we want to leave the door open for a $250k property, what kind of leg work should we do before the April trip? Get pre-approval for an 80-10-10 loan? Get pre-qualified for a conventional mortgage equal to 80% of $250k? Ask family for a cash gift to get us to 20% of $250k and then get pre-approved for a conventional mortgage?
1. When should we initiate the appropriate mortgage pre-approval/pre-qualification process?
1. Just curious, would the interest rate on the ""80"" loan in an 80-10-10 situation differ substantially from that on a conventional mortgage?

By the way, both fica scores (TransUnion) are &gt; 760, if it matters. We will both be unemployed in June, so I assume we'd want to square away the mortgage before then (so we can show that we can cashflow).

personalfinance,Should I trade in my newer car for an older toy?,"In May of 2014 I bought a 2011 Honda Accord V6 Coupe loaded. At this point I'm about break-even. Not upside-down, but I don't have equity in it either. Car payments are not a huge deal, interest rate is just under 6%.

Recently, I saw a gorgeous '99 Trans Am (my dream car - go ahead and make fun!) for sale. Asking price is $4900 with 200k miles. I fell in love.

Currently, I'm in a position where I need to have a dependable car that I can drive a lot. However, in the middle of next month, I'm moving back to my hometown and taking a position that's within biking (walking even!) of where I'm living (it pays more, too!). Therefore, I won't really be using my fancy new car as much - maybe a couple of times a week to visit my mom 15 miles away or for other random things.

So basically, is it even worth it to keep this newer, more expensive car? Should I get rid of it and buy the gorgeous Trans Am, since I won't need to worry about it being super reliable? Or am I just being stupid here? Also, I should note that I don't have enough saved up to buy the Trans Am in cash, but the loan would be significantly smaller than my current loan.

To be clear: I am just comparing the option of keeping my newer fancier car to the option of getting rid of it and buying the Trans Am. PLEASE don't tell me to get rid of the Accord and buy a 10 year old fuel efficient car with low mileage. I'd much rather just keep the Accord.",finance,1421971360

This is the first time I've ever been given a choice on how my bonus is taxed. I'm already in the 25% federal tax range, and having my bonus added to my salary will not push me over that bracket.

I read the following two articles and it seems like the flat 25% rate is almost a no brainer for a one time bonus like this. However, the article mentions that your bonus + normal income combined would almost certainly push you to a higher tax rate. Since that's not the case for me, does it matter what I choose?

I have amassed about $12,500 credit card debt through past medical/dental/emergency charges, and I am looking to get rid of it once and for all. Interest rates are killing me, and it is just so demoralizing to put hundreds every month into a credit card payment, only to watch the balance barely move.

Yesterday, I logged onto my account and thought about looking into a personal loan as a means to consolidate my debt. I have not yet found out what kind of interest rates are on offer (will ask when I go deposit my paycheck today), or even if I qualify. So, the questions I have:

*Would using a personal loan to consolidate/better structure the reduction of my CC debt be a good decision?
(I feel like it would be because I will have a definite end date for my debt payoff, while with a CC I could be paying multiple hundred dollar min payments for the next 23 years)

*What would be a decent interest rate for a personal loan right now? 
(I'm in California, if that matters)

*Would it be smart to get the longest loan terms possible?
(I could request up to 72 months. My intention is not to pay the least in interest, but to be able to manage my payments. I currently pay out minimum almost $300 a month to my CC companies. I would like to keep any payment under this, or at the very least, close to it)

*Would it be better to try and apply for the loan alone, or would there be a benefit to applying with my wife? (We both have decent credit, about the same score)

Any advise would be helpful. I've only ever applied for a car loan, so I'm a bit ignorant ignorant uninformed when it comes to this kind of stuff (loans, debt consolidation, etc). I really just need a better plan that I can afford, and see an end to.

personalfinance,Lots of Debt - Best Plan/Tools/Advice? (CA),"Hello

I am 27, and I have recently graduated from University with a professional degree. My wife has been working as a professional for about 4 years. We earn a combined gross yearly income of about $130,000.

We have accumulated a lot of debt, and we want to pay it down. We also are just now starting our lives as professional [dinks](http://thesimplemoneyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DINK-267x300.png) (both 27, together for 10 years). We want to be able to enjoy our lives while being financially responsible.

We currently have one car, and I drive a scooter in the summer months (cheap, cheap!)

I will round numbers to simplify.

Loan/Debt | Amount Owing | Interest Rate
---|---|---
Bank Overdraft | 1300 | 18
Line of Credit | 28000 | 13.6
Credit Cards | 9500 | 12
Bank Loan | 2900 | 10.5
Line of Credit | 15000 | 5
Car Loan | 33000 | 5.5
Canada Student Loans | 37000 | 5.5
Alberta Student Loans |  19000 | 3

Totaling around $150,000 @ ~7.6% 
This means we are currently paying approximately **$950 per month in interest alone**.

Here is a rough estimate of our 'necessary' monthly expenses

Expense | Amount  
---|---
Rent | 1450
Utilities | 250 
Cell Phones | 115 
Insurance | 125 
Groceries | 600 
Gas | 150 
Pets | 100 
Public Transit | 100 
**Total** | 2890

So, with a net monthly income of about $7000, and current monthly interest of about $950, we have about $3000 left.

Our goal is to pay down the largest interest debts first, while making minimum payments on the rest.

Right now monetary policy is starting to diverge in the US and Europe/Japan. While the ECB is upping stimulus, the US is starting to pull out. This will obviously cause rates to drop in Europe/Japan, but rise in the US. Keep in mind the entire point of adding money to an economy is to encourage money to move around more quickly, stimulating economic growth. But as rates increase in the US and fall in places like Europe and Japan, I would suppose that the monies in Europe/Japan would expatriate to places with higher rates (and no higher risk) such as the US. Now the money that was supposed to circulate in struggling economies is leaving the struggling economies until interest rates even out between countries that are stimulating their economy and countries that are not.

Essentially the question is: can some of the more modern monetary policy practices work if the entire world is not united in their monetary policy decisions?

personalfinance,Questions about juggling credit card debt among cards with different interest rates,"Hi all- 

I could use some advice on how to manage my credit card debt among multiple cards to pay the least interest possible. 

Long story short, I had no other option but to put about $8000 on multiple credit cards to pay for school. Certainly not ideal, but it is what it is. Currently, I've got $4500 on a card with a 0% APR that switches to 20% in June. Haven't gotten the bill yet, but I'm expecting about a $120 minimum per month. The other $3500 is on a card with a 12% APR. Minimum will probably be around $70. I've also got a debt-free card with a 0% intro APR for 15 months with no fees or interest on balance transfers right now. After the 15 months, it goes to 12% APR. 

The first question is, how should I move balances around to pay the least interest possible long-term? Second, I can afford to pay $500 per month towards all this. After paying minimums, where should I put the extra?

I didn't have a lot of money to put down, so I put only 5% as down payment. The purchase value was $289000 and the loan was 274500.

I am currently paying $203.62 as PMI (because the down payment was less than 20%) and my monthly payment is $2155.87.


The interest rate I got was 4.5%, and recently I saw the interest rate drop so I contacted my credit union and they offered a 2nd mortgage and a refi on the first.

The deal is I would have 2 loans, one for 80% of the home, and another for the remainder, avoiding the need for a PMI and still getting a better interest rate on both loans. I don't have the numbers for that, but the first loan would be about ~230k (360 mo term) and the second about ~42k (180 mo term) at 3.6%.


What I do remember is that the payments would go down by $174, but there would be closing costs, which would take about 3 years to break even.

I want to know if refinancing a house early is wise, or if I should wait a while? I'm also aware that the 5% down payment was a tough call, but that was what we had to put down on our dream house, and stop renting for good. I also wonder if the interest rates are going down in a trend and if I should hold back for another moment.

personalfinance,HSA Concerns,"When I first started working I was enrolled in a HDHP and had access to an HSA. After a while the account built up to ~$1200. I never thought about using the HSA as a vehicle to save for retirement until recently but I fear it is too late.

Nearly a year ago my girlfriend at the time (wife now) found out she was pregnant. She is a student with basically no income, so her healthcare options were limited. There's no way she or I could comfortably cover the out of pocket costs of the prenatal visits and birth (haven't added it all up but it was easily &gt;$20k in total). Within a month of finding out we were married and I enrolled in the fanciest plan I could. I figured you never could predict what might go wrong with the birthing process. She was born at the end of the open enrollment season and so I decided to keep the expensive insurance for at least one more year. You can't predict how much will go wrong in the first year of life.

But now our daughter is 2 months old and she is as healthy as can be so I am considering downgrading to a cheaper plan next open enrollment season in October. $300/month (with my employer - the federal government - covering the other 72% of the premiums) is quite a lot for a young and healthy family. I saved a lot of money having it in a year when I knew I was going to have a child, but circumstances are always that fortuitous. I figure that money may be better spent elsewhere.

However, I have a sinking feeling in my gut that an HSA isn't all it is cracked up to be for retirement savings. I get the triple tax advantage, but that's only if you have out of pocket medical expenses to essentially convert the HSA funds into a ROTH IRA. I don't foresee my expenses ever equaling how much is in my account though. So that money will be stuck in the account until I am 65.

I plan on retiring at the minimum retirement age of 57. That's 8 long years without access to that money. I get that I could use the HSA for healthcare expenses once I retire, but I plan on carrying a better plan from my employment into retirement. There would be almost nothing out-of-pocket. I am patient and could possible wait on the money if it were worthwhile otherwise, but I have other concerns.

1) Saving medical receipts for 30 years. How many people can honestly say they are that good of record keepers? Some receipts are going to get lost, fade, or get destroyed well before you retire. Not to mention even if you still have all the receipts, the process of claiming thousands of expenses from the past 30 years seems awfully tedious and the last thing I will want to do.

2) Congress will change the rules. It seems like a major loophole to me that will be closed down one day. The intent of an HSA is to pay for healthcare costs, not sidestep taxes. 30 years is a long time for things to change. Maybe one day they make healthcare costs to be only redeemable in the year they are incurred. I'm not sure how likely this is though, and I can't think of any examples of the rules for a account of this type have changed years after they were created.

What do you all think? For my situation does it make sense to switch back to a HDHP? Are my concerns for naught?

personalfinance,"I have $X, and the FAQ isn't quite relevant to me. Help appreciated (SG)","Hi all,

I'm a full-time university student and I'm trying to get started with properly managing/investing my personal finances. My savings, for the most part, are sitting in low interest bank accounts (~0.05%) and that seems very inefficient. The amount is not large by any means (~$50k) but I think now's a great time to start looking at investing.

I've read the FAQ on the topic, but here's some reasons why it isn't quite relevant to me:

1.) My monthly expenses are relatively low. The savings figure mentioned above already excludes a 6 months emergency fund.

2.) My higher education fees are covered by scholarships. I have no employer, and thus no retirement plan. I have no debts.

3.) Singapore (where I stay) has no capital gains tax. Thus, most of the discussion on tax-efficient means of investment isn't relevant.

4.) I've thought of doing investments in shares and such, but being at university means I'd rather focus on my studies and not have to spent too much time actively managing investments.

5.) I've considered ETFs, but looking around my options in Singapore most banks charge a 1% transaction fee of sorts to buy into any ETF, which seems like a terrible deal.

6.) I'm rather risk adverse. I'm only hoping to counter inflation with my investments, really. I'm open to changing this if there's a good reason to.

7.) Singapore's savings rate is probably too high. Fixed deposit of 3-5 year terms are yielding 1-2% interest rates, which is pretty sad, and a tad too long for my liking.

Thus, my question is, what should I do with my savings? 

Are there any no-fee ETFs you'd recommend that's open to non-US citizens? I also realize most ETFs are denominated in USD and not SGD - would the forex fees I incur be a significant detriment?

Now the interest accumulation was deferred for each of the $20k loans at 3.5% until the year 2013. The interest for each $80k at 8.5% began compounding immediately at the time of loan.

I have no idea how this worked, but when I log in, I get these new amounts and interest rates:

1)$99,500.00 8.250%
2)$24,900.00 6.550%
3)$318,000.00 7.650%
4)$71,000.00 6.550% 

Last time I checked, I was around $513k deep.

What is the best way to go about paying this? I am currently on income based repayment and pay about $500 per month total (each loan is payed separate). 

Should I consolidate the loan with Great Lakes? I tried their loan calculator and it says the consolidated rate would be around 7.625%.

I do not think any other lender would take on this amount.

What are my options? I will be making $60k per year for the next 5 years. After 5 years I will be making about $300k/year (pretax).

Should I defer my payments until I start making real money? That $500 I pay back actually hurts my wallet right now so should I just wait and defer payments completely if it won't make a significant difference?

I really need tips here I feel way in over my head.

personalfinance,Mortgage refininancing,"My wife and I live in Northern California where the housing market is doing well. We were able to buy a house about 1.5 years ago but weren't able to put 20% down so we have to pay pmi. 

We were recently contacted by our mortgage broker asking is if we were interested in refinancing because interest rates have fallen(we pay 4.75% rates are now about 4% for us).   Our house has increased in value but not enough for us to have a 20% stake. 

Question is. Should we refinance now without putting any extra money down which would save us ~$200 per month or should we put down about $20000 more (which would get rid Of the pmi) saving us ~$500 per month",finance,1422056852

personalfinance,Back to school-federal loans to pay off Sallie Mae?,"Intro: I took out both federal and private (Sallie Mae) loans when I was in school for my Bachelor's.

Now I am going back to school on my work's dime starting this summer. However, they will only reimburse once the semester is over. So I'll have to pay up front. Right now I don't have the money to do that out of my savings. What I'm thinking about doing:

I take out a federal loan for the amount, at the end of the semester I will receive a check for the amount from work. Then I use that money from to pay towards Sallie Mae, which has a much higher interest rate. My thought is that I'm essentially taking on a loan for a lower rate, then using it to pay off a higher rate. This seems logical to me, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. 

Also, yes, I'll continue to make my monthly payments on Sallie Mae and Federal loans, although I'm back in school part time I have no intent of postponing what I owe.

Loan 1 - $14,500, 9.25% with a monthly payment of $170

Loan 3 - $3,750, 2.33% with a monthly payment of $50

I punched this info in a loan amortization calculator and at these payments I'd be paying the following interest on the loans:

Loan 1 - $9,220

Loan 2 - $4,750

Loan 3 - $290

So in total I'd be paying a little over $14k in interest if I just make the minimum payments.  I have $350 per month to budget towards paying down the loans early.  I want to minimize the total amount of interest that I pay over the life of all 3 loans.  Does anyone know of a nifty way to do that?

Obviously, I want to attack Loan #1 first, since that has a high balance and the highest interest rate.  I imagine I'd start off paying all $350 towards Loan #1.  But is there I point where I should start paying towards Loan #2 since it will have a higher principle and thus, interest payment.  There's got to be a way to optimize this, I just don't know how to.  Maybe I'm making it too complicated.",finance,1422064421

I have 200k of student loan debt from the doctorate which was a professional healthcare degree (7.1% avg interest; all gov't loans) and make approximately 150k per year. 

Current strategy is to have an emergency fund, max up to the 401k match, max roth ira, make large over payments on student loans, intentionally delaying graduation from the master's to prevent capitalization and payment of subsidized interest (effective interest rate is currently 4.75% when accounting for the subsidized portion). I calculated that IBR would not make sense for me, so I am in the ultra-fast repayment camp. I come from the middle class (barely), so my parents have no way to help (my wealthier classmates have borrowed money from their parents or taken a HELOC or refi against equity of homes to get am much better rate which is not an option for me). Still drive my 10 year old car, cook for majority of meals, and live just as frugally as before. 

Are there any other PF'rs on the same boat? I do not relate to many of the resources online since people like me are in a niche of making enough but have tons of debt. I do read whitecoatinvestor since it is healthcare related and cover similar situations faced by physicians with large amounts of student debt. Does anyone have other resources?

Are there strategies for people like us reduce our tax burden if we work for a large company? For example, I run websites that earn side income.. is there a way to legally form a llc and take out business loans for additional tax deductions? 

A note for those of you who are considering similar education paths of graduate school in the US: if you do not come from a wealthy family, you will have to bust your ass during school to ensure that you are employed out of school then continue to bust your ass to pay off these loans. I would recommend moving out of state and reducing your total tuition cost ESPECIALLY NOW since things continue to get worse for those pursuing more education (no more subsidized student loans, ballooning tuition costs, etc.).

I currently have three potential options that I am considering:

1. Continue to pay premiums (approx $480 per year) and use as life insurance and investment.
2. Cash out the policy, but a term replacement, and contribute the remainder to my 401(k)
3. Cash out the policy and contribute the amount to my 401(k)
4. Stop paying premiums, use it as ""free"" life insurance, while cash value continues to grow.  I would monitor this over time to ensure that it is still worth continuing as cost of insurance grows.

Any advice or input to this (or alternative options) would be great.

He is a PhD student who is funded and gets a small stipend.  We recently took out a personal loan at a lower interest rate to pay off higher-interest-rate credit card debt to save us paying more in interest in the long run.  We pay student loan debt, personal loan debt, and pay all our monthly expenses (rent, gas, groceries, bills) with no difficulty.  We have not been accumulating more debt in the past several months, which is such a relief to me.  While we are putting as much extra as we can to paying off the debt (anything above the minimum payment that we can), I think we should have a ""buffer"" of about $1000 in checking for unexpected expenses (medical, car repairs, etc.)  The other option would be to put all extra money into paying off the debt.  My thinking is that having this buffer will prevent us from having to use credit cards to pay these types of unexpected but necessary expenses.  Does this make sense, or should all ""extra"" money be put towards paying off the debt?

I am current on the federal loans and several months behind the private ones. I make payments when I can, but the payments are never even equal to the minimums.

Oh, I should mention that 2 of those 7 loans are with Great Lakes and currently in unemployment deferment. I'm really just concerned with the 2 loans through Navient, and the 2 through AES as I'm not able to make the payments.

Now, I fully intend on paying the loans if they would just wait until I have the money. I have made quite a bit of progress in paying off debt in the last year. This time last year I owed $4000 on my credit card. That will be paid off completely tomorrow. I've also been current with the small, Federal loan through Navient that I've been paying on since August. And I've almost paid off the college.

I feel like it's almost a waste of money to pay toward them since I can't make the payments and would only fall behind again. 

My debt reduction method has been a combination of the snowball and avalanche methods. I started paying off the highest interest rate first (credit card at 12.9%). Then I kept current with paying off the school and the first loans minimum payments. I feel as though it is better for me to pay off the smallest amounts first to get rid of them, rather than pay toward the bigger loans, then later not be able to make the payments, and all the money go toward interest.

I also have a spare bedroom that I could rent out for approx $700/mo. However, I am at the age where I prefer to live alone and my girlfriend will be moving in this year (she will help with the mortgage).

I work out of town a lot and I'm currently looking for work where I can be home every night. This will cut my income to slightly under $5000/mo but I could easily save on fast food and restaurants and probably gas/generaly be more frugal. I am also looking into other means of income, which will be easier to pursue if I'm home every night/weekend.

I have been fairly bad with money this past year (large impulse purchases, spending too much at the bar, etc.) but I feel like I'm getting better.

I never thought I would have to spend close to $4000/mo to live a certain lifestyle, growing up we never had this kind of money. So I'm becoming very paranoid and worried that I'm living outside my means. I would like to start investing later this year and properly manage my income.

investing,An write up on risk.,"I don't think this is covered enough for the noobs.  

As I have posted before I have decided to remove my taxable investments and put them towards the house.  I understand historically the market has beat 3.8%.  Hell I understand some stocks pay more than 3.8% in dividends.  However, several reasons make this the best choice for me.  There is a good chance the spouse and I might move in a few years.  If rates go up I'll be relocking at whatever the current rate is assuming we don't pay cash outright.  So I might have 5% mortgage.  Or maybe rates will be lower.  They are lower than when I bought almost 3 years ago.  If I still have my rental I'll then have to be screwing with the banks that don't seem to understand we don't live our life like most people and I can in fact pay things off they way I say I can.  I was told several years ago we could only get $528 a month for a house loan if I kept our other house in rental status.  We were putting about 1-1.5k in savings a month after all expenses WITHOUT collecting rental income.  That means I could make both payments easily.  I laughed at the banker when I was given the $528 number but that is what their numbers say.  So when/if we move again I won't be screwing around with buying on contingency if the house is paid.

I have no crystal ball.  

What I do have is knowledge and the fact I watched what happened to my money after I invested for the first time in 1999 in a Roth IRA.  Yeah, that took a long time to recover.  I'd been better taking the 3.8% return.

I'm not comfortable investing in anything with a 5 year time horizon right now.  But again I have no crystal ball so I let the 401k do its thing.  I do believe continued investment over time produces good results.  I also know that mathematically if I was sure I didn't need this money for 30 years I'd be better off lump summing it.

But it is the time frame that I am concerned about.  Stuff can happen in a blink of an eye.  Jobs can be gone.  Bills can pile up.  I could be sued.  I could get sick an not work.

Debt.  I have lots of it.  I have student loans and I still have the other mortgage on the rental.  This debt doesn't bother me.  I can always defer the student loans if I have hardship and if the bank repo's my rental so what.  Opps.  If that happens I'll be up shit creek anyways.

So looking at risk as a whole what do market returns get me?  I might be able to get 5% more by investing and not paying on the house.  However, we must remember if I do move I'm relocking at the new rate.  So if rates go up to whatever and I have to get a loan maybe my 5% is now 3%.  I also will have the issue with bank and getting a new loan if I still have to make payments on the house monthly or screw around buying on contingency.  While I could hold money in my taxable if I start over funding the 401k I'm locking that money up.  I couldn't get it to pay on the 5% loan if rates rise.  I'd have the roths maxed so I could pull the principle on those but then I can't refund them to the level I had them at.

So on the 100k I have left on the house over 30 years it would be a nice return.  However, IF history repeats itself I'll basically only have 7% more by lump suming the money into the market and holding for 30 years and making min payments on the house (assuming we don't move for 30 years) vs. paying off the house and then investing large sums of money monthly.  7% is the number.

So that is if everything goes right.  That is no job loss, no market crash, and no whatever.  Now what if stuff goes wrong?  What if I lose my job?  What if I do get hurt?  What if this happens while the market takes a dive?

That is a situation I don't want to be in.  Couple that with I firmly believe interest rates aren't going to rise that much.  I think the fed is finally going to raise rates but it won't be much.  I think we will be in a near zero inflation period for quite some time.  As such I don't believe any asset class is going extra ordinarily well compared to the past.  I think the market will grind on but I don't think we will see the historic returns of the past.  What is going to drive the growth?  If anything deflation seems to still be a bigger threat.  Now Europe is doing QE.

So what this all boils down to is if things go according to history the game is over for me either way and I win.  If I were to invest essentially using my house as margin I could be faced with finical ruin.  Now admittedly that risk is small.  But if someone told me that today 1-24-15 if you walk outside there is 99.5% change you won't be shot but a 0.5% chance someone will murder you I'd probably just stay in doors for the day.

Everyone should evaluate risk.  Everyone should have goals.  If you go over to wsb you'll see someone put a 30k on apple calls.  The numbers are saying he has reached 66% of max profit anyways from the time frame he made the investment.  IV crush is going to kill him.  Apple is also trending upward.  This makes a further large spike upwards unlikely.  If fact if anything it makes a miss likely to cause a huge drop.  He allegedly is still holding the position.  It's a dumb move any way you play it in my opinion. 

So there is nothing wrong with locking in some gains on the year on both bonds and stocks and going home.  This is what I was trying to post up about when I say I made 10% gains on my bonds and 15% in my taxable.  I hit way over the profit level I expected especially on the bonds.  I was not going to hold through another federal reserve meeting.  I think shit is to high for short term money.  The downside potential is to great for me for the goals I have.  

Have a goal.  Stick with it.  Change it if necessary but make well thought out moves.  People put to much emotion on money.  We'll all be dead in 100 years.  Time is the most valuable thing.  We only have so long to do certain things.  I'd rather insure I'll be able to do mostly what I want in the upcoming 30 to 40 years than make another couple hundred thousand.  It isn't worth the risk to me.",finance,1422130378

Bitcoin,Social Networking + Cryptocurrency = SYNEREO,"A new chapter of the Synereo Network Dynamics presentation has been released! Read on for the details. 

If you're new to Synereo, here's a brief overview:

Synereo is a next-gen social network that puts security, identity, and community management directly under your purview, respecting your attention and rewarding you for your activity on the network.
As Internet users today are fed controlled news streams and tailored ads based on their social and search history, we believe that we are approaching a time where our social networks are ripe for maturity; is it time to find solutions that work for us. 

**Why Synereo?**

Synereo represents a new collection of ideas and paradigms, and a very realistic set of changes that we would like to see in the world. Synereo employs a novel attention model, discussed in the presentations below. The model aims to create a tailored environment for each user on the network through constantly evolving the flow of information. This depends on the way users attend, and act on, content reaching them. 

**Network Dynamics Presentations**

The first Networks Dynamics chapter deals with the basics and shows how user engagement with content from different peers and sources on Synereo has a direct impact on the topology of the network and the way data flows through it. 
In this way, the Synereo network dynamically reshapes to facilitate that flow to where it will be appreciated.

The second chapter, released today, deals with Synereo’s tool for organizing the content stream around interests and communities. These entities operate as something between a hashtag and a group, and offer a great deal of functionality to those wishing to explore it. See the presentation to learn more!

Unfortunately, you can see my monthly spendable is low and I am using that money for groceries, gas, entertainment, and gifts. I am blessed to have a lot of friends and family, but it seems like every month there is someone's birthday to celebrate or a holiday that will cost.

I'm 23, single, no dependents and this last semester was my first semester of college.

personalfinance,"So I have a really serious credit card debt problem and want a consolidation loan, but I don't know if there's a way.","Basically, I fucked up really bad and ran up $8800 of credit card debt. Bad, I know.

I have it down to about $8400 right now. But keeping track of all the different cc companies, due dates, interest rates, and all that junk is really making me weary. I would like to consolidate all the debt into one loan, with one interest rate, and one monthly payment.

It would be nice to be able to make progress on this debt rather than continuing to flounder the way I am. A lower interest rate would mean this debt would be gone faster. One payment to one company would be a hell of a lot easier, too.

The problem, obviously, is that my credit is not so great after running up such a huge debt, and I haven't made great progress on paying the debt I currently own.

personalfinance,How can I ensure my credit is in top shape for an upcoming auto loan?,"Hi, /r/personalfinance!  I love this sub and all the great advice I read here.  I'm hoping to get some guidance on my credit score so I can get the best interest rate on a car loan later this year.  I'm 22, $44K/year and my husband is 24, $28K/year.  No debt other than about $4.5K in student loans.

I opened my first credit card in June 2011 when I was 18; it now has a $5300 limit, of which I typically use less than $300 per month.  I have never had a late/missed payment.  My car quit unexpectedly one month later, leading to an auto loan that I just paid off a couple of months ago.  Same deal -- didn't miss a payment.

Right after my credit limit was bumped up to $5300, my credit score soared.  My FICO score (as shown on my Discover account) hit 799.  Once I paid off my car loan, however, it has dropped to 757.  My SavvyMoney score shows 766; and Mint still has me at 793.  The reasoning on my Discover account says my credit age is too young and I have no installment loan information available.

I'm hoping to buy a car this summer and want to be sure I can get a good rate.  We'll also be applying for a different apartment, which will likely result in a credit inquiry.  Is relying on my credit card enough to keep my score up?  Is there a credit usage ""sweet spot"" I should be hitting?  Am I just being paranoid?",finance,1422168558
personalfinance,Private Loan Collection / SOL / DOFD questions,"I don't want to go long into detail, so here's as TL;DR as I can get:

* I had a TERI loan, which is was delinquent on
* Galaxy International LLC purchased the delinquent loan when TERI went bankrupt
* I took out the loan in 2006, I don't know the DOFD date but it was likely in 2008.
* I was contacted by Enterprise Recovery (ERS) in June 2013 and offered a pay-as-I-go settlement for $14,000 **which I stupidly took**
* I payed them roughly $310 for 12 months (I don't believe this every brought the loan current)
* After 12 months (July 2014) the autodrafts stopped, per federal law, and they never contacted me to re-auth the drafts
* December 2014, they contact me to re-authorize, I oblige, but:
* January 2015 - Alpha Recovery contacts me saying the account is with them now
* ARS Demands full payment on an offer of $11,700 settlement
* I can't afford that, they threaten to go after my mother (cosigner of original loan)
* Mother refuses to pay that full mount, and rightly so
* They have given me until Jan. 30 to take the settlement

Also note:

* My state, PA, has a 4 year SOL on these kinds of loans

So yeah, what do I do here? I have a few questions:

1. Does the SOL go according to my state, or the state of the original creditor (TERI?)
2. Does the DOFD get reset with that sort of repayment plan I agreed to? Or does the fact that I wouldn't have been bringing it current with each payment mean that I'm still over the 4 years SOL?
3. In your opinion, did I accidentally revive this loan?
4. Where do I go from here?

I have average credit (about 650 score) but have a separate credit account, as well as a very LARGE chunk of federal student loan debt that's still growing (I'm currently in grad school) so my debt/credit ratio is probably quite low. The same can't be said for my wife, who has good credit and a low ratio.

I'm a veteran and I'm wondering:

If all else fails, would it be adviseable to take out a $12,000 loan with wife as cosigner, using Navy Federal Credit Union, USAA, or PA State Credit Union, which would drop cut $8,000 from my debt and give me a markedly lower interest rate?

personalfinance,"Student Taxes/Credits (no loans), Plain English?","Hello Reddit!

I recently returned to college. I'm attending a community college, and my federal financial aid exceeds my college costs (for the moment). I'm unsure how to deal with this on taxes, and maximize any potential refund. Up until this point, I've always had my taxes done by family. 

I've been trying to read about the potential educational tax credits and about how all of this works, but I keep reading conflicting information and I'm honestly lost in all of the legal lingo. I really wish PF had a stickied thread for ""student's guide to taxes"" that just put everything in plain English! :)

1. Does any amount in excess of my educational costs (books, fees, tuition, supplies directly used in class) count as income? 

2. Should I list the cost of educational expenses on my tax forms if federal aid is covering the expense, or should I only list whatever expenses are in excess of the aid amount? 

3. Under educational expenses, should I list the total amount (the amount billed on my 1098-T PLUS qualifying expenses for supplies), or ONLY the qualifying expenses for supplies. I assume the 1098-T figures will be listed elsewhere on my 1040.

4. What, if any, educational credits or deductions should I consider applying for? The three I'm aware of are the Lifetime Learning Credit, the American Opportunity Credit, and the Tuition and Fees deduction. Unfortunately, I'm really unsure if I directly qualify for any of these.

Quick facts:

* I made roughly $12,500 last year. Be default I claim 0 deductions and maximize withholding on my W2. 

* I am 24 years old and fully independent. I live in another state from any other family. I solely manage my financial obligations, and I am considered independent on FAFSA.

* Adding the amount billed from my 1098-T with the qualifying expenses for educational supplies, I spent roughly $2,100 on school last year. I received roughly $3,100 in federal aid.

* I attended college for one semester last year. I took a significant pay cut during this time, as class hours interfered with work hours.

* I've applied for, but not received, any scholarships that might be considered for tax purposes.

* I am a declared degree-seeking student, and intend to end up with a Master's degree for nurse anesthesia. (This college has a great RN program, and many of the local 4-year universities have great RN-to-BSN programs.)

* (not sure if this affects anything) Due to a failed first degree in aviation, I lose eligibility for the Pell grant before I graduate here with my RN. I'll be living mostly on student loans through the RN-to-BSN program (~1 year).

* I am currently based out of Texas.",finance,1422205425

I'm in a hot real estate market right now, and though I want to buy to take advantage of that by buying again if possible, I'm also open to renting for a period if it makes more sense to pay down loans first.

* I have equity in the form of options with my company that will cost ~$20K to exercise

* I'd really like to build some other investments, as I currently have $1,500 in a Vanguard index fund

* I spent my savings getting the house ready to sell, so part of the proceeds from the sale would also go back into savings / emergency fund.

* $5K invested

* $5K to exercise options (and set a goal for exercising $5K/year until bought up — the business is growing really steadily)

* $10K to pay the highest interest loans

So I have $2069 a month left over to cover food, entertainment, saving/debt reduction.  At the end of the fiscal year, if I hit my bonus target I will get an extra $7900 and then another $2600 ($10,500).  My question to you guys is what should I do with the money I will save and my bonuses?  What percentage of $2069 is reasonable to budget for food/entertainment and should I put my money to repaying my debt or saving/investing?  My company offers stock options where I can buy company stock at 85% of the share price every 6 months.  These options are exercised 6 months after the bi-annual enrollment and the price I pay for the stock will be either what it was 6 months ago or its current price, whichever is lower.  This way I am guaranteed a 15% return no matter what.  However, if I sell those shares before 2 years I will have to pay income tax on that 15% and capital gains tax on any amount the share price has appreciated, so in truth about a 11% guaranteed return after taxes and more if the stock price rises.  The way I see it, you should pay down your highest interest loans first, which in my case is my car at 10.6%.  Since I earn a higher return with the company stock, I am putting 10% of my income there ($600/mo).  My goal is to pay off my car and have $25k in savings/investments.  My question to reddit is should I be paying down my car or buying company stock?  If I buy company stock I figure it acts as a hedge if I ever lose my job I can then access that money as savings whereas if I put it towards car repayment I do not have that option.  However, there is risk associated with leaving the money in the form of stock after exercising the option because at that point the ROI is no longer guaranteed and is at the mercy of the financial markets.  Is it better to bank the guaranteed 11% return on the company stock and immediately sell and put the money towards car repayment or to hold and bear (pun!) the risk of having all my eggs in one basket?

personalfinance,"Just came to the realization that bankruptcy might actually be my best option, right when I was making so many positive changes. I'm overwhelmed by information, though. Private &amp; federal student loans, plus misc other debt in the mix.","Feel free to skip to the TL;DR for a ""brief"" summary and my specific question. If you are so inclined to read the rest... well, it could be an interesting case study. It was quite therapeutic for me to write it out for the first time.

I'm 29 years old, living in Arizona. I graduated college with a BS in Psychology in July 2013, and within 2 weeks of graduating, I got a job. I doubled my income instantly. 6 months later, I moved up a little and now make $32,000 per year. Getting a college degree really does make a difference. Life got in the way of me pursuing a college education so, so many times. But I did it. Yay!

Oh. Shit. But that college was A LOT of money, and I messed up along the way. Beyond having a co-signer on loans, I've been 100% responsible for the cost. Grants here and there, but no scholarships. Also, I didn't have much support along the way and was dealing with a lot that I won't go into here. It took a lot for me to finish my degree, basically because I was trying to fully support myself in the process (with, let's face it, no idea of how to do so in a responsible way). My total student debt now is about $86,000. $24,000 of that debt is in private student loans from Wells Fargo and Sallie Mae. The rest is in federal loans. The reason the student debt is so high is a combination of the following: (a) I was part-time at a community college for several years and withdrew several times due to health-related issues (money wasted), (b) by the time I was able to stick to it, I chose online college to allow myself time to have a full-time work schedule (at a shitty wage, because no degree yet), and (c) I took out private loans to settle previous creditor debts that I was getting lawsuits for (I succeeded, mostly...except for the part where now I'm paying new loans, albeit at lower interest overall. I made your typical 18-year-old credit card mistakes). I also still have some unresolved medical debts, and I don't even know what those are at this point. It's a couple thousand or more (I know, I need to look up those numbers, but for the purpose of this post, let's just say $2,000 since it's already looking grim enough). 

As you can imagine....my credit is already trashed, so I'm guessing that no bankruptcy is going to make it worse. I've been trying to repair it, and the needle hasn't moved much.

Let's talk about positive changes. I have no more credit cards, my car is paid off (not good aesthetic condition, but running strong), I finally have stable housing and income by my own efforts, I managed to get a savings account going for a little while and avoided taking on more debt last year when emergencies came up (though now that savings account is depleted), and all of my loan accounts are currently in good standing. I've gotten a budget together using the envelope system, and I'm getting to paydays with money left in my account from the previous one. I  used unbury.me to plan out my private loan payments, and I made room in my budget to pay every extra penny toward these to get them paid off by March 2019. Great! 

But...my federal loans are all in deferment until I get a raise or two to be able to afford an IBR payment. No idea what that would be, but I have no more than a $30 cushion left over after other payments each month, so I can't do it right now. I do work for a non-profit behavioral health agency, so I would likely qualify for public service loan forgiveness (umm, cue massive savings efforts to handle that tax burden). I want to get those payments started now, but since it's not in the cards, there's not much I can do. I accepted all of this. 

Panic and thoughts of bankruptcy happened when I sat down to do my taxes today. Remember when I said I doubled my income? Well, this is the first year that I owe money. I obviously made poor choices on my exemptions (I selected 3, per the worksheet, as I recall). The sad part about this is not only the fact that I owe $500 that I don't currently have, but this also means that to fix it, I will need to take home less money per month. How much less, I don't know, but seeing as though I already don't have much of a cushion, I'm not going to be able to pay things off the way I planned. Oh. I also need to get an emergency savings going again, which currently isn't in my budget. I was hoping to use whatever tax refund I got for that, as it worked last year. Back to the drawing board.

I'm overwhelmed, but I would almost rather just keep chipping away at my debt slowly than go through the process of bankruptcy. For me, it's not about any kind of stigma. It's about stress. But the reality is that my income and career situation will never grow or improve without graduate school, nor will my career passions be fulfilled. I need a master's degree to be licensed, which will open up the door to an instant $10,000 more per year income right off the bat, followed by the ability to practice independently in the future. I simply can't pay my debts on $32,000 per year. I will be chipping away for 20 years, meanwhile never getting to grad school (because, let's be real, I can't start grad school with this much debt). 

Long history over. Here's a wrap-up, a few extra numbers, and a question:

TL;DR I have $24,000 in private student loan debt, plus a couple thousand in medical debts (in collections). I also have $62,000 in federal student loans that are currently in deferment. I make $32,000 per year with $343 in minimum payments due per month on my private loans, so I can't hope to touch my federal loans until those are gone. I've learned that I was claiming too many exemptions, so to avoid owing taxes next year, I will have to reduce the extra $150 that I was paying toward loans. If I can wipe out the $24,000 in private loans and the medical debt, I'm confident I can handle an IBR loan payment for the next 10 years (I would likely qualify for public service loan forgiveness). If I don't wipe out the $24,000+ debt, I see myself paying these debts for a lot longer. 

QUESTION: Would bankruptcy allow me to get rid of the private loan and medical debts, and would I be risking future opportunities for student borrowing for a master's degree? Bonus question: Am I foolish for even thinking about a master's degree considering my current hell?

If you took the time to read any of this.... may the gods smile upon you, you patient, caring soul. Thank you.

I'm a British citizen living back in the UK. I don't have any income stateside except for renting out the condo to try and cover the mortgage. I just make it - but given high HOA fees I've got to top up once a year a lump sum, that and of course Tax time. That said, I've not needed to file personal income returns for the last few years.

If anyone here can give me advice I'd appreciate it, my question is:

As the condo is rented out, and I live abroad, can I refinance? If so; what position does having tenants there have - in the UK it would mean a ""commercial"" or ""buy-to-let"" mortgage, which normally doesn't attract a favorable interest rate, and might mean it's not worth changing from the existing loan (which is obviously still my primary residence, in the US. But I'm not actually living there..)

One idea I did have was to max out finances in the Uk and aim to try and pay off the mortgage (no-penalties) but I'm imaging that it wouldn't sit favorably for my tax position there: I'd be ""earning"" and I'd have to stat filing again... right?

Our Finances:
We live in Los Angeles, own a condo, and have two incomes.  We are fairly young, 33 and 27.  We are married, filing jointly with no children or other dependents.
My Wages (Box 1) - $189,091
Her Wages (Box 1) - $73,656

We both max our our 401K contributions.  We enjoy life, and travel a lot, but haven't adjusted our lifestyle much in the past few years, so we save a tremendous amount of our income, about $75,000 annually.  We donate about $10,000 to various charities annually as well.  We're highly considering a 2nd property for 2015 as a rental and then will be investing the remaining cash we have in a 3 fund portfolio.  We have an ample emergency fund for 6mo of expenses, without any shift in lifestyle.  

1. When I punch in our property tax payments for 2014 into TurboTax ($7355) our 'Tax Owed' as calculated by TurboTax only drops by about $200.  Given our tax bracket I was assuming a significantly higher deduction.  Is this a glitch on TurboTax's end?  Or is the property tax deduction phased out at specific income levels?

2. I was a bit surprised to see we owed taxes, but I must have been off in my asusmptions when doing my W-4 calculation. I figured, why not contribute to an IRA to reduce the tax burden rather than give the money away.  When I used TurboTax to help estimate the impact, it indicated that given our AGI and that we have employer retirement plans we were not eligible for tax deductions to IRA, is this accurate or am I doing something wrong in the software?

3. Currently, our Federal Tax Due is right around $3800.  Surprisingly, for CA, we will receive a $1725 refund.  I think I had 2 main issues this year.  First, my wife and I received some unexpected bonuses, which I think may have bumped us from the 28% bracket into the 33% bracket.  Additionally, the Federal withholding on my wife's check is likely not appropriate, as we've not made adjustments given our tax bracket.  Any assistance in planning the appropriate way to manage both of our pay checks would be greatly appreciated.

4. Any other suggestions, given our income level, on suggestions to reduce our tax exposure/burden?

**Situation** My previous employer's firm closed my 401k and mailed me a check for $285.56. The pre-tax amount was $390.70 and federal tax taken out was $78.14, state taken out was $27.00 (MD). I'm 26, earning $55k annually, and have an existing Roth IRA (expecting higher income/tax bracket).

**Options**

- Open a new Traditional IRA

- Convert the funds and transfer to my existing Roth IRA

**Questions**

If I rollover into a new Traditional IRA, I understand I have to deposit the check and the 20% federal tax deducted (285.56 + 78.14).

- What about the state tax? Do I have to include this amount in the deposit as well? If not, how does this affect my State taxes for TY 2014?

- What are the tax implications (if any) when filing taxes for TY 2014, Federal and State?

If I choose to contribute this to my existing Roth IRA:

- I just have to mail them the check, since taxes have already been taken out--correct?

- How will this affect my taxes for TY 2014?

One post I read said that the federal tax withheld previous would be refunded to me--would I have to contact the previous custodian for the account, the IRS (+ State Comptroller), or would this be automatic?

What would you guys do--Traditional vs existing Roth?

personalfinance,My roommate is trying to decide if he should place money into a retirement fund or pay off a student loan. Details inside.,"He has $7300 owed in student loans at 6.5% interest. At current minimum payments he will have this paid off in 5 years. Additionally, he has a retirement fund at 7% that he is interested in throwing an additional $80 per month into. However, he is wondering if he should just add the $80 per month to the student loan instead.

His intuition is to throw it into the retirement fund because the interest rate is higher and he would therefore net a higher value. However, for a significant portion of time, there will be more money accruing interest in the student loan than there would be in the retirement account, so this complicates the solution. 

We ran numbers through interest and savings calculators on the internet, but it seems to be an optimization problem that would benefit from a Differential Equations treatment or some linear regression technique. Neither of us, unfortunately are mathematicians, but we are curious about how to go about deciding how best to allocate the funds to maximize gains (while inversely, simultaneously minimizing losses).

Even further complications arose when we considered that the value of the retirement money would be depreciated by inflation when he is finally old enough to spend it.

So in the end:

1. What is the best way to allocate the money to maximize his prosperity?
2. What kind of math do you use to solve this problem? (If you could point to any good software,  we are both programmers if that is relevant.)

personalfinance,"I've been putting off investing, got $50k which I think I'm unlikely to need [AU]","(I have read the FAQ, but it seemed geared towards the US and mentioned to ask for specific advice. Also I'm interested in how crazy people think it is just to hold onto cash; conservative or dumb?)


Got about $90k in total. Interest rates are looking to go down, the AU $ is falling, inflation is looking to go up, property here seems unaffordable and risky (I'm renting).

At the moment I've got a savings account with 4%pa, but interest is taxed as income so that becomes more like 2.x%, which is probably slightly lower than inflation.

I'm a nerd so I keep fairly good track of my finances, here's a graph of my income/expense/savings you might get a kick out of:

http://i.imgur.com/8hoWQsc.png

(I know it looks like my expenditure always matches my income and I could save more, and to a small extent that's true, but bear in mind when that graph starts I was a student living at home and now I rent and own a car.)


Investing has always seemed very risky to me, because I feel like I'm bound to know less about it than the person selling, and why would someone sell me something that's a good investment? 
I like the &lt;$200k Australian government guarantee I get on my back accounts (and I'm paying for it so I feel I should use it), but I definitely don't like the thought of my savings value evaporating away.

There are some funds I've looked at that look like they've done well, e.g: https://www.platinum.com.au/Performance/Performance-Charts/PAF/MSAA/
But when you take into account:

- The investor fees and capital gains, my inherent feeling that when a layperson invests they must be getting duped, 
- If I'm investing a lot of other finance idiots must be, 
- And the volatility over long periods,
It looks less attractive.


As I said my goals are to reduce my exposure to the AU$, get better returns than inflation, and diversify without setting up and monitoring several smallish investments or handing my money over to a more savvy stranger and hope they will do that for me.
Risking a small loss in value is acceptable, but I would feel worried if I thought there was even a chance I'd lose more than 20%.
I can't see a need for $50k of the $90k for a fair while, but another $30k would be good to have fairly liquid in case some s**t hits the fan. 

I'm 27 and 9.x% of my money goes into a retirement account automatically, which is currently sitting at $38k. This will go up to 12.5% by 2020 so they say. Given the retirement age is currently going up to 70 and who knows where it'll be when I'm 70, and the government is taking responsibility for deciding a sensible retirement investment % for me, retirement isn't at the top of my mind.


I feel like I'm asking the impossible because if was easy everyone would do it, but that has left me delaying for too long already. Everyone knew the AU$ was going to fall significantly for over a year but I've been stubbornly cautious in holding onto cash.

personalfinance,Refinance my house or just pay it down?,"I bought a foreclosure in 2008. Here are the stats on my mortgage:

* Original amount: $38k
* Current amount owed: $32.5k
* Interest Rate: 7%
* Payment: $252.81/mo (not including property tax/insurance)

The interest rate is quite high. I do pay extra principal and expect to pay off this house within four years.

The house is certainly worth at least as much as I owe, and probably closer to $60k or more if I tried selling it based on recent home prices in my area. It has not been appraised.

Based on my anticipated future payment schedule, I've determined that refinancing into a 10 or 15-year 3.25% mortgage (seems realistic) would save me at least ~$2400 and not increase my payment at all. However, I have no idea how much a refinance would cost and am looking for general advice.

* What can I expect to pay if I refinance this, and what is the cost breakdown?
* The amount owed is pretty low. Will any bank/CU even entertain refinancing 32.5k? I looked into refinancing awhile ago but my CU's loan officer told me not to bother.
* If they do, would I be penalized in the form of a higher interest rate because of the low principal?
* I have solid credit, around 748 with no derogatory marks or high utilization. What interest rate could I feasibly get?

Bitcoin,How much centralization is enough?,"Imagine a world where Bitcoin is worth between $10k and $1m each. Inequality problems aside, do you guys want 99% of volume to be done on centralized exchanges and payment processors? If so, Bitcoin becomes non-fungible for the average consumer, leaving privacy to a small number of more sophisticated (and perhaps brave) technologists experimenting with side chains, altcoin markets, etc. 

Mining centralizing may have the same effect: with a few government sponsored farms collaborating under a legal framework. That union could as easily be a form of despotism as it can be a benevolent dictatorship. With popularity, the rush to create a transactions approval council will be a first step after some terrorist attack tied to cryptocurrency, or some other crisis.

I ask these questions because this community seems delighted to have centralized institutions leverage their power to prop up the price. Whether it be Coinbase, the ETF, etc -- this community sounds sometimes like a bunch of children craving legitimization of their toy. We have strayed a bit far from Satoshi's original statement of warning: *The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks*. We should remember that monetary policy is not the only tool that can be abused by central powers. 

These are the things we should care about:

 * The health of the P2P network, such as the number of full nodes. There should be rewards for running nodes that would provide incentive in the face of some yet unknown adversary.
 * The health of the mining network, with some way for miners to prove independence from each other. The solution to mining centralization may also ultimately be social rather than a piece of code.
 * The ease of use for every conceivable case, without requiring a 3rd party for security, reversibility, trust (""grandma proof"").

Price is important, but secondary to the above things. 

Remember: Central clearing (and doxing) are being used to justify current high valuations for Bitcoin companies. At these valuations, the sum of VC companies is worth more than the monetary base. I think this community wants more than ""cheaper faster paypal"". We want free as in speech, not just as in beer. 

I know right now Bitcoin is this amazing technology that we love and cherish, but the internet was just like that two decades ago.

Student Loans: 28k (half of that is 6.5%, half is 3.5%)

Monthly rent: 730

0 other debt

Fully-funded 401k, emergency fund set aside, an additional $7k in savings, etc. 



Normally the way to go would be to just keep renting and pay off those student loans, which should be easy enough in a couple years with my generally good paycheck. The unique thing is the cost of houses around where I live are very low - I live in a midwestern region that was hit particularly hard by the housing bubble and recession and hasn't really recovered just yet (but is very much doing so), and part of me wants to take advantage of this. $100k can get you a 1k square foot 3 bed/1 bath type house pretty easily, and in 2006 that would've run you around $150k. At one point around 2010 that would've cost as low as $70k or so, and since then things are gradually headed back up. 



Given the unusually low costs and the fact that interest rates are still really low, I'm nervous about waiting 3 years until all debts are gone AND 20% cash is handy only to find out interest rates are up a few percent and home values are up 15% more. It's hardly a guarantee that things would rebound that significantly, but it is a legitimate risk. Not to mention that buying a home at that low of a cost with my income is easily going to be less than what I'm paying to rent, so I'd have additional monthly income.

investing,Potential for increasing gold reserves. Part 2.,"Gold reserve for the eight-year period from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2013 increased by 2.58 times. This is one of the highest growth of gold reserves. Perhaps equally high rates of growth of gold reserves were in China. But a very specific Chinese statistics camouflages processes of accumulation of yellow metal. The main source of growth in gold reserves of Russia is its domestic production. Within the period under review, it also grew (production increase 1.72 times).
From the middle of the last decade, Russia's leaders have stated several times that it is necessary to increase gold reserves, and by purchasing gold from our miners. It is well known that the production of ""yellow metal"" has always been a ""currency shop"" of the country. At the Russian monetary authorities (central banks and the Ministry of Finance) has a powerful capacity reserve of gold in their reserves. In 2010, reached the maximum value of the index increase gold reserves / annual production (86.4%). He then began to decline to less than 1/3 in 2013.

Final data on gold reserves for all of last year have not yet been published. The latest information on the Bank of Russia's December 1, 2014 - 1.188 m. Simple estimation shows that almost certainly as of January 1 of this year, reserves the pass through the strap 1200. Annual production of ""yellow metal"" for 2014, according to Russian Union of Gold, was approximately 280 tons. We can estimate the growth of gold reserves in the past year, it turns out 164 tons. This will be the largest annual increase since the inception of the Russian Federation. This increase in relation to the annual production can be estimated at 58.6%.

Another detail concerning the gold reserves. We mentioned above that the foreign exchange reserves of the Russian Federation are the responsibility of both the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance. The latter belong to the Reserve Fund and the National Welfare Fund. A Bank of Russia only by special agreement manages foreign exchange resources of the two funds. With gold reserves situation is different. Almost all monetary gold (only monetary gold is included in reserve) belongs to the Bank of Russia. Of 1036 tonnes of gold constituting Russia's international reserves (as of January 1, 2014), the Ministry of Finance of gold had only 23 tons, ie less than 0.1%.

In my estimation, if the monetary authorities carried out the purchase of 100 percent of the gold mined in Russia, it is only for the period 2006-2014. additional increase in the gold reserves of the country amounted to 900-950 tons. This means that on December 31, 2013, he would be equal to 1950-2000 tons. This figure exceeds the hypothetical historical highs, which was recorded in pre-revolutionary Russia (1,208 tons in 1914) and close to the historical peak of the USSR (2150 tons in 1953).

investing,Gold as a strategic reserve of Russia. Part 3.,"I should add that if the release of the Bank of Russia Rubles not under foreign currency, and under mined gold in their own country, it would solve several interrelated tasks.
The main ones are:
1) the planned reversal in the direction of the Central Bank of the Russian economy;
2) Support the development of ""currency shop"" of the country;
3) The implementation of monetary emission without creating inflation;
4) protection of Russian economic sanctions;
5) the formation of a strategic reserve, which may be required in case of war.
By the way, we must clearly understand, which requires the accumulation of gold in Russia. Some believe that such accumulation is necessary to strengthen the ruble, and then make it a ""gold standard"". Strengthen the ruble, from my point of view, it is possible and necessary. But no gold backing and the introduction of free convertibility of the ruble in gold, and the development of the real sector of the economy, import substitution, industrialization of the country. On the sad experience of the introduction of gold ruble in Russia (""reform Witte"" in 1897) has repeatedly stated. The then ""innovation"" has driven Russia into a debt loop, as required to support the ruble to maintain the country's gold reserves (gold constantly flows abroad). We had to constantly refer to the world moneylenders for loans to replenish the gold metal reserve of the State Bank of the Russian Empire. The country on the eve of the First World War occupied the 4th or 5th place in many kinds of industries, but the foreign debt was in first place in the world.

Once again, the gold is not necessary for the conduct of monetary policy of the Central Bank (some even offer to carry out the Bank of Russia ""golden intervention""), and to ensure that the country was a strategic reserve. In the 1930s, when the West economic crisis broke out, were eliminated remnants of the gold standard. Money lost contact with the metal. But the country continued to accumulate gold reserves, because everyone understood that soon there will be war. And then it and it alone will be the only ""universal equivalent"" in the world market. USSR also accumulate gold reserves. According to some estimates, in 1941, he had already exceeded 2,000 tons.

By the way, as a strategic reserve of gold it would be wise to keep the balance sheet is not the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance. Incidentally, in the United States all their thousands of tons of gold in 1934 are in the treasury. In the USSR, the Ministry of Finance was ruled gold reserves, and the State Bank (and its subordinate Bank for Foreign Trade) only perform certain gold transactions on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. Especially unacceptable accumulation and storage of gold in the institution, which ""independent"" from the state. Namely this status is today the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, concentrated in the hands of almost 100% gold reserve of Russia.

personalfinance,Where to put our cash?,"Greetings. My wife and I have been having a debate for a while on how to best handle the money in our savings account.  I will provide details below, but the gist is this:

Is it better to keep ""cash"" in a savings account (with a 0.1% interest rate), or is it best to keep it in an online account (e.g. Betterment.com's safety net accounts)?

Details: 

I am 34, wife is 32. I work full time while she is finishing her PhD. The only debt we have is for a car we purchased last year when our jeep finally decided to fall apart beyond repair.  We use credit cards for about 95% of our purchases and pay off the statement balance in full every month.

I have a Roth IRA through my current employer (no employer matching or anything like that because we are a 2 person firm) that I max out every year.  I also have two 401k accounts from previous employers and I am in the process of rolling those over into a Roth IRA.

We also have a savings account with ~$20k sitting in it and contribute ~1,100/month. (of course emergencies always come up so the balance varies). 

I think we are in pretty good shape.  We have an emergency fund and we have a retirement fund. The next step is to open an investment account (I'm researching who to go through now). The plan is to start with an initial investment of $10K (from our savings account). That money will be invested in stock heavy Index Funds willing to accept a decent amount of risk with this money).  We will also be doing monthly contributions (part of the $1,100 we have been putting into savings go into the investment fund but we are not sure exactly how much yet).

That leaves us with a hefty chunk of change in our savings account (~$10k).  I agree that it is very important to keep 4-6 months living expenses saved up and easily accessible, but I think is a waste to keep that money in a savings account where we earn 0.10% interest. I feel that we are basically loosing money by keeping so much of it in that account.  While I was doing some research I stumbled across Betterment.com and they offer a ""safety net"" account which is primarily bond heavy (low risk) that earns ~4%.  From reading the FAQ it looks like you can transfer money into and out of this account with no fees and it takes the usual 4-6 business days to happen.  As I mentioned earlier, we have excellent credit and use our our credit card for nearly everything. In the past, when an emergency has come up we would pay for it using the credit card then transfer money from savings into checking to cover the credit card bill when it comes.  I cannot think of a time since we have been together (6-7 years) where we have needed immediate access to cash. 

So, to me this Betterment ""safety net"" account looks like a good idea. In my research I found a few reviews (on lifehacker of all places) of people who do the same thing, use Betterment as their rainy day/savings account and keep a low ""cash"" balance in their checking/savings accounts.

However, my wife isn't too keen on the idea.  She wants to keep the bulk of the remaining $10k as cash in the savings account.  After talking about it for a while I believe we have come to a compromise of leaving ~$3k in the savings account and move the rest (~$7k) into a Betterment-type account.  I guess I'm OK with that, but it still feels like we are ""losing"" money via interest vs. inflation (FYI, is is VERY risk averse).

So, what are your opinions? Do any of you have experience with an online ""safety net"" account?  What are the positives and drawbacks? Should we keep some cash in our savings account and if so do you have any recommendations as to how much?",finance,1422304997

personalfinance,"UPDATE: 1.5 months in working 2 jobs to pay off student loans &amp; credit cards ~ 85 hrs/week - credit score is up, debt is down, life is...hard.","About a month ago I posted on here about the 2nd job I took at a restaurant in an attempt to pay down my debt &amp; credit cards.   I received several messages from people considering doing the same thing asking me to update them how its working out.
[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2qpv38/just_started_my_second_job_to_pay_down_my_debt/) is the original post.

For those too lazy to read it..I'm 25 years old, and my full time job is as an Analyst for a Private Equity firm, making $40K base + $8k bonus (split up into monthly payments).  I've been working for the company nearly 2 years now, and still haven't received any raise.  I had about $55,000 in debt, maxed out all my credit cards, with payments that were pretty much causing me to overdraft my account every month.   FICO was 640 as of the date of the original posting.     So, I decided to take up a 2nd job as a bus boy at a nearby restaurant for supplementary income...bumping my work week to around 85 hours.


Well, 1.5 months in, and financially I'm definitely in a better place. Physically/emotionally...its a mixed bag.  During the week I generally work at the office from around 9:30am - 6:30pm. I work at the restaurant Friday - Sunday.  My schedule there usually starts with running home from the office Friday night, getting changed, and heading right to the restaurant without pause. I work there till around 3am. Saturdays I have to come in to open at 9:30am, and do a double shift until around 1am. Then I work Sunday Brunch from 9:30am to around 5pm.   Sunday nights are really my only time off.

Besides the 2nd job, I've taken some other actions to better manage my budget each month.

- I put my low-interest Federal Consolidated Loan on temporary forebearance. My goal is to pay off my high interest CCs first, so deferring my loan leaves me an extra several hundred in cash to put towards my high interest credit cards.

-  I got a new quote on car insurance which cuts my payment down around $85 a month.

- I have a few late payment hits on my credit score due to bounced transactions. So I came up with the idea to take all of my accounts off auto-debit, wait several months, and then try to negotiate with the card companies to remove the late payments from my history in exchange for turning on auto withdrawl.

- I'm working on paying off my lowest interest card first  as soon as possible, which offers a 0% APR balance transfer for the first year  I'm then going to transfer the balance on my highest interest card, so that I can pay it down with no additional interest over the next year. 

- I reworked my budget, &amp; changed the due date on some of my bills so that the expenses are now split more evenly between the first and second halves of the month. This makes it easier on my bank account between paychecks.


So, heres how its working out so far.

The Pros:

* I'm pulling in about an extra $250 a weekend. About $100-$120 in cash tips. The rest goes on a bi weekly paycheck. I get paid from my full time job bi weekly as well, and they are staggered so that I'm receiving a paycheck from one or the other every week. Always having cash in my pocket without having to hit the ATM is pretty awesome too.

*  Between the extra income, &amp; loan forbearance, I managed to put roughly $1500 extra towards debt payments last month.

*  FICO as of January 21st has jumped 25 points to 665.

* I haven't come close to overdrafting the account since starting, &amp; am finally not stressed out about money. Even able to save some towards a vacation sometime this year.

* Working weekends has dramatically cut down on my spending money at bars/restaurants, since I'm not really going out anymore. I also receive several free meals from the restaurant every weekend.

* I have some job security, knowing if I get laid off from my main job for whatever reason, I at least will be able to eat.

* I'm getting pretty damn strong from lifting tables &amp; bus bins for 8 -18 hours - 3 days straight

Cons:

* Being a bus boy at a busy, high-end restaurant is tough work. Its a lot of heavy lifting, running around, and pretty much all other staff from managers, to chefs, to the servers shit on you.  I wake up every day in moderate pain from my herniated disc.  I was told when I started working that I'd be able to get promoted to a different position, but so far I haven't been offered anything.

* My schedule is pretty insane on the weekends. I don't have time to do really anything else but work, and catch a few hours of sleep. Its mentally exhausting. 

* Some of my relationships with friends have also suffered since I can't really hang out with them much anymore. 

* My sleep schedule is completely fucked. By monday I'm pretty much mentally and physically exhausted. Oddly enough, I have began to view the regular work week as my new ""weekend"", since the hours aren't nearly as strenuous. Sometimes I feel like a zombie, whose only purpose is work. 

* Anecdotally, its hard for me to relate to many fellow employees at the restaurant, and feel kind of like an outsider there. Most of them know this is just a second job for me, and probably resent me some for that. Some of the older employees have worked there over 13 years....theres not much I have in common with them from a career/life aspiration standpoint. Here I am a 25 year old bus boy probably making more than my own managers. I don't feel like many of them like me too much. But then again, maybe that's in part due to my social anxiety disorder.
 

So in summary, I think doing this is the right move, and is helping me dig myself out of the hole, but I definitely won't be able to do it for too long. I figure I'll be able to stick it out about 6 months to a year, and hopefully will be in a much more comfortable place financially by then (assuming I haven't lost my mind). I've calculated that I should at least be able to pay off all of my credit cards, and take a good chunk out of my private higher-interest student loans...and even take a vacation or two abroad to save my mental sanity.

Ask me any questions if you're curious.

**Edit** There seems to be a lot of confusion about  my salary in this position.

Currently in grace |6/2015| $56,500  | 7.04%, 6.8%, 5.41% | $4,040
In school |12/2015| $95,700 | 6.8%, 5.41% | $6,680


I estimate that the ""in school"" loans will accrue an additional $5000 in interest prior to capitalizing, and the grace period loans will accrue $1300 more before they capitalize.

**Goals for this year:**

1. Pay off/down high interest credit cards
2.  Pay student loan interest before it capitalizes
3. Maximize IRA contributions (if appropriate)

We've started using YNAB and love how it's helping keep us in line and reducing our spending. I used the extra cash from my final financial aid payment to get us living on last month's income. Our emergency fund is funded, and we have about $4k cash that is unallocated, with an additional $3k if we only move half a month ahead using the YNAB method (we're OK with this if we have to). 

My thought was to either pay off the $2,900 credit card or make a 2014 IRA contribution with this money (perhaps both if I release that extra $3k). Since I was a student last year, I only earned enough to make up to a $3200 IRA contribution for 2014. My thinking was that an extra year of contributions compounded over 50+ years would outperform any other use for my cash (including paying down other debt), but I'm unsure about this logic. 

Moving forward, our budget leaves us with around $1800/month to put into savings and debt reduction. I know we won't be able to pay off every card immediately and still pay off the loan interest before it capitalizes, but we want to tackle as much as we can. 

**Questions I'm struggling to answer:**

1. Should I bother chasing the $3200 2014 IRA contribution? Would an extra year of contributions compounded over 50+ years be a better return than using the cash on other debt?

2. Am I crazy to even try to fund our IRAs in 2015?

3. If/when we open IRAs, is it better to go traditional or Roth? We will only be under the Roth income limits while I'm in residency (6 years), but starting in 2016 my fiance will have a 401k (profit sharing only, no match %), so we may make too much to take the deduction on a traditional (assuming my job offers a retirement plan too). I'm leaning towards a Roth, with plans to do a backdoor Roth once we are over the income limit, but I realize we make more than the amount that Roths are usually recommended for. There is also potential to get a few years of deductions with a traditional. I have no idea what tax bracket we will be in at retirement, and the other benefits of the Roth are moot for us.

4. What is the best way to prioritize our liabilities? Should we transfer most of the CC debt to 0% offers, pay down the balances still accruing interest, then tackle the student loan interest head on before it capitalizes? We could revisit the 0% balances next year once we make a dent in the student loan interest. Or should we use all available cash to pay off the interest on the loans that capitalize in June? 

5. At what point is it worth it to contribute to an IRA (if ever) when you have student loans to pay off?

personalfinance,Hey Personal Finance! Looking for some advice on my current vehicle situation from some folks who are good with money.,"I have a 2008 VW Rabbit that I bought used, financed as a 60 month loan through my Credit Union with a pretty good interest rate.  I had gone through a hand-me-down and a cheap junker that inevitably broke and became money pits, so I wanted a good car that would last, this was around 2-3 years ago when I bought the car.  

Fast forward to today, I've moved pretty close to where I work, and financially I am feeling very strapped with higher student loan payments, having to pay for healthcare (cheaper through ACA than my employer), along with other expenses.  

I don't make a ton of money (34K a year) but I get by and live within my means just fine.  I really want to start taking bigger chunks out of my student debt, so I've contemplated getting rid of my car and buying a bike instead to commute to work.  I've talked with my SO whom I live with, and we've both agreed that when needed we can share her car as she doesn't have a car payment.  

I paid around 11.5K for the car used, with very low miles, and have around 8.7K left on the loan.  I pay $130/mo in insurance, and roughly $60 in gas.  I've looked up what the car is worth now on Kelly Blue Book (around 6K), and I'm just scratching my head to figure out the best way for me to get out of this financial strangle hold (speaking just of the car here) without being taken to the cleaners.  Is the KBB value what I can realistically sell it for?  I've seen the exact same model and year go for much more on various websites, so I'm just a little confused.  

I guess my main question is what's the best way for me to proceed?  Should I continue making payments on the car until I owe only what it's worth then get rid of it?  I feel like the longer I keep it the more money I'm wasting away when I could be saving and biking.  But at the same time, selling it now and making payments on it while I don't even have it seems like a bad idea too.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,How to best approach my student debt,"Hello,

I'm 29 years old, make $40K gross a year, and have made a ton of very stupid financial mistakes so far.  My credit score is awful, I have some debt in collections, and I have a really high amount of student debt ($106K+).  After going back for my masters, I have just recently started repaying my loans and am struggling to make the payments on top of my other expenses.  I am in the process of working with a debt counselor to help me address my budget and debt in collections, but am seeking some advice on how to best approach repaying my student loans.  Below is some information on my loans:

* Consolidated Federal Loan @ 6.125% interest = $86,882.13 
* Monthly Payment (IBR Plan) = $260.00

.

* Perkins Loan = $1,036.38
* Monthly Payment = $40

.

* Private Loan @ 10.25% = $6,397.64.
* Monthly Payment = $60

.

* Private Loan @ 10.25% = $4,522.41.
* Monthly Payment = $50.

.

* Private Loan @ 5% = $7,757.63
* Monthly Payment = $175 (must be paid back in 6 years - should be paid back in 4 at this rate)

. 

* Total Current Student Loan Debt = $106,569.19

. 

* Tax Return = $1,575.03.  

I have been struggling with my finances and there isn't much wiggle room (according to my debt counselor).  I guess I'm wondering what the best way to approach my loans would be.  Given that my federal loans are on an IBR plan, would it be a good idea to put them on forbearance for 12 months and use that $260 (plus tax refund) a month towards my other loans?  If so, I know the general advice is to attack the highest interest ones first, but doing so would only free up $50 in my budget by the end of the year.  Would it be a better idea to use that $260, along with the $175 and pay off my 5% interest private loan.  Then, come off of forbearance, start the $260 payments for the federal, and then use the freed up $175 (along with my next tax refund) to start paying down those two high interest loans?


Also, I plan to move in with a roommate this August and free up $300-350 a month in expenses that I could use towards any loan.

Now my problem is that I do not have a W2 or tax return, but I think I maybe should have one. For several years (2012-2013) I worked as a volunteer for a missions organization. As volunteers we had to support ourselves through personal finances or donations. To get a tax break for donors however, the donations had to be made out to the organization and then the organization would ""pay"" us, legally speaking, as a private contractor, so at the end of the year we got a 1099 Misc. form that we filed on. 

For the first year I broke the tax thresh-hold and filed and payed. I don't recall ever getting any forms back or anything. 

For the second year, I left the organization before the 1099's came out. I don't believe I broke the tax threshold but do think I was supposed to get a 1099 anyways so I gave them my new address and left. I never got anything from them. 

Fast forward to now, I've been in Korea since then and do not have any official income here (my wife does). I have no idea what to report with all this, nor how to find out if I owe anything to the IRS, or how to get a tax return, or anything.

That being said, I am not sure exactly how to divy up my current savings and income to be as cautious as possible while still aggressively paying off student debt.

I just turned 23. I started my first full-time job this summer at $33,280 annually (before taxes). My current expenses are minimal -- gas, groceries, and a $50 monthly car insurance payment. Currently living at home and contributing $50 per pay check into a TDA for retirement (plan to increase once I make more money).

My student loans (2) total about $74,000. My tactic when they went into repayment last month was to lower them to the lowest possible monthly obligation for emergency purposes. However, I plan to pay $1,000/month towards them (about double the obligation), as well as any remaining income at the end of each month.

The issue that I continue to go back and forth with is my savings. Right now I have $30,000 in a savings account (very low interest rate). I have come to a pretty definitive conclusion that I should bite the bullet and forego a large chunk of this and put it toward the higher loan with the higher interest rate. My question is - how much? 

If I drop $20,000 into my loans in one shot, I will still have about $54,000 of debt left. This is the discouraging factor because this amount is still so high, yet I would deplete my savings to a mere $10,000. I am aware of the need for only ""emergency"" savings (which $30k certainly exceeds), but I would really appreciate some reassurance on this if possible. Should I invest the money some other way?

My monthly pay boils down to about $2,000 if that helps put things in perspective.

personalfinance,Large house repair/job uncertainty,"I recently had to replace my main sewer line a few weeks ago and the bills (going to be around $4600) are finally rolling in for it.

It has taken me years to get that money saved up as I'm a single parent who isn't getting any support from my child's father.  


I get paid ok where I work, however there is a quite high chance the company will be relocating within the next two years.  If that were to happen I would NOT relocate without a significant (approx. 50%) raise and the chance of that happening is slim as well.

I'm keeping this money in savings because I want to be able to max my 401k out when I begin to work (if I'm allowed to? I don't know the intricacies of a 401k), which is in late June, halfway through the year.

I'm fumbling about trying to plan my expenses as best I can, assuming I'll make $120k a year including bonuses. (Does the stock I may gain count as income towards taxes? That would change the numbers a bit.) I could be estimating my taxes incorrectly, because I'm honestly not so sure. I'll be in CA (hard to guess where in California with these numbers, eh?), so state income tax is far from negligible.

* Pre-tax investment: Max 401k -&gt; $100k left.
* Taxes: ~$20k federal, ~$10k state -&gt; $70k left.
* Rent: ~$25k/yr (hopefully not! but time shall tell...) -&gt; $45k left.
* Utilities, internet: ~$5k/yr -&gt; $40k left.

I think this is a fairly reasonable estimate of my future costs. Please let me know if I'm forgetting anything obvious in my predicted costs.

I don't really feel the need to make my 2015 return that complicated, so is there a way to override TaxAct to manually elect to take the standard deduction in 2014? I don't see any buttons that will allow me to do that. If not, is accounting for the state refund in 2015 that difficult?

personalfinance,"Just received $3,000+ in Federal Student Aid; in need of advice in where to deposit it","Forewarned, I am completely and utterly inept with money matters. The most money I've ever hand to handle was $200 and it stayed in an envelope in my closet until the fateful day when... it's too horrible to describe; let's move on.

As the title says, I have just received some odd $3,000+ in federal student aid money but am unsure how I should go about keeping it secure/where I should put it. The aid came with the option to open up a /non-interest/ account with Higher One; now I'm more than willing to open said account; however, I already have an account with a local credit union (Ventura County Credit Union- if that helps in anyway) that I'm sure pays decent interest on deposits. My thought is that instead of letting the money sit in a non-interest account (designed explicitly for the students who received the aid) I could put it into my credit union account where it can garnish some interest on the side. Here are the problems as I see them though:

1) Can I do this?
---There was an option in which I could transfer the money to a third party /bank/. I've no knowledge in the technicalities so in this case is a credit union a form of bank?

2) Should I do this?
---I feel this might seem shady to someone looking in (maybe I'm naive but the credit union building was, in my opinion, very upscale. Not the kind of place you expect a broke college student to have money [A GIGANTIC PILE OF CASH THE WHOLE OF WHICH AMOUNTS TO A STAGGERING $50!]) such as if I've pocketed the money and now don't plan on continuing in college.

3) Would this effect my status as a broke college student? (dependent)
---In all seriousness how would such a move affect my financial... report? Reputation? I don't have a job so I've no income; as such I'm listed as a dependent. Could this possibly do anything to my dependency status?

3.a) Could this and if so how would this effect the federal aid my mother receives?
---Being in college, being a dependent and most of all having fuck-all in terms of capital has likely been, in part, a minor factor in my mother's ability to receive certain federal aids. Would putting this money into a credit union account cause her to possibly lose some of these benefits? (My thought is next time she needs to report finances she'll be required to disclose the money I put in the credit union account and that will inadvertently cause her to lose said benefits)

personalfinance,Have lots of credit card debt that I can't afford to pay - how do I proceed?,"I lost my job during the economic shit show in 2008. Did not work for over a year. Then had short term jobs between 2009 and 2011, never anything that lasted (I work in a notoriously unstable industry). When I wasn't working, I was able to get unemployment extensions, but eventually these ran out too -- not long after I got myself into an expensive lease with a very big apartment leasing corporation, so I couldn't get out of it without paying them more money than I had. 

In retrospect, I see that I should have been alarmed the first time I used a credit card to pay for groceries or gas. But I kept thinking a break would come in the form of long-term employment. It never did. By the time I realized I was in over my head, I was $20k in debt across 5 credit cards, and I could only afford to pay the minimums on each card. With interest rates nearing 30% on each, the minimums weren't making a dent. I was paying hundreds of dollars a month to stay just as poor as I was the month before.

Finally, I was flat broke, sold my car to pay one more hail mary month of rent, and when it came to choosing between buying eggs and paying a credit card, the eggs won. I eventually had to break my lease (and moved back home with my parents to avoid eviction proceedings), which I'm not proud of, so the leasing company immediately sold the lease-break charge ($3000) and about $500 of unnecessary cleaning fees to a collections agency.  

Credit card companies started calling me, and eventually collections agencies. I had nothing at all to bargain with, no means by which to pay them, so I just didn't answer the calls. I'd also been warned not to make payment arrangements with collections agencies because it refreshes the 7-year life of the debt until it's paid off. The last time I checked my credit report, I had about 6 items that are slated to drop off my report in December 2019. That includes the apartment debt.

I had a job for a year (2013-2014) that paid decently, but I had to dig myself out of five years of not buying clothes, tech, haircuts, or basic living necessities just so I could show up at my office every day and not get laughed at. Still could not afford to pay off the debt. Then I got laid off and have been on unemployment, living frugally (literally, in an RV that was given to me, on free public land, no rent right now), but still cannot afford to pay off the debt and comfortably feed/house myself.

I am asking you to please refrain from judgment about past decisions and give me some advice about how to proceed. I WANT to be debt free. I want to get back to my glory days of getting 0% credit cards thrown at me because I had an 800+ credit score. I don't want to get blackballed from buying a home or getting a car loan when I'm 40 (I'm 29, if it matters). But I will never tackle this debt unless I can pay it in big chunks -- and I don't know how I would be able to do that unless I landed a six figure job with good benefits. I'm kind of resigned to the idea that this debt is just going to stay where it is until 2019. (Yes, I am constantly trying to improve my skill set, looking for work [even in other industries], looking for ways to supplement my income, and trying to cut costs. If anything, my biggest barrier to securing work is probably that I'm insecure and kind of a square peg -- I'm good at what I do, just not a shmoozer and don't promote myself well. I am working on this. If a well-paying gig comes along, I'll reconsider how to pay the debt.)

So ultimately my questions are these...

1. What will happen to my credit score when these delinquent accounts fall off in 2019? Will it go up? How much? (Ever to the point of ""Good"" or ""Excellent""?) Will I still get denied for things like a home loan?

2. Say I do land a good job and think I can pay each account off in one chunk. Is it worth it to open a dialogue with the collections agencies? Or are they really as evil as everyone says?

3. I had two minors (age 5) who were on the lease for the apartment with me (so they could be considered residents rather than guests). All mail I've gotten in regards to that debt is addressed to the three of us. While they won't turn 18 till long after December 2019, will this debt follow them in any way? The collections agency shouldn't have their SSNs or anything, but their names are uncommon enough that a good sleuth could attach the debt to them I'm sure. I keep seeing people here find that they have an item on their credit report that dates back to when they were a minor, and I sure don't want these kids to inherit a problem that isn't theirs.

Sorry for the wall of text - just trying to give enough info to weed out the ""give up your daily latte and pay off the debt"" comments, because that's really not the heart of the issue here. I truly welcome your insight!",finance,1422327578

personalfinance,Good Job - Mountains of Debt - Quality of Life fine - What am I missing?,"Gonna crosspost in /r/studentloans. So first off, I'm writing this post out of a sincere concern for the future.  This is not an attempt to showboat (not that I think there is anything below worth being exceptionally proud of). Nor am I looking for sarcastic responses suggesting that I have rethought past choices.  I have to work with what I currently have. Most of the following is build up, so bear with me. Just want to provide a complete picture. 

I'm in my fourth year of work as an attorney. This year I'll make $102,000 with a discretionary bonus (which I'll estimate as $10,000 just for the sake of argument).  My monthly take home after my firm deducts health care premium and a max 401k contribution (6% with 3% match) is approximately $5,200. I have about $14,000 in the bank currently.  I have about $4,200 in credit card debt (of which $3,700 is interest free on promotion). As for the remaining $500, I'm throwing about $100 a month at it to get rid of it. The credit card debt is a combination of Best Buy, clothing store and furniture store debt. In all, I am probably putting $300 a month towards that credit card debt. 

I own a house in a relatively low cost of living area of the country. I currently owe about $168,000 on my house which I financed for 30 years at 3.75%. I've been in the house since May 2013. My monthly mortgage payment (with PMI) is about $1190. I put some money into my home when I first bought it (kitchen renovations), so I expect I could sell it in the $190,000 range if necessary.  I currently lease a BMW (up in April 2017) with a monthly payment of about $540. I also pay your normal usage for gas, insurance (house and auto) as well as a small life insurance premium and supplemental disability income insurance. Those insurance premiums for non house and auto are about $60.00 a month. 

I probably spend $1500-2000 on basic living a month (food, entertainment, dry cleaner, medical, misc drug store/hardware store purchases, etc.) I used to track my expenses to the dollar but got away from it when I started traveling for work a good bit and it became an annoyance. I have a girlfriend so have the normal expenses associated with that. Other than my 401k contribution, I'm not really saving much it seems, but I'd need to look at that closer with some expense tracking. All in all, I'm not in a bad spot. I take trips when I want to. I'm never prevented from buying something because I can't afford it. (Normal items, not silly stuff like $1000 shoes). 

So what's the problem? Well I have about $250k in student loan debt. $25k or so from undergrad with the balance from law school and some re-capitalized interest during some early periods of forbearance. It's all government student loan debt (no private lenders) with an average weighted interest rate of 7.4% (horrid).  I'm on an income based repayment plan now (based on my debt to income ratio) where I pay about $1,000 a month. This doesn't even cover the approximately $1500/mo in interest that is accruing. So every month I'm paying $1000 just to be only $500 worse than the month before. The only ""light"" at the end of the tunnel is that after 25 years of this, it all gets forgiven (currently in the form of taxable debt forgiveness).  The thing is, if I were to put $2000/mo towards the loans, I don't make an appreciable dent in it to move the needle in my favor and still end up paying for 20+ years while being more miserable due to having less income to use for things I could use. Short of living in a hovel, biking to work, and eating ramen for 10 years (while throwing $4000 a month at the loans), I don't see a way out of this crippling debt. Call it vanity, call it pride, but I'm not going to live a sad and miserable life for 10 years. I just wish there were a solution to get the debt paid off in a reasonable fashion without sacrificing my entire life to do so. 

Do I simply keep paying the minimum amount and hope that legislation down the road somehow alleviates the problem? (No guarantees.) If I can predict and plan for a large taxable event some 25 years from now, perhaps I can mitigate its effects.",finance,1422328790

financialindependence,FI and low-income benefits--how does this work in practice?,"Hypothetical scenario in which FI is achieved: 30k/year withdrawn from investment assets + 10k/year from self-employment/odd jobs/part time work = 40k/year total.

I believe I'm correct in assuming that, depending on tax deductions &amp; dependents, this scenario would potentially result in a negative federal tax rate and qualify one for highly subsidized ACA health insurance (or maybe Medicaid), among other policies aimed at lower-income filers. 

How does this impact FI planning?  Today I was playing around with various income scenarios trying to understand their impact. It seems ACA, all on its own, has an enormous effect.  Health insurance premiums are a major burden (on par with rent in my case), but as income declines, subsidies take over.  I could hypothetically ""afford"" to live on $x less per year income given the subsidies will rise by ~$x amount, negating the income loss.  Eventually you could fall into Medicaid territory and receive even cheaper health care, and it seems the ACA eliminated assets testing for Medicaid qualification (if my reading is correct).  

There's also the EITC to consider.  Essentially (using various online calculators) I noticed that as I dropped my hypothetical income, policies like the EITC and ACA meant I didn't actually *need* as much income to meet my needs.  Is this a typical part of the FI scenario?  Is it possible to have significant retirement assets and yet be ""poor"" as far as the goverment is concerned?  Are there FI ""best practices"" for taking into account these considerations?  Are there ethical concerns at play here?",finance,1422329661
personalfinance,Question regarding Puerto Rico bank accounts,"Hello world! Had a question about filing federal taxes. I have an account in a PR bank account that sends me a 480a form (for PR income tax filing). I'm wondering if I need to report the interest from that in my federal return. And if I do, would it be as 'regular' bank account interest? Or is PR considered international? H&amp;R Block software doesn't list PR as a possible 'country' when choosing country for foreign bank account reporting but other software doesn't limit selection to a pre-set list of countries, thus my confusion. 

 I am a full time Massachusetts resident, for what it's worth. People in PR don't file federal taxes, so I don't know if that makes a difference. The interest is reported in a 480a form for the PR tax return,  not a 1099-int or the international bank account equivalent. 

This bank account came into being in 2013 so last year, filing for 2013, this question caused me enough concern to use an agent at a physical H&amp;R Block locale. He took the numbers from the PR form and plugged them in as a 1099 int. I wasn't satisfied paying money for him doing what I was probably going to do, so I am closing to do them myself this year. 

From my limited knowledge, it would seem that I don't report the interest on the federal form at all, and have to file a PR return. Any thoughts? All help welcome.

personalfinance,"Emergency: use credit, or emergency fund first?","There is common wisdom here - do not rely on revolving credit for an emergency fund. This makes sense, because credit can be withdrawn at any time, without reason. This is important advice with which I agree wholeheartedly.

But let's say it's an emergency - you've lost your job. At this moment, you've got X months worth of expenses in cash, and Y months worth of expenses in credit. Would you use the credit first, or the cash first? Using credit means paying interest long term. But the longer you spend cash, the more likely it is you'll run out, *and* the more likely your credit line will be withdrawn.

This is a complicated question (as far as I can tell), because it depends immensely on X and Y, as well as interest rates and your projected time unemployed (and ability to get a job at your previous income level). I'm guessing if you have say, one month of cash and twelve months credit, it would be wise to use credit first. If you have 12 months cash and 1 month credit, you should probably use cash first.

I'd appreciate any opinions on this idea overall, as well as individual guidelines for X and Y values (etc).

personalfinance,My bank says its $31 Courtesy Pay fee for overdrawn transactions is federally mandated. Is this true?,"To be a bit clearer, I'm with a credit union, rather than a bank.

Normally, overdrawn transactions on one account would simply take from another account or a credit card (only one with the credit union, though). But, since I'm a Canadian living in the US with no credit history, I wasn't able to get a credit card with the credit union. So, if I don't keep track of my account, I'll start getting overdrawn and charged fees for each transaction. The kicker is that I'm only notified that I'm overdrawn 36 hours later - meaning that I'll rack up something in the range of $310 worth of fees for 10 small transactions before I realize what's going on.

I know it's on me to keep better track of my money, but I also want to know more about this $31 fee. I spoke with two agents of the credit union, and their explanations for the fee differed: one said it went directly to the credit union to support its operations, whereas the other said it was a federally mandated fee that went directly to the federal government.

investing,After 10 years of investment grade rating from S &amp; P lost again,"On Monday, after the close of trading, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the sovereign credit rating of the Russian Federation to the ""speculative"" level ""BB +"". This event was to be expected in view of the growing geopolitical risks. Back in April last year SnP downgraded to 'BBB-' - this is a step up speculative. And in December, put on a downward revision to the ""negative"" outlook.

SnP first drew attention to Russia nearly 20 years ago - in 1996. Then the agency assigned the country rating of ""BB-"" - lower level of speculative category. And soon the default level was, in fact, Russia and defaulted. In 2005 alone, the state reached the level of investment according to the agency, and 10 years later lose it again.

The other two international rating agencies will review Russia's sovereign rating in 2-3 months and is likely to also lower it to the ""speculative"" category. According to investment declarations, while two of the three agencies continue to hold an investment grade rating, foreign funds have the right to invest in a variety of debt instruments of the country.

  All negativity from the downgrade again it will feel the Russian currency, but the stock market this event virtually invisible. On Tuesday, the Russian ruble may find support at around 69-70 against the dollar. Do not forget that in the event of a downgrade of Russia two of the three rating agencies, with Russian companies can be claimed repayment of debts in the amount of 25-30 billion. Dollars. Also do not forget that in the case of a downgrade of the Russian Federation for one more step, a country may be excluded from the international index of MSCI. The remaining two agencies also follow the example of SnP- is only a matter of time. Unfortunately, yesterday's decision SnP looks more political than fundamental, but there is also a good point - trumps for threats and blackmail the United States is becoming less.

We are waiting for a negative opening on ruble MICEX index with losses in the range of 1% and the RTS index with losses of 3-4%.

personalfinance,Thinking about buying a house before prices and rates increase - am I wrong to try to time the market?,"Hello PF. I've been reading for a few months, and want to say I love the advice here.  I understand the advice that timing the market is not the best approach and that ""time in the market beats timing the market.""  I agree with that principle and stick to it for purposes of investing (401K, IRA, taxable accounts etc. - I usually just stick to index funds and leave them alone - at this point I have $15K in my 401K and de minimis amounts in anything else - I just graduated from grad school and started working last year and have been paying down all my student loan debt).

A little background:  I'm 27, make $112K, have no student loan debt, but don't have any other money other than an emergency fund ($5,000) and 401K ($15,000) because I just finished paying my student loan debt aggressively (~70K in under two years).  The lease on my current rental apartment is up in August and I was thinking about buying a condo in the city I live in.  I am interested in something between $250,000 to $325,000.  I currently pay $1050 in rent/month and live with 2 roommates.  They probably don't want to extend the lease after its up in August, so I would have to deal with finding new roommates and moving somewhere for another year, or finding my own place to rent which would be ~$1,500 or so in my area.

By August, when I would theoretically want to move in to a new place, I could probably have $15 - $20K saved up, but that is no where near the 20% down payment that is often recommended on here.  I am worried about signing my lease for another year because (1) according to the Case Shiller Home Price Index, home prices appear to be on the rebound and (2) it is generally expected that interest rates will begin rising this year.

I know that 20% down payment is recommended to avoid PMI, but if PMI is 0.5% tacked on to my mortgage, wouldn't that be the same as locking in that increase in mortgage rates vs. waiting it out and having rates increase perhaps 1% or more by Summer 2016? (i.e., if I can get a mortgage now for 4%, and have to pay .5% for PMI for a total of 4.5%, isn't that better than risking rates go up above 4.5% by the time I get out of another year's lease in Summer 2016?

I don't want to be one of those people that asks a question on reddit but is really just looking for confirmation of what they were going to do anyway. I come here with an open mind and sincerely appreciate the answers.  I don't want to be a hypocrite and ignore the advice that I believe in and have internalized (dont try to time the market), but am also worried about missing out on a good opportunity to buy.  

Your advice is greatly appreciated.  Thank you all in advance",finance,1422362564
personalfinance,How and Should I Refinance,"Hi PF,
I am trying to get my financial house in order before interest rates go back up. I am currently 1.5 years into a 15 year mortgage @ 2.75% with ~240k balance. I also have a HELOC with $67k @ ~4% (i forget the exact number) that is adjustable and I am guessing will start to shoot up. I am considering my options and trying to figure out where to go from here. I see the following choices:

1) Refinance the HELOC into a fixed mortgage (20 years?). The issue with this is that the interest rates tend to be higher, and the extra 500-700 a month will make it a bit of a hardship.

2) Do nothing, and try to pay down the HELOC. I don't think I can put more than $300 a month at the moment.

3) Refinance everything into a 30 year mortgage. I have been shopping around and it looks like I could get a $350k loan at 30 years, for what I am paying on the 15, with the benefit of getting an extra ~40k to put into a saving account for an emergency (I have no emergency fund :( ) This option is a bummer because of the history of the loans, I don't think I can get interest deductions over ~260k and also it makes the term much longer.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what path I should take? If I take option 1 or 2, the extra money basically comes out of savings/paying myself. I do max out my HSA, and get my 401k match, and my wife is probably over her 401k match by $3000 a year, so there is another source of money but I hate to touch retirement money.

personalfinance,Refund due/tax owed discrepancy between TurboTax and TaxAct,"I've been testing out TaxAct this year to compare results against TurboTax. I don't have all my forms yet, but I've entered what I do have in both systems so far. The estimated state tax refund/amount owed is exactly the same in both systems, but the Federal is off by about $50. Is there any explanation for this? Anyone else come across this issue before? I've double and triple-checked all the forms to ensure accuracy. 


UPDATE: OP delivers. Figured it out. If you took an itemized deduction and got a state tax refund, TurboTax factors in your previous year's return into your Federal taxable income. Don't forget to enter your 1099-G if you got a refund last year!

personalfinance,"Student Loans are locked in at 1%, am I crazy for only making minimum payments??","Long story short, I have ~$54k in student loans, and just found out my 1% interest rate that I thought was only applicable for a short term lowered payment plan is locked in. It's sounding like that's for the life of the loan, but even assuming it will go up at *some* point, 1% is a fuckin STEAL.  
  
I'm not really good with math. I understand the concept of compound interest, inflation, etc. I know the standard advice around here is if a loan has an interest rate lower than 3%-ish, your money is better off in a retirement account where it will earn more. But, again, interest rates and compound interest aren't my strong suit.  
  
I'm guessing/assuming, with the 1% interest rate it would be in my best interest to stash away as much as I can into other accounts. Hoping you all can help me with the math on that decision.  
  
My current expenses are below; I am moving in March, so I've included my expected expenses going forward from then as well.  
  
**Yearly Pay (pre-tax):** $31,200  
  
**Take Home Pay (bi-weekly):** ~$900  
  
**401k:** ~$50/paycheck (no employer matching)  
  
**Student Loans:** $54,000 @ 1% interest  
  
**Total Currently in Savings:** $3,059
  

Expense | Amount | 
:--------|:--------|
**Food** | $300  | 
**Rent &amp; Utilities** | $338 (current); ~$500 starting in March | 
**Car Payment** | $153.41  | 
**Car Insurance** | $139.92 | 
**Gas** | $50  |
**Cell Phone** | $78  |
**Personal Items** | $50  |  
**Student Loan Payment** | $181.62 | 
**""Fun""** | $150  |   
**TOTAL (with higher rent)** | **$1,602.95**  |    
  
*Personal Items and Fun are a little high this month (because of the lower rent currently).*  
  
So I've got an extra ~$200-400/month. Plus yearly bonuses (this year's was $2,500 after tax). 
  
Is it even worth making bigger payments on my student loans? I put it into unbury.me and with my current payments and interest it'll be paid off in 2043 (2044 per Navient). That'll make me 56 by the time they're paid off. But if interest rates work out in my favor, paying $181/month for another 30 years really doesn't bother me. Is it a better option to put all that extra money in an IRA?   
  
Also, for what it's worth, I *do* have the 1% interest in writing. Not just on my loan repayment schedule, but in an actual letter response from Navient after I asked about it.   
  
  
**ETA:** I have an HSA account as well. I'm honestly not 100% sure how that works or factors into things. $40-50 per paycheck goes to that.",finance,1422367358

personalfinance,Report Identity Theft as Soon as It Occurs,"If you’re one of the almost ten million people who fall victim to identity theft one of the keys in getting the situation resolved satisfactorily is to report it immediately. The problem here is that you may not be aware of the theft until you apply for credit and are turned down, yet you know you’ve always paid your bills timely. Or, a gruff bill collector informs you he’s about to repossess your car unless you pay up today. You try to explain that you’ve not bought a new car.

Expect to be a victim of identity theft and stay one step ahead of the process by planning.

When you report that you’re a victim, a lot of detailed information will be required. Make copies of all credit cards and social security cards. Keep a list of the numbers to call in case of theft and keep at least two copies in different locations. If your wallet is stolen, this is not a good place to keep the list.

Different types of identity thefts require notification to different authorities. You can start with your local police department but many times they will only take the information by phone or not at all.

Be persistent because some companies require a copy of the police report to initiate action. Also be specific and notify the proper company that pertains to your theft such as check theft, credit card, social security, phone service, drivers license or passport theft.

If your credit card has been stolen, call the respective card company. Other agencies you may want to call include the Federal Trade Commission, Social Security Administration and the office of the Attorney General. It’s good to notify these agencies in an effort to establish if any pattern of theft is occurring.

Have all your information at the ready when reporting a theft. Keep complete records of your phone calls including time, date, who you spoke to and what was promised or determined. A theft report requires a lot of detail and the more you have when you make the call the faster the matter will be resolved.

Notify the fraud department of the three credit reporting companies. These are Experian, Equifax and Transunion. Usually call one of these companies and they will notify the other two for you. Note that some of these companies will take advantage of the opportunity to sell you credit management tools.

You can place a fraud alert for 90 days. During this time keep a close check on your credit reports and report any suspicious activity. You can request copies of your credit reports free and also a 7-year extension to the fraud alert.

Reporting an identity theft can be a long and involved process. Records show that victims can spend up to 40 hours getting the situation resolved in a satisfactory manner and the target age is between 35 and 44. A sad statistic is that almost half of identify thefts are perpetrated by someone you know, either a friend or family member. Because of this, many of the criminals go unpunished.

Most agencies are cooperative but if you do not receive satisfaction don’t hesitate to contact an attorney. Identity theft happens every day and we’re all potential victims. The best deterrent is prevention. 

After it is all said and done, you might need an attorney to clean you the mess and keep protecting you. Don't be fooled by so-called credit repair companies, get a real attorney, that knows what they are doing.",finance,1422379928
personalfinance,"Some questions about filing newly married filing taxes, IRA issues and ACA shared responsibility.","Hello PF. 

Throwaway for personal information reasons, but I'm a regular of the subreddit. I'm filing my taxes for the year and have run into a few issues that I would like to hear some opinions on.

I (33m) and my wife (26f) were married in January 2014. I also opened a Roth IRA and contributed the maximum amount for the year ($5500) and my wife plans on opening hers and doing her full contribution before April 15. My wife had qualifying medical coverage through her job for the entire 2014 year. However, my company offered no qualifying coverage. I had a ""discount plan"" type of plan that does not qualify for the ACA.

We were going to file separately because we keep most of our money in separate accounts. We have a joint account that we pay our rent, bills and save for mutual purchases with, but in general we keep our money separate.

Our combined income is about $80,000 more or less split 50/50. We have no dependents.

How much is the Federal government trying to fuck me here?

I went to TurboTax today to do my filings. The first issue I ran into was that if I want to do Married Filing Separately I am ineligible to have a Roth IRA. My understanding is that I would take a 6% penalty on my entire Roth IRA if I were to continue filing separately.

Cue calling the wife about filing jointly.

I am now looking at my Shared Responsibility Payment Worksheet for the penalty I will be owing for not having qualifying health coverage, and now that I am looking at filing jointly, they want to essentially penalize me 1% of **our** gross income (minus the filing threshold)? A difference of about $200 versus my single penalty.

Any advice here PF? Are we getting reamed for getting married? I already realized we were getting reamed with the ACA income limits for a couple with no children versus single, but it sounds like we're getting double reamed either way?",finance,1422381008

What if a combination of those two actually came together to co-opt Bitcoin. Imagine, right now, if the Fed created its own Bitcoin alt-coin (or an existing one) and then backs it with the might of their endless printing press. While in some ways that would legitimize Bitcoin and even boost Bitcoin to some degree (since converting crypto-crypto is easier than dollar to crypto) it could generally undermine Bitcoin.

I graduated this spring and only worked six months of a $48,000-a-year job. We got 8k from the federal return and 2k from state. I have two kids and my wife doesn’t work. We got a similar return last year but assumed it was large due to some one-time tax breaks or something. We did it through H&amp;R Block again this year and double-checked everything. I think I claimed 3 exemptions (wife+kids) to payroll. 


Anywho, we want to clear out as much of our debt as possible. After paying off our credit cards, we have $7,000 left we want to put towards $32,000 of our combined parents and student loan debts. 

We owe*: 

$17,600 in Student Loans (just stared paying mandatory $177.00 a month on 10 year plan)

$12,000 to my parents (no due date, unsure of what interest rate would be)

$ 2,400 to her parents (I want to pay all of this right now because, in-laws)


*Her parents lent us money to help us move to my new job this summer and my parents very generously helped us pay for a reliable car once we got here and our really old car broke down. 


My main question is how much to pay my in-laws back because I have no experience with interest rates. They gave us the money in late June of 2014 and I want to just pay it off completely so we don’t owe them anything (it was an awkward loan that I want off my back). So what is a standard/generous (to them) interest rate between family members? Do you just use whatever percent and add that percent to the outstanding amount for each month? I want them paid back in full, so there will be as little awkwardness about this as possible. 


We would love to apply the remaining ~$4k to our student loan, but that would probably be unfair to my parents who have been very nice about lending us enough money to get a newish car what doesn’t need repairs all the time. They are not wealthy or anything so it really was very generous. They are very giving because my grandparents helped them out a lot at this same time in their lives. We have little extra income each month, so this would be the only time we could pay off a large amount of any debt and we want to do whatever’s wisest.

personalfinance,26 years old and recently had a meeting with a financial planner-these were their recommendations...,"I've been a lurker for a few years, but created this account to get advice on a meeting I recently had with a financial planner from Northwestern Mutual. 

Some background- I am 26, not married, no kids. I make approx 65k/year, 10k in student loan debt, about 5k in emergency fund savings. 
My student loans have a really low interest rate so I just pay the minimum. 

Recommendations:

- continue saving approx $500/mo
- Start contributing to my 401k at work. I planned on doing this anyways. I am going to contribute up to what my employer will match.
- sign up for short term and long term disability through work
- buy $500k in term life insurance (approx $40/mo) and $500k (approx $300/mo) in whole life 
- buy extra long term disability because my work's long term disability will on pay for 60% of my base salary after taxes, and I make approx $20k (out of 65k) from commissions. She said buying extra long term disability will create coverage for approx 90% of what I make yearly and the benefit won't be taxed ($15/mo)
- eventually we will discuss investments down the road

I have read a lot of negative things about getting life insurance at my age, with no dependents, and especially about getting whole life, but what my financial planner told me was that I would be locking in my insurability (i.e. age/health) so it would be at a lower cost. I know I want to eventually buy a house and have kids, so she told me it's important to get coverage now while I am still young and healthy. Also, I like the idea of the whole life insurance because of the cash value. Does this make sense? 

Help! What should I do??

* How exactly do exemptions work? Are they basically free deductions?  If my state has a personal exemption of $5,000 for example, and I *make* $5000, I will not have to pay any taxes, right?  If I did, I would get those back? I'm assuming its the same method for federal? Which leads me to...

* During the year I paid some federal taxes.  I made around ~$9500 last year, and paid around $300 in federal taxes.  But I only paid them every other pay period (= once a month).  Is this normal? Is there an amount that ""triggers"" federal withholding?  All my other taxes appear on every pay stub.

personalfinance,Transferring my parent's mortgage into my name [Housing],"I did a search and found an overwhelming amount of people dissuading redditors from assuming their parents' mortgage. But my situation might be a little different. My parents bought their house super cheap. It's now worth about 3 times what they bought it for and also about 3 times what the mortgage balance is.

I know very little about mortgages. What I have learned is basically that my parents would probably have to sign a quit deed and I'd have to be approved by a bank to take over the mortgage. My parents have a 5.something interest rate. I have no idea what I would qualify for. 

They want to sign it over to me so that I could benefit from the tax break since I would probably benefit a lot more since they're retired and I have a well-paying career. They want it to stay in the family and then have me and my siblings benefit from its sale in the future. Since I live in LA and I don't make enough to buy a house, I don't suspect I'll ever need to get another mortgage. Renting the house would fetch $900 to $1300 a month in the area, depending on how much we want to charge.

Two questions:
1. Is there any good reason to not try to put the house under my name?
2. Is there a better way to ensure the siblings benefit from the sale of the house when they pass? The house wouldn't be sold immediately after they pass. The idea is to rent it out and benefit from the income and sell it a decade or two after our parents pass or whenever the market dictates.

One other random question, since the house is worth 3 times what the mortgage is, can any sort of mortgage magic be done to pay off the mortgage now with what the house has in equity? Or is that not how mortgages work?",finance,1422403123
personalfinance,Paying down student loans versus saving for a house,"Hello,

I’ve got a question about paying down student loan debt versus saving for a house.

My fiancée and I both graduated from law school in May, live in Washington, DC and are 25. She has around $190,000 in a consolidated loan at a 7% interest rate. I have a consolidated loan of $285,000 at a 7% interest rate. My fiancée started work in September for a law firm (big law) and makes $160,000 (plus annual bonus and lockstep raises). I started work at the beginning of this month and make $40,000 a year working at a nonprofit. My fiancée is currently paying back her student loans at $2,500 a month (10 year repayment). I’m on IBR (loan payments capped at 15% of discretionary income, discretionary income being 1.5 * the poverty rate) and my current payments are based on my income as of Jan. 1st so zero as I wasn’t working yet. That will change now that I’ve started working but my loan payment will be covered by my school’s loan repayment program which fully covers your loan payments as long as you work in qualifying employment (government, nonprofit) and making less than $75,000 a year. Furthermore, my remaining loan balance will be discharged after 10 years of qualifying payments (while employed in the government or a nonprofit, paying zero while doing so counts as a qualifying payment, forgiven amount is not taxable income) so I’m not going to end up paying anything on my student loan debt if everything works out.

So that leaves us as a couple making $200,000 a year and having to pay off my fiancée’s student loan. Post taxes and loans (her current $2,500 a month payment) we are left with $84,766 or $7063 a month. Our fixed monthly costs right now are an apartment ($2,550 a month with utilities and internet) phone plan ($175) transportation and commuting ($200) and groceries and household goods ($600). That leaves us with $3538 a month (or $42,456 a year) after our main expenses.

We have a couple other financial considerations: currently have $5,000 on a credit card (0% APR for purchases the first year, we used it to fund our bar trip in August and have just been paying the minimum since, will pay it off in the next couple months); getting married in September and will personally be spending around $15,000 including the honeymoon; my fiancée is applying for clerkships for the 2016 or 2017 term and will have an income of around $50,000 for that year (will be making significantly lower loan payments for that year under IBR), this is mitigated in part by the fact that she’ll receive a bonus (around $30,000) when she returns to her firm and will still advance in class year as if she had been there (so salary and annual bonus will go up).

For a realistic starter home in an area we’d actually want to live in we’re looking around $600,000 - $900,000. We don’t plan on moving again until our kids are school age (say first kid enters kindergarten when we’re 35, so 10 years from now) and at that point we’ll move farther out to somewhere with better schools.

So my question is, does it make more sense to focus now on paying my fiancée’s student loans down faster and continuing to rent or saving up to make a down payment on a house. We have a dog and would really like to get into our own house with a yard. Renting a house is an option and wouldn’t be terribly more expensive than what we’re paying now (probably over $3,000 a month with utilities versus $2,550 now). Currently our biggest considerations are saving up for the wedding and then preparing for our 1 year income drop if she ends up with a clerkship.

If anyone wants to chime in with any other advice for a couple in our situation please do.",finance,1422403401
personalfinance,First credit card from my credit union. Secured credit card. Questions.,"I submitted an application for a secured credit card from my local credit union that I have been a customer of for 4 years, and today after a week or so they responded to my request. I have been denied from all the 'easy to get' cards in the past that I wanted to use to build credit since I have none, and was surprised to get a positive response back to this secured credit card.

The response they provided me was:
&gt; Thank you for your secured credit card request.

&gt;For the secured credit card, we use the funds from your account to secure the credit limit. **What limit would you like for the card?** We will need for this amount to be on deposit with &lt;credit union name&gt;. We place a pledge or hold on the funds. The funds will remain pledged for as long as the credit card is open.

&gt;The interest rate is at 9.25%. This is the prime rate (currently 3.25%) plus a margin of 6.00%.

&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions.


First, I am asking here for a faster response: What would be a reasonable start? $500, $1,000?

How does a secured card actually work? If I have a $500 credit limit, do they actually remove $500 from my account immediately to fund it, or does that mean I just need to maintain $500 in that account at all times? If so, that sounds sort of like a debit card, but regardless I'm a bit confused.

Does that interest rate sound alright for a first card?

In short, I am almost 30. I have zero credit. I can't get loans for things like cars and pay for everything in cash. I've checked my credit score online several times and each time it reports there is insufficient data to provide a report. I just want to use a card to pay for groceries and bills and pay it off each month so I can build some credit.

I'm currently 30 years old, working 40hr/wk @11.00/hr. I have a BA in religion and a masters from seminary. Ordination takes a few years upon completion of masters, and yields a regional average of 62k/yr. Within my denomination and our cooperating ones, each individual church is its own 501c(3), so I’m hoping that I can get my massive student debt forgiven after 10 years, like most NPO’s. 

I’m not here to debate the merits of that arrangement, but it’s the only way I see myself not dying homeless, so I’ll take it. 

Here’s a snapshot of where I’m currently at in terms of budget. 

Student Loans: $44/mo (IBR) to one lender, $44 to another. Over 100k owed on federal @6.8 interest. Back to back forbearances still active on each lender.  $117/mo to a private lender, with about 6k to go, @ 7.2% interest. 

As of today, $300 in checking, $100 in savings (I get paid weekly so I shave $20 or so off each paycheck for savings). 


Delinquency on my federal student loans has trashed my credit score (570).

Living: $450/mo on rent (with a roomie), $189/mo on my car, (for which I needed a cosigner) with about 8800 left to go. 

So total for the bare minimum is each month is $844. I’ve been good about the private loan, car loan, and rent. My federal loans are what are crushing me. 

I have no credit card, only a debit card. The only credit card offers I get now are pre-approved cards @ 22.9% interest I’m too poor to move, but I can’t afford a place on my own and I doubt even a cosigner would get me an apartment around here (Ohio by the by).I am unmarried, I have no children.

personalfinance,Can I afford to move out while I'm student teaching?,"Hi PF, thanks for reading. 

As the title states, I'm wondering if I can afford to move out while I'm student teaching. Before we get into my financial details, I'd like to explain why it's so important for me to move out. 

Neither one of my parents work -- they are at home all the time. My dad quit his job in 2013 because of mental health reasons and my mom has not had an out-of-the-house job since my brothers were born. My brothers (21) and sister (18) also live at home. One brother is in college and the other has autism. 

R1, my brother with autism, is very low-functioning. He does not flush the toilet unless you ask him to. He can't speak a full sentence without prompts. I could go on. The issue is that when he turned 21 (last April) the public schooling system in my state kicked him out. My parents should have had multiple plans in place for what to do with him once he was out of school, but their first plan fell through. 

R1 has been in school, mostly year-round, for the majority of his life. Being cooped up at home with both of my parents and literally nothing to do and nowhere to go was hell for him and for us. And he regressed -- he paced nonstop, he banged his head against the wall, he attacked my sister while she was driving him, he punched the TV and broke it, he has broken all the toilet paper holder things in the house, he's broken mirrors, torn apart shoes, books, etc. He eats constantly and cannot be left unsupervised. 

Fortunately, we now have a sort of a system in place and he is mostly better. However, once last semester I had to wake up at 5:45AM to drive to a school where I was supposed to observe, and at 3:00AM he was banging his head against his bedroom wall, which is also my bedroom wall. I don't know how I can be an effective teacher if my sleep is interrupted like that.

I am not sure I can live like this while I am student teaching. If it isn't R1's behavior, then it's my dad's depression and negativity and anger bringing everyone down. For these and other reasons, I really, really want to move out. 

Sorry, that was a lot to unload, and I could go on, but I just want to make sure the reason why I'm asking is clear before I give my financial details, which are...

*  **5,588 -- unsubsidized loans (interest rates at 4.66 and 6.8%)** 
*  **4,500 -- bank loan (9.1%)**

* **0 credit card debt** 
* **$500 emergency fund**

I will definitely be taking out more loans (hopefully Federal PLUS, as I turn 24 and qualify in May) for summer and fall tuition. I also might need to take out loans for just my current living expenses (cell phone bill for the whole family, repayment on bank loan, auto insurance, gas, etc.) if I cannot save up enough before student teaching starts -- so total, that would be an estimated $7,000 more in loans (high estimate; living expenses at $3500 and tuition at $3500), BEFORE money for rent and food. Is it really a terrible decision? 

I'm estimating rent and food for a semester at $4,500.

Fed rates are at an all time low, and with the US economy doing well, it is unlikely that rates will do anything but climb, albeit slightly.

I have a [pile of stickers, a stack of envelopes, and a roll of stamps](http://i.imgur.com/4ZU0i5g.jpg). I want to offer a handful of doge stickers to you! (will not include any glitter!)

&amp;nbsp;


Post if you want some and I will pm you to get your information, once I'm out I will update this and show the stack of envelopes going out. I reckon I have ~100s of stickers and a handful is around 5-10 so I calculate a lot can be sent out.

I do not want any tips!! If you are feeling generous maybe help by doing any of the following!

* 1) Sign up to [Jet.com](http://savewithjet.com) for early access to a new ecommerce site. Once you get in, **give them feedback saying you want them to accept cryptocurrency/dogecoin**! They may listen because their site is launching soon and wants to compete with Amazon by selling cheaper. One way they are doing this is 1% off your order if you use a debit card instead of a credit card. If they add cryptocurrency/dogecoin, they could offer bigger savings so they may listen. If you are unfamiliar with Jet you can read about it [here](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2015-01-07/amazon-vs-dot-jet-dot-com-marc-lore-aims-to-beat-bezos). They've raised $80m and sold their last site to Amazon after being beaten in a price war.

* 2) Share http://savewithjet.com/ on your facebook or twitter. Anyone who signs up gets early access + 6 months free membership on their site, no requirements or anything. Jet is holding a contest and the people with the most signups get Stock. I'm in the top ~20 and you have to be top 10 to get stock. Its still a long shot for me but I would appreciate any help! 

* 3) Be generous with your stickers, also do not double dip with extra accounts to get sticky!

* 4) Show off your stickers when you get them, and continue spreading Dogecoin!

I was originally thinking of giving out Dogecoin but stickers seem like a fun idea!

Ill update when I'm out of stickers, and I'll update once I'm done with the presentation with Jet Thursday evening to let you know what they think about accepting cryptocurrency/dogecoin.

edit1: Going to sleep, 4 envelopes stamped/stuffed. When I get up will see if there are anymore requests then drop these off at the post office! I have not put a dent in the amount of stickers I have!

The colleges are owned and operated by the university as a residence and college system. It is by no means a cheap enterprise to live on campus (as im sure many can attest) and at the moment i am struggling to make ends meet because i have not been paid.

Work was conducted during the 2nd week in december as formal training for the position (first aid certificates, mental health training etc). This work was in excess of 40 hours during this week. I consequently conducted further work for the university (in conjuction with my role) which totalled around 20 hours. this work was all conducted before the new year. It is now the end of january and i have still not been paid for any of the work conducted in december (by my calculation 60x25=$1500 less tax).

What im trying to acertain are my rights here. Im currently engaged in a second mandetory training period for the position (another 40 hours) and was informed today by the payroll manager in my universities HR department that NONE of the work will be paid until at least the 14th of february.

Now obiously im mad and have jumped up and down but it seems like im butting my head against a very large machine here. I cant engage in other work that will actually pay me on time because i wont satisfy the qualifications required for the positions in question by law.
The real issue stems from the fact that my rent is due (around 480/fortnight) (ultimately to the university but a completely separate division) and i have now been fined $50 for late payment upon missing my direct debit date. Now while i agreed to these conditions as part of my residential contract i kind of dont know what to do as on one hand the university owes me a significant amount of money and on the other i in turn owe them money but it seems they can fine my for not paying them but i have no retaliatory fining that can occur. besides the interest that money would have accrued in my long term savings account (a small number naturally but still money that i should be entitled to).

the excuse given by the hr department for failing to process these payments was that they were understaffed and had not finished processing the new additional employees hired at the end of last year and in the new year (in my division of RAs there is only ~50 of us!)
TLDR: i need my job to support myself, havent been paid from said job and now cant support self as im being fined for not paying my employer the money i owe them because they arnt paying me the money they owe me.

What the fuck do I do, what are my rights under fair work (i have checked the website, revised my employment contract and award (which both do not state anything regarding the period in which remuneration is required to be paid) and have spoken to the employer directly.

I am a recipient of an NIH Early Independence Award for my research on aging and regeneration in the brain, and recently published a paper in the journal Nature Medicine describing the rejuvenating effects of young blood on neuronal and cognitive function in aged animals. 

The Villeda Lab is interested in understanding what drives regenerative and cognitive impairments in the aging brain, and moreover how the effects of aging can be reversed in the old brain. Our lab is focused on three areas. First, we are looking at how immune-related changes in old blood contribute to impairments in neural stem cell function and associated cognitive functions. Second, we are looking at the contribution of the innate immune system to age-related impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Third, we are looking at how exposure to young blood rejuvenates neural stem cell function, synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in the old brain. Ultimately, our goal is to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote brain rejuvenation as a means by which to combat age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction.

personalfinance,Question about interest rates on car loans for a first-time buyer,"How do you make it to 29 without ever having bought a car? My parents gave me my first car at 16, and my second car ever I bought directly from them, so I don't have experience with obtaining an auto loan from a bank. So, I have a few questions.

My husband and I are needing to upgrade from a 2 door to a 4 door vehicle. Baby on the way! We have our eyes on a 2011 Honda Insight. It's $12,000. The dealership has tentatively offered me $4,000 to trade in my 2 door 2007 Accord, but I am in the process of trying to sell it myself to get a little more money.

Either way, let's say this vehicle will cost $8,000. The dealer sent me this email:

&gt; If your credit score is over 740, the best rate I can offer is 2.99 APR. It is a simple interest fixed loan and you can go up to 75 months.

According to CreditKarma, my transunion rating is 746 and my equifax rating is 743. According to my Discover account, my FICO score is 775.

My question is, should I just take this rate or should I ""shop around"" for better rates? I know 2.99 is pretty good--does it get much better? Is it worth a few hard inquiries on my credit to save a few fractions of a percent? Should I seek ""pre-approval"" or actually apply for loans at different banks to see the rates, then possibly turn them down? How do I adult?

A side note--I don't believe this dealer would try to swindle me or anything. My parents have bought all their vehicles from him since forever. They grew up together. Not sure if that matters, but as ignorant as I am in this scenario I'm not doing business with a stranger who would take advantage.

personalfinance,"$200k in student loans, consolidated at 7% interest. Advice?","So I posted a comment in another subreddit about the $17,000 in interest I paid on my student loans in 2014 that garnered a lot of attention, so I'm going to do a full post here and see what you guys have to say about my situation.

I'm 30 and live on the west coast.  I have a law degree from a top 10 law school.  To pay for the school, I took out a considerable amount of debt and it is currently consolidated by the government at $203,000 at 7% interest.  I just got my 1098-E and I paid over $17,000 in interest last year, while barely making a dent on the principal.  Note: my loans accumulated interest for a year or so while I studied for the bar exam and found a decent job.  I pay $1500 a month, probably $1200 of that is interest.

I have a good corporate law job, making approx. $135,000 a year, which should increase annually as my career progresses.  My take home pay is about $3500 every 2 weeks.  My mortgage is $2,000 a month and my car payment is $700 a month at 1.9% interest (certified preowned luxury car -- I wanted something nice for the sake of appearances for my job -- I need to impress clients and so on).  I owe $240,000 on my mortgage and $30,000 on my car.  No credit card debt.  I have various expenses each month like groceries and food, insurance, cable and internet, heat and electricity, clothing, etc.  I like to eat out with friends, which can start to add up.  I'm single and my tax returns are usually decent because of my withholdings (I know, I know, I shouldn't give the government a free loan, but I like the influx of cash every year).  I put 8% of my income away in a 401k, which is at about $20k.  I have 15 grand in savings and 6 grand in checking.

I assume most people will suggest paying more each month on my loans.  I am going to try to do that this year, but as everyone knows, it's tough to pay more than the minimum on your debt.  Does anyone have any experience with moving their government loans to a private lender for a lower interest rate?  Does anyone think I should just keep paying the minimum and hope the government eventually pays off the debt? (note: I work in the private sector, so I am ineligible to have the public service 10 year loan forgiveness program).

My wife and I just purchased our first home.  We are married but file separately.  The mortgage is in my name, I make roughly $60,000 (with an additional $1000-$2000 a year doing freelance).  We have to file separately because she has approximately $150,000 in law school student [federal] loans.  She currently works for the state so she is on IBR, and because state public defenders make very little money, her monthly payments are only $200 (and she receives $2000 a year from her law school).  If we file jointly her payments would jump to around $900.  Anyways, I digress.

I've always done my taxes myself, via an online tool, but this year we paid off my student loans ($5000ish), got married, bought a new construction house, bought new appliances (stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, washer, and dryer), put up a fence, landscaped the exterior, in addition to a few other smaller items that I know affect our taxes.

Dogecoin satoshi value is the same and our USD/ CNY price dropped slightly. Trading volume is down across all the exchanges. This comes after Bitcoin prices peaked at $315 and now we're at a readjustment. 

Price action for Dogecoin has been a flat line today. We're on the cusp of breaking up or down, only time will tell. Our current support is at 58 and we hit resistance at around 63. In order for Dogecoin prices to become more independent from Bitcoin, we need to have more Doge/USD pairings. Most Dogecoin trading is matched against BTC which makes us dependant on Bitcoin prices. If we get more volume in USD trading this pattern will break. Right now to trade effectively in Dogecoin requires being simultaneously aware of Bitcoin and Dogecoin markets. Personally I trade both and have been trading Bitcoin really heavily since the last huge dump. I bought in at $180 during the panic and made some nice profit. Now I'm waiting for the next big move. 

There was a really good idea shared by /u/investorshibe on one of Good Shibe's posts about starting a Dogecoin community trust. This idea really reflects the spirit of Dogecoin and can help provide liquidity to fundraisers and start ups. In order for something like this to happen, the proper legal framework would need to be created. All trustees would need to use their legal names for the documents and we could set up a multi-signature process such as a 3 out of 5 signature model. This would create a legal entity for Dogecoin to act as a vessel on the high seas of commerce. It would also attract lots of media attention because as far as I know, we'd set presidence as the first crypto community to do so (correct me if I'm wrong.) This type of plan would solidify our community and give us more clout. We need a commercial lawyer in our community to draft up the appropriate paper work. It's important to have all our angles covered so the Feds don't shut us down. This idea means graduating to the next level.

personalfinance,"Graduating and getting married in May, how should we approach this coming year?","Hello, I'm a college senior and in May I will be graduating and getting married.  My fiancee will also be graduating in May.  I'm looking for advice on how to financially survive our first year of marriage.  This first year being June 2015 - May 2016.

So here's the details:

Our only current debt is my car loan, which is $14k.  It's a 5 year loan with an interest rate of 0.9%.  I pay $254 a month.  Both our schooling and living expenses have been paid for by our parents.

We've both worked part time throughout college.  She will have $3k saved up by graduation, I will have $10k saved up.  We will use her savings to furnish our apartment and buy anything we need that we didn't get from our wedding registry.  My savings will act as our emergency fund.

Next school year my fiancee will be getting her Masters Degree in education.  We will have to pay her tuition which will be about $15k.

I've estimated our expenses to be about $2k a month, so $24k for the year.  Adding her tuition on top our total expenses will be $39k.

I currently work as a waiter in a restaurant.  Based off my earnings for this past year I estimate my earnings for our first year of marriage to be at least $30k.  This job is my last resort, I'm hoping I can find a better job after I graduate.

Chances are my fiancee will only work during the summer, earning between $3-5K.  There's a possibility that she could get an apprenticeship that would pay for her tuition but we're not sure how likely that is.

She will graduate with her Masters next May and will be able to work after that, so after this year we will have two incomes which will be approximately $60-$80k overall, our expenses will also rise to about $30-35k a year.

We would like to avoid taking out a loan for her tuition as much as possible, but I would also like to not use all of our savings to pay for her tuition.

So I'm looking for advice on how best to approach this coming year for us.  Should we take out a loan for the tuition, or should I dip heavily into our savings?  And is there anything I'm not thinking about that we should plan for?",finance,1422461361

personalfinance,I've analyzed my federal student loan IBR payoff strategy to death and I really need a fresh set of eyes [student loans],"Here's my federal student debt:
$29,274 at 6.625%

I am on the IBR plan. For a long time I was under the impression that if I no longer qualified for economic hardship, for instance by making more money in the future, I would get ""kicked off"" this plan, but apparently that is not the case, which is great but puts me in a conundrum because I can't figure out if there is any benefit to paying more than the income-based monthly payment.

Based on my salary, this plan gives me a monthly payment of $150/mo, approximately $70 less than it would be under a standard repayment plan. But I can afford to pay more, and I've been paying $185 a month just to stay ahead of interest accruing. I currently work in the non-profit field, but ""Better safe than sorry"" is my motto and I know that I may not always get to be picky about taking a job that qualifies me for 10-year loan forgiveness, so I don't want to bank on that. Rather, I'm making decisions assuming that I will get my loan balance discharged after 20 years (as per the terms of IBR repayment). However--and a lot of people don't realize this--the value of any discharged debt gets counted as taxable income, which is where my central conflict comes from. Note: This loan was in forbearance for a very long time, so I've basically only being paying it off for a year. 

SHOULD I:

1) Pay off my loan as rapidly as I can afford to (as I've been doing)? (Frankly, even doing this I may not pay off my loan in 20 years and may end up with some extra taxes associated with it being discharged)

or

2) Pay the minimum payment and just eat the tax bill when it comes in 20 years? 

A key component of this question is the total I would pay in either scenario. Figuring this out requires more math competency than I have, as well as speculation about what the tax rates are going to be in 20 years. The risk-averse part of me says that I should pay now because I can afford to and I don't know if I'll be able to pay a giant tax bill in 20 years. On the other hand, I'd rather be in debt to the IRS than to DOE because the IRS won't charge me any interest. But for all I know, the amount I end up owing in taxes could be more than the original value of the loan.

**TL;DR**: Am I an idiot for paying more than my income-based monthly payment on the IBR repayment plan? An extra $35/month isn't much, but I definitely have other pressing financial needs that it could help with.",finance,1422462983

Let's assume that bankers may issue federal reserve notes (physically) or tokens (virtually) backed by the value of bitcoin. So we will likely have a virtual money backed by digital money. It is plausible, because people nowadays rely mainly on the infrastructure provided by bitcoin payment processors' or wallet providers' (Coinbase) infrastructure and does not verify whether the transaction was verified and processed by the core bitcoin network (off-chain transactions). I bet that a lot of people won't bother visiting blockchain.info or any other block chain explorer just to verify whether their transaction was processed by the core Bitcoin network. It all comes to the ease of use.
Bitcoin technology also saves people (and bankers eventually) a lot of money and resources.
But the growth of digital-currency technology has even more profound implications. It could reduce financial costs overall and leave more money in people’s pockets. At the same time, it could spell job losses—potentially rendering obsolete millions of positions in traditional intermediary services. Which is not a bad thing.
What are your opinions? What are possible scenarios of Bitcoin vs. banking industry?

personalfinance,Form 1099-HC question- I'm a Massachusetts resident under mom's health insurance in CT,"I had insurance all year last year through my mom's employer's insurance. On turbotax it says:

I didn't receive a 1099-HC, and my mom wouldn't have either, because she's not in MA. Do I leave this blank? It's asking for the insurance company, their federal ID number, and my policy number. I'm not sure what their fed ID number would be, I tried googling it.

personalfinance,Pending Inheritance - need solid advice - Canada,"After a recent death in the family, I've discovered I will inherit about $100K.  I've always been a bit of a spender and don't want to squander this money.  

I'm 47, single, and only have about $34K saved in a locked-in RRSP.  I was discharged from bankruptcy about a year ago, so have no debts.  The bankruptcy was due to a failed business, not because of bad spending habits (well, not entirely anyway).  Prior to that, I have never contributed to a TFSA and I have years and years of room in RRSP 
contribution limits.  Likely more than the $100K coming to me.

I have a decent job, earn about $75k annually, but would love to be my own boss again.  Working for someone else sucks, but I'm only two years out of the failed business.  So not entirely sure that would be a smart move.  

My employer has a RRSP matching program, but I won't be eligible for a couple weeks so don't know the details of it yet.

As for property, I previously owned my own condo, but that went in the bankruptcy, so am renting now at $1600/month.  I am a bit gun-shy of owning again as I was saddled with a huge $40k bill when our building envelope failed.  Thankfully, that bill also went in the bankruptcy.

Although I like to spend, I don't have a lot of tolerance for risk when it comes to money.  

I also need a car - and possibly a ""forever"" car.  Would be happy with a very good quality car that will last me 20-25 years without being a pile of junk at the end.  I am thinking that getting a car loan may be a good idea, and give a substantial down payment.  This would allow me to rebuild credit, and hopefully get a decent interest rate on the balance of the loan as I would be considered very high risk.  

So, do I continue working and max out TFSA &amp; RRSP's?  There won't be another chunk of money ever coming my way again.  Or do I look for another small business to run and learn from past mistakes?  I honestly am super unhappy with the work I do, freakin' hate it, but it pays the bills and more.

Looking forward to some advice.",finance,1422464809

personalfinance,PF please help me talk some sense into my SO about this car!,"So I [22F] and my SO [24M] have been together for three years. He is about to buy a new Audi S3 which is $43000 stock with his parents co-signing and I think it is a horrible decision. He thinks that he will be able to get a 4% interest rate because he has better credit than his parents do but I do not think he will get that rate with a low to mid 700s credit score. 



Some background on us: we are both full time college students with part time jobs. He makes about $20000 a year currently with a credit score of around low 700s-mid 700s. He seems to think that he when he graduates he will immediately get a job and bring in upwards of $60-70k, I told him that is not common for a bachelor in business, but he thinks he can do it. To be fair, he might be able to make this as he seems to have a way of getting what he wants out of companies, but most likely it will not. Even if he does bring in that much, that car is still too much.


So basically right now he has a brand new 2015 WRX with under 10k miles on it. It has been having a ton of problems, which I have seen first hand, so I can understand wanting to get rid of it, but I think he should get something of the same value or less. (WRXs are $34k new) Currently his parents make the payments and pay his insurance in full which is fine because they are well off and can afford it no problem. He said the payments on the WRX are about $480 a month which I think is absurd already (and makes me think his parents have poor credit, they are well off but seem to live out of their means a bit). The Audi will probably be at least $50-100 more each month. 


He says he is going to take over the payments once he graduates and gets a job. His insurance is going to be ridiculous on the car as well because its  a sports car. I think he is being completely short sighted and only looking at the short term of this instead of the long term. It is going to be very very difficult to make the payments plus insurance plus rent and everything else. 

Also I don't want to live in a shit hole just so he can have a nice car. We currently live together so this effects me too. If anyone has any advice or can do the math on this to show how expensive its going to be I would really appreciate it, he just does not want to listen to me when I have repeatedly told him this is a bad idea. 


Also, he fails to realize this will in-debt him to his parents for a long time if he cannot immediately make the payments after graduate and I (and I thought he did too) would really really really like to avoid this. His parents are another post entirely so Ill leave that out. 


Any help would be greatly appreciated!!  (Also I am not looking for any relationship advice or anything about how I should leave him now, I would post in r/relationships if I wanted that-I just need other people to write out that this is a horrible idea financially) I will happily provide any other info needed.

personalfinance,Overpaid be federal employer during internship; tax season; accountant said to not worry?,"**Background:**

Interned at a federal agency for 6 weeks. Was originally a volunteer intern position but was able to transition over to paid through an informal conversion to the [Pathways](https://www.usajobs.gov/StudentsAndGrads) paid internship. Was left in the payroll system after leaving position and took a while to get removed. In that interim time, I was paid when not working. Filing as dependent under my mother.

**Numbers:**


Based on my bank statements, my direct deposit pay = $4,113.38. 

Below are the dates of each direct deposit:


* 7/18 = $412.00
* 8/01 = $969.28
* 8/15 = $910.70
* 9/12 = $910.70	
* 9/26 = $910.70

But, there are some irregularities with the leave and earnings statements:

* 7/12 = $0 - I think this is okay because it just establishes direct deposit; doesn’t seem to correspond with direct deposit entry
* 7/26 = $969.28 - okay
* 8/09 = $910.70 - okay
* 8/23 = $0 - my last week was the start of a 2-week earning period, so this should have been half of what I normally earned during a full period, so ~$400.
* 9/06 = $910.70 - overpayment
* 9/20 = $910.70 - overpayment
* 10/04 = $0 - okay? I think this and 11/15 might be when I was getting processed out and this was a final statement
* 11/15 = $0


My W-2 = $5306.40.


**Accountant:**
Have contacted my mother's accountant who with these details and he replied: 
&gt;Attached is your payroll reconciled to the cash received.  I think the last two paychecks, or at least the last one received was a termination check, and the next to the last one, payroll that is a pay period behind.  I would not be concerned about the matter and stop contacting the [federal agency].

Here's the [reconciliation](http://i.imgur.com/XJGuq5p.png). 

**Next steps:**

What I think needs to happen is to (a) receive the debt repayment letter, (b) repay 9/06 and 9/20 debt; correct for 8/23 statement(?), and (c) adjustment of W-2 to reflect accurate wages.

I don't know anything about taxes but the accountant's advice feels wrong to me because I don't think there's any termination pay associated with internships.

personalfinance,Wife about to attend graduate school - loan questions,"Hey everyone,

Here's a quick breakdown. My wife and I got married a little over six months ago. We are both in our early 20s and recently graduated. We just sent in our Matriculation Fee to Northwestern University in Chicago for Physical Therapy school. It's quite expensive and scholarships/grants are very minimal, so we will be paying for most of this journey through loans. It isn't ideal, but it seems to be very common.

As I've found out about the lack of scholarships/grants, I've been trying to think of ways to go about paying for this. I know that with my income (nothing set yet, we will be moving in the next few months), we should be able to take out minimal loans past the tuition/fees.

Is it worth it to take out the maximum loans offered (could be 10-15k more than we need), and then put that into some kind of investing account for the next year. Obviously it doesn't seem intuitive to take out more that we need, so that's why I'm here. The extra money made from investing could go towards paying off her undergraduate loans, paying for grad school, or even paying off the loans from grad school. Theoretically this could allow us to take out less loans at the end of her education and potentially save money in the long term.

I was told that the loans will probably be anywhere from 5.5-7.2% interest. Federal loan rates for 2015-2016 haven't been set yet.

Am I overthinking this? Should we just take out what we need, or does it make sense to look into taking extra out? If so-what type of investing account should I be looking for?

Our public state University offers optional 457(b) retirement accounts. I understand that a big advantage of the 457(b) account is that distributions can be made before age 59.5 without the 10% penalty that other retirement accounts (like 401(k) and 403(b) accounts have) if you separate employment from your employer.

My question is this: If I separate from my employer, then return later, is my 457(b) back to an inaccessible state? Or am I allowed to continue to withdraw the funds from my previous employment stint without penalty?

My wife and I work for an employer that is the largest employer in the area and are thus interested in the consequences of returning to work for them, possibly on a part-time/consulting basis in an early retirement scenario, one where we might need the money from the 457(b) to be able to live on.

Thanks for any guidance!

EDIT: I got in touch with my plan administrator, and they had this to say:

&gt; Thank you for your email.  Once you are no longer working for the plan sponsor, you are eligible to begin receiving penalty free distributions.  All distributions are taxable as ordinary income and federal taxes and any applicable state taxes will be withheld from withdrawals.

Now we find ourselves holding notes with undesirable interest rates (6% and 5.375%) and I think it's time to refinance.  Unfortunately, the LTV ratio based on tax value is not the greatest on either house.  


One house we owe 82,000 on at 6%, have 10 years of no late payments on a conventional mortgage through Chase.  The tax value on the house is 94,500.  It is in rural Minnesota and we were unable to sell it when we tried, due mostly to the fact that the small town is shrinking.  It does provide stable rental income that covers the mortgage and escrow, but no profit.

The other house we have owned for 5 years, we owe 115,000 at 5.375%, no late payments FHA through Chase.  The tax value on the house is 142,000.  Purchase price was 130,000.  (Multiple improvements were done post purchase)  This house makes about $300 a month in profit, when they pay.  (They pay every month, but never on time.)  This house is sellable, but has proven profitable, so we aren't looking to liquidate it.  

Our third house is our primary residence and we aren't looking to refinance it.  We owe 176K on it at 3.5% and it is valued at 220K.  Of course no late payments.


Our credit scores are 803 and 763, with incomes of 76K and 45K respectively and we have a cash reserve of around 30K, but 26K of that is set aside for an international adoption and, while is cash on hand, is not something we are willing to spend on mortgages.

We're all familiar with the payoff amount of a loan, which is usually a bit higher than the principal you have left (once the lender has accounted for interest).  My question is around this.

So, I have a car that I'd like to dump my saving into paying off.  For simplicity's sake, let's say that the remainder of the loan is $10,000 and I have $100 minimum payments, with a payoff amount of $12,000.  

To avoid paying the additional $2000 for payoff, why can't I pay $9,900, then wait for my normal payment to cover the last $100? 

I'm from NJ and I believe it's a NJ law (maybe federal?) that you can't be charged for paying extra principal on a loan.  Will they catch on and I'll have to pay the additional amount anyway, even though it wasn't a full payoff?",finance,1422485240

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt Consolidation - Specific Questions &amp; Is It Too Late To Justify?,"I'm really kicking myself for not doing this 1.5 years ago when I first looked into it.  But I'm in the situation where after school I have been making plenty so my debt-to-income ratio is outstanding, but yet I have huge interest rates from parents, etc back when I took them.

I'll break this down into 2 sections, my federal loans and what is left of my private loans. I'll show my rates and balances below, but first I am looking at SoFi and/or Darien Rowayton Bank (DRB).  They seem to have the best rates and good standing with everyone.  So first any thoughts on either of these two?

Also is the credit check against my credit score something I should worry about, or at this point does it matter minimally?  Because really I see benefits to consolidating both my federal (DRB) and the last of my private (SoFi), but don't want 2 (or 3 if I were to get car, etc) marks against my credit score for the next few years.

**Ok, the numbers**

* **Federal:** 7 Loans with 10 years left totaling $21,370 with rates ranging from 3.15% to 6.55%.
    * **Federal Weighted Rate: 5.02%**. (Quick simple math, likely not technically 100% correct)
* **Private:** 3 Loans left with 2 providers totaling $8,538 with rates ranging from 9.25% to 10.5%. 
    * **Private Weighted Rate: 9.48%**

I've done a lot of math using loan calculators and sparring more details here's what it breaks down to. Not sure which of these makes sense more, or if it's suggested to try and consolidate both separately? 

* Federal: Be safe and get 10-year loan, not sure if variable or fixed is the way to go since it's a longer time-span??  But let's say I get it down to 3.5%, over the full 10 years that could save around $1,866 in interest.
* Private: I put a lot of money in so I'd go for the 5-year variable and safely assume they are paid off within 2.  In that case a rate between 4-6% could save me $600-900 of interest over only the 2 year span.  



**Obviously my numbers aren't exact due to various factors. And I want to still be 'safe' enough in case of emergencies, but I am young and therefore don't mind some risk... If I lost my job I'd likely get another easily at this point in my career.**",finance,1422487784

So next summer I'll be working for 15 weeks at my internship. I'll make $16,800 during that period and will receive free housing that HR told me is taxed. I don't know the value of that free housing, but I assume it's around $700/month. So that extrapolates to an annual pay of $65,440. 

So anyway, $1100/month would be withheld in federal taxes if I calculated that right (neglecting my one deduction lol). When really, it should be about $600/month!

State taxes would follow a similar trend.

personalfinance,Looking to buy a home,"hello R/personal finance

my wife and I both work non oil field related jobs in oil rich Alberta, and if you have been watching the news you know that the price of oil has tanked and thousands of Albertans have lost their jobs.  The listings of homes for sale are swelling nearly every day and we have a decent sized down payment saved up.

We are currently renting a 83 M square appt for 1500$/month +10$ renters content insurance

the prices that are listed for a lot of these propertys are still quite high but I have learned from the real estate agents i have been speaking with (who are all hungry to get me to buy) are convinced that lower offers will be accepted.

As it stands I may just reduce my monthly housing costs by purchasing now.

We have viewed several town houses with basements that are all 100 M Square or larger

If I spend $210,000 (sticker price) on a home at 5% down my mortgage is approx $950 monthly with about $500 budgeted for Utilitys and condo fees and insurance.
But if i can negotiate down to $150,000 i can afford to put 10% down and my morgage payment would be around $610 With the same $500 for other housing expenses.

But the market could possibly totally crash instead of just losing 30% and i could be quite underwater.

also my interest rate of %2.8 is only set for 5 years, then the rates could be much much higher

personalfinance,Tuition Debt - pay or no?,"Apologies if this question has been asked before, I searched but didn't see it - please let me know! Using a throwaway because finances.

I'm trying to help my (21yo) little sister with her student debt. She has federal debt that she's making payments on and also owes about $4.6k in unpaid tuition + interest to a college she attended in California for 1/2 year. (Long story, I wish our educational system taught anything whatsoever about money to young people...)

I'm asking about the unpaid tuition. The debt is about 2 years old, was farmed out to a debt collector for the past year, and just was temporarily reabsorbed by the school.

I called the school and offered to settle for 65% of the debt paid immediately after terms were documented and the college told me several things:

* They will only settle for knocking off a portion of the interest that's accumulated on the debt, and only do that for a limited time before the debt goes out to the next debt collector
* We're accumulating about $60/month in interest
* They will hold this debt and try to collect on it in perpetuity, they do not sell to debt buyers, and they will never settle for a percentage of the principal
* When they farm out to a debt collector, they split the payments 70/30, but the guy I was talking to told me he wouldn't even offer a settlement for 70% to the controller as there's no collector currently involved, because they wouldn't accept it.

At this point, given she has years to build credit in other ways before she would need to buy a house or whathaveyou, 4.6K is a lot of money for me/something the rest of our family can't afford at all (although if she really needed it I could pull it out of my savings and forgo travel dreams to build it back up), and I'd rather we both put our resources toward our futures, I'm wondering if we should pay at all?

The school is holding her transcripts for the 18 credits she accumulated as a freshman, but she could revert to her high school transcript and make up those credits in half a year at community college if she wants to go back to school, start building credit in other ways, and just ignore the college and the insane price tag that came with it.

Would not paying harm her future significantly, or should we make these payments happen?

business,I want to buy the business from my boss.,"I'm 23 and I work in a sandwich shop for a mom and pop. I started at 15 at Subway, then worked my way into management at Potbelly before realizing I'm a lot more about the creativity of making good food over the corporate fast food thing.

I started working with this shop two years ago. Three or so months into my tenure, my boss mentions to me in a moment of confidence that they ""want to sell"" but they're ""under too much water"". The business was not doing well. The menu was too big and outright incomprehensible. We sold out of our best seller on a daily basis while we were throwing out less popular items just as often.

Since learning the recipes, I've taken over almost every aspect of the shop. I order our product and bread. I shrunk the menu and made it easy. We don't sell out, and we no longer carry the non sellers. I started delivering locally. I've staffed the shop with hard workers I've met through my short years and we work wonders. Things are on the up turn, but the owners resist change at every turn, which I don't understand because they have obviously checked out. The lease is up in December and I don't think he wants to renew.

We have excellent food, a great location, and I've finally amassed my dream crew to work behind me. I don't have any money or credit, but I have some investors who know my quality of work and capacity for work and they are ready to back me.

What do I need to know about buying a business? How can I determine what the business is worth? How do I start the conversation with the owners? I'm very uneducated in the matter, and before putting up more of my non-money and going to college I thought I'd ask for your input.

Thank you.



**EDIT:** Thank you all for the advice and support. I had to sequester my phone throughout the workday so as to avoid the temptation of reading each response as it came in. I have decided that I am going to open my own shop, and do things my way from the ground up. 

Perhaps I may purchase some of the couple's equipment if it looks like they are going to shut down toward the end of the year, though I honestly think I could buy better and cheaper elsewhere. I have put out of my mind the idea of purchasing the business and/or any of this man's debt. They have dug themselves a big hole, and I will continue to try to get them out so long as they pay me well, and also for the learning experience. For as well as they have been to me, I work hard for all I give them in return and owe them nothing more.

In the meantime I plan to focus on creating my own business plan, designing my own menu and meeting with both an accountant and a lawyer. Fortunately I have both of those close in the family. I've even just signed up for a workshop on starting a business.

After finding this subreddit, I decided to make an account and create my first post. Hence, be nice to someone new to the game!

Anyway, I am currently 20 years old and I am halfway done with my first year of medical school here in the US. I will graduate in 2018 with approximately $170,000 in Federal Stafford loans at 6.21%. The total loan amount is not yet set in stone, but it is looking to be between $160 and $170k by 2018 when I am finished.

My question to everyone is how should I handle my money immediately after graduation? When I start residency, I am planning that I will make about $50,000 before taxes (the current national average resident salary). Now, I have options for how I can pay back the loans as I'm sure many of you are aware. I could go for the standard 10 year repayment which would result in a monthly payment of about $2,000. This plan is nice just because I hate the idea of being in debt. Or I could go with a plan such as PAYE which would be something like $400 per month for 25 years or so (along with a few other specifics such as any amounts left to be forgiven, etc.). 

I would also like to add that my family does not come from money so I am pretty much on my own through this... With the exception of my wonderful girlfriend of almost 5 years. More than likely we will marry before I am residency and she has a good chance of landing a $50,000 per year or more job in four years as well once she finishes her PhD. The reason I bring her up is should I structure my payment plans aggressively, spending basically most of what I earn in a month to cover loan payments in order to get out of debt fast? 

Lastly, the biggest wrench is not simply how to pay for my loans, but how to manage paying back the Feds versus putting money away for retirement? As a physician I can expect probably $200,000 or more per year once I am done with residency, but that could be anywhere from 4 to 8 years after I graduate medical school depending on what field I choose.

Sure, I have time to figure this stuff out but I want to have a solid plan laid out so I am able to spend money by the time I am 40 on luxuries I will have earned by then (nice car, vacation, house, etc.).

Credit Score: Taking the median of all 3 bureaus, it should be around 750.
Cash in checking: $200k 

All my CCs get paid in full, on time always. I am self employed, and after my accountant finished filing for 2014, due to the prior years depreciation/losses that carried over, I hardly had any net profit to show for 2014. I made around 100k net profit, but the losses in the prior year cancelled out almost all of it.   

I have a pretty lucrative business where I expect lots of returns in the near to immediate future, especially with the pending receivables that are due (over $400k within the next 3-4 months). 

My concern is that I don't want the lenders to assume because my tax returns show losses, that: 

1. I should pay a ""higher"" interest rate
2. I should put more money as a down payment

etc.

My mortgage is up in July. The current lowest rate I can find is:
2.15% variable, 5 year term, 20% prepayment.

Should I pay down my mortgage as fast as possible by making payments of $2,000 on the mortgage? That would get my mortgage paid off in 6 years (I understand the variable rate will most likely change, but for simplicity lets assume it does not.)

Option (B):
Or should I stretch out the amortization period of the loan to say 12 years and make mortgage payments of $1,050. That leaves an extra $950 every two weeks to invest.

That works out to $24,700 that could be invested throughout the year. I would hold the stocks until retirement, I am 33 years old so it is a while away.

The problem is, I was away on a business trip for the middle two weeks of January, and didn't get the letter until today.  I've now been delinquent on my student loans for 24 days without my knowledge.

I immediately sent an online payment as soon as I read the letter, and tried to re-set up the auto debit, but I'm worried about my credit score.  Is there any way I can get these 3+ weeks of delinquency scrubbed from my record?  Or am I SOL?",finance,1422542289

This ""Liquid Asset Poverty Calculator"" tells you how much you'd need in savings to weather a financial crisis (e.g., job loss, medical emergency) based on the size of your household. It also tells you the percentage of people in any city in the US who don't have enough in savings to weather a storm.

I decided that instead of getting close to 10k refunds from the IRS (the 3.5k of federal tax I pay plus all the credits.) I would use the withholding calculator at the IRS website and follow it's advice. Now my question is that now I'll probably only pay 300 dollars in federal tax (because I changed my witholding a little late this year I was trying to avoid paying any tax) am I still elgible for all those credits that would typically net me 6k more than I paid in taxes.

personalfinance,[UK] Recently came into £5k. Have debts of £8k. What to pay off first?,"Hi,

I recently came into £5,000. I have debts of £8,200 and no savings, but around £1k in my current account.

£2,700 of that is on a credit card of which £2,000 is interest free for another 12 months. The remainder has an interest rate of 20%. I'm paying £100-£200 a month into this at the moment.

I also have a personal loan of £5,000 which has an interest rate of 9% (So at the moment I owe them £5,450). I'm paying this off in £250 monthly instalments at the moment.

The first thing I will be doing is paying off the £700 at 20% on the credit card. I'm looking for guidance on what to do with the rest of the money. Do I:

1. Pay off the credit card in full, and put the remaining £2.3k into the loan, continuing to pay the remainder off the loan on a monthly basis.
2. Pay off the credit card in full, and save the remaining money, continuing to pay off the whole loan on a monthly basis.
2. Pay off the loan in full, and continue paying the credit card off on a monthly basis.

I took the 12month deferment so I could get caught up on some other bills and go back to paying on my loans sometime in 2015. 

Do I need to report the payments/interest from these student loans? Does getting them out of default do anything for me tax wise? What about the interest I am deferring until this year, will I owe that on my taxes, or just owe it when I start paying on my loans again?

personalfinance,Strategy for getting out of CC debt,"So I have just gotten (back) into budgeting and watching my finances closely. With  help from folks that I asked around, I have come to the realization that I may have to reduce my credit card debt load. Here's my current picture:

  
Assets   
Primary House Value : 360,000  
Rental House Value : 170,000  
Investments - stocks &amp; Bonds in 401-K: 174,000  
CDs + Cash: 60,000  
Total: 764,000  

  
Liabilities  
Primary Mortgage: 275,000 @ 3.125%  
Rental Mortgage: 115,000 @ 3.625%  
Credit Cards: 43,000 @ 0%    
Student Loans: 19,500 @ 6.8%  
Auto Loan: 20,500 @ 3.24%  
Total: 473,000  
  

Immediate Goal: Eliminate CC debt.

  
All my CC debt is @ 0% APR and my credit utilization ratio is right at 15%. I pay 655/mo in just minimum payments towards this debt.


  
Option - 1:



After all my monthly expenses (including CC minimum payments) are paid, I have about $1415/mo left over. Applying this amount towards the debt, I can pay off the debt in a little over 30 months this way. I am reasonably confident that I can continue getting 0% APRs to cycle through during this time.

Option 1 summary: Do nothing. Pay off debt in 2 and half years.



  
Option - 2:

Refinance my primary home to a 30 year fixed.

Current morgage @ 15 yr: 2450/mo (PITI).
30 year offer right now: 1780/mo (PITI) &lt;-- Loan balance remains same, term 30 years, $500 cash to closing. Interest goes up to just above 4.1%

Save 670/mo. I can now apply 2085/mo towards the debt

Option 2 summary: Refi to 30 yr. Pay off debt in 1 yr 8 months.



  
Option - 3:

Transfer credit card balances to HELOC right away. Eliminiate 36K balance. Payoff 7K using cash. The 

The HELOC has a 10 year draw period. The interest paid is tax deductible. The interest rate is just above prime. (effectively, i.e after taking tax into account) I will pay about 3% in today's interest rate climate. 
Monthly interest only payment is 140. Monthly cash available for debt paydown is 1930. Debt cleared in 18 month (since 7k paid off right away).

Option 3 summary: Pay down 7k Cash, Use 36K HELOC. Eliminate debt in 1yr 6 mo.


  
Option - 4
Use current cash reserves to pay off all balances right now. The downside is that I always viewed my cash in CDs as a form of emergency fund. This is gone, and will take 1 yr and 9 mo to replenish.

Option 4 summary: Pay cash 43k. Be debt free immediately.

personalfinance,IRA Asset Allocation at 39,"Hello everyone. I got fed up with the mutual fund where my Roth IRA was located. I transferred it, in entirety, to a brokerage account in order to manage it myself. I am working on picking an asset allocation for my age bracket but I feel as though the amount I've been able to save isn't very robust for my age group so I may tolerate some more risk in order to catch up. My hope is that my desk job lets me work beyond 65 years of age so that I don't have to draw on retirement until approximately 70. 

After scanning the forums it seems there area a few options:

1. Put it into a ""target"" fund for ~2040 or whenever I think I will officially retire

2. Do another mutual fund (I hate this because I feel like my returns are eaten up by higher management fees)

3. Manage a portfolio of ETFs and other investments while balancing regularly. 


I like option 3 because there's more effort on my end but more of the returns are my own as opposed to being eaten up by management fees. 

What asset allocations work well for a more aggressive retirement portfolio of a 39 year old? I used the Liftoff [https://liftoff.advplatform.com/] tool and it recommended:

35% - VIG - Vanguard Dividend Appreciation

13% - IJH - iShares S&amp;P Midcap 400

25% - VEA - Vanguard Developed Markets

15% - VWO - Vanguard Emerging Markets 

12% - RWR - REIT ETF

I have no doubt that we will be married one day, but in the mean time, I feel like we are working in opposite directions since I'm trying to accrue wealth and she's trying to pay debt. I want to help her with her loans, but she is very opposed to that. We are about to make the move to a big city and I'm struggling trying to figure out a few things. 

1.) Since I'm debt free, I'm struggling to figure exactly out how much to put away between retirement savings, non-retirement savings and monthly play money. I'm not sure if there is such a thing as putting too much away towards retirement, but I feel like $1,000 a month is a lot. Even with this, I am free to do most of the things I like to do, but it doesn't leave a lot to put towards non-retirement savings, in the event I want to buy something big, like furnish a bedroom or a new car in the future. 

2.) We're not married and even though we keep our finances completely separate, I still feel like we are one unit and I see her debt as my debts. Is this the wrong way of thinking of it until we get married? 

3.) Since we are moving, I feel like this is a very opportune time to buy a home on a 15yr fixed loan, especially with interest rates as low as they are, I qualified for 2.75%. Should I buy or should I keep accruing wealth? Or again, should we be tackling her student loans?

UPDATE: 

1.) I am looking to buy a home around $160K. I've worked the numbers and even after putting the same amount towards my retirement fund and all my expenses for the month (to include entertainment money) I still have a few hundred dollar in discretionary spending, this is the money I would put into savings. Also, none of this is factoring any money that my girlfriend will be contributing. I wanted to be sure that I could afford it in the worst case scenario that things go south. 

2.) I would be purchasing the home solely in my name. 

3.) As a military member I qualify for a VA loan which requires 0% down and no PMI.

4.) I hear time and time again that unless I will be in the same spot for a while I shouldn't buy a home. But I have a plan, one that has been executed by a friend of mine also in the military. Every few years the military moves him and ever time he buys a new house and rents out the old house, he now has 5 houses all managed by rental property agents. He seems to be making it for him, but this is contrary to many posts that I see, what am I missing?",finance,1422558018

I received a letter from FedEx today that states that I owe them 103.02$ and that they will send a collections agency after me If I don't pay the amount in full. 

Now, the problem is, I paid this bill back in September and I verified it by looking up my bank statement.

personalfinance,Hypothetical Questions that I'd like answered (lotto),"So I was reading about the Cash4Life game and have a few questions I'd like answered out of curiosity. 

Let's say a 16 year old asks his mom to buy him a lotto ticket, it's a Cash 4 Life game.

The mom is 52, smokes, overweight, high blood pressure. However the 16 year old is very healthy.

The game rules say anyone over 18 can claim the jackpot ($1,000 a day) or second place ($1,000 a week) for life. Anyone under 18 maxes out at 20 years.

Would it make more sense for the 16 year old to claim either but only for 20 years or for the mother to claim it?

Now, let's say you win the $1,000 a day for life. That's 365,000 before taxes per year. Adjusted to federal and state tax I calculated it would be around 261,340 a year after a 28.4% tax. In 20 years that's $5,226,800.

Is it better to take this money and put it all away, or take a percentage of it for spending, or combine some of it with some of the money you'd earn while having a job (might as well work if you're young).

personalfinance,Owe 10% for moving Rollover IRA to new institution on taxes (USA),"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm living abroad at the moment and while I went back home this summer my parents said ""Move both your Rollover IRAs to Schwab (my bank)!  You need everything in one place!  You have money all over the place! *nag*nag*nag*"".  So, thinking my dad is pretty well-informed (which he typically is) on the matter, I logged into my eTrade account and transferred my Rollover IRA from there to Schwab no problem since eTrade has everything online.  Then I drove over to my credit union, did some other financial business there, and the branch manager said she can cut a check for the Rollover IRA amount I had there so I could take it over to Schwab (my hometown has a Schwab bank/branch) since I was going anyways, went over to Schwab with the paper check, and deposited it into my Schwab Rollover IRA.  I later logged into Schwab and allocated all the funds.  All fine and dandy.


Now, my mom scans me over a 1099-R my credit union mailed (no documents so far from eTrade), introducted this forms information in my 2014 Federal filing, and it shows now I owe 10% on the credit union Rollover amount.  I went form owing/receiving $0.00 to Federal owing $363.  I thought since I moved it within 60 days from one Rollover IRA to another Rollover IRA there wouldn't be any tax implications.

personalfinance,Emergency Fund vs Student Loans,"Hello,

Recently I've paid off my car and what I have left in debt is roughly $14k in student loans over 10 yrs (~$4.5k@3.15%, $4.5k@4.25%, $1.5k@5%, and $3.7k@5.35%). All of these student loans are federal loans, so they have the benefit of deferment. In addition, they are all considered subsidized, so I don't believe interest is charged if I ever had to exercise the option to go into deferment. I'm 24 and make about 60k/yr gross.

I've calculated a rough estimate of my 6 month emergency spend, and it equates to about 12k. I am also only contributing to my company's match of 5% in my 401k. My question is given the benefit of deferment, should I build up that 6 month emergency fund, proceed to pay off the remainder of the student loans, and then look to increase my 401k contribution to about 18%? Or should I forgo amassing that 6 month emergency fund and just aggressively pay down the student loans first?",finance,1422565289

personalfinance,Claiming 0 plus withholding extra to avoid owing federal taxes?,"Hi everyone,

I just calculated our taxes for 2014. Married, filing jointly, just over $50k AGI combined, we OWE just over $1000. This is the first year I've ever owed the IRS.

January of 2014, I quit my job and began working where my husband works. Previous years, if we had filed separately every year he worked there, he would always owe money, but since the amount I was refunded was higher, we always received some sort of refund if filing jointly.

Now I'm working there, and we both owe.

I checked out the IRS's W-4 calculator so we can avoid owing next tax season. The results were that not only do we both need to claim 0, we also both need to withhold an extra ~$15 each paycheck for each of us! Unfortunately, I can't remember what each of us is claiming right now. My guess is 1 for myself, 0 for my husband (we tried changing it to avoid him owing but he still owes).

So, what'd I'd like to know is: is it normal to have to claim 0 AND withhold extra each check to avoid owing federal taxes? We are a married couple, we both work 1 job, no children, and we file a very basic return (standard deductions, not homeowners, etc.).

Oh, and I qualified for the short coverage gap for health insurance when I changed jobs/insurance. We do not owe anything since we are both covered, so this isn't a factor (just in case anyone thought I overlooked this). (edit: I included this info in regards to my shock in owing on federal, not because I think it factors in W-4 withholdings.)

investing,Mortgage for rental vs REITs on margin,"How ridiculous of an idea is it to invest in real estate using ""other people's money"" through buying REITs on margin? 

Interest rates for mortgages look to be about half that of margin loans for similar principal amounts. 

For a rental property: property insurance, property tax, property management fees, repair and upkeep costs as well as vacancies would eat into the return of the rental property.

For a REIT: management fees (low), and a higher interest rate on borrowed money are what's working against you. I'll assume 2% dividend for a REIT per quarter with a 7%APR margin loan, the dividends per quarter should be enough to pay for the loan payments.

I will try to provide as much info. as I can. I'm in Canada and my current mortgage holder is CIBC. I don't mind CIBC and am happy to stay with them, but would also be willing to switch. 


The balance of my mortgage as of today is 93,577.54

Mortgage interest rate: 4.63%

Maturity date: June 21st, 2015 

Maturity amount: $92,313.61

Remaining Amortization: 19 years 4 months


My house was just appraised by CIBC a year ago at $185,000 and by a real estate agent for $215,000+.  At that time I took out a Home equity line of credit to do some necessary home repairs/renovations. It was a foreclosure home when I bought it, so work was extensive.  


Home equity line of credit $46,000

Interest rate: prime + 1% (was 4% now 3.85%)


I also have credit card debt from being sick for almost two years, but it is all at 0% interest and will be paid off by the end of this year, or more likely by September. 

I would like to get a 4 year mortgage because there is a very good a chance I will be selling my house almost exactly four years from now. I also prefer fixed, because variable makes me a little nervous, but maybe I am just being silly

So here is my question I have received an early mortgage renewal rate of 2.94% which I immediately called them about and asked for their best deal, they will get back to me in 48 hours.  What I am thinking about doing is consolidating my mortgage and equity loan with the new interest rate, for the same amortization period.  I realize this will incur some legal costs and fees for a new appraisal etc...however it means that instead of throwing money at the equity loan as fast as possible I can take one year to save an emergency fund (which I depleted while sick) and also start saving more aggressively for a new (used) car which I will need in the next two years.

After the initial year my goal would be to throw all my extra income into retirement investments which would hopefully gain me more then what I would be losing by taking longer to pay off my mortgage. 

I'm just not sure if this is my best move.  Maybe I should throw all my money at the equity loan and kill it faster? I also have a annual payment option on my mortgage of up to 10,000 if I choose, so in theory I could also increase my yearly amount paid off and still concentrate of retirement investments.

I'm expecting a tax refund of around 3k-4k this year. The way I see it there's three things I could do with the money:

1. Pay off a sizable chunk of my student loans. I'm sitting at around 11k right now, details below.

2. Complete my emergency fund. I have about 2k in it right now, so putting the return money here would mean I could probably forget about it for the time being. Again, details on my budget below.

3. Put it into my Roth IRA, which I just opened a month ago. It has 1k in it now, so I could max out my 2014 contribution with this money.

My student loan info is as follows:

Loan #1, 
$5,524 Balance
3.4% Interest Rate

Loan #2,
$3,686 Balance
3.86% Interest Rate

Loan #3,
$1,600 Balance
5% Interest Rate

My budget is as follows:
Income: ~$2500 a month after tax, health insurance, and pension contribution
~$475 in rent
~$80 in utilities
~$220 in car expenses (insurance, gas)
~$13 in renter's insurance
~$200 in groceries (includes food and any other incidental household things)

So, a decent amount of wiggle room in my budget. Not to mention in 6 months my current salary (40k a year) is getting bumped up to 48k, and 6 months after that again to 52k. I'm not terribly worried about an emergency where I lose my job, but I understand it's still important to keep an emergency fund. On the other hand, being debt free ASAP sounds quite nice.

Unless I'm told otherwise here, I probably won't do the Roth IRA one. I can still contribute a good amount to it before April 15 out of my paychecks and I'd like to get myself settled in the short term more right now.

personalfinance,Trying to pull myself out of the hole. Need some sound advice.,"Hello Reddit, 
My sister recommended this forum as one that is insightful as well as extremely helpful in a number of topics.  This is my first post so..be kind.  I am considering bankruptcy.  I have a couple of issues.  I can say that at one point, I had paid off every last debt I had so that I could buy a home.  I purchased my home from a Nonprofit agency.  I closed on the home in Oct of 2006.  My first payment was due in December of 2006 and it turns out that the Mortgage company paid off an exorbitant property tax bill from the year before in November of 2006 so before I even made my first payment, my equity was in the negative to the tune of 2800 +.  I didn't find out about this however until November of 2007.  Here I thought I was doing such a good job with my payments each month, paying on time and all and all of a sudden I get a notice of a ""readjustment"" of my payment.  Because the Equity balance had gone so far negative, the mortgage company was proposing a new monthly payment amount of a little over $1600.00!  My initial payment was $547.54.  I was completely stunned.  This was an amount that I had no way of being able to pay.  Then I was offered what was described as a ""federal home assistance refinance"".  The loan was ""sold"" to another lender and the balance was refinanced and I was given a new payment of $820.46.  I wasn't happy, but It was better than the $1600.00.  I made this payment for several years I have to admit to being late sometimes but it never went 30 days late. The loan was then sold again to another loan company.  and I continued to pay with them.  About 3 years ago, I was advise that I had an overage that allowed for another readjustment which lowered my payment down to $657.14.  Around the same time, I was looking at buying a car/van.  Over the years, my credit was once again slammed. (I allowed a ""friend"" to get an apartment in my name and lets just say vaseline would not have helped at all with the way she handled things).  in addition, I got sucked into the payday loan nightmare.  So when it came time to purchase a car, my credit sucked. my only option (or so I thought at the time) was buying a van with a 23% interest rate.  I paid this van off and traded it in (like a dummy with the same company) thinking I would get a lower interest rate but....nope just got a newer van (2006) with the same high rate.  Right after, I had to take off work for a while and had two back to back surgeries.  I did receive the company disability payments but it was no where near what I normally take home.  This threw me into a spiral.  I continued to pay on time for the car payments as it is set for auto pay.  I fell behind on the mortgage payments.  I didn't help that due to an electrical problem and such a huge house, my monthly utility in the winter ran anywhere from $900 to $1300 and from $600 to $800 in the summer.  The water was approximately $300 monthly.  So all this to say that at this point, I have moved out of the house (about a month and a half ago) and it is pending foreclosure.  I am still working my job and I actually make a fairly decent amount but being sucked into the black financial hole, I am always broke and literally living pay check to pay check trying to get caught up.  i am now wanting to get rid of this truck I have because I found out yesterday that I am horribly upside down on it.  I owe approximately $12000 and the KBB puts the value at about $4000.  I don't know if I should try giving the van back, or what.  I moved into an apartment which I expect my utilities will go down significantly.  The rent is less as well.  I have a dealer who says that he can get me into a lower interest vehicle with a lower monthly payment with a down payment of $2000.  He is also recommending that in my case, letting the van go back after getting the new car may be in my best interest.  Since I am already in a pending foreclosure, and my intent is to file the bankruptcy, can someone tell me if it is in my best interest to let the van go back and add to the bankruptcy?  I would appreciate any advice. I know that I have made a mess of things and I want to try and do things smarter.",finance,1422586870

I have a little less than 40k in student debt, broken down as follows:  

8k @ 3.4%  
7.6k @ 3.9%  
7.6k @ 4.7%  
11k @ 5%  
2300 @ 6.8%  

Considering how low some of the interest is, I was wondering if there is any downside to signing up for the graduated repayment plan to minimize my monthly payments, and then tackling the loans in descending order of interest rates.    

Secondly, I was wondering at what point it becomes better to put money into retirement (IRA/401(k)), or investment vehicle like an ETF than contributing to debt.  Seems to me like even if I'm getting a lower-than-historical-average return of like 6% before taxes, I'm still making off better investing money than paying back extra money on a loan @ 3.4%.

personalfinance,"401k, Divorce and my Disabled Mom","Hello, this question is on behalf of my mother who specifically asked me to ""Ask my friends on the internet what they think""... here it goes.

My mother and father were divorced. The divorce decree states that my father's 401k is to be split when it is pulled. The language is pretty simple. 

My father is having financial troubles after being let go of his job last year and decided to pull said 401k. He is 64 and has never broken the 60k per year mark prior to his job loss. For sake of argument though let's assume my father is taxed at 25%. He lives in Virginia and the max state tax is 5.75%.

My mom, of course, welcomed the unexpected extra income as she is disabled and lives off of her Social Security (about 800 per month) in a small apartment which she shares with a friend. She normally pays no taxes. She lives in Illinois where the max tax rate is 9%. 

He called my mom and let her know that he was pulling the 401k and explained to her that the value of the 401k was ~27,000 and that she was entitled to half ""after taxes."" 

Ok. All seems (about) right.

Today, my father cut my mother a check for ""half"" in the amount of ~7000.

My mom came to me stating the amount doesn't seem right. 

Looking up info on 401ks I've deduced the following:

1) there is no 10% penalty for early withdraw after the age of 59.5

2) the payment is considered income and is subject to federal and state taxation

No matter how I math this, the amount he gave her made no sense.

My father has a history of stealing and concealing money - a major factor in my parent's divorce. He even stole money from me in my late teens and twenties before I left home! We've since made amends and I'd like to not think my father isn't up to his old crap again... but no matter how I slice this, it doesn't add up. 

If half after taxes was 7000 - we can assume that 2x that was the pay out after taxes or 14k. This payout makes it appear my father was taxed at 48%...

so... does this seem right? or did I miss something?

TLDR; Mom was entitled to half of father's 401k worth 27k before taxes, was cut a check for $7k - or ""half"" after taxes.",finance,1422596545

Banking,Global Remittance Market Report: 2014 Edition,"Remittance is defined as transfer of money by a person who resides in a foreign country to his or her home country. Remittance industry contributes to economic growth and livelihoods of people across the world. In most of the developing countries, money sent by foreign migrants to their home countries constitutes the second largest financial inflow to the respective nations.

Furthermore, in the money receiving countries, remittance industry promotes further economic dependence on the global economy instead of building sustainable local economies. Remittance channel is collectively comprised of a sender, a recipient, intermediaries in both countries and the payment interface used by the intermediaries. The remittance system encompasses the following components: Remittance Service Providers (RSP), Remittance Corridors, Remittance Network and, Money Transfer System. Remittance Services are divided primarily on the basis of ways a network of access points is created and linked. There are broadly four categories: unilateral services, franchised services, negotiated services, and open services.

The key factors driving growth of the global remittance industry include rising employed and urban population, ameliorating global economic development, and unceasingly climbing migrant population. Some of the noteworthy developments of this industry include unstable remittance cost, the impact of remittance on health, education and poverty, wide portfolio of remittance services and correlation between remittance and foreign exchange rates. Also, the number of electronic payment service providers that offer over-the-counter-payments, mobile money payment and payment cards have increased rapidly. However, the growth of remittance industry is hindered by the difficulty in establishment of access points, tax regulations and strict regulatory compliances along with the lack of transparency and understanding.

This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the global remittance market, along with an in-depth study of top remittance receiving and contributing countries. The report also includes detailed description of regional markets. The competition in the respective market is highly diversified and fragmented. Some of the major players are Western Union Company, MoneyGram International Inc (MGI) and Euronet Worldwide Inc, among others. The competitive landscape of the global remittance markets, along with the company profiles of the leading players are also discussed in detail.

By combining SPSS Inc.’s data integration and analysis capabilities with our relevant findings, we have predicted the future growth of the industry. We employed various significant variables that have an impact on this industry and created regression models with SPSS Base to determine the future direction of the industry. Before deploying the regression model, the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and the dependent variable was analyzed using standard SPSS output, including charts, tables and tests.

personalfinance,"-SERIOUS- I got my student loans written off, but now that its tax time...","I had my student loans written off last year ($64,000 and around $5,000 interest). I had to go in and out of school several times due to my condition. Being a private school (Not-For-Profit) didn't help matters either.

I received my 1099-C form in the mail a few days ago. I entered in the corresponding information into the tax software, and it comes up that I owe around $11,500 Federal and $4,500 state.

I made around $13,000 last year.

I have virtually no assets. I don't own a car (I sold it to pay off previous medical bills/insurance). I now have Medicaid though. Seriously my computer is the most expensive thing I have @ $500, and maybe a little more worth in clothes.... And yes I will be moving in with a family member to get out rent-free :/

-----
So how do I go about paying this off?
-

One of the first stipulations of getting these loans written off is making sure that you don't make any money. I cannot exceed the Federal set income poverty line for a family of 2 for 2015. Approx. $15,000.

The only 3 ways I know are: 1. Payment Plan. 2. Garnishment on wages. 3. Bankruptcy. The first two are pretty much the same thing in my situation. I am going to be paying it back no-matter what, and probably as soon as possible. Bankruptcy is something that I don't know a whole lot about, and I am not sure would be good in my situation for such a small amount of debt.

Don't get me wrong. I am very grateful for everyone that helped me get my student loans forgiven. Family, friends, doctors, Department of Social Security, and The Dept. of Education. I know this will likely end up being a year or two of hell paying this back to the IRS. This debt is still pocket change compared to the original student loans that I had. **I just didn't feel like I made close to $82K last year.... 

---
TL;DR: **Total and Permanent Disability Discharge has forgiven my student loan debt, and turned it into personal taxable income.** What are the steps to taking care of this when you don't even make that much in a year?
----

* **BIG EDIT: One of the things I forgot to mention is that I had submitted my tax return before I had received the 1099-C form in the mail  :( . And they have accepted/given me the refund I was ""expecting in the first place"", considering I made less than $14,000 last year.** 

I didn't go bat-shit crazy because I lost my refund. I went that way because I went $15K into the red. Thanks for all of your responses and advice for further reading. Really boys and girls I genuinely value each and every one of your submissions. And will be going through all of them tomorrow (Saturday) I would gold gild everyone's response, but I really can't afford it right meow.

______
**I guess I have one more question. Since I got that tax refund when according to the IRS says that I shouldn't, should I just keep the cash in a savings account until they want it back?** Of course my taxes will be *amended eventually*

Bitcoin,I was going to review Bitcoins canada but MAN JUST TRIED ANYCOIN DIRECT,"Dear Bitcoin friends and lovers today I tried the service by Anycoin direct where I was able to instantly get my measley $10 transferred into my btc wallet virtually immediately.

WHAT HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE IF YOU LIVE IN CANADA AND YOUR ONLINE SERVICES ARE LIMITED TO BITCOINCANADA and that other larger financial service provider.

Well this is how.

His name was BRAM a customer service representative who is available to assist you on the website once you've registered. Seeing as I recently had an unenthusiastic self interested first time experience with a seasoned company like bitcoincanada I will try my best to talk about my personal experience. 

My perspective will be fickle. 

It will be harsh.

 It will even talk in nonsensical terms that will infuriate fedora wearing kneckbeards everywhere. 

But I'm the average 3rd wave adopter. The kind that begins to cement the technology as a mainstay for future consumption needs. In fact in Canada I have been behind several bitcoin stories in free papers because as someone who is involved in financial services I've been inclined to see this succeed. But still I'm tepid and pragmatic. I have most of my assets in things like equities rather than slick technologies like LRAD or bitcoin.

So basically I did this. I signed up to anycoin and got my free $5 from them as Canadians are getting $5 for signing up (they say the first 25 get it but I don't believe them because their offer started days ago and I waited for my pay check to transfer to my test bank account. The one that I keep for things like this.)
Then I noticed this little customer service option on the bottom right and was provided an opportunity to harrass the help. But instead they took control of the situation right away by just bantering with me. They noticed that I was for real and had already initiated my transaction for a paltry $10.50. We talked about marketing opportunities. I derided facebook and promoted mediums like tumblr which have a clientele that actually has money's and is at least demonstrating thoughtful updating rather than aimless observations which are even more benign than those seen on twitter. I also suggested promoting on instagram. I don't know how . But anyway...

He was polite and attentive and pretty much inside of 20 minutes I had already curiously provided all my identification required for verification. The final process was so cool. He called via their cam service and looked at my passport to ensure I submitted the right copy. These guys could be selling my identity to members of nihilist movement ISIL right now and I don't care because once that was completed my bitcoin wallet beeped with my deposit and then was advised that my deposits will now be (virtually) immediate. this was the most coolest thing ever.
I've turned into a 14 year old girl with enthusiasm. 

Mainly its this process that is missing in the cyrpto currency world. Yes the fee in Canada for a transaction is around 0.29 cents. That's kind of pricey but its SOOOO MUCH better than the first time experience I had with bitcoin canada.
Customer service matters. Empathy matters. The consumer is dumb. I totally dumb. I order things off of Alibaba express like digital print frida khalo sweaters or glitch arty crew neck shirts with a buzzed cat on them. Its like ordinary young urban professional in the financial industry woman this is me. I like dumb cool things and I want the financial service to understand me. The dutch seem to understand me. Thats where Anycoin direct is from.

Bitcoin Canada when I used them allowed a spread of $100 when I made a $50 purchase. Of course there are terms and conditions and I completely understand their desire to protect the potential losses but seriously it was an obscene and fruitless guidance even before when I tried to communicate through non conventional means. They wanted the telephone. Not twitter although they seemed to try reluctantly and they tried on reddit to explain that there are terms and conditions which is true. But man in spite of still being able to complete my transaction and throwing some money at Ramin Nazer a comedian who was on Craig Ferguson in 2012 by buying his books with bitcoin and being satisfied with my karmic deed I also disliked the experience that I got from the typical caucasian canadian man who has become complacent with the fact that in Canada the options for online servicing is few and far between.

I was totally blown away with the candour and respect and patience that I received from the good people at Any coin direct that I have even encouraged my younger prettier girlfriend to try this service out. (ill get another few bitcoins for a referral.)

The point is this I don't work for Anycoin Direct. I'm a net promoter for them. Thats marketing jargon that all major Canadian financial institutions use today (except bank of montreal but they haven't figured out why they have been losing customers yet so maybe they will use this soon).
Net promoting is that it's proven that when a client who is dealing in finances fails in achieving their need if they feel that the institution was inept at providing sufficient education and empathy that they will lose customers and encourage others not to use brand names.
You see it happen all the time.
Sony makes shitty products
Apple is for old people (doesn't hurt them just jealous poors)
CIBC wont give you a second loan (if you're ever late with them on a payment they wont forgive you. ever)
GM KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR (they technically did)
BitcoinsCanada is slow
It all matters even if it isn't true or if it is a mis representation of the fact. All I'm going to do going forward is say hey buddy try this out. If you take the time to verify its going to be worth having immediate bitcoins in your wallet.
That's how I feel about Anydirect coin.

Please don't be offended by this semantic laden anecdote. I've been up all night. But man do I feel good that I was able to try that service out without a hitch because it gives me hope that companies like bitcoin Canada will flounder as brokerages and marketplaces start taking chances in regions outside of the U.S and Europe. Oh sure bitcoinscanada might still always be around and never burn to the ground like I hope they do and the owner might live until they finally suffer a coronary from too many amphetamines and professionally reputable  sex workers but there will I always be me to encourage young and pretty urban professionals with illicit and legit needs to use or try the anydirect service.

Thank you reddit bitcoin for your patience.

personalfinance,Opinions about auto loan (details in post),"Hey PF. Long, long time lurker. Never posted here before, but I've gained so much knowledge from just reading and learning. Now, I've got my own question(s), and would love to hear from different perspectives what I should do. Here' goes.

To start off, I'm 24. College graduate, with $0 in college debt, which I am incredibly thankful of because of my father. I like to think that I'm financially responsible and educated because of my father, who's the same way because of his father. Although I live &amp; grew up in a very middle-class lifestyle in Queens, NY my father was able to put me through a state college due to smart investments and financial responsibility which carried through to me. I've watched him purchase new cars, but nothing crazy. We've owned low-optioned toyotas my entire life. **To preface this, I, unlike my father am very into cars. It's an important hobby to me. It's something that I am okay spending some money on, as driving is more of a relaxant and enjoyment than a burden to me.**

I bought my first car, a '00 Eclipse when I was 18, in College, under my father's name, as anything within NYC is a nightmare for me. It was a cheap car (3k), and lasted me a year. I then purchased a used, $14k Mazda3, which was a dream come true. Again, purchased in my father's name and insurance, so that I could more than afford the car in college. 

Fast forward to last February. I was living at my at-the-time girlfriend's parents house in Westchester, NY, and commuting to Greenwich, CT. A winter storm hit, and I ended up losing control and causing some front-end damage to my Mazda. The car was getting into the upper mileage, and the clutch was starting to go as well. It should have been totaled, but the insurance company decided to repair it, rendering it, in my mind, not the same (and it wasn't).

I had recently got a promotion at work, and decided ""screw it, I'm going to buy myself a new car. I'm commuting 25 miles a day, so I'll get something I can afford and enjoy"". I ended up with a 2013 (leftover as the 2014's were out) Ford Focus ST. I'm a HUGE gearhead, so this was a great choice for me. Insurance somehow stayed the same (~80 a month). I, without my father,negotiated the price down to 23600, with rebates and all, which came to a total of ~26000 with taxes, fees, etc. I'm thankful that he had ME do the negotiating, and let me figure this out myself. It was a great learning experience. I'd done a ton of research and knew exactly what I wanted, what the going rate for it was, and what a fair price was for this car. This worked great, as I wasn't paying rent, and was working a side bartending job as well, so I had a very solid positive income.

Having a decent amount (~15k) in my emergency fund, I put 5k of my own money down, plus the 6000 I was able to sell the mazda for, leaving me with around a ~15k auto loan, in my father's name. With this I was able to get a 2.6% interest rate, which ain't too shabby, with his apparently great credit. We could have gotten a 0% rate, but I'd of lost one of the incentives, so the 2.6% actually ends up being cheaper in the long run, with that incentive. I did NOT finance through FoMoCo, but instead through my father's bank.

**Here's where my questions begin**:
My job gave me another promotion, moving back down to Queens, NY and commuting to/ from the city. I was taking public transit (because trying to park in lower Manhattan is a joke during the week). I was living with my parents for a couple months, and decided it was time to get out, and moved to another part of Queens. I've got two roomates, and pay under 1k rent, which is perfect for me. For a year or two, I kept a fairly tight budget, but have let myself go WAY off that budget the past couple months (girlfriend broke up, blah blah I wanted to have a good time). I'll be picking YNAB back up, and will be re-starting my budgeting as I'm realizing my savings is taking a hit. Moving wasn't cheap, and I just got back from a long-planned vacation to visit some friends, but now that I'm back can start being a bit more frugal.

The company is giving me yet ANOTHER promotion, but I will be traveling around the NYC area as a representative (not commission based or anything of the sort.) So i'll be driving a lot, putting mileage on my still new, still under warranty vehicle. They are reimbursing mileage, but it still doesn't change the fact that my low-mileage new car is going to start accumulating quickly.

At this time, I'm beginning to wonder if I should just pay the rest of the loan off, to eliminate that ~270/mo payment, or continue it. I've got about 12k in a savings (emerg fund), 2k in checking. I have stocks worth totaling somewhere around 25k, and am contributing 8% a month to my 401k, of which my company matches 4%, so it's not like I'm NOT saving money. I was considering selling the car for something cheaper, but am leaning away due to depreciation. (brand new car mistake...). 

In addition, for FUN, and to reduce wear and tear on my still new car, I'm looking into getting a lower end motorcycle. this would also benefit me in parking around where I live in Astoria, as parking a bike there is MUCH easier than a car. It would also take some of the wear and tear off my Focus for commuting. I would leave my car at my family's house in Bayside, where it can sit either on the street, driveway or garage for an unlimited amount of time and I don't have to worry about parking laws. I could more than afford to purchase the bike outright, and already have the license. insurance is minimal. Bike would be around 4-5k, insurance ~200 a year. I know in theory, this is not a good decision. It's dangerous, but it's something I can accept. I can afford it, and it's something I've wanted for some time is the bottom line. 

**My father says to not bother paying the loan off, since it's a small interest rate, but the problem is it doesn't benefit me one bit, as the loan isn't in my name at all. I don't gain any credit from it. My credit isn't bad It's in the upper 700's, but I don't have a lot. I've got 3 credit cards that I pay the full balance off monthly. No student loans to speak of either, and the car loan, as I've stated ISN'T in my name.**


Sorry for the long story/ post, and I did lose track of it a little, but:

technology,Great LED Lights Use For Automotive Headlights,"At the back? Makes you infinitely grateful to be living in these electric times - or for the birth of men like Thomas Edison, come to think of it.

Imagine the perils of driving at night in the 1800s - always worrying that your car might catch fire because of the open flame of your headlamp, or that said light might be snuffed out by a wayward gust of wind or splash of water.

I mean, can you imagine - an open flame in your car? Might as well slap on a couple of bumper stickers saying ""ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN"" or ""BEGGING FOR IT."" And all for a piece of tech that could only nominally light your way. Thank heavens there was no traffic those days. Say it with me: conflagration.

So, given those Flintstone days of automobile history, we are certainly spoiled little brats for choice. It's true that we creatures of the road rarely think about headlamps unless they're busted, or some idiot is bearing down on us on the opposite lane with his beams on high.

Take HID or high-intensity discharge (also known as xenon) headlamps. The pristine bluish-white beams can be irritating or sublime depending on which side you're viewing it from. For nerdspeak watchers, automotive website ridelust.com describes HIDs as ""metal halide arc lights which use two tungsten electrodes to arc a power electric charge. This charge interacts with the gases inside and vaporizes metal salts present in the bulb, producing a plasma that emits a very intense light.""

Dizzy yet? What is very important to note is that ""contamination like dirt or dead bugs on the lens can cause a great deal of glare to be directed up and towards other motorists."" This means that owners of said HIDs need to be responsible for them or risk seeing more motorists flip them off.

Given all the high-tech effectiveness of the HIDs, a new kid on the block is threatening to take over.

In high school, part of the curriculum in our school asked us to make electronic projects that entailed soldering components onto printed circuit boards that we made ourselves by ""etching"" the boards in ferric chloride. Quite a few of those assemblies involved small muti-colored nubs of light that, we were told, were called LEDs, or light-emitting diodes. Not only did these LEDs come in a variety of colors; they also didn't heat up like traditional incandescent lamps.

From those heady days of juvenile creation, you might say the LED dragon has properly entered the automotive scene.

While credit for the first use of the [LED](http://www.sheerled.co.uk) on wide production-use headlamps belongs to Lexus (on its LS600 in 2008), Audi (locally distributed by PGA Cars) is widely regarded as the voracious, avid user of the innovation on its models. It is now a brand seen as a vanguard in LED headlamp technology.

PGA Cars public relations officer and motorsports manager Menchie Ramirez maintains that LEDs are highly superior to usual halogens because ""it is energy efficient - presently four times so. By 2018, we expect it to be eight times more efficient. It also has an indefinite service life and reacts up to 10 times more quickly than traditional incandescent bulbs.""

More than that, Ramirez says that LED bulbs are environment-friendly because they do not contain mercury.

Aesthetically speaking, ""The advent of the LED also opened tremendous creative possibilities for interior and exterior lighting design due to its size and material. Bundling several LEDs allows construction of modules, known as LED arrays. These are extremely flat, compact, and require less space than conventional light sources. It allows designers to realize complex lighting functions in tightest spaces such as cornering lights, for example.""

Ramirez also points out that LEDs are a lot better than HIDs because ""they are easier on the eye as they do away with bright high beams that can be distracting.""

Another advantage of the LED is that (as mentioned) they do not produce too much heat - owing to a lighting process does not require heating up an element. A couple of the challenges though are, according to ridelust.com: the need for sinks for the heat that comes from the back of the lamp, and the temperature sensitivity of the LEDs, which means they deliver ""different light levels at different ambient temperatures.""

Audi, however, ""recognizes the potential of the LED technology. We utilize it in such a way that it gives our models their distinct look and character. A number of light emitting diodes can be combined to create distinct shapes that can characterize a particular model. For example, on the A4 and A5, the look is determined, elegant and dynamic. For the Q5 and Q7, the lights appear broad and powerful. In the R8, the lights give a â€˜charging bull' character bursting with vigor and pride. All models are now recognizable at a glance. Also, it opens possibilities for interior and exterior design where it can easily be incorporated into areas that need more flexibility thereby allowing more freedom for design concepts. This gives us an edge over our competitors,"" narrates Ramirez.

Even Kia is, well, seeing the light. The new 2011 Sportage SUV that will be unveiled to the Philippine market soon features daylight running LED headlamps. ""They are an additional safety feature of the vehicle,"" says Boying Soriano, Kia Philippines marketing services manager.

Soriano continues that Kia expects to have more models using LED technology. ""They provide an extra measure of safety while driving your vehicle in all driving conditions. Just like seatbelts, which were optional 20 years ago, I see LED daylight running headlamps to be a mandatory safety feature for all cars in the near future.""

As with other new technologies, automotive LED lights presently don't come cheap, but there is good reason to believe they're going to be on the headlamp assemblies (and most everywhere else) of more vehicles to come across more automobile brands in the very, very near future.

personalfinance,PMI not deductible on state return?,"I have $17k of deductions on my federal return which includes $1k of private mortgage insurance (PMI) premiums. When I get to the itemized deduction section in TaxACT for my state (Georgia) return, it states the following:  
  
""At the time this Georgia module was released Georgia did not follow any of the changes included in the federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The Act included extending the itemized deduction of state and local sales tax and qualified mortgage insurance premiums.""  

And it has an entry for ""State and local sales tax and qualified mortgage insurance premiums"" where my PMI deduction amount has been automatically entered. This results in a $1k reduction in my deduction amount on my state return.

I went with them because my dad was military and with USAA, and before I joined I got on with them through him. Then Navy federal when I was in boot camp.

I'm not really smart with finances, meaning I don't know much about them. I pay my bills, I pay those cards (treat them like debit cards). I have a mortgage and 10k savings right now. I have good credit.

This year I am planning on an expensive trip to Europe to see my family, to take me and my SO there. She can't afford it at all, and I'm paying for her tickets because I love her, and it will be her  holiday/anniversary/birthday present/everything else under the sun present.

I was starting to contemplate one of the 0% APR cards I see get mentioned. As I understand it, the catch is if you don't pay it off before whatever the time frame is, they'll hit you with all the back interest. I figure I could start a new line of credit (which would be nice since I only have two) pay it off slowly, and if I don't manage to pay it off all before the time frame is out, then I can dip into my savings to cover it.

Is this a viable idea? If so, can anyone recommend me a good card to use? Bonus for no overseas charges and maybe rewards? I don't want to dip into my savings for the whole shebang, but I'm not sure if this would be a good idea.

Check the “Married” box on your Form W-4

I need some help deciding how to best bolster my financial situation using the extra $400 a month. Here are some of my ideas:

* HSA Account. My deductible is $3,000 and my wife's deductible is $3,000, yet we only save $1,170 a year in our HSA. Our average medical expenses land somewhere in the $750 range, and we currently have about $350 in the account (I had surgery in October that took it down significantly). I could increase our HSA contributions by $140+ per month to ensure that one or both of us could hit our deductible. This has the added benefit of having some tax implications, but those tax savings are comparable to my highest credit card interest rate. 

* Emergency Fund. I will definitely be adding to this, the question is, how much? We save about $5k a year, mostly through my wife's earnings and have more than six months of essential expenses saved up, thanks to my wife's compulsive saving. 

* Dental/Vision Insurance. Neither of our employers offers this, we have looked into it, but havent decided if it is a good value. Alternatively we could just contribute more to the HSA account to be used towards these things. 

* Retirement savings. I contribute 7.5% of my annual income through an employer sponsored retirement program, and have since I was 18. I might need to increase this a little, but it hasnt been a large concern. 

* Debt repayment. Of course. I have about $10k of high interest debt that I want to be rid of.

Had a few questions...,"So I started my current job in June of 2013, after 2 years of unemployment/freelance work. In total for that year, I worked 6 months at job, and made far less than in 2014. My federal return totaled a little over $1700.

Now, filing for 2014, after working a full year, my return is coming in at a littler over $1400.  I'm confused, as I made far more money, and thus paid far more in taxes.

Is there something I'm missing here?  The only real difference is my income. Am I filing incorrectly perhaps?

I quit my job early January to pursue something else. I will be technically a student again because I will be taking classes to try and get into this new field. 


Anyways, I worked for a bank, and I put some money away into a Roth IRA. 


Current Vested Account Balance Excluding Rollover: $6,282.00

Current Rollover Balance: $0

Life-Time to Date Roth Contributions: $5,311

I am not 59.5 years of age or older :)


The mail I received in regards to my retirement account says ""you are not required to take a distribution at this time. Even if you defer your distribution until a later date, benefit payments from your account must begin by April 1st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you attain age 70 1/2.""


So, I'm not in urgent need of these funds. I have enough money saved up for living costs and costs for school. I would like to keep my Roth IRA and funds the same. I am aware of a 20% federal income tax and a 10% Federal excise tax.

My wife and I made a combined 165k this year, feels like a lot less since we live in one of the most expensive cities in the US.

After firing up TurboTax it says we now owe over 7k in Federal Taxes and $1500 in State.  How can this be?  I did the math and the 45k taken out in taxes is 27%, but the max tax bracket we should be in is at 28% and the majority should be taxed at 25%.



EDIT:  Looks like the turbotax calculations are pretty close, I will need to check to make sure the personal exemptions are being added.

finance,This Week In Credit Card News: Making Your Debit Card Safer; Data Breaches Were Avoidable,"**More Than 90% of Data Breaches Could Have Been Avoided**



Nine out of 10 data breaches that occurred in the first half of last year could have been avoided. A new report analyzed more than 1,000 breaches that involved personally identifiable information. It found that 40% of breaches stemmed from external intrusions; 29% were caused by employees; 18% stemmed from lost or stolen devices or documents; 11% were the result of social engineering. 



**How to Make Your Debit Card Safer**



Although debit cards remain our most preferred payment method, their popularity continues to shrink, likely due to the fraud and risk concerns of consumers. In 2014, 43% of consumers said they preferred to buy with debit cards, compared with 49% the previous year, and an overwhelming majority in the past decade. Meanwhile, consumers preferring credit cards held steady at 35% both years and now include those 65 and older by a 2-to-1 margin. Credit cards may offer more protections beyond the risk of fraud, and there are certain scenarios where you should never use debit cards. But debit cards help you avoid debt and possible interest charges. Here are ways to make them safer. 



**The Need for a National Data Breach Notification Law**



Currently, 47 states have their own data breach notification laws. So if a company doing business in multiple states faces a large [breach of personal information](http://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2015/01/23/this-week-in-credit-card-news-making-your-debit-card-safer-data-breaches-were-avoidable/), that company will immediately be obligated to identify and comply with a patchwork of state laws. These laws may impose different requirements on when and under what circumstances notification is required, and on the method and the content of the notification. In some states, failure to follow these specifications can result in fines, penalties or lawsuits. The result: at a time when immediate response and remediation is critical, these organizations and their counsel must first ascertain and negotiate compliance with any and all state laws that may be applicable to that specific breach. 



**Amazon Abandons Digital Payments, Leaving Fight to Apple, Google**



Amazon said that it is killing its mobile wallet. Amazon Wallet let consumers store gift cards and loyalty cards on their phone to use for in-store and online purchase. But unlike digital wallets from Apple and Google, Amazon’s application didn’t store credit or debit cards. 



**Supreme Court Rejects Retailers’ Bid to Lower Debit Card Fees**



The Supreme Court handed banks a victory when it declined to consider a challenge by retailers to Federal Reserve regulations setting fees for processing debit card transactions. The high court’s action removes uncertainty for the banking industry by ending a three-year federal court battle over fees associated with tens of billions of debit card transactions annually.



**Mobile Payments Quickly Changing the Transaction Industry**



Mobile payments are no longer just a trendy way to make a payment. They are quickly becoming the major force in the transaction industry. Mobile payment volume in the United States is projected to increase at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 172%. By 2019, mobile payments will make up nearly 15% of the total payment volume in the United States, accounting for $818 billion in transactions. Apple Pay and its early success is a significant part of this growth. But another factor is the use of mobile payments by the underbanked. Unbanked and underbanked spenders have easily adapted to mobile payments because they allow for fast transaction processing and easy financial management. 



**MasterCard Announces a Credit Card Even A Security Fanatic Can Love**



If there was a ever credit card that could ease your anxiety about credit card fraud, the new MasterCard (MC) “Hidden,” coming to market later this year, would be it. Hidden is a computer masquerading as a fully functional payment card that works everywhere via swipe, tap, or online entry. The card features several layers of protection you won’t find on your run-of-the-mill credit card, including a light that indicates when the card is “on” and usable. 



**Apple Pay Helps Security, But it’s Not Foolproof**



With the introduction of Apple Pay, mobile wallet payment systems promise to disrupt long stagnant payment card industry. But will these new services make our data and transactions safer? On paper, Apple Pay greatly improves data and transaction security, but it’s not foolproof. As usual, hackers are not standing still. A researcher in Germany recently demonstrated how to replicate fingerprints with a high-quality photo of a user’s fingers, which could presumably be used to gain access to anything protected by biometric data. 



**Is Google Set to Acquire Mobile Payments Service Softcard?**



Google may be in talks to acquire Softcard, a mobile-payments service, in a bid to boost its Wallet and compete against Apple Pay. Softcard, formerly known as Isis, was started jointly by AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile USA in 2010. The company claims that it can be used at over 200,000 merchants, including McDonalds and Subway. Softcard allows consumers to make payments through connected debit and credit cards from American Express, Chase, Wells Fargo and others banks. Reports indicate Google recently entered exclusive discussions with Softcard by offering to buy the service for at least $50 million. 



**LowCards.com Weekly Credit Card Rate Report**



Based on the 1,000+ cards in the LowCards.com Complete Credit Card Index, the average advertised APR for credit cards is 14.41%, slightly lower than last week’s average of 14.44%. Six months ago, the average was 14.49%. One year ago, the average was 14.46%.

personalfinance,"Deferred, subsidized loan… while making regular payments?","Question: Is the subsidized interest of a deferred student loan linked to the non-payment of the loan? Or can a borrower of a subsidized student loan continue to pay as previously agreed and effective turn it into a 0% loan until the payoff of the loan (or end of deferment) without the loaner kicking the interest rate back up?

I'm asking more out of curiosity since this doesn't *directly* pertain to me, but here's a bit of context: I went to college for two years, racked up some student debt, and then decided to enlist in the U.S. Air Force. I knew I could defer my loan (Stafford, subsidized, 5% interest* ) for active duty military service, but opted not to, figuring that it would be better to be paying on it while I had a secure, steady income. Now that I only have a bit over a year left on my military contract, I'm giving all of my finances a thorough look-over, with much help from /r/personalfinance archives, to get it together before I separate and go back to school, and it has led me to many ""should have done that years ago!"" epiphanies. Now I'm wondering if I could have saved money in interest by simply filling out this deferment paperwork.

At this point, I'm essentially avalanche-paying a moderate amount of debt before becoming a civilian again—because giving a steady income to a not-stupid but not-entirely-financially-put-together 22-year-old-at-the-time can have that effect. This loan is on the bottom of the stack, initially because of its 5% interest rate, and especially when I realized that I can reduce both interest and payments to 0 until separating and, if I *had* to although I don't want to, after finishing college. Hence, I'm putting it into deferment and actually not paying on it until the higher-interest stuff is gone. But I still wonder if I could have been a lot smarter about this loan in the first place.

Also, if active duty military can effectively get 0% interest rates on federal loans through deferment, why does the [Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008](http://statesidelegal.org/servicemember-s-guide-student-loan-interest-rates) clause that caps federal student loans for active duty military at 6% exist?

personalfinance,The situation for a lot of us underpaid recent grads with loans and high cost of living... let's break it down!,"Hey everyone, I love coming here and reading the discussions, PF is a great community, and I want to ask my first questions! Please don’t feel compelled to answer every point, I’d def appreciate any input on any of the below conversation starters.

I just finished school and got a job out in a profession (architecture) that doesn't pay as well as you might think, in a city SF that is probably more expensive than you imagine it to be. I’m working pretty hard to learn how money works in a few different arenas (household budgeting, student loan repayment, credit card churning, investing, etc) and would love some advice on where to focus my energy in the months and years ahead.

The Highlights:

I make 48,000 / year at a company I have worked for for 5 months. I haven’t had a review or received a raise, but I’m confident they are happy with my work.

Take home pay is roughly $2,800 / month

The budget breaks down to this:

$925 - Rent

$50 - Utilities/Internet

$600 - Student Loan Payment (more on this in a second)

$70 - Gym Membership

$300 - Food

$300 - Going out (Concert, drinks occasionally, a one day ski pass)

$200 - Clothes, Home Improvement, personal care

$100 - 401k
__________
$2545

Leaving roughly $300 for savings :/

GOALS

Now this is where I’m looking for advice on how to PRIORITIZE.

1   I have $50,000 in Student Loan debt @ 6.8% interest. I want to get rid of this debt, and since I’m in the “Stop screwing students with high tuition and interest rates” camp, I would like to pay as little in interest to the government as possible. I’m looking to consolidate this debt with a bank, get a lower interest rate and pay back in 5 - 10 years. If I could get a 3% rate, would it be perfectly fine to take time paying them back? Maybe over 10 years of minimum payments? Right now the payment is $600/month.

2    I want to Save money every month and build an emergency fund of $4,000 ($600 in it already) What to do with this money though? I’ve been doing one thing (see point 5)

3    Since HS I have paid for just about everything with a credit card, and paid the balance off every month. My credit score has been great as a result, and it’s allowed me to churn Credit Cards. I have 15 (most issued in the past 5 months) and tons of points saved. I’d really like to continue this travel savings for personal-leave trip in a few years… I gotta see more stuff. I can’t not see some stuff, especially after having already seen enough stuff to know the stuff is cool to see.

4     I want to save for retirement. Everyone has said that contributing early in your 20s is the best thing you can do. I see posts on here with 22 year olds making 100k a year investing and putting half away for retirement, and I’m like, well I could have done that too if I wanted…. but I didn’t. So how do I start?! I don’t make enough to “have it all” but I have started contributing $100/ month to my 401k. I don’t even know how my company matches contributions, I think that it is based on our principals’ discretion. I am certainly open to putting more in once I have set up my emergency savings.

5      And now the sketchiest thing I’m doing: I don’t keep much in checking or savings… I have a brokerage account that gives FREE trades, and I’ve put my savings in it. I don’t really know what I’m doing, but I do alright with it. Its a risk, but my reasoning is pretty simple: I’m not likely going to lose a significant amount of it, and even if I did, I’m not likely going to be in a position where that money is going to make or break me. The job is going well, I’m healthy and have great health insurance, I don’t have a kid, I only ride bicycles so I’m not worried about auto break downs costing me a ton… Can anyone give me some advice on this point, either tell me its a really bad idea, or if in my position its fine to do, or give me alternative ways to maintain this “savings”?

Do we file our partnership return (1065) and schedule Ks together as one and do any taxes come out of my partner and mine 1040's? I cant seem to find much info about this. We made $1253 profit together, and each share 50% of the partnership, so our halves round up to $627 each.

I hope that question makes sense, if not I can try to reword it. It's early and I haven't entirely woken up yet. I've done my own taxes before, but the business is a new addition this year and I want to make sure I'm doing everything right. I can't afford the stress of an audit lol.",finance,1422705624

personalfinance,Finally have the opportunity to refinance my private student loans (65K) - do I choose variable or fixed interest rate?,"Good morning PF-



I graduated a university in 2013 with somewhere over $105,000 in student loans (combined federal and private).  At the moment, I am at about $99,500 combined (5 figures... woohoo?).  The first year or so of repayment was extremely difficult because I was still working my barely-above-minimum wage college job.  I made my payments but was 30 days late on a payment once and my credit got hit.  In addition, I had poor financial skills and was basically wandering aimlessly through life, etc etc.  Then I finally landed my first professional, full-time salaried job and this March will mark my 1 year anniversary with this company.  The pay is very much entry-level, but I enjoy my job, am being promoted/trained for a new position at the moment, and see career development possibilities with this company.  I opened a 401K, have full health benefits, and started paying everything I could in full, on time.  CreditKarma and various credit score forums became my go-to for financial advice.  My credit score started recovering and I am now hovering a few points below a 700.  I started adding to my savings account, and though it's still very small and nowhere near where it needs to be, I made it my goal for 2015 to make it into a 6+ month emergency fund.  I know I have a long way to go from where I want to be, but I'm starting to finally get my arms around my situation.



However, the one thing that has been holding me back, like many students and graduates, is my large student loan debt.  I hold around $64K in private student loan debt and $35K in federal student loan debt.  I FINALLY found a great bank with good interest rates that I am in the process of refinancing my private loans with (along with a cosigner)-currently submitting final paperwork and am accepted pending a credit check, which I should pass as I have fair/good credit and my cosigner has excellent credit.  I am not going to touch my federal loans, as they have great repayment terms, good interest rates, and I am using the Income-Based Repayment Plan (IBR).



So I have $64K worth of private loans that I am currently paying $619/month for, at interest rates from 7.05%-8.75%, fixed.  The bank I am refinancing with has fixed interest rate and variable interest rate plans... and it is SO tempting to go for the variable interest rate plan, as they go as low as about 2.6% if you are refinancing for 20 years, with excellent credit, etc.  But the high end of the variable rate plan is over 8 percent... On one hand, I would love to cut down my monthly payment very drastically, on the other hand... it would be nice to know my exact monthly payment, every month, for the next x amount of years (fixed rate plan).  PF, I have no idea what the right path is!  I have included other details below in case they might help:



* **Private loan debt:** $64,000    
* **Current private loan monthly payment:** $619    
* **Private loan percentage rates:** 7.05%-8.75%    
* **Current federal loan debt:** $35,000    
* **Current federal loan monthly payment:** $0 (will be $187 starting March)    
* **Gross Annual Salary:** $42,000    
* **Rent:** None - living at home    
* **Car:** $244/mo    
* **Ins.:** $89/mo    
* **Cellphone:** $90/mo    
* **Gas:** ~$130/mo    
* **Credit card debt:** $1500 - bough a new laptop with 18-month interest free rewards card 1 month ago, will have it paid in the next couple of months    
* **Tax Return:** Expecting approx. $4,000 in tax return, which I intend to use on my student loan debt, then wipe out any credit card debt, then add to my savings/emergency fund.      
* **New** Private loan interest rates: 4.74% fixed 15yr, 5.24% fixed 20yr, 2.32% variable 15yr, 2.57% variable 20yr (Note: these are not final percentages as I have not been given the final percentages, but these are the ballpark percentages offered to those with excellent credit, an account open with the bank, and automatic payments enabled, all of which I am applying with).",finance,1422722677

personalfinance,Mid 20’s Married Couple with 105k combined salary and 60k debt – Should We Rent or Own?,"Hey personal finance gurus!

I have been a long time reader, but I’m a newcomer to posting. I always love the feedback that r/personalfinance has given to many people and I would like any input in the situation that my wife and I are in.

Both of us are in our mid 20’s, recently graduated, recently married and both have a decent low 700 credit scores. My wife has been working for right around a year now and I will be stepping into my first big-boy job next week. We have been trying to save up but it’s been hard since we have basically did our own wedding last year. In about a month or two, my wife and I are planning on moving from our safe haven (comfort of our parent’s house) into our own place. 

Both of us are recent graduates, have school loans, credit card payments, and bills. We’re located in Chicago area and thinking of either owning or renting a home. I wanted to go over the budget to see what Reddit would advise us. For the sake of keeping the numbers simple, I rounded them off slightly. 

.::Income::.
======================================================

Combined Annual Salary: $105,000

Combined Annual Taxes (Fed/SocSec/Med/IL):  -$18,000

Combined Annual Health/Dental Insurance (PPO High Plan 500 ded): -$5,000

Combined Annual 401K (6%): -$5,000 

Gross Annual Income (After Tax/401K/Medical/Dental): $77,000

==Total Gross Monthly Income: ~$6,400
                                                     

.::School Loans/CC Payments::.
======================================================

Combined Student Loans (Gov Sub/Unsub Ranging from 3.8-6.8%): ~$50,000 

- Currently Monthly Payment: ~$700/mo 

Combined Credit Card Debt (4 total): ~$8,500 

- Currently Monthly Payment: ~300/mo (emphasis on higher interest cc)

==Total: ~$1,000/mo


.::Other Payments::.
======================================================

Cell Phone: ~$120/mo (two lines)

Auto Insurance: ~$150/mo (I have a bad driving history)

Gas: ~$200/mo ($25 full tank for each car weekly)

Food: $650/mo (We eat organic, and we try and shop cheaper by not going to whole foods)

Fun/Outing: $200/mo

Gym: $40/mo

Pet: $40/mo

==Total: ~$1,400/mo

.::Potential Own/Rent Home::.
======================================================

Rent/Mortgage: ~$1,000

Utilities (gas/water/electricity/internet): ~$500

==Total: ~$1,500/mo

 
We would have ~$2,500/mo left over every month. Are plan is to use $1,500 to pay off our CC’s first since those are highest interest, and save $1,000 as an emergency fund. After about 6 months, we should have paid off our CC’s and we’ll move towards school payments right after using the same methodology. 
The question here is should we be renting during this time or mortgage? (Continuing to live in parents home is not an option due to agreements we’ve made). We feel that renting is basically flushing down $12,000/year where it could be used towards paying anything off a mortgage and those interest rates. I know there are always things that can go wrong when owning (new furnace, plumping, electrical, etc). We could rent it out after two/three years down the road too.

We got roughly $6,000 and will have saved an additional $8,000 in two months giving us $13,000 to use towards a down payment, mortgage insurance, lawyer fees, etc… once the time comes. I know there are many first time home buyer programs that we can also use for down payment. I need some input from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has any insight on the best thing to do.  Who would you advise us to do; rent or mortgage, and why?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1422729082
personalfinance,"(CAN) Mother is in debt, my father wants me to go on the title of the house so he can get a loan for her","I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible however my parents have a long twisted history with mortgages.

At the moment I am married currently employed at a start-up making $45k and my husband is unemployed as he is going for his citizenship. We have roughly $20k in savings and no debt (I paid off my schooling immediately), but we have already booked a trip overseas for March so I'm assuming it will eat up $5k of that.

We are currently living with my mom and two siblings, and pay half the utilities, all the gas we and my mom use (she never fills the tank), and groceries for ourselves and some for the house. My siblings contribute nothing which is why I have been hesitant in the past to give my mother rent money. When we took up half the utilities my siblings were supposed to take up the other half and then simply didn't.

My parents technically have 4 houses between them. When they were married they had 3 here in Ontario, which was partially bought with mortgages from my father's three siblings who were all independently wealthy. My parents ended up splitting over money (my mother didn't like my father paying interest to his siblings as she really likes to spend). My dad took 2 of the houses and my mom took the one we live in, and got a payout for half of one of the houses even though she did not contribute to paying off my father's siblings and makes more money than my dad. Unfortunately my dad has historically been too nice to people to the point they take advantage of him.

Case in point: My father leases the newer of the two homes profitably. The older home he rented out each floor (3 total) as a separate apartment and made some money, some because the neighbourhood is awful and many tenants were late or did not pay at all. He made the poor decision of selling the home to one of these perennially late renters in some convoluted deal against my advice. The renter got a first mortgage from someone else which went directly to my dad and then he has a second mortgage to my dad that much like his aforementioned rent he did not pay on time. He was so late on my payments that my dad could have legally taken the house back and did get a lawyer about it but in the end made the even worse decision to refinance the original agreement with a higher interest rate and a new due date. Third time's the charm right?

My mother on the other hand bought another home overseas in her native country, so it was obviously only a 10th of the price of a home here in Ontario but still she likes to take extravagant trips all the time and go to the Casino when she has all this debt. 

As I mentioned me and my husband live with her and my siblings in our old family home worth probably 750-800k. We were renting an apartment before but thought we could pay off our debt faster if we moved in with her so we did as well the living conditions in our apartment were one step above squalor. 

The smart thing to do would be to downsize the home if she cannot afford it, that would require me and my husband and maybe both my siblings moving out. While me and my husband don't mind moving out or moving to a smaller home with my mom my siblings have both thrown fits when my mother has brought this up. When I mention my mother's money problems neither is willing to contribute to the household. The youngest sibling is still in school as well as working and historically my parents and middle sibling have borrowed thousands of dollars from her and were constantly late on repayment so I don't blame her. But the middle sibling is a black hole for money despite working two part time jobs. She has loads of student debt from all her poor decision making and like my mother takes many trips overseas.

The second problem is that my mom always feels entitled to more than she deserves or than the market is willing to sell. She has put this house up on the market 3-4 times and when the real estate agents bring offers that are lower than the high end of our neighbourhood (850-900k) she blames them and switches agents. The trying to sell then getting miffed at the offers has been going on since before we moved in.

The current situation is that my dad has asked me to go on title for the home he leases out, which is actually profitable and in the same neighbourhood. This way he can get a mortgage to give my mom to cover my moms debts even though they are no longer married and she's been horrible to him. 

My thinking is this puts me on the line for their debts, my dad owes mortgage on the lease house to his brother still and probably a bit to the bank on the house he ""sold"" to the terrible renter.

Is there some other way I can help my mom out without taking on all this risk? My parents have skewed thinking where they think debt is good because it lets them do things with another person's money and I think their judgment in these situations is not at all reliable.

TLDR: My parents are bad with money, mom might lose the house. She should downsize but my adult siblings would whine about it. Dad wants me to go on title instead to get another mortgage.",finance,1422731986
personalfinance,Online Tax Software Help (Multiple States),"My apologies in advance, this might be a question that is easily answerable via 15-20 minutes of searching on the google, but I just got done entering my taxes into turbotax online and while beginning the review my last state (also my state of residence) I was kindly informed that TurboTax has a limit of 5 states (I worked in 6 and my company provided me with a W2 for each). So I had to delete one. I started deleting one, then realized that it will impact my state of residence's return because I can deduct the taxes I have paid to other states and it also might impact my federal return (not sure about that one still to irritated to think straight).

Does any one out there use any online tax software with 6 or more states? I am on a Mac, and figured online would be easiest, but I am open to buying a desktop version if it is good and will get everything I need done.

I was actually thinking about using another service, but thought TurboTax online would be better since I thought I could import in my data from Mint for charitable contributions and all. But apparently that doesn't work either.  I am irritated enough to just do everything all over again and never use TurboTax again.

personalfinance,Looking for perspective on home purchase in the next 12 months,"In a nutshell, the wife and I are contemplating a home purchase sometime in 2015.

**Basics:**

* At the end of the month, we have approx. 2500 bucks not going to bills, normal spending etc.  

* Currently we pay $1100 in rent for a 3 brm house.  

* We will probably have a kid over the next 2-3 years.

* I will likely get a promotion in the next 6 to 10 months, giving us an extra 700-1000 a month, and we have other reliable ways of generating more cash as needed.

* We have no savings, largely because we are hard charging through ridding ourselves of all debts (mostly from the student lifestyle) except the student loans and a Hyundai payment.  That 2500 goes straight to the credit card (probably paid off by April or May).  After that, it's approximately 900 bucks toward student loans and the car (which doesn't eat into that 2500 number).

* I am a disabled vet, and qualify for a 3.9% fixed rate loan, with free disaster / mortgage insurance.  That is supposed to knock off about 3-500 hundred bucks.

* Both my wife and I have a robust pension / retirement plan and excellent health coverage.

**My quandary:**

I get two pieces of advice.  One camp says ""stand on your toes"" and get the most you can possibly afford because over time you make more money, and inflation makes the payments easier.  My step-father could have got two extra bedrooms, for example, 18 years ago, for 200 bucks more a month, but opted to save the money, and regrets it because 200 bucks is cake today.

The other piece of advice is to get less than you can afford, and deal with a smaller house.  This, I guess, is the safer route.

I will be financing 100%, largely because the interest rate is fairly low, and frankly, housing is increasing 5-7% per year around here, which is faster than I will probably be able to save the equivalent down payment. The veteran loan I qualify for allows this, and is pretty reasonable.

Anyway, I am hoping to get some insight or thoughts from the fine folks here and see what you all think.",finance,1422733568

personalfinance,Thinking about buying an apartment for my parents to live in. How to structure this arrangement?,"My mother and stepfather have been in a dire financial situation for a few years now. They have embarked on new careers and are working hard to rebuild, but they've gone through all of their savings and I have had to pay all of their expenses for the past few months.

We all live in a high rent region. Their largest expense is rent. I am thinking about buying a one bedroom apartment which I would own and pay the taxes, common charges, and mortgage payments on but which they would live in. When they are able, they will cover the common charges, taxes, and mortgage payments as rent. 

Note that I am well aware of pitfalls of lending to family and the likelihood of never getting paid back. I am fortunate to be in a position where I can afford this, but I do want to be smart about it. I have a job and sufficient savings that I can afford to do this even if I am never paid back, and the area in which I would purchase an apartment is rapidly gentrifying, so I am confident that my investment will increase in value.

My concern is about how to structure this. I am aware that, if I allow my parents to live in an apartment I own while paying me nothing, the IRS will recognize the imputed value of rent as a gift from me to them, with its attendant tax consequences. My thinking is that I would charge them a sufficient rent and, for those months in which they couldn't afford to pay, loan them the rent value at the lowest allowable interest rate. I would draw up papers to that effect for each month they are unable to pay.

Is that the best way to structure this? Are there other possible structures I should consider?

That aside, I also got health care through the exchange starting in March. I told them that I would make $28,000 in 2014, which is what I made in 2013.  My premiums were $219 and they gave me a tax credit of $152 per month (so I was paying $67 each month). Obviously, I ended up making less than I had estimated.  When I entered all my information into the tax program, it told me I owed back $750 of that credit!  
~~I have no idea what went wrong and I am really upset.  If I didn't qualify for that credit, why did they give it to me?!
